We skip those. This is equivalent. We'll do the latter to exactly mimic the original. Steps for the third program:\n\n      char s[20];\n      sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);   // ans2 is the lucky number from the second program. int len_s = strlen(s);\n      int freq[256] = {0};\n      for (int i=0; i<len_s; i++) {\n          freq[(unsigned char)(s[i])]++;\n      }\n\n      int cnt = 0;\n      int x = 1; // true\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              if (cnt < 1) {\n                  cnt++;\n              } else {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (x) {\n          printf(\"First\\n\");\n      } else {\n          if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n              printf(\"Second\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  But note: the original program sets `x = True` at the beginning and then sets `x = False` only in the else branch.

However, note: the original second program starts with 0 and then appends 4 and 7. Then from 4: append 4 -> 44 (with two fours) -> then four=2, seven=0 -> not equal. Actually, we check: at 44: four=2, seven=0 -> not equal. So we don't add 44? Correction: the recursive call:\n\n      gen(0,0,0) -> then we call:\n          gen(0*10+4, 1,0) -> then from there, we call:\n             gen(4*10+4, 2,0) -> then at this call: number=44, four=2, seven=0 -> we check: if (number>0 and four==seven) -> 2==0? false. So we don't add 44. Then we call gen(4*10+7,1,1) -> number=47, four=1, seven=1 -> then we add 47. Similarly, from the first call with 7: we get 74 and 77. Then 74: 7 and 4 -> counts: one 7 and one 4 -> equal? Actually, the counts: four=1, seven=1 -> equal -> add 74. Then 77: four=0, seven=2 -> not equal. So the two-digit lucky numbers are 47 and 74. Then the smallest is 47? Therefore, our generation function must be fixed. The problem: we are counting the digits as we build. But when we build 44: we started with 0 then appended 4 (so we had a 4 -> four=1, then appended 4 again -> four=2). We never reset the counts. So the counts are the entire number. Therefore, 44: two fours and zero sevens -> not equal -> skip. So the two-digit numbers we have: 47 (four=1, seven=1) and 74 (four=1, seven=1). Then the smallest two-digit lucky number is 47? Then for input 2, we output 47. So the third program: the string \"47\" has two characters: '4' and '7'. \n        freq['4']=1, freq['7']=1 -> both are odd. Then: \n            first odd: cnt becomes 1 -> then second odd: we set x=0 and break. Then: x=0 and the length is 2 (even) -> output \"Second\". Therefore, the output is \"Second\". So we must generate correctly. How did the original Python program generate? def gen(number, four, seven):\n          if (number > limit): return\n          if (number > 0 and four == seven):\n              l.append(number) gen(number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven) gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1)\n\n      gen(0,0,0)\n\n      Then for two-digit:\n          Start with 0 -> then 4: (4,1,0) -> then 44: (44,2,0) -> skip.\n                  4 -> then 47: (47,1+1,0+1) = (47,2,1) -> skip? Actually: \n              gen(4,1,0) -> then first call: gen(44,2,0) -> skip. second call: gen(47,1,1) -> then we append 47? because 47>0 and 1==1 -> yes.\n\n          Similarly, from 0->7: \n              gen(7,0,1) -> then 74: (74,0+1,1+0)= (74,1,1) -> append. then 77: (77,0,2) -> skip. So the two-digit lucky numbers: 47 and 74. Therefore, we are correct. So the C program as written should be correct. We'll write the code accordingly. One more note: the first program's input: the list of n integers is on one line? The original Python: \n        r = [* map(int, input().split())] So we read the next line and split.

It then prints either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n However, note: The original chain of programs uses the output of one as the input to the next. We must capture the intermediate results without I/O.\n\n Plan for the C program:\n - We will run the first program by reading the initial input (n and the list of n integers).\n - Then we compute the result of the first program (an integer, let's call it `ans1`).\n - Then we use `ans1` as the input to the second program (so we don't print it and read again, but pass it directly).\n - The second program will generate the list of lucky numbers (up to a limit, which is 10000000000) and then find the smallest lucky number >= `ans1`. Let the result be `ans2`.\n - Then we convert `ans2` to a string (since the third program expects a string input). We must be cautious: the third program expects a string of digits (without any extra spaces or newlines).\n - The third program then processes this string and outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n Important: The third program in the original code reads from standard input. We are going to simulate that by having the string representation of `ans2` as the input for the third program.\n\n Steps in C:\n\n 1. Read the first input: an integer `n`, then `n` integers.\n 2. Compute the first program's result (ans1).\n 3. Use ans1 as the input for the second program (which generates lucky numbers and finds the next lucky number >= ans1). We'll generate the list of lucky numbers once (using recursion or iterative method) and then search.\n 4. Convert the found lucky number (ans2) into a string.\n 5. Process that string as the third program: count frequency of each char and check the conditions for forming a palindrome.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n For the second program:\n   - We need to generate all lucky numbers (with equal number of 4's and 7's) up to 10000000000 (10^10). We can do this by recursive generation (DFS) and then sort the list.\n\n For the third program:\n   - The input string is the string representation of the integer from the second program. Note: the integer might be large (up to 10^10) so we need a string of at most 11 characters.\n\n Steps:\n\n We break the C program into functions:\n\n  long long first_program(int n, int *r) {\n      long long ans = abs(r[0]);\n      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n          ans += abs(r[i] - r[i-1]);\n      }\n      return ans;\n  }\n\n  For the second program, we need to generate the list of lucky numbers. We'll do:\n\n  We note: the original Python uses recursion and a global list. We can do similarly in C.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the recursion depth is at most 11 (since the limit is 10^10, which is 11 digits). So we can do DFS.\n\n  We'll create a function to generate the numbers and store them in a global array. Then we sort.\n\n  But note: the original Python program calls `gen(0,0,0)`. However, note that the number 0 is generated and then we check `if (number>0 and four==seven)`. So we skip 0.\n\n  We'll generate all lucky numbers (with at least one digit) that have equal number of 4s and 7s and are <= limit (10000000000).\n\n  Then we'll search for the next lucky number >= the input (which is the output of the first program).\n\n  We'll design:\n\n      #define MAX_LUCKY 10000 // Actually, the total number of such numbers is not too big: for 2,4,6,8,10 digits: we have combinations. But 10 digits: C(10,5) = 252, and 8: C(8,4)=70, etc. So total is about 2*(1 + 6 + 70 + 252 + ...) but actually we generate by recursion. We can set a safe bound, say 1000.\n\n      long long lucky_list[1000];\n      int lucky_count = 0;\n\n      void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n          if (number > LIMIT) return;\n          if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n              lucky_list[lucky_count++] = number;\n          }\n          gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n          gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n      }\n\n      Then we sort the array (using qsort).\n\n  Then the second_program function:\n\n      long long second_program(long long n) {\n          // Generate the list (if not already generated? We'll generate once. Since we are going to call it once per run, it's fine.)\n          // But note: the original Python program calls gen(0,0,0) and then sorts. We do the same.\n          // However, we must reset lucky_count? But the program runs only once. We can generate once at the beginning of main? Or in the function. Since the problem runs the entire sequence once, we can generate once.\n\n          // Actually, we can generate the list once at the start of the program (in main) and then use it in second_program.\n\n          // But to be modular, we generate inside second_program and use static variable to generate only once.\n\n          // Alternatively, we generate in main and then call second_program.\n\n          // Let's generate in the function and use static flag.\n\n          static int generated = 0;\n          static long long list[1000];\n          static int count = 0;\n\n          if (!generated) {\n              generated = 1;\n              // call gen(0,0,0) and then sort\n              // we have to write gen as a helper that can fill the list. But we already have a global? Let's avoid global if possible.\n\n              // Alternatively, we can make a helper function that returns the list and count? But C doesn't have that.\n\n              // Instead, we'll make the list and count static in the function and use an internal gen.\n\n              // We'll write an internal recursive function? But C doesn't support nested functions in standard. So we can do iterative? Or we use external function with static storage.\n\n          We decide: we generate the list at the beginning of the entire program (in main) and then use it in the second program.\n\n          But the problem says: the entire sequence. We are free to restructure as long as the behavior is the same.\n\n          We'll generate the list of lucky numbers in main once, and then the second_program function will just use that precomputed list.\n\n      }\n\n  However, note: the second program in the original code is called with the output of the first. So we can precompute the list of lucky numbers at the start of the program (since it's constant) and then use it.\n\n  Steps in main:\n\n      Precompute the list of lucky numbers (using a recursive function) and sort.\n\n      Then:\n          Step 1: read the input for the first program.\n          Step 2: compute the first program's output (ans1).\n          Step 3: use the precomputed lucky list to find the smallest lucky number >= ans1 (ans2).\n          Step 4: convert ans2 to a string (without any extra characters, just the digits).\n          Step 5: run the third program on that string.\n\n  For the third program:\n\n      We have a string (say `s`). We need to:\n          - Count frequency of each character (digit). The string is composed of digits (from the lucky number, which is composed of 4 and 7? Actually, no: the lucky number is composed of 4 and 7, but the string representation of the lucky number will be a sequence of digits that are either '4' or '7'? Actually, no: the second program outputs a number which is composed of digits 4 and 7. So the string will only contain '4' and '7'. However, the third program is generic and would work for any string.\n\n      But note: the third program in the original code is:\n\n          s = list(input())\n          ... then count frequency of each character.\n\n      So we have to count the frequency of each distinct character (which in this case are only '4' and '7'). However, the code is general.\n\n      Conditions:\n          Count the number of characters that have odd frequency.\n          If we have at most one odd frequency, then we can form a palindrome? Actually, the condition for palindrome: \n            - If the length is even: every frequency must be even.\n            - If the length is odd: exactly one odd frequency.\n\n          The code in Python:\n            cnt = 0\n            x = True\n            for key, value in dt.items():\n                if value % 2 != 0:\n                    if cnt < 1:\n                        cnt += 1\n                    else:\n                        x = False\n                        break\n\n            Then:\n                if x: print(\"First\")\n                elif not x and len(s) % 2 == 0: print(\"Second\")\n                elif not x and len(s) % 2 != 0: print(\"First\")\n\n      Actually, the logic can be simplified: \n          The condition for forming a palindrome is that at most one character has an odd frequency.\n\n          But the output:\n            If the condition holds (x is True) -> \"First\"\n            Else, if the condition fails and the length is even -> \"Second\"\n            Else (condition fails and length is odd) -> \"First\"\n\n      However, note: if the condition fails, then we cannot form a palindrome by rearranging? But the problem is about a game? Actually, the problem might be from a game. But we just follow the code.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          Count the frequency of each character in the string (which is the string representation of the lucky number).\n\n          Then, count the number of characters that have odd frequency (call this `odd_count`).\n\n          Then:\n            if (odd_count <= 1) -> output \"First\"\n            else if (odd_count > 1) and (strlen(s) % 2 == 0) -> output \"Second\"\n            else -> output \"First\"\n\n      But note: the original code sets `x` to false when it encounters the second odd frequency. So if there are two or more odd frequencies, then `x` becomes false. Then:\n\n          if x: print(\"First\")\n          else:\n              if len(s) % 2 == 0: print(\"Second\")\n              else: print(\"First\")\n\n      This is equivalent to:\n\n          if (odd_count <= 1) \n              then \"First\"\n          else \n              if (strlen(s) % 2 == 0) then \"Second\" else \"First\"\n\n      However, note: the condition for the else branch: if the length is odd, then we output \"First\". Why? The original problem might be about a game of removing a character? We don't need to know, we just replicate.\n\n Implementation:\n\n      We'll have:\n\n          char s[20]; // enough for 64-bit integer (max 20 digits? but our lucky numbers are up to 10^10 -> 11 digits)\n\n          sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n\n          Then we build a frequency array for the digits? But note: the string contains only digits? But the lucky number is composed of 4 and 7? Actually, the lucky number is generated by the second program and is composed of digits 4 and 7. But the third program is general. However, we can use an array for all characters? But the string is a digit string. The characters are in the range '0' to '9'. But actually, the lucky number only has '4' and '7'. But we'll do a general frequency array for all characters.\n\n          However, the string might be only digits. We can use:\n\n             int freq[256] = {0};   // for ASCII\n\n          But the problem: the input to the third program is the string representation of the lucky number, which is a nonnegative integer. It does not have any non-digit.\n\n      Steps for frequency:\n\n          int freq[10] = {0};   // but note: we don't know if there are other digits? Actually, the lucky number only has 4 and 7. But to be general as the original code, we do by character.\n\n          Actually, the original code uses a dictionary that counts any character. So we do:\n\n          int freq[256] = {0};\n          int len_s = strlen(s);\n          for (i=0; i<len_s; i++) {\n              freq[(unsigned char)(s[i])]++;\n          }\n\n          Then we count the number of odd frequencies:\n\n          int odd_count = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n              if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                  odd_count++;\n              }\n          }\n\n          Then:\n\n          if (odd_count <= 1) {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          } else {\n              if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n                  printf(\"Second\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"First\\n\");\n          }\n\n      However, note: the original code does:\n\n          for key, value in dt.items():\n              if value % 2 != 0:\n                  if cnt < 1:\n                      cnt += 1\n                  else:\n                      x = False\n                      break\n\n          This counts the first odd frequency as allowed (and sets cnt to 1) and then if there's a second odd frequency, it breaks and sets x to False.\n\n          So the condition is: if there is at most one odd frequency -> x remains True.\n\n          Our method: count the total number of odd frequencies. Then:\n\n            if (odd_count <= 1) -> x is True.\n\n          So we are consistent.\n\n  But note: the original code also has:\n\n      x = True\n      ... then the for loop might set x to False.\n\n      Then:\n\n          if x: print(\"First\")\n          elif not x and len(s)%2==0: print(\"Second\")\n          else: print(\"First\")\n\n      So:\n\n          if (x) -> First.\n          else if (len(s)%2==0) -> Second.\n          else -> First.\n\n      Which is equivalent to:\n\n          if (odd_count <= 1) -> First.\n          else if (len(s) % 2 == 0) -> Second.\n          else -> First.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      int odd_count = 0;\n      for (i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) odd_count++;\n      }\n\n      if (odd_count <= 1) {\n          printf(\"First\\n\");\n      } else {\n          if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n              printf(\"Second\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  However, note: the original code sets `x` to false only when it finds the second odd frequency. If there are more than two, we break early? Actually, we break at the second one. But our method counts the total. But if we break early, we might not count beyond two? Actually, the condition is: if we have two or more odd frequencies then we break and set x=false. So if there are three, we break at the second and don't check the third? But then we don't know the total, we only know that there are at least two.\n\n  However, for the purpose of the condition: we only care if there is more than one. So we can break after we have found two. This is more efficient.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      int odd_count = 0;\n      int x = 1; // true\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              odd_count++;\n              if (odd_count > 1) {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      Then:\n\n      if (x) {\n          printf(\"First\\n\");\n      } else {\n          if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n              printf(\"Second\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  But note: if we break early, we don't traverse the whole frequency array? That's acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break when odd_count becomes 2 and set x=0.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      int odd_count = 0;\n      int x = 1; // true\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              odd_count++;\n              if (odd_count >= 2) {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      But note: if we break when we see the second odd, then we don't check the rest. This is the same as the original.\n\n  However, the original code breaks at the second odd. So we do:\n\n      int odd_count = 0;\n      int x = 1;\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              if (odd_count < 1) {\n                  odd_count = 1;\n              } else {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  Actually, the original:\n\n      for key, value in dt.items():\n          if value % 2 != 0:\n              if cnt < 1:\n                  cnt += 1\n              else:\n                  x = False\n                  break\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      int cnt = 0;\n      int x = 1;\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              if (cnt < 1) {\n                  cnt++;\n              } else {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  Then we use x.\n\n  But note: the frequency array might have zeros. We skip those.\n\n  This is equivalent.\n\n  We'll do the latter to exactly mimic the original.\n\n  Steps for the third program:\n\n      char s[20];\n      sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);   // ans2 is the lucky number from the second program.\n\n      int len_s = strlen(s);\n      int freq[256] = {0};\n      for (int i=0; i<len_s; i++) {\n          freq[(unsigned char)(s[i])]++;\n      }\n\n      int cnt = 0;\n      int x = 1; // true\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n              if (cnt < 1) {\n                  cnt++;\n              } else {\n                  x = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (x) {\n          printf(\"First\\n\");\n      } else {\n          if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n              printf(\"Second\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  But note: the original program sets `x = True` at the beginning and then sets `x = False` only in the else branch. Then after the loop, it checks `x`.\n\n  We do the same.\n\n  Now, the entire structure of the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <math.h>\n\n      #define LIMIT 10000000000LL\n      #define MAX_LUCKY 1000\n\n      // Global for lucky numbers: we precompute in main and then use in second_program\n      long long lucky_list[MAX_LUCKY];\n      int lucky_count = 0;\n\n      // Recursive function to generate lucky numbers\n      void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n          if (number > LIMIT) {\n              return;\n          }\n          if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n              if (lucky_count < MAX_LUCKY) {\n                  lucky_list[lucky_count++] = number;\n              }\n          }\n          gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n          gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n      }\n\n      // Comparison function for qsort\n      int cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n          long long x = *(const long long*)a;\n          long long y = *(const long long*)b;\n          if (x < y) return -1;\n          if (x > y) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          // Precompute the lucky numbers\n          gen(0, 0, 0);\n          qsort(lucky_list, lucky_count, sizeof(long long), cmp);\n\n          // Step 1: read input for the first program\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          int *r = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &r[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Compute the first program's result\n          long long ans1 = abs(r[0]);\n          for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n              ans1 += abs(r[i] - r[i-1]);\n          }\n\n          // Now, ans1 is the input to the second program: find the smallest lucky number >= ans1\n          long long ans2 = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<lucky_count; i++) {\n              if (lucky_list[i] >= ans1) {\n                  ans2 = lucky_list[i];\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          // Note: the original second program sets ans to 0 and then breaks when it finds the first. If none found, it remains 0? But the problem says the list is sorted and the last number is 4444477777 (which is 10 digits) and 10000000000 is the limit. But the input ans1 might be beyond the last lucky number? Then the original program would break without setting ans? Actually, in the original Python, it sets ans=0 at the beginning and then if it finds a lucky number >= n, it sets ans and breaks. If none is found, then ans remains 0? But that might be less than n? Then the problem? Actually, the problem says: the list l is sorted and then we break at the first >= n. But the largest lucky number is 7777777777? Actually, we generated up to 10^10. The last one is 4444444444 (10 fours) but that has 10 fours and 0 sevens -> not equal. Actually, the largest with equal? for 10 digits: 10 is even -> 5 fours and 5 sevens: the maximum number would be 7777744444? But we generated by DFS so we have all. The maximum is 7777777777 is not in the list (because it has 10 sevens, not 5). The largest is 7777744444? \n\n          Actually, we generated all numbers with equal number of 4s and 7s. For 10 digits, the maximum is 7777744444? But we also have 10-digit numbers that are larger? Actually, we generate by appending 4 or 7. The largest 10-digit lucky number is 7777744444? \n\n          But note: we break at 10000000000, so we have all numbers with up to 10 digits that have equal 4s and 7s.\n\n          The problem: if the input is greater than the maximum lucky number? Then the original program would output 0? But that 0 is generated by the initial assignment. However, the problem says: the lucky number must be >= n. If none exists, then 0 is output? But 0 is less than n (since n is positive). Then we have a problem.\n\n          The original program: \n              ans = 0\n              for val in l:\n                  if val>=n:\n                      ans=val\n                      break\n              print(ans)\n\n          So if no lucky number is found, it prints 0.\n\n          But the problem says: the lucky numbers are generated from positive numbers. And the input to the second program (ans1) is the output of the first program: which is a sum of absolute values, so it is nonnegative. But note: the first program: \n              ans = abs(r[0]) + ... \n          So it is nonnegative.\n\n          The smallest lucky number is 44? Actually, the smallest is 44? But we also have 47, 74, 4477, etc. Actually, the smallest is 44? Then if the input is 0, we output 44? But if the input is 10000000000, we output 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\n          Actually, the problem says the second program is called with the output of the first. The first program's output is at least 0. And the lucky numbers start at 44. So if the input is 0, we output 44. But if the input is 10000000000, we output 0? That is not a lucky number. The problem doesn't specify what to do if no lucky number is found? But the original program outputs 0.\n\n          However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we do the same.\n\n          But note: the problem says the second program is:\n\n              l = []\n              ... generate ...\n              n = int(input())\n              ans = 0\n              for val in l:\n                  if val>=n:\n                      ans=val\n                      break\n              print(ans)\n\n          So we output 0 if not found.\n\n          Therefore, in C: if we don't find any lucky number in the list (i.e., if the loop breaks without setting ans2), then ans2 remains 0? Actually, we set ans2 to 0 initially and then if we find one we set it and break. If we don't find, then ans2 remains 0.\n\n          So that's consistent.\n\n          // Step 2: convert ans2 to a string for the third program.\n\n          char s[20];\n          sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n\n          // Step 3: process the string as the third program.\n\n          int len_s = strlen(s);\n          int freq[256] = {0};   // frequency counts for each char\n\n          for (int i=0; i<len_s; i++) {\n              freq[(unsigned char)(s[i])]++;\n          }\n\n          int cnt = 0;\n          int x = 1; // true\n          for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n              if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                  if (cnt < 1) {\n                      cnt++;\n                  } else {\n                      x = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (x) {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          } else {\n              if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n                  printf(\"Second\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"First\\n\");\n              }\n          }\n\n          free(r);\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, note: the second program's generation: the original Python program calls gen(0,0,0) and then appends numbers that are positive and have four==seven. We do the same.\n\n  But note: the number 0 is generated and then skipped (because number>0). So we don't include 0.\n\n  Also, the list is sorted. We sort the list.\n\n  But note: we might generate duplicates? The generation: starting with 0, then 4 and 7, then 44,47,74,77, etc. and then 444, 447, etc. Each number is unique? Yes, because we are building by digits.\n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  One more note: the first program: \n      n = int(input())\n      r = list of n integers.\n\n      Then: \n          ans = abs(r[0])\n          for i in range(1, n): ans += abs(r[i]-r[i-1])\n\n      Example: if n=1, then we read one integer and then ans = abs(r[0]).\n\n      In C: we read n, then if n==0? The problem doesn't say n>=1? The first input is n, then n integers. The problem says: the first block. We assume n>=1? Because the Python code does r[0] and then the loop from 1 to n-1. If n==1, then the loop runs from 1 to 0? Actually, in Python: range(1,1) is empty. So it's safe.\n\n  But the problem: the first line is n, then the next line has n integers. We assume n>=1.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the absolute value functions: for integers in C: abs() for int, but the numbers might be large? The problem does not specify. We use long long for the first program? \n\n      The first program: \n          n can be up to? not specified. The integers in the list: the problem does not specify. But the second program uses a number that is the output of the first program, which is a sum of absolute differences. The second program then uses that number to find a lucky number. The lucky numbers are up to 10^10. So the first program's output must be within that.\n\n      We'll use long long for the first program's output.\n\n      But the input integers: we read as int? The problem does not specify the range. But the second program is limited to 10^10. If the first program's output is beyond 10^10, then the second program will output 0. Then the third program gets the string \"0\", which has one digit. The frequency: \n          freq['0'] = 1 -> odd frequency: cnt=0 -> cnt becomes 1 -> then no more odd? then x remains true -> output \"First\".\n\n      So we must use long long for the first program's output.\n\n      However, the input integers: the problem does not specify. We assume they are within the range of int? But the absolute differences might be large? The problem says: the entire chain. We must use long long for the accumulators.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n          long long ans1 = abs(r[0]);   // but r[0] is int, so abs(r[0]) is int. But we assign to long long: that's safe.\n\n          But if the absolute difference might be large? For example, if r[0] is -2000000000, then abs(r[0]) is 2000000000, which fits in int? But if the integers are large? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n      To be safe, we do:\n\n          long long ans1 = (long long)abs(r[0]);   // but if r[0] is INT_MIN, abs(INT_MIN) is undefined? So we use llabs? But the input is int. The problem: we read as int. The range of int is at least -32767 to 32767? But typically -2^31 to 2^31-1. And abs(INT_MIN) is undefined? So we convert to long long first?\n\n      We do:\n\n          long long ans1 = llabs((long long)r[0]);\n\n      But note: the input is read as int. Then we convert to long long for the absolute value.\n\n      Steps for the first program:\n\n          int *r = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &r[i]);\n          }\n\n          long long ans1 = 0;\n          if (n >= 1) {\n              ans1 = llabs((long long)r[0]);\n              for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n                  ans1 += llabs((long long)r[i] - (long long)r[i-1]);\n              }\n          }\n\n      But note: if n==0, the problem doesn't say. The input says: first integer is n. Then we read n integers. So n can be 0? The original Python program: \n          n = int(input())\n          r = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          then: for i in range(1, n): ... so if n==0, then the input for r would be an empty list? Then r[0] would be out of bounds.\n\n      The problem: we are guaranteed that the input is as described? We assume n>=1.\n\n  We'll assume n>=1.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We need to include <limits.h> for INT_MIN? Actually, we don't need to. We can use:\n\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <math.h>   // for llabs? Actually, in C99, we have llabs in stdlib.h.\n\n  Correction: llabs is in stdlib.h.\n\n  But we can do:\n\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <math.h>   // for abs? Actually, we use llabs from stdlib.h.\n\n  According to C99:\n\n      long long llabs(long long j);\n\n  So we convert the integers to long long and then take absolute value.\n\n  We do:\n\n      long long diff = (long long)r[i] - (long long)r[i-1];\n      ans1 += llabs(diff);\n\n  But note: the absolute value of the first element: we do:\n\n      ans1 = llabs((long long)r[0]);\n\n  So the code:\n\n      long long ans1 = llabs((long long)r[0]);\n      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n          long long diff = (long long)r[i] - (long long)r[i-1];\n          ans1 += llabs(diff);\n      }\n\n  Now, we are safe.\n\n  Final code structure:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <math.h>   // not needed for abs? but we include anyway.\n\n      // Actually, llabs is in stdlib.h?

The depth is at most 11 (because 10^10 has 11 digits) and each call makes two recursive calls. The total number of calls is about 2^11 = 2048, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the recursion depth is the length of the number in digits? Yes, and we stop at 11 digits. So the recursion depth is 11.\n\n  Therefore, it is safe.\n\n  Let's test with small inputs.\n\n  Example: \n      First program input: \n          1\n          10\n      Then: ans1 = abs(10) = 10.\n\n      Second program: find the smallest lucky number >=10 -> 44? Then output 44.\n\n      Third program: string \"44\" -> \n          freq['4']=2 -> even. \n          Then: no odd frequency -> x remains true -> output \"First\".\n\n  But the original second program: \n      It generates all lucky numbers and then finds the first >=10 -> 44.\n\n      Then the third program: \n          s = \"44\"\n          dt = {'4':2} -> for key,value: only one key, value%2==0 -> so no odd -> then x remains True -> \"First\".\n\n  So the output is \"First\".\n\n  Another test: \n      First program: \n          2\n          1 2\n      ans1 = abs(1) + abs(2-1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n      Second program: smallest lucky number >=2 -> 44? Actually, 44 is 44 which is >=2, but there are smaller? The list of lucky numbers: \n          We generate: \n            starting with 4 -> then 44,47,74,77, ... but also 4444? \n          Actually, the smallest lucky number is 44? \n          But we also generate numbers with 2 digits: 44,47,74,77. The smallest is 44.\n\n      So ans2=44.\n\n      Then third program: as above -> \"First\".\n\n  But wait: the original second program also generates numbers with 2 digits (since 2 is small). And 44 is the smallest? Actually, there are no lucky numbers with 1 digit? because 1 digit: we need one 4 and one 7? no, we need equal count. So 1 digit: not possible. 2 digits: 44,47,74,77. The smallest is 44.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  However, note: the original second program starts with 0 and then appends 4 and 7. Then from 4: append 4 -> 44 (with two fours) -> then four=2, seven=0 -> not equal. Actually, we check: at 44: four=2, seven=0 -> not equal. So we don't add 44? \n\n  Correction: the recursive call:\n\n      gen(0,0,0) -> then we call:\n          gen(0*10+4, 1,0) -> then from there, we call:\n             gen(4*10+4, 2,0) -> then at this call: number=44, four=2, seven=0 -> we check: if (number>0 and four==seven) -> 2==0? false. So we don't add 44.\n\n          Then we call gen(4*10+7,1,1) -> number=47, four=1, seven=1 -> then we add 47.\n\n      Similarly, from the first call with 7: we get 74 and 77. Then 74: 7 and 4 -> counts: one 7 and one 4 -> equal? Actually, the counts: four=1, seven=1 -> equal -> add 74.\n\n      Then 77: four=0, seven=2 -> not equal.\n\n      So the two-digit lucky numbers are 47 and 74.\n\n      Then the smallest is 47? \n\n      Therefore, our generation function must be fixed.\n\n  The problem: we are counting the digits as we build. But when we build 44: we started with 0 then appended 4 (so we had a 4 -> four=1, then appended 4 again -> four=2). We never reset the counts. So the counts are the entire number.\n\n  Therefore, 44: two fours and zero sevens -> not equal -> skip.\n\n  So the two-digit numbers we have: 47 (four=1, seven=1) and 74 (four=1, seven=1). \n\n  Then the smallest two-digit lucky number is 47? \n\n  Then for input 2, we output 47.\n\n  So the third program: the string \"47\" has two characters: '4' and '7'. \n        freq['4']=1, freq['7']=1 -> both are odd. \n        Then: \n            first odd: cnt becomes 1 -> then second odd: we set x=0 and break.\n        Then: x=0 and the length is 2 (even) -> output \"Second\".\n\n  Therefore, the output is \"Second\".\n\n  So we must generate correctly.\n\n  How did the original Python program generate?\n\n      def gen(number, four, seven):\n          if (number > limit):\n              return\n          if (number > 0 and four == seven):\n              l.append(number)\n          gen(number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven)\n          gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1)\n\n      gen(0,0,0)\n\n      Then for two-digit:\n          Start with 0 -> then 4: (4,1,0) -> then 44: (44,2,0) -> skip.\n                  4 -> then 47: (47,1+1,0+1) = (47,2,1) -> skip? \n          Actually: \n              gen(4,1,0) -> then first call: gen(44,2,0) -> skip.\n              second call: gen(47,1,1) -> then we append 47? because 47>0 and 1==1 -> yes.\n\n          Similarly, from 0->7: \n              gen(7,0,1) -> then 74: (74,0+1,1+0)= (74,1,1) -> append.\n              then 77: (77,0,2) -> skip.\n\n      So the two-digit lucky numbers: 47 and 74.\n\n  Therefore, we are correct.\n\n  So the C program as written should be correct.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the first program's input: the list of n integers is on one line? The original Python: \n        r = [* map(int, input().split())]\n\n      So we read the next line and split. In C: we read n integers from stdin. They can be on one line? We assume they are separated by whitespace.\n\n      The first scanf reads n. Then the next n integers can be read with a loop of scanf.\n\n      This will read from the same line if they are on the same line? Or the next line? The problem: the input format is:\n\n          n\n          a1 a2 ... an\n\n      So we read n, then the next line has n integers.\n\n      The scanf for integers will skip whitespace, so it will read the next integers from the next line.\n\n  Therefore, it is correct.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      Note: We use llabs for long long absolute value.\n\n      We must include stdlib.h for llabs? In C99, yes.\n\n      Compilation: with C99.\n\n  Code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      #define LIMIT 10000000000LL\n      #define MAX_LUCKY 1000\n\n      long long lucky_list[MAX_LUCKY];\n      int lucky_count = 0;\n\n      void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n          if (number > LIMIT) {\n              return;\n          }\n          if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n              if (lucky_count < MAX_LUCKY) {\n                  lucky_list[lucky_count++] = number;\n              }\n          }\n          gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n          gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n      }\n\n      int cmp_ll(const void *a, const void *b) {\n          long long x = *(const long long*)a;\n          long long y = *(const long long*)b;\n          if (x < y) return -1;\n          if (x > y) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          // Generate the lucky numbers\n          gen(0, 0, 0);\n          qsort(lucky_list, lucky_count, sizeof(long long), cmp_ll);\n\n          // First program input\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          int *r = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &r[i]);\n          }\n\n          // First program computation\n          long long ans1 = llabs((long long)r[0]);\n          for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n              long long diff = (long long)r[i] - (long long)r[i-1];\n              ans1 += llabs(diff);\n          }\n\n          // Second program: find smallest lucky number >= ans1\n          long long ans2 = 0; // default to 0 if not found\n          for (int i = 0; i < lucky_count; i++) {\n              if (lucky_list[i] >= ans1) {\n                  ans2 = lucky_list[i];\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Third program: convert ans2 to string and check for palindrome possibility\n          char s[20];\n          sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n          int len_s = strlen(s);\n\n          int freq[256] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n          for (int i = 0; i < len_s; i++) {\n              unsigned char c = s[i];\n              freq[c]++;\n          }\n\n          int cnt = 0;\n          int x = 1; // true\n          for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n              if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                  if (cnt < 1) {\n                      cnt++;\n                  } else {\n                      x = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (x) {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          } else {\n              if (len_s % 2 == 0) {\n                  printf(\"Second\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"First\\n\");\n              }\n          }\n\n          free(r);\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  Note: we use `llabs` from stdlib.h. In some compilers, we might need to define _ISOC99_SOURCE? But usually it's available.\n\n  If not, we can define:\n\n      #if !defined(llabs) && !defined(__APPLE__) // example\n      #define llabs(x) ((x) < 0 ? -(x) : (x))\n      #endif\n\n  But we'll rely on the standard library.\n\n  This should be the complete solution."
