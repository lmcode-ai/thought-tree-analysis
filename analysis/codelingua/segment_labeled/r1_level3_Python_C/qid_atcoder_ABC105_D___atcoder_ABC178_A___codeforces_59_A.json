But if the last group is one element? Then count=1, and we add 0? That's correct. But if the last group is multiple elements? Then we break the loop and then add the last group. However, we start with count=1 (for the first element). Then for i from 1 to N (inclusive) we compare with the previous? Actually, we start at i=1 (which is the second element) and compare to i-1=0. Then when we break a group, we reset count to 1 for the new element. Then at the end, we add the last group. This is correct. But note: the cumulative remainders array might be [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] (for example). Then:\n\n            i=1: compare index0 (0) and index1 (1): not equal -> add 1*(0)/2 = 0, then set count=1 for the new group (value=1) -> then we see index1 and index2: both 1 -> count becomes 2. i=2: compare index1 (1) and index2 (1): equal -> count=2 -> then i=3: compare index2 (1) and index3 (2): not equal -> add 2*1/2 = 1 -> then set count=1 for 2.\n            i=4: 2 and 2: count becomes 2 -> then i=5: 2 and then next? we break? but we are at i=5: compare index4 and index5? both 2 -> count becomes 3? Then at i=6 we break the loop? Actually, our loop runs for i from 1 to N (so for i in [1, N] -> total N times). The array has indices 0..N (so N+1 elements). We start at i=1 (comparing element0 and element1) and go to i=N (comparing element N-1 and element N). Then after the loop, we add the last group: which is the group of the last element? But we haven't added the group that ended at the last element? Actually, the last group we are in is still active. So we add it. This is correct. However, we can also do:\n\n            total = 0;\n            count = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {   // we traverse from 0 to N-1, and compare i and i+1\n                if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i+1]) {\n                    count++;\n                } else {\n                    total += count*(count-1)/2;\n                    count = 1;\n                }\n            }\n            total += count*(count-1)/2;\n\n        But note: if we do this, then we are traversing from i=0 to i=N-1 (so N times) and we are comparing element i and i+1. Then at the end, we add the last group. This is also correct. But in our code we did:\n\n            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i-1]) ...   // this is the same as the above? Actually, we are using the same idea. Therefore, the code above is correct. Let's test with a small example:\n\n            N=3, M=2, A = [1,2,3]\n\n            Then cum_remainders[0]=0\n            i=1: A[0]=1 -> mod_A = 1 %2 =1 -> cum[1] = (0+1)%2 =1\n            i=2: A[1]=2 -> mod_A=0 -> cum[2]=(1+0)%2=1\n            i=3: A[2]=3 -> mod_A=1 -> cum[3]=(1+1)%2=0\n\n            Then cum_remainders = [0,1,1,0]\n\n            Sort: [0,0,1,1]\n\n            Then groups: \n                first group: 0,0 -> count=2 -> add 1\n                second group: 1,1 -> count=2 -> add 1 -> total=2. Then output: 0 (because 2 !=0) -> so \"0\"\n\n        The first program: \n            combinations = 2 -> prints 2\n            Then second program: reads 2 -> prints 0\n            Then third program: reads \"0\" -> prints \"0\"\n\n        So our program outputs \"0\", which is correct. Another test: \n            N=1, M=2, A=[2]\n            cum_remainders[0]=0\n            i=1: A[0]=2 -> mod_A=0 -> cum[1] = (0+0)%2=0\n            Then cum = [0,0] -> sorted [0,0]\n            total = 1 (from 0,0: 2 choose 2 = 1) -> then output 0? But the first program: \n                combinations = 1 -> prints 1\n                second program: 1 !=0 -> prints 0\n                third: prints 0. Our program: total=1 -> then output 0. But what if we have no subarray? Actually, the cumulative array [0,0] gives one pair: (0,0) -> the subarray from index0 to index0? That's the empty subarray? Or from index0 to index1? The first program: \n            It does: cum_remainders = [0, ...] and then counts pairs (i<j) such that cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[j]. The subarray from i to j-1 is the one that sums to a multiple of M.\n\n            In our example: \n                cum = [0,0] -> the pairs: (0,1) -> the subarray from index0 to index1? But that corresponds to A[0:1] which is [2].",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into one C program.\n The first program reads two integers N and M, then a list of N integers (array A).\n It computes the number of contiguous subarrays whose sum is divisible by M.\n\n The second program reads an integer and prints 1 if the integer is 0, else 0. However, note that the second program in the chain would take the output of the first as its input. But the first program outputs a single integer (combinations). So the second program reads that integer and then prints 1 if it was 0, else 0.\n\n The third program reads a string (which would be the output of the second program, which is either \"0\" or \"1\" but note the second program outputs either 0 or 1 without any spaces) and then converts it to either all upper or all lower based on the count of upper and lower case letters. However, the input to the third program is a string of one character (either '0' or '1')? But wait, the second program outputs a single digit and then the third program reads a whole string? Actually, the third program expects a string. The output of the second program is a string of one digit and a newline? But in the third program, we are using `input()` which reads a whole line.\n\n However, note the chain:\n\n   Program 1: prints an integer (without any extra spaces, just the integer and then a newline? Yes, because print in Python adds a newline)\n\n   Program 2: reads that integer by reading a line and stripping. So it reads the string without the newline? Then converts to integer.\n\n   Then program 2 prints either \"0\" or \"1\" (without quotes) and then a newline.\n\n   Program 3: reads the entire line which is either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\" but then `input()` in Python strips the newline? Actually, `input()` in Python reads and returns a line without the trailing newline.\n\n   So the string that program 3 gets is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n   Then it counts the number of lower and upper case letters. In a string that is either \"0\" or \"1\", both are digits. So they are not letters. Therefore, both `cl` and `cu` will be 0. Then `cu` (0) is not greater than `cl` (0), so it prints the string in lower case.\n\n   Therefore, the third program will output either \"0\" or \"1\" in lower case, which is the same as the input.\n\n But wait, the third program does:\n   if cu > cl: convert to upper\n   else: convert to lower.\n\n   Since both are 0, it does lower. So \"0\" becomes \"0\", and \"1\" becomes \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, the output of the entire chain is the same as the output of the second program? Then why the third program?\n\n   Actually, the third program is applied to the output of the second program, which is a string of one character. Since that character is a digit, it has no case. So the conversion to upper or lower does nothing? Then it just prints the same string? So the third program is effectively a no-op? \n\n However, let's check the Python code for the third program with input \"0\" or \"1\":\n   For each character in the string (which is one character):\n        if it is lower? Digits are not letters, so both `cl` and `cu` remain 0.\n   Then because cu (0) is not greater than cl (0), we do `txt.lower()`. \n   Since the string is \"0\", then \"0\".lower() is \"0\". Similarly for \"1\".\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input to the entire chain: first line: N M, second line: array of N integers.\n\n   Output of first program: an integer (say, x)\n\n   Output of second program: \n        if x == 0 -> print \"1\"\n        else -> print \"0\"\n\n   Then third program: \n        reads the string (either \"1\" or \"0\") and then outputs the same.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain outputs \"1\" if the number of contiguous subarrays divisible by M is 0, otherwise \"0\".\n\n But note: the second program does:\n        a = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n        print(1 if a==0 else 0)\n\n   So if the first program outputs 0, then the second outputs 1; if the first outputs non-zero, the second outputs 0.\n\n   Then the third program just outputs the same as the second.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain: \n        Read N, M and an array of N integers.\n        Compute the number of contiguous subarrays with sum divisible by M (let that be x).\n        Then output 1 if x==0, else 0.\n\n However, wait: the second program is run only once? Yes, because tcs=1 and tc goes from 1 to 1.\n\n But note: the first program outputs a single integer (x). The second program reads that integer and then outputs either 0 or 1. The third program then reads that 0 or 1 and outputs the same.\n\n So the entire chain: \n        Input: \n            First line: N M\n            Second line: list of N integers\n\n        Output: \n            \"1\" if the number of contiguous subarrays (with sum divisible by M) is 0, else \"0\"\n\n However, note the second program is designed to run one test case. But the first program does not have test cases. It just reads one input.\n\n How to translate the first program to C?\n\n   The first program:\n        Reads N and M.\n        Then reads an array A of N integers.\n\n        Then computes:\n            cum_remainders = (np.hstack([0, A]) % M).cumsum() % M\n\n        Explanation:\n            It creates an array that starts with 0, then the elements of A, then takes modulo M for each.\n            Then does cumulative sum, then modulo M again.\n\n        Then it counts the frequency of each remainder in the cumulative array.\n\n        Then for each frequency count, it adds count*(count-1)//2.\n\n        This is the standard way to count subarrays with sum divisible by M: \n            We note that if two indices i and j (i<j) have the same cumulative remainder, then the subarray from i+1 to j has a sum divisible by M.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n        Step 1: Read N and M.\n        Step 2: Read the array A of N integers.\n\n        Step 3: \n            We need to compute an array `cum_remainders` of length N+1 (index 0 to N).\n            cum_remainders[0] = 0.\n            Then for i from 1 to N:\n                cum_remainders[i] = (cum_remainders[i-1] + A[i-1]) % M\n\n            But note: the original does modulo at two steps: first each element mod M, then cumulative mod M. However, we can do cumulative mod M without first modding each element? \n            Actually, (a+b) mod M = ( (a mod M) + (b mod M) ) mod M, so we can do:\n\n                cum_remainders[i] = (cum_remainders[i-1] + (A[i-1] % M)) % M\n\n            But note: A[i-1] might be negative? The problem does not specify. However, modulo for negative numbers in Python is non-negative. In C, we can adjust to get non-negative.\n\n        Step 4: Count the frequencies of each value in cum_remainders (which are in the range [0, M-1]?).\n\n        Step 5: For each frequency count, compute combinations = count * (count-1) / 2.\n\n        Step 6: Then we pass this combinations (an integer) to the next step.\n\n        Step 7: The next step (which is the second program) will convert:\n                if combinations == 0 -> output 1\n                else -> output 0\n\n        But note: the entire chain output is then 1 or 0? However, the third program then reads that output and does nothing (as we reasoned) and then outputs the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the third program? Because it doesn't change the digit. But to be faithful, we must do:\n\n            We have an integer `combinations` from step 5.\n\n            Then we set a variable `a = combinations`.\n            Then we set `b = (a == 0) ? 1 : 0;`\n\n            Then we have to output `b` as a string? But then the third program would read that string and do the case conversion? However, the string is a single digit and has no letters. So converting to upper or lower does nothing.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply output `b` as an integer? But note the third program outputs a string? Actually, the third program outputs a string without a newline? No, the third program uses `print(out)` which adds a newline.\n\n        The entire chain output: \n            Program1: prints an integer without any extra (and a newline)\n            Program2: prints an integer without any extra (and a newline) -> but note the second program: it prints either \"1\" or \"0\" and then a newline.\n            Program3: then prints the same string (which is one character) and then a newline.\n\n        So the final output is either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\".\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if (combinations == 0) \n                printf(\"1\\n\");\n            else\n                printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n        But wait, the third program would output the same as the second? So why not skip the third? Because the third program is a no-op? \n\n        However, the problem says: translate the entire sequence. So we must mimic the entire behavior.\n\n        But note: the third program is reading the output of the second program. The output of the second program is a string of one digit and a newline. However, the third program uses `input()` which in Python reads until a newline and then strips the newline? Actually, `input()` in Python reads a line and returns it without the trailing newline. Then the string is just the digit.\n\n        Then the third program counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in that string (which has none). Then it outputs the entire string in lower case (so the digit remains the same). Then it prints that string and a newline.\n\n        Therefore, the third program effectively outputs the same digit and a newline.\n\n        So we can skip the third program? But the problem says to not insert I/O in the middle. However, the entire chain output is the same as the output of the second program? So we can just output the same as the second program? \n\n        However, what if the output of the second program was a multi-letter string? Then the third program would change the case. But in our case, it's a single digit. Therefore, the third program is redundant.\n\n        But to be safe and general, we note that the third program is applied to the output string of the second program. The second program outputs either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\". Then the third program reads that and the `input()` function returns the string without the newline, so it's \"0\" or \"1\". Then the third program does:\n\n            cu = 0, cl = 0\n            for each char in the string: \n                if char is lowercase -> cl++ \n                else if char is uppercase -> cu++\n\n            But note: the digits are not letters. So both remain 0.\n\n            Then: if cu > cl -> convert the whole string to uppercase? else to lowercase.\n\n            Since cu==0 and cl==0, we go to the else: convert to lowercase.\n\n            Converting a string of digits to lowercase does nothing.\n\n            Then we output the string and a newline.\n\n        Therefore, the third program outputs the same as the second program? So we can simply output the same as the second program? \n\n        But note: the second program outputs a string with a newline, then the third program outputs the same string (without changing) and a newline? So the entire output would have two newlines? \n\n        Actually, the chain:\n\n            Program1: prints (say) 3 -> \"3\\n\"\n            Program2: reads the \"3\\n\", then outputs \"0\\n\"\n            Program3: reads the \"0\\n\" (but `input()` returns \"0\"), then outputs \"0\\n\"\n\n        So the entire output is \"0\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to output two newlines? We just output one.\n\n        And in our C program, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Read N, M and the array.\n\n            Step 2: Compute the number of subarrays (x).\n\n            Step 3: \n                if x == 0, then we output \"1\\n\"\n                else, output \"0\\n\"\n\n        But wait, the third program would output a newline? And we are only outputting one newline? But note: the entire chain output is one line. The third program outputs one line. So we output one line.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain output is one line: either \"1\" or \"0\", then a newline.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (x == 0) \n                printf(\"1\\n\");\n            else\n                printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n        However, the problem says to combine the entire sequence. But note the third program is not changing the content. So we are safe.\n\n        But what if the third program changed the output? For example, if the second program outputted a string with letters? Then we would have to convert to lower. But in this specific chain, the second program outputs a digit. So we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically\". Since the third program doesn't change the digit, we can skip it.\n\n        But to be absolutely faithful, we could simulate the third program? \n\n        We have the output of the second program: it's a string of one character (either '0' or '1') and then we would do:\n\n            Count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters? -> 0 and 0.\n            Then convert the string to lowercase? -> same string.\n\n        Then output that string and a newline.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            char *output_second = (x == 0) ? \"1\" : \"0\";\n            // Then we have a string `output_second` of length 1 (without newline) for the third program.\n\n            // Now, we want to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in output_second?\n            // But there are none.\n\n            // Then we output the string in lowercase? which is the same.\n\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", output_second);\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", (x==0) ? \"1\" : \"0\");\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the C program:\n\n            Steps:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n\n            // We'll use an array for the cumulative remainders and a frequency table for remainders (from 0 to M-1)\n\n            int main() {\n                int N, M;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n                // Allocate array A of N integers\n                int *A = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n                }\n\n                // We'll compute cumulative remainders: length N+1\n                long long *cum_remainders = (long long*)malloc((N+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                // We use long long to avoid overflow? But the problem says dtype=np.int64. So we use long long.\n\n                // But note: the cumulative sums modulo M are in the range [0, M-1]. So we can use int for the cumulative mod? \n                // However, the array A might be large? But the modulo M keeps the numbers in [0, M-1]. So we can use int for the mod values.\n\n                // But the cumulative sum might be large? We do mod M at every step.\n\n                // Let me change: we do mod at every step.\n\n                // Frequency counter: we can use an array of size M? Because remainders are in [0, M-1]. But M can be up to 10^9? \n                // In the first program, they use Counter which is a dictionary. Because M can be large? \n\n                // How to handle large M? We cannot allocate an array of size M if M is 10^9.\n\n                // Alternative: use a hash map? But C doesn't have one in standard. We can use a balanced BST? But that's complicated.\n\n                // Alternatively, note that we have only N+1 remainders. We can sort the cum_remainders array and then count.\n\n                // Steps:\n\n                cum_remainders[0] = 0;\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    // We do: (cum_remainders[i-1] + A[i-1]) % M\n                    // But to handle negative, we do: \n                    //   Let x = cum_remainders[i-1] + A[i-1];\n                    //   Then mod = (x % M + M) % M;   to get non-negative.\n\n                    long long x = cum_remainders[i-1] + A[i-1];\n                    // We do modulo arithmetic: we want non-negative modulo.\n                    long long mod = x % M;\n                    if (mod < 0) mod += M;\n                    mod %= M; // This might be redundant, but to be safe.\n                    cum_remainders[i] = mod;\n                }\n\n                // Now, we want to count the frequency of each value in cum_remainders (for indices 0..N)\n\n                // Since M might be large, we sort the cum_remainders array (which has N+1 elements) and then traverse to count.\n\n                qsort(cum_remainders, N+1, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n                // Now traverse and count\n                long long total_combinations = 0;\n                long long current = cum_remainders[0];\n                long long count = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    if (cum_remainders[i] == current) {\n                        count++;\n                    } else {\n                        total_combinations += count * (count - 1) / 2;\n                        current = cum_remainders[i];\n                        count = 1;\n                    }\n                }\n                total_combinations += count * (count - 1) / 2;\n\n                // Now, total_combinations is the value we computed.\n\n                // Then the second program: if total_combinations == 0, then output 1, else 0.\n\n                if (total_combinations == 0) {\n                    printf(\"1\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"0\\n\");\n                }\n\n                // Free memory\n                free(A);\n                free(cum_remainders);\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n            We need a comparison function for qsort:\n\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long arg1 = *(const long long*)a;\n                long long arg2 = *(const long long*)b;\n                if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n                if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, note: the cumulative remainders are computed modulo M, so they are in the range [0, M-1]. But we are using long long? But M is an int? The problem says N, M are integers. But the array A is of integers? \n\n        The problem says: \n            N, M = [int(x) for x in ...]\n            A = array of int\n\n        But in the first program, they use np.int64 for A? But then the cumulative sum might be large? So we use long long for cum_remainders? \n\n        But the modulo M: if M is int, then the remainder is in the range [0, M-1] and M is at most 10^9? So we can store in an int? But the cumulative sum before mod might be very large? So we use long long for the cumulative sum.\n\n        However, the modulo operation: \n            (a + b) mod M = (a mod M + b mod M) mod M, but we are doing mod at every step? So we can avoid long long? \n\n        But the problem says A is of type np.int64? So we must handle 64-bit integers. Therefore, we use long long.\n\n        Also, note: the array A might have negative numbers? The problem doesn't specify. So we do:\n\n            mod = (x % M + M) % M;   // to get non-negative mod.\n\n        However, the first program uses modulo operation in Python which returns non-negative. So we do the same.\n\n        Now, what are the constraints? The problem doesn't specify. We assume that N can be up to 10^5? Then sorting is O(N log N) which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        One more note: the first program does:\n\n            cum_remainders = (np.hstack([0, A]) % M).cumsum() % M\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            Let B = [0] + A\n            Then C = [B[0] % M, B[1] % M, ...]\n            Then D = cumulative sum of C, then mod M.\n\n        But note: \n            D[0] = C[0] = 0\n            D[1] = (C[0] + C[1]) % M = (0 + A[0]%M) % M = A[0]%M\n            D[2] = (C[0]+C[1]+C[2]) % M = (0 + A[0]%M + A[1]%M) % M\n\n        But we are doing:\n\n            cum_remainders[0] = 0\n            cum_remainders[1] = (0 + A[0]) % M   [with non-negative mod]\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            = (A[0] mod M) mod M = A[0] mod M.\n\n        Then cum_remainders[2] = (cum_remainders[1] + A[1]) % M = (A[0] mod M + A[1]) % M.\n\n        However, note: (a mod M + b) mod M = (a + b) mod M? Yes, but also (a mod M + b mod M) mod M = (a+b) mod M.\n\n        So we can also do:\n\n            We can compute: \n                cum_remainders[i] = (cum_remainders[i-1] + (A[i-1] % M)) % M\n\n        But to avoid negative, we do:\n\n            long long temp = (A[i-1] % M);\n            if (temp < 0) temp += M;\n            then mod = (cum_remainders[i-1] + temp) % M;\n            if (mod < 0) mod += M;   // but non-negative mod? because temp is non-negative and cum_remainders[i-1] is non-negative? \n\n        Actually, we made sure that cum_remainders[i-1] is non-negative. And temp is non-negative. Then mod should be non-negative? \n\n        But (a+b) mod M might be negative? Actually, if a and b are non-negative and less than M, then a+b is non-negative and less than 2*M. Then mod is in [0, 2*M-1]? Then we do mod % M: which is [0, M-1]. But if we do (a+b) % M, it can be in [0, M-1]? \n\n        Actually, the % operator in C for positive numbers is non-negative? But for negative? We are avoiding by making A[i-1] mod M non-negative. Then cum_remainders[i-1] is non-negative. Then the sum is non-negative. Then mod = (a+b) % M: this can be from 0 to M-1? \n\n        However, if a+b is positive and less than M, then mod = a+b, which is positive and less than M. If a+b >= M, then mod = a+b - M, which is in [0, M-1]? Actually, if a+b is in [M, 2*M), then mod = a+b - M which is in [0, M). \n\n        But note: a and b are in [0, M-1]. So a+b in [0, 2*M-2]. Then mod = (a+b) % M: \n            if a+b < M: then mod = a+b -> non-negative and less than M.\n            if a+b >= M: then mod = a+b - M -> non-negative and less than M? because a+b <= 2*M-2, so a+b-M <= M-2 which is less than M.\n\n        So we don't need to adjust mod again? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the sign of A. So we do:\n\n            long long temp = A[i-1] % M;\n            if (temp < 0) temp += M;\n\n        Then:\n\n            cum_remainders[i] = (cum_remainders[i-1] + temp) % M;\n\n        And then we make sure: if that result is negative? Actually, the modulus of a non-negative number by M is non-negative? \n\n        But: (a+b) % M: if a and b are non-negative, then a+b is non-negative, and the modulus is non-negative? \n\n        However, the modulus operation in C for non-negative numbers is non-negative. So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the cumulative sum might be huge? We are doing mod at every step? So the cum_remainders[i] is always in [0, M-1] and we are storing it as long long? But M is int? Actually, M is read as int. But M can be up to 10^9? Then the mod value is at most 10^9? So we can store in int? But then why did the first program use np.int64? \n\n        Actually, the cumulative remainders are stored as integers. They are in the range [0, M-1]. If M is 10^9, then we can store in a 32-bit int? But the problem says the array A is np.int64? But the remainders are modulo M, so they are at most 10^9? So we can use int? But the cumulative sum before mod might be very large? We are using mod to keep the numbers small.\n\n        However, the frequency array: we have N+1 numbers, each in [0, M-1]. We are going to sort them. We can use an array of long long? But if M is big, we cannot use an array of size M, but we can sort the array of N+1 elements.\n\n        So we use:\n\n            long long *cum_remainders = (long long*)malloc((N+1)*sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            qsort(cum_remainders, N+1, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n        And the comparison function for long long.\n\n        Now, what if M is 0? The problem says M is at least 1? Because in the first program, they are doing modulo M and then cumulative sum mod M. So we assume M>=1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long arg1 = *(const long long*)a;\n                long long arg2 = *(const long long*)b;\n                if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n                if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n            int main() {\n                int N, M;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n                int *A = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n                }\n\n                long long *cum_remainders = (long long*)malloc((N+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                cum_remainders[0] = 0;\n\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    // Compute mod for A[i-1]\n                    long long mod_A = A[i-1] % M;\n                    if (mod_A < 0) {\n                        mod_A += M;\n                    }\n                    // Now mod_A is in [0, M-1]\n                    long long temp = cum_remainders[i-1] + mod_A;\n                    // Now compute mod for temp\n                    long long mod_temp = temp % M;\n                    if (mod_temp < 0) {\n                        mod_temp += M;\n                    }\n                    mod_temp %= M; // This is redundant? because we added M if negative? But to be safe, we do mod again?\n                    // Actually, we can do: mod_temp = temp % M; and then adjust to non-negative.\n\n                    // Alternatively, we can do: mod_temp = (temp % M + M) % M;\n                    mod_temp = (temp % M + M) % M;\n                    cum_remainders[i] = mod_temp;\n                }\n\n                // Now sort the cum_remainders array (of N+1 elements)\n                qsort(cum_remainders, N+1, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n                // Now traverse to count frequencies\n                long long total = 0;\n                long long count = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i-1]) {\n                        count++;\n                    } else {\n                        total += count*(count-1)/2;\n                        count = 1;\n                    }\n                }\n                total += count*(count-1)/2;\n\n                // Now, total is the number of subarrays.\n\n                if (total == 0) {\n                    printf(\"1\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"0\\n\");\n                }\n\n                free(A);\n                free(cum_remainders);\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, note: the cumulative array might have duplicate remainders that are not adjacent after sorting? But we sorted, so they are adjacent.\n\n        But what about the last group? We break at the first non-equal, and then we add the last group after the loop.\n\n        But note: the array has N+1 elements. We start at index0, then compare index0 and index1, then index1 and index2, ... until index N (the last). Then after the loop, we add the last group.\n\n        But if the last group is one element? Then count=1, and we add 0? That's correct.\n\n        But if the last group is multiple elements? Then we break the loop and then add the last group.\n\n        However, we start with count=1 (for the first element). Then for i from 1 to N (inclusive) we compare with the previous? Actually, we start at i=1 (which is the second element) and compare to i-1=0.\n\n        Then when we break a group, we reset count to 1 for the new element.\n\n        Then at the end, we add the last group.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the cumulative remainders array might be [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] (for example). Then:\n\n            i=1: compare index0 (0) and index1 (1): not equal -> add 1*(0)/2 = 0, then set count=1 for the new group (value=1) -> then we see index1 and index2: both 1 -> count becomes 2.\n            i=2: compare index1 (1) and index2 (1): equal -> count=2 -> then i=3: compare index2 (1) and index3 (2): not equal -> add 2*1/2 = 1 -> then set count=1 for 2.\n            i=4: 2 and 2: count becomes 2 -> then i=5: 2 and then next? we break? but we are at i=5: compare index4 and index5? both 2 -> count becomes 3? Then at i=6 we break the loop? \n\n        Actually, our loop runs for i from 1 to N (so for i in [1, N] -> total N times). The array has indices 0..N (so N+1 elements). \n\n        We start at i=1 (comparing element0 and element1) and go to i=N (comparing element N-1 and element N).\n\n        Then after the loop, we add the last group: which is the group of the last element? But we haven't added the group that ended at the last element? Actually, the last group we are in is still active. So we add it.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            total = 0;\n            count = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {   // we traverse from 0 to N-1, and compare i and i+1\n                if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i+1]) {\n                    count++;\n                } else {\n                    total += count*(count-1)/2;\n                    count = 1;\n                }\n            }\n            total += count*(count-1)/2;\n\n        But note: if we do this, then we are traversing from i=0 to i=N-1 (so N times) and we are comparing element i and i+1. Then at the end, we add the last group. This is also correct.\n\n        But in our code we did:\n\n            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i-1]) ...   // this is the same as the above? \n\n            Actually, we are using the same idea.\n\n        Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n        Let's test with a small example:\n\n            N=3, M=2, A = [1,2,3]\n\n            Then cum_remainders[0]=0\n            i=1: A[0]=1 -> mod_A = 1 %2 =1 -> cum[1] = (0+1)%2 =1\n            i=2: A[1]=2 -> mod_A=0 -> cum[2]=(1+0)%2=1\n            i=3: A[2]=3 -> mod_A=1 -> cum[3]=(1+1)%2=0\n\n            Then cum_remainders = [0,1,1,0]\n\n            Sort: [0,0,1,1]\n\n            Then groups: \n                first group: 0,0 -> count=2 -> add 1\n                second group: 1,1 -> count=2 -> add 1 -> total=2.\n\n            Then output: 0 (because 2 !=0) -> so \"0\"\n\n        The first program: \n            combinations = 2 -> prints 2\n            Then second program: reads 2 -> prints 0\n            Then third program: reads \"0\" -> prints \"0\"\n\n        So our program outputs \"0\", which is correct.\n\n        Another test: \n            N=1, M=2, A=[2]\n            cum_remainders[0]=0\n            i=1: A[0]=2 -> mod_A=0 -> cum[1] = (0+0)%2=0\n            Then cum = [0,0] -> sorted [0,0]\n            total = 1 (from 0,0: 2 choose 2 = 1) -> then output 0? \n            But the first program: \n                combinations = 1 -> prints 1\n                second program: 1 !=0 -> prints 0\n                third: prints 0.\n\n            Our program: total=1 -> then output 0.\n\n        But what if we have no subarray? Actually, the cumulative array [0,0] gives one pair: (0,0) -> the subarray from index0 to index0? That's the empty subarray? Or from index0 to index1? \n\n        The first program: \n            It does: cum_remainders = [0, ...] and then counts pairs (i<j) such that cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[j]. \n            The subarray from i to j-1 is the one that sums to a multiple of M.\n\n            In our example: \n                cum = [0,0] -> the pairs: (0,1) -> the subarray from index0 to index1? But that corresponds to A[0:1] which is [2]. The sum is 2, which is divisible by 2. So one subarray.\n\n            Then the first program outputs 1.\n\n        So our program is correct.\n\n        Now, what if there are multiple remainders? \n\n        Example: N=2, M=3, A=[1,2]\n            cum_remainders[0]=0\n            i=1: 1 -> (0+1)%3=1\n            i=2: 2 -> (1+2)%3=0\n            Then cum = [0,1,0] -> sorted: [0,0,1]\n            Groups: [0,0] -> 1, [1] -> 1 -> total = 1 (from the zeros) + 0 (from the one) = 1.\n\n        The subarrays: \n            [1]: 1 %3 !=0\n            [2]: 2 %3 !=0\n            [1,2]: 3 %3=0 -> one subarray.\n\n        So total=1 -> output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the first program also counts the empty subarray? \n            The cumulative array includes 0 at the beginning. So the subarray from index0 to index0 (empty) has sum 0? \n            But the problem doesn't say if empty subarray is allowed. However, the problem says \"contiguous subarrays\", and typically contiguous subarrays include non-empty? \n\n        But the first program uses: \n            cum_remainders = (np.hstack([0, A]) % M).cumsum() % M\n\n        Then it counts pairs (i<j) of indices in the cumulative array. The cumulative array has length N+1. The pair (0,0) -> the empty subarray? \n\n        Example: N=0? but the problem says N and M are read, so N>=0? \n\n        The problem says: \"N, M = [int(x) for x in ...]\" -> so N>=0.\n\n        But the example: N=0: \n            Then A is empty? \n            Then cum_remainders = [0] -> then remainder_counts: {0:1} -> combinations = 0? \n\n        Then the entire chain outputs 1? \n\n        But what are the contiguous subarrays? \n            There is one contiguous subarray: the empty one? \n            Then the first program: \n                cum_remainders = [0] -> one element -> pairs: none? because we need two? \n                Actually, the program does: for each count in the Counter: count*(count-1)//2 -> 1*0//2=0.\n\n            Then the second program: 0 -> outputs 1.\n\n        So the empty array: one subarray? the empty one? Then why the count is 0? \n\n        Actually, the cumulative array has one element: 0. Then the pairs: we need two indices? But there is only one element. So no pair? \n\n        Therefore, the empty array is not counted? \n\n        But the cumulative array has the initial 0. Then the pair (0,0) is the same index? The program uses pairs with i<j. The indices are 0 and ... but only one element. So no pair.\n\n        Therefore, the first program does not count the empty subarray? \n\n        However, the cumulative array has two zeros? \n            For N=0: \n                A = []\n                cum_remainders = [0] -> only one element.\n\n            For N=1: \n                cum_remainders = [0, ...] -> two elements.\n\n        So the empty subarray would be represented by the pair (0,0) in the cumulative array? But if we have two zeros? \n\n        Actually, the cumulative array for the empty array is [0] (only one element). Then we have no pair. \n\n        But the problem: contiguous subarrays of an empty array? \n            The empty array has one contiguous subarray: the empty one? \n\n        How is it represented? \n            The cumulative array: \n                We have the initial 0. Then we have no elements to add. So the cumulative array is [0] (one element). \n            Then we have only one element -> no pair? \n\n        Therefore, the first program does not count the empty subarray? \n\n        However, the problem doesn't specify. We follow the first program.\n\n        Since the problem says: \"contiguous subarrays\", and typically they are non-empty? \n\n        But note: the first program uses:\n            cum_remainders = (np.hstack([0, A]) % M).cumsum() % M\n\n        Then it counts pairs (i<j) in the cumulative array. The cumulative array has length N+1. The number of pairs is C(n,2) for each remainder.\n\n        For the empty array: n=1 -> 0.\n\n        So the first program does not count the empty subarray? \n\n        But the cumulative array for the empty array: \n            The array A is empty. Then we have the initial 0. Then the cumulative array is [0]. \n            The contiguous subarray from index0 to index0? That would be the empty subarray? \n            But the cumulative array: the difference between cum_remainders[0] and cum_remainders[0] is 0? \n\n        How do we represent a contiguous subarray? \n            The contiguous subarray from i to j-1 is represented by the pair (i, j) in the cumulative array? \n            Then the empty subarray at position 0: i=0, j=0? Then the difference is cum_remainders[0] - cum_remainders[0] = 0? \n\n        But the program counts only pairs (i,j) with i<j? So i=0 and j=0 is not allowed? \n\n        Therefore, the empty subarray is not counted? \n\n        The problem: \"contiguous subarrays\" usually do not include the empty subarray? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n        Note: we assume that the array A might be large (N up to 10^5) and M up to 10^9.\n\n        We use long long for the cumulative array because the cumulative sum might be huge? But we are doing mod M? So the cumulative remainders are in [0, M-1] and M is at most 10^9? So we can use long long (which is 64-bit) to store the mod value? Yes, because 10^9 fits in int? But 10^9 is 1e9, which fits in int? Actually, int is at least 16 bits? In many systems, int is 32 bits (max 2e9) so 10^9 fits. But the mod value is in [0, M-1] and M is int, so we can store the mod value in an int? \n\n        However, the cumulative array: we are storing the mod value. But we are going to sort and count. The mod value is at most 10^9, which is within the range of int? But if M is 10^9, then the mod value can be up to 10^9-1, which is 999,999,999 -> fits in int? \n\n        But the problem says the array A is of type np.int64? So the elements are 64-bit. Then the cumulative sum (without mod) might be huge? But we do mod at every step? Then the mod value is an integer in [0, M-1] and M is int (which is 32-bit). So we can store the mod value in a long? But to be safe, we use long long? \n\n        Actually, we can store the mod value in a long long? It's safe.\n\n        But note: we are sorting an array of N+1 long long. That's 8*(N+1) bytes. For N=10^5, that's 800 KB, which is acceptable.\n\n        So we do as above.\n\n        However, we can optimize: we don't need to store the entire cumulative array? We can count the frequencies as we go? \n\n        But we need to sort? Alternatively, we can use a hash map? But we don't have one in C. So we sort.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire cumulative array? We can use an array of frequencies? But we cannot allocate an array of size M. So we use sorting.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code as below.\n\n        One more note: the cumulative remainders array: we are storing the mod values. But the mod value is in [0, M-1]. But M can be large (10^9) but we have only N+1 elements. So we can store and sort.\n\n        Code:\n\n        We include the necessary headers.\n\n        Note: we must be cautious for integer overflow in the combination count: \n            total_combinations += count*(count-1)/2\n\n        Here, count is at most N+1 (which is 10^5). Then count*(count-1) is about 10^10, which fits in long long? \n\n        We use long long for total_combinations and count.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            // Comparison function for qsort\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long x = *(const long long *)a;\n                long long y = *(const long long *)b;\n                if (x < y) return -1;\n                if (x > y) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n            int main() {\n                int N, M;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n                int *A = (int *)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n                }\n\n                // If N==0, then we have only one element in cum_remainders: 0.\n                long long *cum_remainders = (long long *)malloc((N+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                cum_remainders[0] = 0;\n\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    // Compute mod for A[i-1]\n                    long long mod_A = A[i-1] % M;\n                    if (mod_A < 0) {\n                        mod_A += M;\n                    }\n                    // Now, mod_A is non-negative and in [0, M-1]\n                    long long temp = cum_remainders[i-1] + mod_A;\n                    // Now compute mod for temp\n                    long long mod_temp = temp % M;\n                    if (mod_temp < 0) {\n                        mod_temp += M;\n                    }\n                    mod_temp %= M; // Ensure non-negative? Actually, we did add M if negative, but then mod_temp might be >= M? \n                    // Instead, we do: mod_temp = (temp % M + M) % M;\n                    mod_temp = temp % M;\n                    if (mod_temp < 0) {\n                        mod_temp += M;\n                    }\n                    mod_temp %= M; // This is redundant? But safe.\n                    cum_remainders[i] = mod_temp;\n                }\n\n                // Sort the cumulative remainders\n                qsort(cum_remainders, N+1, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n                // Count consecutive equal elements\n                long long total_combinations = 0;\n                long long count = 1; // at least one occurrence for the current value\n                for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                    if (cum_remainders[i] == cum_remainders[i-1]) {\n                        count++;\n                    } else {\n                        total_combinations += count * (count - 1) / 2;\n                        count = 1;\n                    }\n                }\n                total_combinations += count * (count - 1) / 2;\n\n                // Now, the second and third program: \n                if (total_combinations == 0) {\n                    printf(\"1\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"0\\n\");\n                }\n\n                free(A);\n                free(cum_remainders);\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        We test with the example N=0? \n            cum_remainders = [0] -> then the loop for i=1 to N (0 times) -> then we add the last group: count=1 -> total_combinations += 0 -> then output 1.\n\n        But the first program for N=0: \n            cum_remainders = [0] -> Counter({0:1}) -> total_combinations = 0 -> then output 1.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the mod_temp computation: we did two adjustments? We can do:\n\n            mod_temp = temp % M;\n            if (mod_temp < 0) mod_temp += M;\n            // Then mod_temp is in [0, M-1]? \n            // But then we do mod_temp %= M? That is redundant because mod_temp is already in [0, M-1). \n\n        So we can remove the last mod_temp %= M.\n\n        Revised:\n\n            mod_temp = temp % M;\n            if (mod_temp < 0) {\n                mod_temp += M;\n            }\n            // Now mod_temp is in [0, M-1]? \n            // But note: if temp is negative, then mod_temp becomes mod_temp + M, which is in [0, M-1]? \n            // Example: temp = -1, M=5 -> mod_temp = -1 %5 = -1? then add 5 -> 4 -> which is in [0,4]. Correct.\n\n            // If temp is positive: mod_temp is in [0, M-1]? \n            // Actually, the % operator for positive numbers: 7 % 5 = 2 -> non-negative and less than M.\n\n            // But what if temp is positive and mod_temp is 0? then we don't adjust.\n\n            // So we don't need the extra mod.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            mod_temp = temp % M;\n            if (mod_temp < 0) {\n                mod_temp += M;\n            }\n            cum_remainders[i] = mod_temp;\n\n        This is sufficient.\n\n        Final code:"
