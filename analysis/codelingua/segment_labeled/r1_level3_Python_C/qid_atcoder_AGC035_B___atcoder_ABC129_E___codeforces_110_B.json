  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Python programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program may print `-1` and exit if `M % 2 != 0`. In that case, the entire chain should output `-1` and stop. Otherwise, the first program prints a sequence of edges (each edge as two numbers) and then the second program runs on that output.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string (a line) as input. The output of the first program is multiple lines. We must capture the entire output of the first program and use it as the input for the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program reads a single line: `l = input()`. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program will only read the first line? That doesn't match the intended behavior.\n\nAlternatively, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (including all newlines) becomes the input to the second program. However, the second program only reads one line. This might cause a problem.\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads one line and processes it. But the first program outputs multiple lines (each edge as two numbers per line) and then the second program is expecting a binary string (like \"101\")? This seems inconsistent.\n\nBut note the third program: it expects an integer `n` and then prints a string of length `n`.\n\nWe must reconcile:\n\nFirst program: \n  Input: first line has N, M; then M lines of edges.\n  Output: either \"-1\" (if M is odd) or a sequence of M lines (each with two numbers) representing the directed edges.\n\nSecond program:\n  Input: a single line (a string of digits, but in the example the first program outputs numbers and newlines). \n\nThis mismatch indicates that the chain might not be designed to work together? However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut note: the first program might output `-1` and then exit. Then the second program would get the string \"-1\" as input. The second program then would process the string \"-1\", which is a string of two characters: ' - ' and '1'. Then the third program would get the output of the second program (a number) as an integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the first program outputs edges, then the second program would get the first line of that output (which is an edge) and use that as the string. Then the third program would get a number from the second program.\n\nThis does not seem to form a coherent chain.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are to run the three programs in sequence, and the entire output of the first is the entire input of the second, and the entire output of the second is the entire input of the third.\n\nBut the second program is designed to read a single line. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program would only read the first line? That is what the Python code does. But note: the second program uses `input()`, which reads one line. So the rest of the output from the first program would be lost? \n\nAlternatively, we must consider that the entire output of the first program is a string that may contain newlines, and that entire string is passed to the second program as its standard input. Then the second program's `input()` reads the first line of that string. The rest of the string remains in the input buffer? Actually, no: the second program only reads one line and ignores the rest? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We must be faithful to the behavior of the chain.\n\nAfter reevaluating, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So if the first program outputs 10 lines, the second program gets 10 lines as its input. However, the second program only reads one line. Then the third program would get the output of the second program (a single number) as a string? But the third program uses `input()` to read an integer. So it would read the single number.\n\nBut the second program outputs a number (with no newline? actually, the second program does `print(...)`, so it outputs a number and a newline). Then the third program would read that one integer.\n\nSo the chain is:\n\n1. First program: reads integers N, M and M edges. Outputs either:\n   a) \"-1\\n\" and exits, then the second program gets \"-1\\n\", then the second program runs and outputs a number (based on the string \"-1\"), then the third program gets that number as a string and tries to convert to integer? \n   or \n   b) M lines of edges (each line: two numbers and a newline). Then the second program reads the first line of that (which is the first edge) as a string? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis indicates that the programs are not intended to be chained arbitrarily. We must follow the specification: the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third.\n\nBut the first program's output is either:\n   Case 1: \"-1\\n\"\n   Case 2: M lines of two numbers each (each line: \"u v\\n\")\n\nThe second program expects a string of '0's and '1's? Actually, the second program is a DP for counting the number of ways to interpret a binary string with wildcards? But in our case, the first program outputs decimal numbers and spaces.\n\nThis is a problem. Unless the second program is designed to process the entire output of the first program? But it only reads one line.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and meant to be run on the same initial input? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nSo we have to simulate the chain:\n\n- The initial input (to the C program) is the same as the initial input to the first Python program: first line: N, M; then M lines of edges.\n\n- Then we run the first program. It may output \"-1\" and then we break the chain: the entire output of the C program should be \"-1\" (and then the second and third programs are skipped?).\n\nBut note: the chain must be as follows:\n\n   Step1: Run first program on the initial input. If it outputs \"-1\", then that is the final output? Or do we run the second and third on that? \n\n   The problem says: the entire sequence. So:\n\n      Input to the chain: the initial input.\n\n      Output of the chain: the output of the third program.\n\n      But if the first program outputs \"-1\", then the second program will run with input \"-1\", and then the third program will run with the output of the second.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must run the three programs in sequence regardless.\n\nBut the second program might crash if the input is not a string of '0' and '1'? Actually, the second program only has two cases: if the character is '0' or not. For the string \"-1\", the first character is '-' and the second is '1'. So:\n\n   For the string \"-1\":\n      n = 2.\n      dp[0][0] = 1.\n      i=0, c='-': which is not '0', so we do:\n          dp[1][0] += dp[0][0]*2 -> 2\n          dp[1][1] += dp[0][0] -> 1\n          dp[1][1] += dp[0][1]*3 -> 1 (since dp[0][1] is 0)\n          then mod: dp[1][0]=2, dp[1][1]=1.\n      i=1, c='1': not '0'\n          dp[2][0] += dp[1][0]*2 -> 4\n          dp[2][1] += dp[1][0] -> 2\n          dp[2][1] += dp[1][1]*3 -> 1*3=3 -> total 5\n          mod: 4 and 5 -> 4 and 5 mod mod.\n      Then output: (4+5) % mod = 9.\n\n   Then the third program gets the string \"9\" (because the second program outputs 9 and a newline). Then the third program does:\n        n = int(input())   -> n = 9\n        then prints a string of 9 characters: \"abcdabcda\"\n\nBut the original first program output -1 and then the chain continues? The problem does not say to break the chain on -1. The first program prints -1 and then exits, but the next programs still run.\n\nSo the entire chain must run regardless of the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, we have to design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (N, M and M edges).\n   Step 2: Run the logic of the first program, capturing its output (which might be either \"-1\\n\" or M lines of edges) in a string (without actually printing it, because we are in the middle of the chain).\n   Step 3: Then use that entire string as the input to the second program (which is a DP that processes a string of characters one by one).\n   Step 4: Then capture the output of the second program (a number) and use that as the input to the third program (which expects an integer n and then prints a string of length n).\n\nBut note: the third program's output is the final output.\n\nHowever, the first program might output multiple lines. We must capture the entire output (with newlines) as a single string to feed to the second program. But the second program only reads one line? Actually, the second program uses `input()` which reads one line. So the entire output of the first program is multiple lines, but the second program only uses the first line? Then the rest of the lines are lost? \n\nBut that is the behavior of the chain: the second program only reads the first line of the first program's output. The rest of the lines are ignored. Then the third program reads the second program's output (which is one integer) and uses that.\n\nSo we must simulate:\n\n   - The first program produces a string S (which may be multiple lines).\n   - The second program reads the first line of S (i.e., up to the first newline) and processes that string (which we call `l`).\n   - The third program reads the entire output of the second program (which is one integer) and uses that as `n`.\n\nBut wait: the second program outputs a number and a newline? Then the third program will read that number as the first line.\n\nTherefore, the chain:\n\n   First program output: S (with newlines)\n   Second program input: first line of S (without the newline? because `input()` strips the newline? Actually, in Python, `input()` returns a string without the trailing newline. But the second program does not use the entire S, only the first line.\n\n   Then the second program outputs a number (with a newline) which becomes the input to the third program. The third program reads that entire output (one integer) and then prints a string of that length.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs multiple lines? The second program only uses the first line. The rest of the lines are not consumed? Then the third program would try to read from the next line? But the third program only reads one integer. And the input to the third program is the entire output of the second program (which is one line). So there is no leftover.\n\nActually, the chain is:\n\n   The input to the second program is the entire output of the first program (as a single string). Then the second program's `input()` reads the first line of that string. The rest of the string is still in the buffer? But the second program doesn't read more. Then the third program gets the entire output of the second program (a string) as its input. So the third program's `input()` reads that entire string (which is one integer) and ignores the rest of the first program's output? \n\nBut that rest is not passed to the third program. The chain is:\n\n   First program output -> becomes the input of the second program (so the second program's stdin is set to that string).\n   Second program runs: reads one line from its stdin (which is the first line of the first program's output).\n   Then the second program writes to its stdout (which is then captured and becomes the input of the third program).\n\nSo the third program's stdin is the string that the second program wrote (which is one integer and a newline). The rest of the first program's output (if any) is not seen by the third program.\n\nTherefore, we must:\n\n   In C, we simulate:\n\n      Step 1: Read the initial input (N, M and M edges) from stdin.\n\n      Step 2: Run the first program's logic. But instead of printing, we capture what would be printed:\n\n          - If M is odd, we capture the string \"-1\\n\".\n          - Else, we capture M lines (each line: two numbers and a newline). Note: the numbers are printed as (u+1, v+1) or (v+1, u+1) in the original.\n\n      Step 3: Then we extract the first line from the captured output (for the second program). But note: the second program only uses the first line. However, if the first program output \"-1\", then we have the string \"-1\\n\", so the first line is \"-1\" (without the newline? actually we will simulate the input for the second program: we will set a string that is the entire first program output. Then we will read the first line from that string for the second program.\n\n      But the second program does not see the entire string? It only sees the first line? Actually, we can simulate by:\n\n          - For the second program, we are given a string (the entire first program output). We only use the first line (i.e., up to the first newline) and ignore the rest? But note: the second program does not read the rest. So we can extract the first line and then run the DP on that line.\n\n      Step 4: Then the second program outputs a number (mod 10^9+7) and we capture that as a string (with a newline) to pass to the third program.\n\n      Step 5: The third program then reads that string (which is one integer) and then outputs a string of length n (which is the integer) by cycling \"abcd\".\n\nHowever, note: the third program uses `input()` to read an integer. So we must convert the string we captured (the output of the second program) to an integer. Then we output a string of that length.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire chain must be in one C program without I/O in the middle. So we must avoid actual I/O and use buffers.\n\nWe'll design:\n\n   We read the initial input (from stdin) and store:\n\n        int N, M;\n        int edges[?][?]   ... but we don't know the maximum size.\n\n   We must assume worst-case sizes? The problem does not specify constraints. But in the first program, we have N nodes and M edges.\n\n   We'll assume:\n\n        N, M up to 100000? \n\n   How to store edges? The first program uses:\n\n        edges = [set() for _ in range(N)]\n\n   We can use an array of dynamic arrays? But in C we can use adjacency lists with linked lists or arrays.\n\n   However, the first program also uses a priority queue (heap) and degs array.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read N, M.\n        If M is odd: then we set a flag and capture the output string as \"-1\\n\".\n        Else: we simulate the graph algorithm and capture M lines of output (each line: two numbers and a newline).\n\n        Then, for the second program:\n\n            We take the first line of the captured output (from the first program) and remove the newline? Actually, we want the string without the newline? Because the second program's `input()` returns the line without the newline.\n\n            But note: the second program does:\n\n                l = input()   -> a string without the trailing newline.\n\n            Then we run the DP on that string.\n\n        Then, we compute the result of the second program: (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % mod, and then we format that number as a string (with a newline) for the next program.\n\n        Then, the third program:\n\n            We take the entire output of the second program (a string) and convert it to an integer n.\n\n            Then we generate a string of length n: by repeating \"abcd\" as needed.\n\n        Then we output that string.\n\nBut note: what if the first program outputs multiple lines? The second program only uses the first line. The rest are ignored. So we only need the first line of the first program's output for the second program.\n\nHowever, what if the first program outputs \"-1\\n\"? Then the first line is \"-1\". The second program will process the string \"-1\". Then the third program will get the number (which is 9) and output a string of length 9.\n\nBut the original chain: the first program outputs \"-1\" and then exits. The second program runs and outputs 9. The third program runs and outputs \"abcdabcda\". So the entire chain outputs \"abcdabcda\".\n\nBut the original first program output \"-1\", so the entire chain output is not -1? It is transformed.\n\nTherefore, we must follow the chain.\n\nImplementation challenges:\n\n  1. We must capture the output of the first program without actually printing it. We'll store:\n\n        char *first_program_output;   // dynamically allocated string\n\n        How to build? We can use a string buffer.\n\n        If M is odd: we write \" -1\\n\" (but note: the original prints \"-1\" and then a newline? because `print(-1)` -> prints \"-1\\n\".\n\n        Else: we simulate the algorithm and for each edge we print, we write a line to the buffer.\n\n  2. Then we extract the first line from that buffer.\n\n        We find the first newline and then take the substring from the beginning to the newline (excluding the newline) for the second program.\n\n  3. Then we run the second program on that string.\n\n  4. Then we take the result (an integer) and format it as a string (with a newline) for the third program.\n\n        But note: the third program uses `input()`, which reads the entire line (and then converts to integer). So we must pass the entire output of the second program (which is one integer and a newline) as the input to the third program. However, the third program only uses the integer. So we can just convert the integer we got to an integer variable and then ignore the string representation? \n\n        Actually, the third program:\n\n            n = int(input())\n\n        So we take the entire string that the second program output and convert it to an integer. But note: the second program outputs a number and a newline. The third program's `input()` reads the entire line (which is the number and the newline? but `input()` in Python would strip the newline and then convert the string to integer). So we can do:\n\n            s = output of second program (a string) -> we can use atoi? But the string has a newline? Actually, we built the string: we know the integer and we can just use that integer.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire chain. We must simulate the input to the third program. But since the third program only reads one integer, we can take the integer result of the second program and use that as n.\n\n  5. Then the third program outputs a string of n characters.\n\nBut note: the third program outputs without a newline? Actually, it does `print(s)`, which adds a newline. So we must output the string and then a newline.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify whether the output should have a trailing newline. But the original Python programs do.\n\nTherefore, we design:\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Read N, M and M edges.\n\n      // First program\n      if (M % 2 != 0) {\n          // We set a buffer for the first program output: \"-1\\n\"\n          // Then for the second program, we take the first line (which is \"-1\") -> without the newline? but note: the string is \"-1\\n\", so the first line is the string \" -1\" (without the newline) is the content for the second program's input.\n      } else {\n          // Build graph: edges, degs, etc.\n          // Then simulate the heap and the removal, and for each edge we print, we write to a buffer: we need to write M lines.\n          // Format: for each edge, we write either (u+1) and (v+1) or (v+1) and (u+1) and then a newline.\n      }\n\n      // Then extract the first line from the first program's output buffer.\n\n      // Second program: \n          string = the first line we extracted (without the newline? but we stored the entire buffer and then we can extract the first line without the newline).\n          n2 = length of that string.\n          dp[0][0] = 1, the rest 0.\n          for each character in the string:\n              if char == '0':\n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i][0]) % mod\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][1] * 3) % mod\n              else:\n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i][0] * 2) % mod\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1] * 3) % mod   // note: the original does two steps: first adds dp[i][0] and then adds dp[i][1]*3, then mod.\n          result = (dp[n2][0] + dp[n2][1]) % mod\n\n      // Then, the third program:\n          n3 = result   ??? But note: the third program gets the output of the second program as a string. The second program outputs the integer `result` as a string (with a newline). Then the third program reads that string and converts to integer. But the string might have a newline? Actually, the third program's input is the entire output of the second program. We can convert the integer `result` to a string and then the third program would read that string and convert back to integer? \n\n          However, we have the integer `result` already. We can just use that integer as the n for the third program.\n\n          But note: the second program outputs the number and then a newline. The third program's `input()` reads the entire line and then converts to integer. The newline is just a separator and is not part of the number. So the integer value is `result`. Therefore, we can set:\n\n              n3 = result;\n\n          Then the third program outputs a string of length n3: by repeating \"abcd\" for n3 characters, and then a newline.\n\n      However, what if the second program outputs a number that is too large? The third program expects an integer n, but the second program's result is modulo 10^9+7. So n3 is between 0 and 10^9+6. We then output a string of length n3? That might be very long (10^9 characters) and we cannot output that in C.\n\n      But note: the original third program in Python:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = \"\"\n          for i in range(n):\n              s += LUCKY[i % 4]\n\n          Then prints s.\n\n      We cannot build a string of 10^9 characters in memory. We must output without building the entire string.\n\n      How? We can output in chunks. But note: we are in C, and we can output character by character. We can do:\n\n          for (i = 0; i < n3; i++) {\n              putchar(\"abcd\"[i % 4]);\n          }\n          putchar('\\n');\n\n      But 10^9 iterations might be too slow? We are in C and 1e9 iterations might take about 1 second? But worst-case 10^9 iterations is acceptable in C? It might be borderline in some online judges, but we have to do it.\n\n      Alternatively, we can break it into chunks: write the pattern \"abcd\" repeatedly for n3/4 times and then the remainder. But the problem does not specify constraints on n3. However, n3 is at most 10^9, so we cannot build a string that long. We must output without building.\n\n      Therefore, we do:\n\n          for (i = 0; i < n3; i++) {\n              putchar(\"abcd\"[i % 4]);\n          }\n          putchar('\\n');\n\n      But note: the original program builds the string and then prints. We are simulating the same output.\n\n      However, if the first program output \"-1\", then the second program gets the string \"-1\" (without the newline) and then outputs 9. Then the third program outputs \"abcdabcda\" (9 characters) and a newline.\n\n      So the entire chain output is \"abcdabcda\\n\".\n\n      But the original first program would have output \"-1\\n\", then the second program outputs \"9\\n\", then the third program outputs \"abcdabcda\\n\". So the entire output is:\n\n          \"-1\\n9\\nabcdabcda\\n\"\n\n      But wait: the chain output is the output of the third program? Or the entire output of the chain? The problem says: the entire sequence. The output of the chain is the output of the last program. The problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we only output what the third program outputs.\n\n      Therefore, we should only output the string of the third program (which is the string of length n3 and a newline). The intermediate outputs are not printed? \n\n      But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\"\n\n      So we are not to output the intermediate results. We are to output only the final result.\n\n      However, the original chain would have printed:\n\n          First program: either \"-1\\n\" or M lines.\n          Second program: one integer and a newline.\n          Third program: a string and a newline.\n\n      And the entire output to stdout would be the concatenation.\n\n      But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that in the C program, we should not print until the very end. Therefore, we must capture all intermediate outputs and then only output the final result? \n\n      But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The entire chain produces a sequence of outputs. The final C program should produce the same output as the entire chain when run on the same input.\n\n      Therefore, we must output:\n\n          first_program_output + second_program_output + third_program_output\n\n      But wait: the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" This seems contradictory.\n\n      After re-reading: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning:\n\n          - We read all input at the beginning (from stdin) in the first block.\n          - We write the final output at the end (to stdout) in the last block.\n\n      But the entire chain produces output in three stages. The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning the same total output.\n\n      How to reconcile? We are to simulate the chain without intermediate I/O. We capture the intermediate outputs in memory and then at the end, we output the entire concatenated output? \n\n      But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we only output at the very end. And the output should be the same as the entire chain.\n\n      Therefore, we must build a buffer for the entire output of the chain and then output it at the end.\n\n      But the total output might be huge: if the first program outputs M lines (each edge) and M can be 100000, that's 100000 lines (about 700000 characters). Then the second program outputs one integer (up to 9 digits). Then the third program outputs a string of length n3 (which can be up to 10^9 characters). We cannot buffer 10^9 characters in memory.\n\n      Therefore, we must output the third program's output without buffering? But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can only output at the end. So we must buffer the entire output.\n\n      Alternatively, we can break the rules? \n\n      After re-examining: the problem says \"without I/O\" in the middle. So we are not to use printf/scanf in the middle. But the last block can output the entire chain output. However, the entire chain output is the concatenation of:\n\n          first_program_output + second_program_output + third_program_output\n\n      And we are not allowed to output until the last block. But the third program output might be huge. We cannot buffer it.\n\n      Therefore, we must reconsider: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" meaning that we should not use any I/O during the intermediate steps. But the final output of the entire chain might be huge. We are allowed to output at the end without buffering by generating the third program's output on the fly? \n\n      However, the third program's output is generated by a loop. We can do:\n\n          // We have the entire output of the first and second programs buffered.\n          // Then we output the entire first program output (if any) and the entire second program output (if any) and then generate the third program output without buffering.\n\n      But note: the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". The original chain outputs the first program output immediately, then the second, then the third. But we are in one C program: we can output the first program output first, then the second, then the third? That would be the same as the chain.\n\n      However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we are not to use printf in the middle of the code. We must do all output at the end.\n\n      But then how to output 10^9 characters at the end without precomputation? We can do:\n\n          // First, we compute the entire output of the first program and store in a string buffer1.\n          // Then, we compute the entire output of the second program and store in a string buffer2.\n          // Then, we compute the integer n3 for the third program.\n          // Then, we output buffer1, then buffer2, and then we output the string for the third program by looping.\n\n      But note: the third program's output is not stored in a buffer, we output it by a loop.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can have a block at the end that does:\n\n          fwrite(buffer1, ...);\n          fwrite(buffer2, ...);\n          for (i=0; i<n3; i++) { ... }\n\n      This is acceptable if we don't mind that the entire output is at the end.\n\n      But the original chain does:\n\n          first program: outputs immediately.\n          second program: starts only after the first finishes, and outputs immediately after.\n          third program: same.\n\n      The user would see the output in three parts. But if we buffer the first two and then output at the end, it is the same total output.\n\n      However, if the first program outputs a lot and then the second program outputs a little, and the third program outputs a huge amount, we must buffer the first two. The first two might be manageable (a few MB) but the third might be GB. But the problem doesn't specify constraints on n3. We must assume n3 can be large.\n\n      But note: the second program's output is an integer mod 10^9+7, so it is at most 10^9, so the string representation has at most 10 digits. So buffer2 is small.\n\n      The first program output: M lines, each line has two numbers (each number up to 100000, so 6 digits) -> each line about 12-13 characters, so total about 1.3e6 characters for M=100000. That is 1.3 MB. So we can buffer that.\n\n      Then the third program output: n3 can be up to 10^9, which is 10^9 bytes -> 1 GB. We cannot buffer that. We must output without buffering.\n\n      Therefore, we design:\n\n          Step 1: Read input and run first program, capturing output in a buffer (char *first_out) and also we remember its length.\n\n          Step 2: Extract the first line from first_out for the second program. Run the second program to get an integer result.\n\n          Step 3: Now, we are ready to output the entire chain output.\n\n          We output the entire first_out (which is the first program output) to stdout.\n          Then we output the second program output: we know the integer result, so we printf(\"%d\\n\", result);   -> but note: we are in the last block? We are about to output the third program output.\n\n          Actually, we are allowed to output only at the very end. But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can have one contiguous block of code that does all the output. We can do:\n\n              // Output the first program output\n              fwrite(first_out, 1, first_out_len, stdout);\n\n              // Output the second program output: which is the integer and a newline.\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", result);   // but note: we are in the last block? How can we do multiple outputs?\n\n          But the last block is the entire output section. We can output in multiple steps as long as we do it in one contiguous block at the end.\n\n          However, the third program output is huge and we must avoid buffering. We can do:\n\n              // Output the first program output\n              write(1, first_out, first_out_len);\n\n              // Output the second program output as a string\n              char buf[20];\n              int len2 = sprintf(buf, \"%d\\n\", result);\n              write(1, buf, len2);\n\n              // Output the third program output: a string of length n3 (which is the integer we got) and a newline? \n              // But wait: the third program only outputs the string and then a newline? The original: print(s) -> outputs the string and a newline.\n\n          So we must output a string of length n3 and then a newline.\n\n          How to output a string of length n3 (which might be 10^9) without buffering? We can loop:\n\n              for (i=0; i<n3; i++) {\n                  putchar(\"abcd\"[i % 4]);\n              }\n              putchar('\\n');\n\n          But 10^9 iterations might be slow? We must optimize.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              const char *pattern = \"abcd\";\n              int i;\n              // We break into chunks: write in blocks of 4.\n              int full_blocks = n3 / 4;\n              int rem = n3 % 4;\n              for (i = 0; i < full_blocks; i++) {\n                  fwrite(pattern, 1, 4, stdout);\n              }\n              if (rem) {\n                  fwrite(pattern, 1, rem, stdout);\n              }\n              putchar('\\n');\n\n          This is faster.\n\n      But note: the third program's output is the string and then a newline. So we output the string and then a newline.\n\n      Therefore, we do:\n\n          Step 1: Read input and run first program, capturing its output in a buffer (if M is odd, then first_out = \"-1\\n\", first_out_len=4; else, we build the buffer with M lines).\n\n          Step 2: Extract the first line from first_out: we need to find the first newline. We'll create a string for the second program:\n\n              char *second_in = first_out;   // but we want to stop at the first newline.\n              // We can compute the length of the first line: \n              int len_first_line = 0;\n              while (first_out[len_first_line] != '\\n' && len_first_line < first_out_len) {\n                  len_first_line++;\n              }\n              // Then we have a string of length `len_first_line` at first_out.\n\n          Step 3: Run the second program on the string (first_out, len_first_line). We simulate the DP.\n\n          Step 4: Compute n3 = (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % mod.\n\n          Step 5: Output the entire chain output:\n\n              // First program output: we output the entire first_out (which includes the first line and the rest of the lines and the newline at the end of the first line and the rest) if any.\n              fwrite(first_out, 1, first_out_len, stdout);\n\n              // Second program output: we output the integer n3 and a newline.\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", n3);   // note: we are using stdout, and we haven't output the third program's output yet. But stdout is buffered? We can do:\n\n              // Third program output: a string of length n3 and then a newline.\n              // But note: the third program output is appended to the second program output? \n              // The entire chain output is: first_out, then the second program output (which is the integer and a newline), then the third program output (the string and a newline).\n\n          However, the third program output is the last thing.\n\n          But the problem says: the output of the first program is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third. The final output to stdout is the concatenation of all three outputs.\n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n              write(1, first_out, first_out_len);\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", n3);\n              // Then output the pattern string of length n3 and then a newline.\n\n          But note: the third program output is the string and a newline. So:\n\n              output_pattern(n3);   // which outputs the pattern and then we output a newline? Actually, the pattern is printed and then a newline.\n\n          However, the original third program does:\n\n              print(s)   -> which is the string s and then a newline.\n\n          So we output the pattern of length n3 and then a newline.\n\n      But wait: what if the first program output \"-1\\n\", then the second program output \"9\\n\", then the third program output \"abcdabcda\\n\". The entire output is:\n\n          \"-1\\n9\\nabcdabcda\\n\"\n\n      This is 4 + 2 + 10 = 16 bytes? \n\n          \"-1\\n\" -> 3 bytes? (because '-' '1' and newline) -> 3 bytes.\n          \"9\\n\" -> 2 bytes.\n          \"abcdabcda\\n\" -> 9+1 = 10 bytes.\n\n          Total: 3+2+10 = 15 bytes.\n\n      But note: the first_out for \"-1\" is 3 bytes? because we built it as \"-1\\n\", which is 3 characters? Actually, the string \"-1\\n\" is 3 characters? No: \n          '-' , '1', '\\n' -> 3 characters? But the newline is one character.\n\n      So:\n\n          first_out = \"-1\\n\" -> 3 bytes.\n\n          Then we output 3 bytes.\n\n          Then we output \"9\\n\" -> 2 bytes.\n\n          Then we output \"abcdabcda\\n\" -> 10 bytes.\n\n          Total: 3+2+10 = 15.\n\n      But the expected output? The original chain:\n\n          First program: outputs \"-1\\n\" (3 bytes)\n          Second program: outputs \"9\\n\" (2 bytes)\n          Third program: outputs \"abcdabcda\\n\" (10 bytes)\n\n          So the entire stdout would be 15 bytes.\n\n      Therefore, we do:\n\n          // Output the first program output: which is first_out (of length first_out_len)\n          fwrite(first_out, 1, first_out_len, stdout);\n\n          // Output the second program output: the integer n3 and a newline.\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", n3);   // note: this outputs the integer and a newline.\n\n          // Output the third program output: a string of length n3 (without a newline? no, we also output a newline at the end) but wait: the third program outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n          output_pattern(n3);   // which outputs n3 characters and then a newline.\n\n      However, the function output_pattern should be:\n\n          void output_pattern(int n) {\n              const char pattern[] = \"abcd\";\n              int i;\n              int full = n / 4;\n              int rem = n % 4;\n              for (i = 0; i < full; i++) {\n                  printf(\"%s\", pattern);   // or fwrite for efficiency\n              }\n              if (rem) {\n                  printf(\"%.*s\", rem, pattern);\n              }\n              printf(\"\\n\");\n          }\n\n      But this uses printf and might be inefficient for large n. We can use fwrite for the full blocks.\n\n          void output_pattern(int n) {\n              const char pattern[] = \"abcd\";\n              int full = n / 4;\n              int rem = n % 4;\n              for (int i = 0; i < full; i++) {\n                  fwrite(pattern, 1, 4, stdout);\n              }\n              if (rem) {\n                  fwrite(pattern, 1, rem, stdout);\n              }\n              fwrite(\"\\n\", 1, 1, stdout);\n          }\n\n      But note: the third program's output is the string and then a newline, so we output the string of length n and then a newline.\n\n      However, the second program output already had a newline at the end. So the entire output has:\n\n          first_out (which ends with a newline if M is odd, or if M is even then the last line has a newline) \n          then the second program output (which is a number and a newline)\n          then the third program output (which is a string and a newline)\n\n      This is as expected.\n\n   But what if M is even? Then the first program outputs M lines, each line has two numbers and a newline. The entire first_out ends with a newline. Then we output the second program output (a number and a newline) and then the third program output.\n\n   This is fine.\n\n   However, note: the second program only uses the first line of the first_out. The rest of the lines in the first_out are still output by us in the first fwrite. This matches the original chain: the first program outputs all the edges, and then the second program outputs a number, and then the third program outputs a string.\n\n   Therefore, we design:\n\n        Step 1: Read input.\n\n        Step 2: If M is odd, then \n                    first_out = \"-1\\n\"\n                    first_out_len = 3   [because '-', '1', '\\n']\n                Else:\n                    Build graph (with N, M, edges)\n                    Run the heap algorithm and capture the output in a buffer (we'll build a string for first_out)\n\n        Step 3: Extract the first line from first_out (for the second program). How? We need to copy the first line (without the newline) to a separate buffer? Or we can just scan in place.\n\n        Step 4: Run the second program on the first line (a string of length L) to compute n3.\n\n        Step 5: Output the entire chain:\n\n            fwrite(first_out, 1, first_out_len, stdout);\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", n3);\n            output_pattern(n3);   // which outputs a string of length n3 and a newline.\n\n   But note: the third program uses the output of the second program as its input. The second program output is the integer n3 and a newline. The third program then uses that to determine n. But we are not using the string representation of n3 to feed to the third program? We are using the integer value. That is acceptable because the integer value is n3.\n\n   However, what if the second program output has a formatting issue? For example, if we use printf(\"%d\\n\", n3) and n3 is 10, then the output is \"10\\n\". The third program would read the string \"10\" (without the newline? because input() in Python strips the newline) and then convert to integer 10. But in our simulation, we are using the integer n3 directly. So it is the same.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\nImplementation details for the first program when M is even:\n\n   We are given:\n\n        N, M\n        M edges: each edge (a, b)\n\n   We need to build:\n\n        edges: an array of sets for each node. But in C we can use an array of dynamic arrays? But the program removes edges. We need to efficiently remove an edge.\n\n   However, note: the original uses sets. We can use linked lists for adjacency lists? But removal from a linked list is O(1) if we have the pointer? But we don't.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an array of arrays and mark edges as removed? But the program:\n\n        edges[u] = set of neighbors.\n\n        For an edge (u, v):\n\n            edges[u].remove(v)\n\n        and then we remove (v, u) as well? Actually, the graph is undirected.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        We'll store for each node, a dynamic array (we'll use a linked list) but removal in a linked list is O(deg). The total complexity would be O(M * deg) which might be O(N*M) worst-case.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an array of sets? In C we don't have sets. We can use a hash table per node? But M and N up to 100000, and we are not allowed to use C++.\n\n   We can use a global array for the graph? And then we mark edges as deleted.\n\n        How? We can store:\n\n            int *adj[MAX_N];   // pointers to arrays of neighbors?\n            int deg[MAX_N];     // current degree (after removals)\n\n        But the algorithm:\n\n            We start with degs[i] = degree of node i.\n\n            We have a min-heap (priority queue) of (deg, node).\n\n            Then we pop the smallest degree node. If it is flagged, skip. Then we set flag[u]=True.\n\n            Then we iterate over the edges of u: for each neighbor v in edges[u] (but we are going to remove the edge (u,v)).\n\n            Then we remove the edge (u,v) from edges[v] as well.\n\n            Then we decide the direction: if (parity[u] != 0 and i==0) then we print (u+1, v+1) and flip parity[u]. Otherwise, we print (v+1, u+1) and flip parity[v].\n\n            Then we decrease degs[v] by 1 and push (degs[v], v) into the heap.\n\n        How to iterate over edges[u]? And how to remove an edge (u,v) from edges[v]?\n\n        We can store for each node an array of neighbors and then mark the edge as removed? But we need to avoid iterating over removed edges.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use linked lists with pointers to the next and previous. We can use:\n\n            struct Node {\n                int value;\n                struct Node *next;\n                struct Node *prev;\n            };\n\n            But then we need to remove a specific node.\n\n        Or we can use an array of dynamic arrays and then use a \"deleted\" marker per edge? But the edge is represented by the neighbor index.\n\n        We can store:\n\n            We'll have for each node u, a doubly linked list of its neighbors.\n\n            We also store for each edge (u,v) a pointer to the node in u's list that represents v, and similarly in v's list for u? Then we can remove in O(1).\n\n        However, the original code:\n\n            for i, v in enumerate(edges[u]):\n\n            It iterates over the set. Then it removes the edge (u,v) from edges[v]. And then it uses the index i: if i==0 and parity[u]!=0 then ... \n\n        But note: the set is unordered. The original code uses a set and then iterates arbitrarily? But it uses `enumerate` and then uses the index i. The condition is: if i==0 and parity[u]!=0.\n\n        This is non-deterministic? But the set in Python is unordered. So the output might be arbitrary? However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". But the original is non-deterministic? \n\n        Actually, the set in Python is unordered, but the iteration order might be arbitrary. We don't have to match the order exactly? The problem does not specify the order.\n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\" meaning the same output for the same input. But the original might produce different outputs on different runs? \n\n        However, we must match the behavior. We can use any order? \n\n        But note: the condition uses `i==0` (the first neighbor in the iteration). So we must choose an arbitrary neighbor? \n\n        We can choose the smallest neighbor? Or the largest? Or any? The original set in Python might be arbitrary. We can use an arbitrary one? But we need to remove one edge. The algorithm is:\n\n            We remove an edge from u to v, and then we direct the edge.\n\n        We can choose the first neighbor in an arbitrary order. How about we store the neighbors in a linked list and then always take the first one? \n\n        Then we remove it. Then we remove the reverse edge from v's list.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            We maintain for each node u:\n\n                a linked list of neighbors that are still present.\n\n                We also store the current degree (which is the length of the list).\n\n            We have a min-heap: the heap will contain (current_degree, node_index). We use a priority queue (min-heap).\n\n            We have an array flag[] to mark removed nodes.\n\n            We have an array parity[].\n\n            We also have an array for the linked list heads: struct Node *adj[MAX_N];\n\n            How to remove from a linked list? We have to remove a specific node (which is the node representing u in v's list, and v in u's list). \n\n            But when we are at node u, we take the first neighbor from u's list? That would be arbitrary? Actually, the linked list order is arbitrary.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                v = u->head->value;   // we take the first neighbor in the linked list.\n\n            Then we remove the node from u's list.\n\n            Then we also remove the node representing u from v's list. How do we find that node? \n\n                We can store for each edge (u,v) a pointer to the node in u's list and in v's list? \n\n            Alternatively, we can store the linked list with a hash table mapping from neighbor to the node? But we are in C and we don't have hash tables.\n\n            We can store:\n\n                struct Node {\n                    int neighbor;\n                    struct Node *next;\n                    struct Node *prev;\n                    struct Node *reverse;   // pointer to the node in the neighbor's list that points back to u\n                };\n\n            Then when we remove the node for (u,v) in u's list, we can remove the reverse node in v's list.\n\n            But this requires extra memory.\n\n        However, we note: the original code does:\n\n            edges[v].remove(u)\n\n            and we know the exact neighbor u to remove from v's list.\n\n            So we can store for each node a balanced BST? But we don't have one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an array of sets implemented as hash tables? But we are in C.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the constraints (N, M up to 100000), we can use an array of linked lists and then when we remove an edge (u,v) from v's list, we traverse the list to find the node with neighbor u? That would be O(deg(v)). The total complexity would be O(M * deg) which might be O(M * N) worst-case (if we have a star graph, then the center node has degree M, and then each removal from the center node would take O(M)). Total M removals: O(M^2) which is 10e10 for M=100000 -> too slow.\n\n        We need a faster removal.\n\n        We can store:\n\n            For each node u, we store a doubly linked list of its neighbors.\n\n            Additionally, we store an array (or a hash table) that maps from neighbor v to the node in u's list that represents v.\n\n            We can use an array of arrays? But the array would be of size [MAX_N][MAX_N] -> too big.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            struct AdjNode {\n                int v;   // neighbor\n                struct AdjNode *next;\n                struct AdjNode *prev;\n            };\n\n            struct AdjList {\n                struct AdjNode *head;\n                int size;\n            } adj[MAX_N];\n\n            And then we also store for each edge (u,v) and (v,u) we have two nodes. How to connect them? \n\n            We can store:\n\n                struct Edge {\n                    int u, v;\n                    struct AdjNode *node_uv;   // node in u's list for v\n                    struct AdjNode *node_vu;   // node in v's list for u\n                };\n\n            But we don't have a global edge list. And we are given M edges.\n\n            Alternatively, when we add an edge (u,v):\n\n                We create two nodes:\n\n                    node_uv = (struct AdjNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct AdjNode));\n                    node_uv->v = v;\n                    insert into u's list.\n\n                    node_vu = (struct AdjNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct AdjNode));\n                    node_vu->v = u;\n                    insert into v's list.\n\n                And then we set node_uv->reverse = node_vu;\n                node_vu->reverse = node_uv;\n\n            Then when we remove the edge (u,v) from u's list, we also remove the reverse edge by:\n\n                remove node_uv from u's list: \n                    if (node_uv->prev) node_uv->prev->next = node_uv->next;\n                    else adj[u].head = node_uv->next;\n                    if (node_uv->next) node_uv->next->prev = node_uv->prev;\n\n                Then we remove node_vu from v's list similarly.\n\n            Then we free the nodes.\n\n        This is O(1) per removal.\n\n        Steps for the first program when M is even:\n\n            Precomputation:\n\n                Read N, M.\n\n                adj = array of AdjList of size N, initialized to NULL and size=0.\n                degs = array of int, initialized to 0.\n                parity = array of int, initialized to 0.\n                flag = array of bool, initialized to false.\n\n                We'll also have a min-heap (priority queue) implemented as a binary heap.\n\n            For each edge (a,b) (0-indexed nodes: a-1, b-1):\n\n                u = a-1, v = b-1.\n\n                // create node_uv for u->v\n                struct AdjNode *node_uv = (struct AdjNode*)malloc(...);\n                node_uv->v = v;\n                // create node_vu for v->u\n                struct AdjNode *node_vu = (struct AdjNode*)malloc(...);\n                node_vu->v = u;\n\n                // link them\n                node_uv->reverse = node_vu;\n                node_vu->reverse = node_uv;\n\n                // insert node_uv into u's list (at the front? for O(1))\n                node_uv->next = adj[u].head;\n                node_uv->prev = NULL;\n                if (adj[u].head) adj[u].head->prev = node_uv;\n                adj[u].head = node_uv;\n                adj[u].size++;\n\n                // similarly for v\n                node_vu->next = adj[v].head;\n                node_vu->prev = NULL;\n                if (adj[v].head) adj[v].head->prev = node_vu;\n                adj[v].head = node_vu;\n                adj[v].size++;\n\n                degs[u] = adj[u].size;\n                degs[v] = adj[v].size;\n\n            Then, initialize the heap:\n\n                for i in range(N): heapq.heappush(Q, (degs[i], i))\n\n            Then while heap not empty:\n\n                pop the smallest: (d, u) = heap[0]; then pop.\n\n                if flag[u]: continue.\n\n                flag[u] = true.\n\n                // If the list for u is empty? then skip.

But we do that below.\n\n                // Also, we update the degree of u: degs[u] = adj[u].size (but we removed the head, so it's updated) -> but u is removed (flag set) so we don't care.\n\n                // Then for the neighbor v, we push its new degree.\n\n                // But note: the original does: \n                //   degs[v] -= 1   -> we did that by removing the edge.\n                //   then push: heapq.heappush(Q, (degs[v], v))\n\n                // But we have to push even if the degree changed?

But we need to update the priority of v? \n\n                // However, the original heap does not update priorities, it pushes the new degree and then uses a flag to skip old entries.\n\n                // We do the same: we push (degs[v], v) regardless.\n\n            We need to implement a min-heap.\n\n        Given the complexity, we might use a simple array-based heap that supports push and pop.\n\n        We'll have:\n\n            struct Heap {\n                int size;\n                int capacity;\n                int *degrees;   // the degree stored in the heap? but we store (degree, node)\n                int *nodes;\n                int *index;      // index[node] = position in the heap array, for updating? \n                // But note: we are not updating existing entries, we are pushing new ones and then using a flag to skip duplicates.\n\n            We don't need to update, we only push and pop.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Heap:\n                    an array of (degree, node) and we heapify by degree.\n\n                We'll have:\n\n                    struct HeapElement {\n                        int deg;\n                        int node;\n                    } *heap;\n\n                    int heap_size;\n\n                And we have a flag array to mark if a node has been finalized (i.e., flag[u] set to true) or if it has been removed.\n\n                But the algorithm already has a flag array. When we pop, we check flag: if flag[u] is true, we skip.\n\n            Steps for heap:\n\n                Initialize heap with N elements: (degs[i], i) for i in range(N).\n\n                Then heapify.\n\n                Then while heap_size>0:\n\n                    pop the top: (d, u) = heap[0]; then remove it and heapify down.\n\n                    if flag[u] is true, skip.\n\n                    else, process u.\n\n                    Then for each neighbor v that we remove an edge from, we do:\n\n                         push (degs[v], v) into the heap: even if degs[v] has changed, we push the new value.\n\n            This is the same as the Python code.\n\n        But note: the heap in the original pushes even if the node is already flagged? But when we pop, we skip. So we do the same.\n\n        Therefore, we design for the first program (when M even):\n\n            We'll create a dynamic buffer for the output: we'll use a string buffer that grows as needed.\n\n            We'll use a linked list for the adjacency lists with cross pointers for removal.\n\n            We'll implement a min-heap (priority queue) that supports:\n\n                push(deg, node)\n                pop() -> (min_deg, node)\n\n            We have:\n\n                struct Heap {\n                    HeapElement *arr;\n                    int size;\n                };\n\n            How to push:\n\n                arr[heap_size] = (deg, node);\n                then heapify up.\n\n            Pop:\n\n                swap arr[0] and arr[heap_size-1];\n                heap_size--;\n                heapify down from 0.\n\n        We'll assume MAX_N = 100000.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            // Allocate memory for the graph and heap.\n\n            // Read N, M.\n\n            // Initialize:\n                adj = (struct AdjList*)calloc(N, sizeof(struct AdjList));   // each AdjList: head and size (we can store size separately in degs? but we have degs array too)\n                degs = (int*)calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n                parity = (int*)calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n                flag = (bool*)calloc(N, sizeof(bool));\n                heap = create_heap(N);\n\n            // For each edge (0-indexed from 0 to M-1):\n\n                read a, b -> u = a-1, v = b-1.\n\n                create two nodes and link them.\n\n                insert into u and v's lists.\n\n                degs[u] = adj[u].size;   // or we can do degs[u]++? but we are storing the size in adj[u].size.\n                degs[v] = adj[v].size;\n\n            // Build the heap:\n\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    heap_push(heap, degs[i], i);\n                }\n\n            // We also need a buffer for the output: we'll use a dynamic array of characters.\n\n                char *buffer = NULL;\n                size_t buffer_size = 0;\n                size_t buffer_capacity = 0;\n\n            // While heap.size > 0:\n\n                HeapElement top = heap_pop(heap);\n                int d = top.deg, u = top.node;\n\n                if (flag[u]) continue;\n                flag[u] = true;\n\n                // If there are no edges (d==0), then we break? or skip.\n                if (d == 0) {\n                    // Then we skip.

The degrees of u and v are updated in the adj lists (size) and in degs? \n                // We updated the adj lists: we removed one edge from u and one from v, so adj[u].size and adj[v].size are updated.\n                // We also have degs[u] and degs[v]? We are not using degs array anymore? \n\n                // But we are using degs[v] for pushing? The original uses the current degree. We have the current degree in adj[v].size.\n\n                // So we set:\n                //   degs[u] = adj[u].size;   -> but we don't need degs[u] anymore because u is flagged.\n                //   but for v: we push the new degree: adj[v].size.\n\n                // Push the new state of v: \n                heap_push(heap, adj[v].size, v);\n\n                // Also, note: the degree of u is not pushed again because u is flagged.\n\n            // Then, set first_out = buffer, first_out_len = buffer_size.\n\n        But note: we have output M lines? We removed M edges, so we output M lines.\n\n        We must free the memory.\n\n   However, given the complexity and the length, we might use a simpler representation for the graph if we don't care about the order? \n\n   But the condition in the original: it uses the first element in the set. We are using the first element in the linked list. This is arbitrary, so it matches the arbitrary order of the set.\n\n   Therefore, we'll implement the linked list with head removal and cross pointers.\n\n   Summary of the entire C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        #define MOD (1000000007)\n        #define MAX_N 100000\n\n        // For the first program: graph structures\n        typedef struct AdjNode {\n            int v;\n            struct AdjNode *next;\n            struct AdjNode *prev;\n            struct AdjNode *reverse;   // pointer to the reverse edge node\n        } AdjNode;\n\n        typedef struct {\n            AdjNode *head;\n            int size;\n        } AdjList;\n\n        // Heap structures\n        typedef struct {\n            int deg;\n            int node;\n        } HeapElement;\n\n        typedef struct {\n            HeapElement *arr;\n            int size;\n            int capacity;\n        } Heap;\n\n        // Function prototypes\n        Heap* create_heap(int capacity);\n        void heap_push(Heap *heap, int deg, int node);\n        HeapElement heap_pop(Heap *heap);\n        void heapify_up(Heap *heap, int index);\n        void heapify_down(Heap *heap, int index);\n        void remove_node(AdjList *adj, AdjNode *node);   // remove a node from an adjacency list\n\n        // For the third program\n        void output_pattern(int n);\n\n        int main() {\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            // If M is odd, then we output \"-1\\n\" for the first program and then proceed to second and third.\n            if (M % 2 != 0) {\n                // First program output is \"-1\\n\"\n                // We'll set:\n                char *first_out = \"-1\\n\";\n                int first_out_len = 3;\n\n                // Extract the first line: \n                //   We find the first newline: the first line is \" -1\" (3 bytes: '-', '1', and newline) -> but the first line without the newline is \"-1\" (2 bytes) -> but wait: the first_out is \"-1\\n\", so the first line is the string of the first two bytes and then a newline? \n                //   Actually, the first line is the entire first_out without the newline?

Then in main, after calling output_pattern, we do putchar('\\n') again? That would output two newlines.\n\n   We remove the extra putchar('\\n') after calling output_pattern.\n\n   Also, in the first program when M is even, the first_out_buffer may be empty? But we have M edges, so we output M lines.\n\n   This is a very long program, but it should work in theory.\n\n   Note: This code is not tested and may contain bugs. But it is the general idea.\n\n   Given the complexity, we must be cautious of memory leaks and performance.\n\n   We assume that M and N are up to 100000.\n\n   The heap operations: push and pop are O(log N). Total operations: O(N + M log N) which is acceptable.\n\n   The graph removal: O(1) per edge removal.\n\n   The first program's output buffer: we grow it dynamically.\n\n   The second program: O(L) where L is the length of the first line of the first program output. In the even M case, the first line is one edge: two numbers, so maybe 6+1+6 = 13 characters? So L is at most 20.\n\n   The third program: output_pattern is O(n) in time but we output in chunks so it is efficient.\n\n   We hope it works.\n\n   Let me know if you have any questions."
