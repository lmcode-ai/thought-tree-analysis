Then C = (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3=0. Output: 0. Example 3: n=1, m=1, x=1, matrix: [ [10, 1] ]\n            Then min_cost = 10 -> A=10.\n            B= (10==0)?1:0 -> 0.\n            C=0.

Then we remove {0} and leave {1} and {0,1}. Then we compute min_cost: \n                {1}: cost=0 -> min_cost=0. Then A=0 -> B=1 -> C=1. So output 1. Therefore, the code should be as above.",

So the feature index in the loop (feat from 1 to m) corresponds to column index = feat. This matches. Let's run the example: n=1, m=1, x=1, matrix: [0, 1] -> then for feat=1 (the only feature) we use c[0][1] = 1.\n\n   Correct. One more: n=2, m=1, x=1, matrix: \n        row0: 0, 0 -> c[0][0]=0, c[0][1]=0\n        row1: 0, 1 -> c[1][0]=0, c[1][1]=1\n\n   Then for mask=1 (subset {0}): feature1 = c[0][1] = 0 -> <1 -> remove -> valid[1]=false.\n        mask=2 (subset {1}): feature1 = c[1][1]=1 -> valid -> count=1.\n        mask=3 (subset {0,1}): feature1 = c[0][1]+c[1][1]=0+1=1 -> valid -> count=2. Then we don't break because count>0. Then we compute the min_cost: \n        mask=2: cost = c[1][0]=0. mask=3: cost = c[0][0]+c[1][0]=0+0=0. min_cost=0. Then A=0, then B=1, then C=1. Correct. Therefore, we output the code. Note: We assume n is at least 1 and at most 15? Because 2^n might be 32768 which is acceptable. However, if n=0? The problem doesn't specify. The original Python code: \n        n, m, x = map(int, input().split())\n        then: c = ... for _ in range(n) -> if n=0, then we don't read any rows. Then pre = np.arange(0) -> empty. Then the loop for i in pre+1: ... pre+1 is an empty array? so no combinations. Then we go to the feature loop: for i in range(1, m+1): ... but then l is empty? so in the inner loop we do nothing. Then rem is [] and then we remove nothing. Then we break the feature loop? no, we do nothing and then go to the else: then for i in l: ... l is empty, so we set ans=0? and then print(0) -> but wait, the original code:\n\n            else:   # this else is for the for-loop (meaning if we did not break in the feature loop)\n                for i in l:\n                    ... if ans==0: then ans=ca? but if l is empty, then we skip the loop and ans remains 0? then we print(0). So for n=0: the first program outputs 0. Then the second program: input=0 -> outputs 1. Then the third program: input=1 -> outputs 1. But what does the chain output? 1. However, in our C code for n=0:\n\n            total_masks = 1 << 0 = 1. Then we initialize valid: for mask from 1 to 0? (mask>=1 and mask<1) -> no mask. Then the feature loop: for feat=1 to m: we do nothing? then we set any_empty remains 0? then we go to compute min_cost: \n                for mask=1 to 0: no mask -> min_cost remains LLONG_MAX? then A = LLONG_MAX. Then B = (LLONG_MAX==0)?1:0 -> 0.\n            Then C=0. This is not the same. We must handle n=0. How should we handle n=0? In the original File1: \n                We generate no combinations (because pre+1 is empty) -> so l is []. Then in the feature loop: for each feature, we iterate over j in l (which is empty) -> so rem remains [] and we do nothing. Then we don't break (because len(l) is 0 at the end of the feature? but we break only if during the feature loop we remove the last one? Actually, the break condition is: if len(l)==0 then break and print(-1) -> but wait:\n\n                The code:\n\n                    if len(rem) > 0:\n                        ... remove and then set rem=[]\n                    if len(l)==0:\n                        print(-1)\n                        break So after the first feature, we check: if len(l)==0? yes -> then we break and print(-1). Therefore, for n=0: \n                The first program: after the first feature, we check and l is empty -> so we break and print -1. Then the chain: \n                File1 outputs -1 -> File2 outputs 0 -> File3 outputs 0. So the entire chain outputs 0. Therefore, we must adjust our C code for n=0. In C:\n\n            If n==0, then we have no non-empty subsets? So after the first feature (any feature) we will have no valid subset? So we break and set A=-1. How to handle:\n\n            We can note that if n==0, then we have no rows -> then the set of non-empty subsets is empty -> so we break in the first feature. We can do:\n\n                total_masks = 1 << n;   // which is 1 when n=0. We initialize: for mask=1 to total_masks-1: but when n=0, total_masks=1, so the loop for mask from 1 to 0 -> no masks. Then we enter the feature loop: \n                    for feat=1 to m:\n                        we iterate over masks: no masks -> so count=0 -> then we set any_empty=1 and break. Then A = -1. Then the chain: B=0, C=0. So output 0. Therefore, it works. But note: the original code for n=0 breaks in the first feature and outputs -1. Our code does the same. Therefore, we write the code as above. However, note: the matrix for n=0: we read 0 rows. So we don't allocate any row for c. But our allocation:\n\n        long long **c = ... for i in range(n) -> if n=0, then we don't allocate any row. Then in the feature loop, we never access c because n=0 so the inner loop for i in the subset (which is the rows) doesn't run. So it's safe. We'll write the code accordingly. One last note: the original File1 code uses 0-indexing for the matrix. Our matrix: row i, column j: j=0 for cost, j=1..m for features. This matches.\n\n   Let me write the complete C code. Note: We must free the memory. But if n==0, then we don't allocate any row for c, so we free nothing? for (int i=0; i<n; i++) free(c[i]); -> if n=0, then loop runs 0 times. then free(c);\n\n   That's safe. Code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <limits.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int n, m, x; scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &m, &x);\n\n            // Allocate matrix c: n rows, each row has m+1 integers (0..m)\n            long long **c = (long long **)malloc(n * sizeof(long long *));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                c[i] = (long long *)malloc((m+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {\n                    scanf(\"%lld\", &c[i][j]);\n                }\n            }\n\n            int total_masks = 1 << n;\n            // We'll create a valid array for masks: index 0 to total_masks-1. bool *valid = (bool *)malloc(total_masks * sizeof(bool));\n            //",

Feature1: mask=1: sum_feat = c[0][1]=1 >=1 -> valid -> count=1. Then no break -> then compute min_cost: mask=1: cost=c[0][0]=0 -> min_cost=0 -> A=0. Then B=1, then C= (2*1+1)/3 = 3/3=1 -> output 1. Example 2: n=0, m=1, x=1 -> \n        total_masks=1. Loop for masks: mask from 1 to 0: no mask. Then for feat=1: count=0 -> set any_empty=1 -> A=-1. Then B=0, C=0 -> output 0. Example 3: n=2, m=1, x=1, matrix: [[0,0],[0,1]]\n        total_masks=4. Initialize: valid[1]=true, valid[2]=true, valid[3]=true.\n        Feature1:\n            mask1 (binary01: row0): sum_feat = c[0][1]=0 <1 -> set valid[1]=false.\n            mask2 (binary10: row1): sum_feat = c[1][1]=1 >=1 -> valid, count=1. mask3 (binary11: both): sum_feat = 0+1=1 -> valid, count=2.

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into a single C program.\n The first program (File1) reads input: n, m, x and then a matrix c of size n x (m+1) [since the first column is cost and then m columns of features].\n However, note that the first program may break early and output -1, or else it computes an answer and prints it.\n The second program (File2) reads an integer and prints 1 if the integer is 0, else 0. But note: the second program is designed to run one test case. However, in the chain, the output of the first program is the input to the second? But the chain is executed in sequence: the output of the first is the input to the second, and then the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n But wait: the original description says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So:\n   Input to the entire chain is the input to the first program.\n   Then the output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n   Then the output of the second program becomes the input to the third program.\n\n However, looking at the programs:\n\n   File1: reads n, m, x and then a matrix. It prints either -1 or an integer (the minimum cost).\n   File2: reads an integer and then prints 1 if that integer is 0, else 0. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program gets -1 and outputs 0 (because -1 != 0). Then the third program would get 0 as input? But note the third program reads an integer and then prints (n*2+1)//3.\n\n But the chain is:\n\n   Input1 -> File1 -> Output1\n   Output1 -> File2 -> Output2\n   Output2 -> File3 -> Output3\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". But note: the second and third programs are independent of the first in terms of data? Actually, they form a pipeline.\n\n But wait: the original chain does not pass the entire state. Each program is run separately, so the second program only sees the output of the first, and the third only sees the output of the second.\n\n However, the programs are:\n\n   File1: produces one integer output (either -1 or a positive integer, the minimum cost).\n   File2: reads one integer and outputs 1 if it is 0, else 0.\n   File3: reads one integer and outputs (n*2+1)//3.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Step1: Read n, m, x and matrix c (from File1).\n   Step2: Compute the result of File1 (let it be A).\n   Step3: Then for File2: input = A -> output = (A==0)?1:0 -> call this B.\n   Step4: Then for File3: input = B -> output = (B*2+1)//3.\n\n But wait: the original chain runs each program separately. However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\".\n\n We are to do:\n\n   Read the input for the first program (n, m, x and the matrix) from stdin.\n   Then process the entire chain without intermediate I/O (so we simulate the chain internally).\n\n Therefore:\n\n   We will do the computation of File1 to get A.\n   Then use A as input to the logic of File2 to get B.\n   Then use B as input to the logic of File3 to get C.\n   Then output C.\n\n However, note that the first program (File1) might print -1 and then break. But in the chain, that -1 becomes the input to File2.\n\n But the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n So the entire chain output is the output of the third program? But note: the original chain would have three separate outputs? Actually, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the final output of the entire chain is the output of the last program.\n\n Therefore, our C program should:\n\n   Read the input for the first program (n, m, x and the matrix).\n   Then compute the result that the first program would have printed (call it A).\n   Then compute the result that the second program would have printed given A (call it B).\n   Then compute the result that the third program would have printed given B (call it C).\n   Then print C.\n\n But wait: what about the second program? It reads from stdin. However, in the chain, the output of the first is fed to the second as stdin. So in our simulation, we don't actually use stdin for the second and third, we use the computed value from the previous step.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, m, x and the matrix c (n rows, each with m+1 integers: the first is cost and then m features).\n\n   Step 2: Simulate File1:\n\n        We are going to do:\n\n          pre = [0, 1, ..., n-1]\n          l = []   # list of combinations (each combination is a list of indices representing a subset of rows)\n          rem = [] # temporary list for indices to remove\n\n          We iterate i from 1 to n (meaning subset sizes from 1 to n). But note: the code uses `pre = np.arange(n)` and then `for i in pre+1` -> which is 1 to n.\n\n          For each subset size i, we generate all combinations of the indices [0, n-1] taken i at a time.\n\n          Then, for each feature column i (from 1 to m, note: the matrix c has columns: index0 is cost, then feature1 at index1, ... feature m at index m? Actually, the matrix c is read as: each row has m+1 numbers: the first is the cost and then m features. So column0 = cost, column1 to columnm = features.\n\n          The code: for i in range(1, m+1):   -> i is the feature index (from 1 to m)\n\n          For each combination j in the current list l (which is a list of subsets of rows), we compute the sum of the feature i for the rows in the subset.\n\n          If the sum for feature i in the subset j is less than x, we mark j for removal (by adding its index in l to `rem` at the front).\n\n          Then after processing a feature, we remove all the marked combinations (from the list l) and reset rem.\n\n          If at any feature we remove all combinations (so l becomes empty) then we break and output -1 (for File1) and then we break the outer loop.\n\n          Otherwise, after processing all features, we then compute the minimum cost among the remaining combinations: for each subset in l, we compute the total cost (which is column0 of the matrix for the rows in the subset) and then take the minimum.\n\n   Step 3: The result of File1 is A (which is either -1 or the minimum cost).\n\n   Step 4: Simulate File2:\n\n        Given A, we compute B = (A == 0) ? 1 : 0.\n\n   Step 5: Simulate File3:\n\n        Given B, we compute C = (B * 2 + 1) / 3. But note: integer division? In Python: (n*2+1)//3 is integer floor division.\n\n        However, note: B is either 0 or 1.\n\n        If B=0: (0*2+1)//3 = 1//3 = 0.\n        If B=1: (1*2+1)//3 = 3//3 = 1.\n\n        But wait: the third program: if we input 0 -> (0*2+1)//3 = 1//3 = 0 (in integer division). Similarly, 1 -> 3//3=1.\n\n        However, note that the second program outputs 1 only when the input is 0, otherwise 0. So:\n\n          If the first program outputs -1: \n             File2: input=-1 -> output=0 (because -1 !=0).\n             Then File3: input=0 -> output = (0*2+1)//3 = (1)//3 = 0.\n\n          If the first program outputs 0 (which is the minimum cost, meaning free?):\n             File2: input=0 -> output=1.\n             Then File3: input=1 -> output= (2+1)//3 = 3//3=1.\n\n          If the first program outputs a positive integer (say 10):\n             File2: input=10 -> output=0.\n             Then File3: input=0 -> output=0.\n\n        So the entire chain outputs 0 in two cases: either the first program fails (outputs -1) or the first program outputs a positive cost. And outputs 1 only when the first program outputs 0.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"behaves identically\". The original chain would output:\n\n        File1 output: A\n        File2 output: B\n        File3 output: C\n\n        And then the final output is C.\n\n   So we must output C.\n\n   But note: the original chain would output the intermediate results? But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we only output the final result.\n\n   However, there is a problem: the first program might break early and output -1, and then the second and third run. But in the chain, the first program outputs -1 and then exits, then the second program runs with input -1, and then the third. So we must simulate that.\n\n   But note: in the first program, if at any feature we remove all combinations, then it prints -1 and breaks. Otherwise, it computes the minimum cost and prints it.\n\n   Implementation in C:\n\n        We are going to:\n\n          Read n, m, x.\n\n          Allocate a 2D array for c: n rows and (m+1) columns? Actually, each row has m+1 numbers: the first number is the cost, and then m features.\n\n          Then we generate all non-empty subsets of the n rows? Actually, the first program generates subsets for every size from 1 to n. But note: the number of subsets is 2^n - 1, which is too big for n up to 12? But the problem does not specify the constraints.\n\n          However, the original Python code uses itertools.combinations and then stores all subsets in a list. We must do the same.\n\n          Steps for File1:\n\n            Step 1: Generate all non-empty subsets of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. We can do this by generating all bit masks from 1 to (1<<n)-1.\n\n            Step 2: Instead of storing the actual subsets as lists of indices, we can store the bitmask? Or we can store the subset as a list of indices? But note: we need to remove subsets that fail a feature condition.\n\n            However, the original code does:\n\n                l = []\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    for each combination in C(n, i):\n                        l.append(combination)\n\n            Then for each feature i (from 1 to m), we iterate over the current list l and check the sum of the feature i for the rows in the subset.\n\n            Then we remove the subsets that do not meet the requirement for the current feature.\n\n            Then if at the end of the features we have any subsets, we compute the minimum cost.\n\n          We must be cautious: the original code removes subsets during the feature loop. And if at any feature the list becomes empty, we break and output -1.\n\n        Alternative: we can avoid generating all subsets at once? But the problem does not specify constraints on n. However, n is read from input. We must assume n is small (like up to 15) because 2^n is 32768 for n=15, which is acceptable.\n\n        Plan for File1 in C:\n\n            We'll generate all non-empty subsets represented by bit masks from 1 to (1<<n)-1.\n\n            But note: the original code does not consider the empty subset.\n\n            Then, we want to simulate the removal per feature. However, the original code does:\n\n                for feature_index = 1 to m:\n\n                    for each subset in the current list l:\n\n                        compute the sum of the feature (which is column = feature_index) for all rows in the subset.\n\n                    if the sum is < x, mark the subset for removal.\n\n                    then remove all marked subsets.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Instead of having a list of subsets (which might be heavy if we store the entire list of 2^n elements), we can use a bit mask to represent the presence of a subset? But note: we have to remove subsets that fail any feature.\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute for each subset the sum for each feature? Then we can check all features at once? But the original code removes after each feature. However, the condition is: we remove a subset if for the current feature the sum is < x. Then we move to the next feature with the reduced list.\n\n            But note: the removal is per feature. So we cannot precompute for all features at once? Actually, we can. Because the removal condition is independent per feature? Actually, we must check all features? The original code checks feature 1 and removes, then feature 2 on the remaining, etc.\n\n            However, the problem: we are allowed to break as soon as the list becomes empty? But we can simulate the same: we iterate over the features and for each feature we check the remaining subsets.\n\n            We can maintain a list (or an array) of the subsets that are still alive. We can represent each subset by its bitmask and also we can precompute the sums for each subset and each feature? But that would be m * (2^n) which might be acceptable for n<=15 and m<=12? (m is the number of features, which is read from input).\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute the sum for a feature for a subset by iterating over the rows? And we do that for each feature and each subset? That would be O(n * m * (2^n)), which is acceptable for n=15 (2^15=32768, 15*12*32768 ~ 5.9e6, which is acceptable in C).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Let total_subsets = (1 << n) - 1. We'll create an array `valid` of booleans of size (1<<n) (indexed from 0 to (1<<n)-1). We mark the empty subset (0) as invalid? Actually, we don't generate the empty subset. We consider masks from 1 to (1<<n)-1.\n\n                Initially, mark all non-empty subsets as valid.\n\n                Then for each feature from 1 to m (index in the matrix: the feature is at column = feature_index, which in our matrix is column `feature_index`? Note: the matrix c: row i has:\n\n                    c[i][0] = cost\n                    c[i][1] = feature1\n                    ...\n                    c[i][m] = feature m   (since we read m features per row, so total columns = m+1)\n\n                For each feature index `feat` from 1 to m (so column index = feat, where feat from 1 to m):\n\n                    For each bitmask from 1 to (1<<n)-1:\n\n                        If the subset is still valid, then compute the sum of c[i][feat] for every row i that is in the subset.\n\n                    But note: we can break early if we see that the entire list becomes empty? Actually, we are iterating over all subsets for each feature.\n\n                However, the original code breaks when after processing a feature the list becomes empty? So we can do:\n\n                    For feature in [1, m]:\n                        Let count = 0;\n                        For each bitmask from 1 to (1<<n)-1:\n                            if valid[bitmask] is true:\n                                compute the sum for the current feature for the subset bitmask.\n                                if the sum < x, then mark valid[bitmask] = false;  (meaning remove it)\n                                else, leave it and count++.\n\n                        If count becomes 0 during the feature (or after processing the feature), then we break and set A = -1.\n\n                But note: the original code breaks immediately when it finds that the list becomes empty at the end of a feature removal. So we can break out of the feature loop if after processing a feature we have no valid subsets.\n\n            Then, if we break because of no valid subsets at any feature, then we set A = -1.\n\n            Otherwise, we then compute the minimum cost over all valid subsets:\n\n                min_cost = a big number (like 10**18, but we know the costs are integers, and we know the maximum cost per row? not specified, so we can use long and set to a large value)\n\n                For each bitmask from 1 to (1<<n)-1:\n\n                    if valid[bitmask] is true:\n\n                         compute the total cost for the subset: sum of c[i][0] for each row i in the subset.\n\n                         update min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)\n\n                Then set A = min_cost.\n\n        However, note: the original code does not break the feature loop until the end of the feature even if the list becomes empty? Actually, in the original code, after processing a feature, if the list becomes empty, it breaks the outer loop (which is the feature loop) and prints -1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            int any_empty = 0;\n            for (int feat = 1; feat <= m; feat++) {\n                int count = 0;\n                for (int mask = 1; mask < (1<<n); mask++) {\n                    if (!valid[mask]) continue;\n                    // Compute the sum of feature `feat` for the subset `mask`\n                    long long sum_feat = 0;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        if (mask & (1 << i)) {\n                            sum_feat += c[i][feat];   // note: c[i][feat] is the feature value for row i and current feature (which is at column index = feat)\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (sum_feat < x) {\n                        valid[mask] = 0;\n                    } else {\n                        count++;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (count == 0) {\n                    any_empty = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (any_empty) {\n                A = -1;\n            } else {\n                long long min_cost = LLONG_MAX;\n                for (int mask = 1; mask < (1<<n); mask++) {\n                    if (valid[mask]) {\n                        long long total_cost = 0;\n                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                            if (mask & (1 << i)) {\n                                total_cost += c[i][0];\n                            }\n                        }\n                        if (total_cost < min_cost) {\n                            min_cost = total_cost;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                A = min_cost;\n            }\n\n        But note: the original code does not precompute the entire set of subsets at the beginning? It builds a list of combinations by size. However, we are using bit masks and we are considering all subsets at once. This is equivalent.\n\n        However, the original code does not remove a subset until after the entire feature is processed? Actually, it builds a removal list and then removes at the end of the feature. We are doing the same: we mark as invalid during the feature, but we are counting the remaining as we go? Actually, we mark invalid and then count the ones that are not invalid.\n\n        But note: the removal for the current feature does not affect the computation for the same feature? Because we are iterating over the entire set of subsets that were valid at the start of the feature. We are updating the valid array as we go? Actually, we are updating the valid array and then using the updated valid array for the next features? But in the inner loop for a feature, we are iterating over all masks and we skip the ones that are already invalid? And then we update the ones that are currently valid? So the removal for the current feature is done in one go.\n\n        However, the condition for removal in the current feature is independent. So it's safe.\n\n   Step 6: Now we have A (the result of File1).\n\n   Step 7: Simulate File2: B = (A == 0) ? 1 : 0.\n\n   Step 8: Simulate File3: C = (B * 2 + 1) / 3; but integer division? So: C = (2 * B + 1) / 3 -> but since B is 0 or 1, we can compute:\n\n        If B==0: C = (0+1)/3 = 1/3 -> integer division: 0.\n        If B==1: C = (2+1)/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\n        Actually, we can compute: C = (2*B+1)/3 -> but note: integer division truncates toward zero? However, 2*B+1 is 1 or 3, both positive. So:\n\n            (1) / 3 = 0, (3)/3=1.\n\n        So: C = (2*B+1)/3; -> but this is integer division? In C, for positive integers, it truncates toward zero. So:\n\n            (2*B+1) / 3   -> when B=0: 1/3 = 0, when B=1: 3/3=1.\n\n        But note: we can also do: (2*B+1)/3 -> but if we use integers, then yes.\n\n   Step 9: Print C.\n\n   However, note: the original chain might output:\n\n        File1: outputs A (which is either -1 or the min cost)\n        File2: outputs B (which is 1 if A==0, else 0)\n        File3: outputs C = (B*2+1)//3.\n\n        So we output C.\n\n   But what if the first program fails (A=-1) then we output 0? And if the first program outputs 0 then we output 1? Otherwise, we output 0.\n\n   However, note that the entire chain output is the same as the third program.\n\n   But wait: what about the second program? It only runs if the first program outputs something? The chain: the first program runs to completion and outputs an integer, then the second runs, then the third.\n\n   We are simulating that.\n\n   But note: the first program might output a non-integer? No, it outputs an integer.\n\n   However, the first program outputs -1 only when it breaks early (no valid subset). Otherwise, it outputs the minimum cost (a nonnegative integer? because costs are nonnegative? the input doesn't specify, but we'll assume they are nonnegative?).\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll read n, m, x.\n\n        Then we read the matrix: n lines, each with m+1 integers.\n\n        Then we simulate File1 as above to get A.\n\n        Then B = (A==0)?1:0.\n\n        Then C = (2*B+1)/3;   -> but integer division: so we do (2*B+1)/3? Actually, in C, integer division is truncation. But 2*B+1 is either 1 or 3.\n\n        Then we print C.\n\n   However, note: the third program does: print((n*2+1)//3) where n is the input to the third program (which is B). So we are doing that.\n\n   But wait: the third program in the original chain is independent of the first two? It only uses the output of the second. So we are correct.\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain is:\n\n        tcs = 1\n        for tc in 1..tcs:\n            read a = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n            print(1 if a==0 else 0)\n\n        So it reads one integer and outputs 1 if that integer is 0, else 0.\n\n   So we are simulating that by B = (A==0)?1:0.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the original chain has three programs. We are combining them without intermediate I/O.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Important: We must use long long for the costs and the sums? Because the problem does not specify the bounds.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <limits.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            // Read n, m, x\n            int n, m, x;\n            scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &m, &x);\n\n            // Allocate and read the matrix c: n rows, m+1 columns\n            long long **c = (long long **)malloc(n * sizeof(long long *));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                c[i] = (long long *)malloc((m+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {\n                    scanf(\"%lld\", &c[i][j]);\n                }\n            }\n\n            // If n==0, then we have no subsets? But the problem says n>=? not specified. We assume at least one row.\n\n            // We'll create a valid array for the subsets: size = 1<<n, but we skip the empty set (mask 0).\n            int total_masks = 1 << n;\n            bool *valid = (bool *)malloc(total_masks * sizeof(bool));\n            // Initialize: all non-empty masks are valid initially.\n            for (int i = 1; i < total_masks; i++) {\n                valid[i] = true;\n            }\n            // The empty set (mask0) is not considered.

Only -1? So when A=-1, then B= (A==0)?1:0 -> 0.\n\n   Then C = (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3 -> 0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n   This matches the chain.\n\n   However, note: the original File1 might output a positive integer. Then B=0, and then C=0.\n\n   And if the first program outputs 0, then B=1, and then C=1.\n\n   But what if the first program outputs a positive integer? Then we output 0.\n\n   And if the first program fails (outputs -1) then we output 0.\n\n   And only when the first program outputs 0 then we output 1.\n\n   This seems odd? But that's the chain.\n\n   However, let me check the original File1: when does it output 0? Only if the minimum cost among the valid subsets is 0. That is, if there is a row that has cost 0 and that row alone (or in a subset) meets all the feature requirements? Then the minimum cost is 0.\n\n   So the entire chain outputs 1 only when the minimum cost is 0, and 0 otherwise (including when there is no valid subset or the minimum cost is positive).\n\n   That is the behavior.\n\n   But note: the original File1 outputs -1 when there is no valid subset, and then the chain outputs 0.\n\n   And when there is a valid subset and the minimum cost is positive, the chain outputs 0.\n\n   And when the minimum cost is 0, the chain outputs 1.\n\n   So the final output is 1 if and only if the minimum cost is 0. Otherwise 0.\n\n   This is equivalent to: did we find a valid subset with total cost 0?\n\n   However, note: the minimum cost might be 0, but we might have multiple subsets. We are taking the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, we can actually simplify? But we are following the chain.\n\n   However, note: the original chain does this:\n\n        File1: outputs A = (min_cost if exists, else -1)\n        File2: outputs 1 if A==0, else 0.\n        File3: outputs (output_of_file2 * 2 + 1) // 3.\n\n        So we are doing the same.\n\n   But note: the third program: if we input 0 we get 0, if we input 1 we get 1.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain outputs 1 if and only if the minimum cost is 0, and 0 otherwise.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        if (there is a valid subset and the minimum cost is 0) then output 1, else 0.\n\n   But we are simulating the chain, so we do the steps.\n\n   Let me test with a small example:\n\n        Example 1: n=1, m=1, x=1\n        Matrix: [ [0, 1] ]   -> cost=0, feature1=1.\n\n        Then:\n\n            Subsets: only [0] (mask=1)\n\n            For feature1: sum_feat = 1 >= x -> valid.\n\n            Then min_cost = 0 -> A=0.\n\n            Then B = (0==0) -> 1.\n\n            Then C = (2*1+1)/3 = 3/3=1.\n\n            Output: 1.\n\n        Example 2: n=1, m=1, x=2\n            Matrix: [ [0,1] ]\n\n            For feature1: 1 < 2 -> remove the subset -> then any_empty=1 -> A=-1.\n\n            Then B = (A==0) -> false -> 0.\n\n            Then C = (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3=0.\n\n            Output: 0.\n\n        Example 3: n=1, m=1, x=1, matrix: [ [10, 1] ]\n            Then min_cost = 10 -> A=10.\n            B= (10==0)?1:0 -> 0.\n            C=0.\n\n        Example 4: n=1, m=1, x=1, matrix: [ [0,0] ]\n            Then for feature1: 0<1 -> remove -> any_empty=1 -> A=-1 -> then output 0.\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple rows? \n\n        Example: n=2, m=1, x=1\n            Matrix: \n                row0: [0, 0]\n                row1: [0, 1]\n\n            Subsets: \n                {0}: feature1=0 -> invalid.\n                {1}: feature1=1 -> valid.\n                {0,1}: feature1=0+1=1 -> valid.\n\n            Then we remove {0} and leave {1} and {0,1}. Then we compute min_cost: \n                {1}: cost=0 -> min_cost=0.\n\n            Then A=0 -> B=1 -> C=1.\n\n        So output 1.\n\n   Therefore, the code should be as above.\n\n   However, note: the original File1 code does:\n\n        for i in range(1, m+1):\n            for each subset in the current list l:\n                compute the sum of feature i for the subset\n                if <x, mark for removal.\n            remove the marked ones.\n            if l becomes empty: break and print -1.\n\n        But note: the removal is done per feature in sequence. And we are doing the same: we remove a subset if for the current feature the sum is <x, and then we move to the next feature only with the remaining.\n\n        However, in our C code, we are processing all features for all subsets at once? Actually, no: we process feature1 for all subsets, then remove the ones that fail feature1, then feature2 for the remaining, etc. So it's the same.\n\n   But note: the original code does not precompute the entire set of subsets? It builds a list of combinations by size. However, we are using bit masks and we are considering all subsets. The condition is independent of the size? So it's the same.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code as above.\n\n   However, note: the matrix c: we read the first row as: first number is cost (c[i][0]), then the next m numbers are features (c[i][1] to c[i][m]). So the feature index in the loop (feat from 1 to m) corresponds to column index = feat.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Let's run the example: n=1, m=1, x=1, matrix: [0, 1] -> then for feat=1 (the only feature) we use c[0][1] = 1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   One more: n=2, m=1, x=1, matrix: \n        row0: 0, 0 -> c[0][0]=0, c[0][1]=0\n        row1: 0, 1 -> c[1][0]=0, c[1][1]=1\n\n   Then for mask=1 (subset {0}): feature1 = c[0][1] = 0 -> <1 -> remove -> valid[1]=false.\n        mask=2 (subset {1}): feature1 = c[1][1]=1 -> valid -> count=1.\n        mask=3 (subset {0,1}): feature1 = c[0][1]+c[1][1]=0+1=1 -> valid -> count=2.\n\n   Then we don't break because count>0.\n\n   Then we compute the min_cost: \n        mask=2: cost = c[1][0]=0.\n        mask=3: cost = c[0][0]+c[1][0]=0+0=0.\n        min_cost=0.\n\n   Then A=0, then B=1, then C=1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   Note: We assume n is at least 1 and at most 15? Because 2^n might be 32768 which is acceptable.\n\n   However, if n=0? The problem doesn't specify. The original Python code: \n        n, m, x = map(int, input().split())\n        then: c = ... for _ in range(n) -> if n=0, then we don't read any rows.\n\n        Then pre = np.arange(0) -> empty.\n        Then the loop for i in pre+1: ... pre+1 is an empty array? so no combinations.\n\n        Then we go to the feature loop: for i in range(1, m+1): ... but then l is empty? so in the inner loop we do nothing. Then rem is [] and then we remove nothing. Then we break the feature loop? no, we do nothing and then go to the else: then for i in l: ... l is empty, so we set ans=0? and then print(0) -> but wait, the original code:\n\n            else:   # this else is for the for-loop (meaning if we did not break in the feature loop)\n                for i in l:\n                    ... \n                if ans==0: then ans=ca? but if l is empty, then we skip the loop and ans remains 0? then we print(0).\n\n        So for n=0: the first program outputs 0.\n\n        Then the second program: input=0 -> outputs 1.\n        Then the third program: input=1 -> outputs 1.\n\n        But what does the chain output? 1.\n\n        However, in our C code for n=0:\n\n            total_masks = 1 << 0 = 1.\n            Then we initialize valid: for mask from 1 to 0? (mask>=1 and mask<1) -> no mask. Then the feature loop: for feat=1 to m: we do nothing? then we set any_empty remains 0? then we go to compute min_cost: \n                for mask=1 to 0: no mask -> min_cost remains LLONG_MAX? then A = LLONG_MAX.\n\n            Then B = (LLONG_MAX==0)?1:0 -> 0.\n            Then C=0.\n\n        This is not the same.\n\n        We must handle n=0.\n\n        How should we handle n=0?\n\n            In the original File1: \n                We generate no combinations (because pre+1 is empty) -> so l is [].\n                Then in the feature loop: for each feature, we iterate over j in l (which is empty) -> so rem remains [] and we do nothing. Then we don't break (because len(l) is 0 at the end of the feature? but we break only if during the feature loop we remove the last one? Actually, the break condition is: if len(l)==0 then break and print(-1) -> but wait:\n\n                The code:\n\n                    if len(rem) > 0:\n                        ... remove and then set rem=[]\n                    if len(l)==0:\n                        print(-1)\n                        break\n\n                So after the first feature, we check: if len(l)==0? yes -> then we break and print(-1).\n\n            Therefore, for n=0: \n                The first program: after the first feature, we check and l is empty -> so we break and print -1.\n\n            Then the chain: \n                File1 outputs -1 -> File2 outputs 0 -> File3 outputs 0.\n\n            So the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n        Therefore, we must adjust our C code for n=0.\n\n        In C:\n\n            If n==0, then we have no non-empty subsets? So after the first feature (any feature) we will have no valid subset? So we break and set A=-1.\n\n        How to handle:\n\n            We can note that if n==0, then we have no rows -> then the set of non-empty subsets is empty -> so we break in the first feature.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                total_masks = 1 << n;   // which is 1 when n=0.\n                We initialize: for mask=1 to total_masks-1: but when n=0, total_masks=1, so the loop for mask from 1 to 0 -> no masks.\n\n                Then we enter the feature loop: \n                    for feat=1 to m:\n                        we iterate over masks: no masks -> so count=0 -> then we set any_empty=1 and break.\n\n                Then A = -1.\n\n            Then the chain: B=0, C=0.\n\n            So output 0.\n\n        Therefore, it works.\n\n   But note: the original code for n=0 breaks in the first feature and outputs -1. Our code does the same.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code as above.\n\n   However, note: the matrix for n=0: we read 0 rows. So we don't allocate any row for c. But our allocation:\n\n        long long **c = ... for i in range(n) -> if n=0, then we don't allocate any row.\n\n        Then in the feature loop, we never access c because n=0 so the inner loop for i in the subset (which is the rows) doesn't run.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   One last note: the original File1 code uses 0-indexing for the matrix.

Since 2*B+1 is 1 or 3, and both are positive, integer division in C truncates toward zero, which is the same as floor division for positive numbers.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   Final code:"
