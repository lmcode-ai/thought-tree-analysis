Another known method:\n            res = x / 3;\n            if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) res--;\n\n        Example: \n            x=-1: \n                -1/3 = 0, then remainder is -1 (if the modulus is negative) -> but we check: if remainder ! =0 and x<0 -> then res-- -> -1.\n            x=-2: \n                -2/3 = 0, remainder -2 -> then res-- -> -1.\n            x=-3: \n                -3/3=-1, remainder 0 -> so no change -> -1 -> but we want -1 -> correct? x=-4: -4/3 = -1 (truncation) and remainder? -1 -> then we check: remainder ! =0 -> and x<0 -> then res-- -> -2 -> correct. But the modulus in C: \n            C99 standard: the remainder has the same sign as the dividend. So for x negative, the remainder is negative. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            long long x = (long long)2 * n + 1;\n            long long res = x / 3; if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) {\n                res--;\n            }\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in C for negative numbers: \n            -1 % 3 -> -1? -4 % 3 -> -1? But we want: if the remainder is not zero? Actually, we can use:\n\n            long long rem = x % 3;\n            if (rem != 0 && x < 0) {\n                res--;\n            }\n\n        Example: \n            x=-1: rem = -1 ! =0 -> then res=0-1=-1 -> correct.\n            x=-2: rem = -2 % 3 -> but wait: \n                -2 / 3 is 0? and -2 % 3 is -2? Then we do res = 0; then rem=-2 ! =0 -> then res-- -> -1 -> correct? But in Python: -2 // 3 is -1 -> correct. However, note: In C: \n                    -2 / 3 = 0 (because truncation) -> but that's not the same as Python. Actually, in C: \n                        3 * 0 = 0, then the remainder is -2. But we want the floor: which is -1? because 3 * (-1) = -3, which is less than -2? and the remainder is 1? Actually, we are using the modulus to check non-divisibility.",

Steps:\n\n                if (len == 1) {\n                    if (S[0]=='5' || S[0]=='?') \n                        res2 = 1;\n                    else \n                        res2 = 0;\n                    // but note: if it's '?' then the second program would have done: \n                    //   for j in 0..9: then we count 10? but then the branch in the second program for n==1: \n                    // if S[0]=='?' then it prints 1 -> but actually the dp would have set 10 ways? \n                    //      but the branch for n==1 prints 1 for '?'? //   However, the branch for n==1 is taken and then exits. \n                    // So we don't run the dp for n==1. Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    if (len==1) {\n                        if (S[0]=='5' || S[0]=='?') \n                            res2 = 1;\n                        else \n                            res2 = 0;\n                    } else {\n                        // do the dp\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But wait, the Python code for the second program:\n\n                if n == 1:\n                    if S == '5' or S == '?':\n                        print(1)\n                    else:\n                        print(0)\n                    exit() So we do the same. However, note: the Python code reads the entire string. The condition `n==1` is the length of the string. So in C:\n\n                int len = strlen(S1); if (len==1) {\n                    if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') {\n                        res2 = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        res2 = 0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // do the dp for the entire string\n                }\n\n            But wait: what if the string has one character but that character is not '5' and not '?'? then we output 0. Now, what if the string is \"0\" (one character)? then we output 0. Then we skip the dp. For len>1:\n\n                We initialize a 2D array for dp: \n                    long long dp[len][13];   // but note: mod is 10**9+7 -> we can use int or long long? but mod is 10^9+7, so we can use int. But the dp values can be huge? but modulo mod, so we use modulo 10**9+7. Steps:\n\n                    for i in range(len):\n                        if i==0:\n                            if S1[i]!='?' -> then set dp[0][digit] = 1? \n                            else: for each digit 0..9: set dp[0][digit] = 1\n                        else:\n                            if S1[i]!='?' -> \n                                for each k in 0..12: \n                                    new_state = (k*10 + (S1[i]-'0')) % 13\n                                    dp[i][new_state] = (dp[i][new_state] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod\n                            else:\n                                for j in 0 to 9:\n                                    for each k in 0..12:\n                                        new_state = (k*10+j) % 13\n                                        dp[i][new_state] = (dp[i][new_state] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod\n\n                    Then res2 = dp[len-1][5]\n\n            However, note: the Python code uses 0-indexing and the last state is at index len-1.",

Only if k*10+digit is negative? If the string has a minus? then digit is negative. Then we do:\n\n            We added: if (new_state<0) new_state += 13. But the original program in Python: \n            (k * 10 + digit) % 13 -> in Python, the modulus is nonnegative. So we adjust negative mod to be in [0,12]. But even if the digit is positive, the expression is nonnegative? Only if the digit is negative (because of a minus) then we might get negative. We do the adjustment: if negative, add 13 until nonnegative? But modulo 13: we can do:\n\n            new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13; if (new_state < 0) new_state += 13;\n\n        But the original Python does nonnegative modulus. However, if the string is all digits, then digit is nonnegative and k is in [0,12] -> then k*10+digit is nonnegative. So we don't need it for the nonnegative case. But if the first program outputs a negative, then we might have a negative digit? and then the modulus might be negative?",

      "text": "Given the complexity, and since the problem does not specify error handling, and the intended input is nonnegative, we will assume the input is nonnegative. We'll hope the judges provide nonnegative input. Final code with the first program handling negative, and the second program handling non-digit by setting the state to zero and then continuing (which will result in res2=0) and then the third program will run. We'll run the entire chain even if there's an error in the second program. This is not identical, but it avoids crash. But the problem says: \"behaves identically\" -> so we must crash? We can crash by:\n\n            if (S1[i]!='?' && !(S1[i]>='0' && S1[i]<='9')) {\n                // force an out-of-bound access:\n                int *p = NULL;\n                *p = 0;   // segmentation fault\n            } But that's not portable and might be caught by the judge. Alternatively, we can output to stderr and exit(1)? We can do:\n\n            if (S1[i]!='?' && !(S1[i]>='0' && S1[i]<='9')) {\n                fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                exit(1);\n            }\n\n        This will terminate the program immediately. Then the third program is not run, and nothing is printed to stdout. This is closer to the Python chain. Therefore, we do:\n\n            In the second program, for each character:\n\n                if (S1[i]!='?') {\n                    if (S1[i]<'0' || S1[i]>'9') {\n                        // invalid character -> crash\n                        fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                        exit(1);\n                    }\n                    digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                    ... update ...\n                } Then if there is a minus, we crash. This is the same as the Python chain. We'll do that. Now, the code for the second program in the len>1 branch:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<len1; i++) {\n                if (i==0) {\n                    if (S1[0]!='?') {\n                        if (S1[0]<'0' || S1[0]>'9') {\n                            fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                            exit(1);\n                        }\n                        int digit = S1[0]-'0';\n                        dp[digit] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        for (int d=0; d<10; d++) {\n                            dp[d] = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // for i>=1\n                    long long new_dp[13] = {0};\n                    if (S1[i] != '?') {\n                        if (S1[i]<'0' || S1[i]>'9') {\n                            fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                            exit(1);\n                        }\n                        int digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                        for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                            if (dp[k]) {\n                                int new_state = (k*10+digit) % 13;\n                                if (new_state<0) new_state += 13; // this line might be redundant for digit>=0\n                                new_dp[new_state] = (new_dp[new_state] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        // ... \n                    }\n                    // copy new_dp to dp\n                }\n            } And in the len1==1 branch, we don't crash on invalid? we just set res2=0. But that branch only does a single character. We already check for '5' and '?'. But if the character is '-', then we set res2=0. That len1==1 branch doesn't crash for non-digit? The Python program in the branch for len1==1: \n            if S=='5' or S=='?': then print(1)\n            else: print(0) It does not crash. So in the len1==1 branch, we should not crash. Therefore, we only crash in the len>1 branch and in the non-first character of the len>1 branch? But the first character of the len>1 branch: we already handled i==0 in the same way. So we are consistent. Let's hope. We'll write the code accordingly. Note: the third program is only run if the second program doesn't crash. Final code below.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Python programs to run in sequence.\n\nStep-by-step plan:\n\n1. The first program reads an integer `n`, computes `(n * 2 + 1) // 3` and prints it.\n\n2. The second program is more complex. It sets up recursion limits and input functions, but note that the input for the second program is the output of the first program. However, looking at the second program, it actually reads a string `S` (which in the chain will be the integer output of the first program, but note: the first program outputs an integer and then a newline? but the second program reads a string). \n\n   But wait: the second program expects a string that might contain digits and '?' and also might have multiple characters. However, the first program outputs an integer (without any formatting) and then a newline. The second program's input is taken via `input()` which reads a line. In the chain, the second program will read the integer (as a string) that the first program printed.\n\n   However, note the second program does:\n      S = str(input())\n      n = len(S)\n\n   Then it processes the string to count the number of ways to replace '?' with digits so that the entire number mod 13 is 5.\n\n   But the output of the first program is an integer. For example, if the input to the first program is 1, then it prints (1*2+1)//3 = 3//3 = 1. So the second program will read the string \"1\", which has length 1. Then it follows the branch for n==1: if the string is '5' or '?' then print 1, else 0. Since it's '1', it prints 0.\n\n   However, the chain is: \n        input -> first program -> output1 -> second program -> output2 -> third program\n\n   The third program reads a string and processes it.\n\n   So the second program must be provided with the output of the first program as a string. The first program outputs an integer without any extra spaces, so it's a string of digits (or possibly negative? but note: the first program: (n*2+1)//3. For n>=0, this is nonnegative. For negative n? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume nonnegative? Actually, the first program doesn't specify. However, the second program expects a string that may contain digits and '?', but the output of the first is only digits and possibly a minus? Let's see: the first program: input is integer, then computes (n*2+1)//3. In Python, integer division is floor division. For negative n: \n        e.g., n=-1: (-2+1)//3 = (-1)//3 -> -1 (since floor division rounds towards -infinity). \n        So we might have negative numbers.\n\n   However, the second program expects a string that might contain non-digit characters? Actually, the second program is designed for a string that contains digits and '?'. But the first program outputs a string representation of an integer (which might be negative, so it would have a minus sign). This will break the second program because the second program only expects digits and '?'.\n\n   But note: the original chain is independent of the sign? Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program outputs a string (by printing) that is the decimal representation of the integer. For negative numbers, it would have a minus. The second program then reads that string. However, the second program's code for processing the string does not account for minus signs. It only handles digits and '?'. So if the first program outputs a negative number, the second program will see a string with a '-' and then digits. This will cause problems because the second program will see a non-digit character that is not '?'. \n\n   But wait: the second program has:\n        if S[i] != '?':\n            ... then it uses int(S[i]) -> which for '-' would crash? Actually, it would try to convert '-' to an integer and that would work? No, because when i=0 and the character is '-', then int('-') would fail? Actually, no: because the entire string is a negative number? But the second program processes each character. For a negative number, the first character is '-' and then digits. The second program would try to convert the '-' to an integer and that would throw an exception.\n\n   However, the problem states: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\". We must assume that the input to the first program is such that the first program produces a nonnegative integer? Or that the second program can handle negative? \n\n   Looking at the second program: it only has two branches: if the character is not '?', then it uses `int(S[i])` which expects a digit. So if the string contains a minus, then at the position of the minus, `int(S[i])` would fail because `int('-')` is not defined.\n\n   Therefore, we must note that the first program's output is nonnegative? Or the problem context? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the first program: (n*2+1)//3. For negative n, the result can be negative. But the second program is not designed for negative numbers. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are to mimic the behavior. So if the original chain fails for negative numbers, then our C program should also fail? But the problem doesn't specify the input domain. \n\n   Since the problem does not specify, we must assume that the input to the first program is such that the output of the first program is nonnegative? Or at least, the second program is only called when the first program outputs a nonnegative integer? \n\n   Actually, the first program: \n        n = int(input())\n        print((n * 2 + 1) // 3)\n\n   Let's test with negative: \n        n = -1: (-2+1)//3 = (-1)//3 -> in Python, floor division: -1 (because -1//3 is -1 in Python). \n        Then the second program gets the string \"-1\", which has two characters. The first character is '-' -> which is not '?', so it tries to convert to int: int('-') -> that is not possible? Actually, no: the character at index0 is '-', and then we try to convert that single character to an integer? But that is not a digit. \n\n   So the original chain would crash for negative numbers? Then our C program should also crash? But we are writing C and we can avoid the crash? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the first program's output is always nonnegative? Let's see: \n        (n*2+1)//3: \n        For n>=0, the expression is nonnegative? \n        n=0: (0+1)//3 = 0\n        n=1: (2+1)//3 = 1\n        n=2: (4+1)//3 = 5//3 = 1 (in integer floor division)\n        n=3: (6+1)//3 = 7//3 = 2\n        ... so nonnegative.\n\n        For n negative: \n        n=-1: (-2+1)//3 = (-1)//3 = -1 (in Python) -> negative.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify that n is nonnegative. However, the second program is designed for a string that contains only digits and '?'. Therefore, the original chain would crash for negative n. \n\n   Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must also crash? Or we can assume the input is nonnegative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can look at the third program: it reads a string and removes non '0'/'1' and also handles 'B' by deleting the last character. It doesn't care about negative? \n\n   But note: the chain is fixed. The second program is given the output of the first as a string. If the first outputs a negative number, the second program will encounter a non-digit and non-'?' character and skip it? Actually, no: the second program doesn't skip, it tries to convert the '-' to an integer and that will cause an exception. \n\n   Therefore, we must assume the input to the first program is nonnegative? Or the problem expects that? \n\n   Let's stick to the requirement: the entire sequence. We are to mimic the behavior. If the original chain crashes for negative, then we should crash. But in C, we can avoid the crash by designing the second program to handle negative? The problem doesn't say we can change the algorithm. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must translate the second program as is. But note: the second program was written for a string that might contain '?' and digits. It does not account for minus. Therefore, we can assume that the input to the second program (which is the output of the first) is nonnegative? \n\n   How do we handle in C? \n\n   We'll compute the first program: which reads an integer, then computes (n*2+1)/3. But note: in C, integer division truncates toward zero. In Python, floor division is used. For nonnegative numbers, they are the same. For negative, they are different. \n\n   Example: \n        n=-1: \n            Python: (-1)//3 = -1\n            C: (-1)/3 = 0 (if we do integer division) -> but wait, in C, -1/3 is 0? Actually, no: -1/3 is 0? Let me check: \n                In C, integer division truncates toward zero. So -1/3 is 0? Actually, no: 3*0=0, which is greater than -1? Then we have to round down? Actually, no: C truncates toward zero. So -1/3 is 0? That is not correct. Actually, -1 divided by 3 is -0.333... which truncates toward zero is 0? But then 0*3 = 0, which is greater than -1? \n\n        Actually, in C, the result of -1/3 is 0? But wait, let me test: \n            In C: \n                int n = -1;\n                int r = (n*2+1)/3; \n                n*2 = -2; then -2+1 = -1; then -1/3 -> 0? because -1/3 is -0.333, truncation to integer is 0? \n\n        But in Python, (n*2+1)//3 for n=-1: \n            (n*2+1) = -1, then -1//3 -> -1 (because floor(-0.333) is -1).\n\n        So for negative numbers, the first program's output in Python is different than what we would compute in C. \n\n        Therefore, we must mimic the Python floor division for negative? \n\n        How to do floor division in C? \n\n        We can do: \n            if (n >= 0) \n                result = (2*n+1)/3;   // This is the same as truncation for nonnegative? \n            else \n                // for negative: we want floor((2*n+1)/3.0)\n                // We can use: \n                //   Let x = 2*n+1;\n                //   Then if x % 3 == 0, then x/3\n                //   else: (x - 3 + (x<0 ? -1 : 1)) / 3? \n                // Alternatively, we can do: \n                //   result = (2*n+1 - (3-1)) / 3;   -> not exactly.\n\n        Actually, a common way: \n            result = (2*n+1) / 3;   // for truncation toward zero.\n            But we want floor. We can do: \n                if ((2*n+1) % 3 == 0) \n                    result = (2*n+1)/3;\n                else \n                    result = (2*n+1 - ( (2*n+1>=0)?0 : 3-1 )) / 3;   // no, that doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n            result = (2*n+1) / 3;\n            if ( (2*n+1) % 3 != 0 && (2*n+1) < 0) \n                result--;\n\n        Example: \n            n=-1: 2*n+1 = -1 -> \n                -1/3 = 0 (truncation) and remainder? -1 mod 3 is 2? Actually, in C: \n                (-1)/3 is 0, and (-1)%3 is -1? Actually, the behavior of % for negative in C is implementation-defined? \n\n        To avoid issues, we can do:\n\n        We know that in Python, floor division is defined as: \n            a // b = floor(a / b)\n\n        We can do: \n            long long x = (long long)2 * n + 1;\n            long long res;\n            if (x >= 0) {\n                res = x / 3;\n            } else {\n                // Adjust for floor division: \n                res = (x - 2) / 3;   // ? Let me test: \n                // For x=-1: (-1-2) = -3, -3/3 = -1 -> correct.\n                // But what about x=-2: (-2-2)/3 = -4/3 -> truncation in C: -1? but we want: floor(-2/3) = -1 -> same? \n                // Actually: -4/3 truncation is -1? \n                // But wait: we want: \n                //   floor(-1/3) = -1 -> we did: (-1-2)/3 = -3/3 = -1 -> correct.\n                //   floor(-2/3) = -1 -> we do (-2-2)/3 = -4/3 -> which in integer division truncates to -1? -> correct.\n                //   floor(-3/3) = -1 -> we do (-3-2)/3 = -5/3 -> truncates to -1? but we want -1? but actually -3/3 is exactly -1, so we don't need the adjustment for multiples? \n                //   Actually, if x is divisible by 3, then we don't want to adjust? \n                //   But our adjustment: (x-2)/3: for x=-3: (-3-2)/3 = -5/3 -> truncates to -1? but -3/3 is -1 -> so we get -1? \n                //   But wait: we want -1 for -3, and we get -1 -> same.\n\n                However, this formula: (x-2)/3 doesn't work for nonnegative. We are only using it for negative.\n\n                But let me test x=-4: \n                    floor(-4/3) = -2? because -4/3 is about -1.33, floor is -2.\n                    Our formula: (-4-2)/3 = -6/3 = -2 -> correct.\n\n                So: \n                    res = (x-2)/3;   // for negative? \n\n                But wait: what if x=-1: \n                    (x-2)/3 = (-1-2)/3 = -3/3 = -1 -> correct.\n\n            }\n\n        However, note: in C, integer division of negative numbers truncates toward zero? But we are doing (x-2)/3: we are subtracting 2 and then dividing by 3. This is an integer division that truncates toward zero? But we want the same as floor? \n\n        Actually, the formula: \n            floor((x)/3) = (x - (3-1)) / 3?   -> not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do without branching by:\n            res = (x - (3-1)) / 3;   // only for negative? \n\n        But note: the problem is that we want to mimic Python's floor division for negative numbers. \n\n        Actually, a known method for nonnegative divisor (3>0) is:\n            res = (x - (x % 3 != 0 ? (x < 0 ? 3 : 0) : 0)) / 3;\n        But modulo in C for negative can be tricky.\n\n        Another known method:\n            res = x / 3;\n            if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) res--;\n\n        Example: \n            x=-1: \n                -1/3 = 0, then remainder is -1 (if the modulus is negative) -> but we check: if remainder !=0 and x<0 -> then res-- -> -1.\n            x=-2: \n                -2/3 = 0, remainder -2 -> then res-- -> -1.\n            x=-3: \n                -3/3=-1, remainder 0 -> so no change -> -1 -> but we want -1 -> correct? \n            x=-4: \n                -4/3 = -1 (truncation) and remainder? -1 -> then we check: remainder !=0 -> and x<0 -> then res-- -> -2 -> correct.\n\n        But the modulus in C: \n            C99 standard: the remainder has the same sign as the dividend. \n            So for x negative, the remainder is negative.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            long long x = (long long)2 * n + 1;\n            long long res = x / 3;\n            if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) {\n                res--;\n            }\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in C for negative numbers: \n            -1 % 3 -> -1? \n            -4 % 3 -> -1? \n\n        But we want: if the remainder is not zero? Actually, we can use:\n\n            long long rem = x % 3;\n            if (rem != 0 && x < 0) {\n                res--;\n            }\n\n        Example: \n            x=-1: rem = -1 !=0 -> then res=0-1=-1 -> correct.\n            x=-2: rem = -2 % 3 -> but wait: \n                -2 / 3 is 0? and -2 % 3 is -2? \n                Then we do res = 0; then rem=-2 !=0 -> then res-- -> -1 -> correct? \n                But in Python: -2 // 3 is -1 -> correct.\n\n            However, note: \n                In C: \n                    -2 / 3 = 0 (because truncation) -> but that's not the same as Python. \n                    Actually, in C: \n                        3 * 0 = 0, then the remainder is -2.\n\n            But we want the floor: which is -1? because 3 * (-1) = -3, which is less than -2? and the remainder is 1? \n\n            Actually, we are using the modulus to check non-divisibility. The condition is: if the number is not divisible and negative, then we subtract one.\n\n        But note: the modulus we get in C is negative? So we are checking: if rem!=0? Then we subtract one. That would work? \n\n        However, for positive: \n            x=1: 1/3=0, rem=1 -> but we don't subtract because x>0 -> correct.\n\n        So the adjustment works.\n\n        But note: the value of n can be large? We are using long long? \n\n        The problem does not specify the range. But the second program uses mod 10**9+7, and the string length is the number of digits of the output of the first program. So the output of the first program might be large? \n\n        We must use a type that can hold the value. The first program: n is integer. Then 2*n might be twice the input. We are using long long to avoid overflow? \n\n        But the input is integer, so we can read as long long? \n\n        Steps for the first program in C:\n\n            long long n;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n            long long x = 2 * n + 1;\n            long long res1;\n            if (x % 3 == 0) {\n                res1 = x / 3;\n            } else if (x > 0) {\n                res1 = x / 3;   // truncation is floor for positive?\n            } else {\n                // x < 0 and not divisible by 3\n                res1 = x / 3 - 1;   // no, wait: our method above was: \n                // Actually: we do:\n                res1 = x / 3;\n                if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) {\n                    res1--;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: for positive non divisible: \n            x=1: 1/3=0 -> which is floor? -> correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without condition for positive? \n\n        Actually, we can do for all:\n\n            res1 = x / 3;\n            if (x % 3 != 0 && x < 0) {\n                res1--;\n            }\n\n        Then we have the result of the first program as `res1`. Then we need to pass this to the second program as a string? \n\n        But note: the second program expects to read a string. So we must convert `res1` to a string. However, the chain is: the output of the first program is printed as a decimal integer (without any formatting) and then the second program reads that entire line as a string. \n\n        So we have to convert the long long to a string. \n\n        However, the entire chain must be in one C program without intermediate I/O. Therefore, we do:\n\n            Step1: read n (long long) and compute the first program's output -> res1 (long long)\n            Step2: convert res1 to a string. But note: if res1 is negative? Then we have to include the minus? But the second program is not designed for negative? \n\n        Since we are in C, we can check: if res1 is negative, then the second program would crash? But the problem says to mimic. So we must crash? Or we can note that the original chain would crash? \n\n        Actually, the second program in Python would crash when it tries to convert the '-' to an integer. In C, we are going to simulate the second program? \n\n        Therefore, we must avoid negative? Or the problem input ensures nonnegative? \n\n        Given the first program: (n*2+1)//3, and for n>=0, the result is nonnegative? \n            n=0 -> 1//3 = 0 -> nonnegative.\n            n=1 -> 3//3=1 -> nonnegative.\n            n=2 -> 5//3=1 -> nonnegative.\n\n        So if the input n is nonnegative, then the result is nonnegative? \n\n        But what if n is negative? \n            The problem does not specify. \n\n        Since the problem says \"the entire sequence\", and the original chain would crash for negative, we can assume the input is nonnegative? \n\n        Alternatively, we can check: if the result of the first program is negative, then we should not run the second program? But the second program is part of the chain. \n\n        How about we do: \n\n            We'll convert `res1` to a string, but if `res1` is negative, then we include the minus? Then the second program will process the string and when it encounters a non-digit (the minus) that is not '?' it will try to convert it to an integer? That will cause an error? \n\n        In C, we are simulating the second program. We can simulate the crash? \n\n        But the problem does not specify error handling. We must produce the same output? \n\n        Alternatively, we note that the second program in Python does:\n\n            if S[i] != '?':\n                ... then int(S[i])\n\n        For a minus, that will throw an exception? \n\n        How to mimic in C? \n\n        We can: when building the string from the long long, we get a minus for negative. Then in the second program's simulation, when we see a character that is not '?' and not a digit? Then we skip? But the Python program does not skip. It tries to convert. \n\n        Actually, the Python program will crash. Therefore, we should crash? \n\n        But in C, we are writing a single program. We can check: if the string contains a non-digit and not '?'? Then we can set the result to 0? But that's not what the Python program does. \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid negative in the first place by ensuring the input n>=0? \n\n        Given the problem does not specify, and the second program is designed for a string of digits and '?', we assume that the input n is such that the first program produces a nonnegative integer? \n\n        Therefore, we can assume res1>=0. \n\n        How to compute the first program: \n            We read n as long long (to avoid overflow) and then compute:\n                x = 2*n + 1\n                res1 = x / 3   (using the adjustment for negative x only: but note, if n>=0, then x>=1? so nonnegative? then no adjustment? \n\n            But wait: if n is very large? then 2*n+1 might be negative? only if n is negative? \n\n            So if n>=0, then x>=1 -> positive. Then we don't need the adjustment? \n\n            Then we can do: \n                res1 = (2*n+1)/3;   // but wait: (2*n+1) might be not divisible? and we want floor division? \n                For nonnegative, integer division in C truncates toward zero? which is the same as floor? \n                Example: (2*2+1)=5, 5/3=1 -> same as floor(5/3)=1.\n\n            So for nonnegative n, we can do: \n                res1 = (2*n+1)/3;\n\n            But note: if (2*n+1) is negative? then we are in trouble? but if n>=0, then 2*n+1>=1 -> positive.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            long long n;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n            long long res1 = (2*n+1) / 3;   // because n>=0 -> 2*n+1>=1, positive.\n\n        But wait: what if n is negative? \n            The problem does not specify. We assume nonnegative? \n\n        However, the problem says \"behaves identically\", so if the input n is negative, we must produce the same as the Python chain? \n\n        But the Python chain for negative n: \n            Step1: reads n (negative) -> computes (2*n+1)//3 -> which is floor((2*n+1)/3) -> negative.\n            Step2: then the second program reads a string that has a minus and then digits -> then when processing the minus, it will crash.\n\n        How to mimic in C? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            long long n;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n            long long x = (long long)2 * n + 1;\n            long long res1;\n            if (x >= 0) {\n                res1 = x / 3;\n            } else {\n                // negative: use the adjustment to get floor division\n                res1 = x / 3;\n                if (x % 3 != 0) {\n                    res1--;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then we convert res1 to a string. Then we run the second program on that string. But the second program in our C code must crash? \n\n        We can simulate the crash? Or we can note that the second program in Python crashes when it tries to convert a non-digit (the minus) to an integer? \n\n        How does the Python program crash? It throws an exception and exits with non-zero? \n\n        But our C program is to produce the same output? The second program in the chain would not produce any output? \n\n        Actually, the second program in the chain: \n            if the string has a minus, then at the first character that is not '?' and not a digit, it will try to convert the minus to an integer -> which fails -> and the program exits with an exception? \n\n        How to mimic? \n\n        We can: when processing the string in the second program, if we find a character that is not '?' and not between '0' and '9', then we break? but that's not what the Python program does. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do nothing and let the conversion of '-' to integer fail? \n\n        But in C, we are going to do:\n\n            int digit = s[i] - '0';   // for a minus, this would be negative? and then we use it as a digit? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            dp[i][ (k * 10 + digit) % 13 ] ... \n\n        But if the digit is negative, then we get a negative index? \n\n        Actually, we should avoid that. \n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem does not specify, and the intended use is nonnegative, we assume that the input n is nonnegative? \n\n        Therefore, we assume n>=0, so res1>=0, so the string is all digits. \n\n        Then we convert res1 to a string. \n\n        Steps for the entire C program:\n\n            Step1: read n (long long) and compute res1 = (2*n+1)/3;   (for n>=0, this is safe)\n\n            Step2: convert res1 to a string (without any sign, because nonnegative).\n\n            Step3: run the second program on that string. The second program is:\n\n                S = the string we got, of length len.\n\n                We simulate the DP for the string: \n                    dp[i][j] for i in [0, len-1] and j in [0,12] -> we do modulo 13.\n\n                We have two cases: \n                    if the character is not '?', then we use the digit (as an integer) and update the dp: \n                         for each state k in 0..12: \n                             new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13\n                             dp[i][new_state] += dp[i-1][k]\n                    else, we loop over j from 0 to 9.\n\n                Then we output dp[len-1][5] modulo mod (10**9+7).\n\n            Step4: the output of the second program is an integer. Then we pass this integer to the third program? \n\n                But the third program reads a string. So we must convert the integer to a string? \n\n            However, note: the chain is:\n\n                First program: output is an integer -> printed as a string (without formatting) -> then the second program reads that string and outputs an integer (the result of dp) -> then the third program reads that integer as a string? \n\n            So we do:\n\n                Step3: after the second program, we get an integer result (call it res2). Then we convert res2 to a string? \n\n            But wait: the third program: \n                s = str(input())\n                my_str = ''\n                for c in s:\n                    if c=='0' or c=='1': \n                        my_str += c\n                    elif c=='B' and len(my_str)!=0:\n                        my_str = my_str[:-1]\n\n                Then print my_str.\n\n            However, the output of the second program is an integer (which is nonnegative? because it's a count mod 10^9+7) and then the third program reads that integer as a string. \n\n            But note: the third program expects a string that may contain '0','1','B', and other digits? \n\n            The third program removes any character that is not '0' or '1', and for 'B' it deletes the last character. \n\n            Example: \n                If the second program outputs 123, then the string is \"123\". \n                Then the third program: \n                    '1' -> add\n                    '2' -> skip (because not '0','1','B')? \n                    '3' -> skip.\n\n                So the result is \"1\".\n\n            But wait: the third program: \n                for c in s:\n                    if c=='0' or c=='1': \n                        my_str += c\n                    elif c=='B' and len(my_str)!=0:\n                        my_str = my_str[:-1]\n\n                So only '0','1','B' are handled. Other characters are skipped.\n\n            How to handle the conversion of the integer to a string? \n\n            We must convert the integer res2 to a string of decimal digits. \n\n            Then we run the third program on that string.\n\n            Then we output the final string.\n\n        Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n            Step 1: Read n (long long) and compute res1 = (2*n+1)/3.\n\n            Step 2: Convert res1 to a string S1.\n\n            Step 3: Run the second program on S1 to get an integer res2.\n\n            Step 4: Convert res2 to a string S2.\n\n            Step 5: Run the third program on S2 to get a string S3.\n\n            Step 6: Print S3.\n\n        But note: the second program has a special case for n==1? \n            In the second program: \n                if n == 1:\n                    if S == '5' or S == '?':\n                        print(1)\n                    else:\n                        print(0)\n                    exit()\n\n            But our string S1 might be of length 1? \n\n            So we must handle that.\n\n        How to implement the second program in C:\n\n            We are given a string S (which is the string representation of res1, without any sign and without leading zeros? but note: if res1 is zero, then the string is \"0\". \n\n            We'll compute the length = strlen(S).\n\n            We'll allocate a 2D dp array: dp[len][13] (we can use a 2D array or two 1D arrays for space).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                if (len == 1) {\n                    if (S[0]=='5' || S[0]=='?') \n                        res2 = 1;\n                    else \n                        res2 = 0;\n                    // but note: if it's '?' then the second program would have done: \n                    //   for j in 0..9: then we count 10? but then the branch in the second program for n==1: \n                    //      if S[0]=='?' then it prints 1 -> but actually the dp would have set 10 ways? \n                    //      but the branch for n==1 prints 1 for '?'? \n                    //   However, the branch for n==1 is taken and then exits. \n                    //   So we don't run the dp for n==1.\n\n                    Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    if (len==1) {\n                        if (S[0]=='5' || S[0]=='?') \n                            res2 = 1;\n                        else \n                            res2 = 0;\n                    } else {\n                        // do the dp\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But wait, the Python code for the second program:\n\n                if n == 1:\n                    if S == '5' or S == '?':\n                        print(1)\n                    else:\n                        print(0)\n                    exit()\n\n            So we do the same.\n\n            However, note: the Python code reads the entire string. The condition `n==1` is the length of the string. \n\n            So in C:\n\n                int len = strlen(S1);\n                if (len==1) {\n                    if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') {\n                        res2 = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        res2 = 0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // do the dp for the entire string\n                }\n\n            But wait: what if the string has one character but that character is not '5' and not '?'? then we output 0.\n\n            Now, what if the string is \"0\" (one character)? then we output 0.\n\n            Then we skip the dp.\n\n            For len>1:\n\n                We initialize a 2D array for dp: \n                    long long dp[len][13];   // but note: mod is 10**9+7 -> we can use int or long long? but mod is 10^9+7, so we can use int.\n\n                But the dp values can be huge? but modulo mod, so we use modulo 10**9+7.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    for i in range(len):\n                        if i==0:\n                            if S1[i]!='?' -> then set dp[0][digit] = 1? \n                            else: for each digit 0..9: set dp[0][digit] = 1\n                        else:\n                            if S1[i]!='?' -> \n                                for each k in 0..12: \n                                    new_state = (k*10 + (S1[i]-'0')) % 13\n                                    dp[i][new_state] = (dp[i][new_state] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod\n                            else:\n                                for j in 0 to 9:\n                                    for each k in 0..12:\n                                        new_state = (k*10+j) % 13\n                                        dp[i][new_state] = (dp[i][new_state] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod\n\n                    Then res2 = dp[len-1][5]\n\n            However, note: the Python code uses 0-indexing and the last state is at index len-1.\n\n        Step 4: convert res2 to a string. We can use sprintf? But note: res2 might be 0? \n\n        Step 5: the third program: \n                We are given a string S2 (the string representation of res2).\n\n                We'll create a buffer (or a stack) to simulate the string building.\n\n                We traverse each character in S2:\n\n                    if c is '0' or '1', then append to the buffer.\n\n                    if c is 'B', then remove the last character (if the buffer is not empty).\n\n                    if c is other (like '2','3',...), then ignore.\n\n                Then we output the buffer.\n\n        Important: we must not use any I/O in the middle. Only the first block reads (from stdin) and the last block writes (to stdout).\n\n        We assume the input n is nonnegative? \n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n            #include <math.h>\n\n            #define MOD 1000000007\n\n            int main() {\n                long long n;\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n\n                // Step 1: first program\n                long long res1 = (2*n+1) / 3;   // for nonnegative n, this is floor division and nonnegative.\n\n                // Convert res1 to a string S1\n                // Maximum digits: about 20 for long long?\n                char S1[25];\n                sprintf(S1, \"%lld\", res1);\n                int len1 = strlen(S1);\n\n                // Step 2: second program\n                long long res2;\n                if (len1 == 1) {\n                    if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') {\n                        res2 = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        res2 = 0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // Create a dp table: dp[i][j] for i in [0, len1-1] and j in [0,12]\n                    // We can use two arrays to save space: dp and next_dp, but we can do 2D array of size [len1][13]\n                    long long dp[13] = {0};   // current row\n                    long long new_dp[13];      // next row\n\n                    // Initialize: for the first character\n                    if (S1[0] != '?') {\n                        int digit = S1[0] - '0';\n                        dp[digit] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        for (int digit = 0; digit < 10; digit++) {\n                            dp[digit] = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    // Process from the second character to the last\n                    for (int i=1; i<len1; i++) {\n                        // clear new_dp\n                        for (int j=0; j<13; j++) {\n                            new_dp[j] = 0;\n                        }\n\n                        if (S1[i] != '?') {\n                            int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                            for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                                if (dp[k]) {\n                                    int new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                                    new_dp[new_state] = (new_dp[new_state] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        } else {\n                            for (int digit=0; digit<10; digit++) {\n                                for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                                    if (dp[k]) {\n                                        int new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                                        new_dp[new_state] = (new_dp[new_state] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        // copy new_dp to dp for the next iteration\n                        for (int j=0; j<13; j++) {\n                            dp[j] = new_dp[j];\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    res2 = dp[5];   // because at the last row, we want state 5\n                }\n\n                // Step 3: third program\n                // Convert res2 to a string\n                char S2[25];   // 20 digits should be enough\n                sprintf(S2, \"%lld\", res2);\n                int len2 = strlen(S2);\n\n                // Now, simulate the third program: \n                //   We'll use a buffer to build the result string, and we'll simulate the operations.\n                //   The buffer: we can use a stack or an array and a top pointer.\n\n                char buffer[100];   // 100 should be enough? the third program might delete, and the input string is at most 20 digits.\n                int top = 0;\n\n                for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n                    char c = S2[i];\n                    if (c=='0' || c=='1') {\n                        buffer[top++] = c;\n                    } else if (c=='B') {\n                        if (top>0) {\n                            top--;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    // else: ignore\n                }\n                buffer[top] = '\\0';   // null terminate\n\n                // Step 4: output the buffer\n                printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But wait: what if the string S1 has a '?'? \n\n        The first program outputs a string of digits. How can it have a '?'? \n\n        The first program outputs an integer. So the string S1 is composed of digits only. Therefore, the second program will never see a '?'. \n\n        Therefore, we can skip the '?' branch in the second program? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire chain. The first program outputs a string of digits. Then the second program: \n            for each character: it's a digit -> so we do the non-'?' branch.\n\n        So we can remove the '?' branch? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\", so we must include the code as given? \n\n        But the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is digits. So we don't need the '?' branch. \n\n        However, to be safe, we leave it.\n\n        Also note: the second program has a branch for n==1? and that branch checks for '5' or '?'. But the input from the first program is digits. So if the first program outputs a string of length 1, then the character is a digit. Then the condition: \n            if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') \n            -> if it's '5', then we output 1; else 0.\n\n        So if the first program outputs 5, then we get 1; otherwise 0.\n\n        This matches the dp? \n\n        Example: \n            First program: n= (3*5-1)//2? Let me compute: \n                We want res1=5: \n                    5 = (2*n+1)/3 -> 2*n+1 = 15 -> n=7.\n\n            Then the string is \"5\", so the second program: \n                len1=1 -> then we do: if '5' -> output 1.\n\n            If we had run the dp for \"5\": \n                dp[0][5] = 1 -> then at the end: dp[0][5] = 1 -> same.\n\n        But the branch for n==1 is taken and we skip the dp. \n\n        But what if the string is \"0\" (one character)? then we output 0.\n\n        Now, what if the string has more than one character? then we run the dp. \n\n        However, note: the first program outputs a string without any '?'. So the '?' branch in the dp will never be taken. \n\n        But we leave it for clarity.\n\n        Also note: the second program uses mod = 10**9+7. We define MOD as 1000000007.\n\n        We assume the input n is nonnegative? \n\n        But if the input n is negative, then the first program's output may be negative? and we don't handle that? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the original chain would crash for negative, we assume nonnegative.\n\n        However, to be safe, we can check: if n<0, then we do the adjustment for the first program? \n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". If the original chain crashes for negative, we can crash? \n\n        How to crash? For example, if the first program outputs negative, then when we convert to string we get a minus. Then in the second program, when we try to convert a minus to a digit: \n            int digit = S1[0] - '0'; \n            This would be negative? and then we use that in the dp? \n\n        But the minus: \n            In the branch for len1==1: \n                we check if the character is '5' or '?'. The minus is not, so we set res2=0.\n\n            But then the third program: we convert 0 to string -> \"0\", then the third program: \n                buffer: we add '0'? then output \"0\".\n\n            But the original chain would crash in the second program? \n\n        Therefore, we must mimic the crash? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll leave it as: if the input is negative, we do the first program with the adjustment for floor division, and then convert the negative number to string (which will have a minus). Then the second program: \n            if the length is 1: \n                if the character is '-' -> then it's not '5' and not '?' -> so we set res2=0.\n            if the length is >1: \n                then we run the dp. For the first character: \n                    if it's '-' -> then we do the non-'?' branch? \n                    then we do: \n                        int digit = '-' - '0'; -> which is negative.\n\n                Then we use that negative digit in the state update: \n                    new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13\n\n                This might be negative? and then we use that as an index? \n\n        That would cause undefined behavior. \n\n        To mimic the crash, we can do: \n\n            In the second program, when we see a character that is not '?' and not a digit, we break? \n\n        But the Python program crashes. \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem states the input is nonnegative? \n\n        We'll assume nonnegative.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n            #include <math.h>\n\n            #define MOD 1000000007\n\n            int main() {\n                long long n;\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n\n                // Step 1: first program\n                // We do floor division: (2*n+1) // 3\n                long long x = 2 * n + 1;\n                long long res1;\n                if (x >= 0) {\n                    res1 = x / 3;\n                } else {\n                    // negative: adjust to get floor division\n                    res1 = x / 3;\n                    if (x % 3 != 0) {\n                        res1--;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Convert res1 to a string S1\n                char S1[25];\n                sprintf(S1, \"%lld\", res1);\n                int len1 = strlen(S1);\n\n                // Step 2: second program\n                long long res2;\n                if (len1 == 1) {\n                    if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') {\n                        res2 = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        res2 = 0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // We'll use a dp array for the current row\n                    long long dp[13] = {0};\n                    // Initialize the first character\n                    if (S1[0] != '?') {\n                        int digit = S1[0] - '0';   // if S1[0] is '-' then digit is negative -> problem\n                        dp[digit] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        for (int d=0; d<10; d++) {\n                            dp[d] = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    for (int i=1; i<len1; i++) {\n                        long long new_dp[13] = {0};\n                        if (S1[i] != '?') {\n                            int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                            for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                                if (dp[k]) {\n                                    int new_state = (k*10 + digit) % 13;\n                                    if (new_state < 0) new_state += 13; // ensure nonnegative?

\n            The Python program: print(my_str) -> which prints the string and a newline.\n\n        So we output with a newline.\n\n        Also, in the second program, when we do (k*10+digit) % 13, the result might be negative? \n            Only if k*10+digit is negative? \n            If the string has a minus? then digit is negative. Then we do:\n\n            We added: if (new_state<0) new_state += 13.\n\n        But the original program in Python: \n            (k * 10 + digit) % 13 -> in Python, the modulus is nonnegative.\n\n        So we adjust negative mod to be in [0,12].\n\n        But even if the digit is positive, the expression is nonnegative? \n\n        Only if the digit is negative (because of a minus) then we might get negative. \n\n        We do the adjustment: if negative, add 13 until nonnegative? \n\n        But modulo 13: we can do:\n\n            new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13;\n            if (new_state < 0) new_state += 13;\n\n        But the original Python does nonnegative modulus. \n\n        However, if the string is all digits, then digit is nonnegative and k is in [0,12] -> then k*10+digit is nonnegative. \n\n        So we don't need it for the nonnegative case. \n\n        But if the first program outputs a negative, then we might have a negative digit? and then the modulus might be negative? \n\n        We added the adjustment to mimic the nonnegative modulus of Python.\n\n        But the Python program doesn't have to adjust because the digit is not negative? \n\n        Since we are assuming nonnegative input, we can skip the adjustment? \n\n        But to be safe, we leave it.\n\n        We'll run a test with n=0:\n\n            Step1: n=0 -> x=1, res1=1/3=0? -> in C: 1/3=0? -> so res1=0.\n\n            Then S1 = \"0\", len1=1 -> then second program: \n                if (S1[0]=='5' or '?')? no -> res2=0.\n\n            Then third program: \n                S2 = \"0\"\n                buffer: we add '0' -> buffer=\"0\", then output \"0\"\n\n            Expected: \n                First program: (0*2+1)//3 = 1//3 = 0 -> then second program: \n                    string \"0\" -> n=1 -> not '5' and not '?' -> output 0.\n                third program: \"0\" -> output \"0\"\n\n            Correct.\n\n        Test n=1:\n            Step1: (2+1)/3=3/3=1 -> S1=\"1\", len1=1 -> res2=0 -> third program: \"0\" -> output \"0\"\n\n        Test n=7: \n            Step1: (14+1)/3=15/3=5 -> S1=\"5\", len1=1 -> res2=1 -> third program: \"1\" -> output \"1\"\n\n        Test n=2:\n            Step1: (4+1)/3=5/3=1 -> S1=\"1\", len1=1 -> res2=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n        Test n=3:\n            Step1: (6+1)/3=7/3=2 -> S1=\"2\", len1=1 -> res2=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n        Test n=10:\n            Step1: (20+1)/3=21/3=7 -> S1=\"7\", len1=1 -> res2=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n        Now, test a two-digit number: n= (3*5 - 1) // 2? \n            We want a two-digit number? \n            How about n=7: already did -> one digit.\n\n            Let me compute: \n                We want the first program to output 10: \n                    (2*n+1)/3 = 10 -> 2*n+1 = 30 -> n=14.5 -> integer? \n                    n must be integer: \n                        2*n+1 = 30 -> n= (30-1)/2 = 14.5 -> not integer.\n\n                Let me take n=16: \n                    (32+1)/3 = 33/3=11 -> string \"11\"\n\n            Then second program: \n                len1=2 -> do dp.\n\n                i=0: \n                    char '1' -> digit=1 -> dp[1]=1.\n\n                i=1: \n                    char '1' -> digit=1 -> \n                    for k=0..12: \n                        only k=1 has value 1.\n                        new_state = (1*10+1) % 13 = 11 %13=11.\n                    so dp[11]=1.\n\n                Then at the end, dp[5] = 0 -> so res2=0.\n\n            Then third program: output \"0\"\n\n        We can try a longer one? \n\n        Alternatively, we can test the third program independently: \n            input: a string that is the string representation of res2.\n\n            Example: if res2=10, then string \"10\": \n                third program: \n                    '1' -> buffer=\"1\"\n                    '0' -> buffer=\"10\"\n                output \"10\"\n\n            But the third program: \n                if the character is '0' or '1', we keep. \n                if it's 'B', we remove last.\n\n            Example: res2=12 -> string \"12\": \n                '1' -> keep -> buffer=\"1\"\n                '2' -> skip -> buffer=\"1\"\n                output \"1\"\n\n            Example: res2=11 -> \"11\" -> \"11\"\n\n            Example: res2=1 -> \"1\" -> \"1\"\n\n        Now, what if the second program outputs a number that has a digit 'B'? \n            The second program outputs a number, so the string is digits only. So no 'B'. \n\n        Therefore, the third program only removes nothing? and keeps the digits '0' and '1'. \n\n        But the string is all digits, so the third program will remove any digit that is not '0' or '1'. \n\n        Example: \n            If the second program outputs 10, then the string is \"10\", then the third program: \n                '1' -> keep -> \"1\"\n                '0' -> keep -> \"10\"\n\n            Output \"10\"\n\n        But wait: the third program: \n            for c in \"10\":\n                c='1' -> add -> \"1\"\n                c='0' -> add -> \"10\"\n\n        So we output \"10\"\n\n        However, the third program in the original chain would output \"10\" and then a newline.\n\n        Therefore, the C program outputs \"10\\n\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: the buffer for the third program: we allocated 100. The string S2 is at most 20 digits, and we remove some, so 100 is enough.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        We include the adjustment for negative in the first program, and then in the second program we do the modulus adjustment to nonnegative.\n\n        But note: the first program's output for negative input: \n            Example: n=-1 -> \n                x = 2*(-1)+1 = -1\n                res1 = (-1)/3; -> in C: -1/3=0? then because remainder: -1%3 might be -1? then we do: if (x % 3 !=0) -> then res1-- -> becomes -1.\n                Then S1 = \"-1\", len1=2.\n\n            Then the second program: \n                i=0: char '-' -> then we do non-'?' branch: \n                    digit = '-' - '0' = 45 - 48 = -3? \n                Then for state k=0..12: \n                    but we haven't initialized for the first character? \n                    We do: \n                        if (S1[0]!='?') -> yes, so we set dp[digit] = dp[-3] = 1? \n                    This is an out-of-bound access.\n\n        To avoid this, we can check: if the character is not a digit and not '?', then we break or set res2=0? \n\n        But the original chain crashes. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            In the second program, for the first character: \n                if (S1[0]!='?') {\n                    if (S1[0]>='0' && S1[0]<='9') {\n                        int digit = S1[0]-'0';\n                        dp[digit] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        // invalid character: then set the entire dp to zero? \n                        // because there is no valid way? \n                        for (int j=0; j<13; j++) dp[j]=0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // ... \n                }\n\n        Then for the subsequent characters: similarly, if we encounter an invalid character, we set the new_dp to zero for all states.\n\n        But the problem says: the entire chain. The original chain would crash, but we want to avoid crash? \n\n        Alternatively, we can mimic the crash by exiting? \n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". \n\n        We'll assume nonnegative input. \n\n        We'll change the code: if the input n is negative, then we do the first program and then if the string S1 contains a minus, then we set res2=0 (or break) and then the third program will output \"0\" for res2=0? \n\n        But the original chain crashes. \n\n        How about we set res2=0 for any string that contains a non-digit and not '?'? \n\n        But the Python program would crash, so we should not produce any output? \n\n        But the Python program would output nothing and exit with an exception? \n\n        Our C program will output the third program's output: which for res2=0 is \"0\". \n\n        This is not the same. \n\n        Therefore, we must not run the third program? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. \n\n        Given the complexity, we assume the input is nonnegative. \n\n        We'll hope the input is nonnegative.\n\n        Final code without handling negative in the second program (but we do the first program correctly for negative) and then if there is a minus, we might crash in the second program? \n\n        We can avoid crash by:\n\n            In the second program, when we convert a character to digit for non-'?' branch, we check if it's a digit? \n\n            Similarly for the first character.\n\n        We do:\n\n            if (S1[i]!='?') {\n                if (S1[i]>='0' && S1[i]<='9') {\n                    digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                } else {\n                    // invalid: then skip this character by not updating any state? \n                    // But the Python program crashes. \n                    // How about we set the entire new_dp to zero? \n                    for (int j=0; j<13; j++) new_dp[j]=0;\n                    // and break out? \n                    // Then the rest of the string is not processed? \n                    // But the Python program crashes at this point. \n                    // So we break the loop and leave the dp as zeros for the rest.\n                    // But we are in the middle of the string. \n                    // We can break the entire i-loop? \n                    // But we don't know the future characters. \n                    // Alternatively, we can set a flag and skip the rest of the string.\n                }\n            }\n\n        We choose to set the new_dp to zero for this position and then continue? But the state is lost. \n\n        But the original program crashes, so we want to have no valid counts? \n\n        Therefore, for the rest of the string, we keep the dp as zeros.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for i in range(len1):\n                if (S1[i]!='?') {\n                    if (isdigit(S1[i])) {\n                        digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                        ... update new_dp ...\n                    } else {\n                        // set new_dp to zeros and mark that we have an error? \n                        for (int j=0; j<13; j++) new_dp[j]=0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    ... \n                }\n\n        Then for the next i, we continue with new_dp (which is zeros), so the whole dp will be zeros.\n\n        Then res2=0.\n\n        Then the third program: output \"0\".\n\n        This is not crashing, but it outputs 0.\n\n        But the original chain crashes and outputs nothing? \n\n        The second program in Python: \n            it crashes at the conversion of a non-digit to int -> so it outputs nothing.\n\n        Then the third program is not run? \n\n        In the chain, the second program crashes and exits, so the third program is not run. \n\n        How to mimic in C? \n\n        We can detect an invalid character and then not run the third program? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output nothing and exit with an error? \n\n        But the problem says: the last block should handle producing output. \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem does not specify error handling, and the intended input is nonnegative, we will assume the input is nonnegative.\n\n        We'll hope the judges provide nonnegative input.\n\n        Final code with the first program handling negative, and the second program handling non-digit by setting the state to zero and then continuing (which will result in res2=0) and then the third program will run.\n\n        We'll run the entire chain even if there's an error in the second program.\n\n        This is not identical, but it avoids crash.\n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\" -> so we must crash? \n\n        We can crash by:\n\n            if (S1[i]!='?' && !(S1[i]>='0' && S1[i]<='9')) {\n                // force an out-of-bound access:\n                int *p = NULL;\n                *p = 0;   // segmentation fault\n            }\n\n        But that's not portable and might be caught by the judge.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output to stderr and exit(1)? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if (S1[i]!='?' && !(S1[i]>='0' && S1[i]<='9')) {\n                fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                exit(1);\n            }\n\n        This will terminate the program immediately.\n\n        Then the third program is not run, and nothing is printed to stdout.\n\n        This is closer to the Python chain.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            In the second program, for each character:\n\n                if (S1[i]!='?') {\n                    if (S1[i]<'0' || S1[i]>'9') {\n                        // invalid character -> crash\n                        fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                        exit(1);\n                    }\n                    digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                    ... update ...\n                }\n\n        Then if there is a minus, we crash.\n\n        This is the same as the Python chain.\n\n        We'll do that.\n\n        Now, the code for the second program in the len>1 branch:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<len1; i++) {\n                if (i==0) {\n                    if (S1[0]!='?') {\n                        if (S1[0]<'0' || S1[0]>'9') {\n                            fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                            exit(1);\n                        }\n                        int digit = S1[0]-'0';\n                        dp[digit] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        for (int d=0; d<10; d++) {\n                            dp[d] = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // for i>=1\n                    long long new_dp[13] = {0};\n                    if (S1[i] != '?') {\n                        if (S1[i]<'0' || S1[i]>'9') {\n                            fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\\n\");\n                            exit(1);\n                        }\n                        int digit = S1[i]-'0';\n                        for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                            if (dp[k]) {\n                                int new_state = (k*10+digit) % 13;\n                                if (new_state<0) new_state += 13; // this line might be redundant for digit>=0\n                                new_dp[new_state] = (new_dp[new_state] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        // ... \n                    }\n                    // copy new_dp to dp\n                }\n            }\n\n        And in the len1==1 branch, we don't crash on invalid? we just set res2=0. But that branch only does a single character. We already check for '5' and '?'. But if the character is '-', then we set res2=0. \n\n        That len1==1 branch doesn't crash for non-digit? \n\n        The Python program in the branch for len1==1: \n            if S=='5' or S=='?': then print(1)\n            else: print(0)\n\n        It does not crash. \n\n        So in the len1==1 branch, we should not crash. \n\n        Therefore, we only crash in the len>1 branch and in the non-first character of the len>1 branch? \n\n        But the first character of the len>1 branch: we already handled i==0 in the same way.\n\n        So we are consistent.\n\n        Let's hope.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: the third program is only run if the second program doesn't crash.\n\n        Final code below."
