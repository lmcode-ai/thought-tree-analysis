Actually, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n\n   File1: prints a sequence of integers (the results for each task index in order from 0 to n-1) on separate lines.\n   File2: reads a single integer (the first integer from the output of File1? but note: File1 outputs multiple integers) -> This is a problem.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". How?\n\n Let me reexamine:\n\n   The first program outputs multiple integers (n integers, one per line). The second program reads a single integer. This mismatch suggests that the chain might be broken.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n We must note:\n\n   The first program reads:\n        n, b\n        then n lines (each with two integers: time and duration)\n\n   and outputs n integers (one per line).\n\n   The second program reads a single integer (presumably the first integer from the first program's output? But the first program outputs n integers). This does not work.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (n lines) becomes the input of the second program? But the second program only reads one integer.\n\n This discrepancy indicates that the chain might be intended as:\n\n   Input for the entire chain: the input for the first program (n, b and then n tasks).\n\n   Then the output of the first program (multiple integers) is fed as input to the second program? But the second program expects one integer.\n\n However, looking at the second program: it reads one integer. But note that the first program outputs multiple integers. The second program would only read the first one and ignore the rest? That doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire sequence of programs is run independently? But the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After reading the problem again: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We have to combine the three programs so that the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n How can we reconcile?\n\n   The first program outputs multiple integers (n integers). The second program expects one integer. This is a problem.\n\n However, looking at the second program: it actually computes a value from a single integer `n`. The first program outputs multiple integers. How is that connected?\n\n It seems there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we run the first program, then take its output and use as input for the second, then the output of the second as input for the third.\n\n But the first program outputs multiple integers (n integers) and the second program reads only one integer. So in the chain, the second program would read the first integer of the first program's output and then the rest of the output would be unread? Then the third program would read the output of the second (a single integer) and then use that to produce the final output.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact mechanism of how the output is passed. In a typical shell pipeline:\n\n   $ python file1.py | python file2.py | python file3.py\n\n Then file2.py reads from stdin, which is the output of file1. But file2.py only reads one integer. So it would read the first integer from the first program's output and then the rest remains in the pipe. But then file3.py would read the next integer? But the second program outputs one integer. So the third program would read that one integer.\n\n However, the second program outputs one integer (the result of its computation). Then the third program reads one integer (the output of the second program). \n\n But note: the first program outputs multiple integers. The second program only reads the first one? Then the third program gets the output of the second? And the rest of the first program's output is lost? That doesn't match the intended behavior.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might intend that the entire output of the first program is the input to the second? But the second program only reads one integer. Then the second program would read the first integer and leave the rest unread. Then the third program would read the next integer? But that breaks the chain.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we have to design:\n\n   The entire program will read the input for the first part (n, b and then n tasks) and then produce the output of the third part (a single integer).\n\n   However, the intermediate steps must process without I/O.\n\n   The output of the first part becomes the input of the second part, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But the first part produces multiple integers (n integers) and the second part expects one integer. How do we connect?\n\n Let me look at the second program: it reads a single integer. So we must use one of the outputs of the first part as the input to the second part? But which one?\n\n The problem does not specify. This suggests that the chain might be broken by design? Or perhaps the second program is meant to run for each output of the first? But that is not what the problem says.\n\n Alternatively, note that the first program outputs the results for each task. The second program then uses one of these? The problem does not specify which.\n\n After careful thought, I notice that the second program does not use the entire output of the first. It only uses the first integer? But that seems arbitrary.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the intended chain is:\n\n   The first program runs and produces a sequence of integers (let's call them a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}).\n\n   Then the second program is run with the first integer (a_0) as input? But the second program's output is then used as input for the third? Then the third program runs and outputs the final answer.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". The output of the first program is the entire set of a_i. The second program then reads from that output. Since the second program only reads one integer, it will read a_0. Then the third program reads the output of the second program (one integer) and produces the final output.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain of programs would not be correct if we only use the first integer. The second program in the original chain (if run independently) reads one integer. So in the chain, it would read the first integer of the previous output.\n\n But then what happens to the rest of the first program's output? They are lost? And the third program only gets one integer from the second program.\n\n This seems arbitrary and not matching the problem.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program is run multiple times? But the problem says \"a single C program\".\n\n Another possibility: the entire output of the first program is considered as a sequence of integers, and the second program is run on each of them? Then the third program is run on the output of the second program? But the second program outputs one integer per input, and the third program then runs on each of these? But the problem says the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n This would mean the third program would run multiple times? But the problem does not specify.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem: \"the entire sequence\" meaning the three programs run in sequence, each taking the entire output of the previous as input.\n\n But the first program outputs n integers (on separate lines). The second program reads one integer (the first one) and outputs one integer. The third program then reads that one integer and outputs one integer.\n\n So the entire chain: \n   Input: the input for the first program (n, b and n tasks)\n   Output: the output of the third program (one integer)\n\n And the intermediate integers (the rest of the first program's output and the output of the second program) are not printed? But the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\", meaning only the last block (the third program) writes to stdout.\n\n So we can design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, b and n tasks). Run the first program's logic and store the results in an array (of n integers). But we are only going to use the first integer of that array for the next step? \n\n   Step 2: Take the first integer from the result array of step1 and use it as the input for the second program.\n\n   Step 3: Take the output of step2 and use it as the input for the third program.\n\n   Step 4: Output the result of the third program.\n\n However, this is arbitrary: why the first integer? The problem does not specify. But note that the second program only reads one integer. So in a pipeline, it would read the first integer of the previous output.\n\n But the original first program outputs the results in the order of the task indices (from 0 to n-1). The first integer is the result for task0.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we run the second program for each output integer of the first? But then the third program would run for each output of the second? That would produce multiple outputs. But the problem says the last block produces output (singular) and the entire chain should behave identically? \n\n The original chain in a shell would be:\n\n   $ python file1.py | python file2.py | python file3.py\n\n Then:\n\n   - file1.py writes multiple integers (each on a new line) to stdout.\n   - file2.py reads the first integer from stdin and then writes one integer to stdout.\n   - file3.py reads that one integer and writes one integer to stdout.\n\n So the final output is one integer.\n\n Therefore, we must do:\n\n   Step1: Run the first program's logic and get an array of integers: `results` of length n.\n   Step2: Use `results[0]` as the input to the second program.\n   Step3: Run the second program with input = `results[0]` to get an integer, say `x`.\n   Step4: Run the third program with input = `x` to get the final integer, and output it.\n\n But note: the first program outputs the results in the order of the index (from 0 to n-1). The first integer printed is `results[0]`.\n\n However, what if the first program outputs -1 for the first task? Then the second program would get -1.\n\n But the second program expects a positive integer? The second program: \n        n = int(input())\n        ... and then does a binary search on triangular numbers.\n\n If we pass -1, then the binary search would break.\n\n This indicates that the intended connection might be different.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the entire output of the first program is intended to be the input to the second program? But the second program only uses the first integer.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I stick to the pipeline behavior: the second program reads the first integer of the first program's output.\n\n But note: the first program might output multiple lines. The second program reads the first integer from the first line.\n\n Therefore, the plan:\n\n   We will simulate the first program and store all outputs (for all tasks) in an array. But we only use the first element of that array for the next stage.\n\n   Then we run the second program with that first integer.\n\n   Then we run the third program with the output of the second.\n\n   Then we output the result of the third program.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the original chain is that the second program reads the first integer of the first program's output and ignores the rest. Then the third program reads the output of the second.\n\n So in the C program, we do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, b, and n tasks) and compute the array `results` of length n (the finish times for each task, or -1 if dropped).\n\n   Step 2: Let `x = results[0]` (the first integer in the output of the first program).\n\n   Step 3: Run the second program with input `x` to compute `y = ...` (the value as in the Python code for file2).\n\n   Step 4: Run the third program with input `y` to compute `z = ...` (the smallest lucky number >= y).\n\n   Step 5: Print `z`.\n\n But note: the original chain would output only one integer (the output of the third program) at the end.\n\n However, the original first program outputs n integers. But in the chain, these n integers are passed to the second program which only reads the first. Then the rest of the integers are not used. And the second program outputs one integer which is passed to the third. The third outputs one integer. So the overall output is one integer.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs a negative integer? The second program: \n        n = int(input())\n        ... then computes triangular numbers. The triangular number formula is for positive integers.\n\n The first program outputs:\n        -1 for a dropped task, or a positive integer (finish time) otherwise.\n\n If the first task is dropped (so results[0] is -1) then the second program would get -1.\n\n The second program:\n\n        n = -1\n        l = 1, r = -1 -> the while loop condition: 1 < -1 is false -> so it breaks the loop.\n        Then: l -= 1 -> l becomes 0.\n        idxcnt = 0\n        then prints: n - idxcnt = -1 - 0 = -1.\n\n Then the third program: \n        It generates a list of numbers (with digits 4 and 7, and equal count) and then finds the smallest such number >= -1. Since all generated numbers are positive, the smallest is 44? (but wait, the list includes 0? no, because we start with 0 and then we multiply by 10 and add 4 or 7. Actually, we start with 0 and then we do:\n            gen(0,0,0) -> then we do gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1). Then 0 is appended? only if number>0 and four==seven -> 0 is not appended because number>0 fails. So the list starts at 44,47,74,77,... So the smallest number >= -1 is 44.\n\n But the original chain would output 44.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the behavior for negative inputs. We assume the input for the first program is non-negative? The problem states: \"when run on the same input\", so we assume valid input.\n\n But note: the first program's input: \n        n, b (both integers) and then n tasks: each task has time and duration (nonnegative?).\n\n The second program expects a positive integer? The problem does not specify.\n\n However, the second program: \n        n = int(input())\n        and then l=1, r=n -> if n is negative, then the while loop condition (l<r) is 1 < negative -> false, then l becomes 0, and then n - 0 = n (negative). Then the third program would run with a negative.\n\n But the third program: \n        It generates numbers that are nonnegative. So the smallest number >= negative input is 44? Actually, the first number in the sorted list is 44? But wait, the generation:\n\n        We start with 0? then we generate 4 and 7. Then from 4: 44,47; from 7:74,77. Then from 44: 444, 447, ... but the list is sorted. The smallest number in the list is 44? Actually, no: there is also 4? But wait: the condition: if (number>0 and four==seven) then append. \n\n        For 4: number=4>0, but four=1 and seven=0 -> not equal -> not appended.\n        For 7: similarly not appended.\n\n        For 44: four=2, seven=0 -> not equal -> not appended? \n        Actually, we are counting: \n            gen(0,0,0) -> then we generate 4 (four=1, seven=0) -> not appended. Then from 4: \n                gen(44,2,0) -> not appended.\n                gen(47,1,1) -> appended (47) -> because 1==1 and 47>0.\n\n        Similarly, from 7: \n                gen(74,1,1) -> appended.\n                gen(77,0,2) -> not appended.\n\n        Then from 44: ... but we don't get any number until 47? So the list starts with 47,74, ...?\n\n        Actually, the generation does a DFS? The order of generation: \n            Start at 0 -> then 4 -> then 44 -> then 444 ... until beyond limit? then backtrack to 447, then 44 then 47? then 4 then 7? then 74, 77, then 744, etc.\n\n        Then we sort the list. The smallest number is 47? or 74? Actually, 47 is 47 and 74 is 74 -> so 47 is smaller.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the number must have equal number of 4s and 7s. The smallest such number is 47 (if we require at least two digits) but note: 0 is not included. Also, we don't have any one-digit number? because one digit: 4 -> four=1, seven=0 -> not equal. Similarly 7. So the smallest is 47? and then 74? then 4477? etc.\n\n        However, 44 and 77 are not included because they don't have equal 4s and 7s? 44 has two 4s and zero 7s -> not equal.\n\n        So the list: \n            two digits: [47,74] -> smallest is 47.\n            four digits: [4444? no, because 4 and 0 -> not. 4477: four=2, seven=2 -> yes. 4747, etc.\n\n        So the smallest is 47.\n\n        Therefore, for input -1, the third program would output 47.\n\n        But the original second program outputs -1 for the input -1. Then the third program outputs 47.\n\n So the chain would output 47.\n\n However, note that the original chain in the shell would output 47.\n\n But the problem says: the entire chain. So we are safe.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the input domain. We assume the input for the first program is as expected.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will break the C program into three parts:\n\n   Part1: Simulate the first Python program (with a queue) and store the results in an array. We only care about the first result for the next step.\n\n   Part2: Implement the second program (binary search for triangular numbers) using the first result from part1.\n\n   Part3: Implement the third program (generate lucky numbers) using the output of part2.\n\n   Then output the result of part3.\n\n Steps for Part1 (the first program):\n\n   We are given:\n        n, b: first line\n        then n lines: each line has two integers (arrival time and duration)\n\n   We simulate:\n\n        We'll use a queue (we can use an array as a circular queue or a linked list). But note: the first program uses a queue.Queue which is FIFO.\n\n        We'll maintain:\n            - a variable `finish_time` (the time when the current running task will finish)\n            - a queue for waiting tasks (with maximum buffer size `b`)\n\n        Steps:\n\n            result = array of integers (size n) initialized to 0.\n\n            We are processing tasks in the order of input (index 0 to n-1).\n\n            For each task i (with arrival time `time` and duration `duration`):\n\n                If the task arrives after the current finish_time and the queue is empty, then we can run it immediately.\n                    finish_time = max(finish_time, time) + duration -> actually, since time>finish_time, so finish_time = time + duration.\n                    result[i] = finish_time.\n\n                Else:\n                    If the task arrives at or after the finish_time and the queue is not empty, then we must pop a task from the queue and run it? Actually, the code in the first program:\n\n                        if task.time > finish_time and remaining.empty():\n                            ... (immediately run)\n                        else:\n                            if task.time >= finish_time and not remaining.empty():\n                                # run a task from the queue (which must be the next one to run) and update finish_time\n                                finish_time, result = run_task(remaining, finish_time)   # note: this runs one task from the queue\n\n                            Then: if the queue has less than b tasks, push the current task. Else, drop (result[i] = -1).\n\n                    But note: what if the task arrives at a time when the server is busy and the queue is not empty? Then we don't run the task immediately, but we try to run a task from the queue? Actually, the condition for running a task from the queue is: if the current task arrives at or after the finish_time and the queue is not empty? Why?\n\n                    Actually, the idea: when a new task arrives, if the server is free (and the queue is empty) then we run the task immediately.\n\n                    Otherwise, if the server is busy, then we cannot run the task now. But if the new task arrives at a time when the server has already finished (but the queue is not empty) then we must run the next task from the queue? That is: when the server becomes free, it takes the next task from the queue.\n\n                    However, the code runs a task from the queue only when the new task arrives at or after the current finish_time and the queue is not empty. This is because the server might have become free at time `finish_time` and then started a task from the queue? But the new task arrives at or after `finish_time`, so we can now start a task from the queue? Actually, we should start a task from the queue as soon as the server becomes free, but the event that triggers that might be the arrival of a new task? \n\n                    The simulation is event-driven by arrivals. So when a new task arrives, we check if the server has finished (if the new task arrives at or after the finish_time) and if there are tasks in the queue, then we run one (and then we might run more? but the code only runs one). Then we check the current task.\n\n                    But note: the condition `if task.time >= finish_time and not remaining.empty()`: then we run one task from the queue. However, what if the server has been free for a while? Then the next task in the queue should have been started at the finish_time? But we don't have an event for the server becoming free. So we do it on the next arrival.\n\n                    This might be a flaw: we only run a task from the queue when a new task arrives? But if no new task arrives, the queue would never be processed? \n\n                    The original code: after processing all tasks, there is a while loop to run the remaining tasks. So we are safe.\n\n            After the for loop, we run the remaining tasks in the queue.\n\n        Implementation in C:\n\n            We'll use an array to simulate the queue (circular queue) or a linked list. Since the maximum size is n, we can use an array of struct for the queue.\n\n            The queue operations: \n                enqueue: add at the rear\n                dequeue: remove from the front\n\n            We need:\n                int front = 0, rear = -1;\n                Task queue[QUEUE_SIZE];   // but QUEUE_SIZE is at most b? Actually, the buffer size is b, so the queue can hold up to b tasks? But note: the condition: if remaining.qsize() < b -> then we push. So the queue can have at most b tasks.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Initialize:\n                    finish_time = 0;\n                    int result[n];   // to store the finish time for each task, or -1 if dropped.\n\n                For i in range(n):\n                    read time, duration for task i.\n\n                    // First, if the server is free (meaning: the queue is empty and the current task arrives after the finish_time) then we run it immediately.\n                    // But note: what if the task arrives at a time when the server is busy? We check: if the task arrives after the server becomes free and the queue is empty -> then run immediately.\n\n                    // However, we might have tasks in the queue that are waiting? So we need to check the queue.\n\n                    // The original code condition: if task.time > finish_time and remaining.empty() -> then run immediately.\n\n                    // But what if task.time <= finish_time? then we cannot run immediately.\n\n                    // Also, if the task arrives and the server is busy (so the queue is non-empty) but the task arrives after the current finish_time? That can't happen because the server is busy until finish_time, so the task arrives at time>=current time? Actually, the server might be busy beyond the arrival time.\n\n                    // The original code does:\n\n                    //   if the current task arrives after the finish_time and the queue is empty: then run immediately.\n\n                    //   else:\n                    //      if the task arrives at or after the finish_time and the queue is not empty: then run one task from the queue (which will update the finish_time) -> then check the current task.\n\n                    // Then: if the queue has less than b, push the current task; else drop.\n\n                    // But note: after running a task from the queue, the finish_time is updated. Then we check the current task: we don't run it immediately? We only push it to the queue? \n\n                    // However, after running a task from the queue, the server might become free at the new finish_time? But we don't check if the current task can run immediately? \n\n                    // Actually, the current task is not run immediately even if the server becomes free? It is pushed to the queue? \n\n                    // The original code does not run the current task immediately in the same event? It only runs one task from the queue (if condition holds) and then the current task is either enqueued or dropped.\n\n                    // So the current task is always enqueued or dropped? unless the condition for immediate running holds.\n\n                    // Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n                    //   Step 1: While the queue is not empty and the current time (the arrival time of the current task) is >= finish_time, then we can run a task from the queue? But the condition in the code is only once? \n\n                    //   Actually, the code only runs one task from the queue per new task? Why not run all tasks that can be started by the time the current task arrives? \n\n                    //   But note: the server can only run one task at a time. And the next task in the queue is started at the finish_time of the previous. So if the current task arrives at time T, then we should run as many tasks from the queue as we can until the server is busy beyond T? \n\n                    //   The original code only runs one? \n\n                    //   Let me see: the condition is only checked once. Then we push the current task.\n\n                    //   However, after the for loop, we run all remaining tasks. So we don't need to run more than one at a time? \n\n                    //   Why one? Because the current task might be pushed and then later run? \n\n                    //   Actually, the condition: we run one task from the queue if the queue is not empty and the current task arrives at or after the finish_time. This means that the server has already finished the previous task by the time the current task arrives? Then we run one task from the queue (which will set the finish_time to max(finish_time, the task's time) + duration -> but the task from the queue has a time that is <= current task time? \n\n                    //   Actually, the tasks in the queue are stored with their arrival time. But we are using a FIFO. The task at the front of the queue has an arrival time that is <= current time? \n\n                    //   The condition: we run the task from the queue only if the current task arrives at or after the finish_time? Then the server is free at the time of the current task? \n\n                    //   But note: the finish_time is the time the server becomes free. If the current task arrives at or after that, then the server is free. Then we should run the next task from the queue? \n\n                    //   Then we update the finish_time to be the finish time of that task. Then we check the current task: we cannot run it immediately because we just started a task? So we push it to the queue? \n\n                    //   But wait: what if the queue becomes empty after that? Then we could run the current task? The condition for immediate running is: if the current task arrives after the new finish_time and the queue is empty? \n\n                    //   However, we have just updated the finish_time to a value that is at least the current task's arrival time? (because we did max(finish_time, task_to_run.time) -> but task_to_run.time is the arrival time of the task from the queue, which is <= current task's time? and then we add the duration -> so the new finish_time is >= current task's time? \n\n                    //   Therefore, the current task cannot be run immediately? \n\n                    //   So we push it to the queue? \n\n                    //   Therefore, the original code only runs one task from the queue per new task arrival? \n\n            Algorithm for the first program:\n\n                Initialize:\n                    finish_time = 0;\n                    queue (front=0, rear=-1, size=0)\n                    results = array of n integers.\n\n                for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                    read time_i, duration_i.\n\n                    // First, if the server is free and the queue is empty and the task arrives after the finish_time, run immediately.\n                    // But note: the server might be free at finish_time, and if the task arrives after that, then we run immediately.\n\n                    // However, if the task arrives before the finish_time, then the server is busy -> we cannot run immediately.\n\n                    // Also, if the task arrives at or after the finish_time but the queue is not empty, then we need to run a task from the queue? But note: the server becomes free at finish_time, so we can start the next task from the queue at finish_time.

Because if the task arrives exactly at finish_time, then the server is free? But the condition is \">\". \n\n                    // Actually, the condition: if (time_i > finish_time) and queue_empty -> run immediately.\n\n                    // But what if time_i == finish_time? Then we don't run immediately? \n\n                    // Then we go to the else branch.\n\n                    // In the else branch: if (time_i >= finish_time and !queue_empty) -> then run a task from the queue.\n\n                    // Then, if the queue has less than b, we enqueue the current task.\n\n                    // So the condition for immediate running is only when the task arrives after the finish_time and the queue is empty.\n\n                    // This seems to be the key: if the task arrives at the exact time the server becomes free (finish_time) then we don't run it immediately? We run a task from the queue (if any) and then push the current task? \n\n                    // Actually, if the queue is empty and the task arrives at finish_time, then we should run immediately? But the condition requires >. \n\n                    // Let me test with an example: \n                            n=1, b=1, task: (0,10) -> then finish_time=0? Then condition: 0>0 -> false -> else branch. Then condition: time_i>=finish_time -> 0>=0 -> true and queue_empty -> false? (queue is empty -> false) -> so we skip running a task from the queue. Then if queue size < b -> 0<1 -> true -> enqueue. Then after the loop, we run the queue? Then we run the task and set result[0] = max(0,0)+10 = 10.\n\n                    // But if we run immediately, we would get 10 too? But the condition for immediate running is not met.\n\n                    // So the task is enqueued and then run at the end.\n\n                    // But the result is the same.\n\n                    // However, the condition for immediate running should be: if the server is free at the arrival time? meaning: if the arrival time >= finish_time and the queue is empty -> then run immediately.\n\n                    // Why did the code use >? \n\n                    // Let me check: in the original, the condition is: \n                        if task.time > finish_time and remaining.empty(): \n                            ... \n                    // This is a bug? \n\n                    // Actually, the condition should be >=? \n\n                    // But the problem: \"if the task arrives after the finish_time\" -> meaning strictly after? \n\n                    // However, the problem statement of the task scheduling is standard: if the server is free at the arrival time (even exactly) then the task can be started immediately.\n\n                    // So I suspect the condition should be >=.\n\n                    // But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must replicate the condition as in the Python code: >.\n\n                Therefore, we do:\n\n                    if (time_i > finish_time && queue_empty) {\n                        finish_time = time_i + duration_i;\n                        results[i] = finish_time;\n                    } else {\n                        // If the current task arrives at or after the finish_time and the queue is not empty, then we run one task from the queue.\n                        if (time_i >= finish_time && !queue_empty) {\n                            // run one task from the queue: dequeue the front task.\n                            Task next = dequeue();\n                            finish_time = (finish_time > next.time ? finish_time : next.time) + next.duration;\n                            results[next.index] = finish_time;\n                        }\n\n                        // Now, check if we can enqueue the current task?\n                        if (queue_size < b) {\n                            enqueue( Task(time_i, duration_i, i) );\n                        } else {\n                            results[i] = -1;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                Then after the for loop, while the queue is not empty:\n                    Task next = dequeue();\n                    finish_time = (finish_time > next.time ? finish_time : next.time) + next.duration;\n                    results[next.index] = finish_time;\n\n            However, note: the Python code updates the result for the task that is run in a function `run_task` which also returns the updated finish_time and the result dictionary. We are updating the results array.\n\n        Important: the condition for running a task from the queue: we do it only once per new task? \n\n        But what if after running one task from the queue, the finish_time becomes <= current task's time? Then the queue might still be non-empty? But we don't run another? \n\n        That's what the Python code does.\n\n        However, the server is now busy until the new finish_time. The current task then is enqueued (if the queue has space) and then we move on.\n\n        Then at the next task arrival, we might run another task from the queue? \n\n        This is acceptable because we are processing events in order of arrival.\n\n        But note: the current task's arrival time is fixed. After we run one task from the queue, the server becomes free at the new finish_time (which is >= current task's time). Then we enqueue the current task? \n\n        This matches.\n\n   Part2: Second program:\n\n        Input: an integer x (which is results[0] from part1)\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n = x   // but note: the variable in the second program is called `n` and we are using it.\n\n            l = 1, r = n;\n            while (l < r) {\n                mid = l + (r-l)/2;\n                idxcnt = mid*(mid+1)/2.0;   // but note: in Python it uses float? Then compared to n (an integer). Then we cast to int at the end? \n\n                if (idxcnt < n) {\n                    l = mid+1;\n                } else {\n                    r = mid;\n                }\n            }\n            l = l - 1;\n            idxcnt = l*(l+1)/2;\n            result = n - idxcnt;   // then print int(result) -> so we cast to int? but note: in C, integer division? Actually, the numbers are integers.\n\n            But note: the division by 2: in Python, if n is even, then integer division is exact? but the code uses /2 (which in Python for integers might be integer or float? Actually, in Python 3, / is float division. But then the condition compares a float and an integer? \n\n            We can do integer arithmetic in C:\n\n                We can compute: mid*(mid+1)/2 -> but if mid is large, then the product might be even? \n\n            Actually, the triangular number is an integer.\n\n            However, the original code: \n                idxcnt = mid * (mid + 1) / 2   -> but wait: in the Python code it is written as: \n                    idxcnt = mid * (mid + 1) / 2   -> which is a float? \n\n            Then compared to n (which is integer). \n\n            But the problem: the triangular number is integer? only if either mid or mid+1 is even. But the expression mid*(mid+1) is always even? \n\n            So we can do integer division: \n                idxcnt = (mid * (mid+1)) / 2;\n\n            Then the algorithm:\n\n                long long l = 1, r = x;   // because x might be large? but the first program's output is a finish time, which is the sum of times, so it could be large.\n\n                while (l < r) {\n                    long long mid = l + (r - l) / 2;\n                    long long idxcnt = mid * (mid+1) / 2;\n\n                    if (idxcnt < x) {\n                        l = mid + 1;\n                    } else {\n                        r = mid;\n                    }\n                }\n                l = l - 1;\n                long long idxcnt = l * (l+1) / 2;\n                long long y = x - idxcnt;   // this is the result for part2.\n\n   Part3: Third program:\n\n        Input: y (the output from part2)\n\n        We need to generate all numbers composed of digits 4 and 7 that have an equal number of 4s and 7s, and are positive. And then find the smallest such number >= y.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            We generate numbers by DFS? (or BFS) but we sort at the end? The Python code does DFS and then sorts.\n\n            However, we are in C and we don't want to store too many numbers? The limit is 10000000000 (10^10) -> 10 billion. The numbers we generate are in increasing order? But we do DFS: we generate 4, then 44, 444, ... then 4444, ... until beyond the limit. Then backtrack to 4447, etc.\n\n            Then we collect all numbers that have equal number of 4s and 7s and are positive.\n\n            Then we sort the list? But the DFS does not generate in sorted order? So we must store and sort.\n\n            But the list: the numbers can be large? but the count is not too high? The number of digits can be up to 10 (because 10^10 has 10 digits) and the numbers have even number of digits (because #4 = #7). So the number of digits: 2,4,6,8,10. \n\n            How many numbers? \n                For 2 digits: C(2,1)=2 (choose one digit to be 4, the other 7) -> 47,74 -> 2 numbers.\n                For 4 digits: C(4,2)=6 -> but we have to assign two 4s and two 7s -> 4!/(2!2!)=6.\n                For 6 digits: C(6,3)=20.\n                For 8 digits: C(8,4)=70.\n                For 10 digits: C(10,5)=252.\n\n            Total: 2+6+20+70+252 = 350.\n\n            So we can generate all and store in an array.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We create an array (global) to store the numbers.\n\n                We do DFS (recursion) that builds a number (as long long) and counts the number of 4s and 7s.\n\n                We start at 0, with four=0, seven=0.\n\n                Then if the current number>0 and four==seven, we add it to the list.\n\n                Then we recurse: \n                    if (number * 10 + 4) <= limit (10000000000) then DFS(number*10+4, four+1, seven)\n                    similarly for 7.\n\n                Then we sort the array.\n\n                Then we scan the array to find the smallest number >= y.\n\n            However, note: the Python code starts with gen(0,0,0) and then generates. But then it sorts the list.\n\n        But note: the Python code uses a list `l` and then appends. Then sorts. Then we can do the same.\n\n   Finally: we print the result of part3.\n\n   However, note: the first program's output (the entire array) is not printed? Only the first element is used for the next stage. The rest are ignored? \n\n   Therefore, we do not need to store the entire array? We only need the first element. But the first program must compute the entire array to get the first element? Because the first element is the result for the first task. And the processing of later tasks may depend on the state (finish_time and queue) which is updated by the first task.\n\n   So we must run the first program for all tasks? But we only use the first element of the results array for the next stage.\n\n   Therefore, we can run the first program and then take the first element of the results array.\n\n   But note: the first task is the first one read? And the results array is stored in the order of the tasks (index 0 to n-1). So the first task is at index0.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n and b.\n\n        Then for i=0 to n-1: read time_i and duration_i.\n\n        Then simulate the queue as described.\n\n        Then let x = results[0] (the result for the first task).\n\n        Then run part2 on x to get y.\n\n        Then run part3 on y to get z.\n\n        Then print z.\n\n   But note: the second and third programs might be run with negative numbers? But the first task's result might be -1? \n\n   We do as described.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We'll write the entire C program.\n\n   We assume the input integers are within the range of long long? But the problem says the first program's inputs: n, b and then n tasks (time, duration). The constraints? Not given. We assume the worst-case: we use long long for time and duration? But the first program: the finish_time can be large.\n\n   We'll use long long for all time-related variables.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #define QUEUE_SIZE 100000   // but the buffer size is b, which is at most n? and n is up to 100000? \n\n        // For the first program:\n        typedef struct {\n            long long time;\n            long long duration;\n            int index;\n        } Task;\n\n        Task queue[QUEUE_SIZE];\n        int front = 0, rear = -1;\n        int queue_size = 0;\n\n        void enqueue(Task t) {\n            rear = (rear+1) % QUEUE_SIZE;\n            queue[rear] = t;\n            queue_size++;\n        }\n\n        Task dequeue() {\n            Task t = queue[front];\n            front = (front+1) % QUEUE_SIZE;\n            queue_size--;\n            return t;\n        }\n\n        int is_queue_empty() {\n            return queue_size == 0;\n        }\n\n        // For the third program: \n        #define MAX_LUCKY 400  // we have 350 numbers, so 400 is safe.\n        long long lucky_list[MAX_LUCKY];\n        int lucky_count = 0;\n\n        void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n            if (number > 10000000000LL) {\n                return;\n            }\n            if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n                lucky_list[lucky_count++] = number;\n            }\n            gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n            gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n        }\n\n        // Comparison function for sorting\n        int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            long long va = *(const long long*)a;\n            long long vb = *(const long long*)b;\n            if (va < vb) return -1;\n            if (va > vb) return 1;\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Part1: read input for the first program.\n            long long n, b;\n            scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &n, &b);\n\n            // We'll read n tasks.\n            Task *tasks = (Task*)malloc(n * sizeof(Task));\n            long long *results = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                long long time, duration;\n                scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &time, &duration);\n                tasks[i].time = time;\n                tasks[i].duration = duration;\n                tasks[i].index = i;\n                // Initialize results to 0? but the Python code uses 0, but then we might set to -1 or to the finish time.\n                results[i] = 0;\n            }\n\n            // Initialize for simulation:\n            long long finish_time = 0;\n            front = 0; rear = -1; queue_size = 0;   // reset the queue.\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                long long time_i = tasks[i].time;\n                long long duration_i = tasks[i].duration;\n                int idx = tasks[i].index;\n\n                // If the current task arrives after the finish_time and the queue is empty -> run immediately.\n                if (time_i > finish_time && is_queue_empty()) {\n                    finish_time = time_i + duration_i;\n                    results[idx] = finish_time;\n                } else {\n                    // If the task arrives at or after the finish_time and the queue is not empty, run one task from the queue.\n                    if (time_i >= finish_time && !is_queue_empty()) {\n                        Task next = dequeue();\n                        // The start time for the next task is max(finish_time, next.time)\n                        long long start_time = finish_time;\n                        if (next.time > finish_time) {\n                            start_time = next.time;\n                        }\n                        finish_time = start_time + next.duration;\n                        results[next.index] = finish_time;\n                    }\n\n                    // Now, check if we can enqueue the current task?\n                    if (queue_size < b) {\n                        enqueue(tasks[i]);\n                    } else {\n                        results[idx] = -1;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Run the remaining tasks in the queue.\n            while (!is_queue_empty()) {\n                Task next = dequeue();\n                long long start_time = finish_time;\n                if (next.time > finish_time) {\n                    start_time = next.time;\n                }\n                finish_time = start_time + next.duration;\n                results[next.index] = finish_time;\n            }\n\n            // Now, we have the results array.

But the condition: if (number>0 && four==seven) -> then append. So 0 is not appended. And we start with gen(0,0,0) -> then we generate 4 and 7, etc.\n\n   But the DFS: we start with 0, then we call gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1). Then from 4: gen(44,2,0) and gen(47,1,1) -> then 47 is appended. Then from 44: gen(444,3,0) and gen(447,2,1) -> then not appended? until we get to 4477? \n\n   We generate recursively without bounds? But we have the limit: 10000000000.\n\n   We must be cautious: the recursion depth is at most 11 (because 10^10 has 10 digits, then 11 digits exceed the limit) so it's safe.\n\n   However, the C recursion stack? We can use iterative DFS? But 11 levels is safe.\n\n   But note: the function `gen` is called recursively and we don't have tail recursion. The number of calls: each node has two children, and depth up to 11 -> total nodes: 2^12 - 1 = 4095? which is acceptable.\n\n   We'll leave it as recursion.\n\n   But note: the variable `lucky_list` is global. And `lucky_count` is global.\n\n   Also, the second program: we have to handle negative? We did.\n\n   Let me test with a small example for the entire chain.\n\n   Example for the first program:\n\n        Input: \n            n=1, b=1\n            task: (0,10)\n\n        Then: \n            time_i=0, duration_i=10.\n            Condition: 0 > finish_time(0) -> false -> else branch.\n            Then: condition (0>=0 and queue not empty) -> queue is empty -> skip.\n            Then: queue_size=0 < b=1 -> enqueue the task.\n\n            Then after the loop, we run the queue: \n                dequeue: task(0,10,0)\n                start_time = max(0,0)=0, finish_time=0+10=10.\n                results[0]=10.\n\n            Then x = results[0] = 10.\n\n        Part2: \n            n=10.\n            binary search for the smallest m such that m*(m+1)/2 >= 10.\n\n            m=1: 1\n            m=2: 3\n            m=3: 6\n            m=4: 10 -> so l_val becomes 4? \n\n            Steps:\n\n                l=1, r=10\n                mid = (1+10)/2 = 5 -> 5*6/2=15 >=10 -> r=5.\n                then l=1, r=5 -> mid=3 -> 3*4/2=6 <10 -> l=4.\n                now l=4, r=5 -> mid=4 -> 4*5/2=10>=10 -> r=4.\n                then l==r -> break.\n                then l = l-1 = 3.\n                idxcnt = 3*4/2=6.\n                y_val = 10-6=4.\n\n        Part3: \n            The list of lucky numbers: the smallest one >=4 is 47? but wait: 47 is 47 which is >4. But we have 4? -> no, 4 is not in the list. The next is 47? \n\n            But wait: the list includes 47, 74, ... and also 4477, etc. The smallest number >=4 is 47? \n\n            However, we also have 44? no, because 44 has two 4s and zero 7s -> not equal. Similarly, 77 not included. The next is 47.\n\n            So the program outputs 47.\n\n        But the expected output for the entire chain? 47.\n\n   However, the original first program would output 10. Then the second program would output 4. Then the third program would output 47.\n\n   So we output 47.\n\n   But note: the first program outputs the entire array? which is [10]. Then the second program reads 10 and outputs 4. Then the third program reads 4 and outputs 47.\n\n   So the entire chain outputs 47.\n\n   Therefore, the C program outputs 47.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the queue in the first program: we used a circular queue of fixed size QUEUE_SIZE. We set QUEUE_SIZE to 100000. The problem says the buffer size is b, which is at most n? and n is the number of tasks (first integer). We read n up to 100000? \n\n   We assume n <= 100000.\n\n   We'll run.\n\n   Let me test with negative for the second program:\n\n        x = -1 (if the first task is dropped)\n\n        Then in part2: \n            l_val=1, r_val=-1 -> the while loop condition (1 < -1) is false -> so we skip the loop.\n            then l_val = l_val - 1 = 0.\n            idxcnt = 0.\n            y_val = -1 - 0 = -1.\n\n        Then part3: \n            We generate the list and find the smallest number >= -1 -> which is 47? (the smallest positive lucky number) -> 47.\n\n        So output 47.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the DFS for the third program: we start with 0, then we generate 4 and 7, then 44,47,74,77, then 444, etc. We must avoid generating numbers beyond 10000000000.\n\n   We'll use long long for the numbers.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: The DFS might generate 0 repeatedly? But we start with gen(0,0,0) and then we call gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1). Then from 4: gen(44,2,0) and gen(47,1,1). Then from 44: gen(444,3,0) and gen(447,2,1) ... until beyond the limit.\n\n   We do:\n\n        if (number * 10 + 4 <= 10000000000) then call gen(number*10+4, ...)\n        similarly for 7.\n\n   But note: number*10+4 might be beyond the limit? So we check.\n\n   We'll write the gen function recursively.\n\n   We must be cautious: the recursion depth is at most 11 (digits) so it's safe.\n\n   Let me write the gen function again in C:\n\n        void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n            if (number > 10000000000LL) {\n                return;\n            }\n            if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n                // Append to list\n                if (lucky_count < MAX_LUCKY) {\n                    lucky_list[lucky_count++] = number;\n                }\n            }\n            // Recurse for 4 and 7\n            if (number * 10 + 4 <= 10000000000LL) {\n                gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n            }\n            if (number * 10 + 7 <= 10000000000LL) {\n                gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n            }\n        }\n\n   However, we can avoid the multiplication? We can pass the next number as parameter. But it's the same.\n\n   But note: number*10+4 might cause overflow? But we have the condition above: if (number>10000000000) we return. So number is at most 10000000000, then number*10+4 would be 100000000004 which is > 10000000000 -> so we skip. \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (number > 10000000000LL / 10) \n            // then we cannot extend by a digit? but 10000000000 is 10^10, so 10000000000/10 is 10^9. If number is greater than 10^9, then number*10 will be at least 10^10, then adding 4 or 7 will exceed? \n\n        But the condition above already checks: if (number>10000000000) return.\n\n        So we can simply do:\n\n            gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n            gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n\n        and then at the start of the function, we check if number>10000000000 -> return.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Now, the entire program.\n\n   Note: the queue in the first program: we used a fixed-size array. We assume n<=100000, so the queue size is at most b (which is <=n) so 100000 is safe.\n\n   We'll define QUEUE_SIZE as 100000.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   We'll also free the allocated memory.\n\n   We assume the input numbers are within the range of long long.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   Note: the DFS recursion might cause stack overflow? But the depth is at most 11, so it's safe.\n\n   We'll run.\n\n   If there are any issues with recursion depth, we can use an iterative DFS? But 11 levels is safe.\n\n   We'll write the gen function recursively.\n\n   Code:"
