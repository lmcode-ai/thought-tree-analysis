So the above condition is correct. But note: the third program does not count all the odds? It breaks at the second one. However, the frequency count we did is over all digits. The condition in the third program: \n                for key, value in dt.items():\n                    if value % 2 != 0 and cnt < 1:\n                        cnt += 1\n                    elif value % 2 != 0 and cnt >= 1:\n                        x = False\n                        break\n\n            This means: if we have two or more odd frequencies, then x becomes false.

One more corner: the third program sets x = True initially, then sets x = False only when it finds the second odd. But what if there are more than two? Then we break and set x to false and we don't process the rest. But we don't need to: we only care if there is at least two. Our method counts the total number of odds.

But we are using long long. ans1 += i * q * (q+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            // Step2: compute ans2\n            long long ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3;\n\n            // Convert ans2 to a string\n            char s[25]; \n            sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            // Frequency array for digits 0-9\n            int freq[10] = {0};\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {\n                    freq[s[i]-'0']++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            int x = 1; // true\n            int found_odd = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { if (freq[i] == 0) continue;\n                if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {\n                    if (found_odd) {\n                        x = 0;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        found_odd = 1;\n                    }\n                }\n            } if (x) {\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n            } else {\n                if (len % 2 == 0) {\n                    printf(\"Second\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"First\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        } However, note: the third program condition for the string length: the length of the string is the number of characters in the representation of ans2. We have that stored in `len`.\n\n Let me test with N=5:\n\n        Step1: ans1 = 33 (as above)\n        Step2: ans2 = (66+1)/3 = 67/3 = 22 (integer division: 22)\n        String: \"22\", len=2. Frequency: \n            '2': 2 -> even -> so no odd found -> x remains 1 -> output \"First\".\n\n        Correct. Another test: N=1. Step1: \n            i=1: 1 * (1//1=1) * (2)//2 = 1*1*2/2 = 1.\n        Step2: (1*2+1)/3 = 3/3 = 1. String: \"1\", len=1. Frequency: \n            '1':1 -> odd -> found_odd: first odd -> set found_odd=1 -> then no second odd -> x=1 -> output \"First\". Correct. Test with N=2:\n\n        Step1: \n            i=1: 1 * (2//1=2) * (3)//2 = 1*2*3/2 = 3\n            i=2: 2 * (2//2=1) * (2)//2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2\n            ans1 = 5.\n        Step2: (5*2+1)/3 = 11/3 = 3 (since 11//3=3 in integer division)\n        String: \"3\", len=1. Frequency: '3':1 -> odd -> found_odd becomes 1 -> x=1 -> output \"First\". Test with N=3:\n\n        Step1:\n            i=1: 1 * (3//1=3) * (4)/2 = 1*3*4/2 = 6\n            i=2: 2 * (3//2=1) * (2)/2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2\n            i=3: 3 * (3//3=1) * (2)/2 = 3\n            ans1 = 6+2+3 = 11.\n        Step2: (22+1)/3 = 23/3 = 7 (integer division: 23//3=7)\n        String: \"7\", len=1 -> odd frequency -> x=1 -> \"First\". Now, let me try N=4:\n\n        Step1:\n            i=1: 1*4*5/2 = 10\n            i=2: 2*2*3/2 = 6\n            i=3: 3*1*2/2 = 3\n            i=4: 4*1*2/2 = 4\n            ans1 = 10+6+3+4 = 23\n        Step2: (46+1)/3 = 47/3 = 15 (integer division: 15)\n        String: \"15\", len=2. Frequency: \n            '1':1 -> odd -> found_odd=1 (then continue)\n            '5':1 -> odd -> then we have found_odd already -> set x=0 -> break. Then: x=0, and len=2 (even) -> output \"Second\". So for N=4, output \"Second\".\n\n Let me check with the original Python chain:\n\n        File1: \n            N=4 -> \n                i=1: 1 * (4//1=4) * (5)//2 = 1*4*5//2 = 20//2 = 10\n                i=2: 2 * (4//2=2) * (3)//2 = 2*2*3//2 = 12//2 = 6\n                i=3: 3 * (4//3=1) * (2)//2 = 3*1*2//2 = 6//2 = 3\n                i=4: 4 * (4//4=1) * (2)//2 = 4*1*2//2 = 8//2 = 4\n                ans1=10+6+3+4=23 -> print 23.\n\n        File2: \n            n=23 -> (23*2+1)//3 = (46+1)//3 = 47//3 = 15 (in Python: 47//3=15 because 15*3=45, remainder 2 -> floor division gives 15)\n\n        File3: \n            s = list(str(15)) - > ['1','5']\n            dt: \n                '1':1, '5':1 -> both odd? \n                in the loop: \n                    first key: say '1': odd -> cnt becomes 1 -> x remains true? next key: '5': odd -> now cnt>=1 -> set x=False and break. Then: \n                if x: ... -> false\n                elif not x and len(s) % 2==0 -> len=2 is even -> print \"Second\"\n\n        So it matches. Therefore, we write the C program accordingly. Note: the first program uses integer arithmetic.",

So j = 5/1 = 5. block_sum = (3+5)*(5-3+1)/2 = (8*3)/2 = 24/2=12.\n            term = 12 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 12.\n            ans1=15+6+12=33. So it matches. Therefore, we use the optimized loop. Note: the while loop condition: i<=N.\n\n        We are done.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs.\n\n The first program (File1) reads an integer N, then computes:\n   ans = 0\n   for i from 1 to N:\n        ans += i * (N // i) * (N // i + 1) // 2\n\n The second program (File2) takes the output of the first (which is an integer) and computes:\n   n = <output from first>\n   result = (n * 2 + 1) // 3\n\n The third program (File3) takes the output of the second (which is an integer) and then reads a string? \n But note: the original chain is:\n\n   Program1: reads N (integer) -> outputs ans (integer)\n   Program2: reads that integer -> outputs another integer\n   Program3: reads a string? However, the chain of I/O is:\n\n        Input to the entire chain: \n            First, the first program reads N (one integer). Then, the second program reads one integer (the output of first). \n            Then, the third program reads a string? \n\n But wait, the example input for the entire chain must be:\n\n        The first program reads from stdin: one integer N.\n        Then the second program reads from stdin: but actually, the output of the first is the input to the second? \n        However, the original Python programs are written as independent programs that read from stdin.\n\n We are to combine them without intermediate I/O.\n\n How the chain works:\n\n   Step1: Read an integer N (from the initial input) and compute ans1 = f1(N)\n   Step2: Take ans1 and compute ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) // 3\n   Step3: Then, the third program expects to read a string? But note: the entire chain input is only the integer for the first program and then the string for the third? \n\n However, looking at the third program:\n\n      s = list(input())\n\n This implies that the third program is reading a string from stdin. But in the chain, the second program has just printed an integer and then the third program is run. \n\n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", but the third program does not take the output of the second as its input? It reads a string.\n\n This indicates that the chain is:\n\n   Input to the entire process: \n        First, an integer N (for the first program) and then a string (for the third program) on the next line? \n\n But note: the second program outputs an integer and then the third program runs and immediately does `input()`, which would read the next line of the original input.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This implies that the second program's output becomes the input to the third? But the third program does not use that integer? It reads a string.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me reexamine the third program:\n\n   It starts with: `s = list(input())`\n\n   Then it counts the frequency of each character and checks for the number of odd frequencies.\n\n   It does not use the integer from the second program at all? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the third program must take the integer from the second program? \n\n However, the code of the third program does not use the integer. It reads a string.\n\n Therefore, the chain must be:\n\n   Step1: Reads one integer (say N) from stdin.\n   Step2: Reads nothing from stdin? But the second program does `n = int(input())` which would read the next token from stdin. But the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n How can we reconcile?\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This means that:\n\n   Program1: reads from stdin (the entire input provided at the start) and produces output1.\n   Program2: reads output1 as its input (so it does not read from the original stdin again) and produces output2.\n   Program3: reads output2 as its input? But the third program does `input()` which would be the string? \n\n But note: the third program is written to read a string from stdin. However, in the chain, the input to the third program should be the output of the second (an integer). \n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n Let's look at the original chain execution:\n\n   Suppose we have an input file:\n\n        5\n        ababa\n\n   Then we run:\n\n        $ python3 file1.py < input.txt > output1.txt\n        $ python3 file2.py < output1.txt > output2.txt\n        $ python3 file3.py < output2.txt   # but wait, output2.txt contains the integer from file2, but file3.py expects a string? \n\n How does the third program work? It expects a string. But the output of the second program is an integer. So the input to the third program would be a text representation of an integer. \n\n For example, if the first program outputs 33, then the second program outputs (33*2+1)//3 = (66+1)//3 = 67//3 = 22. So the third program would read the string \"22\". \n\n But the third program's logic is about checking the frequency of characters in the string. It counts the frequency of the digits in the string \"22\". \n\n However, the example input also has a string \"ababa\" that is provided. How does that come in?\n\n This suggests that the chain is not correctly described? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire input is:\n\n        <integer N>\n        <string>\n\n and then:\n\n        The first program reads only the integer N and outputs ans1.\n        The second program reads ans1 (as an integer) and outputs ans2 (which is an integer).\n        The third program reads the string (which is the next line of the input) and then uses that string? \n\n But that breaks the chain because the output of the second is not passed to the third? And the third program does not use the integer from the second? \n\n Alternatively, the third program might be intended to take the integer from the second program and use it? But the code does not.\n\n After reading the code of the third program: it does not use the integer at all. It only uses the string from `input()`.\n\n Therefore, the chain must be:\n\n   Input to the entire system is two lines:\n\n        Line1: an integer (for the first program)\n        Line2: a string (for the third program)\n\n   The first program reads the integer and produces an output (integer string).\n   The second program reads that integer string and produces another integer string.\n   The third program then reads the next line of the input? But that would be the string. However, the second program's output is not the input to the third? \n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This implies that the second program's output is the only input to the third. \n\n Therefore, the third program must be reading the integer string from the second program as its input? \n\n And the example input of two lines (the integer and the string) would be used as:\n\n        First program: reads the first line -> produces output1 (integer string)\n        Second program: reads output1 (so it doesn't see the second line) -> produces output2 (integer string)\n        Third program: reads output2 (which is an integer string) and then the third program's `input()` returns that integer string? \n\n But then what happens to the second line of the input (the string)? It is never read? \n\n This is a problem.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem statement: \n        \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n This implies that the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. Then the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n Therefore, the third program does not get the original second line. \n\n How then can the third program work? It requires a string.\n\n The only possibility is that the third program is miswritten? Or the chain is misrepresented? \n\n However, looking at the third program: it does not use any input from the first two. It only uses the string from `input()`. \n\n This leads to the conclusion that the chain of programs is:\n\n        Program1: reads an integer N from the initial input (which is the entire input of the chain) and outputs ans1.\n        Program2: reads the integer ans1 (as a string) and outputs ans2.\n        Program3: reads the integer string ans2 as its input (so the string it gets is the representation of ans2) and then processes that string.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain input is just the integer N. The third program does not get the string \"ababa\" at all. \n\n So the example input is just:\n\n        5\n\n and the chain would run:\n\n        Program1: N=5 -> computes ans = ... \n        Program2: takes that ans and computes another integer\n        Program3: takes that integer as a string and then processes that string of digits.\n\n Therefore, we do not have a separate string input.\n\n Now, let's compute for N=5:\n\n   Program1: \n        i=1: 1 * (5//1=5) * (5+1=6)//2 = 1*5*6//2 = 15\n        i=2: 2 * (5//2=2) * (2+1=3)//2 = 2*2*3//2 = 6\n        i=3: 3 * (5//3=1) * (2)//2 = 3*1*2//2 = 3\n        i=4: 4 * (5//4=1) * (2)//2 = 4\n        i=5: 5 * (5//5=1) * (2)//2 = 5\n        Total = 15+6+3+4+5 = 33\n\n   Program2: (33*2+1)//3 = (66+1)//3 = 67//3 = 22 (integer division)\n\n   Program3: \n        s = list(\"22\") -> ['2','2']\n        dt: \n            '2': count=2 -> even\n        Then the loop: \n            for key,value: only one key '2' -> value=2 (even) -> so no odd count? \n            cnt remains 0 -> then the condition: \n                if value%2 !=0 -> false, so nothing happens.\n        Then x remains True -> prints \"First\"\n\n Therefore, for input 5, the output is \"First\".\n\n But note: the third program also has conditions for when x is false and the length of the string is even or odd. In this case, x is true so it prints \"First\".\n\n Now, what if the output of the second program was an integer that when converted to string has more than one odd frequency? \n\n Example: if the output of the second program was 123, then the string is \"123\". \n        Frequencies: \n            '1':1 -> odd -> cnt becomes 1\n            '2':1 -> odd -> then we get the second odd -> x becomes false -> break.\n        Then we check: x is false, and the length of the string is 3 (odd) -> then we print \"First\".\n\n Another: if the string was \"1122\", then:\n        '1':2 -> even\n        '2':2 -> even -> x remains true -> print \"First\".\n\n But wait, the third program also has a condition: \n        if x: print \"First\"\n        elif not x and len(s) % 2 == 0: print \"Second\"\n        elif not x and len(s) % 2 != 0: print \"First\"\n\n So the third program's output depends on:\n        x: which is false if there is more than one character with odd frequency.\n        and the length of the string (which is the string representation of the integer from the second program).\n\n Therefore, we can summarize the entire chain:\n\n        Step1: Read an integer N.\n        Step2: Compute \n                ans1 = 0\n                for i=1 to N: \n                    term = i * (N//i) * (N//i+1) // 2\n                    ans1 += term\n        Step3: Compute ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3   [using integer division]\n        Step4: Convert ans2 to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) to get a string S.\n        Step5: Count frequency of each char in S.\n        Step6: Count the number of characters that have odd frequency. If that count is 0 or 1, then set x = true, else x = false.\n        Step7: \n                if x: output \"First\"\n                else if the length of S is even: output \"Second\"\n                else: output \"First\"\n\n However, note: the third program condition for x being true does not depend on the count being 0 or 1? Actually, it does:\n\n        The third program sets:\n            cnt = 0\n            for each frequency:\n                if frequency is odd:\n                    if cnt < 1: cnt++ (so we allow one odd)\n                    else: x becomes false and break.\n\n        So if we have at most one odd frequency, then x remains true.\n\n        If we have two or more odd frequencies, then x becomes false.\n\n        Then:\n            if x: \"First\"\n            else: \n                if the length of S is even -> \"Second\"\n                else -> \"First\"\n\n Now, the plan for the C program:\n\n        We will read the integer N (from stdin).\n\n        Step1: Compute ans1 as in the first program.\n\n        Step2: Compute ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3 (using integer division: note that in C, integer division truncates, but the formula uses floor division? \n                Actually, the Python expression: (n*2+1)//3 is integer division that truncates towards -infinity? \n                But note: n*2+1 is positive, so in C we can do: (n*2+1)/3 and since n*2+1 is positive, integer division in C truncates toward 0. \n\n                However, in Python: \n                    (67) // 3 = 22 (exact division: 67/3=22.333... -> floor is 22)\n                In C: 67/3 = 22 (because 67=3*22+1 -> truncation to 22).\n\n                But what if the number is negative? We don't have negative because the first program's output is nonnegative.\n\n                So we can do: ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3;   but note: if (ans1*2+1) is not divisible by 3, then we want the floor.\n\n                However, in C, for positive integers, division truncates toward zero which is the same as floor.\n\n                So it is safe.\n\n        Step3: Convert ans2 to a string. We need to be cautious: the integer might be large? \n\n                The first program: \n                    The sum in the first program: \n                         ans1 = sum_{i=1}^{N} i * (N//i) * (N//i+1) // 2\n\n                How big can this be? \n\n                Note: i goes from 1 to N, and each term is about i * (N/i)^2 = N^2 / i. So the total is about O(N^2 * log(N))? \n\n                But N is the input. The input N can be up to ... we don't know. But the problem does not specify constraints. \n\n                However, we must be cautious. The second program's output ans2 is about (2 * ans1 + 1) / 3, which is about O(N^2 * log(N)). \n\n                For N=10^5: \n                    The sum might be about (10^5)^2 * log(10^5) = 10^10 * 16 (approx) = 1.6e11, which is within the range of long long (up to 9e18).\n\n                But the problem does not specify constraints. We'll assume that N can be up to 10^5? \n\n                So we use long long for the first two steps.\n\n        Step4: Convert the long long integer ans2 to a string. The maximum number of digits: about 20.\n\n        Step5: Build a frequency table for the characters in that string. Since the string only contains digits, we can use an array of size 10? \n                But wait: what if the number is negative? It isn't. So we have digits '0' to '9'.\n\n        Step6: Count the frequency of each digit. Then count how many digits have odd frequency.\n\n        Step7: \n                if the number of digits with odd frequency <= 1 -> output \"First\"\n                else \n                    if the length of the string is even -> output \"Second\"\n                    else -> output \"First\"\n\n Implementation:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            long long N;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &N);\n\n            // Step1: compute ans1\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                long long q = N / i;\n                ans1 += i * q * (q+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            // Step2: compute ans2\n            long long ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3;\n\n            // Step3: convert ans2 to string\n            char s[25]; // enough for 20 digits\n            sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            // Step4: frequency array for digits (0-9)\n            int freq[10] = {0};\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {\n                    freq[s[i]-'0']++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step5: count the number of digits that have odd frequency\n            int odd_count = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                    odd_count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step6: decision\n            if (odd_count <= 1) {\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n            } else {\n                if (len % 2 == 0) {\n                    printf(\"Second\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"First\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n\n However, note: the third program condition for odd_count is exactly:\n\n            x = True\n            cnt = 0\n            for each frequency:\n                if frequency is odd:\n                    if cnt < 1: cnt++ -> so we allow one odd\n                    else: x = False and break.\n\n            So it breaks at the second odd. Therefore, odd_count must be at least 2 to set x to false.\n\n            But note: if we have three odds, then we break at the second odd? Actually, we break at the second odd and then don't check the third? \n            So the condition for x being false is: there is at least two odds? \n\n            Therefore, we can say: \n                if odd_count <= 1 -> x remains true -> output \"First\"\n                else (at least two odds) -> x becomes false -> then check the length.\n\n            So the above condition is correct.\n\n But note: the third program does not count all the odds? It breaks at the second one. However, the frequency count we did is over all digits. \n\n            The condition in the third program: \n                for key, value in dt.items():\n                    if value % 2 != 0 and cnt < 1:\n                        cnt += 1\n                    elif value % 2 != 0 and cnt >= 1:\n                        x = False\n                        break\n\n            This means: if we have two or more odd frequencies, then x becomes false. If we have exactly one odd frequency, then x remains true. If we have zero, then x remains true.\n\n            So we can also do:\n\n                if (odd_count <= 1) -> then x is true -> \"First\"\n                else -> then x is false -> then check the length.\n\n            Therefore, our code above is equivalent.\n\n One more corner: the third program sets x = True initially, then sets x = False only when it finds the second odd. \n\n            But what if there are more than two? Then we break and set x to false and we don't process the rest. But we don't need to: we only care if there is at least two.\n\n            Our method counts the total number of odds. Then we check: if the total number of odds is <= 1 -> then we didn't break? \n\n            However, note: the break happens at the second odd. So if there are two, then we break and set x to false. If there are three, we break at the second and set x to false.\n\n            Therefore, we don't care about the exact total if it is at least two. So we can break early too? But the problem does not require that. \n\n            However, we can also break early for efficiency (but the string is only 20 digits, so it's negligible).\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                int found_odd = 0;\n                int x = 1; // true\n                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                        if (found_odd < 1) {\n                            found_odd++;\n                        } else {\n                            x = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then:\n\n                if (x) {\n                    printf(\"First\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    if (len % 2 == 0) {\n                        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"First\\n\");\n                    }\n                }\n\n But the problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\". We can do either. However, the original breaks at the second odd. \n\n We'll do the early break to be faithful.\n\n However, note: the third program iterates over the keys in the dictionary. The dictionary keys are the characters that appeared. \n\n            But we are iterating over all 10 digits, even those that did not appear. That is inefficient? \n\n            We can instead iterate only over the characters in the string? But note: the frequency array for digits: we are only iterating 10 elements. \n\n            Alternatively, we can build a frequency map only for the digits that appeared? \n\n            But the original program does:\n\n                dt = {}\n                for char in s: \n                    dt[char] = dt.get(char,0)+1\n\n                then for key,value in dt.items():\n\n            So we are iterating over the distinct characters that appeared.\n\n            We can do the same: \n\n                We have the frequency array for digits. But note: the string is composed of digits. The distinct keys are the digits that have frequency>0.\n\n            We can iterate over the 10 digits and skip the ones with 0? But that would be the same as the original? \n\n            However, the original iterates only over the keys that are in the dictionary (i.e., the digits that appeared). \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                            if (found_odd < 1) {\n                                found_odd++;\n                            } else {\n                                x = 0;\n                                break;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But note: the original does not break on the first odd? It breaks on the second. \n\n            Actually, the original does:\n\n                for key, value in dt.items():\n                    if value % 2 != 0:\n                        if cnt < 1:\n                            cnt += 1\n                        else:\n                            x = False\n                            break\n\n            So it breaks at the second occurrence of an odd frequency.\n\n            We can do the same.\n\n However, the order of iteration: the original uses the order of the keys in the dictionary? But the condition does not depend on order. \n\n            We are iterating the digits from 0 to 9. The original iterates in arbitrary order (but in Python, dictionary iteration order is arbitrary? but in this case, the keys are digits and the order might be by the digit? Actually, in recent Python, the order is insertion order. \n\n            But we built the frequency by scanning the string. Then we iterate the dictionary: the keys are the distinct digits in the order of first appearance? \n\n            We are not required to have the same iteration order? The condition: we break at the second odd frequency, regardless of which digit it is.\n\n            So we can iterate in any order. \n\n            Therefore, we can iterate over the digits in the order of the string? But that is not necessary. \n\n            We'll do:\n\n                We'll build an array of the distinct digits that appeared? But it's easier to iterate over 0-9 and skip zeros.\n\n            Alternatively, we can create a list of the frequencies that are non-zero and then break at the second odd? But that is more complex.\n\n            Since there are only 10 digits, we can iterate 0-9 and check:\n\n                int found_odd = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] == 0) continue;\n                    if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {\n                        if (found_odd < 1) {\n                            found_odd++;\n                        } else {\n                            // found second odd -> set x to false and break\n                            x = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But note: the original breaks at the second odd in the iteration order. Our iteration order is 0 to 9. \n\n            However, the condition is: if we find at least two odds, then we break. The order doesn't matter for the condition.\n\n            So we can do.\n\n            But wait: what if the first digit we check has an odd frequency, then the next one we check has an even frequency, then the third has an odd? Then we break at the third? \n\n            Actually, we break only when we find the second odd? \n\n            How? \n\n                We start with found_odd=0.\n                We see an odd: found_odd becomes 1 -> no break.\n                Then we see an even: nothing.\n                Then we see an odd: we check: found_odd>=1 -> so we set x=0 and break.\n\n            That is the same as the original: we break at the second odd we encounter.\n\n            So it is independent of the order? The condition is: we break at the second odd we find.\n\n            Therefore, we can do.\n\n            However, the original program iterates over the distinct keys in the dictionary in an arbitrary order. But the condition is: if there are at least two odds, then we break at the second one we encounter. \n\n            So the result might be the same: if there are two or more odds, we break and set x to false. If there are less than two, we don't break and x remains true.\n\n            So we don't care about the order.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                int x = 1; // true\n                int found_odd = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] == 0) continue;\n                    if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {\n                        if (found_odd) {\n                            x = 0;\n                            break;\n                        } else {\n                            found_odd = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then use x.\n\n But note: the original does not break the loop when we set found_odd=1? It continues? \n\n            In the original, it only breaks when it finds the second odd. \n\n            Our loop breaks when we find the second odd? \n\n            So we break out of the loop as soon as we set x=0.\n\n            That is the same as the original.\n\n            If we don't break, we continue until the end.\n\n            So it's the same.\n\n Therefore, the final C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            long long N;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &N);\n\n            // Step1: compute ans1\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n                long long q = N / i;\n                // Note: the expression i * q * (q+1) might be huge?

We use long long for N, i, q, ans1, ans2.\n\n But note: the expression `i * q * (q+1) / 2` might be huge? \n\n        The maximum value of i*q*(q+1) might be about N * N * N? \n\n        For N=10^5: \n            When i=1: q = N, so term = 1 * 100000 * 100001 / 2 = about 5e9 -> which is within long long (max ~9e18).\n\n        So for N up to 10^5, the maximum term is about 5e9, and the total sum is about O(N^2 * log(N))? \n\n        But worst-case: the harmonic series: the number of distinct q is about O(sqrt(N)), so the loop can be optimized to run in O(sqrt(N))? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify constraints and the original code uses a loop from 1 to N. \n\n        If N is 10^5, then the loop runs 10^5 times -> acceptable in C.\n\n        But if N is 10^12, then we cannot run 10^12 iterations. \n\n        The problem does not specify constraints. We must assume the worst-case N? \n\n        However, the original Python program would be too slow for N=10^12. \n\n        So we assume that N is not too large? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\". \n\n        Therefore, we do the same naive loop.\n\n        But note: the problem might have intended an optimized solution? \n\n        However, the instructions say: \"Translate the entire sequence\".\n\n        We'll do the naive loop.\n\n        But we must use long long for N and the variables.\n\n        We'll change the loop to use a more efficient method? Only if the original Python was efficient? It was not.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            for (long long i = 1; i <= N; i++) { ... }\n\n        For large N (like 10^12) this will be too slow. \n\n        But the problem does not specify constraints. We'll assume that the input N is moderate. \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the sum can be computed by grouping by the value of q = N//i.\n\n        We know that q = N//i is constant for consecutive i.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for (long long i = 1, j; i <= N; i = j+1) {\n                long long q = N / i;\n                j = N / q;   // the last i such that N//i equals q.\n                // then for all i in [i0, j], the value of q is the same.\n\n                Then the term: \n                    T = [sum of i from i0 to j] * q * (q+1) / 2.\n\n                But note: the term for a fixed q is: \n                    term(i) = i * q * (q+1) / 2.\n\n                So the sum over the block: \n                    = (q * (q+1) / 2) * (sum of i from i0 to j)\n\n                The sum of i from i0 to j = (i0+j)*(j-i0+1)/2.\n\n            }\n\n        This reduces the number of iterations to O(sqrt(N)).\n\n        But the original Python code does a naive loop. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\", meaning same output for the same input? \n\n        And the naive loop in C might be too slow for large N? \n\n        We have two options:\n\n            Option1: Do the naive loop. It might be too slow for large N.\n\n            Option2: Optimize the loop. The original Python code was written naively, but we are allowed to change the implementation as long as the output is the same? \n\n        The problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\".\n\n        But note: the first program in Python uses a naive loop. We are to reproduce the same behavior. \n\n        If we do the optimized loop, the output will be the same? Yes, because we are computing the same sum.\n\n        And the problem does not specify that we must use the same algorithm? It says \"reproduce the same behavior\".\n\n        But the instructions say: \"Translate the entire sequence\".\n\n        Since the optimized loop is a well-known technique for this kind of sum, and it produces the same result, we can use it.\n\n        How to do:\n\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            for (long long i = 1, j; i <= N; i = j+1) {\n                long long q = N / i;\n                j = N / q;   // j is the largest index such that N//i == q.\n\n                // The block: [i, j]\n                // The number of terms: j-i+1\n                // The sum of i in the block: (i+j)*(j-i+1)/2\n\n                long long block_sum = (i+j) * (j-i+1) / 2;\n                ans1 += block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n        But wait: the original term for a particular i is: i * q * (q+1) / 2.\n\n        Then the entire block: \n            = (q*(q+1)/2) * (i + (i+1) + ... + j)\n            = (q*(q+1)/2) * block_sum\n\n        So the above is correct.\n\n        However, note: the original expression: i * q * (q+1) // 2.\n\n        We are doing: \n            block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2.\n\n        But note: division by 2: we are doing integer division. We must be cautious of the order of operations.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            long long term = block_sum * q;\n            term = term * (q+1);\n            term = term / 2;\n\n        But the original: for each i, we do: (i * q * (q+1)) // 2.\n\n        Since the entire block: the sum of the terms = (q*(q+1)/2) * block_sum.\n\n        But if we do: (q*(q+1)/2) * block_sum, then we are doing the division by 2 at the same time? \n\n        However, note: (q*(q+1)) might be even? Then /2 is integer. But what if it is odd? Then we are doing integer division.\n\n        But the original does integer division for each term? \n\n        Example: i=3, q=5: term = 3*5*6//2 = 3*30//2 = 90//2 = 45.\n\n        In the block: we do: block_sum * (5*6//2) = block_sum * 15.\n\n        But if we do: block_sum * 5 * 6 / 2, then that equals block_sum * 30 / 2 = block_sum * 15.\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            term = block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2;\n\n        This is the same as the sum of the individual terms.\n\n        So we can use the optimized loop.\n\n        Why? Because the original program might be too slow for large N? And we are allowed to change as long as the output is the same? \n\n        The problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\". The behavior is the output for the same input.\n\n        So we do the optimized loop.\n\n        Steps for the optimized loop:\n\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            long long i = 1;\n            while (i <= N) {\n                long long q = N / i;\n                long long j = N / q;   // j is the maximum index with the same q.\n\n                // Compute the sum of consecutive integers from i to j: \n                long long block_sum = (i + j) * (j - i + 1) / 2;   // note: (j-i+1) is the count\n\n                ans1 += block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2;\n\n                i = j+1;\n            }\n\n        But note: the division by 2 in block_sum: \n            The sum of integers from i to j is (i+j)*(j-i+1)/2.\n\n        This is integer? Because either (j-i+1) is even, or (i+j) is even? Actually, it is always integer.\n\n        Similarly, the other division by 2: block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2: \n            q*(q+1) is always even, so it is integer.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        We'll use the optimized loop to handle large N.\n\n        Now, the entire program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                long long N;\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &N);\n\n                long long ans1 = 0;\n                long long i = 1;\n                while (i <= N) {\n                    long long q = N / i;\n                    long long j = N / q;\n\n                    // Sum of consecutive integers from i to j\n                    long long block_sum = (i + j) * (j - i + 1) / 2;\n\n                    // The term for the entire block: block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2\n                    ans1 += block_sum * q * (q+1) / 2;\n\n                    i = j + 1;\n                }\n\n                long long ans2 = (ans1 * 2 + 1) / 3;\n\n                char s[25];\n                sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans2);\n                int len = strlen(s);\n\n                int freq[10] = {0};\n                for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                    if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {\n                        freq[s[i]-'0']++;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                int x = 1; // true\n                int found_odd = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] == 0) continue;\n                    if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {\n                        if (found_odd) {\n                            x = 0;\n                            break;\n                        } else {\n                            found_odd = 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if (x) {\n                    printf(\"First\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    if (len % 2 == 0) {\n                        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"First\\n\");\n                    }\n                }\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n Let me test with N=5:\n\n        i=1: q = 5/1=5, j = 5/5=1 -> block: [1,1]\n            block_sum = (1+1)*(1)/2 = 1.\n            term = 1 * 5 * 6 / 2 = 15.\n            ans1=15.\n\n        i=2: q=5/2=2, j=5/2=2 -> block: [2,2]\n            block_sum = 2.\n            term = 2 * 2 * 3 / 2 = 6.\n            ans1=21.\n\n        i=3: q=5/3=1, j=5/1=5 -> but wait, j should be min(N, N/q) but we set j=N/q -> then j=5/1=5 -> but we are at i=3? \n            Actually, we are grouping by q. For q=1, the i range is [3,5] because:\n                3: 5//3=1, 4: 5//4=1, 5: 5//5=1.\n            So j = 5/1 = 5.\n            block_sum = (3+5)*(5-3+1)/2 = (8*3)/2 = 24/2=12.\n            term = 12 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 12.\n            ans1=15+6+12=33.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we use the optimized loop.\n\n        Note: the while loop condition: i<=N.\n\n        We are done."
