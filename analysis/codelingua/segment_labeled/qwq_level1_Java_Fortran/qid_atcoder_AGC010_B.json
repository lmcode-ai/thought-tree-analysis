  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem seems to determine if a certain condition is met with an array of integers. The main function reads N and the array A, then calls the possible function, printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on its return.\n\nThe possible function calculates the sum of the array elements, checks if that sum is divisible by NS, which is N*(N+1)/2. If not, returns false. Then K is sum/NS. Then loops through each element, checking some condition involving the previous element (with wrap-around for the first element, which uses the last element). The conditions on d must be met for all elements; if any fail, return false, otherwise true.\n\nFirst, I need to port this logic into Fortran. Let's note differences between Java and Fortran:\n\nFortran arrays are 1-based by default. The Java code uses 0-based (since for loop starts at 0, i from 0 to N-1). So need to adjust indices. Wait, in Fortran, if I declare an array like integer :: A(N), then A(1) is the first element.\n\nFirst, the main program structure. In Fortran, the main would be a program block. The code uses a function called possible, which in Java is a static method. In Fortran, that would be a FUNCTION, possibly with some passing of variables.\n\nLet's think of steps:\n\n1. Read N and array A in Fortran.\n\nThe input in Java is via Scanner, so in Fortran, I can read with read(*,*) or similar. For the array, I can read N first, then read N integers into the array.\n\n2. Translate the possible function. Since Fortran subroutines and functions have different conventions, need to decide whether possible is a function returning a logical.\n\nYes, so FUNCTION possible (N, A) RESULT (res) ... then returns res as logical.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions must have types. So possible would be a FUNCTION possible returning a LOGICAL.\n\nBut also, the parameters in Fortran need to be passed correctly. The array A is an integer array of length N. So parameters would be, say, INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N, A(N). Wait, but in subroutines, you can have assumed-shape arrays, which is okay.\n\nNow, let's go through possible function step by step.\n\nThe variables sum and NS:\n\nsum is the sum of A elements. In Fortran, can use SUM intrinsic function.\n\nsum = sum(A) would be easier.\n\nWait, in Java, sum is a long, but in Fortran, since it's the sum of integers, if N is up to, say, 1e5, but in the problem constraints, but perhaps here it's okay. Wait, the possible function uses sum's value, but handles as long (64 bits). In Fortran, integers can be of type INTEGER(8) or similar for 64 bits if needed, but maybe the problem requires that. To stay compatible, maybe use 64-bit integers for sum, NS, K.\n\nIn Fortran declarations, we need to be careful with the types.\n\nFirst, to handle large numbers, perhaps define sum and NS as variables of kind=8 (or whatever kind is 64-bit). But in many compilers, SELECTED_INT_KIND can be used, but for simplicity here, assuming 64-bit integers, using INTEGER(8) where necessary.\n\nSo in the possible function, variables sum, NS, K are all 64-bit integers.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the variables:\n\nsum is a long (64 bits).\n\nNS is N*(N+1)/2, computed as (long)N*(N+1)/2, so using N as casted to long. In Fortran, if N is an integer, multiplying by (N+1) gives an integer. But since Fortran does not have overflow, but perhaps we can cast to 64-bit.\n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, variables sum and NS are 64-bit integers (kind=8), so in declarations, their types are specified accordingly.\n\nSo in possible function:\n\nFUNCTION possible (N, A) RESULT (res)\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N\n    INTEGER, DIMENSION(N), INTENT(IN) :: A\n    LOGICAL :: res\n    INTEGER(8) :: sum, NS, K, d, i, current, previous\n    ...\nend function\n\nWait, the looping variables: in Java, 'i' is from 0 to N-1. But in Fortran array A is 1-based. So when accessing A(1) to A(N), the loop would run from 1 to N, and for each i, the previous element is either A(i-1), but when i=1, it would be A(N).\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1 in Java, the j is set as (i==0 ? N-1 : i-1). Because in Java, the elements start at 0, so when i is 0, the previous is N-1 (since the last element is at index N-1).\n\nIn Fortran, since the elements are 1-based, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nj = (i ==1 ? N : i-1). Because for the first element (i=1), the previous element is N (since it wraps around); for i=2 to N, it's i-1.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    int j = i == 0 ? N -1 : i -1;\n    ... use A[i] and A[j]\n}\n\nIn Fortran, with 1-based arrays:\n\nfor i in 1 to N:\n\nj = (i ==1 ? N : i-1)\n\nSo the previous element is correct.\n\nNow, in the loop inside possible:\n\nCompute d = K - (A(i) - A(prev)), where prev is A(j). Wait, in Fortran code, the elements are A(i) and A(j) where j is previous index.\n\nWait in Java's code, for i from 0 to N-1, j is previous, so current element is A[i], previous is A[j].\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ncurrent = A(i)\n\nprevious = A(j) where j is as above.\n\nWait in Java code, the formula is d = K - (A[i] - A[j]). Wait that's (current element minus previous element) subtracted from K? Wait the formula is K - (A[i] - A[j]), so K minus ( current - previous ) equals (previous - current) + K ?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me see:\n\nd = K - (A[i] - A[j]), where A[j] is the predecessor. So yes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, for each element i from 1 to N, calculate the previous element's index j, then compute d as K minus (A(i) - A(j)).\n\nThen check if d is >=0 and mod(N) is zero.\n\nWait in the Java code's condition:\n\nif (d <0 || d%N !=0) return false.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (d <0 .OR. mod(d, N) /=0) then return false (res = .false.)\n\nSo need to loop through each i from 1 to N. Wait wait the Java code loops for all i from 0 to N-1 (which is N times, since N is inclusive), so in Fortran's 1-based, loops from 1 to N.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nFirst, translating the possible function first.\n\nPossible steps:\n\nInside the possible function:\n\nCompute sum as sum(A), cast A? In Fortran, when using the sum function, if A is integer, the default kind may be 4 bytes. Since Java used a long (8 bytes), perhaps the sum could overflow with 4 bytes, so maybe we should explicitly cast the elements to 8-byte integers first.\n\nThus sum = sum(A, kind=8) ? No, probably need to compute as:\n\nsum = sum( a , stat= ... )? Wait in Fortran:\n\nThe elemental function SUM can be used with an integer array. The default kind in SUM would be the same as the array unless specified. So if A is stored as integers of kind 4 (the default), then sum would be a 4-byte integer. To handle large N, perhaps we need to make sure that the sum is in a 64-bit integer.\n\nTherefore, in the code, perhaps convert each element to 8 bytes, then sum them.\n\nWait:\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nsum = 0_8\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   sum = sum + int( A(i), 8 )\n\nend do\n\nThis way, each A(i) is converted to integer(8), added to sum (which is also 8).\n\nThat ensures that even if A's elements are large, the sum is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the input numbers are in a smaller type, but converted to 8.\n\nAlternatively, in the main program, when reading the array A, store them as integer(8), so their sum can be correctly summed into sum (also 8).\n\nHmm. The original Java code uses int for array A. So the elements can be up to 2^31-1. So sum can be up to N * (2^31-1). If N is up to, say, 1e5, that would be way over 2^32, but in Java it's stored as long (64 bits), so okay. In Fortran, we need to handle sum as 64-bit integer.\n\nTherefore to prevent overflow, array A can be declared in Fortran as integer(8) as well, then sum is also 64.\n\nWait but the Java uses int for the array elements, which is okay for storing the values. The problem's constraints may not require the elements to be 64-bit. But since the sum can be up to N * MAX_INT (Java's A[i] is int), so sum needs to handle that. So in Fortran, store A as integer(8) is safest?\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran code, the array A is integer, but sum is computed as sum of elements, stored in integer(8).\n\nTherefore, the code for sum would be sum = sum( A(:), kind=8 ), but perhaps that is possible?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the SUM function of integers can be converted via a kind parameter. Wait, maybe I can write sum = sum( A ), but specify the kind, but the syntax might be different.\n\nWait, actually, Fortran's intrinsics are type-specific, so if A is an array of default integers, then SUM(A) will produce a default integer. To get a 64-bit sum, perhaps:\n\nsum = sum(A, kind=8). Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the better way is to perform the loop:\n\nsum = 0_8\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   sum = sum + A(i)\n\nend do\n\nThis way, sum starts as 8 and keeps adding integers. If the elements A are default integer, their values are promoted to integer(8) when adding to sum, which is okay.\n\nSo that's better.\n\nNow, then NS is (N*(N+1))/2, but in Fortran, N is an input integer (say default, but that's okay because N*(N+1) when added to 8, wait.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nNS = N*(N+1)/2. But in Java, we cast N to a long first, so using big enough integers here.\n\nIn Fortran, if N is the input as integer (default kind), then N*(N+1) could be larger than default integer (say 32 bits) for large N, but since in the code, we'll be storing NS into a integer(8) variable, then:\n\nNS is (N*(N+1))/2.\n\nBut in Fortran, if N*(N+1) is 4-byte, but then stored in an 8-byte variable, perhaps it's okay.\n\nWait, NS is computed as:\n\nNS = (N * (N + 1)) / 2.\n\nBut due to integer division, the order is important. Wait, in Fortran, when doing integer division, if it's not divisible, we have to make sure. The division is integer division, so we must have that N*(N+1) must be even. Which it is, because one of N or N+1 is even. So no problem.\n\nSo in code:\n\nYes, so in Fortran, the NS can be computed as:\n\nNS = (N * (N + 1)) / 2\n\nBut stored in integer(8) variable, so:\n\nsum is integer(8), NS is integer(8) as well.\n\nAfter that:\n\nIf mod( sum, NS ) ==0 then proceed.\n\nWait: if (sum mod NS .ne. 0) then return false.\n\nBut in code, the Java checks sum % NS !=0, which is equivalent.\n\nIf mod(sum, NS) /=0 return false.\n\nOtherwise compute K = sum/NS.\n\nSo K is sum / NS. Since we have ensured divisibility, the division is okay as an integer (integer division).\n\nNext part, the loop over each i from 1 to N (since N is the number of elements in 1-based array).\n\nFor each i in 1 to N:\n\nj is (if i ==1, N else i-1). (j is the previous element index).\n\nThen previous value is A(j).\n\nCompute d = K - (A(i) - A(j)).\n\nWait, that is d = K - (current - previous)\n\nWhich is equivalent to d = (previous - current) + K.\n\nWait the formula is exactly as in Java.\n\nNow, check two conditions:\n\nd <0 : if yes, return false;\n\nd mod N /=0: yes, return false.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nif (d <0) then return .false.\n\nOR if mod(d, N) /=0 then also.\n\nIn code, if any i causes either condition, return false.\n\nThus, loop over i, for each i do the check.\n\nSo:\n\ni starts from 1 to N.\n\nFor each i:\n\n   if i ==1 then prev = N else prev = i-1\n\n   current = A(i)\n\n   previous = A(prev)\n\n   d = K - (current - previous) \n\n   if (d <0 .or. mod(d,N) /=0) then \n\n      res = .false.\n\n      return \n\n   end if \n\nSo, exiting early as soon as any check fails.\n\nThus, the loop has to check all elements until a failure. Therefore, the loop in Fortran can start from i=1 to N, and break early if any case fails. As soon as one case fails, return false.\n\nNow, putting this all together in the possible function.\n\nNow also, the main program.\n\nMain program would:\n\nRead N.\n\nThen read N integers into array A (of size N).\n\nThen, check if possible(N,A) is .true. ?\n\nThen output 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nIn Fortran, variables:\n\nIn the main program, declare N as integer, A as integer array of size N. But since Fortran does not have dynamic arrays in older versions (like F77), but with F90 and above, it's allowed with allocatable arrays.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N first.\n\nThen allocate A as an array of size N.\n\nThen read the elements into A(1) to A(N).\n\nThen call possible function with N and A.\n\nThen write 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nAlternatively, using an assumed-size array but that may be more complex.\n\nWait let me see code structure.\n\nPossible program:\n\nprogram AGC010_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension ( : ), allocatable :: A\n\ninteger(8) :: ... ?\n\nLogical :: flag\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nallocate( A(N) )\n\nread(*,*) (A(i), i=1,N)\n\nflag = possible( N, A )\n\nif (flag) then\n\n   write(*, '(A)') 'YES'\n\nelse\n\n   write(*, '(A)') 'NO'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(A)\n\ncontains\n\nlogical function possible (N, A) result (flag)\n\nIntent(in) :: N, A\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: N\n\ninteger, dimension (:), intent(in) :: A\n\n... (same as before)\n\nend function possible\n\nend program AGC010_B\n\nBut first, need to make sure the subprogram possible is inside the program, either via module, external, or contained in the program. Here, using a contained function via 'contains'.\n\nWait in the main program:\n\nWe can put the function possible inside the program's 'contains' section.\n\nSo compiling that.\n\nNow, the function possible must be declared properly.\n\nInside the possible function, variables like sum is integer(8).\n\nWait let me detail the possible function:\n\nfunction possible(N, A) result(res)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: N\n\ninteger, dimension(N), intent(in) :: A\n\nlogical :: res\n\ninteger(8) :: sum, NS, K, d, current, previous\n\ninteger :: i, prev_j\n\nsum = 0_8\n\ndo i =1,N\n\n   sum = sum + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nNS = (N * (N+1)) / 2\n\nif ( mod( sum, NS ) /=0 ) then\n\n  res = .false.\n\n  return\n\nend if\n\nK = sum / NS\n\nres = .true.\n\ndo i=1, N\n\n   if (i ==1) then\n\n      prev_j = N\n\n   else\n\n      prev_j = i-1\n\n   end if\n\n   current = A(i)\n\n   previous = A(prev_j)\n\n   d = K - (current - previous) \n\n   if ( d <0 ) then\n\n      res = .false.\n\n      return\n\n   elseif ( mod( d, N ) /=0 ) then\n\n      res = .false.\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nreturn\n\nend function possible\n\nWait, but there are some possible issues here.\n\nWait variables current and previous in possible: since A is an array of integers (probably 4-byte), but in the code above, they are assigned to integer variables. But the expressions current - previous would be an integer (4-byte?), but d is integer(8), so when calculating 'current - previous', the difference is an integer (of kind ?). Wait the variables current and previous can be integer(4), but if their difference can be big, maybe d is okay.\n\nBut since d is computed as:\n\nd = k (integer(8)) minus (current - previous) (integer). So when subtracted, the integer is promoted to 8.\n\nWait yes.\n\nIn any case, since the variables current and previous can be of default integer.\n\nSo for the variables:\n\nprev_j is an integer index (to hold i-1 or N), so of type integer.\n\nNow let's check the assignments.\n\nWait, prev_j could be used as the index of A, which is okay as long as prev_j is in 1:N.\n\nWhen i runs from 1:N, then for i=1 prev_j is N (since i==1), so A(N) is valid.\n\nOther cases, prev_j =i-1 which is at least 0 when i=1.\n\nWait when i=2, i-1=1, etc., so all okay.\n\nAlso, in the loop, i starts at 1 to N, so prev_j is correct.\n\nNow, the NS = (N * (N+1))/2 can overflow as an integer?\n\nIn Fortran, if N is large (like 1e5, then N is stored as integer.\n\nWait if N is up to say 1e5, then N*(N+1) is about 1e10 which is within 32-bit integer (since MAX_INT for 32 bit is 2^31 ~2e9). Wait no! 1e5 squared is ~1e10 which is higher than 2e9. So for N=1e5, multiplied by N+1 would be 1e5*(1e5+1)= about 1e10, but 2e9 is 2^30, so 1e10 is way over 32-bit. So for N beyond 45,000 or so, it would overflow a 32-bit integer.\n\nThus in Fortran code, variables NS and sum need to be stored as 64-bit integers.\n\nWait in the code, NS is declared as an integer(8). So when N is large, the computation N*(N+1) will be done in integer(8)?\n\nWait, but in the calculation of NS = (N * (N+1))/2, if N is a default integer (kind 4), then N*(N+1) would be computed as an integer(4), then cast to integer(8), but that's bad because of overflow.\n\nAh, so that's an issue. So to avoid overflows, we must have the product N*(N+1) computed in 64-bit.\n\nThus to do that, N must be also considered as integer(8), or promoted to integer(8) in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, in the code, the calculation of NS must be done as:\n\nNS = int(N,8) * (int(N,8)+1) / 2\n\nYes.\n\nWait that's better.\n\nBecause N is an integer, say of default kind. Converting it to integer(8) first. So in code:\n\nNS = (int(N,8) * ( int(N,8) +1 )) / 2\n\nOtherwise, if N is too large, like 1e5, then N*N is 1e10 which exceeds 2^31 (the maximum for a 32-bit integer), leading to overflow.\n\nSo correcting that part is crucial.\n\nSo, to ensure that the product doesn't overflow, we first cast N to int64 (8 bytes) before multiplying.\n\nTherefore, in the code:\n\nNS = (N * (N+1)) / 2\n\nWill be incorrect for large N because N*(N+1) would overflow 32 bits. So the corrected code uses:\n\nNS = ( int(N,8) * ( int(N,8) + 1 ) ) / 2\n\nThus in the code:\n\nWithin the possible function:\n\ninteger(8) :: N_long, term1\n\nterm1 = int( N, 8 )\n\nNS = term1 * ( term1 + 1 ) / 2\n\nWait, but N is an input parameter, declared as integer. So perhaps better to cast there.\n\nAlternatively, let me recompute NS correctly as:\n\nNS = ( (N_8) * (N_8 +1 ) ) / 2 where N_8 = int(N,8).\n\nSo the code for that part would be:\n\ninteger(8) :: n_8 = int(N,8)\n\nNS = (n_8 * (n_8 +1 )) /2 \n\nSo in code:\n\nWithin possible function:\n\nn_8 = int(N, kind=8 )\n\nterm = n_8 * (n_8 + 1 )\n\nNS = term / 2 \n\nAlternatively, just:\n\nNS = ( int(N,8) * (int(N,8)+1)) / 2 \n\nThus that way, the product is computed in 64-bit integers.\n\nSo the code for NS is essential to fix.\n\nThus now, the corrected code for NS.\n\nThen, the possible function can handle very large N up to about 1e+9 or so.\n\nNow, putting all that together.\n\nAnother point is regarding the array A. in Fortran, if the array is declared as integer (the default), which is 4-byte, but when you read in the elements (which were int in Java), they should fit. But if the problem allows large integers, perhaps we need to use integer(8). However in the problem's possible function, only the differences are taken, so unless the numbers are up to 2^63, which is unlikely given the original problem is from programming contests.\n\nProbably the problem's constraints on the input values allows using integer(4) for the array. So the array can be declared as integer (default kind unless specified).\n\nSo, for the main program's A array:\n\nDAR Array A as:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n\ndeclaring it as default integers (integer kinds) is probably okay.\n\nBut let me check the problem's constraints. Looking back.\n\nThe problem is atcoder problem AGC010_B.\n\nWhat are the constraints? Since I don't have the problem statement, but since it uses 'possible' function, let's try to see.\n\nWait in the Java code's possible function, the array elements A are of type int.\n\nThus for code correctness, in Fortran, the elements must be integers within 32 bits, since the problem comes from an online judge. So unless stated otherwise, use default integers.\n\nNow, the code in the possible function. So the differences between current and previous elements would be up to 2^31 -1, but in d=K - (current - previous), and K is sum/ns.\n\nBut sum is computed as the sum of the N elements, each up to 2^31-1. Hence, for N, K can be up to (sum)/ns. For large N and large elements, K could be up to (N * (2^31)) / (N*(N+1)/2 ) ) = (approx) (2^31 * 2) / (N). So for N around 1e5, K would be ~ (2^31)/5e4 ~ which is still a large number but within 64 bits.\n\nSo yes, the code uses integer(8) for variables K, sum, NS, d.\n\nNow, putting this together.\n\nAnother point: The 'prev_j' variable can be of type integer, and the indices are handled correctly.\n\nWhat about loops?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all into code.\n\nAttempting full code:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGCO_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension( : ), allocatable :: A\n\nlogical :: result_flag\n\ninteger(8) :: sum_A, NS, K, d\n\ninteger :: i, j_prev, current_element, previous_element\n\nread (*,*) N\n\nallocate( A(N) )\n\nread(*,*) A\n\nresult_flag = possible(N, A)\n\nif (result_flag) then\n\n   print *, 'YES'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'NO'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(A)\n\ncontains\n\nlogical function possible(N, A)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: N\n\n    integer, dimension(N), intent(in) :: A\n\n    integer(8) :: sum_total, K_val, NS_val, d_val\n\n    integer :: i, prev_j\n\n    logical :: valid\n\n    sum_total = 0_8\n\n    !

Alternate way, but same ?\n\n    if ( mod( sum_total, NS_val ) .ne. 0 ) then\n\n        possible = .false.\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    K_val = sum_total / NS_val\n\n    possible = .true. ! assuming initially, unless found invalid\n\n    do i=1,N\n\n        prev_j = i-1\n\n        if (i ==1 ) then\n\n            prev_j = N\n\n        end if\n\n        current_element = A(i)\n\n        previous_element = A(prev_j)\n\n        d_val = K_val - ( current_element - previous_element )\n\n        ! Now, check d_val \n\n        if (d_val < 0 ) then\n\n            possible = .false.\n\n            return\n\n        end if\n\n        if ( mod( d_val, N ) .ne. 0 ) then\n\n            possible = .false.\n\n            return\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend function possible\n\nend program atcoder_AGCO_B\n\nWait, wait, in the NS_val calculation, the code I wrote there is:\n\nNS_val = ( (1_8 * N) * ( N +1 ) ) / 2 \n\nWait that's N as an integer (input), so 1_8 * N converts it to integer(8).\n\nAlternatively, as the second line I commented out.\n\nYes that's the better way.\n\nBut in the code above, in possible function, the prev_j is computed first, then current and previous.\n\nWait variables current_element and previous_element are declared as integers (default), so subtraction is okay?\n\nYes, but their difference can be an integer (32 bits?).\n\nYes, when stored in d_val which is 8-byte: K_val is 8 bits, so when subtracting (current_element - previous_element) (32 bit integer), the entire expression is stored as 8.\n\nSo that is correctly done.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the type of variables must agree in expressions. \n\nThe line:\n\nd_val = K_val - ( current_element - previous_element )\n\nK_val is integer(8), current_element and previous_element are integer. Thus, their difference is integer. That is added to K_val (integer(8)])-> the RHS is K_val (integer8) minus (integer). The integer is implicitly converted to integer(8), so the result is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow checking for any possible mistake.\n\nIn the main program's possible function, in the NS_val calculation:\n\nWait N is passed as an integer, which is the first parameter.\n\nThus using (1_8 *N) effectively converts N to integer(8), then multiplied by (N+1) which is integer.\n\nSo N+1 is integer, multiplied with integer(8), so the product is integer8.\n\nThus:\n\nNS_val = ( int(N,8) * ( N +1 ) ) / 2 \n\nis same as before, and correct. Therefore okay.\n\nAnother point: In the loop in possible over i from 1 to N.\n\nprev_j is first set to i-1, then if i ==1, it is set to N. So that is okay.\n\nTesting with small cases.\n\nExample case:\n\nLet's suppose a simple case where N=2.\n\nSuppose input is N=2, A = [2, 2]. Let's see:\n\nsum is 4.\n\nNS is 2*(3)/2=3. Sum =4.\n\nsum mod NS_val=4%3=1 \u22600 \u2192 returns false \u2192 so 4/3 is not integer. Thus the code would output NO.\n\nWait wait. Let me think.\n\nWait the possible function checks whether sum mod NS is zero. If not \u2192 false.\n\nHere, 4 mod 3 is 1 \u2192 thus returns false. Thus output 'NO'.\n\nBut what if A is [3,3], N=2.\n\nsum is 6 \u2192 mod 3 \u2192 0. Yes. Then K=6/3 =2.\n\nThen for each element:\n\ni=1: prev_j is 2. current A(1)=3, previous A(prev_j)=3.\n\nSo current - previous =0 \u2192 d_val = K - 0 = 2 \u2192 must be divisible by N=2 \u2192 2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 fine.\n\ni=2: i is 2 \u2192 prev_j =1 \u2192 A(2)=3, previous A(prev_j)=3 \u2192 current - previous is 0 \u2192 d_val=2 \u2192 same as before.\n\nThus conditions are met \u2192 possible returns true \u2192 output yes.\n\nAnother example:\n\nTake from Java code.\n\nWait maybe the problem is to check whether the array can be circularly decreased by K steps each time. Or something. So the conditions from the code is to pass all the array elements satisfying certain criteria.\n\nAnyway, considering the code's logic should be the same once translated.\n\nPotential mistake: the order of mod and division.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in one of the loops.\n\nAnother possible mistake: declare variables.\n\nWait the function possible returns a logical:\n\nAt the start possible = .true., then in the loop can return early:\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, should set possible = .true. and the first condition (sum mod NS) \u2192 then inside that, and if any loop step fails, possible is set to false and return.\n\nBut in the code above, after the first 'if (sum mod...)', then possible is assigned to .true., and then any failing condition inside the loop flips it to false and returns.\n\nWait in case where all conditions pass:\n\nThen returns possible remained as .true. after all steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that seems okay.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, mod(negative numbers):\n\nFor example, mod(-4, 3) is ... let me check.\n\nIn fortran, mod(a, p) is a - floor(a/p)*p \u2192 so mod(-4,3) is -4 - (-2)*3= -4 +6=2. So mod(-d_val, n) would be positive.\n\nWait but in the code, the condition is (d mod N) !=0 \u2192 which is okay, since if d <0 then it would be caught in first condition. So since first condition is 'if d_val <0 return false', then, mod( d_val, N) can be positive. But even so, if d_val is 5 mod 3 \u2192 5 mod3 is 2. But is mod(a,p) returns a value with the same sign as p?\n\nWait no, mod function in Fortran gives a remainder with the sign of the first argument. So for negative numbers:\n\nWait example:\n\nmod(-7, 3) \u2192 -7 divided by 3 \u2192 -2*3 \u2192 -6. The remainder is -7 - (-6) \u2192 -1. Thus mod(-7,3)= -1.\n\nWait, but for d_val <0, the first condition returns false. Therefore, once we have passed the first check, d_val must be >=0.\n\nHence in the second condition: mod(d_val, N) may be from 0 to (N-1).\n\nThus the check mod(d_val,N) ==0 \u2192 correct.\n\nTherefore the code is okay.\n\nSo the code should be correct, given the above steps.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nDid I have the array A correctly read?\n\nYes, in main program:\n\nAfter allocating A(N), read(*,*) A \u2192 that reads all N elements.\n\nThen possible function takes the array.\n\nThus all steps look okay.\n\nThus, this is the translated code."
