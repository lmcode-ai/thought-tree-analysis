  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by looking through the Java code to understand what it does. \n\nThe Java program takes two integers A and B from the user. Then it calculates some result based on those values. The formula seems to be (B-1) divided by (A-1), but using integer division. Then they check if there's a remainder, and if so, add 1 to the result. Finally, output the result.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, I need to read two integers, do the calculations, and write the result. \n\nFirst, how do I read input in Fortran? Well, typically using a read statement. Since it's from standard input, I can just use read(*,*) A, B. But I have to declare variables A, B, and the others as integers.\n\nNext, the variables: A, B, amari, and result are all integers. In Fortran, variable declarations are done with INTEGER :: list or similar. \n\nThe calculation: result is set to (B-1)/(A-1), but in Fortran, integer division is done with the / operator, but I need to make sure it's integer division. Wait, in Fortran, if both operands are integers, then / does truncating division. But maybe need to use the remainder from MOD or the quotient as per integer division.\n\nWait, the original Java code uses (B - 1) / (A - 1) for result, then the amari is (B-1) mod (A-1) mod in Java would be %, which is modulus. So in Fortran, MOD(B-1, A-1) gives the remainder. \n\nThen, if the remainder is not zero, the result is incremented by 1. \n\nSo putting this together in Fortran steps:\n\n1. Read A and B from input.\n2. Compute temp = (B-1)/(A-1) using integer division. \n3. Compute remainder = MOD(B-1, A-1). \n4. If remainder >0, then result is temp +1 else temp.\n5. Output the result.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the amari is the modulus, so if amari is non-zero, then we add one. \n\nNow in Fortran code structure:\n\nStart with program name, maybe same as Java, but in Fortran we can name it something like atcoder_ABC139_B. Need to make sure that's a valid name.\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC139_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: A, B, amari, result, temp\n  read(*,*) A, B\n  temp = (B-1)/(A-1)\n  amari = MOD(B-1, A-1)\n  if (amari /= 0) then\n    result = temp + 1\n  else\n    result = temp\n  end if\n  print*, result\nend program atcoder_ABC139_B\n\nWait, wait. Wait in the original code, the result is first set to (B-1)/(A-1). Then, if the remainder is not zero, add 1. So yes, exactly as above. \n\nWait but in Java, the division is integer division using / which truncates towards zero. Fortran's / for integers also does so. The modulus in Fortran's MOD function returns a remainder with the same sign as the divisor, so I need to be sure that the remainder is treated correctly. \n\nWait, in this problem scenarios, since A and B are probably positive? Because in the problem (since this is a programming contest problem, like ABC139 B), input constraints are important here. Let me think: assuming that A and B are integers greater than 1, so A-1 and B-1 are non-negative. Therefore, MOD should give a non-negative remainder.\n\nThus, the logic holds.\n\nWait in the code above, I used a temporary variable temp to hold (B-1)/(A-1), but actually in the original Java code, they compute result = (B-1)/(A-1). Then check if amari !=0, if so add 1. So the same structure here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can combine it into one line as result = (B-1 + (A-1) - 1 ) / (A-1), but not sure. Let me think: when there's a remainder, you need to round up. The formula for ceiling division can be written as (x + y -1)/y. Here, x is (B-1), y is (A-1). So (x + y -1)/y gives ceiling of x/y. Wait, but wait: original is (B-1) divided by (A-1), then add 1 if remainder.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose B-1 is exactly divisible by A-1: then remainder is zero \u2192 result is (B-1)/(A-1)\n\nIf there's a remainder, then the division gives floor(x/y) and remainder, so the result should be floor(x/y) +1. Thus, total is ceil(x/y). \n\nTherefore, the formula can be simplified to (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1). \n\nYes, so in that case, the code can be written without checking remainder. For example, x divided by y, rounded up.\n\nCeiling(x/y) is equal to (x + y -1)/y when x and y are positive.\n\nSo for x = B-1, y = A-1, then it's ( (B-1) + (A-1) -1 ) / (A-1) \u2192 (B-1 + A -2 ) / (A-1) = (A+B -3)/(A-1)\n\nBut maybe better to compute with the original approach here?\n\nBut the question is to translate the code as is, so perhaps better to do exactly the same steps?\n\nThe Java code does:\n\nresult = (B-1)/(A-1)\n\nif(amari !=0) then result +=1\n\nWhich is the same as ( (B-1 + A-2) )/(A-1)   ?\n\nWait let me check.\n\nLet x=5, y=3: (5 /3)=1, remainder 2 \u2192 result becomes 2.\n\n(5 +3-1)/3 \u2192 7/3 =2.333 \u2192 but integer division gives 2 \u2192 same. Hmm, with (x + y -1 ) / y gives ceiling.\n\nWait in that case, using (x + y-1)/y would give the same result as the code's approach. \n\nWait, let me test:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nx = B-1 = let's say 5\n\ny = A-1 = 3\n\nthen result initially is 1 (5/3 in integer division). remainder 2 !=0 \u2192 result 2.\n\nUsing (x + (y-1))/y \u2192 (5 +2)/3 \u21927/3 =2.333 \u2192 but integer division would give 2, same.\n\nWait no:\n\nYes, integer division in Fortran truncates. So (7)/3=2, but that's exactly the desired result.\n\nWait so maybe the whole code can be replaced with result = ( (B-1) + (A-2) ) / (A-1)\n\nWait ( (B-1) + (A-1 -1) ) = (B-1 + A-2) \u2192 (A+B -3). Divided by (A-1) gives the same as before.\n\nThus, perhaps the code can be written more concisely? However, since I'm translating the code as-is, not optimizing, I need to follow exactly the same steps. So better to do the initial approach.\n\nSo for Fortran code:\n\nDeclaring variables. Since all are integers. \n\nI think variables need to be declared. So the code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC139_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: A, B\n  integer :: amari, result, temp\n\n  read(*, *) A, B\n\n  temp = (B-1)/(A-1)\n  amari = mod(B-1, A-1)\n  if (amari /= 0) then\n    result = temp + 1\n  else\n    result = temp\n  end if\n\n  print *, result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC139_B\n\nWait but in the original code, the variable 'result' is declared but not temp. Wait in Java code, temp isn't used, but in the Java code, it's all done in one step.\n\nWait let's look again at the Java code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nresult = (B-1)/(A-1);\n\namari = (B-1) % (A-1);\n\nif (amari !=0) result +=1;\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can write directly:\n\nresult = (B-1)/(A-1)\n\namari = mod(B-1, A-1)\n\nif (amari /=0) then\n\n  result = result + 1\n\nend if\n\nSo perhaps temp is not needed. Let me see in the code: yes, the temp variable can be eliminated, and just set result to the initial value.\n\nThus, adjusting that in the Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC139_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: A, B, amari, result\n\n  read(*,*) A, B\n\n  result = (B -1) / (A -1)\n  amari = mod(B-1, A-1)\n  if (amari .ne. 0) then\n    result = result +1\n  end if\n\n  print*, result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC139_B\n\nWait but in Fortran 90, the .NE. is used as 'not equal', or can use /= operator.\n\nSo, using /= would be: if(amari /= 0) then.\n\nAh, yes, because in Fortran 90 and later, the intrinsic .ne. can be written as /=/, but sometimes people use \"==\". Wait no: in Fortran, the .ne. is the relational operator.\n\nHmm, so the code would be better to use .ne. or /=? The /= is a more modern form in Fortran 90.\n\nYes, so using /= is okay here. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but need to ensure that the code is compatible with the Fortran version expected. The problem didn't specify, but assuming F90+ is okay here.\n\nThus, that's better.\n\nWait also, in the print statement, the original Java uses a PrintWriter, but in Fortran, a simple print* statement to the standard output is enough.\n\nAlso, in the Java code, sc.close() is called, but in Fortran, that's not needed here. The input and output are handled through the file streams by default.\n\nSo this code should work. But let me check with some sample input.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 5\n\nThen, A =3, B=5\n\nCompute (B-1)=4, A-1=2.\n\nresult =4/2 =2, remainder 0 \u2192 so output is 2.\n\nAnother test case where B mod (A-1) leaves a remainder:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 4 \u2192 B=4 \u2192 B-1=3 \u2192 divided by 2 (3//2 is 1, remainder 1. Then result would be 1 +1 \u2192 2.\n\nAnother test case where A=2, B=3 \u2192 (3-1)/1= 2, remainder 0 \u21922. \n\nWait but what if A=2 and B=1?\n\nWait but probably the problem constraints don't allow that, but let's say B=1, so (0)/ (A-1=1) \u21920, but remainder 0. So output 0. Hmm, but maybe the code needs to handle edge cases, but since the code as written is a translation, it's okay.\n\nWait, original code may have scenario where A=1, but that would cause division by zero. So in the problem, I'm assuming A isn't 1 because that would crash the code. Probably the problem constraints specify A and B are within a certain range. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran translation seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: variable declarations. All variables must be declared. The code has A,B, amari and result declared as integers. \n\nYes.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as above."
