  "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. \n\nFirst, the code reads some inputs: n, m, x. Then, it initializes a 2D array a of size n by m+1. It reads the values for this array. Then, there's a loop iterating up to 2 to the power n. For each iteration, it creates a status array indicating which elements are selected (like a bitmask). Then it calculates the sum of the selected rows in the array res. It checks if each element after the first in res meets or exceeds x, and if so, keeps track of the minimum cost (res[0]). Finally, it outputs the minimum or -1 if none found. \n\nHmm, Fortran arrays are a bit different. Let's think about the variables first. Java uses 0-based indices, but in Fortran, arrays can start at 1, but I can declare them starting at 0 if necessary, though might need to adjust.\n\nThe main challenge is handling loops and arrays correctly. The bitmask loop in Java iterates over all subsets of the books (since n is the number of books?), so each subset represents selecting some books.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nStart with input reading. In Fortran, we usually use a read statement. The Scanner in Java is replaced with something like read(*,*) for standard input. \n\nFirst line reads n, m, x. Then min is initialized to some large value. In Java it's Integer.MAX_VALUE, which in Fortran we need to use a large integer, maybe 2147483647?\n\nThe array a: Since the loop for initializing the array a goes up to m+1 (the inner j runs to <= m), so in Fortran it would be dimensioned as (n, 0:m)? Wait, indices: the Java code uses from j from 0 to m, so in Fortran, maybe declare it as (0:n-1, 0:m) perhaps? Wait, in Fortran arrays, the first subscript is rows, second columns. In the Java code, the first index is from 0 to n-1 (since i runs from 0 to n), and the second from 0 to m. So perhaps in Fortran, declare integer, dimension(n, m+1) :: a. Wait, but in Fortran, by default, arrays start at 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the Java code, a has indices [n][m+1], since for each row i (0..n-1), columns 0 to m. So in Fortran, perhaps dimension a(n, 0:m). Wait, but you can start subscripts at zero if you specify with (/ ... /). Alternatively, since Fortran typically starts at 1, maybe it's better to shift the indices. Alternatively, use a different strategy. Alternatively, just use 1-based arrays, but then adjust all the loops.\n\nWait maybe to save effort, better to use 0-based in Fortran? Let me see: You can set the lower bound explicitly. For example, arrays in Fortran can have any lower bound. So for the 2D array a, if I do something like:\n\ninteger, dimension(n, 0:m) :: a\n\nThen the second index starts at 0. \n\nHmm, but I need to make sure when declaring the array. Alternatively, perhaps adjust the indices to start from 1. Then, the loops would adjust accordingly. For example, in the Java code, the k goes from 0 to m. In Fortran, if we have a second bound starting at 1 to m+1, then the first column becomes res[0], and other columns from 1 to m. That might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use 1-based indices throughout, adjusting the loops. Let me think.\n\nWait let me first outline all the steps and variables.\n\nVariables:\n\nJava's variables:\n- n is the number of books (probably)\n- m is the number of subjects (maybe), since there are m+1 columns (since the loop for j goes 0 to m). The first column is the cost of the book (so a['cost'] is j=0?), and then the subsequent columns (j=1 to m) are the understanding in each subject.\n\n- x is the required minimum understanding.\n\nThe code:\n\nreads n, m, x (so in Fortran, read(*,*) n, m, x)\n\nthe array a is n rows, m+1 elements each. \n\nThen for each row i from 0 to n-1, read m+1 numbers into a[i][0...m]\n\nThe next loop goes up to Math.pow(2,n). Because it's checking all possible subsets (each bit represents whether the ith element is selected).\n\nThen for each subset, the status array is set to 1 for the bits that are set. \n\nWait, in Java, the code uses bits to represent selected books, stored in the status array, and loops over each book to check if selected. \n\nHmm, maybe the status array in Fortran can be an array of bits, but in Fortran, we might have to represent that as an integer array or other.\n\nAlternatively, in each iteration i of the loop (from 0 to 2^n -1), the status is determined by the bits of i. For each bit j (0-based from 0 to n-1). The line says status[j] = 1 if (1 & (i >> j)) ==1. That right bit shift. \n\nWait, (i >> j) gives the value after moving the bits to the right by j places. So the least significant bit of that would be the j-th bit of i. Wait, perhaps a better way to think is: For each bit j in a binary number i, the mask (1 << (n-1-j)) or such? Hmm the code checks if the bit j (starting from the LSB side?) is set. Wait the code uses (i >> j) & 1 would give the j-th bit (since shifting right by j, then AND with 1). So the original bit j of the number i is stored in status[j].\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the bitten can be checked using bit functions. Since Fortran 90 has bitwise functions.\n\nWait maybe in Fortran, for each number i (integer) representing a subset, the bits are checked for each bit in 0 to n-1. \n\nWait, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < Math.pow(2,n); i++){\n\nThis goes up to 2^n-1. But in Fortran, when using integers in loops, you can compute 2**n, but since n can be up to as big as? Let me see, in a problem like this, constraints for n would probably be up to like 20 or 30, given that 2^30 is way too big, so maybe the code is manageable for n<=20? Well, the Java code would have a problem if n is 30, as 2^30 is over million. But maybe the problem has constraints. \n\nBut in any case, in Fortran, the equivalent loops can be written using DO loops. The second part:\n\nfor (int j=0; j <n ; j++){\n\nThen check whether bit j of i is set, then status[j] is 1. \n\nHmm so in Fortran, for integer i, each bit position can be tested via bit shifts and AND. \n\nIn Fortran, bitwise operations are available with functions like IBITS to get bits, or shifting with RSHIFT and LSHIFT, and &B is the bitwise AND.\n\nWait, better:\n\nTo check if the j-th bit is set in i:\n\nif ( BTEST( i, j ) ) then ... \n\nYes, that's simpler. The BTEST function returns .true. if the bit is set. So j here is 0-based from least significant bit.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop over bits can be:\n\ndo j = 0, n-1\n\n    if ( BTEST( i, j ) ) then --> status is 1 for that bit.\n\nSo, perhaps in Fortran code, the status can be represented by an array of integers, each 0 or 1 for each book selected. \n\nWait, but maybe for efficiency, we can avoid storing the status array, but rather directly check the bits. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, arrays start at 1, the variables may need to be adjusted. Let me plan:\n\nFirst, in Fortran code.\n\nThe code outline would be:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nAllocate the array a (n, m+1). Wait, in Fortran, we can do it with dynamic allocation or fixed size? Since we have to read input at runtime, variables n, m are known after reading, so do we need arrays declared with allocatable status. \n\nHmm, so in Fortran, perhaps like this:\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, x, min_cost\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: a\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: status\n\nBut then:\n\nRead(n, m, x) from user.\n\nAllocate the array a(n, m+1). Wait, in Fortran, the second dimension would be 0 to m? Or is it m+1 elements? For the first dimension, assuming that the books are 1 to n, maybe indexing from 1. Hmm so in the loops:\n\nIn the original code, the i runs from 0 to n-1 (i <n), and j from 0 to m, since it loops \"for(j=0 ;j<=m ; j++)\".\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can have a loop over i from 1 to n, and for each of those, j from 1 to m+1 (but since first index's j is 0 in the Java code, perhaps the first column in m+1 is the cost. So in Fortran, maybe a is a(n, m+1), so that columns (j in Fortran) are 1 to m+1. Thus, the first column (j=1) would be analogous to a[i][0] in Java, but this might be confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use indices in Fortran starting from 0 to m. To do that, in Fortran, when declaring the array:\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1, 0:m))\n\nBut since Fortran arrays can have any lower bounds. So after reading n, m, x, we do allocate(a(n=0:n-1, m=0:m)) ?\n\nWait in Fortran it's declared as, for example:\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1,0:m))\n\nYes. Then the indices will align with the Java code.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's easier, because then all loops can be directly adjusted.\n\nSo, let's plan to:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1,0:m)) \n\nThen read each row:\n\ndo i=0 to n-1\n\n    do j=0 to m\n\n        read (sc.nextInt() \u2192 in Fortran, we need to read all the numbers in one go. Wait, in the Java code, the inner loop for the a array is reading each number in a row. So in Fortran, perhaps using read(*,*) a( i, 0:m) \u2192 but to read all numbers in a row line by line.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the user input would come as:\n\nRead n, m, x\n\nThen, for each of the n books, read (m+1) integers, setting a(i,j) for j from 0 to m.\n\nAssuming each book's data is on its own line.\n\nBut perhaps the input has all numbers space-separated. In any case, in Fortran, to read all the entries of the array a, after the first set of inputs:\n\ninteger :: temp_var\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   do j =0, m\n\n      read*, temp_var\n\n      a(i,j) = temp_var\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, use read( *, fmt=... ) perhaps.\n\nWait but in Fortran, reading a 2D array is a bit more involved. Maybe using a loop. \n\nOkay, moving on. Then, the outer loop for i in the Java is from 0 up to 2^n -1. So in Fortran, the equivalent is:\n\ndo i_fortran = 0, 2**n -1\n\nWait, integer. But then, care needs to be taken for integer overflow, but in the problem's context, n might be <=20. Let's see, 2^20 is about a million, which is acceptable for loops. \n\nInside this loop for each subset:\n\nInitialize a status array (or, perhaps, test bits directly) for each of the n elements. \n\nIn the Java code, status array is an array of integers (0 or 1), where status[j] is 1 iff the j-th element is selected (since the loops over j from 0 to n-1). \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can avoid the 'status' array and directly check the bits as we loop over the books.\n\nNext, in calculating the res (array representing sum of selected books' contribution). \n\nThen, sum each of the selected books' a[j][k] for each subject.\n\nThen check if each of the subjects (indexes 1 to m) is >=x. \n\nOnce all conditions are met, compute the total cost (res[0]) and compare with min.\n\nSo in steps:\n\nInitialize min_cost to a high value (like 2147483647). \n\nStart loops over subsets (i = 0 to 2**n -1 )\n\n   For each subset represented by i, compute the sum for each subject (and cost)\n\n   To compute the sum:\n\n   res array (indexes 0 to m) initialized to 0, then add a[j][0,...m] for each selected book j.\n\nWait the res in java is an array of m+1 elements, which in Fortran can be dimensioned (0:m).\n\nSo declare a temporary array res(0:m) = 0\n\nThen, loop over each book j (from 0 to n-1), and if the j-th bit of x is set (i using BTEST( i_fortran, j ) ), then add their a's columns to res.\n\nAlternatively, even better, loop over each of the books, check if the bit is set, and add their a[j,0..m] into res.\n\nWait, the loop over books can be done as:\n\nres(:) = 0\n\ndo j = 0, n-1\n\n   if ( BTEST( i_fortran, j ) ) then \n\n      res(0:m) = res(0:m) + a(j,0 : m)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since a is a 2D array, the line res(0:m) = res(0:m)+ a(j,0:m) would require the a(j,0:m) is a slice. In Fortran, that works when a is a 2D array. For instance, yes, the slice notation a(j,0:m) would give the entire row. Wait, no: in Fortran, j is the row, first index. So for example, a(j, 0:m) is the j-th row's elements from column zero to m.\n\nYes. So that line is correct. \n\nThen, after computing res, check for all subjects (indices 1 to m) that res(s) >=x.\n\nSo:\n\nflag = .true.  --> a logical variable (boolean)\n\ndo s=1 to m \n\n   if res(s) <x \u2192 flag = false, exit.\n\nend do\n\nIf flag is still true after the loop, then check if the cost (res(0) ) is less than min_cost. \n\nSo if (flag), set min_cost = min( min_cost, res(0) )\n\nOnce the loop over all subsets is done, print accordingly. \n\nNow, in Fortran variables:\n\nWe need to have variables: n, m, x, min_cost (initialized to a large number).\n\nWe can use kind=4 for 32-bit integers to match Java's int (since the problem may require that integers are up to Integer.MAX_VALUE which is 2^31-1, but in some cases, Fortran integers may be 4 bytes (kind=4), so to ensure, use integers for variables n, etc. \n\nNow putting all together:\n\nFortran version steps:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC167_C\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, x, i, min_cost=2147483647  ! initialized to max\n\n    ! Declare array a as allocatable in 2D, dimension (0:n-1, 0:m), but n and m are variables, so must be after reading.\n\n    ! So we need to read n and m first.\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:,:), res(:) \n\n    logical :: flag\n\n    ! Read n, m, x\n\n    read *, n, m, x\n\n    ! Allocate a as (n rows x (m+1 columns)), indices 0 to n-1, 0 to m.\n\n    allocate(a(0:n-1,0:m), res(0:m))\n\n    ! Read the a array:\n\n    do i =0, n-1\n\n        read *, a(i,0:m)   ! each row has m+1 numbers, stored in a(i,0) to a(i,m)\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now loop over all subsets (from 0 to 2^n -1 ) \n\n    do i=0, 2**n -1\n\n        res=0 ! initialize the res array to zero for this subset\n\n        ! For each book j, check if it's included:\n\n        do j=0, n-1\n\n            if( btest( i, j ) ) then \n\n                res(0:m) = res(0:m) + a(j,0:m)\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        ! Now check if all subject (1 to m)are >=x\n\n        flag = .true.\n\n        do s =1, m\n\n            if( res(s) <x ) then\n\n                flag = .false.\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        ! If all sufficient:\n\n        if( flag ) then\n\n            !compare res(0) with min_cost\n\n            if( res(0) <min_cost ) then\n\n                min_cost = res(0)\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! After all iterations:\n\n    if( min_cost ==2147483647 ) then \n\n        print *, -1\n\n    else \n\n        print *, min_cost\n\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(a, res)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the loop over subsets, when n is large (like up to 20), 2^20 is around a million, which is manageable. But if n is larger, that's a problem, but the code is as per the original. \n\nWait in the original Java code, they loop up to Math.pow(2, n), which is 2^n. So from 0 to 2**n -1, which is what I have in the loop.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nLet me see edge cases. For example, when no subset meets the condition. \n\nBut in code, the min remains at 2147483647, which is correct, then outputs -1.\n\nAnother note: the 'res' array is declared as allocatable, but since m can be up to any problem limit, perhaps it's better to have the allocation after n and m are read. Since in the code above, the res is initialized after reading m, so it's okay.\n\nBut when m is zero? Hmm unlikely, since m is a constraint. \n\nAnother point: in the book loops, Fortran loops use colons, so for:\n\nDO j =0,n-1 ... ENDDO.\n\nWait in the loops, in code above, the initial read of a is done correctly, as lines. \n\nWait when I read a(i,0:m) \u2192 the entire row.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read into an array slice like a(i,0:m), each row is read in one line with m+1 numbers. \n\nYes. But in the original Java, it's using nextInt() in a for loop, so for each row and each element. So in the Fortran version, the total number of numbers input should be correct. \n\nSo for each row, it's correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, is it allowed to have \"allocate(a(0:n-1,0:m))\"?\n\nYes, when using allocatable arrays. Similarly with the res array is allocated (but since it's size m+1, perhaps the res can be just declared as res(0:m). Hmm. The allocate for res is done here before the loop, but the m is known when allocation happens because n and m have been read first.\n\nWait, the code I wrote above allocates 'res' with allocation of (0:m). So when the program reads m first (in the read n m x step), the res array's dimension is properly known. \n\nWait, the variables res should have from 0 to m \u2013 yes. \n\nWait, and 'res' could be a simple array without allocation if declared as dimension(m), but it's okay to declare it as allocatable. \n\nWait, perhaps I can make 'res' a normal array with a fixed size, but since m is input at runtime, the allocation is needed. Hence the current code's approach is correct.\n\nAnother note: in the code, the 'status' array is not needed. The code directly loops over each j and checks the bits using BTEST.\n\nAnother thing: in the book loops for res computation, instead of using the status array, compute it on the fly. Which is better for performance, but the code is correct as is.\n\nNow, possible errors.\n\nWait when taking 2**n: in some cases, especially when n>29, the result might exceed the integer limit. But in the problem constraints, since we need 2^n to be manageable (as per the original Java code), so assuming that n is small, like up to 20 or 30. Let me see: 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable on a modern computer but 2^30 is a gig, which is way too big. So perhaps in the problem constraints, n is small enough for the loops to work.\n\nAnother possible issue: the loop variable 'i' in Fortran. \n\n The loop is DO i_fortran = 0, 2**n -1 ... ENDDO\n\nWait, but in the code code above, I wrote:\n\ndo i=0, 2**n -1, but here 'i' is a variable. So in Fortran, integer i must be large enough to hold 2^n -1. \n\nWait, an integer variable in Fortran with kind=4 can hold up to about 2e9, but 2^31 is about 2.1e9.\n\nTherefore, if n is up to 30, 2^30 \u2248 1e9, so an integer can hold 2^30-1.\n\nWait a 32-bit integer can store up to 2^31-1. So 2^30 is manageable. Up to n=30.\n\nSo it's okay. \n\nSo, that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the lines where 'res(0:m) = res + a(j,0:m)', \n\nBut in Fortran, array assignment is element-wise. So if 'a(j,0:m)' is a vector, then res will be increased correctly by adding to each element. Yes.\n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, final code. Wait, also note that in Fortran, colons are used for array slices. For example, a(j,0:m) is correct.\n\nNow, compiling possible Fortran:\n\nOne thing is that in the allocate statement, the lower bound can be maintained.\n\nFor the a array, doing allocate(a(0:n-1, 0:m)), and accessing with a(i,j) where i 0-based.\n\nThe same for res, since res(0) is okay because declared from 0:m.\n\nThe rest seems okay.\n\nAnother possible error is when m is zero? The original code probably requires m>=1 because x is required for m subjects. But the problem likely has m>=1.\n\nTesting the code with example. Let's take sample input.\n\nWait say input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 250\n\n100 1 1 1 1\n\n200 2 2 2 2\n\n300 3 3 3 3\n\nBut n=3, m=3, so each book has 4 columns (0 to3). \n\nThe code should find which combinations give sum >=250 in all 3 subjects.\n\nEach book's understanding:\n\nFirst book (index 0):\n\nsubject 1:1, subject2:1, etc. Total for three books:\n\nif all three are taken, sum of each subject is 6, which is over 250? No, wait 1+2+3? \n\nWait in this example, the first book's cost is 100, and the four columns are [100,1,1,1] \u2192 so the first is cost (0 column) then each subject.\n\nWait the second book (index 1) has columns 200 2 2 2, so cost 200 and subjects 2,2,2.\n\nThird book has 300,3,3,3. \n\nIf you take all three books, sum for subjects would be 1+2+3=6 for each subject. Wait 6 is way below 250, so that\u2019s not good. Hmm, maybe this isn't a good sample. Let me make a better example.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the required x is 5, m is 2, and we have:\n\nn=2\n\nm=2\n\nx=5\n\nEach book gives:\n\nBook1 has cost 10, and subject scores 3,2.\n\nBook2 has cost 20, scores 2,3.\n\nThen to meet x=5 in both subjects (total after selected books):\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n- Both books: total cost 30. total subjects: 5 and5. \u2192 which meets. \n\nHence min is 30. \n\nAnother subset: book1: gives 3 and2 \u2192 nope. \n\nBook2: 2 and 3 \u2192 no.\n\nThus the correct minimum is 30. Let me see if the code would return that.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nAfter reading 2,2,5 \u2192 loops over i from 0 to 3 (since 2^2=4).\n\nFor i=3 (binary 11 both selected):\n\nres(0)=10+20=30.\n\nres(1)=3+2=5, res(2)=2+3=5. \n\nThen the flag is true, so min becomes 30.\n\nOther subsets won't, so the code would work.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should handle this example.\n\nSo the code looks okay.\n\nThe only thing left is the code structure. The original code is a main function, but in Fortran the program is main.\n\nFinal code in Fortran:"
