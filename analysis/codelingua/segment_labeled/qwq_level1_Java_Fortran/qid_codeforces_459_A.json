  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, the code is for solving some problem, probably from Codeforces. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe main method reads four integers x1, y1, x2, y2. Then there are condition checks. Let me read each condition:\n\nFirst condition: if x1 and x2 are the same (vertical line). Then it calculates dif as the absolute difference between y's. The output is (x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2). That seems like extending from the current x coordinate, moving in x direction by dif, creating a rectangle or a line?\n\nSecond condition: if y1 and y2 are same. Then dif is the x difference. So outputs coordinates of points adding dif to y. Maybe forming a rectangle where the side extends upwards? \n\nThird condition: if the absolute x difference is equal to the absolute y difference (so it's a diagonal). Then swap y coordinates? Like making a square? Outputs x1 y2 and x2 y1? \n\nElse, output -1. So the code is trying to find some four points maybe forming a specific shape?\n\nNow translating this into Fortran. Let's see.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the input and output would be handled via read and write statements. Since it's a program, we need to structure the code accordingly. Also, the logic is the same, but the syntax is different. \n\nFirst step: Declare variables. In Java, they're integers. In Fortran, variables need to be declared with types. So variables x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers. Let's see all variables: dif as well, used in some conditions. \n\nThe main steps would be:\n\n1. Read the four integers.\n2. Check conditions and compute accordingly.\n\nStarting the program:\n\nProgram codeforces_459_A\nImplicit None\nInteger :: x1, y1, x2, y2, dif\n! code here\nEnd Program codeforces_459_A\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. Also, explicit None ensures that variables must be declared.\n\nNow, input: how to read four integers? Using read(*,*) statement.\n\nRead(*,*) x1, y1, x2, y2\n\nNow, the condition in the first part of Java is:\n\nif (x1 == x2) {\n compute dif = abs(y1 - y2)\n print the line (x1 + dif, y1) etc.\n}\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (x1 == x2) then\n   dif = abs(y1 - y2)\n   write(*,*) x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\nelse if ... \n\nSimilarly for other conditions.\n\nWait, the first part: the print statement in Java uses a PrintWriter. But in Fortran, we can do straightforward write statements.\n\nWait let me check the first case's output: it prints four numbers separated by spaces. The code inside the first conditional is:\n\nSystem.out.println(...)\n\nWhich in Fortran would be write(*,*) \n\nBut the Java code builds a string from the four values. So for example, (x1 + dif) + \" \" + y1 etc. So in Fortran it would be writing those four integers with star formatting which should put spaces between.\n\nNow the second else-if is when y1 equals y2. So then dif is abs(x1 - x2). Then the output is:\n\nx1, y1 + dif, then x2 (which is first's x2?), then (y2 + dif). Wait in Java code:\n\ny1 + dif: since y1 and y2 are same here. Wait wait: in the second condition, y1 == y2. So in that case, the output is \"x1 \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + x2 \" + (y2 + dif). Wait, but x2 is original?\n\nWait the Java code for the y1==y2 case: \n\npw.println((x1) + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + (x2) + \" \" + (y2 + dif));\n\nWait note that y2 is same as y1 here, so the two y terms after adding dif would be same. Let me see: \n\noriginal points (x1,y1) and (x2,y1). So when direction is horizontal (same y), then they extend upwards by dif. So the output would be the two new points? \n\nIn any case, Fortran code for the second condition:\n\nelse if (y1 == y2) then\n   dif = abs(x1 -x2)\n   write(*,*) x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif\nend if\n\nHmm, but wait, in the code's output, the first two coordinates (the first point?) and the third and fourth are the second point?\n\nWait the code's original Java code outputs four numbers in order, so the first pair is a point, the next pair another point? So that line gives four coordinates. So the Fortran write needs to do the same. \n\nThird condition: if the absolute difference in x is same as the absolute difference in y, then output x1, y2, x2, y1. \n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nelse if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) then\n   write(*,*) x1, y2, x2, y1\nelse\n   write(*,*) -1\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, the abs function is ABS, and for integers, it's same.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, conditional expressions must be careful with the syntax. The expression for condition three:\n\nif (abs(x1 - x2) .eq. abs(y1 - y2)) then\n\nAh, because in Fortran, equality for integers can be .eq., but also should use .eq. in the if condition.\n\nNow putting all pieces together. \n\nNow, let's also consider that in the first case (x1 == x2), the dif is the vertical distance between the two points. So adding that to x1, so moving horizontally by that distance? Or wait, in Java, it's x1 + dif. So for example, if the two points are (2,3) and (2,5), that's vertical line, y difference 2. Then dif = 2, so x1 + dif would be 2 +2 =4, so the output is (4,3), (4,5). So the new line is horizontal?\n\nHmm, that's making a perpendicular... Anyway, the code's behavior is as per the Java's logic. So just code as per that.\n\nNow possible edge cases. Like if x1 and x2 are the same, but the dif is negative? But ABS ensures it's positive, so it's okay.\n\nFortran's write statement uses *, which would output with spaces, which is okay. The PrintWriter in Java also outputs with spaces. \n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the PrintWriter is closed at the end. In Fortran, since we are using write and read directly, no need to close anything? Or maybe the end of program takes care of it. So that can be omitted in the Fortran code.\n\nConstants: the \"println\" in Java adds a new line. The Fortran write also goes to a new line, since it uses write(*,*) which outputs each data separated by blanks, and then new line.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nProgram codeforces_459_A\nImplicit None\nInteger :: x1, y1, x2, y2, dif\n\nRead(*,*) x1, y1, x2, y2\n\nIf (x1 == x2) Then\n   dif = ABS(y1 - y2)\n   Write(*,*) x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\nElse If (y1 == y2) Then\n   dif = ABS(x1 - x2)\n   Write(*,*) x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif\nElse If (ABS(x1 - x2) == ABS(y1 - y2)) Then\n   Write(*,*) x1, y2, x2, y1\nElse\n   Write(*,*) -1\nEnd If\n\nEnd Program codeforces_459_A\n\nWait, but let me check the third condition again. The third condition says when the differences in x and y are same in absolute terms. Then we output the current points swapped y's? \n\nFor example, if original points are (0,0) and (1,1), then the difference is 1 in both. So swapping y gives 0 1 and 1 0? Wait no, the output is x1, y2 and x2, y1. So for (0,0) and (1,1), it becomes (0, 1) and (1, 0). Which are different points. Not sure if it's correct but according to the Java code's logic, that's what it does.\n\nSo that's the correct code. Let me double-check all variables needed: x1, y1, x2, y2, and dif are all declared as integers. \n\nWait, in the second case: the dif is the absolute of x difference. Then, when adding to y1 and y2 (since y1=y2 there), so the new coordinates have added the horizontal difference to the y-coordinate. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't mix up x and y there. The second case handling:\n\nif (y1 == y2), the line is horizontal. The code adds the difference in x (since abs(x1 -x2) is the length)\n\nSo when the line is horizontal (same y), we are moving in vertical direction (y) by that difference. So resulting points are (x1, y1 + dif ), (x2, y2 +dif). So new points have the same x as original, but y increased, forming a vertical line? \n\nAlternatively, that makes a rectangle perhaps?\n\nNow in code's first case, if the original line is vertical (x same), then adding the y difference (vertical length) to the x coordinate. So the new line is horizontal at x = x1 + dif, same y coordinates as before, making a horizontal line? \n\nI think that's what the code is doing. \n\nNow code structure in Fortran should be okay.\n\nWait: In the first case, \"x1 + dif\" is written twice? Yes.\n\nAnother possible error: in the second else if, the code uses y2 +dif, which might be okay since in that case y1 was equal to y2. \n\nYes, since in the second condition (y1 ==y2 ), so y2 + dif is same as (y1 + dif). \n\nNow the code looks correct. \n\nWait, what about when the difference is zero? For example, if x1 = x2 and y1 = y2. Then the first condition is entered, but the difference becomes zero, so x1+0 is x1, so that gives original points. But the problem probably requires some output here? The code would print the same points, but maybe the problem would require that? \n\nAlternatively, the input might not have such cases. But the code would handle it, which is fine.\n\nTesting for an example:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose x1, y1 = (2,4), x2,y2=(2,6). Then x1 ==x2. dif is 2.\n\nOutput: x1 +2=4, the first point (4,4), next (4,6). Which is a horizontal line of length 2, same as original vertical line of length 2.\n\nAnother example:\n\nx1=1,y1=3; x2=3,y2=3 (horizontal). So dif is 2 (abs(1-3)). Output: 1, 5 (3+2) and 3, 5. So two points (1,5) and (3,5). Which are a horizontal line's two ends, shifted up by 2?\n\nWait the code's output is x1 (1), y1 +2 (5), then x2 (3), y2 +2 (5). So that's the same line but shifted upwards, making a rectangle. \n\nSo it's correct as per the code's logic.\n\nSo Fortran code seems ok."
