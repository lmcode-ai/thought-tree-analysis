  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me take a look at what the Java code is doing first. \n\nThe main program reads four long integers, and then calculates the maximum of several products of pairs. The actual computation is straightforward: after getting the four numbers into an array, it computes the max of a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], and a[1]*a[2]. Then it prints the maximum of all those.\n\nLooking at the code, there's some boilerplate like the FastReader class, which is a common way to read input in Java quickly. But Fortran has its own input methods, so I need to handle that part differently. \n\nThe modPower function and the pair class aren't used here, except in the code given. Since the main function doesn't reference those, maybe I can ignore translating those parts? Wait, the problem might not even require them. Let me check the main method again.\n\nRight, the main just uses the FastReader to get four longs and then computes the max. So I can probably ignore the FastReader and modPower parts for this translation, unless they are actually needed here. Since the FastReader is just for input, I can replace that with Fortran's read statement.\n\nFirst step: Read four numbers in Fortran. \n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. The variables here are four integers, but they're using nextLong() in Java, which is 64-bit, so in Fortran, I should use integer(8) (assuming 8 is 64-bit, which is common in compilers like gfortran where integer(kind=8) is 64 bits). \n\nSo the array 'a' would be a 1D array of size 4, of type integer(8).\n\nThe main computation: compute the products a(1)*a(3), a(2)*a(4), a(1)*a(4), a(2)*a(3). Then take the maximum of all four. Wait, but in Java, it's a array from 0-based: so a[0] is first element, so in Fortran, which is 1-based by default, the indexes would be adjusted. So in Java:\n\na[0], a[1], a[2], a[3] correspond to a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4) in Fortran.\n\nWait, but wait, the Java code's array is declared as long[4], which has indices 0 to 3. So for the four elements, the Java expressions are:\n\na[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], a[1]*a[2]\n\nIn Fortran, the indices start at 1, so those would become a(1)*a(3), a(2)*a(4), a(1)*a(4), a(2)*a(3). \n\nTherefore the max is the same as the Java code's, but with indices shifted by 1.\n\nSo the formula in Fortran would be: \n\nmax_val = max( a(1)*a(3), a(2)*a(4), a(1)*a(4), a(2)*a(3) )\n\nThen print that value.\n\nThe FastReader in Java is just a way to read inputs quickly. In Fortran, reading from stdin is straightforward. The program can read the four numbers using a read *, a statement. \n\nSo the steps for the Fortran code:\n\n1. Declare an array a of 4 integers (8 bytes each).\n2. Read four numbers into the array.\n3. Compute the four products and their maximum.\n4. Print the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code might look like:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: a(4)\ninteger(8) :: max_val\n\nread *, a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4)\n\nmax_val = max( a(1)*a(3), a(2)*a(4), a(1)*a(4), a(2)*a(3) )\n\nprint *, max_val\n\nend program main\n\nWait, that's simple enough. Let me verify.\n\nWait, in Fortran arrays, the first element is index 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the array is a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], which in Fortran would be a(1) to a(4). So the products are correctly calculated here.\n\nSo is there any edge cases? Like, if the numbers can be negative? But the problem's calculation is just the max of all those products regardless of sign. Since Java and Fortran both calculate the product same way. \n\nTherefore, this translation should work.\n\nWait, also in Java, the Math.max function is used, but in Fortran, the built-in max function can take multiple arguments. However, I think in Fortran max(a,b,c,d) might be possible? Let me recall.\n\nIn fact, in older versions, you had to take max(a, max(b, max(c,d))), but maybe in Fortran 90 and up, you can just write max(a,b,c,d). Let me check: \n\nYes, according to Fortran 90 standard, the MAX function can take multiple arguments, so the code is okay. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nBut let me check the input reading again. \n\nAlternatively, another way is:\n\nread *, (a(i), i=1,4)\n\nBut the straightforward way as four separate variables is also okay.
