  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The program is solving some problem where you have an array of integers, and for each bit position from 0 to 59, calculate something related to the number of set bits and then combine them into an answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, let's see the Java code structure. The class has a main method that reads N, then an array of N longs. Then, for each bit from 0 to 59, it calculates the number of set bits (count1), then computes a value a which is count1 times (n - count1), shifts that a by the current bit position (times 2^bit), then adds it to the answer modulo the div. \n\nHmm. The Fortran version will need to handle input, loops, bitwise operations, and modulus.\n\nLet me note the key parts:\n\n1. Reading input: Using Scanner in Java. In Fortran, probably read from stdin using read(*,*) statements.\n2. The loops: Two nested loops, but the inner loops go up to 60 bits. \n3. Bit operations: Checking if the i-th bit is set. In Java it's A[j] >> i & 1. In Fortran, we can do bitwise shifts and masks.  \n4. The modulus operations, especially the part where a is shifted and modded. \n\nFirst step is to outline the Fortran program structure. Since Fortran doesn't have classes, the code would be in a program block, possibly with subroutines if needed, but here it can be done in the main.\n\nLet's think variable types. The original Java uses long, which in Fortran is INTEGER*8 perhaps, but in newer Fortran standards, use INTEGER(KIND=8). Since the problem can handle numbers up to 1e18 perhaps, 64-bit integers are needed. \n\nThe variables:\n\n- div: (10^9 +7). So need to compute that. 10^9 is 1000000000, so 1000000007.\n- A array: dimensioned as n elements, n is input.\n- ans starts at 0, accumulates.\n- For the loops: i from 0 to 59, but in Fortran loops start at 1 by default, so probably need to set from 1 to 60 but subtract 1 when using, or adjust the loop variables.\n\nWait, in Java for(int i =0; i <60; i++), so 60 iterations starting at 0. So in Fortran do i=0,59 ? Yes, since in Fortran, the loop can start from an increment step. Wait, no, the syntax is \"do i = start, end, step\", default step is 1. So yes, \"do i = 0,59\".\n\nWait, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. That is a big point. The array A in Java is 0-based (since for i from 0 to n-1). So in Fortran, the array will be 1-based. Need to be careful with indices. The n in Java is the input size, so in Fortran, we'll declare A(1 to n). When reading, in Fortran, to read n elements, but starting from 1. But in the loops over the array, the indices in the Fortran code should go from 1 to n, not from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, so that could be a problem. So in the loops in Java:\n\nfor (int j =0; j <n ;j++) ... so in Fortran, the loop over j must go from first to last element of array A. Let's say the array is size n, indexed from 1 to n, so in Fortran, the loop would be j=1 to n.\n\nBut in the code, the loops:\n\nMain loops:\n\nFor each bit i from 0 to 59:\n\nThen for each element in A (j from 1 to n in Fortran, 0 to n-1 in Java):\n\nCompute if the i-th bit is set. \n\nSo the Fortran code needs to:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read array elements into A(1..n).\n\nThen loop over each bit 0 to 59.\n\nNow the first tricky part is the bitwise shift and AND. \n\nHow to get the i-th bit of A(j). \n\nIn Java: (A[j] >>i) &1. \n\nIn Fortran, the bitwise shift right can be done via shift = rshift(A(j),i). Then AND with 1. Since in fortran, the shift may need to be done carefully, especially handling negative numbers. However, since the problem likely expects non-negative numbers, so probably okay. \n\nWait, in Java, the right shift could be logical (unsigned shifts?) but wait, Java's >> is signed shift, but when testing for bits, maybe the numbers are non-negative. \n\nAssuming all A elements are non-negative, so the shift is okay. \n\nIn Fortran, when shifting, for integers, the function is iand(ishft(A(j), -i), 1) perhaps?\n\nAlternatively: To shift right by i bits, and then take the last bit. The correct way in Fortran is to use the rshift function. \n\nWait, let me check the functions:\n\nishft(n, shift): shifts n left if shift is positive. So for shifting right by i bits, use ishft(A(j), -i). But ishft returns the same integer type. Then, the bitwise and with 1.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nThe function ishft is intrinsic.\n\nSo (ishft(A(j), -i) must be shifted right, then AND with 1. \n\nWait, then:\n\nbit = btest(A(j), i) ?\n\nHmm, alternatively Fortran has the BTEST function. Wait BTEST(i, pos) returns true if bit pos is set. \n\nWait, let me recall: BTEST(bit_data, bit_number). If bit_number is the position, starting from 0 at the least significant bit. \n\nAh, that's exactly what we need. So maybe BTEST(A(j), i) returns whether bit i is set. So for example, if bit 0 is the least significant (rightmost), which is what we want. \n\nYes, so in Java (A[j] >> i & 1 ), which is equivalent to testing if bit i is set. So BTEST(A(j),i) would give the same result. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, can replace the inner count1 by looping over j from 1 to n, and accumulate count1 where BTEST(A(j),i).\n\nSo that's better and simpler.\n\nSo count1 can be initialized to 0, then:\n\ndo j=1,n\n\n   if ( BTEST(A(j),i) ) then\n\n      count1 = count1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's easier.\n\nThen a is count1*(n -count1). Then, multiply by 2^i (since the bits are processed per bit position, and multiplied by 2^i each? Wait, in the a's calculation:\n\nWait in Java code: \n\na is initialized to 0, then set to a += count1*(n - count1). Then we multiply by 2^i ?\n\nWait: The part of shifting a left by i times 1 shifts? Because a is multiplied by 2^i.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nIn Java's code, for a bit position i, the a is count1*(n-count1). This is then shifted left by i bits (each shift left multiplies by 2; but in the loop over j from 0 to i-1, it does a <<=1; which is same as a *=2 each step. So total of i times. So overall, a * (2^i) * ... then mod the division.\n\nWait the line:\n\nAfter calculating a = count1*(n-count1):\n\nfor (int j=0; j <i; j++)\n\n    a = (a <<1) % div;\n\nThis is equivalent to a multiplied by 2^i mod div. Because each shift left is multiplicative.\n\nSo in code terms, The a after the shifts is (count1 * (n -count1 )) * (2^i) mod div? Wait, but the mod is applied each step, so the total is same as (count1*(n-count1) * (2^i)) mod div? Or same result modulo div.\n\nWait the code does it incrementally: For each j up to i-1 steps, it shifts left (times 2 each step) and takes mod each step. The total is 2^i times initial a mod div.\n\nSo in Fortran, the calculation can first compute temp = count1*(n -count1)\n\nthen multiply by 2^i mod div.\n\nAlternatively, compute the exponentiation of 2^i mod div first, but need to be careful with exponentiation modulo. \n\nAlternatively, to compute 2^i, since i ranges up to 59, which is manageable. 2^59 is about 5e17. Considering that div is ~1e9+7, the product temp * (2^i) can overflow, so we need to compute modulo properly.\n\nAlternatively, compute 2^i modulo div. \n\nWait 2^i mod div can be done via powering.\n\nWait, but 2^i could be up to 2^59, which even mod 1e9+7 requires some steps, but even so. \n\nLet me think: The code is (a << i) mod div. Because a is count1*(n -count1), then left shift by i bits (times 2^i), so the value is count1*(n - count1)* 2^i mod div.\n\nBut in code, the shifting is done step by step and mod while shifting. So the result is the same as ( count1*(n-count1) * 2^i ) mod div ?\n\nYes, because shifting by i bits is multiplying by 2^i. \n\nTherefore, perhaps in Fortran, compute pow2_i = 2^i mod div. Then compute (count1*(n-count1) * pow2_i) mod div, then add to ans mod div.\n\nThat's better because we can precompute the pow2_i.\n\nWait, but when i can be up to 59, the maximum pow2_i is 2^59 which is 576460752303423488. The div is 1e9+7 which is 1000000007.\n\nWait 2^30 is over a billion. So 2^i mod div has to be computed as, perhaps using exponentiation by squaring, or in a loop:\n\npow2_i can be stored.\n\nAlternatively, for each i from 0 to 59:\n\npow2_i = 1\n\nloop for j from 1 to i: pow2_i = (2*pow2_i) mod div.\n\nWait that's possible, since i can be up to 59, max steps 59, so manageable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\npow2_i = mod( 2_i8**i, div )\n\nWait but 2^59 is a big number. Using ** exponentiation may overflow in Fortran's integers. Since the maximum integer is typically 32 bits (if using default integers) but we can use 64-bit integers. \n\nWait but in any case, maybe better to compute pow2 as follows:\n\npow2 = 1\n\ndo jj =1, i\n\n   pow2 = mod(2*pow2, div)\n\nend do\n\nThat way even for i=59, it's 59 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nWait but for loop over i from 0 to 59, for each, you can compute pow2_i as 2^i mod div. Alternatively, precompute them in an array. But maybe in the inner loops it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the Java code:\n\nThey compute a = count1*(n - count1)\n\nthen shift left by (i) times (the loop from j=0 ; i times? Wait in code, for the loop j from 0 to i-1, i steps, each shifting left by one. So total of i shifts. Thus total shifts is i times.\n\nSo the a << i is equivalent to a * 2^i. So then modulo div.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\na_val = count1 * (n - count1)\n\npow2_i = 1\n\ndo jj=1,i\n\n    pow2_i = pow2_i * 2\n\nend do\n\na_val = (a_val * pow2_i) mod div\n\nThen add that to ans. Wait but perhaps we can compute pow2_i as mod each time to prevent overflow?\n\nYes, better way:\n\npow2_i = 1\n\ndo jj =1, i\n\n    pow2_i = mod( pow2_i * 2, div )\n\nend do\n\nThen the a_val is (count1 * (n - count1) * pow2_i ) mod div.\n\nWait but (count1*(n - count1)) can be very large, up to n ~ 1e5, so the product could be up to (1e5)^2 ~ 1e10. Multiplying by 2^59 is way too big. So we have to do this modulo to prevent overflow?\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex. Let's think differently. The original Java code does the shifting step by step and mods each time. That way, they don't have to compute 2^i directly. So perhaps in Fortran, replicate the shifting process.\n\nIn Fortran, a is a variable, initially count1*(n - count1). Then, loop jj from 1 to i:\n\na = mod( a * 2, div )\n\nSo that's the same way as the Java code. So:\n\na_temp = count1*(n - count1)\n\nthen, do jj = 1, i\n\n    a_temp = mod( a_temp * 2, div )\n\nend do\n\nthen, add a_temp to ans mod div.\n\nWait but in Java, the initial a is set to a += count1... wait Java's a is initialized to 0, then set to a + ... ?\n\nWait let me check again the java code:\n\nLooking at the Java code's loop over i:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <60; i++) {\n\n    long a =0; // initialized here to 0 each time.\n\n    count1 is computed as the count.\n\n    a = a + count1*(n -count1); // so a = count1*(n-count1).\n\n    then loop for j=0...i-1: shifts and mod.\n\n    so a is the value we want (count1*(n-cnt)*2^i mod div) \n\n    then ans += a; ans%div etc.\n\nWait in Java, since a is a local variable, per i iteration. So in Fortran, for each bit i, compute the value a_bit which is (count1*(n- count1 )) * 2^i mod div. \n\nSo the way to compute this in Fortran without overflow would be:\n\n    temp = count1 * (n - count1)\n\n    pow2 = 1\n\n    do jj=1, i \n\n       pow2 = pow2 *2 \n\n    end do\n\n    temp = (temp * pow2) MOD div \n\n    ans = (ans + temp) MOD div \n\nWait but here, when i is 59, 2^59 is very big. So even with 64-bit numbers, multiplying 2^59 (approx 6e17) and count1*(n-count1) (if count1 is 1e5, so 1e10) gives 6e27, which would overflow 64-bit integer.\n\nAh, that's a problem. So this approach would introduce overflow if we are using 64-bit integers (since 64-bit can hold up to 2^63 or ~9e18, if unsigned, but for signed it's less). \n\nSo 2^59 is 5.76e17, multiply by 1e10 gives 5.76e27 which is over 2^64 (~1.8e19). So it would overflow. Hence we need to compute the product modulo div at each step, just like in the Java code.\n\nTherefore, better to compute the shifts step-by-step, similar to the Java loops.\n\nSo in Fortran code, inside each i, after computing count1:\n\na = count1*(n - count1)\n\nthen loop jj=1 to i:\n\n   a = mod( 2*a, div )\n\nThen, this way, after each step, a is modded by div so that it doesn't overflow.\n\nWait but in initial step, a is count1*(n-count1). Let's see:\n\ncount1*(n-count1) can be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10 (assuming n is 1e5). The div is 1e9+7, so the initial a can be up to ~ ( (1e5)^2 ) mod (1e9+7). Wait but the modulus is applied during shifts, so even if the initial a is big, after the first shift step it would have been modded, but no. Because the loop over jj starts with a's value. \n\nWait in the approach where we compute a as count1 * (n - count1), then for each shift step multiply by 2 and mod.\n\nThe problem is the initial a can be up to 1e10, which when multiplied by 2^59 would be way too big, but since at each step after multiplying by 2, we mod by div, then the a variable stays small. \n\nLike for each step:\n\na starts as c = (count1*(n-c)), then:\n\nafter first iteration: 2*c mod div.\n\nThen next: 4*c mod div etc.\n\nThus, even for large i=59 steps, the maximum a is up to 2*(div-1), since mod is applied each step. So it can stay within 64-bit range because div is 1e9+7, so multiplying by 2 and mod is manageable.\n\nYes, that way, the operations can be done without overflow. \n\nTherefore, the approach for the i loop in fortran is:\n\nInside the i loop (over each bit):\n\ncompute count1 via BTEST.\n\ncompute the initial a (count1 * (n-count1) )\n\nthen for jj up to i times, do multiply by 2 mod div.\n\nWait yes, so in code:\n\ndo i =0,59 \n\ncount1 =0\n\n    ...loop over j and count1...\n\na = count1*(n - count1) \n\ndo jj =1, i\n\n   a = mod( a *2, div )\n\nend do \n\nans = mod(ans + a, div )\n\nend do\n\nWait exactly. That's the way to do it.\n\nNow variables:\n\nThe variables in Fortran:\n\ndiv is 1e9+7.\n\nA is an array of dimension n (but in Fortran needs to be declared in advance. Wait problem is, the input n is read first. So in Fortran, we need to declare the array with a sufficient size, or use dynamic allocation.\n\nFortran can allocate arrays dynamically. Since in newer Fortran versions (F90+), you can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo first steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen allocate the array of size n.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC147_D\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger*8 :: n, div, ans, i, j, count1, a, pow_i\n\ninteger*8, allocatable :: A(:)\n\ndiv = 1000000007\n\nread(*,*) n \n\nallocate( A(n) )\n\nread(*,*) A\n\nans = 0 \n\ndo i=0,59 \n\n   count1=0\n\n   do j =1, n \n\n      if ( btest( A(j), i ) ) then \n\n          count1 = count1 +1 \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   a = count1 * (n - count1)\n\n   do jj=1, i \n\n       a = mod( a * 2 , div ) \n\n   end do \n\n   ans = mod( ans + a, div ) \n\nend do \n\nwrite(*,*) ans \n\ndeallocate(A)\n\nend program\n\nWait but let me check details. Let me see variables:\n\nAll variables are declared as integer*8 since they need to handle up to 2^60 values: since the maximum a is count1*(n-count1)*2^59 mod 1e9+7, but the multiplication steps apply mod each time, so a is kept below 2*1e9+7 each step, so 64-bit integers can hold this.\n\nWait, but when counting 'count1' which can be up to n (which can be up to, say 1e5?), the product count1*(n-count1) can be up to around (1e5)^2 ~1e10. So this may be more than 2^32 (since 2^32 is around 4e9), but since we have 8-byte (64-bit) integers, that's fine.\n\nThe main steps should be okay.\n\nWait, when computing a = count1*(n-count1). For count1=1e5, then (count1*(n -count1)) = similar to ~1e10, and in mod terms, since the following loop is multiplying by 2^i, but then each multiplied with mod, it should be okay.\n\nNow, checking the loops:\n\nThe outer loop is for i =0 to 59.\n\nIn the inner loop over j from 1 to n: correct, since array is 1-based.\n\nThe jj loop is from 1 to i, so for i=0, we loop jj from 1 to 0? Wait in Fortran, the do loop's DO VAR = start, end. If start > end, the loop is not executed. So for i=0, the inner loop jj runs from 1 to i=0 \u2192 loop count0 is zero, so multiplicative factor is 2^0 \u2192 1, so a remains count1*(n-cnt).\n\nClose.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nWait let me see the initial value for a in the code above.\n\nWait yes.\n\nThe part:\n\na = count1*(n - count1) \u2192 that is correct.\n\nthen loop jj from 1 to i. Since jj starts at 1, which for each iteration is multiplying by 2 and mod div, done exactly i times. thus it's the same as multiplying by 2^i mod div.\n\nYes, so that loop does the same as Java's shifting.\n\nThen, the ans is updated modulo div each step.\n\nNow, in fortran, the read line for A is in the code above as:\n\nread(*,*) A\n\nWhich reads until EOF? No, not sure. Because the input is n numbers. In fortran, the read statement assuming free format can be read as *, (A(i), i=1,n) but with an allocatable array, perhaps better to use a loop to read all n numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the line:\n\nread(*,*) A \n\nshould read all the elements of the array A. Since it is an array, but in fortran, when the array is contiguous and of appropriate size (n), it should read n elements. So perhaps that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, to be safer, perhaps use:\n\nread(*,*) (A(j), j=1,n)\n\nYes, but that's a list-directed read of n elements into A. So yes, that is better.\n\nWait in the code above the problematic line is:\n\nallocate A(n), then read *, A \u2192 which would require the next input line to have n numbers, which would work. But it's better to ensure.\n\nAlternatively, in F90 syntax, it would be:\n\nread(*,*) (A(j), j=1,n)\n\nAfter the allocation.\n\nSo replacing the read for the array:\n\nallocate( A(n) )\n\nread(*,*) A \n\nbecomes:\n\nallocate( A(n) )\n\nread(*,*)(A(j), j=1,n)\n\nAlternatively, you can read with a loop:\n\ndo j=1,n\n\n   read(*,*) A(j)\n\nend do\n\nBut that would require each in its own line, but the problem's input likely has them space separated in one line.\n\nSo the original code (Java) uses nextLong() which reads all the numbers from stdin in sequence, so in fortran, using read(*,*) A reads the next n numbers into A in order, which is correct as long as the input is in a single line.\n\nAssuming that's the case, the line read(*,*) A is okay.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you read into an array, if the line is not sufficient, it will continue reading from the next line. So the input must be provided in a way that the numbers for the array are in the same line or in the next lines as needed.\n\nBut the code should work as per the problem's input, which probably all numbers after n are in one line. So this should be okay.\n\nNow, the modulus function. \n\nThe mod function in Fortran can return negative numbers if the first argument is negative, but here we are dealing with non-negative numbers. The original Java uses modulo with positive numbers so mod(a, div) in Fortran should be the same.\n\nNow other thing: when multiplying a by 2 and taking mod, but in arrithmetic mod of negative numbers?\n\nBut since a is computed as a = count1*(n -count1), which is non-negative. Then multiplied by 2^i, remains non-negative. Thus, mod( a * 2, div ) will give a non-negative value less than div.\n\nSo modulo is handled correctly.\n\nThus, the code written above should be correct.\n\nLet me check variable declarations:\n\nAll variables are declared as integer*8? Let's check the variables:\n\ndiv is 1e9 +7, which is about a billion, so 4 bytes would fit, but to be safe with the computations (as n could be up to, say, 1e5?), but the products could be up to 1e10 as before, so variables for a, count1, etc. need to be 8 bytes.\n\nYes, all vars declared as integer*8 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, Fortran can use 8-byte with SELECTED_INT_KIND types, like integer(kind=8).\n\nBut in fixed form code (if needed), but the code as presented is using free form. The issue is compatibility.\n\nThe code I wrote is using 'implicit none', and declares variables with integer*8, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nSo the final Fortran code is as above."
