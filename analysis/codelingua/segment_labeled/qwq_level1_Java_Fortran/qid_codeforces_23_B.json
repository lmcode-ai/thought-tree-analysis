  "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does. The main class has a main method that reads an integer t, which is the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n and prints the result of maxLeft(n). The maxLeft function returns n-2 if n is greater than 2, else 0.\n\nHmm, Fortran is different from Java in syntax and structure. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the program structure. In Fortran, programs start with a program block. Since Java uses a class and a main method, Fortran will just have a program name. So I'll start with something like program codeforces_23_B followed by end program.\n\n next, the main logic: reading input and looping t times. In Fortran, input can be read using read(*,*) statements. The Scanner in Java is replaced by direct reads here.\n\nThe loop in Java is a for loop from 0 to t-1. In Fortran, we can use a do loop. The variable i isn't used except for the loop count, so maybe we can just loop t times without tracking the index. Like do i = 1, t ... end do. Wait, Fortran's loop indices can start from 1. Wait, in Java it's from 0, but in Fortran, it's easier to start from 1. The actual value of i isn't used, so starting at 1 is okay.\n\nNext, the function maxLeft. The Java method returns n-2 if n>2 else 0. In Fortran, functions are declared with a function name and result. The function should probably be an integer function. So maybe:\n\ninteger function maxLeft(n)\ninteger, intent(in) :: n\nif (n > 2) then\n    maxLeft = n -2\nelse\n    maxLeft = 0\nendif\nend function\n\nBut I have to make sure the function is available in the main program. In Fortran, the function can be contained within the program or placed before it. Since Fortran sometimes requires functions to be declared before use, perhaps placing it inside the program or using a module? Alternatively, putting the function inside the program block works in modern Fortran.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_23_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, n, i\n\n    read(*,*) t\n    do i = 1, t\n        read(*,*) n\n        print*, maxLeft(n)\n    end do\ncontains\n    integer function maxLeft(n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        if (n > 2) then\n            maxLeft = n -2\n        else\n            maxLeft = 0\n        end if\n    end function maxLeft\nend program codeforces_23_B\n\nWait, the CONTAINS keyword is needed if functions are inside the program. That's correct. Alternatively, if the function is outside, but the contains is better here to keep it together.\n\nNow, check the code. The variables: t is read first, then for each iteration, n is read and the function called. The function is correctly returning n-2 when n>2 else 0.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the function name is also the variable that holds the return value.

The function maxLeft must have n as an input, declared with intent(in).\n\nIs there anything else? The loop index i in the Java is from 0 to t-1, but in Fortran the loop from 1 to t is okay since the index isn't used. The number of iterations is t, same as Java.\n\nI think that's it. So the translated code should look like the above. The contains is necessary if the function is inside the program. Alternatively, maybe the function can be placed before the program, but using containment is better for scoping.\n\nYes, this should work."
