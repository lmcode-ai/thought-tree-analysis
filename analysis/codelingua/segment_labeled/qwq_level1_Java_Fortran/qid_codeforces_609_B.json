  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads two integers n and m, then an array of n integers. It uses an array 'gen' of size 11 to count occurrences of each number in the input array. Then it calculates the sum of products of counts of pairs of different numbers (i and k where i !=k) and divides by 2 at the end. \n\nHmm, Fortran uses different syntax. So first, I should declare variables. The Scanner in Java is for input; in Fortran, I can use read(*,*) to get input. \n\nThe main variables are n and m. The array 'arr' in Java is size n, so in Fortran maybe an array of size n. But since n can be up to... Well, the problem constraints might determine that, but since Java uses an array, we can read n first, then allocate dynamically if possible. Wait, Fortran 90 and above can have allocatable arrays. \n\nWait, the gen array in Java is size 11, but in the code, they use indices from 1 to m, but m could be up to what? Well, since in the loops they loop to m, probably m can be up to 10. Wait, the problem statement isn't here, but in the original Java code the gen array is size 11, so indexes 0 to 10? Or maybe m can be up to 10. \n\nWait in the code, the gen array is initialized as new int[11], so indexes 0 to 10. But in the problem, perhaps the numbers are between 1 and m? Because in the loop that fills gen, arr[i] is used as the index, but in the Java code, arr[i] is read from input and used as the key for the gen array. So the possible values of arr[i] must be between 1 and m, otherwise the gen would have out-of-bounds indexes. So in the code, the input numbers must be between 1 and m. \n\nSo, in Fortran, the 'gen' array can be an integer array of size m+1, but maybe we can just use 11 as in the original code to avoid issues. \n\nNow translating the steps:\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n integers into the array arr. Then, for each element in arr, increment gen(arr[i]) by 1. \n\nThen compute the answer by looping i from 1 to m, and k from 1 to m, adding gen(i)*gen(k) if i\u2260k. Then divide by 2. \n\nWait the double loops: for each i and k, unless they are equal, add their product. So the total sum is sum_{i=1 to m} sum_{k=1 to m, k\u2260i} gen(i)*gen(k). \n\nAlternatively, the total sum is (sum(gen)^2 - sum(gen_i\u00b2)) divided by 2? Wait maybe there's a smarter way to compute it, but the code as written does the double loop. \n\nBut since the code uses the loops, I should translate that directly. \n\nNow in Fortran, the arrays are 1-based by default. So gen can be 1-based. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent of Java's 'gen' would be an array with indices from 1 to 10 perhaps? Or maybe we can make it 1 to m. Wait, but m can be up to, say, 10? The original code uses 11 elements to account for m possibly being up to 10 (since Java uses 0-based or 1-based? Wait in the Java code, the gen array is size 11, and they access [arr[i]], so if arr[i] can be 1-10, then that's 1-based indexing. Wait wait, maybe the input numbers can be 0? Wait the Java code initializes gen as [11], which in Java is 0-based indices from 0 to 10. But in the code, when the user inputs values into arr, when they process them as arr[i], these would be the values, which are then used as indices to gen. So if an element in arr is 0, that's acceptable, but perhaps the problem's constraints say that numbers are from 1 to m. Well, the code assumes that m is up to 10. Because the gen array is of size 11. But perhaps the problem specifies that the elements are between 1 and m, inclusive. \n\nAssuming that's the case, then in Fortran, the 'gen' array can be dimensioned as 0:10, but in the code, the indices would start at 1? Hmm. Wait, actually, Java's arrays start at 0, so if in the Java code the arr elements can have 0 as a value, but in the problem's context maybe the numbers are between 1 and m. The problem might be Codeforces problem 609B, which I can maybe recall as \"Greg and Array,\" which requires counting pairs of different elements. The gen array might just count the frequency of each possible number from 1 to m. Wait perhaps the input numbers are between 1 and m, so the code uses gen[1] up to gen[m], so the array size is m+1 in Java to avoid an index out of bounds, but actually, in the problem, m could be up to... The problem on Codeforces would have constraints, but assuming here that the code is correct, we need to translate it as is. \n\nIn Fortran, when declaring the array GEN, I can make it an array of size 11, with indices from 1 to 11 perhaps? Or since the Java array is 11, maybe Fortran's should be GEN(0:10) if it allows zero-based. But in FORTRAN 90+ arrays can be declared with any start and end. Wait, the original code uses indices from 0 to 10. Because in Java the array is new int[11], so the indices are 0 through 10. \n\nWait, but in the code, the loop for the arr input is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n    arr[i] = in.nextInt();\n    gen[arr[i]]++;\n}\n\nAh, so the value of arr[i] must be between 0 and 10 (since the gen array in Java is 11 elements, indices from 0 to 10). So perhaps the input numbers are in 1 to m, but m can be up to 10. Wait, no. The Java code treats each arr[i] as an index to gen. So the arr[i] (the elements in the array) can be any integer, but if the user inputs a value outside 0-10, then it would cause an error. So the problem must have a constraint that each element is between 1 and m, and m is <=10. So that the elements cannot exceed m's value, and m is up to 10. So in Fortran, we can set gen(1:m) but perhaps array size 11. Therefore, in Fortran, we can dimension gen(0:10). Let me proceed.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m. The input would be given via standard input. Then, read n numbers into the array arr. Then, initialize the gen array to zero, then for each element in the arr array, increment the corresponding count in gen. Then compute ans as the sum over i from 1 to m and k from 1 to m of gen(i)*gen(k) when i !=k. Then divide the result by 2.\n\nWait, why divide by 2? Because when i and k are swapped, they contribute the same term, so each pair is counted twice. So adding all i\u2260k pairs gives twice the desired value.\n\nWait let's see, the sum includes (i,k) and (k,i) both. So the total sum is equal to (sum(gen_i)^2 - sum(gen_i^2)), and that's equal to sum_{i\u2260k} gen_i*gen_k. Which is indeed the same as the double loops in the code. The answer is that sum divided by 2?\n\nWait no, the code computes the sum directly as (for each i and k, if i !=k, then add their product). So the total is sum_{i=1 to m} sum_{k=1 to m, k\u2260i} gen[i] * gen[k]. \n\nWhich can be written as sum_{i} gen[i] (sum_{k} gen[k] - gen[i}) ) \n\n= (sum gen)^2 - sum(gen_i^2).\n\nAlternatively, that's the same as the double loops adding all possible products except when i == k. \n\nSo the total sum is the same as (total^2 - sum(gen_i^2)), but the sum here is:\n\nfor each i, for each k !=i:\n\ngen(i)*gen(k) \n\nSo the total ans is exactly that. However, the code uses a double loop over all i and k up to m. So:\n\nfor i=1 to m,\n\nfor k=1 to m,\n\nif i !=k, then add gen[i]*gen[k]\n\nSo the total would indeed be that.\n\nThe code then prints ans divided by 2. Wait why divided by two? Because in this sum each pair (i,j) is counted once when i is first and j is second, and once when j is first and i is second. Wait no, in the loops, for all i \u2260 j, both (i,j) and (j,i) are included. But since the code does (i, k) for all i and k, the total includes each ordered pair twice except when i=j. Wait but the condition is i != k, so the total sum includes each unordered pair twice. Thus the code's answer is equal to twice the desired sum, so dividing by 2 to get the unordered pairs count. Wait, perhaps the problem requires the number of unordered pairs (each pair (a,b) is same as (b,a)), so each such unordered pair is counted once. The code's approach counts all ordered pairs where the two elements are different, so the total is exactly twice the desired count. So we need to divide by 2 to get the actual answer.\n\nThus, the program correctly calculates ans divided by 2.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran:\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nn and m are integer variables.\n\nThe array arr has length n. But in Fortran, we can have to read n first, then allocate an array of size n. Since in Fortran 90, one can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\ninteger, dimension(0:10) :: gen = 0\n\nBut in Fortran, the dimension for gen can be from 1 to m? Wait no, given that in Java it's 11 elements from 0 to 10, perhaps best to have 0 to 10 in Fortran as well.\n\nWait, maybe the code expects the elements of arr (the input array) can be 0 to m, but perhaps the problem's input constraints ensure that the elements are within 1 to m, but since the code uses gen[arr[i]], then as long as arr[i] is between 0 and 10 (since gen is of size 11, indices 0-10), m must be less than or equal to 10. Wait, in the code, m is read from the input, so the code may not guard against if m exceeds 10. But since the problem must have such constraints, we can proceed with an array of 0 to 10.\n\nTherefore, initializing gen as a 0:10 array, all zeros.\n\nThen, after reading the numbers, loop each number in arr, increment gen(arr(i)) by 1.\n\nThen compute the answer. The loops:\n\nans starts at 0. \n\nans = 0\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n    do k=1, m\n\n        if (i /= k) then\n\n            ans = ans + gen(i)*gen(k)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do \n\nBut wait, the original code's loops are from 1 to m (both i and k). So that's correct.\n\nWait but in the code, the loops start at i=1, but what if the elements in the array can be zero? Well, perhaps problem's constraints say that all elements are between 1 and m. Let me proceed.\n\nWait the original Java code has the loop for i (the index of arr) starting from 0, but the elements can be anything, but the problem's test cases will ensure that each arr[i] is between 1 and m, perhaps. \n\nSo the Fortran code is okay. Then the code divides ans by 2 and prints it.\n\nNow translating the code step by step:\n\nStart with the program:\n\nprogram codeforces_609_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, k\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\ninteger :: gen(0:10)  ! since it uses indices up to 10\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans  ! because the product can be big, but in FORTRAN we might need to use 8-byte integers. \n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\nallocate(arr(n)) \n\n! Read the array\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*,*) arr(i)\n\n   gen(arr(i)) = gen(arr(i)) + 1\n\nend do\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, m\n\n    do k =1, m\n\n        if (i /= k) then\n\n            ans = ans + gen(i)*gen(k)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans / 2\n\ndeallocate(arr)\n\nend program codeforces_609_B\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the types. The variables n and m are integers, arr is an array of integers. The gen array is zero-initialized?\n\nIn the code above, the initialization of gen to zero is missing. Since in Java the default int array starts at zero. So in Fortran, when declared as integers, they start with 0 only if initialized. Otherwise, they have garbage values. So the Fortran code should set all elements to zero before processing.\n\nSo we need to do:\n\ngen = 0 \n\nbefore starting to count.\n\nSo inserting that after declaring gen:\n\ninteger :: gen(0:10) = 0\n\nWait but in the declarations: \n\ninteger :: gen(0:10)\n\nthen inside the code:\n\ngen = 0\n\nbefore the loops. \n\nAlternatively, set the array to zeros in initialization. \n\nYes.\n\nLet me restructure that.\n\nThe full code:\n\nprogram codeforces_609_B  \n  implicit none  \n  integer :: n, m, i, k  \n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:)  \n  integer :: gen(0:10) ! Initialize to 0?  \n  integer(kind=8) :: ans = 0  \n\n  read(*,*) n, m  \n\n  allocate(arr(n))  \n  gen = 0  \n\n  do i = 1, n  \n    read(*,*) arr(i)  \n    gen(arr(i)) = gen(arr(i)) + 1  \n  end do  \n\n  ans = 0  \n  do i = 1, m  \n    do k = 1, m  \n      if (i /= k) then  \n        ans = ans + gen(i) * gen(k)  \n      end if  \n    end do  \n  end do  \n\n  print*, ans/2  \n  deallocate(arr)  \nend program codeforces_609_B  \n\nWait but in the first loop, the i starts at 1 because in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Wait variables i and k in the loops run from 1 to m. But m must be up to 10, as the gen array is size 11 (0-10), so if m exceeds 10, then gen might not have enough space. However, the original code would have that problem too, and the code is written assuming m is within 0-10. \n\nWait in the code's first loop for arr[i], the elements can be between 0 and m (if m is up to 10), but because m can be up to 10, the arr elements can only be from 1 to m. So the code should be okay. \n\nAlso, note that in the loops for i and k, they start from 1 to m. But in the case when m is 0, but probably the problem constraints say m is at least 1. \n\nAnother point: in Java, the initial setup for gen starts with all zeros. The Fortran code uses 'gen = 0' prior to reading the array, so that's correct. \n\nNow, the integer kinds. The 'ans' variable is declared as integer(kind=8) to hold very large numbers. Let's see, the maximum possible input for n can be up to, say 1e5 (depending on problem constraints). Suppose n=1e5, and each element is in 1..m. Then, for the worst case, if all elements except one are in one group, then gen[i] can be up to 1e5. Then the product between largest gen[i]*gen[j] would be 1e5 * 1e5=1e10. The loop summation would multiply that up to (m)^2 times, so for m=10, that's 100 terms, leading to 1e12. An 8-byte integer can hold up to about 1e18, so this is okay. \n\nAlternatively, using integer(8) or selected_int_kind, but in Fortran sometimes the 'integer*8' or 'integer(kind=8)' is used. But in some compilers, the kind might differ, but since the problem is to translate code, I'll proceed with 'integer(kind=8)'.\n\nWait in the code above, the 'ans' is set to 0 in its declaration, but then set again to 0 in the code. No problem.\n\nTesting: suppose n is 2, m is 2, and the array is [1,2]. \n\nThen gen(1)=1, gen(2)=1.\n\nThe loops would run:\n\ni=1: k=1 \u2192 skipped (i=k) so only k=2: add gen(1)*gen(2) \u2192 1.\n\nk=2: yes. \n\nThen i=2: loops k=1 and 2. So k=1: add 1, k=2 skipped.\n\nTotal ans becomes (1 +1) \u2192 2, then divided by 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 correct. The result is 1, the correct number of unordered pairs.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3, arr = [1,1,2]. Then gen(1)=2, gen(2)=1, gen3=0.\n\nThen the loops:\n\ni=1:\n\nk=1 \u2192 skipped. k=2: 2*1. k=3: 2*0 \u2192 total for i=1: (1+3 terms) \u2192 2*1 + 2*0 = 2.\n\ni=2:\n\nk=1 \u21921*2 \u2192 2, k=2 skipped, k3 \u21921*0 \u2192 add 2. Total for i=2: 2+0 = 2?\n\nWait Let's compute:\n\nFor i=1 and k ranges 1\u2192m (3):\n\nk=1 skipped. k=2: 2*1 = 2 \u2192 added. k=3:2*0 =0 \u2192 sum here 2.\n\ni=1 gives 2 + 0? Wait, k=1: skip.\n\ni=1, k runs 1: skipped.\n\ni=1, k=2 \u2192 2*1=2, k=3 \u2192 2*0 =0. So the total from i=1 is 2+0=2.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nk=1: 1*2 =2 \u2192 add to ans.\n\nk=2 skipped, k=3: 1*0 \u2192 0 \u2192 adds 2 and 0 \u2192 2.\n\nTotal from i=2 adds 2.\n\ni=3:\n\nAll k=1,2,3. Since i=3, which gen(3)=0, so all gen[3]*gen[k] would be 0.\n\nThus, all terms for i=3 \u2192 0.\n\nThus ans is (2) + (2) \u2192 total 4 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 2.\n\nWhat's correct?\n\nThe pairs are between different elements in the array [1,1,2].\n\nThe actual different pairs:\n\n(1,2) count is how many?\n\nThe elements are 1,1,2.\n\nAll unordered pairs:\n\nPairs (1,1), (1,2), (1,2) \u2192 The different pairs are the ones between (1 and 2) which occurs 2 times (the first and third element, second and third). \n\nSo total count is 2 \u2192 yes, the code would calculate ans = (2 + 2)/2 =2, which is correct.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo I think this code is correct."
