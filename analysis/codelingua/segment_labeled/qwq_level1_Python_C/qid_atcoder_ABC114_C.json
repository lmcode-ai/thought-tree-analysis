The current Python code checks if the set of the digits is exactly {'3', '5', '7'}, but actually, that's not correct. Because a number like '33' would have a set of just {'3'}, which is a subset of the allowed digits. So the condition in the Python code `set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'}` would be false. Wait, but in the Python code, the line 'ans = 1' only if the set of the entire string is exactly the 3 elements. So the current approach is incorrect, because only numbers that have all three digits: 3,5,7 would count. But the problem probably requires numbers composed only of those digits, allowing any of them, but the code's condition is wrong. Wait, perhaps this is a mistake in the original code? Wait, let me re-read the original Python code again to verify. The code is:\n\ndef aaa(n):\n    if int(n) > N:\n        return 0\n    ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n    for i in '753':\n        ans += aaa(n + i)\n    return ans\n\nWait a second, this code is actually only counting numbers that contain all three digits (7,5, and3) in their digits set? Because the condition is set(...) == {'7', '5', '3'}, but a number must have at least those three digits, but that's not possible for a single-digit number. Because for instance when n is '7', converting that gives set {'7'}, which is not equal to the set containing all three, so ans would be zero. Wait, then the base case for the initial '0' call, since '0' is passed, when converting to int(n) (0) which is <= N. So the set is {'0'}, so the ans starts as 0, but then the for loop would add i being '7', '5', '3'. Then the calls are to '07', '05', '03'.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code is doing. \n\nSo the problem is that the Python function aaa(n) is a recursive function that counts numbers composed only of 7,5,3 digits and do not exceed N. The base case is when the number exceeds N, it returns 0. Otherwise, it checks if the number uses only the digits 7,5,3. The counting is done by checking the set of characters in the number's string form. Then, it recursively calls the function by appending 7,5,3 to the current number, and accumulates the result.\n\nHmm. The initial call is aaa('0'), but in Python, the first check is if int(n) > N. So when n starts at '0', the first check fails, so we enter the code. The first part checks whether all characters of the numeric string are 7,5,3. Then for each of '7','5','3', it recursively calls aaa with n + i. \n\nWait, but since n is a string, like '0' + '7' becomes '07' which is 7? But in the first condition, they are converted to integer. So adding digits appends to the string, so the numbers can be formed as 7,75,753, etc. \n\nIn C, handling this is a bit different. Let me think of how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the variable N is read as an integer from input. So in C, that can be handled via standard input functions.\n\nNext, the function aaa takes n as a string? Well, in Python, the function parameter n is a string because when you append i to it (like '7'), you get a new string. Wait, in Python code, the parameter n is passed as a string. Because starting with '0', then appending '7' gives '07', but that is treated as a string. So the code treats n as a string, then converts it to an integer when checking against N. \n\nBut in C, we need to manage this. Maybe the function can take a string and process it, but passing strings around might not be as straightforward. Alternatively, we can pass it as a numeric value, but then appending digits (appended as 7,5,3 would require multiplying by 10 and adding the digit). However, the check to see whether all digits are 7,5 or3 would then need to be done each time. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to store the current number as an integer and track whether all the digits so far are only 7, 5, or 3. Because if the current number's digits are okay, then adding a new digit (7,5,3) will keep it valid. Wait, because the digits allowed are exactly those. So if we have built the number by appending only 7,5,3, then all of its digits will be in that set. Therefore, maybe we don't need the check at all except the initial point?\n\nWait, that's important. Let me think again. The current Python code checks if the set of the digits is exactly {'3', '5', '7'}, but actually, that's not correct. Because a number like '33' would have a set of just {'3'}, which is a subset of the allowed digits. So the condition in the Python code `set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'}` would be false. Wait, but in the Python code, the line 'ans = 1' only if the set of the entire string is exactly the 3 elements. So the current approach is incorrect, because only numbers that have all three digits: 3,5,7 would count. But the problem probably requires numbers composed only of those digits, allowing any of them, but the code's condition is wrong. Wait, perhaps this is a mistake in the original code?\n\nWait, let me re-read the original Python code again to verify. \n\nThe code is:\n\ndef aaa(n):\n    if int(n) > N:\n        return 0\n    ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n    for i in '753':\n        ans += aaa(n + i)\n    return ans\n\nWait a second, this code is actually only counting numbers that contain all three digits (7,5, and3) in their digits set? Because the condition is set(...) == {'7', '5', '3'}, but a number must have at least those three digits, but that's not possible for a single-digit number. Because for instance when n is '7', converting that gives set {'7'}, which is not equal to the set containing all three, so ans would be zero. Wait, then the base case for the initial '0' call, since '0' is passed, when converting to int(n) (0) which is <= N. So the set is {'0'}, so the ans starts as 0, but then the for loop would add i being '7', '5', '3'. Then the calls are to '07', '05', '03'.\n\nHmm, that suggests that there's a problem here, perhaps a mistake in the Python code's logic. Because according to this code, the starting '0' is not counted (correct because 0 is not made of those digits). But when processing '7', the set would be {'7'}, which is not equal to the required set {'7','5','3'}, so ans for '7' is 0. So that code's condition is wrong? \n\nWait, that must mean that the original code is incorrect. The problem says \"count all numbers composed only of 7,5,3 digits\", but the condition checks that all digits are in the set, and also that the digits include exactly those three? Or that the digits are a subset of the set {3,5,7}? Because the condition is if the set made of the digits is exactly the set {'7','5','3'}. \n\nWait that's a problem. Let me see. Take for example, the number 3. Its digits are {'3'}, the set is different from {'7','5','3'}, so it's not counted. Also 5 is not counted, 7 isn't counted either. Only numbers that have all three digits. So this code would not count numbers with 3,5,7 digits, but only numbers that have at least one of each? Wait that can't be right, unless the problem requires the number to contain all three digits.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code is incorrect. But the question is to translate it to C as written, not to correct it. So I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the original code is correct for the underlying problem's requirements. Maybe the problem was to count numbers that contain exactly the digits 3,5,7, but must include each of those digits at least once. If that's the actual problem, then the code works correctly. \n\nWell, regardless, the task is to port the Python code's functionality into C, so we need to translate as is.\n\nAssuming that's correct, let's think about how to transfer this into C.\n\nIn the Python function, the parameter n is a string, passed each time with an added digit on the end. The process in the function aaa is:\n\n1. Check if the integer version of n exceeds N: if yes, return 0.\n\n2. Then, check if the set of the digits of n is exactly {'3','5','7'}, so all digits are in those 3, and each of the three is present (wait, no. Because the set equality requires the entire set, so the digits must include 3, 5 and 7? No, for example '53' would have the set {'5','3'}, which is not equal to the target, so it won't count. So the code is counting numbers that must contain at least one of each digit. However that may be the question's intended problem.\n\nAnyway, regardless. To translate, the steps are:\n\nFirst, in C, we can pass the current number as a string, but handling variable-length strings is more cumbersome, perhaps using dynamic memory. Alternatively, pass the current numerical value as an integer, then use string checks for the digits as each step.\n\nHmm, but the digits must form a certain set. Maybe passing the number as an integer allows us to check each digit when converting it to a string, but perhaps it's easier to keep track of which characters are present in the digits. Alternatively, using a bitmask to track presence of 3,5,7.\n\nWait, let's think: For the current number 'n' (as integer), when we come into the function, we need to check that all its digits are in 3,5,7, and that at least one of each is present. \n\nWait, that might complicate the function parameters. So perhaps using an integer representation. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Recursion with the number as an integer and an accumulated set of digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the function can take two parameters: the current numeric value, and a bitmask (e.g., flags for presence of 3,5,7). \n\nWait, the bitmask could be three flags, but in C it could be stored as an integer (like has_3, has_5, has_7) but to track them all, perhaps a three-bit flag where each bit represents whether a digit is present.\n\nAlternatively, the current number's digits must be a subset of 3,5,7 (but the code requires that the digits exactly be the set of those three, but in this function the code adds all the digits. Wait the condition is that the current string corresponds to its digits being exact the three? So, the function's check is whether the set of the digits is exactly {3,5,7}. So that would require that the number's digits contain all three digits, but that would explain that the code counts numbers like '357', '375', '537', etc., but not 5, 3 etc. \n\nHmm, so that's a strange problem, but given that, how to code it in C?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's condition is incorrect. Maybe the original code intended to check that all digits are among {'3','5','7'}, not that all three are present. For instance, in Python:\n\nif all(c in {'3','5','7'} for c in str(n)) ?\n\nThen it would count any number made of those digits. But perhaps the code is correct for the problem it's supposed to solve.\n\nWell, the task is to translate it as written. So even if it's a wrong condition, I have to implement exactly what the code does.\n\nSo to handle the condition: that the set of characters in the digits is exactly the three given characters. \n\nSo the code does:\n\nset(s) == {'7','5','3'}, where s is the string of the number n (as integer). So the comparison is to check whether all the characters in s are exactly '7','5','3'.\n\nWait no, actually the right-hand side is a set of three elements, so the left-hand side's set must contain exactly those. For example:\n\nTake the string '5' \u2192 set {'5'}, so the condition is false. \n\nString '35' \u2192 set {'3','5'}, not the three elements \u2192 condition false.\n\nOnly numbers which have exactly those three digits in their digits would satisfy the condition. For instance, '357' \u2192 set is {'3','5','7'}, so condition is true.\n\nSimilarly '375' \u2192 set is the three.\n\nTime '7533' has a set same but includes more occurrences. So yes, still set is correct. \n\nTherefore, the code counts all numbers (comprised of digits 3,5,7) that include each of 3,5,7 at least once, and are \u2264 N.\n\nSo the code's logic is to count numbers made of 3,5,7 digits that have all three digits present, and don't exceed N. \n\nTherefore, the code uses a decision function which is to check if the current number (if it's \u2264 N) has all three digits.\n\nWait, that's an important part because in recursive calls, the numbers are built by appending 7,5, or 3. So starting from '0', adding digits to make longer numbers. Thus the child calls can have digits with all three included. \n\nHmm, so the count is for numbers made by appending digits 7/5/3, starting from 0, as strings, and whenever those numbers have all three digits present in their digits, then they contribute 1 to the count, provided they don't exceed N. \n\nThe approach in C would be to do this recursively but passing the current numeric string as a string. \n\nThe problem in C is handling the recursion with strings. Since strings in C are null-terminated arrays and cannot be easily passed and concatenated like in Python. \n\nAlternatively, we can represent the current string as a char array, but that might need dynamic memory handling. However, perhaps the recursion depth isn't too big here. \n\nWhat is the maximum N?\n\nAssuming N can be as big as a 12-digit number (like up to 2^40?), so the maximum possible length would be log_10(N). But even that could be handled in C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is to pass the current string as a character array, but use pointers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current numeric value plus some flag for whether it's included 3,5,7 so far. Let's think differently.\n\nApproach:\n\nLet's instead track for each step, the current number's value (as an integer), and flags indicating which digits (3,5,7) have been introduced so far.\n\nWait, but since the number is built by appending digits, the order in which they are added affects what digits are present. \n\nEach step in the recursion appends one of the three digits (7,5,3), so the current number is equal to previous * 10 + digit.\n\nThe flags can be a bitmask:\n\nfor example, bits 0 (for 3), 1 (for5), or 2 (for7). When any of those digits is added, the bitmask is updated. \n\nThus the function parameters can be current number, current bitmask, and then it can check if the number is \u2264 N, and whether the bitmask has all three bits set (since we need all three to be present).\n\nSo the base case is when the number exceeds N \u2192 return 0.\n\nOtherwise, if masks has all bits set \u2192 contribute 1 to the ans.\n\nWait, but even if the masks has all 3 bits set, but the current number is within N, so it counts.\n\nPlus, then recursively adding each of the next three digits, and propagating the masks. \n\nWait, that seems smarter and more efficient.\n\nSo, parameters to the recursive function can be:\n\n- A current number (int)\n\n- A bitmask (int, say, 3 bits)\n\n- N (int, passed as a global variable? Or as another parameter to the function?)\n\nWait, but in C, you can't pass this as a global variable unless it's set through a function; probably better to pass via the function parameters.\n\nWait, the Python version uses a global N. So in C, perhaps N would be a global variable. But in the Python code, the function aaa is inside the code where N is set. \n\nAlternatively, in C, making N a global variable would be okay, but passing it to the recursive function as a parameter is better for modularity.\n\nSo here's the possible approach:\n\nRewrite the logic using bitmask. \n\nThe function:\n\nint aaa(int current_num, int current_mask)\n\nThe base case:\n\nif current_num > N \u2192 return 0\n\nelse:\n\nif current_mask has all bits set (mask is 0b111 \u2192 which is 7?), then count = 1; else 0.\n\nThen, for each next digit d (7,5,3):\n\n- new_num = current_num *10 +d \n\n- new_mask = current_mask | (bit for d). So:\n\nfor d in 7,5,3:\n\ndigit_mask = 0;\n\nif d ==3 \u2192 set bit 0 (1 << 0)\n\nelif d ==5: set bit1 (1 <<1)\n\nelif d ==7: set bit2 (1 <<2)\n\nthen, new_mask = current_mask | digit_mask\n\ncall aaa(new_num, new_mask) and add the result to the total.\n\nSo the total is count + sum from each recursive call.\n\nWait, but for example, if current_num is 7 \u2192 mask would have only bit for 7 set (bit2). Then when appending 5, the new_mask would be 0b110 (bits 1 and2 set). \n\nEventually, when all three bits are set in the mask, then the count is 1 for that number.\n\nThus, this would count all numbers (built only by appending 3,5,7 digits) which have all three digits present, and don't exceed N. Which is exactly what the Python code was doing. \n\nThis is a much better approach, because it avoids string conversion and allows direct computation with integers, also the bitmask approach is faster. So this is probably a better way to write the code in C than translating the Python literally, but only if the code is logically the same as in Python.\n\nIs this approach an equivalence?\n\nYes. The Python code's condition is equivalent to whether all digits in the number's string are in the set and the set is exactly {'3','5','7'}. The bitmask approach achieves this.\n\nBecause the bits correspond to each digit's presence. So:\n\nThe mask needs to have bits for 3 (1), 5 (2), and7 (4) (or whatever, depends on the way they are represented). Let me think:\n\nLet me define:\n\nDefine mask bits:\n\n- bit0 (1): whether 3 is present in the digits so far.\n\n- bit1 (2): whether 5 is present.\n\n- bit2 (4): whether 7 is present.\n\nSo mask is a bitmask of 3 bits. So when all three bits are set (mask is 7), then all three digits have been used.\n\nNow, to form the mask when a digit is added, for example, adding a 3:\n\nthe digit mask is 1 (bit0).\n\nthe new_mask is current_mask OR 1.\n\nSo the mask accumulates the digits encountered.\n\nThus, the condition for counting the number (ans) is whether after calculating new_num (or in the current number), the mask has all three bits set, but in our approach, the function considers the mask from the path taken when building the number. \n\nWait, perhaps better to have:\n\nThe mask indicates the set of digits found thus far. So:\n\nfor each step, when you append a digit, you add its presence to the mask. Thus, if after the current number and its current mask, the mask has all the bits set, then the number counts as valid. So the count is 1 if mask includes all three bits, else 0. \n\nTherefore this approach is equivalent. \n\nThis is better than using strings because it avoids converting integers to strings and checking their characters each time. It also handles larger numbers more efficiently.\n\nSo coding this in C should be straightforward. \n\nNow, steps for code:\n\nFirst, the code reads N from input. \n\nThen, the function, let's call it count, with parameters current_num, current_mask, N. Wait, but in Python's code, N is global. So perhaps in C, define N as a global variable. Alternatively, make N a parameter to the function. It's more elegant to pass it in, but if it's a top-level function, perhaps better to have it as a global.\n\nLet me sketch the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint N;\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = ( mask & 0b111 ) == 0b111 ? 1 :0;  // if mask has all bits set \u2192 7?\n\n    int new_current;\n    int new_mask;\n    // for digits 7,5,3:\n    for (int d : {7,5,3})  // C doesn't have loops like this, so need a loop with array or separate code for each digit\n    // alternative:\n\n    for each digit d in {7,5,3}:\n        new_current = current *10 +d;\n        new_mask = mask;\n        if (d ==3) {\n            new_mask |= 1;  // Set bit0\n        } \n        else if (d ==5) {\n            new_mask |= 2; // bit1\n        }\n        else if (d ==7){\n            new_mask |=4; // bit2\n        }\n        count += aaa(new_current, new_mask);\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but wait the code in C will need to iterate over the digits. One approach is to create an array of the digits and loop over them.\n\nAlso, variables in each iteration (for 7,5,3 steps) must be in scope, etc. Also, initializing the loop:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nint digits[3] = {7,5,3};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++){\n\n    int d = digits[i];\n\n    etc }\n\nThus, here's a rough code outline:\n\nFirst, the initial call starts with current_num=0 and mask =0?\n\nWait the Python code starts with '0', which when converted to integer is 0, so initial call is with the string '0', which is 0. Then, the check: is 0 > N? If N is zero or negative, but the problem assumes N is a positive integer. Because input is N = int(input()), but perhaps the input is a positive integer.\n\nAssume N is at least 3 digits? Probably N can be as low as 0 or3. But when starting with '0', the code in Python adds '0'+'7' \u2192 '07' \u2192 parsed as 7, so the first valid numbers would be the three single digits, but they won't get counted because their masks won't have all three bits set. But for example, when current_num is 357, which is three digits, the mask will have all bits set \u2192 count 1.\n\nThus, in C:\n\nThe initial call should be aaa(0, 0), but then, the base case:\n\ncurrent_num is 0 \u2192 then we check mask is 0 \u2192 the count is 0, so the first contributes nothing. Then, adding each digit '7' or 5 or3:\n\nfor example, first call:\n\ncurrent=0, mask=0.\n\nThen, when processing digit d=7,\n\nnew_current is 7, new_mask is 4 (mask was 0 |4) \u2192 because d is 7 \u21924.\n\nmask becomes 4 \u2192 so when we call aaa(7, 4). \n\nInside that call, the current_num is 7. Since 7 is not > N (assuming N is at least 7?), then check mask (4) \u2192 is mask 7? No \u2192 count is 0.\n\nThen, for each of the digits (7/5/3):\n\ntaking d=5: new_num 75 \u2192 mask will be 4 (from before) plus 5's bit (2) \u2192 4|2 =6. So mask now is 6. \n\nThis continues, and when the mask reaches 7, then the current number is counted.\n\nSo the initial call to '0' will trigger the starting of the recursion. \n\nThe function would be called as aaa(0, 0), but with the base case handling.\n\nThus the code structure in C would need the global variable N.\n\nThe code outline would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint N;\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask) {\n    if (current > N)\n        return 0;\n    int has_all = (mask & 0x7) == 0x7;  // 0x7 is 0b111\n    int count = has_all ? 1 : 0;\n\n    // Now try adding 7,5,3 to current (current *10 + each)\n    int digits[3] = {7,5,3};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        int digit = digits[i];\n        int new_curr = current *10 + digit;\n        int new_mask = mask; \n        if (digit == 3) {\n            new_mask |= 1; // 0th bit for 3\n        } else if (digit ==5) {\n            new_mask |= 2; //1st bit for5\n        } else if (digit ==7) {\n            new_mask |= 4; //2nd bit for7\n        }\n        count += aaa(new_curr, new_mask);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", aaa(0,0));\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the initial call is aaa('0'), which is passed as a string. But in our code, we start with current 0, mask 0, which seems matching. \n\nWait one exception: when the number starts with 0. Like, for example, current 0 and appending 7 \u2192 becomes 7, which is okay. But in the Python code, the initial '0' is passed, and then when adding 7, it becomes '07', which when parsed as an integer is 7, so the leading zero is dropped. The same as in the C code, 0*10 +7 is 7, so leading zeros don't affect the number's value, so the mask handling is okay, since it includes the digit, even if it was leading after previous 0. \n\nWait but the mask for 0: mask is 0 initially. When first adding '3', which is the digit 3:\n\nnew_mask would set bit0, so mask becomes 1. The first call is for 3 \u2192 mask is 1. \n\nSo yes, the numbers are correctly built. \n\nThis code should work correctly. \n\nBut let's test possible test cases. \n\nTest case 1: N is 3.\n\nThen the smallest possible numbers made with 3,5,7 as digits and containing all three must have at least length 3.\n\nSo numbers like 357, 375, etc., but those would be 3 digits long, with the smallest being 357 (357 \u2265 357 \u2192 if N is 357 \u2192 count them). For N=3, the count should be 0. Because 3 is a single digit, so the mask is only 3 \u2192 mask has only 0th bit set, so not all bits. \n\nThus, when N is 357 (exactly 357), the count would be 1 (the number itself). \n\nSo when N is 3: initial call starts at current=0 and mask=0.\n\nThen, the first loop over digits adds 7,5,3 digits:\n\nfor digit in 7,5,3.\n\nLet's track the first path of digit 7 (for current 0):\n\nWe get new_curr 0*10+7 =7 \u2192 mask becomes 4 (binary 100, the bit for 7). So now going into aaa(7,4).\n\nInside that function call:\n\nCheck if 7> N (3: yes? 7>3 \u2192 so returns 0 \u2192 that path contributes nothing.\n\nSame for the 5 and 3.\n\nThe next digit would be 5:\n\nAdding 5 first gives current 5 and new mask 2 (bit for 5). So then going further, the recursion may proceed deeper, but eventually the numbers exceed N.\n\nOnly when building a three-digit number will there be a count. For N=357:\n\nLet's see when 357 is exactly N. The first path could be:\n\nStart with 3 \u2192 mask becomes1 (001).\n\nThen append 5 \u2192 new number 35 \u2192 mask is 001 | 010 =011 (1+2). \n\nThen append 7 to get 357 \u2192 new_mask is 1 |2 |4 = 7 (0111). So mask becomes 7.\n\nNow, the call to aaa(357, 7) would return: \n\ncurrent_num=357 which is equal to N \u2192 okay. Since mask=7, count starts at 1.\n\nThen the next digits 7,5,3 are added to form 3577 (exceeds), etc \u2192 all return 0. So the final count for 357 is 1+0+0+0 \u2192 1.\n\nThus, the code works correctly.\n\nNow, let's see if in the starting call of aaa(0,0), the first count is (since mask is 0 \u2192 no). So the count starts at 0, then adding each digit path. \n\nAnother test case: N= 357 \u2192 expected answer is 1.\n\nAnother test case: N=753 (the 7 at first). The count should be up to all possible combinations with three digits. \n\nLet the test case where N is 7577 \u2192 perhaps 3-digit 357, 375, 537, 573, 735, 753 (all three-digit numbers), and four-digit numbers like 3573, etc. \n\nBut the code would count all numbers up to N which have all three digits.\n\nThus, the C code using bitmask approach should be correct.\n\nNow, to confirm the code:\n\nWait in the mask when processing the digits, when adding digit d, the code uses the new_mask as mask | bit. For example, digit is3 \u2192 mask was previous value, so new_mask = prev | 1.\n\nBut what if the digit is added again? Like, appending a 3 to a number that already has a 3?\n\nThe mask still gets OR with the same bit again \u2192 it remains the same. That's okay because the presence is only kept (no problem).\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the above C code should be correct. \n\nWait, but looking back the code, the initial mask starts at 0 when current_num is 0. But the mask is 0 (all bits 0), but the digit 0 is not part of the valid digits (since their only allowed digits are 3,5,7. So the mask for 0's 0 digit is not included, which is correct because the first call is starting with 0, but the initial zero is not part of the valid digits. Because when the function passes current 0, mask 0. \n\nHowever, the first recursive calls will start with the digits 7,5,3 which will set their bits. Thus, the mask will be correct. \n\nThe leading zero in the initial call is not counted because it's not part of the valid digits. So the first digits processed are the first actual digits, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, this code should be the correct translation of the Python code's logic into C."
