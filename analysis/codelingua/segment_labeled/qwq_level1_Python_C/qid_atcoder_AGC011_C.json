But then the code would have to manage all nodes' linked lists. Alternatively, perhaps the array of dynamic arrays approach. Back to the original code's approach. The Python code's adjacency list is a list of edges for each node, stored in a list. In C, to represent adjacency lists as arrays, for each node: struct adj_list {\n    int *arr;  // array of adjacent nodes\n    int size;  // current size\n    int cap;   // capacity (current allocated space)\n};\n\nThen the array g is of length n+1: struct adj_list *g = malloc( (n+1)* sizeof(struct adj_list) );\n\nfor (i in 1 to n) {\n\n    g[i].arr = NULL;\n\n    g[i].size=0;\n\n    g[i].cap =0;\n\n}\n\nThen, for adding a edge v to u's list. void add_edge(struct adj_list *g, int u, int v){\n\n    if (g[u].size >= g[u].cap ){\n\n    // need to realloc\n\n    if (g[u].cap ==0){\n\n        // allocate initial size\n\n        g[u].cap = 1;\n\n        g[u].arr = malloc( g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n\n    } else {\n\n        g[u].cap *=2;\n\n        g[u].arr = realloc(g[u].arr, g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    g[u].arr[ g[u].size++ ] = v;\n\n} So adding an edge u-v would be:\n\nadd_edge(g, u, v); add_edge(g, v, u);\n\nBut in the edges reading loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<m; i++){\n\n    int u, v;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &u, &v);\n\n    add_edge(g, u, v);\n\n    add_edge(g, v, u);\n\n}\n\nThis way, the adjacency lists are properly maintained. Okay, now, the DFS function:\n\nThe DFS function needs to:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of (node, color) pairs. Initialize the stack. The stack can be represented as an array of structs { int u; int col; }, with a dynamic size. Wait, perhaps again with a VLA or using dynamic arrays. Since stack can be of up to n elements. Alternatively, inside the DFS function, we can use an array for stack. First, the function signature:\n\nint dfs( struct adj_list*g, int x, int *vis );\n\nWait but need to return a flag. All variables are pointers. Wait the Vis array is declared in main, so it's global-ish. Let's see. Alternatively, the DFS function needs to have access to 'vis' which is passed as a pointer.

If the dfs returns True, it's a bipartitioned component (cb increases?), else if it's not bipartitionable (so a non-bipartition component like an odd-length cycle, so cc increases?).\n\nAt the end, there's a formula to print: something about counting pairs? The formula is ci squared plus 2*ci*(n - ci), plus more terms. It looks like combinations. The final output might be counting the number of pairs where certain conditions apply. Not sure exactly, but the key is to translate the code accurately.\n\nNow, translating this into C. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\n- n and m: integers. Read via scanf.\n\n- vis array: in Python it's a list of n+1 elements (indices 0 to n). So in C, we can allocate an array int vis[n+1], but since n can be up to ... Well, maybe we need to read it first, so making it a pointer array.\n\nWait, but in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99 but not all compilers. Hmm, but since the problem might expect stack-based variables, perhaps the constraints aren't too big. Alternatively, use malloc.\n\nWait, but the original Python code uses [0] * (n+1) which is a list of size n+1 initialized with zeros. So perhaps in C:\n\nint vis[n+1]; but since n can be up to... Well, the problem might not specify, but let's proceed.\n\nOriginal code also has a graph g, which is a list of lists. So in C, the graph can be represented as an array of adjacency lists. However, dynamic arrays can be tricky in C. Let's see. Each node u has a list of connected nodes. Since it's an adjacency list, perhaps we can represent it with an array of pointers, and each element is a linked list or some dynamic array.\n\nAlternatively, to keep it simple, since the edges are undirected, each edge between u and v adds v to g[u] and u to g[v].\n\nBut in Python, they do g[u] += [v], so they are appending v to g's list for u. So in C, for each u, we need an array to hold the neighbors. But preallocating isn't possible for each, since the size isn't known beforehand. Therefore, perhaps we can use some dynamic structures.\n\nHmm, maybe using a struct to handle dynamic arrays? Like each node has an array and a current length. Alternatively, since in the problem, the number of edges is m, so total entries would be 2m (since each edge added twice). Let's try the following approach:\n\nFirst, allocate an array for each node's adjacency list. But since in C it's difficult to do linked lists dynamically, perhaps we can pre-allocate each node's array to a maximum size. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, let's read the edges first, count the number per node, then allocate the arrays accordingly. But that complicates the code.\n\nAlternatively, in C, for each node, we can have a dynamically growing array. Let's see. For example, for each node's adjacency list, keep an array (which can grow) and a size variable. Since handling dynamic arrays in C is a bit involved, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, use an adjacency list with maximum possible size. Since each edge contributes two entries (u to v and v to u), perhaps we can first count how many edges each node has, allocate the necessary space, then fill it in. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, follow the Python approach but use arrays that start at size 0 and add as needed. In C, to do this, perhaps:\n\nstruct Node {\n    int *adj;\n    int capacity;\n    int size;\n} g[ n+1 ]; \n\nBut that might be better. Alternatively, start with some initial capacity and realloc.\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Let me think again. Since C doesn't have built-in dynamic arrays, perhaps the easiest way is to pre-allocate arrays with some maximum possible size (assuming constraints aren't too tight). However, given the problem's input size is not specified (since the code is given), but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps in Python code, the graph is stored simply as a list of edges. The code in the Python uses a list of lists. The code builds the graph like for each edge:\n\nu, v = ... , so adds v to g[u] and u to g[v]. So for each entry in the edges, we need to add both ways.\n\nSo, in C, perhaps for each node we can have an array that grows as needed. But dynamic memory allocation would be required.\n\nAlternatively, in C:\n\nInitialize an array of pointers for each index, and their size. For example, first read all the edges, then:\n\nInitialize a list for each node's adjacency list. So, perhaps first count the number of edges for each node, so that when we read edges into the array, we can preallocate sizes.\n\nFirst, in code steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- First, iterate over all m edges to count how many edges each node has. Because to create arrays for adj lists.\n\nWait, but maybe in code, it's easier to first build an array that is an adjacency list with maximal pointers, and then process each edge.\n\nAlternatively, since this might be a bit involved, perhaps in the translation, we can adapt the approach to use adjacency lists with dynamic arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in C, using a struct for each adjacency list entry. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively perhaps use a linked list. Each node points to a linked list of neighbors.\n\nBut for the loop when doing the DFS, the linked list can be iterated.\n\nThe key is to find a way to implement the graph's adjacency lists in C.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to simplify, use a structure where each node has an array that grows as you add edge entries. For that, perhaps a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the code, the first loop over m edges is to build the graph, so perhaps proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, create an array of edges for each node. So, for each u and v:\n\n- Add v to the g[u]'s list.\n\n- Add u to the g[v]'s list.\n\nSo in C:\n\nWe can represent the graph as an array of linked lists, or as an array of pointers to arrays. Let me think:\n\nAlternatively, since C allows using arrays, maybe pre-allocate for the maximum possible entries. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the maximum number of edges is m, which can be up to, say, 1e5? Not sure. But the problem might not have big constraints.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nStep 1: Read n and m.\n\nStep 2: For each edge, u and v:\n\n   add v to g[u], and u to g[v].\n\nBut to do that in C:\n\nLet\u2019s see, perhaps using linked lists for each adjacency list.\n\nstruct AdjNode {\n    int vertex;\n    struct AdjNode* next;\n};\n\nstruct Graph {\n    int numVertices;\n    struct AdjNode** adjLists;\n};\n\nBut implementing this would require creating a linked list for each node.\n\nHmm, maybe manageable.\n\nBut perhaps even better, perhaps:\n\nAllocate an array of pointers to edges, with each node's edges stored in dynamically allocated arrays. So for each node u:\n\ng[u] is an array of integers (the adjacent nodes). For each edge between u and v, append to g[u] and g[v].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can create a struct for each adjacency list:\n\nstruct AdjList {\n    int *edges;\n    int capacity;\n    int size;\n};\n\nThen, create an array of these for all n+1 nodes (indexes 1..n).\n\nInitialize each with capacity like 16, start with edges as malloc(capacity), and size is 0. When adding an edge, if size >= capacity, realloc a bigger array (double the size). But in C, dynamic memory is required here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints are loose enough so that we can skip dynamic realloc and just precompute the needed size. But that would require making a first pass over all edges to count degrees. Let me see.\n\nAlternative approach: first process all edges to count the number of edges each node has, then allocate the necessary size.\n\nIn code:\n\nFirst, initialize two arrays to count the edges per node:\n\nint countE_adj[n+1], // counts for each node\n     countE_rev[n+1]; // need not, but maybe not necessary.\n\nWait, maybe just countE_adj[u] = number of edges from u.\n\nThen, first loop for each edge:\n\nfor each of the m edges, when reading u and v, you increment countE_adj[u] and countE_adj[v].\n\nOnce all edges are processed, you can allocate for each node u, the adjacency list array with size countE_adj[u]. Then, the second pass, read again the edges, but this time adding the edges in their respective array.\n\nBut this requires storing the edges first before processing again. Which could be done by reading into a struct array first.\n\nWait, perhaps easier to read the edges, but in the first read, just count the edges, then create the arrays with the needed sizes, then read again the edges (but that's not possible since input is done.)\n\nWait, in programming competition terms, the input is read once. So if you read the edges in first pass, you can't read them again. Therefore, perhaps the approach with dynamic growing arrays is better, with realloc.\n\nAlternatively, use static arrays, but pre-initialize to a high enough size. Maybe that's possible.\n\nWait in the Python code, since the graph can be built in code, when adding to g[u] is done by +=, which in Python lists automatically expands the array. In C, you can't have automatic arrays of size n, because n is read first, but with C99 variable length arrays, you might be able to do this.\n\nWait, but variable length arrays can be used in C99.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try:\n\nstruct adj_entry {\n    int *edges;\n    int len;\n};\n\nadj_entry g[ n + 1 ]; // but n is a variable.\n\nWait, but in C99, you can have variable length arrays. So perhaps the solution is:\n\nRead n and m first. Then, declare g as an array of adj_entry with sizes [n+1], each with an edges array.\n\nBut for each adj_entry's edges, we can start with some initial capacity, and then, when adding elements, we can check and expand as needed using realloc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Initialize the adjacency list array for each node from 1 to n.\n\n3. Read m edges, adding entries to each's adjacency list.\n\n4. Then, run the main logic (processing each node for dfs).\n\nNow, coding this, for each adjacency list:\n\nInitialize each adj_entry's edges to NULL, len to 0, and capacity to some initial value like 0 or 5. When adding a new edge:\n\nFunction to add an edge between u and v:\n\nAdd v to u's adjacency list. To do this:\n\nFor each of the two steps (u to v, and v to u):\n\nCheck the current len and capacity for each node. For example, for the first, u:\n\nif (g[u].edges is NULL or current len >= capacity):\n\n   if capacity is 0, set to 1.\n\n   else, multiply capacity by 2.\n\n   then realloc to new capacity.\n\nThen, append the value to edges[len], increment len.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfor each of the edges (u, v):\n\n   add_adj(u, v);\n\n   add_adj(v, u);\n\nWhere add_adj is a function that appends the value to the node's adjacency list.\n\nThis requires writing that function.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify code:\n\nInitialize each adj_entry with edges as pointers and dynamic memory.\n\nBut given the problem is to translate the Python code, this seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a C implementation using the following structure for each adjacency list, with dynamic arrays.\n\nNow, on to the other parts.\n\nThe main function after the graph is built is the loop through each node:\n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\n   if not visited (vis[i] == 0):\n\n       if len(g[i]) is zero (so isolated node):\n\n           ci +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           run dfs on the node i.\n\n           if dfs returns True, then cb +=1\n\n           else, cc +=1\n\nWait, but the 'len' in Python is the length of the list. In our C code's adj_entry's len is the current length. So if g[i].len ==0, then it's an isolated node.\n\nNow, the DFS function:\n\nIn Python, the dfs function uses a stack implemented via queue.LifoQueue, which is actually a stack. But in Python code, the stack is initially pushed (x,1). Then, while the stack is not empty, pop the (u, col).\n\nThen, check if already visited: vis[u] is non-zero.\n\nWait the initial Python code uses vis initialized as [0]*(n+1), so vis[u] is 0 for unvisited.\n\nWait in the Python code:\n\nvis[u] is False (0) to start. The code says:\n\nif vis[u] is True (so 1): then check if previous color matches?\n\n    flag & = (vis[u] == col)\n\nWait, but perhaps the stack's nodes may have been pushed by other pathways, so when we process a node which is already visited, we need to ensure that it's consistent.\n\nBut in the code's logic, the stack is processed, so if a node is popped from the stack (i.e. being processed), then if already visited:\n\nThen check if vis[u] matches the current col, and update the flag.\n\nWait, the code in the Python function:\n\ndef dfs(x):\n\n    stk, flag = queue.LifoQueue(), True\n\n    stk.put((x,1))\n\n    while not stk.empty():\n\n        u, col = stk.get()\n\n        if vis[u]:\n\n            flag &= (vis[u] == col)\n\n            continue\n\n        vis[u] = col\n\n        for i in g[u]:\n\n            stk.put( (i, 3 - col) )\n\n    return flag\n\nAh, so the way it's working is:\n\nEach node, when first visited (vis[u] not set), sets it to a color (col).\n\nThen pushes the children to the stack with the inverted color (3 - col).\n\nIf the color of this node is already set when this path comes back here (via another path), then that would indicate a conflict. Since the flag is a Boolean, initially True, but if any of the edges find a contradiction (vis[u] != col), that would set the flag to False.\n\nWait, but since this is a DFS, the graph is being processed, but since the nodes are visited once, so the code is essentially a bipartition check via BFS. Wait, the use of stack would make it DFS.\n\nWait but how does the flag track all the conflicts? Let me think:\n\nThe function flag starts as true. Each time a node u is popped from the stack:\n\nIf it's already visited (vis[u] !=0):\n\nCheck whether the current col (which is the intended color based on the path we're coming from) is the same as the stored color (vis[u]).\n\nIf not match, then the flag becomes flag AND (vis[u]==col) \u2192 which will turn flag to false. So any such case will makes flag become false.\n\nSo the flag is checking whether this whole component is bipartitionable.\n\nBut there's one thing: the code only checks for cycles having even lengths. So, if a node is being reconsidered via another path (not the parent's path), causing a back edge. That is, if the color alternates along the path, then it should be fine, but in cycles of odd length, the color would conflict.\n\nBut wait, the way this is implemented, when a node is first visited (when its vis is 0), then the color is set. Any other time it's visited via the stack (from another node's child), so that's not possible, but stack uses a last-in approach.\n\nHmm, but in the code, the same node can be pushed multiple times until it's processed? Wait no, once it is visited (since when popping, if it's unvisited, you immediately set the color and process the edges, pushing all children. Those children may be pushed later into the stack. However, the node will already be visited once.\n\nAh right, because when you first take u from the stack, you process it (visit if unvisited), but maybe other paths may have added it multiple times to the stack before it's been processed.\n\nWait, here's the problem.\n\nSuppose the node u has been pushed to the stack with a particular color, but before it can be processed, something else happens. Then, another path adds it to the stack again with another color. So, when you first pop it and process it, you set the color. However, the other entries in the stack with other colors might still be present.\n\nSo, in that case, the second entry for u will be popped later, but since the node is already visited (and thus the current color was set), when you check vis[u] == col, where col is the new one, then the discrepancy will be noticed and flag is updated.\n\nHmm, this logic seems sound. So whether the stack approach can handle this?\n\nWell, the algorithm's validity. Whether the function correctly checks for bipartition, perhaps yes, since the flag is being set to false as long as there exists any node which is found to have a conflicting color when revisited via another path.\n\nWait, maybe. However, I'm not entirely sure. But given that it's given in the Python code which works, we can just translate it into C.\n\nNow, translating the DFS part.\n\nFirst, we need to implement the stack with LIFO. One way in C is to use an explicit stack structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use an array for the stack, and a pointer. But since in C we can't have a built-in stack, we have to manually manage it.\n\nA stack in C can be represented as an array with a top pointer. Size can be dynamic.\n\nAlternatively, using an array of structs (u, col) and a stack with top index.\n\nBut let's consider the maximum possible size of the stack for the DFS. The worst case is when the graph is a linear chain \u2014 but in reality, since it's a graph, could be up to n elements in the stack if it's a linear chain.\n\nSo we can start with a stack that is of size n (or more). But let's assume n is up to say 1e5, then maybe a stack of size n would be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, to dynamically allocate.\n\nAlternatively, the function dfs will be implemented in C, with the stack as an array and a top index.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the stack can have duplicate items. Let me see.\n\nWait in the Python code's DFS:\n\nWhen a node is popped, and if it's already visited (so the current col may not match its current color), then we:\n\nflag & = (vis[u] == col)\n\nthen continue, i.e., not processing it further.\n\nSo the children are only added when the node is first visited.\n\nAh! Because when the node is first processed (only when it's unvisited), then you set its color, then push all its edges to the stack with the inverse color. \n\nBecause once it's being processed (and its vis set), any future entries in the stack for this node will cause us to check the color but not push again (since after setting the color once, the node is marked as visited).\n\nTherefore, the stack can have multiple entries for the same node, but only once will it be processed (i.e., the children would be pushed). That is, the first time it is popped off the stack, and found unvisited.\n\nTherefore, the function is correct in that the children are pushed only when visiting first.\n\nTherefore, in C implementation, the stack must hold elements (node, color) and be managed as a stack (last-in first-out). \n\nTo implement this stack:\n\nProbably using dynamic arrays again. So, a struct for each element in the stack {int u, int color}, with a stack array, and top index.\n\nAlternatively, since size can be up to N (size of the graph's nodes), perhaps:\n\nThe maximum stack size would be O(N) in the worst case (e.g., a chain of nodes, leading to stack of size N).\n\nThus, in C:\n\nFor the dfs function, parameters are the start node x. The function is passed, and returns a bool.\n\nWait, but variables like 'vis' need to be global? Or passed as arguments. In C function scope, but since C doesn't support defaults, better to pass pointers.\n\nAlternatively, we can make 'vis' as a global array, but in C programming contests, variables can be declared outside.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, to write the code as similar as possible to Python.\n\nOverall, the plan for the C code:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- For each edge, read u and v, and add to each of the adjacency lists.\n\n- The Visited array (vis) is an array of integers, initialized to 0.\n\n- Then loop over all nodes from 1 to n. For each:\n\n   if not visited, then process.\n\n   if the adjacency list length is 0 \u2192 isolated \u2192 count in ci.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform DFS, and see if the component is bipartitionable. based on the return, increment cb or cc.\n\n- Then, compute the formula and output.\n\nFirst, the graph:\n\nImplementing the adjacency lists with expandable arrays using realloc:\n\nUnfortunately, for code simplicity, the following steps need to be followed.\n\nWait, but since this is a code translation, perhaps the code can use adjacency lists with arrays.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Read N and M:\n\nint n, m;\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n2. Initialize variables: vis array, ci, cb, cc:\n\nint vis[n+1]; \u2192 But in C, if n is input dynamically, the array would be a VLA (variable length array in C99), which is allowed, but might require compiling with -std=c99.\n\nBut maybe better to use a dynamic array via malloc. Alternatively assuming the code uses C99.\n\nThus, in C code:\n\nint vis[n+1]; \u2192 declared in the main function.\n\nThen, the adjacency lists:\n\nLet me try to create an adjacency list using structs with dynamic arrays.\n\nFirst, the struct for each adjacency list:\n\nstruct adj_list {\n    int* edges;\n    int size;\n    int cap;\n};\n\nstruct adj_list g[n+1]; \u2264 but using VLA.\n\nWait, no because n is variable. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: declare a pointer array to struct.\n\nstruct adj_list* g; \u2192 then allocate:\n\ng = malloc( (n+1) * sizeof( struct adj_list) );\n\nThen, for each node from 0 to n, initialize their edges:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    g[i].edges = NULL;\n\n    g[i].size = 0;\n\n    g[i].cap = 0;\n\n}\n\nBut line 1 code may be different.\n\nWait in any case, here's the code step.\n\nWait actually in code.\n\nIn C, let's try to proceed step by step:\n\nFirst, in main:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nInitialize adjacency list.\n\nstruct adj_list* g = malloc( (n+1)* sizeof(struct adj_list) ); ?\n\nWait also, perhaps better to create the struct as follows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nstruct Edge\n{\n    int v;\n    struct Edge *next;\n};\n\nstruct Graph\n{\n    int numVertices;\n    struct Edge **adj;\n};\n\nThis is a linked list adjacency list structure. But then the code would have to manage all nodes' linked lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array of dynamic arrays approach.\n\nBack to the original code's approach.\n\nThe Python code's adjacency list is a list of edges for each node, stored in a list.\n\nIn C, to represent adjacency lists as arrays, for each node:\n\nstruct adj_list {\n    int *arr;  // array of adjacent nodes\n    int size;  // current size\n    int cap;   // capacity (current allocated space)\n};\n\nThen the array g is of length n+1:\n\nstruct adj_list *g = malloc( (n+1)* sizeof(struct adj_list) );\n\nfor (i in 1 to n) {\n\n    g[i].arr = NULL;\n\n    g[i].size=0;\n\n    g[i].cap =0;\n\n}\n\nThen, for adding a edge v to u's list.\n\nvoid add_edge(struct adj_list *g, int u, int v){\n\n    if (g[u].size >= g[u].cap ){\n\n    // need to realloc\n\n    if (g[u].cap ==0){\n\n        // allocate initial size\n\n        g[u].cap = 1;\n\n        g[u].arr = malloc( g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n\n    } else {\n\n        g[u].cap *=2;\n\n        g[u].arr = realloc(g[u].arr, g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    g[u].arr[ g[u].size++ ] = v;\n\n}\n\nSo adding an edge u-v would be:\n\nadd_edge(g, u, v);\n\nadd_edge(g, v, u);\n\nBut in the edges reading loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<m; i++){\n\n    int u, v;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &u, &v);\n\n    add_edge(g, u, v);\n\n    add_edge(g, v, u);\n\n}\n\nThis way, the adjacency lists are properly maintained.\n\nOkay, now, the DFS function:\n\nThe DFS function needs to:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of (node, color) pairs.\n\nInitialize the stack. \n\nThe stack can be represented as an array of structs { int u; int col; }, with a dynamic size.\n\nWait, perhaps again with a VLA or using dynamic arrays. Since stack can be of up to n elements.\n\nAlternatively, inside the DFS function, we can use an array for stack.\n\nFirst, the function signature:\n\nint dfs( struct adj_list*g, int x, int *vis );\n\nWait but need to return a flag. All variables are pointers.\n\nWait the Vis array is declared in main, so it's global-ish. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the DFS function needs to have access to 'vis' which is passed as a pointer. \n\nWait, implementing this:\n\nFunction would look like:\n\nint dfs( int x, int *vis, struct adj_list *g, int n ){\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nBut let me think.\n\nAlternatively, having the vis array, and the graph g are global, to simplify passing parameters. But perhaps better to pass as arguments.\n\nBut since the function is inside the main, we can make them global variables.\n\nAlternatively, in C code:\n\nThe parameters would be necessary. Let me see.\n\nBut let's think of implementing the DFS function:\n\nThe stack needs to be a dynamic array of elements (u, col). Let's handle this with a struct.\n\nAlternatively, for the stack, the code can have a structure that holds an array of (u, col), and a top pointer.\n\nAlternatively, the following variables can be stack arrays:\n\nA stack for u nodes, another stack for colors.\n\nWith the stack size also dynamic but allocated initially as a very large array.\n\nWait, but in practice, the maximum possible depth can be up to n nodes (if the graph is a straight line), so stack size of n is sufficient. So pre-allocate an array of size n.\n\nAssuming n is up to say 1e5, but in code, perhaps we can.\n\nWait in the DFS code, the function is called for a component. The maximum stack size would be the number of nodes in the component. But for the worst case, the whole graph could be a chain, needing a stack of size n.\n\nThus, declaring stack arrays:\n\nstruct StackNode {\n    int u;\n    int col;\n};\n\n#define MAX_STACK_SIZE (1000000) // something big enough, based on problem constraints?\n\nThen, in the DFS function, we can have a fixed size array:\n\nstruct StackNode stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE];\n\n int top =0; \n\nBut the function must be implemented with variables declared inside.\n\nAlternatively, code the DFS as follows:\n\nint dfs(struct adj_list *g, int start, int *vis ){\n\n    struct StackNode stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE]; // but depends on N.\n\n    int top =-1;\n\n    int flag = 1;\n\n    //Push initial node:\n\n    stack[++top].u = start;\n\n    stack[top].col =1;\n\n    while (top >=0 ){\n\n        int u = stack[top].u;\n\n        int col = stack[top].col;\n\n        top--;\n\n        // pop: now u and col are taken from the stack.\n\n        // Now process this.\n\n        if (vis[u] ) {\n\n            // Already visited check.\n\n            if ( vis[u] != col ){\n\n                flag =0;\n\n            }\n\n            continue;\n\n        }\n\n        vis[u] = col;\n\n        // Push all neighbors with inverted color.\n\n        for (int i=0; i<g[u].size; i++){\n\n            // adjacent node v\n\n            int v = g[u].arr[i];\n\n            stack[++top].u = v;\n\n            stack[top].col = 3 - col;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // After processing all?\n\n    // Wait but the stack is processed in LIFO order.\n\n    Wait wait, perhaps I have messed up the LIFO.\n\nLet me re-examine the code.\n\nWait the Python code uses the LIFO queue (like stack) and uses get(), which is the last-in, first out.\n\nIn the code, the popped items (u, col) should be the first in the stack's last-in.\n\nWait in C:\n\nWhen pushing, the stack array is built with stack[0] as the bottom or stack[1] etc.\n\nIn the code:\n\nwhen pushing, top increments after the assignment? So, stack[++top], so when you do that, starts at 0, then 1 etc.\n\nThen, the first item is at 0, then when you pop (take top down).\n\nWait no the code above is:\n\nAfter the push, when you get an item, you do:\n\ntop--; \u2192 so the item is stack[top+1], took it off.\n\nWait stack[top] is the top of the stack before popping (the top element). Hmm.\n\nWait let's do an example:\n\nfirst, at top =0 after pushing the first element. So:\n\nstart element is at top=0 (after incrementing).\n\nThen, the while (top >=0 ):\n\nthen:\n\nu= stack[top].u, which is the first element, then the top reduces to -1.\n\nBut then processing that element (start node):\n\nSince it is unvisited (assuming vis started at 0), then its color is set to 'col', which was 1.\n\nThen, for all its neighbors, v, we push them into the stack with color 3-col.\n\nSo the next items added are the neighbors. After that, the loop continues. The next items will be popped in the reverse order of pushing.\n\nWait because we pushed them in order and pop last-in-first-out.\n\nHmm, so this is a proper LIFO stack.\n\nThus, the code should process the node 'u' first. However, there is a complication:\n\nThe code above takes the node 'u' from the stack, checks if it is visited \u2014 if already visited (vis[u] not 0):\n\nthen check if the current 'col' (given the path's current expectation) equals the color recorded in vis. If yes, proceed; if not, set flag false.\n\nThen, processing continues. Else (if the current node wasn't visited), set its vis to col, then push all neighbors into the stack with 3-col.\n\nWait but wait, the above code is not exactly capturing the Python logic:\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nEach time you pop from the stack (regardless of the visited state), you first check if the node is visited. If it is visited, then you check whether the current intended color (col) matches the stored vis[u]. The discrepancy is captured into flag.\n\nBut, the code in the Python leaves the node unmarked (but it's considered as already visited) and says continue \u2192 skipping the coloring.\n\nWait but in the code:\n\nWait in Python:\n\nif vis[u]:\n\n    flag & = (vis[u] == col)\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    vis[u] = col \u2192 mark the node as visited.\n\n    push all children into stack (next step)\n\nThus, in the C code:\n\nWe do check if (vis[u] !=0) \u2192 if so, we compare and then, continue to the next iteration (without further processing)\n\nThus, in the C code's example above, the code path is correct.\n\nNow, the key issue is, how is flag updated. In the C code above, when a discrepancy is found (vis[u] != col), then flag is set to 0 (because it pre-assumes flag is 1 \u2192 but there could be multiple places where it is set to 0.\n\nWait in Python:\n\nflag is initially True.\n\nEach time any such discrepancy, the flag &= (expression).\n\nThus, in the C code, to mimic it, whenever you encounter a node that is already visited with conflicting color, the flag must be set to False.\n\nThus in C:\n\nWe can have a flag variable initialized as 1, then each violation sets it to 0 (since any violation would make the flag false).\n\nWait but in the original Python code, the flag accumulates AND the condition. Thus, in Python, the flag is true only if all such conditions evaluate to true. So an initial 1 (flag = 1), then flag is AND'ed with the comparison.\n\nBut if it's found to be false, you keep flag as false until the end.\n\nTherefore, in C, we can do:\n\n    flag remains 1 only if all checks are okay.\n\n    So, initially set flag = 1.\n\n    then during the processing:\n\n        if (vis[u] !=0 and vis[u] != col):\n\n            flag =0;\n\nand thereafter, remains 0.\n\nHence the flag variable can be set to 0 once a discrepancy is found and stay that way.\n\nThus, the C code inside the function can do that:\n\nThus:\n\nint flag =1;\n\n// inside the while loop:\n\nif ( vis[u] !=0 ) {\n\n    if (vis[u] != col) {\n\n        flag =0;\n\n    }\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\n// process unvisited node\n\n// push the children.\n\nSo this way, any such discrepancy sets flag to 0.\n\nProceed until entire stack is processed.\n\nThus, the code will return flag which is either 1 or 0.\n\nThus, the C code for the DFS is structured as follows.\n\nNow, the problem with the C code as outlined earlier:\n\nThe stack is processed as:\n\nInitially pushing (start, 1).\n\nThen, in the while loop, popping the top element ( LIFO order ).\n\nProcessing each element.\n\nNow, in this code, the problem is that, after popping the current element (u, col), that's what is being handled.\n\nNow, the code may have an error in the way the stack is handled. For instance, when pushing all the children of the current node (u), we push them in the loop:\n\n   for all v in g[u]'s edges:\n\n     push v with 3-col.\n\nThus, the next element on stack is the last of these children, which will be the next to be processed.\n\nThis ensures that the elements are in LIFO (stack) order, thus the DFS order.\n\nSo the stack code seems correct.\n\nNow, the function needs to return whether all the checks pass (flag).\n\nThus, the code can return flag >0 (since flag is 1 or 0).\n\nThus the function returns (flag) as the 'okay' status.\n\nNow, putting this all together, the code for the DFS function is:\n\nBut note that, in C, the variables 'vis' and the graph g need to be passed in to the function.\n\nWait, in my earlier draft, I have:\n\nint dfs( struct adj_list *g, int x, int *vis ){\n\n    struct StackNode stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE]; // but MAX_STACK_SIZE needs to be declared?\n\n    ... \n\n    The problem is that MAX_STACK_SIZE has to be sufficiently large, but how?\n\nAssuming n can be up to 1e5, then 1e5 elements could require a stack that big, but dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, in C99, variable length arrays can be used.\n\nWait:\n\n\u4fee\u6539:\n\ntypedef struct {\n\n    int u;\n\n    int col;\n\n} StackNode;\n\nint dfs(struct adj_list *g, int x, int* vis) {\n\n    StackNode stack[ n ]; // assuming n is known (it's passed somehow).\n\n    int top = -1;\n\n    int flag = 1;\n\n    stack[++top] = (StackNode) {x, 1};\n\n    while (top >=0) {\n\n        // pop the top element\n\n        StackNode curr = stack[top];\n\n        top--;\n\n        int u = curr.u;\n\n        int col = curr.col;\n\n        if (vis[u]) {\n\n            // Check the color\n\n            if (vis[u] != col) {\n\n                flag = 0;\n\n            }\n\n            continue;\n\n        }\n\n        // Mark as visited.\n\n        vis[u] = col;\n\n        // Push all children with 3-col.\n\n        for (int i =0; i<g[u].size; i++) {\n\n            int v = g[u].arr[i];\n\n            stack[++top] = (StackNode) {v, 3 - col};\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return flag;\n\n}\n\nWait but since this function is inside a function (or main) where 'n' is known, and 'stack[n]' can be a VLA.\n\nBut yes, assuming that n can be the maximum possible component size, but the stack size is at most n. So initializing it with size n would be okay.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with that.\n\nHowever, since the components can be of size n (in a worst-case tree). Thus, using a stack size of n is sufficient.\n\nNow, in the function, we can update 'vis' arrays which are passed as pointers.\n\nThus, in the DFS function, the parameters are the graph, the starting node, and the pointer to the vis array.\n\nThis requires that the DFS function knows about the graph structure.\n\nWait, but in the C code I've been planning earlier, the graph is represented as a struct adj_list array, so the function can take a struct adj_list *g as a parameter.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn the main function:\n\nstruct adj_list *g;\n\nDeclaring the variables is important.\n\nNow, let me try to outline the code.\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nstruct adj_list {\n    int *edges;\n    int size;\n    int cap;\n};\n\nvoid add_edge(struct adj_list *g, int u, int v) {\n    if (g[u].size >= g[u].cap) {\n        // need to expand\n        if (g[u].cap == 0) {\n            g[u].cap = 1;\n            g[u].edges = malloc(g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n        } else {\n            g[u].cap *= 2;\n            g[u].edges = realloc(g[u].edges, g[u].cap * sizeof(int));\n        }\n    }\n    g[u].edges[g[u].size++] = v;\n}\n\nint dfs(struct adj_list *g, int x, int *vis, int n) {\n    typedef struct {\n        int u;\n        int col;\n    } StackNode;\n\n    StackNode stack[n]; // requires C99 VLA\n    int top = -1;\n    int flag = 1;\n\n    stack[++top] = (StackNode){x, 1};\n\n    while (top >= 0) {\n        StackNode curr = stack[top];\n        top--;\n        int u = curr.u;\n        int col = curr.col;\n\n        if (vis[u]) {\n            if (vis[u] != col) {\n                flag = 0;\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        vis[u] = col;\n        for (int i = 0; i < g[u].size; ++i) {\n            int v = g[u].edges[i];\n            stack[++top] = (StackNode){v, 3 - col};\n        }\n    }\n\n    return flag;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    struct adj_list *g = malloc( (n + 1) * sizeof(struct adj_list));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n        g[i].edges = NULL;\n        g[i].size = 0;\n        g[i].cap = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i =0; i<m; i++) {\n        int u, v;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &u, &v);\n        add_edge(g, u, v);\n        add_edge(g, v, u);\n    }\n\n    int vis[n+1];\n    memset(vis, 0, (n+1)*sizeof(int));\n\n    int ci=0, cb=0, cc=0;\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        if (vis[i] ==0) {\n            // not visited\n            if (g[i].size ==0) {\n                ci++;\n            } else {\n                int res = dfs(g, i, vis, n);\n                if (res) {\n                    cb++;\n                } else {\n                    cc++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // compute the result\n    long long total = (long long)ci * ci;\n    total += 2LL * ci * (n - ci);\n    total += (long long)cc * cc;\n    total += 2LL * cb * cc;\n    total += 2LL * cb * cb;\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", total);\n\n    // cleanup\n\n    // Free memory for each edges:\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; ++i){\n        free(g[i].edges);\n    }\n    free(g);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHmm, but I have to check all the details.\n\nWait, in the DFS function:\n\nThe for loop is iterating over the adjacency list of u, which is g[u].edges from 0 to g[u].size-1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: the vis[u] array must be initialized to 0.\n\nYes, done with memset.\n\nNow, in the code, when we process a node i:\n\nif g[i].size ==0 \u2192 so isolated node \u2192 increment ci.\n\nElse:\n\nrun DFS (i) \u2192 returns whether it's bipartition-able (res). If yes \u2192 cb else cc.\n\nThe formula:\n\nThe output is computed as per Python's code: \n\nci * ci + 2 * ci*(n-ci) + cc*cc + 2*cb*cc + 2*(cb)^2 ?\n\nWait the original Python formula:\n\nci*ci + 2*ci*(n - ci) + cc*cc + 2 * cb * cc + 2 * cb * cb.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= (ci^2 + cc^2) \n\n+ (2 ci (n-c)) where c is what? n-c is the non ci terms (others)\n\nBut also + 2 cc * cb \n\n+ 2 * (cb)^2.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step.\n\nThe Python code prints:\n\nprint( ci * ci + 2 * ci * (n - ci) + cc * cc + 2 * cb * cc + 2 * cb * cb )\n\nBreaking terms:\n\nThe terms are:\n\nci\u00b2 \n\nplus 2*ci*(n-c_i)\n\nplus cc\u00b2 \n\nplus 2*cb*cc \n\nplus 2*cb\u00b2 \n\nWait I think the code calculates (ci + cc)^2 + (cb + cb + ...) ?\n\nWait perhaps the formula originates from some combinatorial count. But the code needs to be translated correctly.\n\nIn the C code, variables are integers:\n\nWe can cast them to long long to prevent overflow. So in C:\n\ntotal = (long long)(ci * ci);\n\nBut in the code above I did that correctly.\n\nNow, the variables cb, cc, and ci are all counters.\n\nThus the C code in the main function for the formula is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code:\n\nFor example, if there's an isolated node and the rest form an even cycle:\n\nLet's say n=3, m=0:\n\nThen all nodes are isolated:\n\nci would be 3.\n\nThe computed total is 3\u00b2 + 2*3*(0) + ... \n\nBut no, m is 0:\n\nEach node has g[i].size 0 \u2192 so ci =3.\n\nSo total is\n\n3^2 + 2*3*(0) + 0 + 0 + 2*0 \u2192 9.\n\nYes, so formula would be 3*3 + 0 ... etc =\n\n3\u00b2 + 2*3*0 = 9. Correct because from ci^2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample where a bipartitionable and an un.\n\nWait, but considering the C code could be correct.\n\nThus, the C code seems functional.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nThe dynamic array functions (add_edge) might have stack overflow or realloc errors, but they are properly handled by doubling the capacity.\n\nThe StackNode stack uses a variable length array (VLA), which may require C99 support. Some code may need to compile with -std=c99.\n\nThe nodes start at 1, and everything is read properly.\n\nNow, for the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)...\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: the code in the function dfs:\n\nThe 'stack' declares a struct array of size n. Since n is input, but the recursion depth can't be more than n. that should work.\n\nTesting the code with a case like a triangle (which is odd cycle, can\u2019t be bipartitioned):\n\nTest case:\n\nn=3, m=3 edges:\n\nEdges 1-2, 2-3, 3-1.\n\nThe graph is a cycle of three nodes.\n\nThen, for this component, the DFS returns false (flag=0), thus counted as cc +=1.\n\nThe other terms (ci is0, cb 0, cc is1).\n\nThe formula computes:\n\nci=0, so first terms:\n\n0 + 0 + cc*cc (1) + 2 * 0 *1 = 1 + 0 + ...2*cb\u00b2 ?\n\nWait:\n\nTotal = 0 + 0 \u2192 + 1 (cc*cc) + 0 (2 * cb *cc ) + 2*(0)^2 \u2192 total is1. \n\nWait but the Python code code would compute 1^2 + ...?\n\nThe output would be 1 (cc is1). But the code:\n\ncc * cc =1 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nThus, the code would work.\n\nHope this is correct."
