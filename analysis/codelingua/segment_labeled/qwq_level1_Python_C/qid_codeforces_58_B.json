Wait, but there's a catch here. Because when n is updated to i, that might affect the next iterations. Hmm. Oh right, because once you hit a divisor, you set n to that divisor, so the next iterations will be looking for divisors of the new smaller n, not the original n. \n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. The loop is from the original n down to 1, but when inside the loop, if you set n = i, that might interfere with the loop's iteration steps. Because in Python, the for loop's iteration variable is part of the range that was generated at the start. So changing n inside the loop might not affect the loop's iteration steps. Wait, the range is created before the loop starts, so even if you modify n inside the loop, the loop will continue using the original range. So the key here is that the for loop in Python runs from the initial value of n down to 1, stepping down by 1 each time.\n\nWait, but the code isn't just iterating through the list of divisors. Let me see the code again. The loop is for i in range(n, 0, -1). The start is n, stop is 0 (since it's exclusive). So each time, the loop goes from original n down to 1. Then for each i in that list from original n down, we check if the current n is divisible by i. But the problem is, the code is using n % i == 0, but n could be changing in the loop. Because if a divisor is found, the code then sets n to i, which might change the n for subsequent checks. Wait, but the loop is over the original list. For example, suppose n is 6. The initial range is 6,5,4,3,2,1. \n\nFirst i is 6. 6 % 6 is 0. So yes, so set n to 6 (which doesn't change here), then print 6. Next iteration, next i is 5. Now the current n would be 6 until this point. Wait, after the first iteration, the code's n is now 6, so next i is 5. Check if 6 mod 5 is 0? 6 mod5 is 1, so no. So move on. Then i is 4. 6 mod4 is 2. Not divisible. Then i is 3. 6 mod3 is 0. So now, set n to 3, then print 3. Next, the next i is 2 (still looping through original range). The current n is 3 now. So check 3 mod2: 3 mod2 is 1. Not divisible. Next i is 1. 3 mod1 is 0. So set n=1. Print 1. \n\nThe printed output would be 6 3 1.\n\nSo the process is, for each number in the original list (from N down to 1), it checks whether current n is divisible by i. If yes, then n becomes i, and print it. But the loop continues to iterate over the remaining numbers in the original sequence. Wait, no\u2014because the for loop in Python uses the initial range.

Because the loop's i is separate, so we can have:\n\noriginal_n = input_n.\n\nWait, so perhaps first, we need to store the original value of n (the input value) because the loop increments or decrements the loop variable, and n is modified. \n\nWait, the Python code's loop uses the original value of n as the starting point. Therefore, in C, to replicate that, we should create a loop variable that starts at the original n and goes down to 1, decrementing by 1 each step, while keeping track of the original n.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFirst, get n from input.\n\nThen, we need to iterate i from n down to 1:\n\nfor (i = n; i >= 1; i--)\n\nInside the loop, check if (original_n % i ==0). Wait, no, in the Python code, it's n %i, but n is modified during the loop. Hmm. Oh right, that complicates things.\n\nBecause in the Python code, after the for loop's iteration starts, the n can be changed, so when checking for the next i, it uses the possibly updated n.\n\nWait, let me think through an example again. Suppose original n is 5.\n\nFirst i is 5. Check if 5 mod5 is 0? yes. So set n to 5. Wait, but it was already 5. So nothing changes. So print 5. Then next i is 4. The n is still 5. Check 5 mod4: 1, not divisible. Then i is 3: 5 mod3 is 2. Not. Then i=2: 5 mod2 is 1. Then i=1: 5 mod1 is 0. So set n=1, print 1. The output would be 5 1.\n\nWait but in the original Python example with n=6, after going to 3, then when i=2, 3 mod2 is 1 (so no), then i=1, 3 mod1 is 0. So yes, and set to 1. So 6,3,1.\n\nSo the algorithm is: iterate from original n down to 1. for each i in that sequence, check if current n is divisible by i. If yes: set n =i, and print it.\n\nTherefore, the value of n can decrease over time as the loop continues. But the iteration of the for loop isn't affected because the loop's steps depend on the original n, not the current.\n\nSo, to replicate this in C, the variable that tracks the original n is important.\n\nWait, maybe in C, we need to have an outer loop over the numbers i, from original n down to 1. The original n is stored. So in code:\n\nint original = n; // when we got it.\n\nThen loop i from original down to 1:\n\nfor (i = original; i >=1; i--){\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, we check whether the current value of n (which we are modifying) is divisible by i. If yes, then set n to i and print.\n\nWait, but in C, in that for loop, we can do that:\n\nWait. Here's the plan.\n\nRead n.\n\nint original = n;\n\nint current_n = n;\n\nthen the loop over i from original down to 1:\n\nfor (int i = original; i >= 1; i--){\n\n    if( current_n % i ==0 ){\n\n        current_n = i;\n\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, is that the right approach?\n\nWait, no, let's think again. Wait, in the Python code, the for loop is from the original n down to 0 (but stopping at 1). But each time the code uses the current n in the calculation. Wait, in the Python code, when doing n%i, is the n the original or the updated?\n\nYes, in the Python code, each iteration computes the current value of n mod by the current i (which comes from the original n). So in C, the code as I had above could work, but only if the current_n is the live value. \n\nWait, let's test this example:\n\nTake example where original is 6, current starts as 6.\n\nThen start with i=6. Check 6 mod6 is 0. So current becomes 6 (no change). Print 6.\n\nThen i=5. Check 6 mod5? Wait, wait no\u2014the current_n after first step is 6. So 6 mod5 is 1, so no. So not divisible. So nothing happens.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4: 2. Not.\n\ni=3: current_n is 6. 6 mod3 is 0. So yes: current becomes 3. Print 3.\n\ni=2: now current is 3. current%2 is 3%2 is 1. Not. So no.\n\ni=1: current is still 3. current mod1 is 0. So current becomes 1, print 1.\n\nSo the output is 6 3 1. Which matches what the Python does.\n\nSo the code in C would work with the structure I suggested.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nWait, but in C, when we write that code, the loop would be:\n\nWait, so:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, original, current;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    original = n;\n\n    current =n;\n\n    for(int i = original; i >=1; i--){\n\n        if( current%i ==0 ){\n\n            current =i;\n\n            printf(\"%d \",i);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but this code is correct?\n\nYes. Let's test it with the example given above n=6, it should output 6 3 1.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\nOriginal is 5.\n\ni=5: 5 mod5=0. Print5, current is5.\n\ni=4: current is5. 5 mod4 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: 5 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: same 5 mod2 \u21921, no.\n\ni=1: 5 mod1 \u21920. So set to 1, print \u2192 so output is 5 1. Which matches the Python example.\n\nAnother test case: n=4.\n\nOriginal 4:\n\ni=4: current is 4 \u2192 yes. print4.\n\ni=3: 4 mod3 \u21921 \u2192no.\n\ni=2: 4 mod2 \u21920 \u2192 yes \u2192 current becomes 2. Print2.\n\ni=1: 2 mod1 \u21920 \u2192 becomes1, print1.\n\nSo the output would be4 2 1. Let's see:\n\nWait, in the original Python code loop steps:\n\nStart with n=4.\n\nloop i=4: yes, so n=4 (no change). Print4.\n\nNext i is3: check n=4 mod3 is 1, no.\n\ni=2: 4 mod2 \u21920. So n becomes 2, then print 2.\n\nThen i=1: current is 2 mod1 \u21920. So n becomes1 and printed. Output 4 2 1.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2:\n\nOriginal 2:\n\ni=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 print2. current remains 2.\n\ni=1 \u2192 2 mod1 =0 \u2192 current becomes 1 \u2192 print1.\n\nSo output is 2 1. Which is correct.\n\nAh, but wait, in the original code, when the current gets updated, the next i's are from the original, so when current changes, but the iteration continues. So this code should work correctly.\n\nSo the code in C should be as above.\n\nWait, but the variables: when we declare, we need to read n first.\n\nWait, in the C code:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int original = n;\n\n    int current = n;\n\n    for (int i = original; i >=1; i--){\n\n        if (current % i ==0){\n\n            current =i;\n\n            printf(\"%d \",i);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the first print is the i, which is the same as the first divisor in the loop.\n\nTherefore, this C code should duplicate the Python's behavior correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=7 (a prime).\n\nOriginal is7.\n\nThen:\n\ni=7 \u2192 yes \u2192 print7; current remains7.\n\nThen i=6: 7%6 =1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=5:7%5 \u21922, etc. Until i=2:7 mod all down to 1 except 1 and7 would fail.\n\ni=1: 7%1=0, so current becomes1 and printed. So output is 7 1. Which matches the Python code.\n\nYes.\n\nHmm, so this code should do. Now, the only thing left is writing that code properly in C.\n\nWait the variables:\n\nMust read n from input. So scanf.\n\nNow, we can omit the original variable, as it's same as the initial n. Since the loop is from n dowm to1, so:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nint n, current;\n\nscanf(\"%d\",&n);\n\ncurrent =n;\n\nfor( int i = n; i>0; i-- ){\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nHmm, but the code is same.\n\nThus, the translated code would be as shown.\n\nNow, in the problem's answer, they want the C code. \n\nSo the C code is:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, current;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    current = n;\n    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {\n        if (current % i == 0) {\n            current = i;\n            printf(\"%d \", i);\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis seems right.\n\nWait, but the user might expect the same sequence. Let me check for n=6 again. The code's loop steps through 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nAt i=3:\n\nAt that point, when i=3, current is still 6 (since after 6 and 5 and 4, those didn't change current except the first step at 6).\n\nWait let me trace step by step for n=6:\n\nInitial current=6. \n\ni=6 \u2192 yes. current stays 6. print6.\n\ni=5: current is6 \u21926%5 is1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4:6%4 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3:6 mod3 is0. So current becomes3 and is printed. 3 \u2192 so next, when i=2, current is3.\n\ni=2 \u2192 check 3%2 \u21921 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1 \u21923%1=0 \u2192 yes. current becomes1 and printed1. \n\nSo the output is 6 3 1. Correct.\n\nYes, so this code works. \n\nSo that's the correct C translation."
