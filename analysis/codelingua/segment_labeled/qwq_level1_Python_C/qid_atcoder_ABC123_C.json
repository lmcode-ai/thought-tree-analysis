For example, n=6 and min=5 \u2192 6/5 is 1.2 \u2192 ceil is 2 \u2192 adding 4 gives 6.\n\nBut in code, let's see:\n\ndiv is 6/5=1.2 \u2192 ceil gives 2 \u2192 2 +4 =6 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm okay.\n\nNow, possible issues in the code.\n\nWait, in C, I need to include math library. Because ceil is in math.h, so I need to:\n\n#include <math.h>\n\nand also include stdio.h for input/output.\n\nSo in C code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    ... as above ...\n}\n\nAnother point: in the Python code, the list A is created with 5 elements using a loop from 0 to 4; but in C, the array is 5 elements, 0-4.\n\nThe rest is handled.\n\nWait another thing: when using scanf, if the input has any errors, but assuming inputs are correct as per problem constraints, so no problem.\n\nAlso, note that in the problem's code, after getting the list of A's elements (5 elements), the code uses min(A), which in Python's min function. So the code in C correctly finds the minimal value of the array.\n\nNow, putting all the pieces together, here's the C code.\n\nWait the code in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int A[5];\n    for(int i = 0; i <5; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n    }\n    int min = A[0];\n    for(int i=1; i <5; i++) {\n        if(A[i] < min) {\n            min = A[i];\n        }\n    }\n    double div = (double)N / min;\n    int ceil_val = ceil(div);\n    int result = ceil_val +4;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can optimize a bit. The 'result' variable is not needed, you can inline it into the printf.\n\nAlternatively, you can combine the calculation into one line in the printf. But for readability, probably better to keep as is.\n\nWait but let me check: in C, when you cast (double) N, division will be a floating point division. \n\nAlso, check that in cases where min_A is zero? But since the problem probably requires the input to have positive integers, because otherwise division by zero would occur. So assuming that the input is valid, the code is okay.\n\nTherefore the C translation is as written above."
