      "text": "Okay, I need to translate the given Python code into C. Let me think through how to approach this step by step. First, the Python code starts by reading an integer from input. In C, I can use scanf for that. The variable 'age' is straightforward. Next, there's an if-else condition. If age is exactly 1, it prints 'Hello World'. Else, it reads two integers and prints their sum. In C, the structure would involve main returning int, and using proper headers. Let's start with the framework:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int age;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &age);\n\n    if (age == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in Python, the two numbers are read using a list comprehension with two iterations. So in C, after the else, we need two separate scanf calls? Or maybe one scanf that reads two numbers in a row. Since in Python, each input() would be a separate line perhaps?
