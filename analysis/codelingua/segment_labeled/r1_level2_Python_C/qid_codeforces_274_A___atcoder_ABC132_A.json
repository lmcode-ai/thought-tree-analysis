So we can store temp as an int? But note: the set size is the number of distinct numbers we added. It is an integer, and at most num (which is int). So we can use int for temp. Then when converting to string: we can use:\n\n            char str[20];\n            sprintf(str, \"%d\", temp);   // if temp is int. But wait: we used long long for the array and the set, but the set size (the count) is an int. So we'll use:\n\n            int num, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &num, &k);\n            long long *arr = (long long*)malloc(num * sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then read the next line: num integers? But they are long long? for (int i=0; i<num; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n        Then we sort: we can use qsort? \n\n            qsort(arr, num, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long va = *(long long*)a;\n                long long vb = *(long long*)b;\n                if (va < vb) return -1;\n                if (va > vb) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n   Step 9: Now we have a string `str` (which is the output of the first program) and we use it as the input for the second program.",

Else, for each character in Sa, check if the frequency is 2 -> if any is not 2, print \"No\", else \"Yes\". But note: the string S is the string representation of the integer temp. Example: \n            temp=12 -> S=\"12\": \n                distinct: {'1','2'} -> size=2 -> then frequency of '1' is 1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\".

It requires that each distinct character appears exactly twice. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) { if (freq[i] ! = 0 && freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                        printf(\"No\\n\");\n                        return 0;   // but note: we are in the main function? \n                    }\n                }\n                printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n            }\n\n        But note: the distinct_count is 2, so we iterate over the two characters? We break at the first that is not 2? Alternatively, we can break early. However, we can also note: the string might have more than two characters? Example: temp=1122 -> string \"1122\": distinct_count=2? \n            distinct characters: '1' and '2'. frequency of '1': 2, frequency of '2':2 -> valid. But the string \"1112\": \n            distinct characters: '1' and '2' -> distinct_count=2.\n            frequency of '1':3 -> not 2 -> we print \"No\". This matches.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs to be executed in sequence.\n The first program reads two integers (num and k) and then an array of 'num' integers.\n It processes the array and prints an integer.\n\n The second program reads a string S and then checks two conditions:\n   (a) if the string has exactly 2 distinct characters, and\n   (b) if each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n It prints \"Yes\" if both conditions are met, otherwise \"No\".\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is used as input to the second.\n But wait: the first program prints an integer, and the second program expects a string.\n\n This discrepancy indicates that we must reinterpret the problem.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n In the first program, the output is the integer `temp` (which is printed).\n\n The second program expects a string. So we must note that the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input to the second program.\n\n How? The second program reads a string. Therefore, the integer from the first program must be converted to a string and then fed as the input to the second program.\n\n But note: the example input for the first program is:\n   First input: two integers and then an array of integers (on the next line).\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" meaning that the entire chain starts with the initial input.\n\n So the entire input for the chain is:\n   First line: two integers (num and k)\n   Second line: num integers (the array)\n\n Then the first program produces an integer output.\n\n Then the second program takes that integer (as a string) as its input? But note the second program expects a string that might not be a number.\n\n However, the second program is designed to check if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n Therefore, the output of the first program (an integer) when converted to a string must form the input for the second program.\n\n Example: \n   Suppose the first program outputs 12. Then the input to the second program is the string \"12\".\n\n Now, let's see what the second program does with \"12\":\n   Distinct characters: {'1', '2'} -> length 2 -> condition (a) satisfied.\n   Count of '1' is 1, count of '2' is 1 -> condition (b) fails (needs to be 2 each).\n\n Therefore, the second program would output \"No\".\n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs 1122? Actually, the first program outputs a single integer. So the output is a string representation of that integer.\n\n For example, if the first program outputs 1122, then the string is \"1122\". \n   Distinct characters: {'1','2'} -> 2 distinct -> condition (a) satisfied.\n   Count of '1': 2, count of '2': 2 -> condition (b) satisfied -> \"Yes\".\n\n However, note that the first program's output is an integer. The integer cannot have leading zeros? Actually, the integer can be any nonnegative integer? The problem does not specify, but note that the array elements are integers and k is positive.\n\n How do we reconcile?\n\n The problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n We must combine both programs. The entire input is the first two lines (as described). The first program runs on that and produces an integer. Then we convert that integer to a string and that becomes the input for the second program.\n\n However, note: the second program does not read two lines. It reads one string. So the entire chain input is two lines, and then the chain produces one output (the output of the second program).\n\n Steps in C:\n   Step 1: Read the first line: two integers (num and k).\n   Step 2: Read the second line: an array of 'num' integers.\n\n   Step 3: Run the logic of the first program to compute an integer result (let's call it temp).\n\n   Step 4: Convert temp to a string.\n\n   Step 5: Use that string as the input for the second program.\n\n   Step 6: The second program will check:\n        - The string has exactly 2 distinct characters? \n        - And each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n\n   Step 7: Print \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Important: The problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we must not print the intermediate integer and then read it again. We are to simulate the chain without I/O for the intermediate step.\n\n Therefore, we design:\n\n   Read the initial input (two lines) and store the two integers and the array.\n\n   Process the array as in the first program to compute an integer `temp`.\n\n   Then, convert `temp` to a string. Note: we must be cautious because the integer might be 0? Also, negative? The problem says the array elements are integers, but note the first line: num and k. k is positive (from the condition in the first program: x % k). Also, the array elements: the example does not specify, but the condition in the first program uses modulus and integer division. The problem does not say nonnegative, but the set and modulus operations are defined for negative? However, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n        In Python, the modulus has the same sign as the divisor (which is positive k). So negative numbers are handled.\n\n   But note: the first program uses `x // k` which in Python is floor division. For negative numbers, floor division rounds towards -infinity. In C, for negative numbers, division truncates toward zero. However, we must be cautious.\n\n   However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must mimic the Python behavior.\n\n   But let's look at the condition: \n        if (x % k != 0 or not x // k in different)\n\n   In Python, for negative x: \n        Example: x = -3, k = 2: \n            -3 % 2 -> 1 (because -3 = -2*2 + 1) -> so condition (x % k != 0) is true (1 != 0) -> then we add x (which is -3) to the set.\n\n   In C, the modulus for negative numbers: \n        -3 % 2 -> in C, it is -1 (if the system follows truncation towards zero). But note: C99 standard says the sign of the modulus follows the dividend. However, we can use the following to mimic Python: \n        We can adjust the modulus to be nonnegative? \n\n   Alternatively, we note that the condition in the first program is designed to avoid including a number if it is a multiple of k and the quotient (x//k) is already in the set. But for negative numbers, the condition might be different.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the input constraints. We are to mimic the Python program. Since the original is in Python, we must replicate the logic exactly.\n\n   How to handle negative in C? We can compute modulus and division in a Python-like way.\n\n   We can define:\n        int mod = x % k;\n        if (mod < 0) mod += k;   // to make it nonnegative\n        int quotient = x / k; \n        But note: when x is negative and mod is adjusted, then the quotient should be adjusted accordingly? Actually, in the condition we use `x // k` which in Python is floor division.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid by using: \n        if (x < 0) {\n            quotient = (x - k + 1) / k;   // This is one way to get floor division? \n        }\n        else {\n            quotient = x / k;\n        }\n\n   However, a more straightforward way is to use:\n\n        long long quotient;   // use long long to avoid overflow?\n        if (x >= 0) {\n            quotient = x / k;\n        } else {\n            // For negative: we adjust to get floor division.\n            quotient = (x - k + 1) / k;\n        }\n\n   But note: the set `different` stores the original numbers (x) not the quotients. The condition checks the quotient only when x is divisible by k? Actually, the condition is: \n        if (x % k != 0 OR ...) \n        so if x is not divisible by k, then we add x. But if it is divisible, then we check if the quotient (x//k) is in the set? Actually, the set contains the original numbers (x). But note: we are storing x, not the quotient. So the condition checks: \n            if the quotient (x//k) is in the set? But the set contains numbers from the array, not quotients.\n\n   This leads to a problem: the condition is checking a quotient (which might not be an element of the array) against the set of array elements? \n\n   Example: \n        k=2, array: [2, 4]\n        For 4: 4%2==0 -> then we check if 4//2=2 is in the set? \n        At the time of processing 4, we have already added 2? \n        So we do not add 4? \n\n   But note: the set `different` is built as we go? And we are processing in sorted order? \n\n   The algorithm:\n        Sort the array.\n        Then traverse each element x:\n            if x is not divisible by k -> then add x to the set.\n            else (divisible by k) -> then check if the quotient (x//k) is in the set? \n                if the quotient is in the set -> then we skip adding x?\n                else -> add x.\n\n        However, note: the condition is: \n            if (x % k != 0 OR not (x//k in different))\n\n        This condition is true in two cases:\n            Case 1: x % k != 0 -> then we add x.\n            Case 2: x % k == 0 but the quotient (x//k) is not in the set -> then we add x.\n\n        Otherwise, we skip.\n\n   Why is the set storing the original x? And the condition is checking the quotient? \n\n   The idea: if there is a number that is k times a number already in the set, then we avoid adding the multiple? \n\n   But note: the array is sorted. So when we see a smaller number first? \n\n   Example: [2,4] and k=2: \n        sorted: [2,4]\n        for 2: 2%2==0 -> check if 2//2=1 is in the set? Initially, set is empty -> so condition: true -> add 2.\n        for 4: 4%2==0 -> check if 4//2=2 is in the set? yes -> condition false -> skip.\n\n        Then the set has only {2}. The output is 1.\n\n   But what if [4,2]? \n        sorted: [2,4] -> same.\n\n   What if [1,2,4]? \n        sorted: [1,2,4]\n        1: 1%2 !=0 -> add 1 -> set {1}\n        2: 2%2==0 -> check 1? (2//2=1) -> 1 is in the set -> skip.\n        4: 4%2==0 -> check 2? (4//2=2) -> but 2 is not in the set? because we skipped 2? -> so we add 4? \n        Then set has {1,4} -> output 2.\n\n   But is 4 avoidable? Because 4 = 2*2, and 2 is not in the set? \n\n   The algorithm is designed to avoid a number if it is k times a number that we have already added? But note: we skipped 2 because 1 was present. But 2 is not present? \n\n   However, the condition for 4: the quotient is 2, which was skipped -> so we add 4.\n\n   This algorithm is from a problem? It is meant to compute the size of a set that avoids including both a number and its multiple (if the multiple is present and the number is already chosen?).\n\n   But note: we are adding a number if either it is not divisible by k, or if it is divisible by k but the quotient (x/k) is not in the set.\n\n   We must replicate this in C.\n\n   Steps for the first program in C:\n\n        Step 1: Read num and k.\n        Step 2: Read an array of num integers.\n\n        Step 3: Sort the array.\n\n        Step 4: We'll use a set (or a data structure) to represent `different`. We can use a hash set? But the numbers can be large? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Alternatively, note that the array is sorted. We can use an array to mark if an element is in the set? But the set is built as we traverse.\n\n        But note: the condition checks for the quotient (which is an integer) in the set. The quotient might not be in the original array? Actually, it is the quotient of an element in the array. But the array might not contain the quotient? \n\n        However, we can use a dynamic set. Since the array is sorted and we traverse in increasing order, we can use a balanced BST or a hash set. In C, we can use a hash set (like a hash table) or a balanced tree (but we don't have one in standard). Alternatively, we can use an array of booleans for the indices? Not directly.\n\n        We need a set that supports:\n            - Insertion\n            - Lookup\n\n        We can use a dynamic array and linear search? But that would be O(n) per operation -> O(n^2). The array size? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a binary search tree? We can use a sorted array and then binary search? But insertion in sorted array is O(n). \n\n        We can use a hash set. We can implement a simple hash set with open addressing or chaining. But note: the numbers can be negative and large.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We don't know the constraints. We assume that the array length (num) is not huge? But we must design for correctness.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a balanced BST from the C standard? There is no standard one. But we can use an array and sort and then use binary search? But the set is built as we traverse. We can use a dynamic array and then sort for each insertion? That would be O(n^2 log n). \n\n        Another idea: we can use a binary search tree by hand? That's complicated.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a third-party library? But we are not allowed.\n\n        We can use a simple array and mark the presence? But the numbers might be very large.\n\n        But note: we are traversing the sorted array. The condition only checks for the quotient (x//k) in the set. The quotient might be any integer? \n\n        However, the quotient is at most the maximum element in the array divided by k? And the set only contains numbers from the array? Actually, no: the set contains numbers that we have added (which are from the array). And we are traversing the array in sorted order. So the quotient we are checking is one that we might have added? \n\n        Therefore, we can use a hash set. We'll implement a simple hash set for integers.\n\n        We'll choose a hash table with chaining. We'll use a fixed size? But we don't know the maximum size. Alternatively, we can use a dynamic array of linked lists? \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify constraints. We'll assume the array length is at most 10000? Then we can use a fixed size hash table.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a sorted array and binary search for each lookup? And then insertion would be O(n) per insertion -> O(n^2). For n=10000, that is 100e6 operations which might be acceptable in C? \n\n        Or we can use a balanced BST from the standard template? In C, we don't have one. We can use the `bsearch` and `qsort` but for dynamic set we need to insert and then sort? That would be O(n log n) per insertion? Not acceptable.\n\n        We'll use a hash set.\n\n        Steps for the hash set:\n\n            We'll choose a prime number for the table size, say 10007 (or larger if needed).\n\n            We'll create an array of linked lists (or we can use open addressing?).\n\n        However, to keep it simple, we'll use open addressing with linear probing? Or we can use separate chaining.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the C++ standard? But the problem asks for C.\n\n        We'll do separate chaining. We'll define:\n\n            struct node {\n                long long key;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            struct node* table[TABLE_SIZE] = {NULL};\n\n        But note: the numbers can be negative. We can take absolute value? But then modulo. We can use:\n\n            index = (key % TABLE_SIZE + TABLE_SIZE) % TABLE_SIZE;\n\n        However, we can define a hash function that maps any integer to a nonnegative index.\n\n        But note: the numbers might be very large? We can use modulo arithmetic.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a simpler approach: since the array length is num, the set will have at most num elements. We can use an array of linked lists of size (say) 2*num? But we don't know the maximum num.\n\n        We'll choose a fixed table size, say 10007. Then if num is bigger than 10007, we have collisions.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            #define TABLE_SIZE 10007\n\n            struct node {\n                long long val;\n                struct node *next;\n            };\n\n            struct node *set[TABLE_SIZE] = {NULL};\n\n        Then we write functions:\n            void insert(long long x)\n            int contains(long long x)\n\n        But note: the set in the first program is storing the original x (which are the array elements). The array elements are integers, but we read them as integers. However, the condition checks for the quotient (x//k). The quotient might be an integer that is not in the set? So we don't need to store the quotient? We are storing the original array elements.\n\n        Actually, the condition checks: if (x % k != 0 OR not (x//k in different))\n        Here, \"x//k in different\" means: is the integer value of the quotient present in the set? \n\n        So we need to store the original numbers. And we need to check for the quotient (which is an integer) in the set.\n\n        How to compute the quotient? We must mimic Python's integer division (floor division for negative). \n\n        We can write a function:\n\n            long long floor_div(long long x, long long k) {\n                if (k == 0) {\n                    // avoid division by zero, but k>=1 per input.\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                if (x >= 0) {\n                    return x / k;\n                } else {\n                    // Adjust for negative: we want floor division (round towards -infty)\n                    // Example: -5 / 2 should be -3 (in Python) but in C it is -2 (truncated).\n                    // Formula: (x - k + 1) / k; \n                    // But note: if x is divisible by k, then we want x/k? \n                    // Actually, we can use: \n                    //   if (x % k == 0) then we can use x/k? \n                    //   but in C, for negative x, modulus can be negative? We want to avoid.\n                    // We can do:\n                    return (x - (k - 1)) / k;\n                    // But let me test: \n                    //   x=-5, k=2: (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6/2 = -3 -> correct.\n                    //   x=-4, k=2: (-4 - 1) / 2 = -5/2 = -2? but in Python: -4//2 = -2 -> correct? \n                    //   Actually, in Python: \n                    //        -4//2 = -2, and -5//2 = -3.\n                    //   So our formula for negative: \n                    //        We want: \n                    //           x = -4: (x - (k-1)) / k = (-4 -1)/2 = -5/2 = -2 (if integer truncation) -> but in C, integer division truncates toward zero? \n                    //        But note: -5/2 in C is -2? because -5/2 is -2.5 -> truncated to -2? \n                    //   Actually, we want -5/2 to be -3? \n                    //   The formula (x - (k-1)) / k doesn't work for -4: we get -5/2 = -2.5 -> truncated to -2? which is what we want for -4//2? \n                    //   But for -5: we get -6/2=-3 -> correct.\n                    //   However, for x=-6, k=2: (-6-1)/2 = -7/2 = -3.5 -> truncated to -3? but in Python: -6//2 = -3 -> correct.\n                    //   But wait: what if k is negative? The problem says k is positive (from input: k>=1). So we don't need to handle negative k.\n\n                    // Therefore, we can use:\n                    return (x - (k - 1)) / k;\n                }\n            }\n\n        However, let me test in C: \n            For x=-5, k=2: (-5 - (2-1)) = -5-1 = -6 -> then -6/2 = -3 -> correct.\n            For x=-4, k=2: (-4-1) = -5 -> -5/2 = -2? because -5/2 in integer division is -2? \n                But we want -4//2 to be -2? -> correct.\n\n        Actually, we want floor division: the largest integer less than or equal to the real quotient.\n\n        For negative numbers that are divisible by k: \n            Example: x=-4, k=2: real quotient is -2 -> so floor division is -2 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the formula: \n            if (x >= 0) \n                quotient = x / k;\n            else\n                quotient = (x - (k-1)) / k;\n\n        But note: in C, for negative numbers, the division truncates toward zero. So the formula above for negative numbers does an adjustment by subtracting (k-1) and then truncates? \n\n        Actually, we are doing integer division: (x - (k-1)) / k is the same as: \n            (x - (k-1)) divided by k, with truncation toward zero? \n\n        But we want: floor(x/k) = (x - (k-1)) / k when x is negative? \n\n        It works for the examples. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (x % k == 0) {\n                quotient = x / k;\n            } else {\n                // if x is negative and not divisible, then we adjust.\n                quotient = x / k - (x < 0 ? 1 : 0);\n            }\n\n        But that might be more complicated.\n\n        We'll use the first method.\n\n   Step 5: Traverse the sorted array and for each element x:\n\n        long long q = floor_div(x, k);\n        if (x % k != 0 || !contains(q)) {\n            insert_set(x);\n            // update temp: the current set size? But note the set size is increasing? \n            // Actually, we are storing the maximum set size during the traversal? \n            // But the original code: \n            //     different.add(x)\n            //     temp = max(len(different), temp)\n            // So we need to keep a count of the current set size? \n            // We can maintain a variable `set_size` and update when we insert.\n        }\n\n        And then update: \n            current_set_size = ... we can maintain a variable `set_size` that we increment when we insert.\n            temp = (set_size > temp) ? set_size : temp;\n\n        But note: the original code does:\n            different.add(x)   -> but if x is already in the set? Actually, the set is a set, so duplicates are ignored. But the array might have duplicates? \n\n        The condition: \n            if (x % k != 0 || !contains(q))\n\n        But if x is already in the set? Then we don't need to add again? But the set ignores duplicates. However, the array is sorted? So duplicates would be consecutive? \n\n        How does the original program handle duplicates? \n            Example: [1,1] and k=1:\n                sorted: [1,1]\n                for first 1: \n                    1%1==0 -> check if 1//1=1 is in the set? no -> add 1 -> set becomes {1}, set_size=1, temp=1.\n                for second 1:\n                    1%1==0 -> check if 1 is in the set? yes -> skip.\n                output=1.\n\n        So we don't add duplicates. Therefore, we must check: if x is already in the set? Actually, the condition does not check for x in the set? It checks for the quotient. \n\n        But if x is duplicate, then the set already has x? Then we would skip? \n\n        However, the condition does not check for x, it checks for the quotient. \n\n        Example: duplicate and not divisible? \n            [2,2] and k=3: \n                sorted: [2,2]\n                first 2: 2%3 !=0 -> add -> set {2}, set_size=1, temp=1.\n                second 2: 2%3 !=0 -> condition true -> but the set already has 2? Then we don't add? \n                But the set in Python: \n                    set.add(2) -> then set still has one element.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid inserting duplicates. We can check: if x is already in the set? Then skip the insertion? \n\n        But the condition: \n            if (x % k !=0 || !contains(q)) \n            then we do: set.add(x) -> which does nothing if x is already present.\n\n        So we can do: \n            if (x % k !=0 || !contains(q)) {\n                // Then we want to add x only if it is not already present? \n                // But the set in Python does that.\n\n            }\n\n        We can design our set to be a set (no duplicates). Therefore, in our insert_set function, we can check if x is already in the set? Then skip. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n            if (!contains(x)) {\n                then insert(x);\n                set_size++;\n            }\n\n        But note: the condition might be true even if x is already in the set? Then we try to insert again? \n\n        Actually, the condition: \n            if (x % k !=0 || !contains(q))\n\n        This condition might be true for a duplicate? \n            Example: duplicate 2, k=3: condition true because 2%3!=0 -> then we try to insert 2 again -> which we skip.\n\n        So we can design the insert_set function to avoid duplicates.\n\n        Alternatively, we can not check and just insert (and the set will avoid duplicates) and then update the set_size only when we actually add? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if (x % k !=0 || !contains(q)) {\n                if (!contains(x)) { \n                    insert_set(x);\n                    set_size++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But wait: the original set does not care: it adds x again, but it remains the same set. Then the set size remains the same. But then we do:\n            temp = max(len(set), temp) -> so if we add a duplicate, the set size doesn't change.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply insert and then update the set_size to the current set size (by computing the size of the set? That would be inefficient). \n\n        Alternatively, we can maintain set_size as the current number of distinct elements. And we only increment when we add a new element.\n\n        We'll change the insert_set function to return 1 if we actually add, 0 otherwise.\n\n        However, to match the original, we can do:\n\n            if (x % k !=0 || !contains(q)) {\n                if (insert_set(x)) {   // returns 1 if new, 0 if duplicate\n                    set_size++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then update temp = (set_size > temp) ? set_size : temp;\n\n   Step 6: After processing the array, we have an integer `temp` (the maximum set_size during the traversal? Actually, note: the original code does:\n\n        for x in arr:\n            if ...:\n                different.add(x)\n            temp = max(len(different), temp)\n\n        So temp is the maximum size of the set at any point during the traversal.\n\n        But note: the set is growing and never shrinking. So the maximum is the final set_size? \n\n        Actually, we update after each x: so if we add an element, the set size increases. But if we skip, the set size remains. And we take the max.\n\n        However, the set only grows. So the maximum set size is the final set size? \n\n        But wait: what if we skip an element, then the set size doesn't change? But the max could be achieved in the middle? \n\n        Example: [1,2,4] and k=2: \n            sorted: [1,2,4]\n            x=1: condition -> 1%2 !=0 -> add 1 -> set_size=1 -> temp=1.\n            x=2: condition -> divisible? yes -> check 1 (2//2=1) -> 1 is present -> skip -> set_size remains 1 -> temp = max(1,1)=1.\n            x=4: condition -> divisible? yes -> check 2 (4//2=2) -> 2 is not present? -> add 4 -> set_size=2 -> temp = max(2,1)=2.\n\n        So the maximum is 2.\n\n        Therefore, we must update temp at every iteration (even if we skip) because the set size might have been larger in the past? Actually, the set only grows. So the current set_size is always increasing? \n\n        But note: the set size never decreases. So the maximum is the last value? \n\n        Actually, we do:\n\n            temp = max(len(different), temp)\n\n        at every step. So we must compute the set size at every step? \n\n        We can avoid by maintaining `set_size` and then:\n\n            if (inserted) {\n                set_size++;\n            }\n            if (set_size > temp) temp = set_size;\n\n        But note: the set might be the same as before? Then we don't update? \n\n        Actually, we update at every step: \n            temp = max(len(different), temp)\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            current_size = set_size;   // after possibly inserting\n            if (current_size > temp) temp = current_size;\n\n        But note: if we skip insertion, then set_size remains the same. Then we compare the same set_size as the previous step? \n\n        We can update:\n\n            if (inserted) {\n                set_size++;\n                if (set_size > temp) temp = set_size;\n            } else {\n                if (set_size > temp) temp = set_size;   // but set_size didn't change? then it's the same as before? \n            }\n\n        Actually, we can update at every step:\n\n            if (set_size > temp) temp = set_size;\n\n        But we can do: \n            temp = (set_size > temp) ? set_size : temp;\n\n        at the end of the loop.\n\n        This is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n   Step 7: Now we have the integer `temp` from the first program.\n\n   Step 8: Convert `temp` to a string. We must consider: \n        - If temp is 0, then string \"0\".\n        - If temp is negative? The problem: the array elements are integers, but the set size is nonnegative.\n\n        We can use `sprintf` to convert to a string.\n\n        Example: \n            char str[20];   // 64-bit integer: max 20 digits?\n            sprintf(str, \"%lld\", temp);   // we used long long? \n\n        But note: we used long long for the set and for the quotient? But the array elements are read as integers? The problem says integers. We can use `int` if the problem constraints are small? But the set size (temp) is at most the array length, which is `num`. And num is an integer. So we can use `int` for temp? \n\n        However, the array elements might be large? But the set size is the count of distinct numbers we added. That count is at most the array length (num). And num is an integer. So temp is an integer.\n\n        But note: we read num as an integer. So we can use `int` for the entire program? \n\n        However, the array elements might be as large as 10^9? But the set operations are on the values. We used long long for the set to avoid overflow? \n\n        Actually, the quotient: x//k. If x is -10^18 and k=1, then quotient is -10^18 -> we need long long? \n\n        Therefore, we must use long long for the array elements and for the set.\n\n        But the input: \n            first integer: num (number of elements) -> we can use int for num? \n            k -> int? \n\n        But the array elements: we read as long long? \n\n        So we'll use:\n\n            long long *arr = (long long*)malloc(num * sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then the set stores long long.\n\n        Then temp (the set size) is at most num, which is an int. So we can store temp as an int? \n\n        But note: the set size is the number of distinct numbers we added. It is an integer, and at most num (which is int). So we can use int for temp.\n\n        Then when converting to string: we can use:\n\n            char str[20];\n            sprintf(str, \"%d\", temp);   // if temp is int.\n\n        But wait: we used long long for the array and the set, but the set size (the count) is an int.\n\n        So we'll use:\n\n            int num, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &num, &k);\n            long long *arr = (long long*)malloc(num * sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then read the next line: num integers? But they are long long? \n\n            for (int i=0; i<num; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n        Then we sort: we can use qsort? \n\n            qsort(arr, num, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long va = *(long long*)a;\n                long long vb = *(long long*)b;\n                if (va < vb) return -1;\n                if (va > vb) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n   Step 9: Now we have a string `str` (which is the output of the first program) and we use it as the input for the second program.\n\n        The second program: \n            It expects a string S (which is the entire input for the second program). \n\n            Steps:\n                Count the frequency of each character in S.\n                Extract the distinct characters -> set Sa.\n                If the size of Sa is not 2 -> print \"No\".\n                Else, for each character in Sa, check if the frequency is 2 -> if any is not 2, print \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the string S is the string representation of the integer temp. \n\n        Example: \n            temp=12 -> S=\"12\": \n                distinct: {'1','2'} -> size=2 -> then frequency of '1' is 1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\".\n\n        We must do:\n\n            int freq[256] = {0};   // for ASCII characters?\n            int len = strlen(str);\n            for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                freq[(unsigned char)str[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            // Count distinct non-zero frequency characters? \n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) distinct_count++;\n            }\n\n            if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (valid) {\n                    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"No\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n\n        However, note: the second program does:\n\n            Sa = set(list(S))\n            if len(Sa) != 2: \n                print \"No\"\n            else:\n                for i in Sa:\n                    if c[i] != 2:\n                        print \"No\"\n                        exit()\n                print \"Yes\"\n\n        So it doesn't require that every character that appears must appear twice? It requires that each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        printf(\"No\\n\");\n                        return 0;   // but note: we are in the main function? \n                    }\n                }\n                printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n            }\n\n        But note: the distinct_count is 2, so we iterate over the two characters? We break at the first that is not 2? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break early.\n\n        However, we can also note: the string might have more than two characters? \n\n        Example: temp=1122 -> string \"1122\": distinct_count=2? \n            distinct characters: '1' and '2'. \n            frequency of '1': 2, frequency of '2':2 -> valid.\n\n        But the string \"1112\": \n            distinct characters: '1' and '2' -> distinct_count=2.\n            frequency of '1':3 -> not 2 -> we print \"No\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Step 10: We must free allocated memory? \n\n        We allocated the array and the set nodes? \n\n        We can free the set nodes? But the program ends. \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid freeing for simplicity.\n\n   Summary of the entire C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        #define TABLE_SIZE 10007\n\n        // For the set (for the first program) we define a linked list node.\n        struct node {\n            long long val;\n            struct node *next;\n        };\n\n        struct node *set[TABLE_SIZE] = {NULL};   // global? or we can make it local and initialize to NULL.\n\n        // Hash function: \n        unsigned int hash(long long x) {\n            unsigned int value = (unsigned int)(x % TABLE_SIZE);\n            return value % TABLE_SIZE;\n        }\n\n        // Insert into the set: returns 1 if inserted (i.e., it was not present), 0 if duplicate.\n        int insert_set(long long x) {\n            unsigned int idx = hash(x);\n            struct node *p = set[idx];\n            while (p != NULL) {\n                if (p->val == x) {\n                    return 0;   // already present\n                }\n                p = p->next;\n            }\n            // not found -> insert at head\n            struct node *new_node = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));\n            new_node->val = x;\n            new_node->next = set[idx];\n            set[idx] = new_node;\n            return 1;\n        }\n\n        int contains(long long x) {\n            unsigned int idx = hash(x);\n            struct node *p = set[idx];\n            while (p != NULL) {\n                if (p->val == x) {\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                p = p->next;\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // Function to free the set?

In our C code, we adjusted the modulus to be nonnegative? \n\n        In Python: \n            x % k is nonnegative? \n            So we adjust: if the modulus is negative, we add k to get in the range [0, k-1].\n\n        Then we compare: mod != 0.\n\n        This matches the Python condition.\n\n   Let me test with negative x and positive k: \n        x = -3, k=2: \n            In C: \n                mod = (-3) % 2 -> in C: this is -1? \n                then we adjust: mod = -1 + 2 = 1 -> then condition: 1 != 0 -> true.\n\n        In Python: \n            -3 % 2 -> 1 -> condition true.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   However, note: the condition in the first program is:\n\n        if (x % k != 0 or not x // k in different)\n\n        We have to do:\n\n            if (mod != 0 || !contains(q))\n\n        This condition uses logical OR. If the first condition is true, we skip the second? In C, logical OR is short-circuited. \n\n        So if mod !=0, we skip the contains check -> which is the same as Python.\n\n   Therefore, the program should be correct.\n\n   But note: the set in the first program is built as we traverse. We do the same.\n\n   However, note: the original Python program does:\n\n        different = set()\n        temp = 0\n        arr.sort()\n        for x in arr:\n            if (x % k != 0 or not x // k in different):\n                different.add(x)\n            temp = max(len(different), temp)\n\n        We do:\n\n            for each x in sorted arr:\n                condition -> if true, then insert_set(x) (if not present) and update set_size if inserted.\n                then update temp = max(set_size, temp)\n\n        This matches.\n\n   One more note: the condition in the first program:\n\n        if (x % k != 0 or not x // k in different)\n\n        In Python, the `or` is short-circuited. We do the same in C.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above C program.\n\n   However, note: the array might be empty? Then num=0 -> we read nothing? \n\n   We'll assume the input is as described.\n\n   We'll write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: We assumed the set size for the hash table is 10007. If the array has more than 10007 distinct numbers, we may have collisions? But the set still works (chaining). It just might be slower.\n\n   We are not given constraints, but 10007 is a prime and should be enough for moderate inputs.\n\n   If we need more, we can increase.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a larger table.\n\n   But the problem does not specify.\n\n   We'll go with 10007.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must include necessary headers.\n\n   We'll include: <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>\n\n   And we'll use:\n\n        struct node for the linked list.\n\n   We'll define the hash function and the set operations.\n\n   We'll compile with C99.\n\n   One more note: the modulus adjustment for negative: we do mod = x % k; then if (mod < 0) mod += k; \n        This is safe? Because the modulus in C for x negative might be negative? \n\n        Example: x=-5, k=2: \n            -5 % 2: in C, it can be -1? \n            then mod becomes 1 -> matches Python.\n\n   We do this adjustment for the condition.\n\n   But note: the floor_div function uses a different method? We don't use the modulus for the floor_div, we use the formula.\n\n   And the condition for the set: we use the quotient from floor_div.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Let me write the complete C program."
