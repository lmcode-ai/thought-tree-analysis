Then the second program (File 2) reads input (which now would be the output of the first program) and computes a final result.\n\nHowever, note the instruction: \n  - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n  - Only the last block should produce output.\n\nSo in our C program:\n  - We will read the initial input (for the first program) from stdin.\n  - The first program's logic will run and produce a value (which in the original chain is printed and then read by the second program as input).\n  - But note: the second program expects a string input (S) that is the entire line. However, the first program prints an integer (distance). So the input to the second program is a string representation of that integer.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string that might contain digits and '?'. However, in the chain, the output of the first program is an integer. So the second program would read a string of digits (with no '?').\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program gets the string of the integer that the first program printed.\n\nBut the second program's code also has an exit condition for when the string length is 1. So we must consider that the output of the first program (an integer) might be a single digit or multiple digits.\n\nBut note: the first program prints an integer without any formatting, so it could be one or more digits.\n\nHow to chain without I/O in the middle?\n  - We cannot actually print and then read in the middle. Instead, we will:\n        1. Read the initial input for the first program (four integers: v1, v2, t, d).\n        2. Run the first program's logic to compute `distance`.\n        3. Convert the integer `distance` to a string. This string will be the input for the second program.\n\nThen we run the second program's logic on that string.\n\nImportant: The second program uses modulo arithmetic and dynamic programming to count the number of ways to interpret the string (with possible '?') as a number modulo 13 that equals 5. However, in our chain, the string we get from the first program is a string of digits (no '?'). Therefore, we can note that the second program will have no '?' in the string. So the DP will only consider the fixed digits.\n\nBut note: the second program is written to handle a string that might contain '?'. In our case, the string we get is the string representation of the integer `distance`, which has no '?'. So we can simplify the second program's logic? Actually, we don't need to change the logic because the condition \"if S[i] != '?'\" will be true for every character. So we can run the same DP.\n\nHowever, the second program also has an exit condition for when the string length is 1. So we must handle that.\n\nSteps for the C program:\n\n1. Read the initial four integers (v1, v2, t, d). They are on two lines: \n      first line: v1 and v2\n      second line: t and d\n\n2. Run the first program's logic to compute `distance`.\n\n3. Convert the integer `distance` to a string. Let this string be `S`.\n\n4. Now run the second program's logic on the string `S`.\n\nBut note: the second program originally reads from stdin. Instead, we are going to use the string `S` that we just generated.\n\nAlso note: the second program uses modulo (10**9+7) and a DP table of size [n][13]. We must replicate that.\n\nHowever, note the constraints: \n   - In the first program, `t` is given. The loop runs `t` times. The value of `t` can be up to 100 (from the problem context? but we don't have constraints). However, the second program's string is the string representation of `distance`. Since `distance` is the sum of up to `t` terms, each term being at most ...? The velocity can increase by up to `d` each step. So `distance` might be as large as about (v1 + ... ) which is O(t * max_velocity). Since t can be up to 100, the distance might be up to 100 * (v1 + ...) which is maybe 10000? So the string length is at most 5 or 6? But we must be safe: let's say up to 1000000? Then the string length is 7. Actually, worst-case: t=100, d=100, v1=0, then the velocity might go up to 100*100 = 10000, and the total distance would be the sum of an arithmetic series? Actually, the first program does not necessarily form an arithmetic series because it might reverse the acceleration. However, worst-case the distance might be O(t^2 * d). t up to 100, d up to 100 -> 100^2 * 100 = 1000000, which is 7 digits. So the string length is at most 7. \n\nBut the problem does not specify constraints. However, the second program sets recursion limit to 10^7, but we are not going to use recursion. We are going to use iterative DP. And the string length is small (max 7). So we can safely allocate a DP array of [7][13].\n\nSteps for the second program in C:\n\n   - We have a string `S` (the string representation of `distance`).\n   - Let n = length of S.\n   - If n==1, then we check: if the character is '5' then output 1, if it is not a digit? Actually, our string is digits only. So if it is '5', then output 1, else 0. But note: the original program also handles '?'. But we don't have '?'. So for n==1: \n          if S[0]=='5' -> output 1\n          else -> output 0\n   - Otherwise, we set up a dp array for 13 states (modulo 13) for each position.\n\nBut note: the original program does modulo 10**9+7.\n\nNow, the plan for the entire C program:\n\n  1. Read the initial two lines of integers (v1, v2, t, d).\n  2. Compute the first program's logic to get `distance`.\n  3. Convert `distance` to a string (using sprintf, and then we know the length).\n  4. Run the second program's logic on that string.\n\nWe must be cautious: the second program's logic uses modulo 10**9+7.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nStructure:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  #include <math.h>\n\n  #define MOD 1000000007\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read v1, v2, t, d\n      int v1, v2, t, d;\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &v1, &v2);\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &t, &d);\n\n      // Step 2: First program logic\n      int a = 1;\n      int v = v1;\n      long long distance = 0;   // because the distance might be large\n      for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {\n          // Condition: if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n          if (v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d) {\n              a = -1;\n              v = (t - i - 1) * d + v2;\n          }\n          distance += v;\n          v += a * d;\n      }\n\n      // Step 3: Convert distance to string\n      char S[20]; // 20 is enough for 64-bit integer (max 20 digits)\n      sprintf(S, \"%lld\", distance);\n      int n = strlen(S);\n\n      // Step 4: Second program logic\n      // If the string length is 1\n      if (n == 1) {\n          if (S[0] == '5') {\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"0\\n\");\n          }\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n      // We'll create a dp array: dp[13] for the current row and next row?\n      // Actually, we can do iterative: dp[j] for j in 0..12 for the current position.\n      long long dp[13] = {0}; // for the current row\n      long long next_dp[13];  // for the next row\n\n      // Initialize for the first character\n      if (S[0] != '?') {\n          int digit = S[0] - '0';\n          dp[digit] = 1;\n      } else {\n          for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n              dp[j] = 1;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // For each subsequent character\n      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n          // Clear next_dp\n          for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n              next_dp[k] = 0;\n          }\n\n          if (S[i] != '?') {\n              int digit = S[i] - '0';\n              for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n                  int new_rem = (k * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                  next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n              }\n          } else {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n                      int new_rem = (k * 10 + j) % 13;\n                      next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Copy next_dp to dp for the next iteration\n          for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n              dp[k] = next_dp[k];\n          }\n      }\n\n      // The result is dp[5]\n      printf(\"%lld\\n\", dp[5]);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: in the first program, the condition for reversing the acceleration might be triggered only once? Actually, the condition is inside the loop and the acceleration might flip multiple times? However, the problem is that we are using `a` as either 1 or -1. But when we set `a = -1` and then later we might have the condition again? Actually, let me analyze:\n\nThe condition is: if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n\nAfter flipping the acceleration, we set `v` to a value that is exactly (t-i-1)*d + v2. Then we add that to the distance and then update v by adding a*d (which is subtracting d). Then in the next iteration, we have:\n\n  v = (t-i-1)*d + v2 - d = (t-i-2)*d + v2\n\nSo then the condition becomes: \n  v - v2 = (t-i-2)*d \n  and (t - i - 1 - 1) * d = (t-i-2)*d -> so the condition is: (t-i-2)*d > (t-i-2)*d? -> no, so it doesn't trigger again.\n\nBut what if after flipping, the condition becomes true again? Actually, after flipping we set the velocity to a value that is exactly the maximum we can have without overshooting? So it should not trigger again. However, the condition might be triggered multiple times? Actually, the condition is only checked at the beginning of each iteration. And after flipping, we set `a` to -1 and set `v` to a safe value. Then the next time, the condition will be:\n\n  v = (t-i-1)*d + v2 - d = (t-i-2)*d + v2\n  Condition: v - v2 = (t-i-2)*d > (t - i - 1 - 1) * d = (t-i-2)*d -> no, equal? so not greater.\n\nSo it should not trigger again. But what if we have multiple flips? Actually, the problem is that we might be going too fast and then we have to brake, but then we might be going too slow? The problem doesn't say, but the condition is only for being too high? \n\nWait, the condition is: if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n\nThis condition checks if we are going too fast to be able to brake in the remaining time. If so, we brake (set a=-1) and set the current velocity to the maximum that we can have so that we can reduce to v2 in the remaining time.\n\nBut note: we might also be going too slow? The condition does not check for that. So we are only braking when we are too fast. Then the acceleration remains 1 until we become too fast? And then we brake and then we are safe until the end.\n\nTherefore, the condition should only trigger once. But what if we are already braking (a=-1) and then we become too slow? The condition doesn't check for that. Actually, the problem is symmetric? The original problem might be symmetric, but the code only handles the case of being too fast. \n\nHowever, the problem states: the output of the first program is the distance. We are going to replicate the same behavior. So we don't change the logic.\n\nBut note: the condition in the first program:\n\n    if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n\nBut if d is negative? Actually, the problem says d is given as input and we read it as integer. The problem does not specify constraints, but the original code uses multiplication by d and then subtracts. Also, the acceleration is multiplied by d. So if d is negative, then the condition might be reversed? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the sign of d. However, the original code does not handle negative d. We assume the input is nonnegative? The problem context: d is likely the maximum change in velocity per time step? and nonnegative.\n\nBut to be safe, we follow the Python code.\n\nIn the condition: we have (t-i-1)*d. Since t-i-1 is nonnegative, if d is negative then the condition would be: if v - v2 > (a negative number) then always true? But then we set a = -1 and then set v = ... which would be (t-i-1)*d + v2 -> which is negative? Then the next condition: v - v2 = (t-i-1)*d + v2 - v2 = (t-i-1)*d (negative) and then we compare with (t-i-2)*d (also negative) and then the condition becomes: negative1 > negative2? \n\nBut note: if d is negative, then (t-i-1)*d is negative and (t-i-2)*d is also negative and (t-i-1)*d is greater than (t-i-2)*d because (t-i-1) < (t-i-2) when multiplied by negative? Actually, no: (t-i-1) > (t-i-2) -> so (t-i-1)*d < (t-i-2)*d when d is negative.\n\nSo the condition is not symmetric. However, the problem does not specify the input constraints. We must assume the same as the Python code: the input d is nonnegative? The problem says \"d\" is given and the code uses it as an absolute value? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we do exactly the same. We assume the input d is nonnegative? Actually, the problem does not specify. We'll do the same as the Python code: without assuming.\n\nBut note: the condition in the first program:\n\n    if (v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d)\n\nIn C, if d is negative, then (t-i-1)*d is negative. And if v-v2 is positive, then the condition is true. Then we set a = -1 and set v = ... which is (t-i-1)*d + v2. Since d is negative, (t-i-1)*d is negative, so v becomes less than v2? Then the next condition: v - v2 is negative, and (t-i-2)*d is also negative? and then we compare: negative1 (v-v2) > negative2? \n\nFor example: \n   v-v2 = -10, (t-i-2)*d = -20 -> then -10 > -20 -> true? Then we set a = -1 again? But we are already braking? and then set v = (t-i-2)*d + v2 = -20 + v2 -> which is even lower? \n\nThis does not seem to be the intended behavior. But the problem does not specify. We are just translating.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nSo we must do the same. The Python code uses integers and the condition is an integer comparison. We'll do the same.\n\nBut note: the condition in the first program might be triggered multiple times? In the Python code, when we set `a = -1`, we don't reset it to 1 later. So if we are braking, we keep braking? But then the condition might trigger again? \n\nActually, the condition is:\n\n    if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n\nAfter we set a = -1 and set v to a specific value, then in the next iteration, we update v by: v += a * d -> so if a is -1, then v becomes v - d. Then we start the next iteration with that new v.\n\nAnd then we check the condition again: now v is even lower? and (t-i-1) is one less? \n\nBut if d is positive, then (t-i-1)*d is decreasing, and v is decreasing? so the condition (v - v2) is becoming more negative? and the right side is decreasing? so the condition (v - v2 > (t-i-1)*d) might become true again? \n\nWait: if we are braking and d is positive, then (t-i-1)*d is positive? and v - v2 is negative? so the condition (negative > positive) is false. So it won't trigger again.\n\nBut if d is negative? then the condition might be triggered again? \n\nWe must follow the Python code. The Python code does not reset `a` to 1. So once we set `a = -1`, it remains -1. Then in the condition, we might set `a = -1` again? but it's already -1. And then we set `v` again? That would overwrite the current velocity? \n\nSo the condition might be triggered multiple times? \n\nTherefore, we must not assume it only triggers once.\n\nBut note: the condition sets `a = -1` and then sets `v = (t-i-1)*d + v2`. Then in the next iteration, we subtract d (because a=-1 and d is negative? then subtracting a negative is adding). Actually: \n\n  v += a * d\n\nIf a is -1 and d is negative, then: v += (-1) * (negative) = positive -> so v increases? \n\nThis is getting complex. We'll just translate the condition and the update as in the Python code.\n\nSo the first program in C:\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {\n      if (v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d) {\n          a = -1;\n          v = (t - i - 1) * d + v2;\n      }\n      distance += v;\n      v += a * d;\n  }\n\nBut note: the condition uses the current v and then sets v to a new value. Then we add the new v to the distance? Actually, in the Python code, the condition is at the beginning of the loop. Then we add the current v (which might have been updated by the condition) to the distance. Then we update v for the next iteration.\n\nSo in C, we do the same.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious with integer overflow? The problem does not specify the bounds. We use `long long` for distance because the distance might be large. But for v, we use int? The problem says the inputs are integers. But the velocity might become large? \n\nBut the condition sets v to (t-i-1)*d + v2, which is at most (t-1)*d + v2. Since t and d are given as integers, and the original problem doesn't specify bounds, we use int for v? But the distance is long long.\n\nBut what if t is 100 and d is 10000? Then (t-1)*d is 99*10000 = 990000, which fits in int? (which is at least 32 bits, so up to 2e9). But worst-case: t=100, d=1000000 -> 99*1000000 = 99e6, which is 99 million, which fits in int (if int is 32-bit: up to 2e9). So we can use int for v.\n\nBut to be safe, we use long for v? The problem does not specify. However, the Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the inputs are read as integers and the operations are integer operations. We must avoid overflow.\n\nBut the problem says: same input, same behavior. If the input is such that the values exceed the range of int, then we must use long for v and the intermediate calculations.\n\nWe'll use long for v and a and the condition calculations? Actually, the condition: (t-i-1)*d might be large? We can use long for the condition.\n\nBut note: we are reading t and d as int. Then we assign to a long? \n\nWe'll change: \n\n  long v1, v2, t, d;\n  scanf(\"%ld %ld\", &v1, &v2);\n  scanf(\"%ld %ld\", &t, &d);\n\nBut wait: the first program's condition: (t-i-1)*d -> if t and d are large, then this might be very large? But the problem says the input is the same. We'll assume that the input values are such that we don't overflow? But to be safe, we use long for these variables.\n\nAlternatively, we can use long long for everything? Since the distance is long long and we are adding v (which might be large) to distance.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the bounds. We'll use long long for the variables that are used in the condition and for v and the arithmetic.\n\nSo:\n\n  long long v1, v2, t, d;\n  scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &v1, &v2);\n  scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &t, &d);\n\n  long long a = 1;\n  long long v = v1;\n  long long distance = 0;\n\nBut note: the condition: (t - i - 1) * d -> this might be negative? So we use signed.\n\nNow, the second program: the string conversion of distance. We use sprintf with \"%lld\", so we must use a buffer of sufficient size.\n\nNow, the second program's DP: we use modulo 10**9+7. We define MOD as 1000000007.\n\nBut note: the original second program has an exit for n==1. We do that.\n\nAlso, note: the original second program has:\n\n      if n == 1:\n          if S == '5' or S == '?': ... \n\nBut in our case, the string is only digits. So we only check for '5'. However, the original program also handles '?' but we don't have any. So we can write:\n\n      if (n == 1) {\n          if (S[0] == '5') {\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"0\\n\");\n          }\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nBut note: the original program does not return in the middle? Actually, it exits. So we return.\n\nBut the rest of the code after the n==1 check is for n>=2.\n\nNow, the DP for the second program: we use an array of 13 long long for the current state. We initialize for the first character. Then for each subsequent character, we update.\n\nBut note: the modulus in the DP: \n   new_rem = (k * 10 + j) % 13\n\nWe do modulo 13.\n\nWe must be cautious: the modulus operation in C: the % operator for negative numbers? But k is in 0..12, and j is 0..9, so k*10+j is nonnegative and less than 130, so modulo 13 is safe.\n\nBut the modulus of a negative? We don't have negatives.\n\nNow, the entire code:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  #define MOD 1000000007\n\n  int main() {\n      long long v1, v2, t, d;\n      scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &v1, &v2);\n      scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &t, &d);\n\n      long long a = 1;\n      long long v = v1;\n      long long distance = 0;\n      for (long long i = 0; i < t; i++) {\n          // Condition: if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d\n          // Note: if (t-i-1) is negative? then the condition might be different? \n          // But the problem does not specify, so we do the same as Python.\n          long long remaining = t - i - 1;\n          if (v - v2 > remaining * d) {\n              a = -1;\n              v = remaining * d + v2;\n          }\n          distance += v;\n          v += a * d;\n      }\n\n      // Convert distance to string\n      char S[25]; // enough for 20 digits\n      sprintf(S, \"%lld\", distance);\n      int n = strlen(S);\n\n      // Second program\n      if (n == 1) {\n          if (S[0] == '5') {\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"0\\n\");\n          }\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n      // DP array for 13 mod classes\n      long long dp[13] = {0};\n      // Initialize for the first character\n      if (S[0] == '?') {\n          for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n              dp[j] = 1;\n          }\n      } else {\n          int digit = S[0] - '0';\n          dp[digit] = 1;\n      }\n\n      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n          long long next_dp[13] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n\n          if (S[i] == '?') {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n                      int new_rem = (k * 10 + j) % 13;\n                      next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n                  }\n              }\n          } else {\n              int digit = S[i] - '0';\n              for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n                  int new_rem = (k * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                  next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % MOD;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Copy next_dp to dp\n          for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n              dp[k] = next_dp[k];\n          }\n      }\n\n      printf(\"%lld\\n\", dp[5]);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the condition in the first program: \n   if (v - v2 > remaining * d)\n\nThis condition might be true even when remaining is negative? Actually, if i >= t-1, then remaining = t-i-1 becomes negative? But the loop runs for i in [0, t-1]. So the last iteration: i = t-1, then remaining = t - (t-1) - 1 = 0. Then the condition: v - v2 > 0 * d -> v - v2 > 0? \n\nBut the condition is checked at the beginning of the iteration. Then we add the current v to distance and then update v for the next iteration? But the next iteration is the last? Actually, the loop runs exactly t times. So the last iteration: i = t-1, remaining=0. Then condition: v - v2 > 0? \n\nBut note: after updating v for the next iteration, we don't use that v? Actually, the last iteration: we update v at the end, but then we break the loop. So the updated v is not used? \n\nBut the condition in the last iteration: we use the current v (which is the velocity at time i) and then update v to v + a*d, but that updated v is not used in the next iteration? \n\nSo the condition in the last iteration: we set v to ... only if the condition is true? Then we add that v to the distance? and then update v (which is not used).\n\nSo the condition is safe.\n\nHowever, note: the condition might be triggered in the last iteration? and then we set v = 0*d + v2 = v2. Then we add that to the distance? Then update v to v2 + a*d? but that update is not used.\n\nBut what was the velocity for the last step? We set it to v2? That is the intended velocity? \n\nSo the condition in the last iteration sets the current velocity to v2? Then we add v2 to the distance? Then we update v to v2 + a*d? which is not used.\n\nBut without the condition, what would we have? We would have the current v (which might be v1 + a*d*(t-1) and then we add that to the distance? and then update v? \n\nBut the problem? The problem does not specify the exact algorithm. We are replicating the Python code.\n\nBut note: the condition in the last iteration: if the current v is greater than v2? then we set the current v to v2? Then we add v2 to the distance? \n\nThat makes sense: we want to end at v2? Actually, the problem doesn't say, but the condition is set to avoid overshooting. So in the last iteration, we set the current velocity to v2? \n\nBut the problem says: we have two velocities v1 and v2 and we want to maximize the distance? But the condition is set to avoid overshooting? \n\nAnyway, we do the same as the Python code.\n\nNow, one more thing: the first program in Python might have an off-by-one? The loop runs t times. The problem says: for t steps? \n\nWe'll run the same number of steps.\n\nBut note: the Python code does:\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\nSo i from 0 to t-1, inclusive.\n\nIn C, we do:\n\n    for (long long i = 0; i < t; i++)\n\nSame.\n\nNow, we output the result of the second program: dp[5] modulo MOD.\n\nBut note: the second program in Python does:\n\n        dp[i][k] %= mod   after processing each row.\n\nWe do modulo at every addition.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nLet me test with a small input for the first program? For example:\n\nInput: \n  1 1\n  1 1\n\nThen t=1, so the loop runs once.\n  v = v1 = 1\n  Condition: i=0, remaining = t-0-1 = 0 -> v - v2 = 1-1=0, and 0*d=0 -> condition false.\n  Then distance += 1 -> distance=1.\n  Then update v: v = 1 + 1*1 = 2.\n\nThen the string S = \"1\", so the second program: n=1 -> then if S[0]=='1'? -> output 0.\n\nBut the expected? The first program outputs 1, then the second program reads \"1\" and outputs 0.\n\nNow, what if input:\n  1 1\n  2 1\n\nFirst program:\n  i=0: \n      remaining = 2-0-1 = 1\n      condition: v=1 -> 1-1=0 > 1*1? -> 0>1? false.\n      distance = 1\n      update: v = 1+1=2\n  i=1:\n      remaining = 2-1-1=0\n      condition: 2-1=1 > 0 -> true -> set a=-1, v = 0*1+1 = 1\n      distance = 1+1 = 2\n      update: v = 1 + (-1)*1 = 0\n\nThen output 2 -> second program: string \"2\", n=1 -> output 0.\n\nBut the problem? We are just translating.\n\nNow, we'll write the entire code.\n\nBut note: the condition might be triggered and then we set v to a value, and then we add that value to the distance? Then we update v by adding a*d? \n\nIn the example above: in the second iteration, we set v=1, then we add 1 to the distance, then update v to 0.\n\nBut the condition at the next iteration? There is none because we break after two iterations.\n\nSo the code.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nOne more issue: the condition might be triggered multiple times? For example, if d is negative? Then the condition might be triggered in multiple iterations? And we set a=-1 each time? That's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the condition sets v to a new value. Then we add that new value to the distance? Then update v by adding a*d? \n\nYes.\n\nSo the final C code:"
