Read a list of `2*n` floating-point numbers (since the next line reads a line and splits it, and then we have `o = 2*n - len(arr)` and the condition that we take non-integer parts only for non-integer numbers).\n  3. For each number, if the fractional part is non-zero, we take it. Then we sort the list of fractional parts.\n  4. `o` is the count of integers (numbers that have fractional part 0) and also note that we started with `2*n` numbers? Actually, the input has `2*n` numbers? The problem says: the input to the first program is the output of the previous? But the first program reads `n` and then a list of numbers. The problem states that the output of each program is the input to the next.\n\n However, note: the second program reads a string. So the output of the first program is a string (with \"%.3f\") and that becomes the input to the second program.\n\n But wait: the problem says the entire sequence is executed in sequence. So the first program reads from stdin and writes to stdout, then the second reads from stdout of the first and writes to stdout.\n\n However, the instructions say: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we must:\n\n  - Read the input for the first program (which is an integer `n` and then a list of `2*n` floats? Actually, note: the first program does `arr = list(map(float, input().split()))`. The input after `n` is one line of numbers. How many? It doesn't specify, but note: the variable `o` is defined as `2 * n - len(arr)`. And `arr` initially is the list of numbers we read. Then we filter out the integer numbers (fractional part 0). So the total numbers we read is `2*n`? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but note the variable `o` is defined as `2*n - len(arr)`, and `arr` is the initial list. So we must have exactly `2*n` numbers? Because the problem says: the input to the first program is the initial input.\n\n  But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and the second program takes the output of the first. The first program outputs a string of the form \"x.xxx\" (a floating point number with three decimal places). Then the second program takes that string.\n\n How do we combine?\n\n  We have two separate programs. The first program takes:\n      Input: \n          first integer n\n          then a line of 2*n floats\n\n  The second program takes a string (which is the output of the first program) and processes it.\n\n  However, the second program in the chain gets the output of the first as its input. So the input to the second program is a string of the form \"x.xxx\".\n\n  Therefore, the entire input to the combined program is:\n      - The integer n and the 2*n floats (for the first program)\n      - Then the second program will take the result of the first program (which is a string) and process it.\n\n  But note: the second program's input is the output of the first. In the combined program, we don't output the intermediate result. We only output the final result.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. We read the input for the first program: an integer `n` and then a list of `2*n` floats.\n\n  2. We run the first program's logic without printing the intermediate result. Instead, we store the result (the string \"%.3f\") in a buffer that will be used as input for the second program.\n\n  3. Then we run the second program on that buffer (which is a string) and then output the result of the second program.\n\n  However, note: the second program expects to read a string from stdin. But in the combined program, we are not going to read from stdin again for the second program. Instead, we will simulate the input to the second program as the output of the first.\n\n  Therefore, we must:\n\n    - For the first program, we compute the floating point result and format it as a string (with three decimal places). This string will be the input for the second program.\n\n    - Then we run the second program on that string.\n\n  But note: the second program is designed to process a string that has punctuation and spaces. Specifically, it removes extra spaces and adjusts punctuation.\n\n  However, the output of the first program is a string that is a floating point number with three decimal places. It will look like: \"x.xxx\" (with no spaces). So when we pass that to the second program, what does the second program do?\n\n  Let's see the second program:\n\n    s = input()   # This is the string from the first program, e.g., \"1.234\"\n\n    Then it processes the string:\n\n      punctuation = [',', '.', '!', '?']\n\n      It goes through each character and:\n\n        - If the current character is a space (note: in the code it's written as `''` but that is an empty string? That must be a typo. It should be `' '` (space). Because in the code:\n\n          if s[i] == '':   -> this is checking for empty string? That doesn't make sense. Also, in the next line: `res[-1] != ''` -> again, checking for empty string.\n\n        Actually, the original code has a bug: it uses `''` (empty string) instead of `' '` (space). But in the problem, the second program is given as:\n\n          if s[i] == '':\n\n        That condition is never true because a string in Python is composed of characters, and a character cannot be an empty string. So I suspect it's a typo and it should be a space.\n\n        Let me re-read the code:\n\n          punctuation = [',', '.', '!', '?']\n\n          for i in range(len(s)):\n            if i>=1:\n              if s[i] == '':   -> here, it should be space? Because then it says: if res[-1] is not space, then append the space? Otherwise skip.\n\n        The code is trying to remove consecutive spaces and also to remove space before punctuation? And to add space after punctuation? Actually, the code does:\n\n          - If current character is space:\n              if the last character in res is not space, then add the space; else skip.\n\n          - Else (if not space):\n              if the current character is in punctuation:\n                  if the last character in res is a space, then remove that space (pop) and then append the punctuation and then a space? \n                  Actually: \n                      res.append(s[i])   -> the punctuation\n                      res.append('')   -> but again, this is an empty string? That doesn't make sense.\n\n        There are multiple typos in the second program.\n\n        Let me correct the second program:\n\n          The code uses `''` (empty string) in multiple places. This is likely a mistake. It should be `' '` (space).\n\n        Also, the line: `res.append('')` is probably meant to append a space? So we should replace `''` by `' '` everywhere.\n\n        Given the instructions, we are to reproduce the behavior. So we have to assume that the second program is as written, but we must fix the typos? Or we must run it as is?\n\n        However, in the original Python code, the condition `s[i] == ''` is always false because a character in a string is a string of length 1 (or in the case of an empty string, the loop wouldn't run). So the program might not do what was intended.\n\n        But note: the input to the second program is a string that does not contain any space? It's a floating point number. So the second program will:\n\n          - For each character in the string (which is, for example, \"1.234\"):\n\n            i=0: \n              first character: '1'\n              since i==0, we go to the else part:\n                if s[0]==' ' -> skip? no, because it's '1'\n                if s[0] in punctuation -> no, so we append '1'\n\n            i=1: \n              character '.' -> in punctuation? yes, so in the else part: \n                we check: if res[-1] is space? Currently, res = ['1'] -> last is '1', not space. Then we do:\n                  res.append('.') and then res.append('') -> but appending an empty string? Then we get ['1', '.', ''].\n\n            i=2: character '2' -> not space, not punctuation? Actually, '.' is punctuation, but '2' is not. So we append '2'\n\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Then we join: so for \"1.234\" we get: \"1. 234\" ? Because after the '.' we appended an empty string? Then we get \"1\" + \".\" + \"\" + \"2\" + \"3\" + \"4\" -> \"1.234\"\n\n        But wait: the empty string doesn't show. So the output would be \"1.234\", same as input.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So if the second program doesn't change the string, then the output is the same as the first program's output.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs a string with three decimal places. The second program then outputs the same string? Then the combined program should output the same as the first program? But the problem says: the last block should handle producing output.\n\n        However, the second program is intended to remove extra spaces and fix punctuation. But in this case, the input has no spaces and the punctuation (the decimal point) is handled by appending an empty string? That doesn't change the string.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain would output the same as the first program? But then why include the second program?\n\n        But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must do exactly as the chain.\n\n        Alternatively, the second program might be intended for a different input? But in the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\n        After re-examining the second program, I see:\n\n          The code has a bug: it uses `''` (empty string) where it should use `' '` (space). So the intended behavior is to remove extra spaces and to ensure that punctuation is attached without a preceding space and then followed by a space. But because of the typo, it appends empty strings which are not visible.\n\n        How should we handle this?\n\n        The instructions say: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\"\n\n        So we have to run the second program as it is. Since the input to the second program is a string without any space, and with a decimal point, the second program:\n\n          - For the decimal point (which is in the punctuation list) will do:\n\n              if i>=1: \n                current char is '.' -> in punctuation -> \n                  if the last character in res is '' (empty string) -> which it never is (because we only appended non-empty until now) -> then we do:\n                    res.pop()   -> but only if the last was empty? We never appended an empty string until we get to the punctuation. So for the first time, we don't pop.\n\n                  then we append the '.' and then an empty string.\n\n          Then for the next digits, we append them normally.\n\n          When we print with `''.join(res)`, the empty strings become nothing. So the result is the same as the original.\n\n        Therefore, the second program does not change the string.\n\n        So the combined program should:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and 2*n floats.\n\n          Step 2: Compute the result as the first program and format it as a string with three decimal places.\n\n          Step 3: Pass that string to the second program, which will output the same string.\n\n        But wait: the second program might have edge effects? For example, if the first program's output had a space? But it doesn't.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? Then we can skip the second program? But we are required to combine.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must include the second program even if it does nothing.\n\n        Alternatively, the second program might be intended for a different purpose? But the problem states that the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n        Since the second program does not change the string in this specific case, we can simply output the result of the first program? But to be safe, we must simulate the second program.\n\n        How to simulate:\n\n          We have a string s (the formatted float from the first program).\n\n          We create an array (or a string builder) for the result of the second program.\n\n          We traverse the string s:\n\n            For index i=0:\n              if the character is space -> skip? (because the first condition: if i>=1? no, so we go to the else part for the first character: \n                if s[0] is space? then continue (skip) -> but we don't have space, so then if it's in punctuation? -> skip? (the code says: if in punctuation then continue? meaning skip). But wait, the code for i==0:\n\n                  if s[i] == '' -> no, so then if s[i] in punctuation -> skip? (continue) -> but we don't skip if it's not punctuation? \n\n                Actually:\n\n                  else: (if not space)\n                    if in punctuation: continue -> meaning skip the punctuation at the beginning? But we have a decimal point? Then we skip the decimal point? Then we don't output the decimal point? That would be wrong.\n\n          Let me reexamine the code for i==0:\n\n            if i>=1 -> false, so we go to the else part (the outer else).\n\n            then:\n              if s[i] == '':  -> if it's space? (but we have no space) -> then continue? skip? -> no, because it's not space.\n\n              if s[i] in punctuation: then continue -> meaning skip the character? -> but then we don't append anything.\n\n              else: append the character.\n\n          So for the first character: if it's a digit, we append; if it's punctuation (like '.' at the beginning) we skip.\n\n          Example: \"1.234\" -> \n            i=0: '1' -> not space, not punctuation -> append -> res = ['1']\n            i=1: '.' -> punctuation -> then we do: \n                  if res[-1] is '' (empty) -> no, so we pop? no, we don't. Then we append '.' and then an empty string -> res = ['1', '.', '']\n            i=2: '2' -> not space -> then we append '2' -> res = ['1', '.', '', '2'] ... but when we join, the empty string is nothing -> \"1.2\"\n\n          However, wait: the code for i>=1:\n\n            if s[i] is space: ... (we skip because it's not space)\n            else:\n              if s[i] in punctuation: \n                 if res[-1] is '' -> we check the last element: at i=1, the last element is '1' (so not empty) -> then we do:\n                    res.append('.') -> now res becomes ['1', '.'] \n                    then res.append('') -> becomes ['1', '.', '']\n              else: ... (for i=2, we go to the else and append '2')\n\n          Then the result is \"1.\" + \"\" + \"2\" ... -> \"1.2\" ... which is \"1.2\" (but we had 3 more digits?).\n\n          Actually, the entire string \"1.234\" is processed as:\n\n            i=0: '1' -> append -> \"1\"\n            i=1: '.' -> in punctuation -> \n                  if the last character in res is ''? It's '1' -> no, so we append '.' -> now res = \"1.\" \n                  then we append '' -> so res = \"1.\" and then an empty string? Then we have two elements: ['1', '.', '']? Actually, we have three elements: at index0='1', index1='.', index2='' (empty string).\n            i=2: '2' -> not space -> not punctuation -> append -> now we have ['1','.','','2']\n            i=3: '3' -> append -> ... then i=4: '4' -> append.\n\n          Then we get \"1\" + \".\" + \"\" + \"2\" + \"3\" + \"4\" = \"1.234\"\n\n          So the empty strings are not printed? Then the output is \"1.234\", same as input.\n\n        Therefore, the second program does not change the string.\n\n        But note: the decimal point is in the middle and we are appending an empty string after it. Then the rest of the digits are appended. The empty string doesn't affect.\n\n        So we can simulate the second program by:\n\n          We'll create a dynamic array (or we can use a fixed size buffer) to build the result.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let res be a dynamic array (or a string) we are building.\n\n            We traverse the input string s (which is the output of the first program) character by character.\n\n            For i=0:\n\n              if s[0] is space -> skip (but we don't have space) -> then check: if it is in punctuation? -> skip? but we skip the punctuation? But wait, the code for i=0:\n\n                  if s[0] == '': skip (continue) -> but if it's not space, then if it's in punctuation -> skip (continue) -> meaning we don't append.\n\n                  else: append.\n\n            For i>=1:\n\n              if s[i] is space:\n\n                 if the last character in res is not an empty string? -> but note: in our representation, we are storing characters. How do we represent empty string? We can't store an empty string in a character array. We are storing characters. So the condition in the original code is flawed.\n\n          Given the confusion and the fact that the input to the second program is a string without spaces and the decimal point is the only punctuation, and the decimal point is not at the beginning, we can note:\n\n            The first character is a digit -> appended.\n\n            Then the decimal point: we append it and then an empty string? But in C, we cannot put an empty string in the middle of a character array. We are building a string of characters.\n\n          How did the Python code work? The Python code stored a list of strings. Each element is either a one-character string or an empty string. Then when we join, the empty string becomes nothing.\n\n          In C, we can simulate by:\n\n            We will build a buffer (array of characters) and we also need to remember the last character we appended? But note: the condition in the second program checks the last element in `res` (the list) for being an empty string. How do we store an empty string? We cannot. So we must represent the list of tokens? Alternatively, we note that the second program is flawed and for the specific input (the float string) it does nothing.\n\n        But to be faithful, we must simulate the exact steps.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must code the second program as given.\n\n        But note: the second program in the provided code uses `''` (empty string). We must represent that in C. How?\n\n          We can represent the list `res` as an array of strings? But that complicates.\n\n        Alternatively, we note that the input to the second program is a string that only contains digits and a decimal point. And the operations:\n\n          - When we see a space: we skip if the last token was space? But we never have space.\n\n          - When we see a punctuation (the decimal point): we do:\n\n              if the last token we stored is an empty string -> then we remove that empty string (pop) and then push the punctuation and then push an empty string.\n\n          But in our case, the last token before the decimal point is a digit (a non-empty string). So we just push the decimal point and then an empty string.\n\n          Then we push the following digits.\n\n          Then when we print, we print each token without any separator. The empty string token is printed as nothing.\n\n        So the result is the same.\n\n        How to do in C?\n\n          We can use an array of strings? But that is heavy. Alternatively, we note that the tokens we push are either:\n\n            - One-character string (for the digit or the decimal point)\n            - Or the empty string.\n\n          And the only time we push an empty string is after a punctuation.\n\n          But when we output, we just output the characters and the empty string is output as nothing.\n\n          So we can simply output the original string? Because the empty strings don't appear.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the second program? But we must do as the chain.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate without storing tokens: we can traverse the input string and write to an output buffer. But note:\n\n          The operations:\n\n            For i=0:\n\n              if the char is not space and not punctuation -> we output it.\n\n            For i>=1:\n\n              if it's space:\n\n                 if the last character we output is not space -> then output space; else skip.\n\n              else:\n\n                 if it's punctuation:\n\n                    if the last character we output is space -> then we remove that space (so we have to backtrack) and then output the punctuation and then output nothing? (for the empty string) -> but we can skip the nothing.\n\n                    else: output the punctuation.\n\n                 else: output the character.\n\n          But note: the condition for punctuation also appends an empty string? How do we output nothing? We just output the punctuation and then nothing? That is the same as just outputting the punctuation.\n\n          However, the code does: after the punctuation, it appends an empty string. Then when we see the next character (a digit), we output the digit. So we have: ... punctuation then digit. There's no space.\n\n        But wait: the empty string is stored in the list. Then when we next see a digit, we just append the digit. Then when we join, we get the punctuation immediately followed by the digit. So the empty string doesn't insert anything.\n\n        Therefore, we can ignore the empty string? We can simulate by:\n\n          We'll use a buffer (character array) for the output of the second program.\n\n          We'll also keep an index (say `len_res`) for the current length of the buffer.\n\n          And we'll also remember the last character we wrote? But note: the condition checks the last token (which might be an empty string) but we never wrote an empty string. We only wrote non-empty characters? But we are going to simulate the token list with a character array? How do we represent an empty string token? We cannot.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the input to the second program is a float string without spaces, we can note:\n\n          The second program will:\n\n            - Output the first character (if it's a digit) -> because it's not space and not punctuation? Actually, the first character might be '-'? But the first program outputs a nonnegative float? Because it's an absolute value? The first program: `res = min(res, abs(i - arr_sum))` -> so nonnegative. So first character is a digit.\n\n            - Then for the decimal point: we output the decimal point. Then we would \"output\" an empty string? We do nothing.\n\n            - Then the rest of the digits: we output them.\n\n          So the output is the same as the input.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the second program and output the first program's result? But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". And the chain does run the second program.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we are not allowed to print the intermediate result. We must store it and then pass to the second program without I/O.\n\n        And then the second program processes it and then we output the result.\n\n        But note: the second program's output is the same as its input? Then we can simply output the result of the first program? But we must be cautious.\n\n        How about we run the second program on the string from the first program and then output the result? Since the second program doesn't change the string, we can just output the first program's result.\n\n        But to be safe, let's write the second program in C as described, even if it does nothing.\n\n        Steps for the second program in C:\n\n          We are given a string `s` (the formatted float from the first program).\n\n          We'll create a buffer `res` of characters. We'll also have an array that can hold \"tokens\", but note: the tokens are either one char or empty. We can represent:\n\n            - For a non-empty token: we put the character.\n            - For an empty token: we put a special marker? But then we have to remove it when we see a space before a punctuation? And also when we output, we skip the marker? \n\n          Alternatively, we can simulate the token list by storing an array of strings? But we are in C and the string is small (the float string is at most 10-20 characters). We can use an array of char*? But that is heavy.\n\n        Another idea: we note that the operations of the second program on a string without spaces and without consecutive spaces and without leading/trailing spaces is a no-op? \n\n        However, let's re-implement the second program in C without the empty string tokens? Because the empty string token does not affect the output: it's printed as nothing. And we never have to remove it? The only removal is when we see a punctuation and the last token is an empty string -> we pop the empty string. But we never push an empty string before we see a punctuation? So we only push an empty string after a punctuation. Then if we see a punctuation again? It won't happen in our float string.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate by:\n\n          We traverse the input string and we build a new string (in a buffer) that is the same as the input? \n\n          But we must follow the algorithm:\n\n            We'll create an array `res` (as a buffer) and we'll also maintain an index `res_index` for the next position to write.\n\n            However, the algorithm sometimes pops (removes the last token) when:\n\n              if we see a punctuation and the last token is empty string -> then we pop (remove the last token). But we never have an empty string token? So we skip.\n\n            Also, the algorithm sometimes does not append a space if there was a space just before.\n\n          How about we skip the empty string tokens? We note that when the code says `res.append('')`, we do nothing? Then the algorithm becomes:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)):\n              if i>=1:\n                if s[i]==' ':   # note: in C, we represent space by ' '\n                  if (res is not empty and the last token we put in res is not space) -> then we put a space? But wait, the original code checks the last token: if it's not space, then we append space; else skip.\n\n                  However, we are not storing tokens, we are storing characters. And the last token is the last character. But note: the code uses `res[-1]` to check. So we can use the last character.\n\n                else:\n                  if s[i] is in punctuation: \n                    if (res is not empty and the last character we put is space) -> then we remove that space (by moving the index back) and then we put the punctuation and then we do nothing (for the empty string).\n                    else: we put the punctuation.\n                  else: put the character.\n\n              else: # i==0\n                if s[0]==' ': skip.\n                else if (strchr(punctuation, s[0])): skip.\n                else: put the character.\n\n          But note: the original code for the punctuation case appends an empty string. We skip that.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            We'll use a buffer `res` of size (say) 1000.\n\n            We'll have an index `j` (current length).\n\n            Punctuation: we have a string \",.!?\" and also include '.'.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              for (int i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n                if (i==0) {\n                  if (s[i]==' ') continue;\n                  else if (strchr(\",.!?\", s[i])) continue;\n                  else {\n                    res[j++] = s[i];\n                  }\n                } else {\n                  if (s[i]==' ') {\n                    // if the last character in res is not space, then append space; else skip.\n                    if (j>0 && res[j-1]!=' ') {\n                      res[j++] = ' ';\n                    }\n                  } else {\n                    if (strchr(\",.!?\", s[i])) {\n                      // if the last character in res is space, then remove that space\n                      if (j>0 && res[j-1]==' ') {\n                        j--; // remove the last space\n                      }\n                      res[j++] = s[i]; // append the punctuation\n                      // and then we skip the empty string: do nothing.\n                    } else {\n                      res[j++] = s[i];\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            res[j] = '\\0';\n\n          Then we output the string `res`.\n\n        But note: in the original code, after appending the punctuation, they append an empty string. We skip that. So we are not representing the empty string. But the empty string is printed as nothing. So the result is the same.\n\n        However, the original code also has the empty string in the list. Then when the next character comes, it is appended after the empty string. But when we output, we skip the empty string. So the next character will be after the punctuation? Which is the same as what we did.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate without the empty string.\n\n        But note: what if after the punctuation we get a space? Then the space would be appended after the punctuation? But the original code: after the punctuation, we have an empty string and then a space? Then the rule for space: if the last token is space? -> no, it's an empty string -> then we would append the space? But in our simulation, after the punctuation we have no token? Then we would append the space? \n\n        However, the input to the second program is a float string: no space after the decimal point. So we are safe.\n\n        So we'll do:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and then 2*n doubles.\n\n          Step 2: Compute the first program's result and format it as a string with three decimal places.\n\n          Step 3: Process that string with the above C code for the second program.\n\n          Step 4: Output the result of the second program.\n\n        However, note: the first program's output is a string that might have a minus sign? But no, because we take absolute value: `res = min(res, abs(i - arr_sum))` -> so nonnegative.\n\n        Example: the first program outputs a string like \"1.234\" or \"0.000\" or \"123.456\".\n\n        Now, let's test the second program on \"1.234\":\n\n          i=0: '1' -> not space, not punctuation -> append -> res = \"1\", j=1.\n          i=1: '.' -> punctuation -> \n                j>0 -> true, res[j-1] is '1' (not space) -> then we do: \n                  res[j++] = '.' -> now res = \"1.\" and j=2.\n                then we skip the empty string.\n          i=2: '2' -> not punctuation -> append -> res = \"1.2\", j=3.\n          i=3: '3' -> append -> \"1.23\", j=4.\n          i=4: '4' -> append -> \"1.234\", j=5.\n\n          Then we get \"1.234\", same as input.\n\n        Now test on a string with a space? But we don't have.\n\n        Therefore, the second program doesn't change the string.\n\n        But to be safe, we'll code it as described.\n\n        Summary of the C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n          #include <math.h>\n\n          #define MAX_N 100000\n          #define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 1000000\n\n          int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read n\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            // Then read the next line: 2*n doubles\n            double *arr = (double*)malloc(2 * n * sizeof(double));\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%lf\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // First program logic:\n\n            // Create an array for fractional parts (if fractional part is non-zero)\n            double *fracs = (double*)malloc(2 * n * sizeof(double));\n            int count = 0; // count of non-integer numbers\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {\n                double frac = arr[i] - (long long)arr[i]; // fractional part\n                // If negative? The problem uses positive? The input is positive? \n                // But note: the input is float and positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the absolute value at the end is nonnegative.\n                // However, if the number is negative, we should adjust. But the problem says: fractional part of a negative number?\n                // Let me check: in Python, if x is negative, then x - int(x) might be negative? \n                // Example: x = -1.5 -> int(x) is -2? or -1? \n                // In Python, int(-1.5) is -1? Actually, it truncates toward zero? \n                // But note: the fractional part is defined as x - int(x). For negative numbers, int(x) is the next lower integer? \n                // Actually, in Python, int(-1.5) is -1? Then fractional part: -1.5 - (-1) = -0.5? \n                // But the condition: if x - int(x) != 0 -> then we take it. Then we have a negative fractional part.\n\n                // The problem does not specify the sign of the input. But the example input? We are not given.\n\n                // To be safe, we use the same method as Python: fractional part = x - (long long)x; \n                // But note: for negative, we might get negative fractional part? Then when we sort, negative fractional parts will come first.\n\n                // Alternatively, we can use: \n                //   frac = fmod(arr[i], 1.0);\n                // But fmod can return negative for negative numbers? \n                // The problem: we want the fractional part as defined in Python: x - floor(x) is always in [0,1) for nonnegative, but for negative? \n                // Actually, the original Python code: x - int(x). The int() function truncates toward zero? So for negative, fractional part can be negative? \n\n                // How about we adjust to be nonnegative? But the problem uses the same as Python.\n\n                // Let's stick to: \n                //   double int_part;\n                //   double frac = modf(arr[i], &int_part);\n                // But modf returns fractional part with the same sign? \n                //   For negative: modf(-1.5, &int_part) returns -0.5 and sets int_part to -1.0? \n                // But the Python code uses: x - int(x). For -1.5: int(x) is -1? Then x - int(x) = -1.5 - (-1) = -0.5.\n\n                // So we do:\n                double frac_part = arr[i] - (long long)arr[i];\n                // But if the number is negative and not integer, we might have a negative frac_part? \n                // The condition: if frac_part != 0, we include.\n                if (fabs(frac_part) > 1e-9) { // avoid rounding errors? but the problem says \"if x - int(x) != 0\"\n                    fracs[count++] = frac_part;\n                }\n            }\n\n            int o = 2 * n - count; // the number of integers (with fractional part 0)\n\n            // Sort the fractional parts\n            qsort(fracs, count, sizeof(double), compare_double);\n\n            double arr_sum = 0.0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n                arr_sum += fracs[i];\n            }\n\n            double res = 2e9; // as in the Python: int(2e9)\n\n            // for i in range(n+1)\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                if (i + o >= n) {\n                    double diff = fabs(i - arr_sum);\n                    if (diff < res) {\n                        res = diff;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Format the result as a string with three decimal places.\n            char first_output[50];\n            snprintf(first_output, 50, \"%.3f\", res);\n\n            // Now, first_output is the input to the second program.\n\n            // Step for the second program:\n\n            // We'll create a buffer for the result of the second program.\n            char second_output[1000]; // large enough\n            int j = 0; // index for second_output\n\n            // Define the punctuation string\n            char *punctuation = \",.!?\";\n\n            for (int i = 0; first_output[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                if (i == 0) {\n                    if (first_output[i] == ' ') {\n                        continue;\n                    } else if (strchr(punctuation, first_output[i])) {\n                        continue;\n                    } else {\n                        second_output[j++] = first_output[i];\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    if (first_output[i] == ' ') {\n                        if (j > 0 && second_output[j-1] != ' ') {\n                            second_output[j++] = ' ';\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        if (strchr(punctuation, first_output[i])) {\n                            if (j > 0 && second_output[j-1] == ' ') {\n                                j--; // remove the last space\n                            }\n                            second_output[j++] = first_output[i];\n                            // Skip appending empty string: do nothing.\n                        } else {\n                            second_output[j++] = first_output[i];\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            second_output[j] = '\\0';\n\n            // Output the result of the second program.\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", second_output);\n\n            free(arr);\n            free(fracs);\n            return 0;\n          }\n\n          We need a comparison function for qsort:\n\n          int compare_double(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            double arg1 = *(const double*)a;\n            double arg2 = *(const double*)b;\n            if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n            if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n            return 0;\n          }\n\n        But note: the fractional parts can be negative? Then we sort negative ones first? The Python sorted() does the same.\n\n        However, the absolute value at the end is computed on `i - arr_sum`? And `i` is nonnegative, and `arr_sum` is the sum of fractional parts (which can be negative). \n\n        But the problem: the fractional parts are taken as `x - int(x)`. For negative numbers, the fractional part is negative? Then the sum `arr_sum` can be negative? Then `i - arr_sum` = i - (negative) = i + positive? Then the absolute value is taken.\n\n        But the first program: `res = min(res, abs(i - arr_sum))` -> so it's the absolute value.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the input numbers. But the original Python program handles negative fractional parts.\n\n        We'll do the same.\n\n        One more note: the fractional part for negative numbers: we did `(long long)arr[i]`? This truncates toward zero? For negative, it truncates to the next integer toward zero? So for -1.5, (long long)(-1.5) is -1? Then fractional part = -1.5 - (-1) = -0.5.\n\n        But in C, when casting double to long long, it truncates toward zero? Yes.\n\n        Therefore, we are consistent.\n\n        Let me test on a negative: arr[i] = -1.5 -> fractional part = -0.5.\n\n        Then we sort: if we have both positive and negative, negative will come first.\n\n        Then the sum: we add negative and positive.\n\n        It should be the same as the Python.\n\n        However, note: the condition in the first program: `arr = sorted([x - int(x) for x in arr if x - int(x) != 0])`. So negative fractional parts are included and sorted.\n\n        We do the same.\n\n        But note: the fractional part for -1.0? Then x - int(x) = 0 -> skip.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        However, there is a potential issue: the fractional part might be negative zero? But in C, we use `fabs(frac_part) > 1e-9` to check non-zero. But negative zero is zero? So we skip.\n\n        Therefore, we write the C code as described.\n\n        Note: the input size: we assume n can be up to 100000? We use malloc for arr and fracs.\n\n        We also assume the input numbers are within the range of double.\n\n        We'll write the comparison function for doubles.\n\n        One more note: the formatted string for the first program: we use \"%.3f\". This might round the result. The Python does the same.\n\n        Let me test: in Python, if res = 0.0005, then \"%.3f\" would round to 0.001? Yes.\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n        Now, let's code.\n\n        We assume the input has no extra characters.\n\n        We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n        We'll also be cautious for the second program: the buffer for the second program must be large enough.\n\n        The first program's output: at most 50 characters. Then the second program output: we have a buffer of 1000.\n\n        We'll write the entire code.\n\n        Note: the second program might remove trailing spaces? But we don't have any.\n\n        We output the second_output string.\n\n        Let me write the code."
