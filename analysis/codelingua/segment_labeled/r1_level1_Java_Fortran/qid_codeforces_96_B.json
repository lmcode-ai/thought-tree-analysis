  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. The program reads a number, then generates binary numbers starting from mask = 2. For each mask, it converts it to a binary string, skips the first character (substring(1)), then checks if the number of zeros equals the number of ones. If they do, it replaces 0s with 4s and 1s with 7s to form a number, and finds the smallest such number greater than or equal to the input.\n\nFirst, let's think about the main components. The loop starts with mask = 2 and increments. Each mask is converted to a binary string, but the substring(1) part removes the leading '1'. So for example, mask=2 is binary '10', substring(1) gives '0', mask=3 is '11' \u2192 '1', mask=4 is '100' \u2192 '00', etc. Then, the code counts zeros and checks if the count is equal to the number of ones (since length - zeros is the ones). If equal, proceed to create the number.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's start by reading the input as a long integer. Then, loop with mask starting at 2 and increment each time. For each mask, generate the binary string without the leading '1'.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in function to convert an integer to a binary string. So I'll need to write a function to do that. Wait, but the mask is a variable that starts at 2 and increments. Let's see, how to generate the binary string without the leading 1. For example, mask=2 is 10 in binary. We take substring starting from index 1 (assuming 0-based?), but in Java, substring(1) starts from index 1. So for mask=2, binary is '10' \u2192 substring(1) is '0'. So the binary string after removing the first character is the part after the leading 1. So the mask starts at 2 (binary 10), then 3 (11), 4 (100), etc. So the binary strings after the leading 1 are '0', '1', '00', '01', etc. So the generated strings are all possible combinations of 0s and 1s, but such that the total length is even (since zeros must equal ones). Wait, no. Because zeros and ones need to be equal. So the length of the substring is even. For example, in the original code, s.length() is the length of the substring (after removing the leading 1). Then zeros equals s.length() - zeros \u2192 which implies that zeros = s.length()/2. So s must have even length.\n\nSo, in the loop, mask increases, and the binary string after removing the leading 1 can vary in length. But the zeros and ones must be equal. So s's length must be even.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input number as a long integer.\n\n2. Initialize variables: ans = -1 (but not used?), value = 0, mask = 2.\n\n3. While value < number, loop:\n\n   a. Convert mask to binary string, then remove the leading '1'.\n\n   b. Count zeros in this string. If zeros != length/2, skip.\n\n   c. Replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\n   d. Convert the resulting string to a number. If this number is >= input, exit loop and print.\n\nBut wait, the loop continues until value >= number, so the first value that meets the condition is printed. So the code finds the smallest number made of 4s and 7s with equal count of each, and >= input.\n\nNow, how to generate the binary string in Fortran. Let's write a function to convert an integer to binary, then remove the leading '1'. For example, mask=2 \u2192 binary is 10 \u2192 remove first character \u2192 '0'.\n\nFunction to convert integer to binary:\n\nBut in Fortran, handling binary conversion can be done by repeatedly dividing by 2 and getting the remainders, then reversing the string. But the mask starts at 2, so for mask=2:\n\nbinary_str = '10' \u2192 after removing first character \u2192 '0'.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 '11' \u2192 '1'.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 '100' \u2192 '00'.\n\nSo the function to convert mask to binary, then take substring from index 2 (since Fortran strings are 1-based). Wait, in Java, mask is converted to binary via Integer.toBinaryString(mask), which for mask=2 is \"10\". Then substring(1) gives \"0\". So in Fortran, after converting mask to binary, we need to take the substring starting from position 2.\n\nSo, the steps for each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary as a string.\n\n- Remove the first character (since the first character is '1' because mask starts at 2 and increments. Wait, mask is 2, binary is '10'; mask=3, '11'; mask=4, '100'; mask=5, '101', etc. All binary representations start with '1', so removing the first character gives the rest.\n\nSo in Fortran, once we have the binary string, take the substring from index 2 to the end.\n\nSo, for example, binary_str = '10' \u2192 substr(binary_str, 2) \u2192 '0'.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary conversion.\n\nImplementing binary conversion in Fortran:\n\nFunction to convert an integer to a binary string:\n\nfunction to_binary(n) result(bin_str)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n    integer :: temp, i\n    temp = n\n    bin_str = ''\n    do while (temp > 0)\n        i = mod(temp, 2)\n        if (i == 0) then\n            bin_str = '0' // bin_str\n        else\n            bin_str = '1' // bin_str\n        end if\n        temp = temp / 2\n    end do\n    if (bin_str == '') then\n        bin_str = '0'\n    end if\nend function\n\nWait, but mask starts at 2. So for mask=2, binary is '10', mask=3 is '11', etc. So the function would generate the correct binary string.\n\nOnce we have the binary string, we take the substring starting at position 2. So s = bin_str(2:).\n\nBut what if the binary string is only 1 character long? Well, mask starts at 2, which is '10' (2 digits), so the binary_str for mask >=2 will have length at least 2, so substr(2:) will not be empty.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen, for s, count the number of '0's and check if the count is equal to half the length. For example, if s has length 2, zeros must be 1. If length is 4, zeros must be 2, etc.\n\nOnce the zeros count is correct, replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\nThen, convert the resulting string to a number (as a long integer), and check if it's >= input. The loop continues until value >= number, and then outputs the value.\n\nNow, the Fortran code needs to implement these steps.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Handling large numbers. The original Java code uses long (64-bit). In Fortran, integers can be of kind 8 (64-bit), but the string conversion may need to handle very large numbers, which might exceed Fortran's integer capacity. So perhaps using a character string and then converting to a integer (if possible) or using a real (but that's not precise). Wait, the Java code uses Long.parseLong(s), but if the generated number is very large (like 444...777...), then it could exceed the 64-bit integer limit. But in the original code, the loop runs until value < number, and the input is a long, so maybe the code is designed for numbers that fit in a 64-bit integer.\n\nIn Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes (64-bit), so we can use integer(kind=8) for variables.\n\nBut converting a string to an integer in Fortran can be done with read statement. However, if the string is too long, it might cause overflow. So, perhaps the code is designed for numbers that fit within 64 bits. So assuming that the generated number can be stored as a 64-bit integer.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input as a integer(kind=8).\n\n- Initialize variables: mask as integer (since mask starts at 2 and increments each iteration). But when mask increases, for example, mask=2,3,4,..., the binary string's length increases. But in the original code, mask is an integer (Java's int), which is 32 bits. So mask can be up to 2^31-1, but the binary string for that would be 31 characters. After removing the first character, the length is 30. So zeros and ones each 15. So the generated number has 30 digits. But 30 digits is way beyond 64-bit integer's capacity (which is 19 digits). So, perhaps the original code has a flaw when the input is very large. But the user is providing code that works, so perhaps the problem expects that the input is within the range that the generated number can fit into a 64-bit integer.\n\nBut when translating to Fortran, we need to handle the conversion from string to integer. So if the generated s has, say, 18 digits (which is manageable), then read into integer(kind=8). But if longer, overflow occurs and the code would fail.\n\nBut given that the original code uses Long.parseLong, which can handle up to 18 digits (since 2^63-1 is 9223372036854775807, 19 digits), but the code would fail if s is longer than that. So the code is correct as per the problem's constraints.\n\nSo in Fortran, when converting the string to integer(kind=8), we need to read the string into a variable of that kind. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nLoop mask from 2 upwards:\n\nFor each mask:\n\n1. Convert to binary string.\n\n2. Remove the first character.\n\n3. Count zeros. If zeros is not equal to half the length of s, skip.\n\n4. Replace '0' with '4', '1' with '7'.\n\n5. Convert to integer. If this value >= input, then exit and print.\n\nSo, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the binary conversion function.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't return allocatable strings of variable length in some versions, but in modern Fortran, they can. So let's write a function to_binary that converts an integer to a binary string.\n\nThen, after obtaining the binary string, s is the substring starting from position 2.\n\nThen count the number of '0's in s.\n\nIf the count of zeros is equal to len(s)/2 (since len(s) must be even for zeros and ones to be equal), then proceed.\n\nThen replace '0's and '1's with '4's and '7's.\n\nThen, read the string as an integer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Fortran, the mask needs to be an integer. However, as mask can become large (since the original code uses mask++ as a loop variable), but in practice, for numbers up to 1e18, mask may not get too big. But in Fortran, integers can be 32-bit, which would limit mask to 2^31-1, but perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nBut in the original code, mask is an int, which is 32 bits. So in Fortran, mask can be a 32-bit integer (integer(kind=4)).\n\nBut perhaps better to use integer(kind=8) to avoid overflow for mask. But in practice, the loop may take a long time for large numbers.\n\nBut the problem is to translate the code as is. So let's proceed.\n\nHere's the code structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_96_B\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: number, value, ans\n    integer :: mask\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s, bin_str\n    integer :: zeros, i, length\n    logical :: valid\n    character(len=100) :: buffer !

Replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's\n            s = replace(s, '0', '4')\n            s = replace(s, '1', '7')\n            !

No, in Java, mask is an int, as mask is declared as int mask = 2, and then mask++. So in Fortran, mask can be a default integer (assuming 32-bit). But if the loop runs many times, mask may overflow. But for the purposes of this translation, we'll proceed as per the original.\n\nBut in Fortran, mask is declared as integer (default kind, which is typically 4 bytes). So after mask reaches 2^31-1, it will overflow. But perhaps the problem expects that the input is such that the loop will terminate before mask overflows. So proceed.\n\nNow, the replace function: in Fortran, strings are fixed-length, but using allocatable strings can help. The replace function takes a string and replaces each occurrence of old_char with new_char. The replace function is written here.\n\nBut the function replace is called with '0' to '4' and then '1' to '7'. But after replacing '0's with '4's, then replacing '1's with '7's, which are not affected by the previous replacement.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after generating the binary string (s), which consists of 0s and 1s (after removing the leading 1), the code replaces '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's. So in Fortran, the code needs to do the same.\n\nSo the replace function is applied twice. First, replace '0's with '4's, then replace '1's with '7's.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ns = replace(s, '0', '4')\ns = replace(s, '1', '7')\n\nBut in Fortran, since strings are manipulated, each replace creates a new string.\n\nBut in the code above, the line is:\n\ns = replace(s, '0', '4')\n\nThen s = replace(s, '1', '7')\n\nSo first, replace 0s with 4s, then replace 1s with 7s. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the conversion from s to value. The read statement may fail if s is empty. But in the code, mask starts at 2, which gives binary '10' \u2192 s is '0', so after replacement, '4' \u2192 value 4. So for mask=2, s is '0' \u2192 after replacement, '4' \u2192 value 4. Then if the input is, say, 4, then value is 4, and the loop exits.\n\nBut what about leading zeros in the generated s? For example, mask=4 is binary '100' \u2192 s is '00'. Replaced to '44', which is 44. So the code would read that as 44. So leading zeros are allowed in the string, and when read as an integer, they are part of the number.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading a string like '0044' into an integer, the leading zeros are ignored, so it becomes 44. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the original Java code, when converting the string to a long, leading zeros are allowed. For example, Long.parseLong(\"0044\") is 44. So the Fortran code's read statement will also parse leading zeros correctly.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. The binary conversion function. Let's test mask=2 \u2192 binary '10' \u2192 s is '0'. Then zeros is 1. len(s) is 1. len(s) is 1, which is odd. So zeros would not be equal to len(s)/2. So mask=2 is skipped. Wait, but in the Java code, mask starts at 2. Let's see:\n\nmask starts at 2, binary is '10', substring(1) \u2192 '0'. zeros is 1. s.length() is 1. zeros != (1- zeros) \u2192 1 != 0. So the code skips. Then mask increments to 3.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary '11' \u2192 substring(1) \u2192 '1'. zeros is 0. s.length() is 1. 0 != 1 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 '100' \u2192 substring(1) \u2192 '00'. zeros is 2. s.length() is 2. 2 == 2/2 \u2192 2 == 1? No. So zeros is 2, length is 2. So 2 equals 2/2 \u2192 2 equals 1? No. So condition fails. So mask=4 is skipped.\n\nWait, in Java code, the condition is if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue; So zeros == s.length() - zeros \u2192 2 zeros in a length 2 string \u2192 2 zeros, 0 ones \u2192 2 == 0? No. So mask=4 is skipped.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the code is looking for exactly the same number of zeros and ones in the substring. So for mask=4, substring is '00', zeros is 2, s.length() - zeros is 0 \u2192 2 != 0 \u2192 skipped.\n\nSo the code is looking for s where zeros == (length of s) - zeros \u2192 zeros = length / 2.\n\nSo the code requires that the number of zeros is exactly half the length of s. So the length must be even.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after counting zeros, check if zeros == len(s)/2.\n\nBut len(s) must be even. So in the code, mask=5: binary is 101 \u2192 substring is '01' \u2192 len=2. zeros=1. 1 == 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo s is '01' \u2192 replaced to '47' \u2192 47. So if the input is 47, value is 47.\n\nSo in the code, when mask increments, the binary strings are processed, and when s has equal number of 0s and 1s, then the code proceeds.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should have:\n\nif (mod(length, 2) == 0) then\n\n    if (zeros == length / 2) then\n\n        ... process ...\n\n    end if\n\nelse\n\n    cycle\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the code in the original Java code does not check for even length. It just checks if zeros == s.length() - zeros. Which implies that 2*zeros = s.length(). So s.length() must be even, because zeros is an integer.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the check for zeros == length/2 implicitly requires that length is even.\n\nSo perhaps the code in Fortran can just do:\n\nif (zeros == len(s)/2) then\n\nBut since len(s) is an integer, division truncates. So, for example, len(s) is 3, zeros == 1.5 \u2192 which is impossible, but zeros is an integer. So the code would only pass when len(s) is even.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, it's possible to remove the check for even length and proceed with the zeros check.\n\nBut in the original code, when len(s) is odd, zeros can't be equal to len(s) - zeros. So in Fortran code, it's safe to just check zeros == len(s)/2, but since len(s) is integer, len(s)/2 would be integer division, which truncates. So for example, if len(s) is 3, len(s)/2 is 1. So if zeros is 1, 1 == 1 (but len(s) is 3), but zeros == len(s) - zeros \u2192 1 == 3-1 \u2192 1=2 \u2192 no. So the code would not process len(s) odd.\n\nWait, no. len(s) is 3, zeros is 1. len(s) - zeros is 2. So zeros (1) is not equal to 2. So the code skips.\n\nBut in Fortran code, if len(s) is 3, then len(s)/2 is 1 (integer division). So zeros == 1 would pass, but the code would proceed. Which is incorrect.\n\nAh, here's a problem. In the original code, the condition is zeros == (s.length() - zeros), which is equivalent to 2*zeros == s.length(). But in Fortran, if len(s) is odd, 2*zeros can't equal it. So in Fortran code, when checking zeros == len(s)/2, but len(s) is divided as integer, which truncates. So for example, if len(s) is 3, len(s)/2 is 1. So if zeros is 1, then 1 == 1, but 2*1=2 !=3. So the code would erroneously process s of length 3 with zeros 1.\n\nThus, the code needs to check that len(s) is even, and that zeros is exactly half of the length.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, before checking zeros == len(s)/2, we should check that mod(len(s),2) is zero. Otherwise, cycle.\n\nSo the code in Fortran should have:\n\nlength = len(s)\n\nif (mod(length, 2) /= 0) cycle\n\nif (zeros == length/2) then\n\n    ...\n\nend if\n\nSo adding that check is necessary.\n\nIn the code I wrote earlier, that check is present. So that's correct.\n\nNow, test mask=5:\n\nmask=5 \u2192 binary is 101 \u2192 substring is '01' \u2192 len=2. zeros=1. 1 == 1 \u2192 yes. Replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927 \u2192 '47' \u2192 value 47.\n\nThus, the code would process this.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 4. The code would generate 4 (mask=2 is skipped because len(s) is 1 \u2192 odd. mask=3: s is '1', len=1 \u2192 odd. mask=4: s is '00', len=2. zeros=2. len/2 is 1. 2 != 1 \u2192 skipped. mask=5: s is '01', zeros 1 \u2192 1 ==1 \u2192 yes. '47' is 47 \u2192 value 47, which is >=4? Yes. So the code exits and prints 47? But wait, the code is supposed to find the first value >= input.\n\nWait, no. Let's see the original code:\n\nInitially, value=0. The loop runs while value < number.\n\nAt mask=5, the value is 47. If number is 4, then 47 >=4 \u2192 value is 47, which is >=4 \u2192 loop exits. So the code outputs 47.\n\nBut in this case, the correct answer should be 44 (from mask=4's s is '00' \u2192 replaced to '44', which is 44. But why isn't that processed?\n\nBecause mask=4's s is '00' \u2192 zeros is 2. len(s)=2 \u2192 len/2 is 1. 2 !=1 \u2192 so skipped.\n\nAh, right. So mask=4's s is '00', zeros=2. len(s)/2 is 1. 2 !=1 \u2192 condition fails. So the code skips mask=4.\n\nThus, the code proceeds to mask=5. So the code would output 47 when input is 4. But the correct answer would be 44. Wait, why?\n\nBecause the code in Java skips mask=4. Because when mask=4, the s is '00' \u2192 zeros is 2, which is not equal to (s.length() - zeros) \u2192 2 != 0. So the code skips.\n\nBut the correct answer for input 4 is 44, but the code would output 47. This suggests a bug in the original Java code.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let's test the original Java code.\n\nFor input 4:\n\nmask starts at 2. mask=2: binary is '10' \u2192 substring '0' \u2192 zeros=1. length 1. zeros != 1-1=0 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=3: '11' \u2192 '1' \u2192 zeros=0. 0 !=1 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=4: '100' \u2192 substring '00' \u2192 zeros=2. length 2. zeros != 2-2=0 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=5: '101' \u2192 '01' \u2192 zeros=1. 1 == 2-1 \u2192 1=1 \u2192 yes. So s becomes '47' \u2192 value=47.\n\nThus, the code outputs 47 for input 4, but the correct answer is 44. So the code has a bug.\n\nHmm. But according to the problem statement, maybe the code is correct. So in that case, the code is supposed to generate numbers with equal number of 4s and 7s. So 44 has two 4s, no 7s \u2192 invalid. So the code is correct in outputting 47.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the original code is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is correct as per the translation.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 8.\n\nThe code would need to find the first number >=8 that has equal 4s and 7s.\n\nThe candidates are 47, 74, 4477, etc. The smallest is 47.\n\nBut for input 8, the code would output 47.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly translate the original Java code."
