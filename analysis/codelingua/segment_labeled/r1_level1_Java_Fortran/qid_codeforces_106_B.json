  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the code reads an integer n, then reads n entries of four integers each into a 2D array called vec. Then, for each entry, it checks if there's another entry that has all three components (the first three elements) greater than the current one. If not, it considers that entry as a candidate and selects the one with the smallest price (the fourth element). The answer is the index (starting at 1) of that entry.\n\nHmm, Fortran has different syntax and structures. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. In Java, they use Scanner and read from System.in. In Fortran, I'll need to use READ statements. Also, Fortran uses static arrays, so I need to declare them with a fixed size. But since n is read from input, maybe I should first read n, then allocate the array dynamically.\n\nWait, Fortran 90 and later support allocatable arrays. So I can read n first, then allocate the vec array as (n,4) or (4,n)? Let me see. The Java code uses vec[i][0], vec[i][1], etc., so each row is a record. In Fortran, column-major order is default, but maybe it's easier to have vec(4, n) where each column is a record. Or maybe (n,4) as rows. Let's see. Let's define vec as a 2D array with dimensions (n,4), where each row represents a computer's specs.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n, check if there's a j where vec(i,1) < vec(j,1), vec(i,2) < vec(j,2), and vec(i,3) < vec(j,3). If any such j exists, then the current i is outdated. So, we only consider the ones that are not outdated, and pick the one with the smallest price.\n\nIn Fortran, loops are written with do loops. So, for i in 1 to n, set a flag fl to 1 (true), then loop j from 1 to n. If any j satisfies the three conditions, set fl to 0. After checking all j, if fl remains 1, check if the price is the minimum so far.\n\nAlso, the Java code uses 0-based indices, but Fortran uses 1-based by default. So the loop variables will start at 1. The answer is the original index (i+1 in Java, which becomes i in Fortran if the loop is 0-based). Wait, in the Java code, for each i (0-based), if it's not outdated, then compare its price. The answer is stored as ans = i + 1. So in Fortran, since loops are 1-based, the index i (from 1 to n) would directly correspond to ans = i.\n\nSo, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Allocate vec as a 2D array of size (n,4).\n\n3. Read each of the n lines into vec(i, 1:4) for i from 1 to n.\n\n4. Initialize ans and ansprice. In Java, ans starts at 500 and ansprice at 20000, which are larger than any possible inputs (since price is up to 2000 in the problem statement? Wait, the problem isn't given, but the original code initializes ansprice to 20000. So in Fortran, we can initialize ansprice to a large number, like 20000, and ans to 0.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes ans to 500 and ansprice to 20000, which are probably higher than possible values. Then, for each candidate, if the price is lower than ansprice, update ans and ansprice. So in Fortran, we can start with ansprice as a very large value (like 2e5) and ans as 0.\n\nThen, loop over each i from 1 to n:\n\n   fl = 1\n\n   loop j from 1 to n:\n\n      if vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) and vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) and vec(i,3) < vec(j,3), then set fl=0 and exit the j loop.\n\n   if fl == 1:\n\n      if vec(i,4) < ansprice:\n\n          ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n          ans = i\n\nSo, the answer is the index i (1-based) of the candidate with the smallest price.\n\nWait, the fourth component in the Java code is vec[i][3], which is the price. So in Fortran, if the array is (n,4), then for the i-th row, the price is vec(i,4).\n\nSo, in Fortran, the code would have:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   fl = 1\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) .and. vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) .and. vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) then\n\n          fl = 0\n\n          exit  ! exit the j loop early\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\n   if (fl == 1) then\n\n      if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n          ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n          ans = i\n\n      endif\n\n   endif\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, the logical operators are .and., and the syntax is different.\n\nNow, handling input. How to read the input? The input for each line is four integers: speed, ram, hdd, price.\n\nIn Java, for each i in 0..n-1, reads four integers into vec[i][0], vec[i][1], vec[i][2], vec[i][3]. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n, read vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4).\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading from standard input, each read statement typically reads a line. So perhaps read each line as four integers.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read using:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*,*) vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nSo the Fortran program structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, j, fl, ans, ansprice\n\n    integer, allocatable :: vec(:,:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(vec(n,4))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\n    end do\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    ansprice = 20000  ! as in Java code\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        fl = 1\n\n        do j = 1, n\n\n            if (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) .and. vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) .and. vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) then\n\n                fl = 0\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (fl == 1) then\n\n            if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n                ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n                ans = i\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, ans is initialized to 500, which may be larger than the possible n. But in Fortran, ans is initialized to 0. So perhaps the Java code's initial ans is a placeholder. But according to the code logic, if there's at least one candidate (fl==1), then ansprice would be updated. So if no candidates exist (which is impossible since if all are outdated, but for each i, there exists j where all three are larger, but then j must have a j' even larger, leading to a contradiction), but perhaps in code, the initial ansprice is 20000. So in Fortran, the same initial ansprice.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes ansprice to 20000. So in Fortran, ansprice = 20000, and ans is initialized to 0, but perhaps in the problem, the price can be up to 20000. But if all the candidates have higher price, the code would select the initial ans=0? That's a problem. Wait, no: in Java, the code initializes ansprice to 20000. Then, any candidate with price lower than 20000 would be considered. If there are no candidates (fl ==1), then ans remains 500, but according to the problem statement, is that possible?\n\nBut the problem says that the code should select the minimal price among the non-outdated ones. So if the initial ansprice is 20000, but all candidates have price higher than that, then no selection is made. But according to the problem's logic, there must be at least one candidate (since for each computer, if there's a newer one, that's a j, but then that j could be checked again. But in reality, the code will have at least one candidate. Because if every computer is outdated, then there's a chain of computers each being outdated by another, but in such a case, there must be a computer that is not outdated (like the one with maximum specs). So perhaps the code will always find at least one candidate.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps in Fortran, initializing ansprice to a very high value, like 20000, and ans to 0. Then, if no candidates are found (though logically impossible), ans would remain 0, but according to the problem, that's impossible.\n\nBut the Java code initializes ans to 500, which is perhaps a placeholder. But in practice, the code will find the minimal price.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, test case. Let's say n=3.\n\nSuppose:\n\nComputer 1: 1 1 1 100\n\nComputer 2: 2 2 2 200\n\nComputer 3: 3 3 3 300\n\nThen, computer 1 is outdated by 2 and 3. Computer 2 is outdated by 3. Computer 3 is not outdated. So ans is 3. The code would select computer 3.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would print 3.\n\nAnother test case: if all are not outdated. For example:\n\nn=2:\n\nComputer 1: 1 2 3 100\n\nComputer 2: 2 1 4 200\n\nCheck for i=1: compare with j=2. vec(1,1)=1 < 2, vec(1,2)=2 >1, so the three conditions are (1<2, 2>1, 3<4) \u2192 1 <2, 2 is not <1, so the condition is false. So j=2 does not make i=1 outdated. Then, j=1: comparing to itself. But vec(1,1) is equal to vec(j,1), so the condition is not all <.\n\nSo for i=1, fl remains 1. So it's a candidate. Similarly for i=2.\n\nThen, among them, the one with price 100 is selected.\n\nSo the code would output 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, converting the code as per the above.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code, the array is allocated as (n,4). So for each computer i, the four attributes are in vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4).\n\nYes. Then, in the loop, comparing vec(i,1) < vec(j,1), etc.\n\nThe code looks correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the program starts with program main, implicit none. Then variables are declared. Then read n, allocate the array.\n\nRead each line into vec(i, 1-4).\n\nThen, loop through each i, check for each j if any j makes i outdated.\n\nIf after checking all j, fl remains 1, then check the price.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nBut in the Java code, the answer is i+1, because in Java the indices are 0-based. In Fortran, the loop is 1-based, so ans = i. So when printed, it's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the translated code should work."
