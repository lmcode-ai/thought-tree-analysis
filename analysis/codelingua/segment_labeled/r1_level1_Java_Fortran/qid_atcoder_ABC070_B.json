  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the original code does first. The Java program reads four integers a, b, c, d. Then it checks their intervals to find the overlapping time. The main logic is about calculating the overlapping time between two intervals [a, b] and [c, d]. \n\nFirst, I'll need to replicate the input handling. In Java, they use a custom InputReader class with BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. But in Fortran, we'll just read from standard input. So I can read the four integers directly using READ(*,*) a, b, c, d.\n\nNext, the logic of the conditions:\n\nThe code checks if c > b or a > d, which means no overlap, so output 0. Then if a < c, the overlapping time is min(b,d) - c. Otherwise, they collect all four values into a list, sort them, and subtract the second element from the third. Wait, why? Let me think. Oh right, when the intervals are overlapping in a certain way, the middle two values in the sorted list give the start and end of the overlap. For example, if the intervals are [a, b] and [c, d], and they overlap such that a is between c and d, then when sorted, the overlap is between the second and third elements. But maybe the code is handling all cases where the intervals are not entirely within each other. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original code's logic:\n\nIf c > b \u2192 no overlap \u2192 0.\n\nElse if a > d \u2192 no overlap \u2192 0.\n\nElse if a < c \u2192 then the overlap starts at c and ends at min(b, d), so the duration is min(b,d) - c.\n\nElse (a >= c). Then, they collect all four points, sort them, and take l.get(2) - l.get(1). Wait, sorted list would be in order. Let's say the sorted list is [x1, x2, x3, x4]. Then the overlap would be x3 - x2. But how does that work?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a=50, c=40, so the intervals are [50, b] and [40, d]. The overlapping part would start at 50 and end at min(b, d). But according to the code, when a >= c, but after sorting, the four points are 40, 50, ... So the sorted list would have x1=40, x2=50, x3= ... suppose b=70 and d=60. Then sorted list is 40,50,60,70. Then l.get(2) is 60, l.get(1) is 50. So 60-50=10. Which is indeed the overlap between [50,70] and [40,60], which is 10. So that works. Similarly, if a=30, c=20, but the previous conditions may have covered that. So the code is handling the general case by sorting all four points and taking the middle two. So in Fortran, I need to create an array of these four values, sort them, then compute the difference between the third and second elements. \n\nSo, in Fortran, how to sort an array? Fortran has built-in functions for sorting, but perhaps I can use a simple bubble sort for four elements. Alternatively, write a small subroutine to sort the array. Let's see. The original code sorts the list and takes elements at indices 1 and 2 (since Java's list is 0-based, l.get(2) is the third element, l.get(1) is the second). Wait, no: in Java, the code adds a, b, c, d. Then sorts them. So after sorting, the order is ascending. Then l.get(2) is the third element (since indexes are 0-based). So for example, sorted list [10,20,30,40], then indices 0,1,2,3. So l.get(1) is 20, l.get(2) is 30. So the difference is 30-20=10. So in the Fortran code, after sorting the array in ascending order, the third element (index 3 if using 1-based?) Wait, no. Fortran arrays are usually 1-based. So if we have a list with four elements, sorted in ascending order, then the third element is the third in 1-based indexing. So for example, sorted array [10, 20, 30, 40], then element 2 is 20, element 3 is 30, so the difference is 30-20=10. So the code would be sorted_list(3) - sorted_list(2).\n\nSo in Fortran, how to sort an array. Let's create an array of four elements, then sort them. Let's write a simple subroutine to sort the array. For four elements, a simple bubble sort would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function sort. Wait, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. So we need to implement a sorting algorithm. Let's create a subroutine that sorts the array in ascending order.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCheck if c > b \u2192 output 0.\n\nElse if a > d \u2192 output 0.\n\nElse if a < c \u2192 output min(b, d) - c.\n\nElse \u2192 sort the array of a, b, c, d, then compute the difference between the third and second elements in the sorted array.\n\nWait, wait, the original code's else case is when a >= c, but after the previous conditions. Let me see:\n\nThe code's first condition is if (c > b) \u2192 no overlap.\n\nElse if (a > d) \u2192 no overlap.\n\nElse if (a < c) \u2192 overlap starts at c.\n\nElse \u2192 when a >= c and the previous conditions are not met. So the intervals must overlap here. Then, the code sorts the four numbers and takes the third element minus the second. So for example, if the intervals are [a, b] and [c, d], and a >= c, but the other conditions are not met (so c <= b and a <= d). So the overlapping region is from a to min(b, d). Wait, but why does the code then sort all four values and take the middle two?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that when the two intervals are overlapping but one starts after the other, the overlapping region is from the second element to the third element in the sorted list of all four points. For example, a=50, c=40, b=70, d=60. Then sorted points are 40,50,60,70. The overlapping region is 50 to 60. So 60-50=10. Which is correct. Another example: a=30, c=20, b=50, d=40. Then sorted is 20,30,40,50. The overlapping region is 30 to 40, which is 10. So the code is correct here. So the logic in the else clause is to collect all four points, sort them, and the overlapping time is the third element minus the second.\n\nSo in Fortran, when we reach the else clause, we need to create an array with a, b, c, d, sort it, then compute the third element minus the second.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCheck the conditions in order.\n\nIf any of the first two conditions, output 0.\n\nElse if a < c, compute min(b, d) - c.\n\nElse, sort the four values and compute the third minus the second.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the else clause is when the previous conditions are not met. So after checking c <= b and a <= d, and a >= c. So in that case, the intervals overlap in the middle. So sorting the four values and taking the middle two gives the overlapping region.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading a, b, c, d.\n\nWe need to handle the conditions:\n\nif (c > b .or. a > d) then\n    print *, 0\nelse if (a < c) then\n    res = min(b, d) - c\n    print *, res\nelse\n    ! create array with a, b, c, d\n    ! sort array\n    ! compute sorted(3) - sorted(2)\n    ! print the result\nend if\n\nSo the main part is the else clause where we need to sort the four elements.\n\nImplementing the sorting in Fortran:\n\nLet's create an integer array of size 4:\n\ninteger :: arr(4)\narr = [a, b, c, d]\n\nThen sort arr in ascending order.\n\nTo sort the array, perhaps implement a simple bubble sort for 4 elements.\n\nAlternatively, write a generic sorting subroutine.\n\nHere's a bubble sort implementation for a small array:\n\nsubroutine sort(arr)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer :: i, j, temp\n    do i = 1, size(arr)-1\n        do j = 1, size(arr)-i\n            if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                temp = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                arr(j+1) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend subroutine sort\n\nBut in this case, since the array is of size 4, it's manageable.\n\nOnce the array is sorted, the third element (index 3 in 1-based) minus the second (index 2) gives the result.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram ABC070_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a, b, c, d, res\n    integer :: arr(4)\n    read(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\n    if (c > b .or. a > d) then\n        res = 0\n    else if (a < c) then\n        res = min(b, d) - c\n    else\n        arr = [a, b, c, d]\n        call sort(arr)\n        res = arr(3) - arr(2)\n    end if\n\n    print *, res\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine sort(arr)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer :: i, j, temp, n\n        n = size(arr)\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            do j = 1, n-i\n                if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                    temp = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                    arr(j+1) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort\n\nend program ABC070_B\n\nBut wait, in the else clause, after checking a < c is false, which implies a >= c. But let's see the conditions:\n\nThe else clause is executed when:\n\nc <= b (since first condition is c> b \u2192 no overlap)\n\na <= d (since second condition is a> d \u2192 no overlap)\n\nand a >= c (since else if is a < c, and this is the else part)\n\nSo in that case, the intervals are overlapping in some way. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nTesting some examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 1 3 2 4 \u2192 a=1, b=3, c=2, d=4.\n\nCheck if c > b \u2192 2 >3? No.\n\nCheck a >d \u2192 1>4? No.\n\nCheck a < c \u2192 1 <2 \u2192 yes. So res = min(3,4) -2 \u21923-2=1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nWhich is correct as overlap is from 2 to3.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInput: 2 4 1 3 \u2192 a=2, b=4, c=1, d=3.\n\nCheck c> b \u21921>4? No.\n\na> d \u21922>3? No.\n\na <c \u21922 <1? No. So enter else.\n\narr is [2,4,1,3]. After sorting:1,2,3,4. Then arr(3)-arr(2) =3-2=1. The overlapping region is 2-3, which is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example where a >=c and the intervals overlap:\n\nInput: a=5, b=10, c=3, d=7.\n\nCheck c <=b \u21923 <=10 \u2192 yes.\n\na <=d \u21925 <=7 \u2192 yes.\n\na >=c \u21925 >=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo else clause.\n\narr is [5,10,3,7]. Sorted \u21923,5,7,10. arr(3)-arr(2)=7-5=2. Overlap is from5 to7, which is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example where a >=c but the intervals are [5, 10] and [3, 15]. Then sorted array is 3,5,10,15. arr(3)-arr(2) =10-5=5. Overlap is 5-10 \u21925. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the input. The Java code reads the four integers from input. In Fortran, read(*,*) a, b, c, d.\n\nNow, the code should be written as a Fortran program.\n\nPotential issues: the sort subroutine is inside the program with contains. That's valid in Fortran. The main program and the subroutine are in the same file.\n\nSo the code should be as written above.\n\nNow, let me check if the code handles all cases.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: a=10, b=20, c=30, d=40. Then c=30 >b=20 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nInput: a=40, b=50, c=10, d=30 \u2192 a>d (40>30) \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nEdge case where a=c. For example:\n\na=5, b=10, c=5, d=7. Then a >=c \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck conditions: c=5 <=b=10 \u2192 yes. a=5 <=d=7 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo else clause. sorted array is [5,5,7,10]. arr(3)-arr(2) =7-5=2. The overlap is from5 to7, which is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case where the intervals are the same. a=5, b=10, c=5, d=10. Then sorted array is [5,5,10,10]. arr(3)-arr(2) =10-5=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written."
