So the code returns the first index where the sum is >= q. So in Fortran, the function should return the same index, but adjusted for 1-based. So in the example, the index would be 3 (since 6 is at index 3 in 1-based). So the Fortran code's function would return 3, and the output is 3.

Yes, which is the same as (i+j)/2 when i=1, j=4 \u2192 (1+4)/2=2.5 \u2192 2, same result. But in code, using i + (j-i)/2 is the same as (i +j)/2.

But since Fortran uses integer division, (i + j) must be even. For example, i=3, j=4: (3+4)/2=3.5 \u21923 in integer division. So the code can be written as md = (i + j)/2. So the function can be adjusted. But in the code example I wrote earlier, the function uses md = i + (j-i)/2. Which is equivalent. So both approaches are possible. But perhaps the original code uses the first method to avoid integer overflow, but in Fortran, integer overflow is not a concern for small n. So now, the code is almost correct.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an array of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the previous elements. Then, for each query, it finds the smallest index where the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to the query value using a binary search.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of Fortran code. Fortran uses subroutines and functions, and I'll need to handle input/output similarly. \n\nIn the Java code, the main method reads 'n' and then reads 'n' integers into an array, where each element is the sum of the previous. So in Fortran, I'll read 'n', then read the first element. Then for each subsequent element, I read a value and add it to the previous sum. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the Java code reads 'm' queries. Each query is processed by the 'fun' function, which is a binary search. The function returns the index where the cumulative sum meets the condition, and then they print that index plus one (since Java uses 0-based indices and the problem might expect 1-based).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the original Java code uses 0-based. So I need to adjust indices accordingly. Let's see: when the Java code has arr[md], in Fortran, if we make the array 1-based, md would need to be adjusted. Wait, but maybe it's easier to keep the Fortran array 1-based. Let's think.\n\nThe initial Java array starts at 0. The first element is arr[0], then each next element is the sum. So in Fortran, arr(1) = first element, arr(2) = first + second, etc. Then, the binary search would look for the first index where arr(md) >= q. But in Fortran, the indices start at 1, so when translating the binary search, the loop variables and indices need to be adjusted.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n, then read the first element for arr(1). Then for i from 2 to n, read x and set arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x. Wait, wait. Wait the Java code does this:\n\narr[0] = sc.nextInt();\nfor (i=1 to n-1) { x=sc...; arr[i] = x + arr[i-1]; }\n\nSo in Fortran, arr(1) is the first input. Then for i from 2 to n, each arr(i) is arr(i-1) + new input. So yes.\n\nThen read m, then read m queries into an array q.\n\nFor each query in q, perform the binary search and output the result +1 (since Java is 0-based, but the output adds 1. Wait, in the Java code, the function returns the index, which is 0-based. Then the print adds 1, making it 1-based. So in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, the result would directly be the 1-based index. Wait, but let's see.\n\nWait, the original Java code's 'fun' function returns the index where arr[md] >= q, using 0-based indices. For example, if the first element is 5, and q is 3, the function returns 0, then adds 1. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the same logic would return 1, and no need to add 1. Wait, but the Java code returns the index in 0-based and then adds 1. So the output is 1-based. Therefore, in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the binary search returns the 1-based index, so the output is that index. Wait, but maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose in Java, the array is [1, 3, 6, 10]. So for q=4, the first element >=4 is 3 (index 1?), wait no. Wait, the array in Java is cumulative sums. So if the input numbers are 1, 2, 3,4, then the cumulative array is 1, 3,6,10. So for q=4, the first element >=4 is 3 (index 2 in 0-based, which is 3 in 1-based). The Java code's binary search would return index 2 (0-based), then add 1, so output 3. If Fortran uses 1-based, then the binary search would return index 3 directly, and the output would be 3. So the code in Fortran would not need to add 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait the Java code returns the index in the array (0-based), and then adds 1 to make it 1-based. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the binary search's result would already be the 1-based index, so when outputting, we don't add 1. So the 'fun' function in Java returns the 0-based index, which is then made 1-based. The Fortran function should return the 1-based index, so no addition.\n\nSo the key is to adjust the binary search to work with 1-based indices.\n\nLet me think about the 'fun' function in Java. The binary search variables are i and j, starting at 0 and n-1 (since j is set to n initially, but then in the code, the array is of size n. Wait, no. Wait in Java, the array is of size n. So arr has indices 0 to n-1. So when the code initializes j to n, but then in the first iteration, j is set to n-1. Because when i=0 and j=n, then md is 0 + (n - 0)/2 = n/2. But arr[md] would be invalid if n is the array size, which starts at 0. Wait, maybe the initial code has a mistake here. Let's check.\n\nIn Java code:\n\nstatic int fun(int arr[], int q, int n, int m) {\n    int res = 0;\n    int i = 0, j = n;\n    while (i <= j) {\n        int md = i + (j - i)/2;\n        if (arr[md] == q) return md;\n        else if (arr[md] > q) {\n            res = md;\n            j = md - 1;\n        } else i = md + 1;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nWait, wait, the array arr has length n. So the valid indices are 0 to n-1. But in the code, j is initialized to n. Then md could be up to (i=0, j=n) md=0 + (n-0)/2 = n/2. If n is the array length, then arr[md] would be arr[n/2], which is okay if n is at least 1. But wait, in the code, when j is initialized to n, but arr is size n. So in Java, arr has elements 0..n-1, so when j is set to n, which is beyond the array's last index. That seems like a possible error. Wait, but maybe the code is correct because when the binary search is done, j gets adjusted. Let me see.\n\nFor example, in the first iteration, when j is n, but the array's maximum index is n-1. Then md could be (0 + n)/2. Let's say n is 5. Then j is 5, md is 2 (since (5-0)/2 is 2.5, but integer division gives 2). Then arr[2] is checked. Then if arr[2] < q, i becomes 3. Then next iteration, i=3, j=5. md is 3 + (5-3)/2 = 3+1=4. Then arr[4] is checked. Then, if arr[4] < q, i becomes 5. Then i=5, j=5, md=5. Then arr[5] is accessed, which is out of bounds (since the array is 0..4). Oh, so this code has a bug. Because when j is set to n, which is equal to the array length. So arr has indices up to n-1, so when j is n, then md can be up to (i + j)/2, which can be n. For example, if i is 5 and j is 5 (array size 5, indices 0-4), then md is 5, and arr[5] is out of bounds.\n\nSo that's a problem. So the initial Java code has an error here. But perhaps the code is correct because the problem's test cases avoid this. Hmm. Well, maybe the code is intended to have j initialized to n-1. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the code is part of a programming competition solution. So perhaps the problem's input ensures that the queries are such that the binary search does not go out of bounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with j = n-1. Let me see. The original code's main function:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nint arr[] = new int[n];\narr[0] = sc.nextInt();\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++) { ... }\n\nSo the array has n elements. So indices 0 to n-1.\n\nIn the 'fun' function, j is initialized to n. Which would allow md up to n. But that would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when q is larger than the maximum element of arr. For example, if arr is [1,3,6,10], then if q is 15, the code would check md values up to j = 4 (since n=4), which is invalid. So in that case, when i=0 and j=4 (n=4), the md would be 2. Then arr[2] is 6 <15, so i=3. Then next md is 3+ (4-3)/2 = 3+0=3. arr[3] is 10 <15. i becomes 4. Then loop checks i<=j (4 <=4). md=4+0=4. arr[4] is invalid. So the code will crash.\n\nHmm. So the original Java code has a bug here. But perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that q is not larger than the maximum in arr. Or perhaps the code is supposed to return the last index in that case. So maybe the code is incorrect, but I need to replicate it in Fortran. So regardless, in the Fortran translation, I need to handle the same logic.\n\nBut how to handle it. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So the valid indices are 1 to n. The initial j in Java is n (array length). So in Fortran, j would be set to n+1? Or no. Wait, in the Java code, the array is of size n. So in Fortran, the array is of size n, indices 1 to n. So the binary search needs to be adjusted.\n\nLet me rework the binary search for Fortran.\n\nIn the Java code, the binary search starts with i=0 and j=n. But since the array has indices 0 to n-1, j is n-1. Wait, but the code in Java uses j=n. Which is incorrect. So perhaps the original code's j is supposed to be n-1. But let's assume that the code works as written, and the user's problem passes test cases where q is within the array's maximum.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, of size n. So the binary search needs to start with i=1 and j=n. Then, md is (i + j) / 2. Then compare arr(md) with q.\n\nBut let's see. Let's adjust the binary search code.\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\ni = 0, j = n\n\nLoop while i <= j:\n\nmd = i + (j -i)/2 \u2192 same as (i +j)/2.\n\nif arr[md] == q \u2192 return md.\n\nElse if arr[md] > q \u2192 set res=md, j=md-1.\n\nElse \u2192 i=md+1.\n\nSo in Fortran, when the array is 1-based, and the indices are 1 to n.\n\nSo, for the same logic, the initial i would be 1, j is n.\n\nWait, no. Because the Java code starts with i=0 and j=n, which is beyond the array's maximum index. So in Fortran, perhaps the code should start with i=1 and j=n+1? Or adjust the initial j.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's intention. The binary search is trying to find the first index where the array is >= q. So if all elements are < q, then the result would be n. But in Java's code, when j is initialized to n, which is beyond the array's bounds. So perhaps the code works because the array is a cumulative sum, and the queries are within the maximum sum. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct. Let's see an example.\n\nSuppose arr is [1, 3, 6, 10]. n=4.\n\nq=5.\n\nIn the Java code, the binary search starts with i=0, j=4.\n\nmd = (0+4)/2=2. arr[2] is 6>5 \u2192 res=2, j=1.\n\nNext loop i=0, j=1. md=0 + (1-0)/2=0.5 \u2192 0. arr[0]=1 <5 \u2192 i=1.\n\nNow i=1, j=1. md=1. arr[1]=3 <5 \u2192 i=2. Now i=2>j=1 \u2192 loop ends. return res=2 (index 2). So output is 2+1=3.\n\nWhich is correct, as 3 is the index where 6 is >=5.\n\nSo the code works in this case. But if q is 11, then the code would go out of bounds. So the code assumes that queries are <= the last element of arr.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's constraints guarantee that all queries are within the cumulative sum array's values. So for the Fortran code, we need to replicate this.\n\nSo in Fortran, the binary search will be adjusted for 1-based indices.\n\nSo, the Fortran function would look like:\n\nfunction fun(arr, q, n, m) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(n), q, n, m\n    integer :: res, i, j, md\n\n    res = 1\n    i = 1\n    j = n\n    do while (i <= j)\n        md = i + (j - i)/2  ! same as (i +j)/2 using integer division\n        if (arr(md) == q) then\n            res = md\n            return\n        else if (arr(md) > q) then\n            res = md\n            j = md - 1\n        else\n            i = md + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend function\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the initial res is 0. But in Fortran, the initial res is 1. Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, when the loop exits, res is the last md where arr[md] > q. So in the Fortran code, the initial res should be set to 1 (since it's 1-based). But let's think.\n\nIf all elements are < q, then the code would return the initial res, which in Java is 0, but in Fortran is 1. But that's incorrect. Wait, no. Because in Java, the initial res is 0. Then, during the loop, whenever arr[md] > q, res is updated to md. So if all elements are less than q, the res remains 0. But that would return 0, which is not a valid index. So perhaps the code is incorrect in Java, but perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that q is not larger than the last element.\n\nBut in the problem statement (codeforces 474 B), the queries are the positions of the worms, and the array is the cumulative sum. So each query must be between 1 and the total sum. So the code may not handle q larger than the sum. But in the problem, that's impossible.\n\nAssuming that, the code in Fortran would need to start with res=1, and during the binary search, whenever arr(md) > q, set res=md and continue. So the code would find the first index where arr(md) >= q.\n\nBut in Java, the code returns the first index where arr[md] >= q, but the way the binary search is structured, it's possible that res is the index where it's the first such.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The binary search in the Java code is looking for the first occurrence where arr[md] >= q. Because when arr[md] is larger than q, the code moves j to md-1 to check if there's a smaller index. If not, res is set to md. So the res is the first index where arr[md] >= q.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1,3,6,10], q=4. Then the binary search steps:\n\ni=0, j=4.\n\nmd = 2 (0 + (4-0)/2). arr[2] is 6>4 \u2192 res=2, j=1.\n\nNext iteration i=0, j=1. md=0+ (1-0)/2=0. arr[0]=1 <4 \u2192 i=1.\n\nNow i=1, j=1. md=1. arr[1] =3 <4 \u2192 i=2. Loop ends. So return res=2. Then output 2+1=3. Which is correct as arr[2]=6 >=4.\n\nSo the code returns the first index where the sum is >= q. So in Fortran, the function should return the same index, but adjusted for 1-based. So in the example, the index would be 3 (since 6 is at index 3 in 1-based). So the Fortran code's function would return 3, and the output is 3.\n\nSo the binary search in Fortran would be:\n\nInitialize i=1, j=n.\n\nres =1.\n\nThen proceed similarly.\n\nLet's see for the example where arr is [1,3,6,10], q=4.\n\ni=1, j=4.\n\nmd= (1+4)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 (integer division). arr(2)=3 <4 \u2192 i=3.\n\nNext iteration: i=3, j=4. md=(3+4)/2=3.5 \u21923. arr(3)=6 >=4. So res=3, j=2.\n\nNow i=3, j=2 \u2192 loop ends. Return res=3. So output is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: q=5.\n\ni=1, j=4.\n\nmd=2. arr(2)=3 <5 \u2192 i=3.\n\nmd=(3+4)/2=3.5 \u21923. arr(3)=6 >=5 \u2192 res=3, j=2. Loop ends. Return 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the binary search in Fortran is adjusted to 1-based indices.\n\nNow, the main program.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to read the inputs. Let's outline the steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the first element as arr(1).\n\nThen for i from 2 to n, read x, and set arr(i) = arr(i-1)+x.\n\nThen read m.\n\nRead m elements into q array.\n\nFor each q element, call fun and print the result.\n\nBut in Fortran, the function needs to be declared. Also, Fortran requires explicit interfaces for functions, but in a simple program, perhaps we can avoid that.\n\nBut for code correctness, perhaps using a function with an explicit interface is better. But for simplicity, let's proceed.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, x\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:), q(:)\n    integer :: fun\n\n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    read(*,*) arr(1)\n    do i = 2, n\n        read(*,*) x\n        arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x\n    end do\n\n    ! Read m and queries\n    read(*,*) m\n    allocate(q(m))\n    do i = 1, m\n        read(*,*) q(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Process queries\n    do i = 1, m\n        write(*,*) fun(arr, q(i), n, m)\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(arr, q)\nend program main\n\nfunction fun(arr, q, n, m) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(n), q, n, m\n    integer :: res, i, j, md\n\n    res = 1\n    i = 1\n    j = n\n    do while (i <= j)\n        md = i + (j - i)/2\n        if (arr(md) == q) then\n            res = md\n            return\n        else if (arr(md) > q) then\n            res = md\n            j = md - 1\n        else\n            i = md + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend function fun\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but when using (j -i)/2, since j and i are integers, j-i is integer. So (j -i)/2 is integer division.\n\nBut md = i + (j-i)/2. So for example, i=1, j=4: (4-1)/2=1.5 \u21921. So md=1+1=2.\n\nYes, which is the same as (i+j)/2 when i=1, j=4 \u2192 (1+4)/2=2.5 \u2192 2, same result.\n\nBut in code, using i + (j-i)/2 is the same as (i +j)/2. So perhaps in Fortran, we can just write md = (i +j)/2.\n\nBut the original Java code uses md = i + (j -i)/2 which is equivalent to (i + j)/2. So in Fortran, we can compute md as (i + j)/2.\n\nBut since Fortran uses integer division, (i + j) must be even. For example, i=3, j=4: (3+4)/2=3.5 \u21923 in integer division.\n\nSo the code can be written as md = (i + j)/2.\n\nSo the function can be adjusted.\n\nBut in the code example I wrote earlier, the function uses md = i + (j-i)/2. Which is equivalent. So both approaches are possible.\n\nBut perhaps the original code uses the first method to avoid integer overflow, but in Fortran, integer overflow is not a concern for small n.\n\nSo now, the code is almost correct. But in Fortran, function parameters are passed with intent, and the function needs to be properly declared.\n\nBut in the main program, the function 'fun' is declared as integer. However, in Fortran, the function's return type can be declared via the function statement. So the code should be correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the function is accessible. In the main program, after 'implicit none', the function 'fun' is declared as integer, but in Fortran, functions that return an integer need to have their return type specified. So perhaps the code should have an interface block.\n\nBut for simplicity, maybe we can avoid that. Let's test.\n\nBut when the function is defined after the main program, and the main program uses implicit none, then the compiler may not know the function's interface. So this can cause errors. Therefore, to avoid this, the function should be placed before the main program, or an interface block should be provided.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the 'contains' keyword can be used to include the function within the main program's scope, which makes the interface known.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, x\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:), q(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    read(*,*) arr(1)\n    do i = 2, n\n        read(*,*) x\n        arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x\n    end do\n\n    read(*,*) m\n    allocate(q(m))\n    do i = 1, m\n        read(*,*) q(i)\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, m\n        write(*,*) binary_search(arr, q(i), n)\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(arr, q)\ncontains\n    integer function binary_search(arr, q, n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: arr(n), q, n\n        integer :: low, high, mid\n\n        low = 1\n        high = n\n        binary_search = n  ! Default to the last element if all are less than q\n\n        do while (low <= high)\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            if (arr(mid) == q) then\n                binary_search = mid\n                return\n            else if (arr(mid) > q) then\n                binary_search = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else\n                low = mid + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n    end function binary_search\nend program main\n\nWait, this way, the function is inside the main program, and the interface is known.\n\nAlso, I renamed 'fun' to 'binary_search' for clarity.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the function 'fun' returns 'res', which is initialized to 0. But in the Fortran code, the initial res is set to 1, but in the code above, the default is set to n. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, binary_search is initialized to n. But in the Java code, res is initialized to 0, which is 0-based, so in 1-based, it would be 1. But the code may need to adjust.\n\nWait, the original Java code initializes res =0, and then during the loop, if any element is > q, res is set to md. So the initial res is 0 (invalid in 0-based array), but during the first iteration, if the md element is > q, res is set to md, which is valid. So in Fortran, the initial res should be set to 1, perhaps. But let's see.\n\nIn the code above, the binary_search function is initialized to n. Let's see with an example.\n\nSuppose q is 1. The array is [1,3,6,10]. The first mid is (1+4)/2=2. arr(2)=3>1 \u2192 res=2, high=1. Next mid is (1+1)/2=1. arr(1)=1==q \u2192 return 1. So the code returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: q=2. The array is [1,3,6,10]. mid=2 \u21923>2 \u2192res=2, high=1. Then mid=1 \u2192 arr(1)=1 <2 \u2192 low=2. Loop ends. Return res=2. So output is 2. Correct, since arr(2)=3 is the first >=2.\n\nSo initializing res to 1 may be better. Because if no elements are found, but according to the problem constraints, this can't happen.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code above, the binary_search is initialized to n, which is the maximum possible index. So if all elements are less than q, it returns n. But according to the problem's constraints, this can't happen. But the problem's code may require that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut let's re-examine the Java code's binary search.\n\nIn Java code, the initial res is 0. Then, during the loop, whenever arr[md] > q, res is updated to md, and j is adjusted. So the res keeps track of the last md where arr[md] > q. So even if the loop exits without finding an exact match, res is the first index where arr[md] > q.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the function initializes res to mid when arr(md) > q. So it should work similarly.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code above, the 'binary_search' function is initialized to n, but during the loop, whenever a md is found where arr(md) > q, the binary_search is set to md, and high is adjusted. So the code should find the first md where arr(md) >= q. But in the case where no exact match is found, the code returns the first index where arr(md) > q.\n\nBut the Java code returns res, which is the last md where arr(md) > q. Wait, no. For example, let's say the array is [1,3,5,7], and q=4. The binary search steps:\n\ni=0, j=4.\n\nmd=2 (arr[2]=3 <4 \u2192i=3.\n\nmd=3 (i=3, j=4). arr[3]=5>4 \u2192res=3, j=2. Loop ends. return 3. So output is 3+1=4.\n\nBut the correct answer is index 3 (5 >=4) in 1-based, which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the function would return 3 (1-based) for q=4. So the code would output 3, which is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: q=10. The array is [1,3,6,10]. The Java code would return 3 (index 3 in 0-based), then +1=4. The Fortran code would return 4 (1-based) directly.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as follows."
