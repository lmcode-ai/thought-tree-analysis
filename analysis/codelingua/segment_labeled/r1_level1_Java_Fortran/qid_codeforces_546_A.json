The main method reads three long integers: pandu, vundu, urdu. Then it calculates the sum of i*pandu for i from 1 to urdu. If the sum c is less than vundu, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints c - vundu.\n\nFirst, let me note the variables. In Java, they're using long, which in Fortran would be integer with kind=8, maybe.

Compute the cumulative sum c = pandu * (1 + 2 + ... + urdu) = pandu * urdu*(urdu+1)/2. Wait, wait, the original code loops from 1 to urdu and adds i*pandu each time. That's equivalent to pandu multiplied by the sum of 1 to urdu. Sum of 1 to urdu is urdu*(urdu+1)/2. But the original code uses a loop. However, for Fortran, perhaps writing a loop is straightforward.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading inputs is a bit different. Java uses Scanner.nextLong(), but Fortran uses read statements with format specifiers. But since the user inputs are integers, we can read them as such.\n\nVariables in Fortran need to be declared. So variables pandu, vundu, urdu, and c should be declared as integers.\n\nWait, in Java, the variables are of type long. So in Fortran, they should be integer(kind=8) to handle large integers.\n\nSo first, declare variables:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, i\n\nThen, read the input.
