  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main part is counting the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of each input number. Then, for each count, they calculate some sum and accumulate it. \n\nFirst, looking at the Java code: the rec function takes a long x and counts how many bits are set. It loops from k=31 down to 0, checks if the k-th bit is set. Wait, but a long in Java is 64 bits. Wait, the original code uses rec(sc.nextInt()), but nextInt() returns an integer. Wait, the input is an integer, which is 32 bits. So the rec function is checking bits from 31 to 0, which is correct for a 32-bit integer. But in Java, the parameter is long x. Wait, but when you pass an int to a long, it's promoted. So rec is counting the number of bits in the integer's two's complement representation. For example, if x is a positive integer, leading bits are zero. So the rec function correctly counts the number of set bits in the 32-bit representation. \n\nSo the Fortran code needs a function that, given an integer, returns the number of set bits. Then, for each input number, compute that count, and increment the corresponding index in an array a of size 33. Then, for each element in a, calculate sum = (1 + a[i]-1)/2.0 * (a[i]-1). Wait, wait, that formula simplifies to (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2. Because (1 + (a[i]-1)) is a[i], divided by 2, multiplied by (a[i]-1). So (a[i] * (a[i]-1)) / 2. So the sum is the combination of a[i] choose 2. Because when you have a[i] elements, the number of pairs is a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2. So the answer is the sum of all such combinations for each bit count.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n integers.\n2. For each integer, compute the number of set bits (rec function).\n3. Increment the count in the array a for that bit count.\n4. Sum all combinations of a[i] choose 2 for each a[i], which is a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling input. The Java code uses a FastReader class for faster input. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using read statements. But for multiple integers on the same line, need to parse them. However, the code reads each number via nextInt(), which handles each number as a separate input. So in the main program, we read n, then read n integers. Each integer is processed by the bit counting function.\n\nIn Fortran, how to read the input? Let's assume that each integer is on a separate line. But the original Java code can handle numbers separated by any whitespace. In practice, when the user inputs n numbers, they might be on one line or multiple lines. Fortran's read can handle this as long as the input is correctly formatted. So for the code, read n, then read the next n integers.\n\nBut perhaps the original Java code uses the FastReader which reads tokens. So in Fortran, perhaps read the entire line, split into tokens. Hmm, but that's more complex. Alternatively, since Fortran's list-directed input (using *) will read all available numbers, perhaps we can read the numbers in a loop. For example:\n\nread(*,*) n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) num\n    cnt = rec(num)\n    a(cnt+1) = a(cnt+1) + 1  ! assuming a is 1-based?\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based by default. The Java code has a[33], indexes 0-32. So in Fortran, we need an array from 0 to 32. Or adjust the indices. Let's think. The rec function returns the number of bits, which for 32-bit integers can range from 0 to 32. So a in Java is of size 33 (indices 0-32). In Fortran, we can declare a(0:32) and initialize to 0.\n\nThen, for each number, compute the bit count, increment a(bit_count).\n\nSo the rec function in Fortran. How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer. Let's think. In Java, the code checks for each bit from 31 down to 0. So for a given x, shift right k bits and check if the least significant bit is 1.\n\nIn Fortran, integers are signed, but using bit operations, perhaps using the ibits function, or using shift and bit checking.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the bit_size function returns the number of bits for the type. For example, for integer(4), it's 32 bits. So for a 32-bit integer, the bits are 0 to 31. So for a given integer x, loop from k=0 to 31, check if the bit is set.\n\nWait, but the original code loops from k=31 down to 0. But the order doesn't matter for counting the number of bits. So in Fortran, the rec function can loop from k=0 to 31, and count how many times (ibits(x, k, 1) is 1. Alternatively, use bit checking.\n\nSo the Fortran function rec could be written as a function that takes an integer and returns the count.\n\nAlternatively, using the popcnt intrinsic function. Wait, some Fortran compilers support popcnt as an intrinsic, which returns the number of set bits. But this might not be portable. Since the original code uses a manual approach, perhaps better to implement the same method.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nfunction rec(x) result(answer)\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer :: answer, k\n    answer = 0\n    do k = 0, 31\n        if (btest(x, k)) answer = answer + 1\n    end do\nend function\n\nWait, because btest checks if the k-th bit is set. For a 32-bit integer, bits 0 (LSB) to 31 (MSB). So looping from 0 to 31 and counting gives the total number of set bits. This should be equivalent to the Java code.\n\nWait, the Java code loops from k=31 down to 0. Each bit is checked with (x & (1 << k)) != 0. So for a 32-bit integer, this checks each bit from the MSB (bit 31) to LSB (bit 0). But the count is the same as looping from 0 to 31. So the order doesn't matter; the count remains the same.\n\nSo the Fortran function can loop from 0 to 31, sum the bits, and return that count.\n\nOnce the count is obtained, the array a is incremented at that index. Since in Java, the array is size 33 (0-32), in Fortran we can declare a(0:32) and initialize to 0.\n\nThen, after processing all numbers, the sum is calculated as the sum of a[i] choose 2 for each i.\n\nIn Java, the code loops through each a[i], and calculates sum += (a[i] * (a[i]-1)) / 2. Because when a[i] is 0 or 1, the term is 0. So in Fortran, we can do the same.\n\nSo in Fortran, after initializing a, loop over i from 0 to 32, compute the sum.\n\nBut in the Java code, the array a has a.length of 33, which is indexes 0-32. So in Fortran, loop from i=0 to 32.\n\nNow, the sum is a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2 for each i. Since a[i] can be up to n (if all numbers have the same bit count). The sum is accumulated as a real number in Java (using double), but in the end, the answer is cast to a long. So perhaps in Fortran, we can compute the sum as an integer, using integer division. But in Java, the code uses (1 + a[i]-1)/2.0 * (a[i]-1) \u2192 which is (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2.0. So if a[i] is 3, 3*2/2 = 3. So the sum is accumulated as a double, then cast to long. Which is equivalent to integer division when the product is even, but allows for truncation when the product is odd. Wait, wait: (a[i]*(a[i]-1)) is always even, since one of two consecutive numbers is even. So the division by 2 is exact, and the sum is an integer. So in Fortran, we can compute it as an integer.\n\nBut in Java code, the variable answer is a double, but when cast to long, it's the integer sum. So perhaps in Fortran, we can use integer arithmetic.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: total\ntotal = 0\ndo i = 0, 32\n    if (a(i) < 2) cycle\n    total = total + a(i) * (a(i)-1) / 2\nend do\nprint *, total\n\nSo this would compute the same sum.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the structure of the Fortran code:\n\n- Declare variables: n, a(0:32), etc.\n- Read n.\n- Read n integers, compute their bit count, increment a(bit_count).\n- Compute the total sum of combinations.\n- Print the total.\n\nNow, handling the input. How to read the n numbers?\n\nIn Java, the code uses a FastReader that parses tokens. So in Fortran, when using read(*,*) num, each read will take the next integer from the input, regardless of line breaks. So the code can read n, then loop n times, each time reading a number.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, num, cnt, total, a(0:32)\n    integer :: rec\n    a = 0\n    read(*,*) n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) num\n        cnt = rec(num)\n        a(cnt) = a(cnt) + 1\n    end do\n    total = 0\n    do i = 0, 32\n        if (a(i) >= 2) then\n            total = total + a(i) * (a(i) - 1) / 2\n        end if\n    end do\n    print '(i0)', total\nend program\n\nfunction rec(x) result(answer)\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer :: answer, k\n    answer = 0\n    do k = 0, 31\n        if (btest(x, k)) answer = answer + 1\n    end do\nend function rec\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have a function inside a program, you need to declare its interface or use a module. Alternatively, put the function after the main program, but then the main program can't see it. Alternatively, use an internal function. But in Fortran, functions can be contained within the program if they are placed after a contains statement.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, num, cnt, total, a(0:32)\n    a = 0\n    read(*,*) n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) num\n        cnt = rec(num)\n        a(cnt) = a(cnt) + 1\n    end do\n    total = 0\n    do i = 0, 32\n        if (a(i) >= 2) then\n            total = total + a(i) * (a(i) - 1) / 2\n        end if\n    end do\n    print '(i0)', total\ncontains\n    integer function rec(x)\n        integer, intent(in) :: x\n        integer :: k\n        rec = 0\n        do k = 0, 31\n            if (btest(x, k)) rec = rec + 1\n        end do\n    end function rec\nend program main\n\nThis should work. But need to test.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n1. Handling negative numbers in the bit count. In Java, the right shift is signed, but in Fortran, the btest function for a negative integer would check the bits as per the two's complement representation. For example, in Java, the code uses (x & (1<<k)) != 0. For negative numbers, the bits are considered as two's complement. In Fortran, the btest function treats the integer as a bit pattern (assuming two's complement), so the count would include the sign bits. For example, -1 in 32 bits would have all bits set, so rec(-1) would return 32. But in Java, the code uses a long x. Wait, the original code's rec function takes a long x. Wait, in Java, when you call rec with an int, it is promoted to long. So the code is checking the lower 32 bits (since 1 << k for k up to 31) of the long. So in Java, the code counts the number of set bits in the lower 32 bits. So for any input integer (even if negative), the code counts the 32 bits (including the sign bits).\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should do the same. Since the input is an integer, which is 32 bits (assuming integer is 4 bytes), and the loop from k=0 to 31, using btest(x, k) would correctly count the set bits, including the sign bits. So this part is equivalent.\n\nAnother possible issue: the Java code uses 1 << k for k up to 31. For a long, 1 << 31 is a valid bit, but when the input is an int, it's promoted to long. So in Java, the code counts the 32 bits (0 to 31) of the integer, treating it as a 32-bit value. So in Fortran, the code correctly does the same.\n\nSo the code should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\nTesting with some examples:\n\nFor example, input of -1 (binary all ones in two's complement) would return 32 bits set. So a[32] would be incremented. Then if there are two such numbers, the combination is 2 choose 2 = 1, contributing to the total sum.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: input 0, which has 0 bits set. So a[0] is incremented.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother point: Fortran's integer may have different sizes. But assuming that the default integer is 4 bytes (32 bits), which is common. If the compiler uses a different size, then the code may need adjustment. But for the problem's purposes, assuming 32-bit integers is okay.\n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code should be as follows."
