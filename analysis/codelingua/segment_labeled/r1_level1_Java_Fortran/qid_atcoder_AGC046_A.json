  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The main part is reading an integer x, then performing some loop to calculate the count. The loop adds tmp (which is the original x) to x each iteration. If x exceeds 360, subtract 360. The count increments each loop until x equals 360. Then output the count.\n\nFortran doesn't have classes like Java, so the FastReader class for input handling needs to be handled differently. In Java, they're using a buffered reader and tokenizer. But in Fortran, I'll just read from standard input using READ statements.\n\nFirst, the main program structure. In Fortran, the program starts with PROGRAM and ends with END PROGRAM. Variables are declared in the declaration section. So variables like x, tmp, count will need to be declared as integers.\n\nThe original code reads x using the FastReader's nextInt. So in Fortran, I can use READ(*,*) x to read from standard input.\n\nThen, the loop. The loop continues until x equals 360. Wait, no, in the Java code, x starts as the input, then tmp is set to x. Then x is set to 0. Then the loop starts: x is increased by tmp each time. If it exceeds 360, subtract 360. Count each iteration.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize count = 0, tmp = x, then set x = 0.\n\nThen do while loop: do while (x .ne. 360)\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx = x + tmp\n\nif x > 360, then x = x - 360\n\ncount = count + 1\n\nWait, but in Java, after adding tmp to x, if x > 360, subtract 360. So it's like x modulo 360, but not exactly. Because if x becomes 400, subtract 360 to get 40. Then next iteration adds tmp again. But the loop continues until x becomes exactly 360.\n\nSo the Fortran code should replicate that logic.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read x from input.\n\n2. Set tmp = x.\n\n3. Set x to 0.\n\n4. Initialize count to 0.\n\n5. Loop while x is not equal to 360:\n\n   a. x = x + tmp\n\n   b. if (x > 360) x = x - 360\n\n   c. count = count + 1\n\n6. After loop, print count.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, after adding tmp to x, they check if it's over 360 and subtract if needed. Then increment count. So even if adding tmp makes x exactly 360, the loop will exit, right?\n\nWait, let's see the Java loop:\n\nInitially x is 0.\n\nLoop while x != 360:\n\nSo first iteration:\n\nx = 0 + tmp.\n\nSuppose tmp is 90. Then x becomes 90. Not 360, so loop again. count is 1.\n\nNext iteration: add 90, x becomes 180. count 2.\n\nThen 270, count 3.\n\nThen 360. Then check x != 360? Now x is 360, so loop exits. So count is 4?\n\nWait, but in Java, after adding tmp, if x > 360, subtract 360. But in the case of 270 + 90 = 360. So x is exactly 360. So no subtraction. Then count increments, then loop condition checks again. Since x is 360 now, loop exits. So the count is incremented once after adding, even if x becomes 360.\n\nSo the count is the number of steps taken to reach exactly 360.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to do the same.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the loop structure is a bit different. The DO WHILE loop checks the condition at the start. But in Java, the loop runs as long as x != 360. So even after adding, if x becomes 360, the loop won't run again.\n\nWait, no. Let's see the Java loop:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nwhile (x != 360) {\n\n   add tmp to x.\n\n   subtract 360 if over.\n\n   count++.\n\n}\n\nSo the loop condition is checked each time before the iteration. So for example, if x is 360 before the loop starts, the loop body is not executed.\n\nWait, initial x is 0. So the first time, loop runs. Let's think of when tmp is 360. Then x becomes 0 + 360 = 360. Then the check is x>360? No. So x is 360. Then count becomes 1. Then loop condition checks x != 360? Now x is 360, so loop exits. So count is 1. Which is correct, because adding 360 once gets to 360.\n\nAnother example: tmp is 180. Steps:\n\nx starts at 0.\n\nLoop runs:\n\nx = 0 + 180 = 180. Count 1. Next loop check x !=360: yes.\n\nLoop again: x +=180 \u2192 360. count 2. Check condition: x is 360 \u2192 loop exits. So count is 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because 180 + 180 = 360. So two steps.\n\nSo the loop in Java runs as long as x is not 360, and each iteration adds tmp, checks if over 360, subtracts if needed, increments count.\n\nIn Fortran, the same logic can be implemented with a DO WHILE loop.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: x, tmp, count\n\n!

So in the code, x is read as the input value, then tmp is set to that x. Then x is reset to 0. Then the loop starts.\n\nYes, that's exactly what the Java code does.\n\nBut wait, the Java code's tmp is the original input x. So if the input is x, then tmp is x. So for example, input x is 90. Then tmp is 90. The loop adds 90 each time.\n\nYes, so the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo the code above should work.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nCase 1: input is 90.\n\nLoop steps:\n\nx starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx = 0 + 90 =90. count 1. 90 !=360 \u2192 loop.\n\nSecond: 90+90=180 \u2192 count2.\n\nThird: 270 \u2192 count3.\n\nFourth: 360 \u2192 count4. Then loop exits. Output is 4. Which is correct, since 90*4=360.\n\nAnother case: input 360.\n\nLoop:\n\nx starts at 0. Add 360 \u2192 x=360. count 1. Then loop condition x=360 \u2192 exit. Output 1.\n\nAnother case: input 1.\n\nThen each iteration adds 1. Then count 360 steps. Because after each addition, x increases by 1, and when it reaches 360, loop stops.\n\nSo code should work.\n\nNow, the Java code uses FastReader for input. But in Fortran, read(*,*) x should handle that. So the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code translates the Java code correctly."
