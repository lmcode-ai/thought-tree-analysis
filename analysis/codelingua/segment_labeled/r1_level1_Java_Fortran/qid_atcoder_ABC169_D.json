  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads a number n, then finds the number of operations needed based on its prime factors. For each prime factor, it counts how many times it divides n, then uses a loop to subtract 1, 2, 3... from the count until it can't anymore, incrementing the answer each time. Finally, if n is still greater than 1 after processing all factors up to sqrt(n), it adds 1 to the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to handle input in Fortran. Java uses Scanner, but Fortran uses READ statements. So I'll read a long integer. Wait, but Fortran's integer kinds can be tricky. Since n can be up to 1e18 (since in Java it's a long), I need to use an 8-byte integer. So declare n as integer(8).\n\nThen, compute the square root. In Java, Math.sqrt(n) returns a double, which is cast to int. In Fortran, sqrt(n) returns a real, so I need to convert it to integer. But since n is an integer(8), maybe using int(sqrt(real(n))) would work. Hmm, but need to be careful with data types.\n\nLoop from i=2 to sqrt. Wait, in Java, the loop runs while i <= sqrt. So in Fortran, the loop variable i would be an integer. So in Fortran, I'll have to loop i from 2 to sqrt_n, where sqrt_n is the integer square root of n. But wait, n might be changing inside the loop. Oh right, in the Java code, after dividing n by i as much as possible, the sqrt is computed once at the beginning. Wait no, wait in the Java code, the sqrt is computed once before the loop. Because even though n is being divided by i, the loop runs up to the initial sqrt(n). Wait, the code is:\n\nint sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);\nfor (int i = 2; i <= sqrt; i++) {\n...\n}\n\nBut after dividing n by i, the sqrt is not updated. So the loop runs up to the initial sqrt of the original n. So that's a point to note. Because, for example, suppose n is 18. The sqrt is 4. So i runs up to 4. But after processing i=2, n becomes 9. Then i=3, which is <=4, and divides 9 into 1. Then i=4 is checked but doesn't divide. Then after the loop, since n is 1, the final check (n>1) is false. So in Fortran, I need to compute the initial sqrt once, not recomputing it each time.\n\nSo first, compute sqrt_n as the integer part of sqrt(n). Then loop i from 2 to sqrt_n.\n\nNext, for each i, count how many times it divides n. Then, for j starting at 1, subtract j from count until count -j >=0. Each time, increment answer.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop for j would need to start at 1, and increment j each time. So perhaps a loop where j increases until count < j. For example, in the Java code, the loop is for (j=1; count -j >=0; j++) { count -=j; answer++; }\n\nSo in Fortran, that's equivalent to:\n\nj = 1\ndo while (count >= j)\n   count = count - j\n   answer = answer + 1\n   j = j + 1\nend do\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThen, after processing all i up to sqrt_n, if n >1, then add 1 to answer.\n\nNow, handling the input. In Fortran, to read a long integer, we can use integer(8) :: n, and read using read(*,*) n.\n\nBut let me check the possible size. The original code uses Java's long, which is 64 bits. So Fortran's integer(8) should handle that.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nLet me structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC169_D\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, i, j, sqrt_n, count, answer\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    answer = 0\n    sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n)))\n\n    do i = 2, sqrt_n\n        count = 0\n        do while (mod(n, i) == 0)\n            n = n / i\n            count = count + 1\n        end do\n        j = 1\n        do while (count >= j)\n            count = count - j\n            answer = answer + 1\n            j = j + 1\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    if (n > 1) then\n        answer = answer + 1\n    end if\n\n    print *, answer\nend program atcoder_ABC169_D\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variable i in the do loop must be an integer, but when sqrt_n is computed as int(sqrt(real(n))), which could be a 4-byte integer. So perhaps better to declare sqrt_n as integer(8) as well. Because if n is very large, the sqrt might exceed the 4-byte integer limit. Wait, Java's code uses int for sqrt, which is 32-bit. So for n up to (2^31 -1)^2, but Java's long is 64 bits, so the sqrt of n (up to 1e18) is 1e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer (max 2e9). So using a 4-byte integer is okay. But in Fortran, when declaring variables, perhaps better to make all variables as integer(8) to avoid issues, except maybe the loop variables. Hmm. Let's think: in Fortran, the loop variable is of type integer, which is default. If sqrt_n is integer(8), then in the loop do i=2, sqrt_n, the loop variable i would be of default kind, which could be 4 bytes. But if sqrt_n is larger than 2^31-1, then i would not reach that. However, in the original Java code, sqrt is an int, so even if n is 1e18, sqrt is 1e9, which is within 4-byte integer. So in Fortran, using integer(4) for sqrt_n and i is okay, but to be safe, perhaps declare all as integer(8).\n\nSo in the declarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, i, sqrt_n, count, answer, j\n\nWait, but the loop variables i and j could be 8 bytes, but in Fortran, the loop variables are of the type they are declared. So it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: when computing sqrt_n, in Java, (int) Math.sqrt(n) truncates towards zero. So in Fortran, using int(sqrt(real(n))) would do the same. But real(n) here is real(kind=4) if real is single precision, which could lose precision for large n. For example, if n is 1e18, real(4) can't represent all integers exactly. So perhaps using real(8) for the sqrt.\n\nSo sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n, 8)), kind=8)\n\nYes, better to cast n to a double precision real, then take sqrt, then convert to integer.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n, 8)), kind=8)\n\nThat would compute the square root as a double precision float, then convert to integer(8), truncating towards zero.\n\nSo adjust the code.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ndo i = 2, sqrt_n\n   ...\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable i is incremented by 1 each time, so this will cover all integers from 2 to sqrt_n, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the loop is for (i=2; i <= sqrt; i++). So the same as Fortran's do i=2, sqrt_n.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, inside the loop, count is initialized to 0. Then, while n mod i is zero, divide n by i and increment count.\n\nThen, for j starting at 1, subtract j from count until possible, incrementing answer each time.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) { ... }\n\nWhich can be written in Fortran as:\n\nj = 1\ndo while (count >= j)\n    count = count -j\n    answer = answer +1\n    j = j +1\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nAfter processing all i's, if n >1, add 1 to answer.\n\nFinally, print the answer.\n\nTesting with some examples. For example, input 24. The prime factors are 2^3 *3^1.\n\nProcessing i=2: count=3. j=1: subtract 1 (count 2, answer 1). j=2: subtract 2 (count 0, answer 2). So total 2. Then i=3: loop up to sqrt(24)=4. So i=3 is 3 <=4. Then count=1. j=1: subtract 1, answer 3. Then i=4: check if divides 24? No. After loop, n is 1. So answer is 3. But original code: wait 24's factors are 2^3 and 3^1. So for 2^3: j=1, subtract 1 (count 2, +1). j=2, subtract 2 (count 0, +1). For 3^1: j=1, subtract 1 (count 0, +1). Then answer is 3. Then since n=1, nothing added. So output is 3. But in the code's example, maybe another case.\n\nAnother example: input 12=2^2*3^1.\n\nProcessing i=2: count=2. j=1: subtract 1 (count1, answer1). j=2: count >=2? 1 <2, loop stops. So answer is 1. Then i=3: sqrt(12)=3. So i=3. count=1. j=1: subtract, answer 2. Then after loop, n=12/(2^2*3^1) = 12/(4*3) =1. So answer is 2. Then since n=1, no. So output is 2. But original code: for 2^2: j=1 (count 1, answer 1). j=2: 1-2 is -1, so no. Then 3^1: answer +1. So total 2. So yes.\n\nNow, translating all into Fortran.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Division in Fortran is integer division. For n = n / i, since in Java it's integer division. So in Fortran, same when n and i are integers. But in Fortran, the division operator for integers is /, which truncates towards zero, same as Java.\n\n- Handling very large n. Since we're using integer(8), which can handle up to 9e18, which is the same as Java's long.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC169_D\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, i, j, sqrt_n, count, answer\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    answer = 0\n    sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n, 8)), kind=8) ! Compute sqrt once as integer\n\n    do i = 2, sqrt_n\n        count = 0\n        do while (mod(n, i) == 0)\n            n = n / i\n            count = count + 1\n        end do\n        j = 1\n        do while (count >= j)\n            count = count - j\n            answer = answer + 1\n            j = j + 1\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    if (n > 1) then\n        answer = answer + 1\n    end if\n\n    print*, answer\nend program atcoder_ABC169_D\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function for integer(8) is mod(n, i), but n and i must be of the same kind. Since both are integer(8), it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: when i is 2, and sqrt_n is up to 1e9, but in Fortran, the loop variable i is declared as integer(8), which can handle that.\n\nTesting for n=1: the loop runs from 2 to sqrt(1)=1, which is 0 iterations. Then check if n>1? No. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2. sqrt_n is 1. So loop from 2 to 1, which is 0 iterations. Then n>1 is true, so answer 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=4. sqrt_n=2. i loops 2. count is 2. j=1: subtract 1 (count 1, answer 1). j=2: subtract 2 (count -1, so no. So answer 1. Then n is 1. So total answer 1.\n\nBut wait, according to the code's logic, for 4=2^2. The count is 2. j starts at 1. Subtract 1 (count 1, answer 1). Next j=2. count >=2? 1 is not >=2. So answer is 1. Then since n is 1, no. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nThe Java code would output 1 in this case.\n\nAnother test case: n=12. As before, answer 2.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should be as written."
