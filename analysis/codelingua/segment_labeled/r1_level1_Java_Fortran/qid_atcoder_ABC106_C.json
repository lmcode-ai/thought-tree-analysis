  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java code reads a string and a long integer k. Then it iterates over the first k characters of the string. For each character, if it's '1', it checks if we're at the k-1 index (since i starts from 0). If so, it prints 1 and exits. If any character is not '1', it prints that character and exits immediately. The loop runs until i < k, so up to the first k characters. But wait, the loop is from i=0 to i<k, which is k iterations. However, the length of the string might be less than k, but in the problem statement, maybe it's guaranteed that the string is long enough? Hmm, maybe in the original problem, the input constraints ensure that the string is long enough, so we don't have to worry about index out of bounds here. But in Fortran, we need to handle that.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to read a string and an integer k. Then, loop through the first k characters of the string. For each character, if it's '1', check if it's the k-th position. Wait, in the Java code, if i is up to k-1, so when k is 3, i is 0,1,2. So the loop runs up to i < k, which is i from 0 to k-1. But in the code, if (i == k-1), then print 1. So that's after checking the first k characters. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < k; i++). So it's iterating k times. But the string has length n. So if the string's length is less than k, then c[i] would cause an array index out of bounds. But perhaps the problem statement says that the input string is such that all positions up to k-1 are valid. Maybe the original problem is such that the string is long enough. For example, if the input is a string of digits, and k is up to 1e18 or something, but the code is designed to check the first k characters. Wait, no. For example, in the code, if the string is shorter than k, then accessing c[i] where i >=n would be an error. So perhaps in the problem, it's guaranteed that the first k characters are all '1's? Or perhaps the code has a bug. But according to the given code, the loop is up to i <k, regardless of the string's length. So in Fortran, we need to handle the case where the string is shorter than k. But in the original code, perhaps the problem constraints ensure that the string's length is at least k? Or maybe the code is wrong. But given that the original code is written that way, I have to replicate the behavior.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop runs for i from 0 to k-1. For each i, check if c[i] is '1'. If not, output c[i] and exit. If it is '1' and we reach i == k-1 (i.e., after k iterations), then output 1. So the logic is: check the first k characters. If all are '1's, then output 1. Otherwise, output the first non-'1' character encountered in the first k characters.\n\nWait no. Let's see:\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to k-1 (since i <k). For each i:\n\nIf c[i] is '1', then check if i == k-1. If yes, print 1 and return. Otherwise, continue the loop.\n\nIf c[i] is not '1', print it and return.\n\nSo the code checks the first k characters. If all the first k characters are '1's, then the loop will run all k times. Then, after the loop, it's done. Wait, no. Wait, the loop runs k times. For each i from 0 to k-1. Let's say k is 3, so i=0,1,2.\n\nIf all three are '1's:\n\n- i=0: '1', check if i ==2 (k-1=3-1=2?), no. So continue.\n- i=1: '1', check if i==2? No.\n- i=2: '1', check if i ==2? Yes. Print 1 and return.\n\nSo in that case, the code correctly outputs 1.\n\nIf any of the first k characters is not '1', the code outputs that character and exits.\n\nSo the code is looking for the first occurrence of a non-'1' in the first k characters. If all are '1's, then output '1'.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to do the same.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to read a string and a long integer.\n\nIn Fortran, the integer kind for 64-bit can be specified with selected_int_kind, but perhaps the problem expects k to be a 64-bit integer, so in Fortran, using integer(kind=8) or something. But in the code, the Java code uses nextLong(), which is 64-bit.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to read a string and a long integer.\n\nThen, loop over the first k characters (but wait, if the string is shorter than k, then the loop would go up to the string's length? But in the original code, the loop runs up to k-1, which may be beyond the string's length. So that's a problem. But perhaps the problem ensures that the input string is such that the first k characters are available.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the string is shorter than k, then accessing characters beyond its length would cause an error.\n\nBut in the Java code, it's possible that the string's length is less than k, which would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But perhaps the original code is written under the assumption that the input is such that the string is long enough. So for the translation, we can proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo steps for Fortran code:\n\n1. Read the input string and the integer k.\n\n2. Loop over the first k characters (indices from 1 to k in Fortran, since Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default).\n\nWait, Java uses 0-based, so the first character is c[0], which is index 1 in Fortran.\n\nSo in the loop, for i from 1 to k (Fortran indices), check if the character at position i is '1'.\n\nIf any character is not '1', output it and stop.\n\nIf all the first k characters are '1', output '1'.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, after the loop, there is no code. The loop runs k times. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop, there is no code. So the loop runs up to i <k. For example, if k is 5, the loop runs for i=0 to 4. For each of these, if the character is not '1', output it and return. If all are '1's, then after the loop, the code exits. But in Java, the code returns after the loop. Wait, no, the code in Java is inside the loop. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe loop is for (int i = 0; i <k; i++). So the loop runs exactly k times. For each iteration:\n\nIf c[i] is '1', then check if i is k-1. If so, output 1 and return. Else, continue.\n\nElse, output c[i] and return.\n\nSo the code checks each of the first k characters. If any is not '1', output it. If all are '1's, then during the k-th iteration (i=k-1), output '1'.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo the code will output the first non-'1' in the first k characters, or '1' if all are '1's.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop from 1 to k (since Fortran indices start at 1). For each i in 1..k:\n\nIf the i-th character is '1', then check if i is equal to k. If yes, print '1' and exit.\n\nIf the i-th character is not '1', print it and exit.\n\nOtherwise, continue.\n\nSo the Fortran code should loop over each character in the first k positions. If any is not '1', output it. If all are '1's, output '1'.\n\nSo how to handle this.\n\nBut in Fortran, the string may have a length less than k, so we need to check that i is within the length.\n\nBut in the original code, the Java code assumes that the string is long enough. So perhaps the Fortran code can proceed under the same assumption.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the string and k.\n\n2. Loop i from 1 to k.\n\n3. For each i, check if the i-th character is '1'.\n\n4. If not, print that character and stop.\n\n5. If it is '1', check if i ==k. If yes, print '1' and stop.\n\n6. Else, continue.\n\nBut in Java, the code returns when i ==k-1 (since i <k). Wait, the Java code's loop runs for i from 0 to k-1 (since i <k). So when k is 5, i runs 0,1,2,3,4. So the code checks up to the 5th character (0-based), which is the 5th character (1-based in Fortran). Then, during each iteration, if the character is '1', and if i is k-1 (i.e., 4 when k is 5), then output 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, when i runs from 1 to k (1-based), in each iteration, check if the character is '1'. If not, output. If yes, and i ==k, then output '1' and exit. So this would replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nWait, for example, in Java, for i=0 to k-1. So when k=5, i runs 0-4 (5 iterations). So in Fortran, the loop would run i=1 to 5 (5 iterations). For each i, check the character at position i.\n\nIn the Java code, when i is 4 (k-1 where k=5), the code checks if i ==k-1 (which is true), then outputs 1 and returns. So in Fortran, when i is 5 (the last iteration), check if the character is '1', then since i ==k, output '1' and exit.\n\nSo the logic in Fortran would be:\n\nloop i from 1 to k:\n\n   if s(i:i) /= '1' then\n\n       print s(i:i)\n\n       exit\n\n   else if i ==k then\n\n       print '1'\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend loop\n\nYes, this would replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the string may be shorter than k. For example, if the input string is '111' and k is 5. Then, when i reaches 4, which is beyond the length of the string, accessing s(4:4) would be invalid. But the original code in Java would throw an exception in such a case. So perhaps the problem statement ensures that the input string is at least k characters long. Therefore, the Fortran code can proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input string, s.\n\nRead k as a long integer.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   if s(i:i) is not '1', then print it and exit.\n\n   else:\n\n       if i ==k: print '1' and exit.\n\n       else: continue.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: s  ! assuming a maximum length; adjust as needed\n    integer(kind=8) :: k\n    integer :: i, n\n\n    read(*,*) s\n    read(*,*) k\n\n    do i = 1, k\n        if (s(i:i) /= '1') then\n            write(*, '(a)') s(i:i)\n            stop\n        else if (i == k) then\n            write(*, '(a)') '1'\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\nend program main\n\nWait, but the problem is, in Fortran, the length of the string may not be known. So if the input string is shorter than k, then the loop will try to access s(i:i) where i exceeds the length of the string, which is invalid. So perhaps we need to first get the length of the string and check against k.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the code reads the entire string, converts to a char array, and the loop runs up to k, which may be beyond the array's length. So if the string is shorter than k, the code would crash. But the problem statement probably ensures that the string is long enough. So in the Fortran code, perhaps we can proceed under that assumption. However, to avoid runtime errors, perhaps we should check the actual length and loop up to the minimum of k and the length. But this would change the logic. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in the original code, if the string is shorter than k, then in Java, accessing c[i] would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But in the problem, perhaps the input is such that the string is at least k characters long. Therefore, the Fortran code can proceed under that assumption.\n\nBut in practice, if the string is shorter than k, the code would crash. So perhaps in the Fortran code, the loop should run up to min(k, len(s)).\n\nBut that's a possible discrepancy. Let's think. Suppose the string is '11' and k is 3. In Java, the code would loop i=0,1,2 (k=3). But the string length is 2, so when i=2 (third iteration), c[2] would be out of bounds, causing an exception. So the code would crash. So the Fortran code would also crash in such a scenario. So if the problem's input ensures that the string is at least k characters long, then the code is safe. Otherwise, it's a bug. But since the original code doesn't handle this, the Fortran code shouldn't either.\n\nTherefore, proceed with the code as written.\n\nAnother thing: the Fortran code uses the 'do' loop from 1 to k. So if k is 0, but in the problem statement, k is a positive integer. Since the Java code reads a 'long' which can be up to 1e18, but in practice, k must be at least 1. Because the loop runs for i=0 to k-1. If k is 0, the loop doesn't run, but in the code, there is no code after the loop. So the Java code would not output anything. But in the problem statement, perhaps k is always at least 1. So the Fortran code would loop from 1 to k, which for k=0 is invalid. But the problem may not handle that. But in the original code, since k is read as a long, it's possible that k is 0, leading to no output. But in practice, the problem's test cases probably have k >=1. So proceed.\n\nNow, in Fortran, when reading the input string, leading or trailing spaces may be an issue. For example, when the input is given as a line, like '1234 5', the '1234' is the string and 5 is k. So using read(*,*) s would read the string correctly. But in Fortran, the default read for a character variable reads until the first whitespace. So that's correct. The Java code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token, which is the string. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead s as a string (until first whitespace), then read k.\n\nThen loop as before.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n1214\n3\n\nJava code checks the first 3 characters: '1', '2', '1'. The first non-1 is '2' at position 2 (Java index 1). So the code outputs '2'.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would check i=1: '1' (same as Java's 0), continue. i=2: '2' (Java's 1), output '2' and exit.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n111\n2\n\nJava code loops i=0 and 1. Both are '1's. i=1 is k-1 (k=2, i=1). So output '1'.\n\nFortran code loops i=1 and 2 (k=2). For i=1: '1', check if i==2? No. Continue. i=2: '1', check if i==2. Yes. Output '1'.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput '1', k=1. Java code checks i=0 (k=1, i <1 \u2192 i=0). Since it's '1', i ==k-1 (0 ==0), output 1. Fortran code i=1 (k=1). '1', i ==1 \u2192 output '1'.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: '112', k=3. Java code checks i=0 (1), i=1 (1), i=2 (2). Output '2'. Fortran code checks i=1 (1), i=2 (1), i=3 (2). Output '2'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as follows."
