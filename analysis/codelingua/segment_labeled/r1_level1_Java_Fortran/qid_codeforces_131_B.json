  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n from input. Then it initializes an array cnt of size 21 with type long. The next loop reads n integers, adding 10 to each, and increments the corresponding index in cnt. So for example, if the input number is -10, adding 10 makes it 0, so cnt[0] increases. If the input is 10, adding 10 makes 20, so cnt[20] increases. The cnt array is counting how many times each adjusted value (from -10 to +10, adjusted to 0-20) appears.\n\nThen, the code calculates the result. For i from 0 to 9, it multiplies cnt[i] by cnt[20 - i] and adds that to res. So for i=0, 20 - i is 20, so cnt[0] * cnt[20], which corresponds to the pairs of -10 and +10. Similarly for other i values. Then, for the middle element (which is 10 after adjustment, i.e., index 10 in the array), it calculates combinations of 2, which is cnt[10] choose 2, since those elements are zero when added to themselves (since -10 + x + 10 + x = 0 only if x is the same). \n\nThe final result is the sum of these parts.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, we need to read an integer n. Then declare an array cnt of size 21, initialized to zero. Then read n integers, add 10 to each, and increment the corresponding cnt index. \n\nIn Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default, but in Java, it's 0-based. Wait, in the Java code, the cnt array is from 0 to 20. For example, when a number is -10, after adding 10, it's 0, so cnt[0]++. So in Fortran, perhaps the array should be 0-based. But Fortran's default is 1-based. So maybe the Fortran code should declare the cnt array from 0 to 20. Alternatively, adjust the indices.\n\nBut Fortran allows specifying the lower and upper bounds of an array. So we can declare cnt as (0:20) to match the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_size = 20\ninteger :: n, i, temp\ninteger(kind=8) :: cnt(0:max_size), res\n\nThen, read n. Then loop n times, read each temp, add 10, increment cnt(temp).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read from input, you need to make sure that each read gets the next number. So the code would be:\n\nread(*,*) n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) temp\n    idx = temp + 10\n    cnt(idx) = cnt(idx) + 1\nend do\n\nBut need to initialize cnt to zero. So:\n\ncnt = 0_8\n\nBut in Fortran, the kind for integers. So perhaps using integer(8) for cnt and res. Because in Java, the cnt array is of type long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using 8-byte integers.\n\nSo the declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20) = 0_8\n\nWait, but initializing an array in Fortran. Maybe need to initialize it in the code.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20)\ncnt = 0\n\nBut the kind should be specified.

So let's proceed.\n\nThen, after populating cnt, compute res.\n\nThe first loop in Java is for i from 0 to 9 (inclusive?), because in the Java code it's i < 10, so 0-9. For each i, res += cnt[i] * cnt[20 - i]. So in Fortran, 0 <= i <=9. So loop i from 0 to 9.\n\nres = 0\n\ndo i = 0,9\n    res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20 - i)\nend do\n\nThen, add the combinations part: cnt[10] * (cnt[10] - 1) / 2. Which is the number of pairs possible in the elements that are zero (original value of 10-10=0, so the original numbers were 0).\n\nIn Fortran, that would be:\n\nres = res + ( cnt(10) * (cnt(10) - 1) ) / 2\n\nBut since all variables are integers, division in Fortran with / truncates towards zero.

For example, if all numbers are zero. Then cnt(10) is n, and res becomes (n*(n-1))/2.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, inputs -10 and 10. Then cnt(0) is 1, cnt(20) is 1. So res += 1*1. Then cnt(10) is 0, so the second part adds 0. Total res is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, all zeros. Then cnt(10) is 3. The second part adds 3*2/2 =3.
