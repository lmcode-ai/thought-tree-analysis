  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. Then it computes some values using factorials and modular inverses. The main steps seem to be calculating p as the factorial of n modulo 1e9+7, then computing an array q where each element is a cumulative sum of the modular inverses. Finally, it calculates the answer by iterating over each element in a and combining values from q with the elements of a.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the input. Java uses BufferedReader, but in Fortran, I'll read from standard input. For the array a, I can read a line and parse the integers.\n\nNext, the factorial part. In Java, p is initialized to 1 and multiplied by each i from 2 to n. So in Fortran, a loop from 2 to n, multiplying and taking mod at each step.\n\nThen, the array q. q[0] is 1, and each subsequent element is (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod)) % mod. The modinv function calculates the modular inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm. So I need to implement that in Fortran as a function.\n\nWait, Fortran has functions and subroutines. So I'll write a function modinv that takes a and m and returns the inverse. Let me check the Java code for modinv. It's the extended Euclidean algorithm where a and m are coprime. The code uses variables u and v to track the coefficients. I'll need to replicate that logic.\n\nIn Fortran, since variables are passed by value, the function can be written as a recursive or iterative approach. But the Java code uses a loop, so I'll do the same in Fortran.\n\nNow, for the array q. Since q starts at index 0 (Fortran arrays start at 1 by default), I'll have to adjust indices. Wait, in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, if I declare q as (n), then q(1) corresponds to q[0], etc. Let me think: when Java has q[i] for i from 0 to n-1, Fortran's q will be from 1 to n. So when i starts at 1 in Java (since q[0] is 1), the loop in Fortran for q would start from 2 up to n. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nJava's q is initialized as new long[n]. q[0] = 1. Then for i from 1 to n-1, q[i] = (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod)) % mod. So in Fortran, q(1) corresponds to Java's q[0], so for Fortran's q(1) = 1. Then for i from 2 to n (since Java's i runs from 1 to n-1, which is 1-based in Fortran terms), q(i) = q(i-1) + modinv(i, mod), since in Java, when i is 1, i+1 is 2. So in Fortran, for i from 2 to n, the Java code's i+1 is (Fortran's i) + 1? Wait no. Wait in Java, when the loop is for i from 1 to n-1, the code uses i+1. For example, when i=1, modinv(2, mod), when i=2, modinv(3, mod), etc. So in Fortran, for the loop index j which runs from 1 to n-1 (Java's i), the modinv argument is (j+1) in Java, which would be (i+1) where i is the Fortran index. Wait, perhaps it's easier to adjust the indices.\n\nLet me think: Java's q has elements q[0], q[1], ..., q[n-1]. Fortran's q will be q(1), q(2), ..., q(n). So q(1) = q[0], q(2) = q[1], etc.\n\nSo in Java, for i from 1 to n-1 (so n-1 elements in q after the first), in Fortran, the loop runs from 2 to n. So the modinv in Fortran for each j (from 2 to n) is modinv(j, mod). Because Java's i starts at 1, and for each step, the argument is i+1. So when i=1 (Java), modinv(2, mod). In Fortran, when j=2 (Fortran index), we need to compute modinv(2, mod), so the argument is j. So in Fortran, for j from 2 to n, q(j) = q(j-1) + modinv(j, mod). But wait, in Java, the first q[0] is 1. Then for q[1], we add modinv(2). So in Fortran's q(1) = 1. Then for j=2 to n (since Java's loop runs up to n-1, which is q's indices up to n-1, but in Fortran that's up to j = n). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's q array has n elements. So when n is the input, Java's q has indexes from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, we need to declare q as dimension(n). So q(1) corresponds to Java's q[0], q(2) to q[1], ..., q(n) to q[n-1].\n\nThen, the loop for filling q in Java is from i=1 to i=n-1. So in Fortran, we loop from j=2 to j=n. For each j, the code is:\n\nq[j] = (q[j-1] + modinv(j+1, mod)) % mod\n\nWait, no. Wait Java's code for i starts at 1 (since q starts at index 0 and initializes that first). So when i=1 (Java's loop variable), the code computes modinv(i+1, mod) which is modinv(2, mod). Then q[i] (Java's index 1) becomes q[i-1] (index 0) plus modinv(2). So in Fortran, for j=2 (since the Java index is 1), we need to compute modinv(2). So for Fortran's j (loop variable from 2 to n), modinv(j) where j is the argument.\n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\nq(1) = 1\n\ndo j = 2, n\n    q(j) = mod(q(j-1) + modinv(j, mod), mod)\nend do\n\nYes, because for each j in Fortran's loop (which corresponds to Java's i in 1..n-1), the modinv argument is (Java's i+1) which is (j) in Fortran's index. Because Java's i starts at 1, j in Fortran starts at 2 (since j=2 is the first step after the initial q(1) = 1).\n\nSo that part is handled.\n\nThen, the main loop in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    long val = q[i] + q[n - i - 1] - 1;\n    val *= a[i];\n    val %= mod;\n    val *= p;\n    val %= mod;\n    ans += val;\n    ans %= mod;\n}\n\nIn Fortran, since the arrays are 1-based, the loop will run from i=1 to i=n. For each i, the Java code uses q[i] (Fortran's q(i+1)? Wait no. Wait in Java, i ranges from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, the loop is from 1 to n. For each i in Fortran's loop (1-based), Java's index is i-1. So the Java code's q[i] is q in Fortran at (i) +1? Wait no. Wait, Java's q is 0-based. So q[i] in Java is q(i+1) in Fortran. For example, Java's q[0] is Fortran's q(1), Java's q[1] is q(2), etc. So when Java's i is 0, q[i] is q(1). So in the main loop:\n\nJava's q[i] is Fortran's q(i+1), but wait no. Wait Java's loop variable i runs from 0 to n-1. For each i, the code accesses q[i] and q[n - i -1]. Let's take n as an example. Suppose n=5. Then, for Java's i=0: q[0] and q[4-0-1=4] (since n=5, n -i-1=5-0-1=4? Wait no, n is the input variable. Wait for example, if n is 5, then n - i -1 is 5 -0 -1=4. So q[4] is accessed. In Fortran, Java's q[4] is q(5). \n\nSo for Fortran's loop variable i, which runs from 1 to n (since Java's loop is 0-based), the Java code's i is (i-1) in Fortran terms. So for each Fortran i, Java's code is for (i-1).\n\nSo the val computation in Java is:\n\nq[i] + q[n - (i) -1] - 1\n\nIn Fortran terms, since Java's q[i] is q(i) in Fortran? Wait, no. Wait Java's q is 0-based. So q[i] in Java is q(i+1) in Fortran. Because for Java's index 0, it's Fortran's index 1. So when Java's code uses q[i], in Fortran that's q(i+1). But wait, for example, Java's loop runs i from 0 to n-1. So Fortran's i loops from 1 to n. For each Fortran i, the Java i is (i-1). So Java's q[i] is q(i-1+1) = q(i) in Fortran. Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think:\n\nJava's i ranges from 0 to n-1. So for each Fortran i (1 to n), the Java i is (i-1). So q[i] in Java is q[(i-1)] in Java's 0-based array, which is Fortran's q(i) (since Java's 0-based index (i-1) corresponds to Fortran's 1-based index i). So yes, in Fortran, q(i) is equivalent to Java's q[i-1], but in this part of the code, when Java's i is (Fortran's i-1), then Java's q[i] is q(i-1 + 1) in Fortran? Wait, no. Let's take a concrete example. Let's say Fortran's i=1, which corresponds to Java's i=0. Java's q[i] is q[0], which is Fortran's q(1). So for Fortran's i=1, the Java code's q[i] is q(1). Similarly, when Fortran's i=2, Java's i=1, so q[1] in Java is q(2) in Fortran.\n\nSo, in the val calculation in Java, q[i] (Java's i) is Fortran's q(i+1 -1) = q(i) when Fortran's loop is over i=1 to n. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's restate:\n\nFortran's loop variable is i, which runs from 1 to n. For each i in Fortran, the Java code's i is (i-1). So Java's code for val is:\n\nval = q[i_java] + q[n_java - i_java -1] - 1\n\nBut n_java is the same as n in Fortran. So substituting i_java = i-1:\n\nval = q[i_java] + q[n - (i-1) -1] -1 \n\n= q[i_java] + q[n - i] -1 \n\nIn Java's indices. So in Fortran, q[i_java] is Fortran's q(i_java + 1) = q(i-1 +1) = q(i). \n\nWait, Java's q[i_java] is at index i_java. Since in Fortran, q is 1-based, Java's index i_java corresponds to Fortran's index i_java +1. So q_java[i_java] = q_fortran(i_java +1).\n\nBut i_java is (i-1) in Fortran's loop. So q_java[i_java] is q_fortran( (i-1) +1 ) = q_fortran(i). \n\nSimilarly, the term q_java[n - i_java -1] is q_java[ (n - (i-1) -1) ] = q_java[ n -i ]. So in Java's index, that's n -i. Which in Fortran is (n -i) +1 = n -i +1. \n\nSo in Fortran, val is:\n\nval = q(i) + q(n - i +1) - 1\n\nWait let's verify with an example. Suppose n=5, Fortran's i=2 (Java's i=1). Then Java's code:\n\nq[1] (Fortran q(2)) and q[5-1-1=3] (Java's index 3, which is Fortran's q(4)). So in Fortran, val would be q(2) + q(4) -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the val in Fortran is q(i) + q(n - (i-1) -1 +1) -1. Wait no, perhaps better to think:\n\nJava's term for q[n - i_java -1] where i_java = i-1 (Fortran's loop variable i). So n - (i-1) -1 = n -i +1 -1 = n -i. So in Java's index, that's n -i. So Fortran's index is (n -i) +1 = n -i +1. \n\nSo the val in Fortran is:\n\nval = q(i) + q(n - i +1) -1\n\nMultiply that by a(i), then mod, then multiply by p, mod again, add to ans.\n\nSo the Fortran code for the main loop would be:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    val = (q(i) + q(n - i + 1) - 1) * a(i)\n    val = mod(val, mod_val)\n    val = val * p\n    val = mod(val, mod_val)\n    ans = mod(ans + val, mod_val)\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, a is 0-based. So a[i_java] in Java is a(i) in Fortran's 1-based array. Because when Java's i is (i-1) in Fortran's loop, the a in Java is 0-based. So a_java[i_java] is a_fortran(i_java +1) = a_fortran(i). So yes.\n\nSo that part is handled.\n\nNow, handling the modinv function. The Java code uses a loop-based extended Euclidean algorithm. So in Fortran, the function modinv(a, m) would return the modular inverse of a mod m. Let's implement that. \n\nThe function in Java:\n\nstatic long modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1;\n    long v = 0;\n    long tmp = 0;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n        u -= t * v;\n        tmp = u; u = v; v = tmp;\n    }\n    u %= m;\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u;\n}\n\nIn Fortran, since we need to handle 64-bit integers (since Java uses long), but Fortran's integers can be 32 or 64-bit, depending on the compiler. To avoid overflow, perhaps use integer(kind=8) variables. So variables a, b, u, v, tmp, t should be 64-bit integers.\n\nSo the Fortran function:\n\nfunction modinv(a, m) result(res)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: a, m\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    integer(kind=8) :: b, u, v, tmp, t, a0, b0\n\n    a0 = a\n    b0 = m\n    u = 1_8\n    v = 0_8\n\n    b = b0\n\n    do while (b > 0)\n        t = a0 / b\n        a0 = a0 - t * b\n        tmp = a0\n        a0 = b\n        b = tmp\n\n        u = u - t * v\n        tmp = u\n        u = v\n        v = tmp\n    end do\n\n    u = modulo(u, m)\n    if (u < 0) u = u + m\n\n    res = u\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables inside the function need to handle the input a and m. Also, note that in Java, the parameters are (a, m), and the code modifies a and b (which starts as m). So in the function, a and b are copies. So in Fortran, the parameters are a and m, and variables a0 and b0 are initialized to a and m, then modified.\n\nBut wait, in Java, a is a long passed into modinv. The code uses a and m, which are parameters, but then modifies a and b (b is set to m). So in Fortran, we need to work with copies of a and m.\n\nSo in the Fortran function, a0 and b0 are initialized to a and m. Then, during the loop, a0 and b are modified. Wait, let's see:\n\nJava's code starts with:\n\nlong b = m;\nlong u = 1;\nlong v = 0;\nlong tmp = 0;\nwhile (b > 0) {\n    long t = a / b;\n    a -= t * b;\n    tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n    u -= t * v;\n    tmp = u; u = v; v = tmp;\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the initial a is a (the input), and b is m. Then, the loop continues while b >0. So in Fortran:\n\na0 = a\nb0 = m\n\nBut wait, no: in Java, the code uses the parameter a, which is a long (64-bit). So in Fortran, a and m are inputs. Then, the variables a0 and b are initialized as a and m. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nIn Java:\n\nlong a (parameter) is passed, then we assign b = m.\n\nBut in the loop, a and b are swapped. So in Fortran, we can start with:\n\na0 = a\nb = m\n\nu = 1\nv = 0\n\nThen in the loop:\n\nt = a0 / b\na0 = a0 - t * b\nswap a0 and b\nswap u and v (after adjusting u by t*v)\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nfunction modinv(a, m) result(res)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: a, m\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    integer(kind=8) :: a0, b, u, v, t, tmp\n\n    a0 = a\n    b = m\n    u = 1_8\n    v = 0_8\n\n    do while (b > 0)\n        t = a0 / b\n        a0 = a0 - t * b\n        ! swap a0 and b\n        tmp = a0\n        a0 = b\n        b = tmp\n\n        ! adjust u and v\n        u = u - t * v\n        ! swap u and v\n        tmp = u\n        u = v\n        v = tmp\n    end do\n\n    u = modulo(u, m)\n    if (u < 0) u = u + m\n\n    res = u\nend function\n\nWait, but after the loop, Java's code checks if u is negative and adds m if necessary. But in Fortran, modulo(u, m) should return u in [0, m), but perhaps Java allows negative values. Let me check:\n\nIn Java, u % m returns a value with the same sign as m. But since m is 1e9+7 (positive), u % m would be positive. However, Java's code then checks if u is negative and adds m. So modulo(u, m) in Fortran would give the same result as Java's code. So the line u = modulo(u, m) ensures it's in the range [0, m). So the 'if (u < 0)' check is redundant, but perhaps kept for safety. But in Fortran, modulo(u, m) would handle that.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to read n, then read a line of integers into array a.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with read(*,*) statements. However, when the input is given as a single line, after n, the next line is a list of integers. So:\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,*) a\n\nBut a needs to be declared as an array of integers with dimension(n). So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(a(n))\nread(*,*) a\n\nBut in Java, the code reads the a's as integers. So in Fortran, a is an integer array.\n\nBut then, during the computation, a is accessed as a(i) in Fortran, which is correct.\n\nNow, compute p as the product of 2 to n, modulo mod.\n\nmod_val is 1000000007.\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: p\np = 1_8\ndo i = 2, n\n    p = mod(p * i, mod_val)\nend do\n\nThen compute array q:\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: q(:)\nallocate(q(n))\nq(1) = 1_8\ndo j = 2, n\n    inv = modinv(j, mod_val)\n    q(j) = mod(q(j-1) + inv, mod_val)\nend do\n\nWait, j starts at 2 to n. Because for j=2, modinv(2) is the inverse of 2. Then q(2) = q(1) + inv. Which matches the Java code's q[1] = q[0] + modinv(2).\n\nNow, the main loop:\n\nans is initialized to 0.\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans, val\nans = 0_8\ndo i = 1, n\n    val = (q(i) + q(n - i + 1) - 1_8) * a(i)\n    val = mod(val, mod_val)\n    val = mod(val * p, mod_val)\n    ans = mod(ans + val, mod_val)\nend do\n\nWait, but a(i) is an integer in Fortran. But in Java, the a array is integers. But when multiplied by val (a long), the product is a long. In Fortran, since a is integer, val is integer(kind=8), so a(i) should be cast to 8 bytes. So perhaps a should be declared as integer(kind=8) array.\n\nAh, right! Because in Fortran, if a is a default integer (4 bytes), multiplying by an 8-byte integer could cause overflow. So to prevent that, the a array should be of integer(kind=8). So:\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n...\nread(*,*) a\n\nWait, but when reading into a, if the input is given as integers, Fortran's read will assign them as the kind of a. So if a is declared as integer(kind=8), then the input is read as such.\n\nSo, the code for reading a is:\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nBut the user may input numbers, and Fortran will read them into a as 8-byte integers.\n\nThus, the complete code steps:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read a array (n elements).\n- Compute p = product of 2 to n, mod mod_val.\n- Compute array q using modinv.\n- Compute ans by iterating over each element of a, using q and p.\n\nNow, handling the modinv function. In Fortran, functions can be placed in the contains section of a program or module. Since this is a single program, the function can be inside the program's contains section.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: mod_val, p, ans, val, inv\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: q(:)\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    mod_val = 1000000007_8\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) a\n\n    ! Compute p\n    p = 1_8\n    do i = 2, n\n        p = mod(p * i, mod_val)\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute q\n    allocate(q(n))\n    q(1) = 1_8\n    do j = 2, n\n        inv = modinv(int(j, kind=8), mod_val)\n        q(j) = mod(q(j-1) + inv, mod_val)\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute ans\n    ans = 0_8\n    do i = 1, n\n        val = (q(i) + q(n - i + 1) - 1_8) * a(i)\n        val = mod(val, mod_val)\n        val = mod(val * p, mod_val)\n        ans = mod(ans + val, mod_val)\n    end do\n\n    print '(i0)', ans\n\ncontains\n\n    function modinv(a, m) result(res)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: a, m\n        integer(kind=8) :: res\n        integer(kind=8) :: a0, b, u, v, t, tmp\n\n        a0 = a\n        b = m\n        u = 1_8\n        v = 0_8\n\n        do while (b > 0)\n            t = a0 / b\n            a0 = a0 - t * b\n            tmp = a0\n            a0 = b\n            b = tmp\n\n            u = u - t * v\n            tmp = u\n            u = v\n            v = tmp\n        end do\n\n        u = modulo(u, m)\n        if (u < 0) u = u + m\n        res = u\n    end function modinv\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the do while loop in modinv, the syntax is do while (b > 0). Also, Fortran requires variables to be declared. So the variables inside modinv are correctly declared.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. When reading a, the elements are read into an integer(kind=8) array. This should work if the input is given as integers.\n\n2. The modinv function uses a0 and b as 8-byte integers. The parameters a and m are 8-byte integers.\n\n3. When j is an integer (loop variable from 2 to n), and passed as an argument to modinv, j must be cast to 8-byte integer. Because in Fortran, j is default integer (4 bytes). So in the call to modinv, j should be converted to 8-byte. So the line inv = modinv(int(j, kind=8), mod_val).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the loop for q, j runs from 2 to n, and modinv is called with j as the argument, which in Fortran is the same as Java's i+1 when i starts at 1 (Java's loop for q). Which is correct.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nFor example, if n=3, and a = [1, 2, 3].\n\nBut perhaps better to test with small cases.\n\nBut assuming the code is translated correctly.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should look like this."
