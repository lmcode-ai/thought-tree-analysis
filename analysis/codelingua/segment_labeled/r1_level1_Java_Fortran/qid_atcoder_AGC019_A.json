  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads five long integers: Q, H, S, D, N. Then it calculates the minimum price for one liter. The one liter price is the minimum of Q*4, H*2, and S. Then, it checks if this onePrice is cheaper than half of D. If so, it just multiplies onePrice by N. Otherwise, it uses as many D (which is for 2 liters) as possible, and the remainder is covered by onePrice.\n\nSo, the main steps are reading inputs, calculating the one-liter cost, comparing with D/2, and then outputting the total cost.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's recall Fortran's syntax. Variables in Fortran need to be declared. The data types: integers would be INTEGER(8) perhaps, since Java uses long. But maybe in Fortran, depending on the compiler, we can just use INTEGER*8 or INTEGER(KIND=8). Let's go with INTEGER*8 for all variables to handle large numbers like Java's long.\n\nInput in Fortran is done using READ(*,*) which reads from standard input. Output is done with WRITE(*,*).\n\nSo, first, declare variables Q, H, S, D, N, onePrice, total, etc. Wait, in the Java code, all variables are of type long. So in Fortran, they should be 8-byte integers.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables Q, H, S, D, N, onePrice as INTEGER*8.\n2. Read the five values from input in order.\n3. Compute onePrice as the minimum of Q*4, H*2, and S.\n4. Compare if onePrice is less than or equal to D/2. But since D is integer, D/2 in Java would be integer division. Wait, in Java, when you divide a long by 2, it's integer division. However, in the Java code, the comparison is done using (double) onePrice <= (double) D / 2. So this is comparing floating points.

Since we want to use double precision for the division.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, if D is an integer, D / 2.0d0 would be a double precision real. So comparing an integer (onePrice) to a real. That's allowed; Fortran will convert the integer to a real for the comparison.\n\nSo if onePrice is less than or equal to D/2.0, then the total is N * onePrice. Else, the total is (N//2)*D + mod(N,2)*onePrice.\n\nSo for the else case, integer division and modulus.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nIF (onePrice <= (D / 2.0d0)) THEN\n    total = N * onePrice\nELSE\n    total = (N / 2) * D + MOD(N, 2) * onePrice\nEND IF\n\nWait, but in Java, N is a long, and division of two longs is integer division.

So 1*D +1*onePrice.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the code should be as written above. Need to check the syntax. For example, in Fortran, variable declarations, and using .0d0 for double precision.
