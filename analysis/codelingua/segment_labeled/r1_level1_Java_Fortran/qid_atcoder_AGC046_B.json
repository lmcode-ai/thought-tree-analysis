  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it does.\n\nThe Java code uses a dynamic programming approach. There's a 2D array dp of size 3001x3001. The solve method reads four integers A, B, C, D and initializes dp[A][B] to 1. Then, it loops from c=A to C and d=B to D, calculating the value for dp[c][d] based on previous values. The main method handles input and output.\n\nFirst, I need to set up similar structures in Fortran. Let's think about the variables:\n\n- MOD is 998244353 as a long in Java. In Fortran, I'll use a parameter integer, maybe integer, parameter :: MOD = 998244353.\n- The dp array is 3001x3001. Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses indices starting from A and B, which are probably 0 or 1-based? Wait, looking at the input: A, B, C, D are read from input. Let's see in the Java code, when c starts at A, and d starts at B. So if A is 0, then the indices would start at 0. But Java arrays are 0-based. Wait, the code initializes dp[A][B] = 1. So in Java, the array is 3001 elements in each dimension, which can go up to index 3000. So when the input is given, A and B are probably starting from some lower value, maybe 1?\n\nWait, but in the code, when c is A and d is B, the loop skips. Then for c > A or d > B, they use previous entries. So the indices in the dp array probably start from the given A and B. So perhaps A and B can be as low as 0, but the problem likely expects them to be within the range of the array.\n\nBut in Fortran, array indices can be set to start at certain values. However, since in the Java code, the loops run from c = A to C, and similarly for d, and the dp array is of size 3001, which probably covers up to 3000. So perhaps in Java, the indices are from 0 to 3000. Therefore, when translating to Fortran, we can adjust the indices to start from 1 if needed, but maybe keeping them 0-based would be better. Or perhaps we can adjust the code to use 1-based indices.\n\nBut Fortran is more flexible with array indices. Let's think: in the Java code, the dp array is declared as [3001][3001], which allows indices from 0 to 3000. So for the problem's constraints, A, B, C, D are up to 3000.\n\nSo in Fortran, to have a similar array, I can declare the dp array with indices from 0:3000. So in Fortran, the declaration would be:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3000, 0:3000) :: dp\n\nBut Fortran's default is 1-based, so if I explicitly set the lower bounds to 0, that would match Java's 0-based indices.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loops start at c=A and d=B, which can be 0, and go up to C and D. So when A is 0, c starts at 0. So the Fortran array must handle 0-based indices.\n\nSo, declare dp as (0:3000, 0:3000).\n\nNext, the MOD is applied as (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD. In Fortran, modulo can be done with the mod function, but since ans can be negative (due to the subtraction term), adding MOD and then taking mod again ensures it's positive. So in Fortran, it's similar: ans is computed, then mod(ans, MOD), but since Fortran's mod can return negative values when the dividend is negative, we need to make sure the result is positive. So perhaps ans modulo MOD is computed, then if it's negative, add MOD. But in the Java code, it's (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD. So even if ans is negative, adding MOD and then mod again. So in Fortran, the same can be done with mod(ans, MOD). However, let's check:\n\nSuppose ans is -5, MOD is 998244353. Then mod(-5, MOD) in Fortran would be 998244348. So (ans mod MOD) is the same as Java's ans % MOD. But Java's % can return negative results if the dividend is negative. Wait, no: Java's % returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. Wait, no: in Java, the result of a % b has the same sign as the dividend. So for example, -5 % 7 is -5. Then, adding 7 and mod again. So in Java code, ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD ensures that the result is positive.\n\nIn Fortran, the mod function returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. Wait, no: according to Fortran's mod function, mod(a, p) returns a - int(a/p)*p. So for negative numbers, the sign of the result is the same as a. Wait, let me check: mod(7,3) is 1; mod(-7,3) is -1. But when the divisor is positive, the result is in the range (-p, p). So to get the positive mod, perhaps in Fortran, we can use modulo function instead of mod. The modulo function for integers returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So modulo(-7,3) would be 2.\n\nSo, in Fortran, to replicate the Java code's ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD, perhaps we can use modulo(ans, MOD), which would give a non-negative result. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor example, if ans is -5, modulo(-5, MOD) is MOD -5. Which is the same as (ans + MOD) % MOD in Java. So perhaps in Fortran, modulo(ans, MOD) would give the correct result, equivalent to the Java code.\n\nSo for the line dp[c][d] = ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD in Java, in Fortran, we can compute modulo(ans, MOD), and then assign that to dp(c,d).\n\nBut let's check:\n\nIn Java, if ans is 1000, then (1000 % MOD) is 1000, add MOD gives 1000+ MOD, then mod MOD gives 1000. So modulo(ans, MOD) in Fortran would be 1000.\n\nIf ans is -5, then Java's (ans % MOD) is -5. Adding MOD gives MOD-5. Then mod MOD gives MOD-5. Which is the same as modulo(-5, MOD) in Fortran.\n\nSo yes, in Fortran, we can use modulo(ans, MOD) to get the same result as Java's ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after computing ans, set dp(c, d) = modulo(ans, MOD).\n\nNow, the main steps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D from input.\n\n2. Initialize dp(A, B) = 1.\n\n3. Loop c from A to C, and d from B to D.\n\n4. For each (c, d), compute ans based on the previous values.\n\nIn Java, the loops are:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n    for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n        if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n        ... compute ans ...\n        dp[c][d] = ...;\n    }\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loops would be similar. But Fortran's do loops are inclusive. So:\n\ndo c = A, C\n    do d = B, D\n        if (c == A .and. d == B) cycle\n        ... compute ans ...\n        dp(c, d) = ...\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut since in Fortran, array indices can start at 0, but when the user inputs A, B, etc., we need to make sure that the loops are correct. For example, if A is 0 and C is 3000, then the loop variables go from 0 to 3000.\n\nBut in the code, A, B, C, D are read as integers, probably from input. So in Fortran, we need to read them as such.\n\nNow, the variables are read in the Java code via Scanner: A=sc.nextInt(), etc. So in Fortran, we can read them from standard input.\n\nIn the main function of the Java code, the code reads from System.in and writes to System.out. In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input, and print to standard output.\n\nSo in Fortran, the main steps would be:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize dp to 0, then set dp(A,B) = 1.\n\nThen loop c from A to C, d from B to D, except (A,B).\n\nNow, the problem is handling the loops. But in Java, the loops are nested, so for each c, d is looped from B to D. So in Fortran, same.\n\nBut the order of the loops may matter. For example, in Java, for c in A to C, then d from B to D. So for each c, we process all d in B to D. So Fortran's loop order can be the same.\n\nBut how does this affect the computation? The order of processing c and d may affect the dependency on previous values. For example, in Java, when processing c and d, the code uses dp[c-1][d], dp[c][d-1], and dp[c-1][d-1]. So when processing (c, d), the previous cells (c-1, d) and (c, d-1) must have been processed already.\n\nIn Java, the loops are ordered as c from A to C, and for each c, d from B to D. So for each c, we process all d in B to D. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have c increasing. For each c, d increases from B to D. So for (c, d), (c-1, d) would have been processed in the previous c (c-1) iteration. But when d is processed in order from B to D, (c, d-1) is processed before (c, d). So the order is correct.\n\nSo the loop order is correct in Java, and the same should be done in Fortran.\n\nNow, the computation of ans:\n\nIn Java, ans is computed as:\n\nif (c > A) ans += part * d (where part is dp[c-1][d])\n\nif (d > B) ans += part * c (where part is dp[c][d-1])\n\nif (c > A && d > B) ans -= dp[c-1][d-1] * (c-1) * (d-1)\n\nSo the ans is the sum of the contributions from the left and top cells, minus the overlap.\n\nIn Fortran, this would be:\n\nans = 0\n\nif (c > A) then\n    part = dp(c-1, d)\n    ans = part * d\nend if\n\nif (d > B) then\n    part = dp(c, d-1)\n    ans = ans + part * c\nend if\n\nif (c > A .and. d > B) then\n    ans = ans - dp(c-1, d-1) * (c-1) * (d-1)\nend if\n\nThen, assign dp(c, d) = modulo(ans, MOD)\n\nBut in Java, the initial ans is 0, then first part is added (if c>A), then next part added (if d> B), then subtract (if both).\n\nSo the order is important.\n\nNow, initializing the dp array. In Java, the dp array is initially zero. So in Fortran, we need to initialize dp to 0. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3000, 0:3000) :: dp\ndp = 0\ndp(A, B) = 1\n\nBut wait, in Java, the dp array is a long array, which is 64-bit integers. In Fortran, the default integer might be 32-bit. So we need to use 64-bit integers. However, MOD is 998244353, which is around 1e9. So when multiplied by 3000*3000, the numbers could be up to 9e15, which is larger than 32-bit (which can hold up to 2^31-1 ~ 2e9). So 64-bit integers are needed.\n\nSo in Fortran, we should use integer with kind=8. So:\n\ninteger(kind=8), parameter :: MOD = 998244353\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(0:3000, 0:3000) :: dp\n...\n\nThus, the variables are declared as 64-bit integers to handle large values.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D from input.\n\n2. Initialize the dp array to 0, then set dp(A,B) = 1.\n\n3. Loop over c from A to C, and d from B to D.\n\n4. For each (c,d), skip if (c == A and d == B).\n\n5. Compute ans as per the rules.\n\n6. Assign dp(c,d) = modulo(ans, MOD).\n\n7. After processing all, print dp(C,D).\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- Fortran's indices: in the Java code, the dp array starts at 0, but when A is 0, c starts at 0. So in Fortran, the array is declared (0:3000, 0:3000), which matches.\n\n- Input: how to read four integers from input. In Fortran, read(*,*) A, B, C, D.\n\n- The initial assignment of dp(A,B) = 1. But if A and B are 0, then it's correct.\n\nTesting with sample input?\n\nBut perhaps not necessary here. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8), parameter :: MOD = 998244353_8\n    integer(kind=8) :: A, B, C, D\n    integer(kind=8) :: c, d\n    integer(kind=8) :: ans, part\n    integer(kind=8), dimension(0:3000, 0:3000) :: dp\n\n    !

But in Fortran, when we use integer(kind=8), A, B, etc., are 64-bit. But the input values for A, B, C, D could be up to 3000, which is within 32-bit range. So reading them as 64-bit is okay.\n\nBut when using read(*,*) A, B, C, D, Fortran will read the integers as per their kind. So if the input is given correctly, this should work.\n\nAnother possible issue is that in Java, the variables are int, but in Fortran, they are 64-bit. However, the values are small (<=3000), so no problem.\n\nNow, in the code, when we have part * d, etc. For example, part is a 64-bit integer, d is a 64-bit integer. Multiplying them could result in a 64-bit product, which is correct.\n\nBut what about the modulo operation? Since MOD is a parameter of kind 8, the modulo function will handle 64-bit integers.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs would help, but assuming the logic is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, do loops variables are by default incremented by 1. So the loop do c = A, C will cover all values from A to C, inclusive, stepping by 1, which matches Java's for loops.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the loops for c and d are from A to C and B to D, respectively. So in Fortran, the same loops.\n\nNow, in the Java code, dp is a long array, which is 64-bit. In Fortran, we use integer(kind=8) for dp, which is correct.\n\nThus, the translated code should work as intended."
