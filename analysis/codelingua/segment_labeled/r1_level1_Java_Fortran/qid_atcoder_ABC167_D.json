But a can be up to N (which is 1e6), so ans is up to N-1 + N, which is 2e6, which fits in 4-byte integers. But in Fortran, the array indices must be integers of the default kind, which is typically 4 bytes. So ans should be of type integer (4 bytes). But K is 8-byte. So when K is very large, converting to integer(4) could cause overflow. So we need to ensure that ans is within the range of 4-byte integers. But since ans is computed as modulo (K - b, a) + b, and a is up to N (1e6), and b up to N, ans is up to 1e6 + 1e6 = 2e6, which is within the 4-byte integer range (up to 2^31-1 ~ 2e9). So no problem. But in Fortran, when you assign an integer(kind=8) to a variable of type integer (kind=4), it can cause truncation. So in the code above, ans is declared as integer(kind=8). But when used as an index in pos(ans), which is declared as integer(4) array, the code may have issues. So perhaps we should declare ans as integer. But how?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variable types must match when used as indices. So if ans is integer(kind=8), and pos is declared as integer(4) array, then pos(ans) would be allowed if the compiler supports it, but perhaps it's better to cast ans to default integer. But in the code above, 'ans' is computed as integer(kind=8). So when ans is within the bounds of pos (0 to N-1), which is up to 1e6, then converting it to a default integer is safe. So in the code, after computing ans as integer(kind=8), cast it to integer when accessing pos. But in Fortran, you can't directly index with integer(kind=8) variables if the compiler doesn't support it. So perhaps the code should declare ans as integer. But how to handle large K?",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java code reads integers N and K, then an array A of size N. Each element in A is decremented by 1. Then, it seems to track a path through the array A, using a set to detect cycles. The variables a and b are calculated, where a is the length of the cycle and b is the starting index of the cycle. Then, based on K's value, it computes ans and outputs the position plus one.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Read N and K.\n2. Read array A and subtract 1 from each element (since Java is 0-based but input might be 1-based).\n3. Traverse the array starting from index 0, keeping track of visited indices to find a cycle.\n4. Once a cycle is found, compute a (cycle length) and b (steps before the cycle starts).\n5. Determine ans based on K. If K is less than b, ans is K; else, compute using modulo to find the position in the cycle.\n6. Output pos[ans] + 1.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's start with the data structures.\n\nIn Java, they use a HashSet for 'used', and arrays 'idx' and 'pos' of size N. So in Fortran, we'll need to use arrays and track the visited elements. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in set, maybe we can use a logical array or an array to track visited indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, 'used' is a set of integers, which are the indices being visited. 'idx' maps each index to its position in the traversal, and 'pos' maps the position to the index. So 'pos' is the sequence of indices visited, and 'idx' is the reverse mapping.\n\nSo the loop continues until 'next' is found in 'used'. Once found, the current step 'cur' minus idx[next] gives the cycle length 'a'. The 'b' is the index where the cycle starts.\n\nFortran's arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So need to adjust for that. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\n- N and K (K is a long in Java, so in Fortran, integer(kind=8))\n- A is an array of integers, each element is input minus 1. So in Fortran, read the input as integers, subtract 1.\n\nThen, used can be a logical array of size N, initialized to .false. Each time we visit next, mark used(next+1) as .true. because Fortran arrays are 1-based. Wait, in Java, next starts at 0. So in Fortran, the indices would be 1-based. Wait, no. The array A is 0-based in Java. So when they do A[next], which is 0-based. So when translating to Fortran, the indices would remain 0-based, but Fortran uses 1-based. Hmm, this might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the input elements are 1-based in the problem. Because in Java code, they subtract 1 from each element. So the input is 1-based, and the code converts to 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can adjust the code.\n\nLet me think: in Fortran, when we read the array A, we subtract 1 from each element. So each element of A will be 0-based, pointing to the next index. So when we start with next = 0 (since Java starts at 0), in Fortran, that would be 0, but Fortran arrays are 1-based. Wait, perhaps we can treat the indices as 0-based in Fortran code, using variables, but the array A is stored as 1-based. Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, A is of size N, indices 0..N-1. Each element is 0-based. So when next is 0, A[0] gives the next index. So in Fortran, if we have A as 1-based (since that's the default), then to store the same data, each input element is subtracted by 1, but since Fortran is 1-based, the next indices would be 0-based. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, we can treat all indices as 0-based. But Fortran allows arrays to start at 0. So we can declare A with 0-based indexing. For example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:)\n...\nallocate(A(0:N-1))\n\nBut that's possible. So in the Fortran code, the indices can be 0-based, matching the Java code. That would make the translation easier.\n\nAlternatively, adjust all indices by 1. For example, in Java, next is 0, in Fortran, next is 1. But then the code would have to adjust all accesses to A, etc. It might be error-prone.\n\nProbably better to use 0-based arrays in Fortran where possible to match the Java code's logic.\n\nSo, first, read N and K.\n\nIn Fortran, reading K as an integer of kind=8 (since Java's long is 64-bit). So:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: K\n\nThen, read N, K, then read N integers into array A. Subtract 1 from each.\n\nThen, the variables used, idx, pos:\n\nIn Java, used is a HashSet of integers. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in set, we can use a logical array, say, 'used' of size 0 to N-1, initialized to .false. Each time we visit a next index, set used(next) to .true. and check if the next index is already in used.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nnext = 0 (initially)\ncur = 0\n\nwhile used does not contain next:\n\nSo, in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\nnext = 0\ncur = 0\ndo while (.not. used(next))\n   ...\nend do\n\nBut the used array must be properly initialized. Wait, in Java, the initial used is empty. So in the first iteration, next is 0, which is not in used, so we add it. So in Fortran, the used array is initialized to .false. and when we process next, we check if used(next) is .true.?\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is:\n\nInitially, used is empty. So the first next is 0. Check if used contains 0 (which is false). So enter the loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, the 'used' array is of size 0:N-1 (assuming N can be up to 1e5 or so). Each index is 0-based. So:\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: used\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: idx, pos\n...\nallocate(used(0:N-1), idx(0:N-1), pos(0:N-1))\nused = .false.\nidx = -1  ! initializing to -1 as a default\npos = -1\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nnext = 0\ncur = 0\n\ndo while (.not. used(next))\n   used(next) = .true.\n   idx(next) = cur\n   pos(cur) = next\n   next = A(next)\n   cur = cur + 1\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, when next is A[next], which is 0-based. So in Fortran, if A is 0-based, then A(next) gives the next index. So that's correct.\n\nOnce the loop breaks, we have found the cycle. The cycle starts at idx[next], and the cycle length is cur - idx[next]. Then a = cur - idx[next], b = idx[next].\n\nThen, compute ans:\n\nIf K is less than b, then ans is K. Else, compute (K - b) mod a + b. But since K is a large number (could be up to 1e12?), we need to handle that.\n\nBut in Java, the code computes ans as (10000 * a + K - b) % a + b. Wait, why multiply a by 10000? That's a bit confusing. Wait, the code says:\n\nans = (int) ((10000 * a + K - b) % a + b);\n\nWait, perhaps this is to avoid negative values when K - b is negative. Because modulo in Java can be negative if the dividend is negative. But multiplying by 10000*a? Hmm, maybe to ensure that the value is positive before applying mod. But perhaps the code is trying to compute (K - b) mod a, but handle cases where K is less than b. But the code has a check: if b > K, then ans = K. So perhaps that 10000*a is a way to add a multiple of a to make (K -b + 10000*a) positive before taking mod. But that's a bit of a hack. Alternatively, perhaps it's intended to compute (K - b) mod a, but adding a large multiple of a to ensure positivity.\n\nIn Fortran, the modulo function returns a non-negative result when the modulus is positive. So, for example, mod(negative, a) would return a value between 0 and a-1. So in Fortran, (K - b) mod a would be correct. Wait, no. Let me check: in Fortran, the MOD function returns a result with the same sign as the first argument. So if K - b is negative, MOD(K - b, a) would be negative. To get the positive modulo, we can use modulo(K - b, a), which returns a non-negative result.\n\nSo in the Java code, perhaps they are using that 10000*a to make sure that the value is positive. So the equivalent in Fortran would be to compute (K - b) modulo a, but using the modulo function that returns a non-negative value. So in Fortran, ans can be computed as modulo(K - b, a) + b. But if K < b, then ans is K.\n\nSo the code in Java has:\n\nans = (int) ((10000 * a + K - b) % a + b);\nif (b > K) ans = (int) K;\n\nBut why the 10000*a? Oh, perhaps it's a way to add a multiple of a to (K -b) to ensure that the value is positive. For example, 10000*a is a multiple of a, so adding it doesn't change the modulo result. So (K -b + 10000*a) mod a is same as (K -b) mod a. But in Java, mod can be negative. So perhaps this is a way to avoid negative numbers. But in Fortran, using the modulo function (with positive modulus) would give the correct non-negative remainder.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the general case where K >= b, we can compute ans = modulo(K - b, a) + b. But need to make sure that if K >= b, we compute this. If K < b, then ans is K.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (K < b) then\n    ans = K\nelse\n    ans = modulo(K - b, a) + b\nend if\n\nBut in Java code, the ans is computed as ((10000*a + K -b) % a) + b. Let's see:\n\n(10000*a + K -b) % a is equivalent to (K -b) % a. Because 10000*a mod a is zero. So the Java code's expression is equivalent to (K -b) mod a + b, but with possible negative mod. So in Java, the mod operator returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. So if (K -b) is negative, the mod would be negative. So adding a to make it positive. So, for example, (K -b) % a could be negative. So the Java code adds 10000*a to make the dividend positive. So (10000*a + K -b) is positive, then mod a gives a positive result. Then +b.\n\nBut in Fortran, using the modulo function would be better. So modulo(K -b, a) would give a result in [0, a-1], then add b. So ans = modulo(K -b, a) + b.\n\nBut also, the Java code has a check: if (b > K) ans = K. So that's when K is less than b, meaning that the answer is in the pre-cycle steps.\n\nSo putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nOnce we have a, b, K, then:\n\nif (K < b) then\n    ans = K\nelse\n    ans = modulo(K - b, a) + b\nend if\n\nThen, output pos(ans) + 1. Wait, in Java, pos is an array where pos[cur] = next. Then, ans is the index into pos. So in Fortran, pos is 0-based (since cur starts at 0). So pos is an array from 0 to cur-1. So ans can be up to cur-1.\n\nBut in Fortran, the pos array would be declared as (0:max_size). So after the loop, the pos array has entries from 0 to cur-1. So when ans is determined, we look up pos(ans) (0-based) and add 1 to convert to 1-based for output.\n\nWait, in Java code, the output is pos[ans] +1. Because the problem's output is 1-based. For example, if pos[ans] is 0, output is 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing ans, we take pos(ans) (0-based) and add 1.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling large N. The Java code uses N up to 1e6+1. So in Fortran, need to allocate arrays of size N. So in Fortran, the code should use dynamic allocation.\n\n- The variables a and b are computed as (cur - idx[next]) and idx[next]. But idx is an array of size N (0-based). So next is the current index where the cycle is detected.\n\n- Need to find next in the used set, which in Fortran is handled by the loop condition.\n\nNow, let's outline the code step by step.\n\n1. Read N and K.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: N\ninteger(kind=8) :: K\nread(*, *) N, K\n\n2. Read array A and subtract 1 from each element.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:)\nallocate(A(0:N-1))  ! 0-based array\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    read(*, *) temp\n    A(i) = temp -1\nend do\n\n3. Initialize variables:\n\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\ninteger, allocatable :: idx(:), pos(:)\ninteger :: cur, next\ninteger :: i, ans_pos\ninteger(kind=8) :: a, b, ans\n\nallocate(used(0:N-1))\nallocate(idx(0:N-1))\nallocate(pos(0:N-1))\n\nused = .false.\nidx = -1\npos = -1\n\ncur = 0\nnext = 0\n\nloop until used(next) is true:\n\ndo while (.not. used(next))\n    used(next) = .true.\n    idx(next) = cur\n    pos(cur) = next\n    next = A(next)\n    cur = cur + 1\nend do\n\nAt this point, next is the index where the cycle starts. So:\n\na = cur - idx(next)\nb = idx(next)\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nif (K < b) then\n    ans = K\nelse\n    ans = b + modulo(K - b, a)\nend if\n\nBut ans must be within the pos array. pos has indices from 0 to cur-1. Since ans is computed as up to b + a -1, which is (cur - idx(next) ) + idx(next) -1 = cur -1, which is valid.\n\nThen, the answer is pos(ans) +1.\n\nSo:\n\nans_pos = pos(ans) + 1\nprint *, ans_pos\n\nBut in Fortran, ans is of type integer(kind=8) (since K is big), but pos is an integer array. So need to make sure ans is within the bounds of pos.\n\nBut since ans is computed as up to cur-1, and pos is allocated up to N-1 (but in the loop, cur increments until a cycle is found, so cur can be up to N before the loop exits). Wait, no: in the loop, used(next) is checked. Once a next is found in used, the loop exits. So cur can be up to N steps. But pos is allocated as 0:N-1. Wait, no: in Fortran, we allocated pos(0:N-1), but if cur exceeds N, then pos(cur) would be out of bounds. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, the Java code uses pos array of size N, which may be filled up to cur. But in Fortran, if we allocate pos(0:N-1), and cur can be up to N steps (for example, when the entire sequence is a cycle of length N), then when cur reaches N, pos(N-1) is written, then next = A[next], which may be 0 (if the cycle is N steps). So the loop may exit when cur is N. So the pos array needs to be of size 0:cur_max_possible. But in the worst case, cur can be N+1? Wait, let's think: in the loop, each iteration increases cur by 1, and starts with next=0. The loop stops when next is in used. The maximum possible number of iterations is N+1? Because after N steps, all nodes are visited (since there are N nodes). So cur can be up to N. So the pos array needs to have indices up to N. So in Java, the code initializes pos as new int[N], which can be up to N-1. But in the code, when cur is up to N, pos[cur] would be out of bounds. Wait, but in Java, the array is allocated as new int[N], so indices 0..N-1. So when cur reaches N, pos[cur] = next would be out of bounds. But in the Java code, how does that not cause an error?\n\nWait, perhaps the loop must terminate before cur reaches N. Because there are N elements. Since each step adds a new element to the set, after N steps, all elements are in the set. So when next is computed, it must have been already in the set. So the loop would terminate after at most N steps. So cur can be up to N, but in the pos array of size N (indices 0..N-1), when cur reaches N, pos[cur] would be pos[N], which is out of bounds. So there's a bug in the Java code? Or perhaps the loop runs correctly.\n\nWait, let's see the Java code:\n\nint idx[] = new int[N]; // size N, indices 0..N-1\n\nint pos[] = new int[N];\n\nnext starts at 0.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nwhile (!used.contains(next)) { // first iteration: next=0, not in used.\n\nused.add(next); // add 0\n\nidx[next] = cur; // idx[0] = 0\n\npos[cur] = next; // pos[0] =0\n\nnext = A[next]; // next becomes A[0]\n\ncur++; // cur is now 1.\n\nThe loop continues until next is found in used. Since there are N elements, and each iteration adds a new element to used, the loop can run at most N times. So cur can be up to N. So when cur is N, pos[N-1] is set. Then next is computed again, and if it's in used, the loop stops. So in Java, the pos array is size N, which can handle cur up to N-1. So in the case where the loop runs N times, cur becomes N, but then the loop stops. So the code in Java does not have an out of bounds error.\n\nSo in Fortran, the pos array needs to be of size 0:N-1. But when cur reaches N, then pos is written to pos(N-1) at cur = N-1. Then next is computed, and the loop exits. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think of N=3. The loop runs:\n\ncur starts at 0.\n\nLoop:\n\nnext is 0, not in used.\n\nused.add(0), idx[0]=0, pos[0]=0.\n\nnext = A[0], cur becomes 1.\n\nThen, check if next (A[0]) is in used. Suppose not.\n\nused.add(A[0]), idx[A[0]]=1, pos[1] = A[0].\n\nnext = A[A[0]], cur becomes 2.\n\nCheck again. Suppose not in used.\n\nThen pos[2] = next. cur becomes 3.\n\nCheck again. Now, next is A[A[A[0]]]. Suppose it is in used (like, if it's 0 again). Then loop stops. So cur is 3. So the pos array is filled up to pos[2] (since cur runs from 0 to 2, then increments to 3 and stops). So pos has size N (3), indices 0-2. So no problem.\n\nSo in Java, the pos array is size N, which can handle cur up to N-1. So in Fortran, when we allocate pos(0:N-1), that's correct.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran is safe.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nPotential code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N\n    integer(kind=8) :: K\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: used(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: idx(:), pos(:)\n    integer :: cur, next_val, temp, i\n    integer(kind=8) :: a, b, ans\n\n    ! Read N and K\n    read(*, *) N, K\n\n    ! Allocate A as 0-based\n    allocate(A(0:N-1))\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        read(*, *) temp\n        A(i) = temp - 1  ! convert to 0-based\n    end do\n\n    ! Allocate used, idx, pos as 0-based arrays\n    allocate(used(0:N-1))\n    allocate(idx(0:N-1))\n    allocate(pos(0:N-1))\n\n    used = .false.\n    idx = -1\n    pos = -1\n\n    cur = 0\n    next_val = 0  ! initial next is 0\n\n    do while (.not. used(next_val))\n        used(next_val) = .true.\n        idx(next_val) = cur\n        pos(cur) = next_val\n        next_val = A(next_val)\n        cur = cur + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, compute a and b\n    a = cur - idx(next_val)\n    b = idx(next_val)\n\n    ! Compute ans\n    if (K < b) then\n        ans = K\n    else\n        ans = b + modulo(K - b, a)\n    end if\n\n    ! Output pos(ans) + 1\n    print *, pos(ans) + 1\n\n    deallocate(A)\n    deallocate(used)\n    deallocate(idx)\n    deallocate(pos)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables like a and b are integers. So in the code above, a and b are declared as integer(kind=8), which matches K's type.\n\nAlso, 'ans' is computed as an integer(kind=8) because K can be up to 1e18. But when using ans as an index into pos, which is a regular integer (4 bytes), but since pos is 0-based up to N-1, and N is up to 1e6, ans would fit in a 4-byte integer. So perhaps in Fortran, ans can be integer(kind=8) as well, but when accessing pos(ans), it's okay as long as ans is within the array bounds.\n\nAnother thing: when K is up to 1e18, but the code computes ans as modulo (K - b, a). But a can be up to N (which is 1e6), so ans is up to N-1 + N, which is 2e6, which fits in 4-byte integers.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array indices must be integers of the default kind, which is typically 4 bytes. So ans should be of type integer (4 bytes). But K is 8-byte. So when K is very large, converting to integer(4) could cause overflow. So we need to ensure that ans is within the range of 4-byte integers. But since ans is computed as modulo (K - b, a) + b, and a is up to N (1e6), and b up to N, ans is up to 1e6 + 1e6 = 2e6, which is within the 4-byte integer range (up to 2^31-1 ~ 2e9). So no problem.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you assign an integer(kind=8) to a variable of type integer (kind=4), it can cause truncation. So in the code above, ans is declared as integer(kind=8). But when used as an index in pos(ans), which is declared as integer(4) array, the code may have issues. So perhaps we should declare ans as integer. But how?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variable types must match when used as indices. So if ans is integer(kind=8), and pos is declared as integer(4) array, then pos(ans) would be allowed if the compiler supports it, but perhaps it's better to cast ans to default integer.\n\nBut in the code above, 'ans' is computed as integer(kind=8). So when ans is within the bounds of pos (0 to N-1), which is up to 1e6, then converting it to a default integer is safe.\n\nSo in the code, after computing ans as integer(kind=8), cast it to integer when accessing pos.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't directly index with integer(kind=8) variables if the compiler doesn't support it. So perhaps the code should declare ans as integer.\n\nBut how to handle large K? For example, K can be up to 1e18. So when K is cast to integer (4-byte), it can overflow. So we need to keep ans as integer(kind=8) and then cast it to integer when accessing the array.\n\nBut Fortran allows for indexing arrays with integer(kind=8) variables if the compiler supports it. However, some compilers may not support this. So to be safe, perhaps we can compute ans as integer(kind=8), then convert to default integer (kind=4) when accessing pos. But this is risky if ans is larger than 2e9. However, in this problem's constraints, ans is up to 2e6, which is safe.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nans is declared as integer(kind=8), and when accessing pos(ans), we can use int(ans, 4) if necessary. But perhaps in Fortran, it's allowed to use a 8-byte integer as an index. Let me check.\n\nYes, in Fortran, the index can be of any integer kind as long as it is within the array's bounds. So if ans is 8-byte, and pos is declared as integer(4), then ans is within the 4-byte range, so it's allowed.\n\nSo the code above should work.\n\nTesting with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n3 1 2 5 4\n\nIn Java code:\n\nA is read as [3-1=2, 1-1=0, 2-1=1, 5-1=4,4-1=3]. So A = [2,0,1,4,3].\n\nThe steps:\n\nnext starts at 0.\n\ncur=0:\n\nused[0] = false. Process.\n\nused[0] = true.\n\nidx[0] =0.\n\npos[0] =0.\n\nnext becomes A[0] =2.\n\ncur=1.\n\nnext=2: not used.\n\nused[2]=true.\n\nidx[2] =1.\n\npos[1]=2.\n\nnext=A[2] =1.\n\ncur=2.\n\nnext=1: not used.\n\nused[1] = true.\n\nidx[1] =2.\n\npos[2] =1.\n\nnext =A[1] =0.\n\ncur=3.\n\nnext=0: already used (true). So loop breaks.\n\na = cur - idx[next] =3 -0=3.\n\nb=0.\n\nK=2.\n\nSince K >=b (0), ans =0 + (2-0) mod3 \u2192 (2 mod3) \u2192 2. So ans=0+2=2.\n\npos[2] is 1. So output 1+1=2.\n\nBut sample input's expected output? I'm not sure. But this is the logic.\n\nBut perhaps I should run through the code.\n\nBut the code should be correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly handle this case.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nFor example, the sample input where the sequence is 0\u21922\u21921\u21920, so the cycle starts at 0, with a=3.\n\nBut I think the code is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code as written should work."
