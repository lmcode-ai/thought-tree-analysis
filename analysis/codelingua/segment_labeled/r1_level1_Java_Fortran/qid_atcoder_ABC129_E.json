So the steps for each i (1..n) in Fortran:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nif current_char == '0' then\n\n   dp(i, 0) = dp(i-1, 0)\n\n   dp(i, 1) = dp(i-1, 1)\n\nelse\n\n   dp(i, 1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nend if\n\nthen, another if:\n\nif current_char == '0' then\n\n   temp = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n   dp(i, 1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp, M)\n\nelse\n\n   temp0 = mod(dp(i-1, 0) * 2, M)\n\n   temp1 = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + temp0, M)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp1, M)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the character is '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and [1], then in the second part, adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. But in Fortran's indexing, when processing i (the current step), the previous state is i-1. So for example, in Java:\n\nwhen s[i] is '0', the first part is:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nthen the second part adds to dp[i+1][1] (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M.\n\nSo in Fortran, for i (current step), the previous is i-1. So during the second part, when the character is '0', the code adds (dp(i-1, 1) * 2) mod M to dp(i, 1). Then mod again. Similarly for the other case. So the Fortran code for each i (1 to n) would be:\n\ncharacter current_char current_char = s(i) if (current_char == '0') then\n\n    ! First part\n\n    dp(i, 0) = dp(i-1, 0)\n\n    dp(i, 1) = dp(i-1, 1)\n\nelse\n\n    ! First part: set dp(i,1) to sum of previous 0 and 1\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nend if\n\n! Then the second part\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    add_val = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + add_val, M)\n\nelse\n\n    add_val0 = mod(dp(i-1,0) * 2, M)\n\n    add_val1 = mod(dp(i-1,1) * 2, M)\n\n    dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + add_val0, M)\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + add_val1, M)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the second part for '0' is:\n\ndp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2) % M) % M; So in the Java code, during the second part, for '0', they take the current value of dp[i+1][1] (which was set in the first part) and add (dp[i][1] *2) mod M, then mod M again.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe problem seems to involve dynamic programming. The code reads a binary string and processes each character to compute some value modulo 1e9+7. \n\nLooking at the variables: there's a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1)x2. Each step updates dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] based on the current character (0 or 1). The main operations involve conditional checks on the current character and updating the dp values with modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle the input. In Java, they read a line and convert it to a char array. In Fortran, I can read the input as a string and process each character. \n\nFortran uses 1-based indexing by default, so I need to adjust the loops accordingly. The original code loops from i=0 to n-1 (since i < n), which in Fortran would be i=1 to n. \n\nThe dp array in Java is (n+1) x 2. In Fortran, I can declare it as dp(n+1, 0:1), perhaps. Wait, Fortran arrays can start at any index. Maybe it's easier to have it as (0:n, 0:1). Hmm, but in the Java code, the first index goes up to n. So in Fortran, the first dimension can be 0 to n, and the second 0 to 1. \n\nInitialization: dp[0][0] = 1. So in Fortran, dp(0,0) = 1. Then for each i from 0 to n-1 (which in Fortran would be from 1 to n?), wait no. Wait, the loop in Java is i from 0 to n-1. Because the original string is length n. So for each character in the string (each s[i]), they compute the next dp[i+1][...]. So for i in 0..n-1 (Java), which would be i=1 to n in Fortran if the string is processed from 1 to n. Wait, perhaps not. Let me see: in Java, the loop is for (i=0; i < n; i++). So in Fortran, the loop would be do i = 1, n. But the string in Java is 0-based. So the Fortran code will process each character from 1 to n. \n\nSo first, read the input string. Let's see: the Java code reads the line, converts to char array. So in Fortran, read into a character variable, then loop over each character. \n\nNow, about dynamic programming transitions. Let's look at the code. \n\nIf s[i] is '0', then dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], and dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]. Then, there's another part where if s[i] is '0', add dp[i][1] * 2 to dp[i+1][1], modulo M. Else, for the other part, they add to dp[i+1][0] and [1] based on doubling. \n\nWait, the code structure is:\n\nfor each i:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\nThen, regardless of the character, another if-else:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += dp[i][1] * 2 mod M\n\n    then mod M again\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += dp[i][0] * 2 mod M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += dp[i][1] * 2 mod M\n\n    then mod M for both\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe code after the first conditional (if s[i] is '0') block, then there's another if statement:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    ... similar for adding to 0 and 1.\n\nSo the code is doing two separate updates. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Depending on the current character, set some initial values for dp[i+1][0] and [1].\n\n2. Then, depending on the same character, add more values to these entries, again with modulo.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. \n\nNow, handling the dp array. Since Fortran doesn't allow dynamic allocation in the same way as Java, but since we can read the input first, then get the length n, we can allocate the dp array accordingly. \n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read the input string. \n\n- Get n as the length of the string.\n\n- Initialize dp(0:n, 0:1) with initial values 0, except dp(0,0) = 1.\n\nThen loop over each character from 1 to n (since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran, the first character is at index 1). Wait, no. Wait, the input string in Java is s[0..n-1], and the loop runs i from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, the string can be processed from 1 to n. So s(1) is the first character, s(2) the second, etc., up to s(n). \n\nSo for each i in 1..n:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nThen compute the transitions for dp(i, 0:1) based on dp(i-1, 0:1). Wait, no. Because in Java, the loop is i (Java) from 0 to n-1, and the next state is i+1. So in Fortran terms, for each step in the loop (i from 1 to n), we are computing dp(i, ...) based on dp(i-1, ...). So perhaps the indices in Fortran are adjusted. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's dp[i+1][x] is computed based on dp[i][y]. So when i is the current index (0..n-1), i+1 is the next. So in Fortran, if the loop runs for i=1 to n, then each step is processing the ith character, and updating the i+1th dp entry. Wait, that would require the dp array to be 0-based? Or maybe in Fortran, it's easier to adjust the indices. Let's think.\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n   process s[i], update dp[i+1][...]\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, we can loop from i = 1 to n (since the string in Fortran is s(1:n)), and update dp(i, ...) based on dp(i-1, ...). Because when i is 1, we are processing the first character and updating dp(1+1? No, wait: in Java, the first iteration (i=0) computes dp[1][...] from dp[0][...]. So in Fortran, perhaps the loop is from i=1 to n, and for each, compute dp(i, ...) based on the previous step (i-1). Wait, but in Java, the loop is over the original indices, and the next state is i+1. So in Fortran, perhaps the loop runs from i=1 to n, and each step computes dp(i, ...) based on dp(i-1, ...). But in that case, the final answer would be dp(n, 0) + dp(n, 1). Which matches the Java code's dp[n][0] + dp[n][1].\n\nSo the indices in Fortran can be 0-based or 1-based. Let's see. Let's make the dp array in Fortran as 0:n for the first dimension (like Java's 0..n) and 0:1 for the second. So dp(0:n, 0:1). Then, the loop runs for i from 0 to n-1 (since n is the length of the string). But the original code's i runs from 0 to n-1 (since i < n). Wait, in Java, the string is length n, so the loop runs n times, for i from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, the loop should run from i=1 to n (since the string is from 1 to n). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's re-express:\n\nJava code:\n\ns is a char array of length n.\n\nfor (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n   process s[i] and compute dp[i+1][...] based on dp[i][...]\n\nSo in Fortran, the string is s(1:n). So for each i in 1..n (Fortran), we are processing s(i), and compute dp(i, ...) based on dp(i-1, ...). Then, after processing all n characters, the answer is dp(n, 0) + dp(n, 1). So the Fortran loop would be from i=1 to n. But in that case, the initial dp(0, 0) is 1, and the rest are 0. Then, for each i from 1 to n, compute dp(i, ...) based on dp(i-1, ...).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me reindex:\n\nIn Java, the current index is i, and the next is i+1. So for each step i, we compute the next state (i+1). So in Fortran, perhaps the loop runs over i from 1 to n, and for each i, we are computing the dp for i based on i-1. That way, after processing all n steps, the answer is dp(n, 0) + dp(n, 1). That would align with the Java code's approach.\n\nYes. So the Java code's dp[i+1] becomes Fortran's dp(i), and the current character is s[i] (Java) which is s(i) in Fortran. So the loop in Fortran would run for i from 1 to n (Fortran's loop variables), and for each i, the character is s(i), and dp(i, ...) is computed from dp(i-1, ...).\n\nSo in Fortran, the dp array is 0:n, 0:1. The initial condition is dp(0,0) = 1, others are 0. Then, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif s(i) is '0':\n\n    set dp(i, 0) = dp(i-1, 0)\n\n    set dp(i, 1) = dp(i-1, 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    set dp(i, 1) = (dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1)) mod M\n\nThen, another part where:\n\nif s(i) is '0':\n\n    add (dp(i-1,1)*2) mod M to dp(i,1)\n\n    then mod M again\n\nelse:\n\n    add (dp(i-1,0)*2) mod M to dp(i,0)\n\n    add (dp(i-1,1)*2) mod M to dp(i,1)\n\n    mod each by M\n\nSo the Fortran code must replicate these steps. Also, note that in the first part, when the character is not '0', the code sets dp[i+1][1] = sum of the previous 0 and 1. But then, in the second part, depending on the character, additional terms are added. \n\nBut in the Java code, after the first part, the second part checks the same character again. So in Fortran, for each i, after the initial setting, another set of operations based on s(i) is done.\n\nSo the steps for each i (1..n) in Fortran:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nif current_char == '0' then\n\n   dp(i, 0) = dp(i-1, 0)\n\n   dp(i, 1) = dp(i-1, 1)\n\nelse\n\n   dp(i, 1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nend if\n\nthen, another if:\n\nif current_char == '0' then\n\n   temp = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n   dp(i, 1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp, M)\n\nelse\n\n   temp0 = mod(dp(i-1, 0) * 2, M)\n\n   temp1 = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + temp0, M)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp1, M)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the character is '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and [1], then in the second part, adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. But in Fortran's indexing, when processing i (the current step), the previous state is i-1.\n\nSo for example, in Java:\n\nwhen s[i] is '0', the first part is:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nthen the second part adds to dp[i+1][1] (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M.\n\nSo in Fortran, for i (current step), the previous is i-1. So during the second part, when the character is '0', the code adds (dp(i-1, 1) * 2) mod M to dp(i, 1). Then mod again.\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nSo the Fortran code for each i (1 to n) would be:\n\ncharacter current_char\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    ! First part\n\n    dp(i, 0) = dp(i-1, 0)\n\n    dp(i, 1) = dp(i-1, 1)\n\nelse\n\n    ! First part: set dp(i,1) to sum of previous 0 and 1\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nend if\n\n! Then the second part\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    add_val = mod(dp(i-1, 1) * 2, M)\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + add_val, M)\n\nelse\n\n    add_val0 = mod(dp(i-1,0) * 2, M)\n\n    add_val1 = mod(dp(i-1,1) * 2, M)\n\n    dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + add_val0, M)\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + add_val1, M)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the second part for '0' is:\n\ndp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2) % M) % M;\n\nSo in the Java code, during the second part, for '0', they take the current value of dp[i+1][1] (which was set in the first part) and add (dp[i][1] *2) mod M, then mod M again.\n\nIn the Fortran code, after the first part, the second part for '0' would take dp(i,1) (from the first part) and add (dp(i-1,1) *2) mod M, then mod again.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, initializing the dp array. Initially, dp(0,0) = 1, all others are 0. So in Fortran, we can initialize the entire array to 0, then set dp(0,0) = 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables are not automatically initialized. So we need to set them to 0. So:\n\ninteger :: dp(0:n, 0:1)\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\nThen loop from i=1 to n.\n\nNow, handling the input. In Fortran, the input is read as a character variable. So:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s  ! assuming maximum input length, but better to adjust.\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nn = len_trim(s)  ! assuming no trailing spaces, but if the input is read properly, maybe.\n\nWait, but in Java, the sc.nextLine() reads the entire line, including any leading or trailing characters except the newline. So in Fortran, reading with '(a)' will read the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. So len_trim(s) will give the actual length.\n\nWait, but len_trim returns the position of the last non-blank character. So if the input is like '101 ', with trailing spaces, len_trim would be 3. But the Java code uses s.length(), which is the actual array length. So perhaps in Fortran, we need to read the entire line, and then process all characters, including any trailing spaces. But the problem likely expects that the input is a binary string with no spaces. So perhaps the code should take the entire line as the string, and n is the length of that line. But in Fortran, when you read a line into a character variable, the variable's length is fixed. So if the variable is declared as, say, character(len=100000) :: s, then when you read a line shorter than 100000, the remaining characters are filled with spaces. So to get the actual length of the input line, you need to find the first newline or the position of the last non-space character. But in Java, the code reads the entire line, including any spaces. So perhaps in the problem, the input is a binary string with only '0's and '1's, no spaces. So len_trim(s) gives the correct length. Alternatively, we can process all characters until the first space or newline. But this may complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, we can read the line into a variable and then loop through each character until the end of the string. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in way to find the actual input length. So perhaps use len_trim(s), which gives the position of the last non-blank character. So the code would be:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nThen, process characters from 1 to n.\n\nBut if the input has leading or trailing spaces, len_trim would return the correct length. But according to the problem statement, the input is a binary string, so likely no spaces. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n\n    integer :: n, i\n\n    integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n\n    n = len_trim(s)\n\n    allocate(dp(0:n, 0:1))\n\n    dp = 0\n\n    dp(0,0) = 1\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n            ! First part: set current 0 and 1 from previous\n\n            dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n            dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n        else\n\n            ! First part: set current 1 to sum of previous 0 and 1\n\n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\n        end if\n\n        ! Second part\n\n        if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n            ! Add dp_prev_1 * 2 to current 1\n\n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + mod(dp(i-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n\n        else\n\n            ! Add dp_prev_0 *2 to current 0 and dp_prev_1 *2 to current 1\n\n            dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + mod(dp(i-1,0) * 2, M), M)\n\n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + mod(dp(i-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, mod(dp(n,0) + dp(n,1), M)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first part and the second part are separate. For example, when the character is '0', after the first part, the second part adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. But in the Fortran code, during the first part, the code is using dp(i-1, ...) which is the previous step. So that's correct.\n\nWait, let's test the code with a simple example. Let's take input \"1\". Then n=1.\n\nInitialization: dp(0,0)=1, others 0.\n\nLoop i=1:\n\ns(1) is '1'.\n\nFirst part: else clause. dp(1,1) = (dp(0,0)+dp(0,1)) mod M = 1+0=1.\n\nSecond part: else clause. add to dp(1,0) and dp(1,1) the previous * 2.\n\nPrevious dp(0,0) is 1. So 1*2=2 mod M is 2.\n\nSo dp(1,0) was initially 0 (since first part didn't touch it). Now add 2: 0+2=2 mod M.\n\ndp(1,1) was 1. Previous dp(0,1) was 0. 0*2=0. So add 0: 1 +0=1 mod M.\n\nSo after processing, dp(1,0)=2, dp(1,1)=1.\n\nThe answer is (2 + 1) mod M =3.\n\nBut according to the Java code, what would be the result for input \"1\"?\n\nLet's simulate the Java code.\n\ns = {'1'}, n=1.\n\ndp is (n+1)=2 rows.\n\nInitial dp[0][0] =1, others 0.\n\nLoop i=0:\n\ns[0] is '1'.\n\nFirst part: else clause. dp[1][1] = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1}) % M = 1 +0=1.\n\nSecond part: else clause.\n\ndp[1][0] += (dp[0][0] *2) % M \u2192 0 + 2 \u2192 2 mod M.\n\ndp[1][1] += (dp[0][1] *2) \u2192 1 +0 \u21921.\n\nSo dp[1][0]=2, dp[1][1}=1.\n\nSum is 3, which matches the Fortran code.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0\". Then:\n\nJava code:\n\ndp[0][0]=1.\n\ni=0, s[0] is '0'.\n\nFirst part: dp[1][0] = dp[0][0} =1, dp[1][1} =0.\n\nSecond part: s[0] is '0', so add (dp[0][1} *2) mod M \u21920. So dp[1][1} becomes 0+0=0.\n\nSum is 1 +0=1.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=1, s(1)='0'.\n\nFirst part: dp(1,0)=1, dp(1,1)=0.\n\nSecond part: add (dp(0,1) *2) mod M \u21920. So dp(1,1) =0+0=0.\n\nSum is 1+0=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"10\".\n\nJava code:\n\nn=2.\n\ni=0 (s[0] = '1'):\n\nFirst part: dp[1][1] = 1.\n\nSecond part: add to dp[1][0} 2 (from 1*2). So dp[1][0}=2, dp[1][1} =1 (from 1 +0).\n\ni=1 (s[1]='0'):\n\nFirst part: dp[2][0} = dp[1][0} =2. dp[2][1} = dp[1][1} =1.\n\nSecond part: s[1] is '0', so add (dp[1][1} *2) \u21921*2=2. So dp[2][1} becomes 1 +2 =3.\n\nSum is 2+3=5.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=1, s(1)='1':\n\ndp(1,0) =0, dp(1,1)=1 after first part.\n\nSecond part: add 2 and 0 \u2192 dp(1,0}=2, dp(1,1}=1.\n\ni=2, s(2)='0'.\n\nFirst part: dp(2,0}=2, dp(2,1}=1.\n\nSecond part: add (dp(1,1} *2) \u21922 \u2192 dp(2,1} becomes 1+2=3.\n\nSum 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, handling the allocation. The variable s is read with a length of 100000. But if the input is longer than that, the code would fail. However, in practice, for programming competition problems, the maximum input size is known. So assuming that 1e5 is enough.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran requires that variables be declared before executable statements. So the code structure is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as written."
