  "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer N, then reads N integers into an array A. It then computes two arrays, L and R. L[i] is the GCD of all elements from A[0] to A[i], and R[i] is the GCD from A[i] to A[N-1]. Then, the answer is the maximum GCD obtained by either taking the GCD of all elements except the last one (L[N-2]), or all except the first (R[1]), or for the middle elements, taking the GCD of L[i-1] and R[i+1] where you skip the i-th element. Finally, the maximum of these values is printed.\n\nSo the key steps are: read input, compute prefix GCDs (L), compute suffix GCDs (R), then find the maximum possible GCD when excluding each element.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about how Fortran handles arrays and loops. \n\nFirst, Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default, but the original Java code uses 0-based. So I need to adjust all array indices. For example, in Java, A is 0 to N-1; in Fortran, it should be 1 to N. Similarly, the L and R arrays will be from 1 to N. \n\nThe first step is to read N and then the array A. In Fortran, that would be using READ statements. Then, compute L and R arrays. \n\nFor the L array: L(1) is A(1). For i from 2 to N, L(i) = gcd(L(i-1), A(i)). \n\nFor the R array: R(N) is A(N). For i from N-1 down to 1, R(i) = gcd(R(i+1), A(i)). \n\nThen, the answer starts as the maximum between L(N-1) (since in Java L[N-2] would be the second to last element in 0-based, which in Fortran's 1-based is L(N-1)), and R(2) (since Java R[1] is the second element in 0-based, which in 1-based is R(2)).\n\nThen, for the middle elements, iterate from i=2 to N-1 (since in Java it's i from 1 to N-2, but again adjusting for 1-based). For each i, compute gcd(L(i-1), R(i+1)) and compare to the current maximum.\n\nThe GCD function in Fortran. The Java code has a gcd function that swaps a and b if necessary, then uses the Euclidean algorithm. We can replicate this in Fortran with a function or subroutine. Since Fortran passes arguments by reference, but in this case, since we are modifying a and b inside, maybe a function that takes a and b as input and returns the gcd.\n\nWait, the Java function takes a and b, possibly swaps them, then does the Euclidean loop. Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\npublic static int gcd(int a, int b) {\n    int tmp;\n    if (b > a) { swap a and b }\n    if (b ==0) return a;\n    then do the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nIn Fortran, the function can take a and b as inputs. But since in Fortran, parameters are passed by reference, so modifying them inside the function would change the original variables. But in our case, the Java code uses a and b as local variables. So perhaps in the Fortran function, we need to copy the input parameters into local variables to avoid modifying the original.\n\nSo the Fortran function would be something like:\n\ninteger function gcd(a, b)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer :: ta, tb, tmp, r\n\n    ta = a\n    tb = b\n\n    if (tb > ta) then\n        tmp = ta\n        ta = tb\n        tb = tmp\n    endif\n\n    if (tb == 0) then\n        gcd = ta\n        return\n    endif\n\n    r = mod(ta, tb)\n    do while (r /= 0)\n        ta = tb\n        tb = r\n        r = mod(ta, tb)\n    end do\n\n    gcd = tb\nend function gcd\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after swapping, they check if b is 0. If yes, return a. Then they proceed to compute a % b. Wait, but after swapping, a is the larger one. So perhaps the Fortran code can be written as follows.\n\nWait, let's re-express the Java gcd function:\n\npublic static int gcd(int a, int b) {\n    int tmp;\n    if (b > a) { swap a and b }\n    if (b ==0) return a;\n    do {\n        r = a % b;\n        a = b;\n        b = r;\n    } while (r !=0);\n    return a;\n}\n\nWait, in the Java code, after swapping, if b is zero, return a. Then, the loop starts by calculating r = a % b. But if b is not zero, then the loop continues until r is zero, then returns a (since after the loop, b would be zero, and a is the GCD). \n\nWait, let's test with an example. Suppose a=12, b=8. After swapping, since b is not larger than a. Then, since b is 8, not zero. Then, r = 12 % 8 is 4. Then a becomes 8, b becomes 4. Next loop: r=8%4=0. Now r is zero, loop exits. Return a (8). Which is wrong, because GCD(12,8) is 4. Hmm, so perhaps there's a bug in the Java code's gcd function.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see. Let's take a=12, b=8. Since b is not larger than a, so no swap. Then, since b is not zero. r=12%8=4. Then a=8, b=4. Loop again, r=8%4=0. Then a=4, b=0. Now r is zero, loop exits. The function returns a, which is 4. Which is correct. Oh right, because in each iteration, r is calculated, then a and b are updated. So the loop continues while r !=0. So when r becomes zero, the loop stops, and the GCD is in b (but wait, after r becomes zero, the loop stops. So the last iteration was when r was not zero. Let's see:\n\nWait, the loop is do { ... } while (r !=0). So first, compute r = a % b. Then, a becomes b, b becomes r. Then check if r is not zero to continue.\n\nSo, in the case of a=8, b=4:\n\nr = 8%4=0. So a becomes 4, b becomes 0. Then check if r !=0 (0 is not), so loop stops. Then return a (4). So that's correct.\n\nSo the Java code's gcd function works correctly.\n\nSo the Fortran version should mirror this logic. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, the function would take a and b as inputs, and return the gcd.\n\nBut let's think about the parameters. Let's say in Fortran:\n\ninteger function gcd(a, b)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer :: ta, tb, r\n\n    ta = a\n    tb = b\n\n    if (tb > ta) then\n        call swap(ta, tb)\n    end if\n\n    if (tb == 0) then\n        gcd = ta\n        return\n    end if\n\n    r = mod(ta, tb)\n    do while (r /= 0)\n        ta = tb\n        tb = r\n        r = mod(ta, tb)\n    end do\n\n    gcd = tb\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine swap(x, y)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: x, y\n        integer :: tmp\n        tmp = x\n        x = y\n        y = tmp\n    end subroutine swap\n\nend function gcd\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can't have internal subroutines like that. So perhaps better to do the swap manually.\n\nAlternatively, write the swap inline.\n\nSo, inside the function:\n\nif (tb > ta) then\n    tmp = ta\n    ta = tb\n    tb = tmp\nendif\n\nBut Fortran uses 'intent(in)' for a and b, so we need to work with copies. So ta and tb are copies of a and b. Then, proceed.\n\nSo the function would look like:\n\ninteger function gcd(a, b)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer :: ta, tb, tmp, r\n\n    ta = a\n    tb = b\n\n    if (tb > ta) then\n        tmp = ta\n        ta = tb\n        tb = tmp\n    endif\n\n    if (tb == 0) then\n        gcd = ta\n        return\n    endif\n\n    r = mod(ta, tb)\n    do while (r /= 0)\n        ta = tb\n        tb = r\n        r = mod(ta, tb)\n    end do\n\n    gcd = tb\nend function gcd\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the loop, the GCD is a. But in the Fortran code above, after the loop, the GCD would be tb. Let's see why.\n\nJava code:\n\nAfter the loop (which runs while r !=0), returns a. Let's see with example:\n\nInitial a=12, b=8. After the loop:\n\nFirst iteration: r=4, a becomes 8, b becomes4. r is 4 !=0 \u2192 loop again.\n\nSecond iteration: r=0, a becomes4, b becomes0. loop exits. returns a, which is4.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nta starts as 12, tb as 8.\n\nr=mod(12,8) =4. So r=4 !=0 \u2192 enter loop.\n\nta becomes8, tb becomes4.\n\nr=mod(8,4)=0 \u2192 loop exits. So return tb, which is4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=0. Java code returns6. Fortran function: tb is0, so returns ta=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=15. So Java code swaps a and b to 15 and5. Then check if b=5 !=0. r=15%5=0. Loop exits. Return a=15? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, after swapping, a=15, b=5. Then since b is not zero, compute r=15%5=0. Then a becomes5, b becomes0. Then loop exits, returns a=5. Which is correct, GCD(5,15) is5.\n\nSo the Java code returns a after the loop. But in the Fortran code, the loop ends when r is zero, and returns tb. Let's see:\n\nIn the above example:\n\nta=15, tb=5.\n\nr = mod(15,5) =0 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So returns tb, which is5. Correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the Fortran code, after initial setup, r is computed as mod(ta,tb). If that's zero, then the loop is not entered, and tb is returned.\n\nSo in the case where a and b are divisible, the code returns tb. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=12, b=6. Then, after setup, r is zero. So returns tb=6. Correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code's logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to the main program.\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared. So N is integer. The array A is dimension N. Then L and R are arrays of the same size.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nRead N integers into A.\n\nCompute L array: L(1) = A(1). For i from2 to N, L(i) = gcd(L(i-1), A(i)).\n\nCompute R array: R(N) =A(N). For i from N-1 downto 1, R(i) = gcd(R(i+1), A(i)).\n\nCompute answer as the maximum of L(N-1) and R(2). Then for i from2 to N-1, compute gcd(L(i-1), R(i+1)) and compare to answer.\n\nFinally, print answer.\n\nSo translating that into Fortran.\n\nFirst, read N and array A.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC125_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:), L(:), R(:)\n    integer :: answer, temp_gcd\n\n    !

In 0-based, L[N-2] is the second last element of L, which in 1-based is L(N-1). Similarly, R[1] in 0-based is R(2) in 1-based.\n\nSo yes, the answer starts with max(L(N-1), R(2)).\n\nThen, for i from 1 to N-2 (in Java's 0-based), which corresponds to i from 2 to N-1 in 1-based (since N-2 in 0-based is N-1 in 1-based if N is the same). Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nJava's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < N - 1; i++) { ... }\n\nSo i runs from 1 to N-2 (inclusive). So the number of iterations is (N-2 -1 +1) = N-2.\n\nIn 1-based Fortran, the indices for the middle elements would be from 2 to N-1 (since excluding the first and last elements). For example, if N is 4, then in Java i=1 and 2 (0-based), which would be elements 2 and 3 in 1-based (since Java's 1 is 2 in 1-based, 2 is 3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, Java's loop is for (i=1; i < N-1; i++). So when N is 3, i runs from 1 to 1 (since N-1 is 2, and i <2). So in 0-based, that's for i=1. But in 1-based, the middle elements are i=2 (since N=3, elements are 1,2,3. Excluding first and last leaves element 2). So in Fortran, for N elements, the loop for i in 2 to N-1.\n\nYes. So in Fortran, the loop is do i=2, N-1.\n\nThus, the code for the answer is:\n\nanswer = max(L(N-1), R(2))\n\ndo i=2, N-1\n\n    temp_gcd = gcd(L(i-1), R(i+1))\n\n    if (temp_gcd > answer) answer = temp_gcd\n\nend do\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nPotential issues to check:\n\n- Array bounds. For example, when N=2. Then, L is size 2, L(2) is A(2) GCD A(1). Then, the initial answer is max(L(N-1), R(2)) \u2192 N-1 is 1, R(2) is R(2) but if N=2, R(2) is A(2). But in the code for R, when N=2, the loop for R starts at i=N-1=1. R(1) = gcd(R(2), A(1)). Then, R(2) is A(2). So when N=2, answer is max(L(1), R(2)). Then, the loop from 2 to N-1 (since N-1 is 1, so the loop runs from 2 to 1, which doesn't run. So answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: N=3.\n\nThe answer is max(L(2), R(2)), then check i=2 (since N-1=2). For i=2, compute gcd(L(1), R(3)). Because i+1 is3. R(3) is A(3). So the code would compute the gcd of L[1] (A[1]) and R[3] (A[3]), which is the GCD of the first and third elements, effectively excluding the second. Then compare with previous max.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut I think the code is correct. So the translated Fortran code should look like that."
