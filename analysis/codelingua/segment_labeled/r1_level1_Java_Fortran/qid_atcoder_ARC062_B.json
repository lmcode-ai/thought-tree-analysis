  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main class is atcoder_ARC062_B, but the important part is the TaskD class's solve method. The program reads a string S, then calculates a score based on the characters in the string. For each position i, if the character is different from the expected 'g' or 'p' (depending on whether i is even or odd), it adjusts the score. Finally, it prints the score.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to read a string from standard input, loop through each character, determine if the current character is 'g' or 'p' based on the index (even or odd), compare with the input character, and compute the score.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to read the input. In Java, they're using a custom InputReader class that reads tokens. But since the Fortran code will be simpler, maybe we can just read the entire line as the input string.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a single line, I can use READ(*, '(A)') S. But Fortran strings are fixed-length, so I need to declare the character variable with a sufficient length. Let's assume a maximum length, say 100000. But how does the Java code handle the input? The Java code reads the next token, which for a string like \"gppggp\" would work. So in Fortran, reading the entire line as a single string should suffice.\n\nNext, the loop. The Java code loops from i=0 to S.length()-1. In Fortran, strings are 1-indexed, so the loop should go from 1 to LEN_TRIM(S). Wait, but in Java, the indices start at 0. So for each character in S, the index i in Java is 0-based. So in Fortran, the position is i+1. For example, Java's i=0 corresponds to Fortran's 1st character.\n\nThe main logic: For each i, if i is even (0-based), then 'my' is 'g'; else 'p'. Then compare with the current character. If they are different, add 1 if 'my' is 'p', else subtract 1.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop index can be from 0 to LEN(S)-1 (if using 0-based logic). Wait, but Fortran is 1-based by default. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to adjust the index. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, i starts at 0. So for each position, check if i is even (i mod 2 ==0). So for the 0-based index. In Fortran, if we loop from 1 to N (where N is the length of S), then the equivalent 0-based index would be (pos-1). So the parity is determined by (pos-1) mod 2. So (pos-1) mod 2 is 0 when pos is odd (since pos-1 is even). So for pos in 1-based:\n\nIf pos is odd (like 1,3,5...), then (pos-1) is even \u2192 'my' is 'g'.\n\nIf pos is even (2,4,6...), then (pos-1) is odd \u2192 'my' is 'p'.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each position pos (1-based), my is 'g' if mod(pos-1,2) ==0, else 'p'.\n\nSo code:\n\nDO pos = 1, LEN_TRIM(S)\n    my_char = 'g'\n    IF (MOD(pos-1, 2) /= 0) THEN\n        my_char = 'p'\n    END IF\n    his_char = S(pos:pos)\n    IF (my_char /= his_char) THEN\n        IF (my_char == 'p') THEN\n            score = score + 1\n        ELSE\n            score = score -1\n        END IF\n    END IF\nEND DO\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when my and his are different, if my is 'p', add 1. Otherwise (my is 'g'), subtract 1. Because when my is 'p' and his is not, that means the current character is not 'p', but according to the game rules (as per the problem statement which is not given here), maybe the user chose 'p' when the opponent's is 'g', leading to a gain. But regardless, the logic is as per the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran, implement that.\n\nNow, handling the input. Declare a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say 100000. Then read from standard input. But how? In Fortran, when reading with format A, it reads the entire line. So:\n\nCHARACTER(100000) :: S\nREAD(*, '(A)') S\n\nBut then, the actual length is up to the input. So use LEN_TRIM(S) to get the actual length.\n\nNow, the variables: score is integer, initialized to 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nPROGRAM main\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    CHARACTER(100000) :: S\n    INTEGER :: score, pos\n    CHARACTER :: my_char, his_char\n\n    READ(*, '(A)') S\n    S = TRIM(S)\n    score = 0\n\n    DO pos = 1, LEN_TRIM(S)\n        IF (MOD(pos-1, 2) == 0) THEN\n            my_char = 'g'\n        ELSE\n            my_char = 'p'\n        END IF\n        his_char = S(pos:pos)\n        IF (my_char /= his_char) THEN\n            IF (my_char == 'p') THEN\n                score = score + 1\n            ELSE\n                score = score -1\n            END IF\n        END IF\n    END DO\n\n    PRINT *, score\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but the Java code uses TRIM on the input? No, in Java, next() reads the next token, which for a string like \"gpp\" would read the entire token. So in Fortran, using TRIM(S) after reading would remove trailing spaces, but the input may not have any. So perhaps better to read the entire line and process each character until the trimmed length.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you read with (A), the variable S will be filled with the input line, padded with spaces if the input is shorter than the declared length. So, using TRIM(S) would give the actual input string, but for the code, when we loop up to LEN_TRIM(S), that's correct. Because LEN_TRIM(S) returns the position of the last non-blank character.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, S is the input string, which could have any characters, including spaces? The problem likely expects that the input is a string of 'g' and 'p' characters. But the original code reads the next token, which would read until whitespace. So in Fortran, using READ(*, '(A)') S will read the entire line, including spaces, which may not be desired.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the input is read via in.next(), which uses StringTokenizer. So in Java, the next() method returns the next token, splitting on any whitespace. So the input is a single token, which is the S string. So in Fortran, to read a single token (assuming the input is a single word without spaces), perhaps using READ(*,*) S would be better. Because when you use list-directed input (READ(*, *)), it skips leading whitespace and reads until the next whitespace. However, in Fortran, for a character variable, the list-directed input will read the next non-blank characters, but it's a bit tricky. For example, if the input is \"hello world\", READ(*, *) S will read \"hello\" and leave \"world\" in the buffer. So if the input is a single token (no spaces), then using READ(*, *) S would read the entire token. But if the input contains spaces, then this would read only part. However, the original Java code uses in.next(), which splits on any whitespace. So assuming that the input is a single token (no whitespace), which is likely the case here.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way in Fortran is to read using list-directed input:\n\nREAD(*, *) S\n\nThis would read the entire next token, regardless of its length, but in Fortran, the variable S has a fixed length. If the input token is longer than the declared length of S, it will be truncated. So to avoid that, we need to declare S with a sufficient length. For example, set S to CHARACTER(100000) :: S, which is large enough for most cases.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line as the input, but then trim leading and trailing whitespace. But in the Java code, the input is read as a token, so leading whitespaces are skipped. So perhaps the Fortran code should read using list-directed input to skip leading whitespaces and read the next token.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nCHARACTER(100000) :: S\nREAD(*, *) S\n\nThen, the actual length is up to the first whitespace. Then, when processing, loop from 1 to LEN_TRIM(S). But LEN_TRIM(S) gives the position of the last non-blank character. However, if the input is \"gpp\", the S variable will be \"gpp\" followed by spaces. So LEN_TRIM(S) is 3. So that works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nPROGRAM main\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    CHARACTER(100000) :: S\n    INTEGER :: score, pos, length\n    CHARACTER :: my_char, his_char\n\n    READ(*, *) S\n    score = 0\n\n    DO pos = 1, LEN_TRIM(S)\n        IF (MOD(pos-1, 2) == 0) THEN\n            my_char = 'g'\n        ELSE\n            my_char = 'p'\n        END IF\n        his_char = S(pos:pos)\n        IF (my_char /= his_char) THEN\n            IF (my_char == 'p') THEN\n                score = score + 1\n            ELSE\n                score = score - 1\n            END IF\n        END IF\n    END DO\n\n    PRINT *, score\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nYes, this should work. Let's test with the example.\n\nFor example, suppose S is \"gpp\". Java code:\n\ni=0 (0-based): my is 'g', his is 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1: my is 'p', his is 'p' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: my is 'g', his is 'p' \u2192 different. my is 'g', so subtract 1. So score is -1.\n\nSo output is -1.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\npos runs from 1 to 3.\n\npos=1: pos-1=0 \u2192 even \u2192 my 'g'. his is 'g' \u2192 same. no change.\n\npos=2: pos-1=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 my 'p'. his is 'p' \u2192 same. no change.\n\npos=3: pos-1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 my 'g'. his is 'p' \u2192 different. subtract 1. score is -1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: S is \"pgg\".\n\nJava code:\n\ni=0 (my 'g') vs 'p' \u2192 different. my is 'g' \u2192 subtract 1. score=-1.\n\ni=1 (my 'p') vs 'g' \u2192 different. my 'p' \u2192 add 1. score=0.\n\ni=2 (my 'g') vs 'g' \u2192 same. total score 0.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\npos=1: my 'g' vs 'p' \u2192 subtract. -1.\n\npos=2: my 'p' vs 'g' \u2192 add. 0.\n\npos=3: my 'g' vs 'g' \u2192 no. total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written above."
