  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to convert this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java program reads a double from standard input, calculates countOdd as the input divided by 2 and rounded to the nearest integer. Then it computes the result as countOdd divided by input, and prints it with a scale of 10 decimal places using BigDecimal. Also, there's exception handling for IO and number format issues.\n\nFortran doesn't have exceptions like Java, so I'll need to handle errors differently. Also, Fortran uses different input/output methods.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In Java, they're using BufferedReader to read a line and parse it to a double. In Fortran, I can read from standard input using READ(*,*) to get a real number.\n\nThen, countOdd is calculated by rounding input/2. Java's Math.round rounds to the nearest integer. In Fortran, the equivalent function would be NINT (nearest integer). So count_odd = NINT(input / 2.0).\n\nNext, the result is count_odd divided by input. But Java's BigDecimal is used to set the scale to 10 decimal places. In Fortran, when printing, we can format the output to show 10 decimal places.\n\nSo the output in Fortran should use a format like F0.10 or something similar. But wait, the BigDecimal in Java's code is set to 10 decimal places with HALF_UP rounding. So we need to make sure the Fortran output rounds to 10 decimal places properly.\n\nAlso, in Java, if there's an error, like non-numeric input, it prints a stack trace and exits. Fortran doesn't handle exceptions, so maybe we can check the IOSTAT during input reading. If an error occurs, perhaps we can stop the program with an error message.\n\nPutting it together:\n\nFirst, declare variables. Let's use real variables. Wait, but input is parsed as a double in Java, so in Fortran, maybe use a double precision variable.\n\nSo variables:\n\nreal*8 :: input, count_odd, result\ninteger :: ierr\n\nThen, read the input with error checking:\n\nREAD(*, *, IOSTAT=ierr) input\nif (ierr /= 0) then\n  print *, \"Error reading input\"\n  stop\nend if\n\nBut in Java, NumberFormatException would occur if the input is not a valid double. So in Fortran, the IOSTAT will catch that.\n\nThen, compute count_odd as NINT(input / 2.0). Wait, input is a real number. For example, if input is 5, then 5/2 is 2.5, rounded to 3? Wait, Java's Math.round(5/2) would be Math.round(2.5) which is 3. But wait, in Java, 5 is an integer, but the code uses a double input. So if input is 5.0, then 5.0 / 2 is 2.5, Math.round(2.5) is 3.\n\nIn Fortran, NINT(2.5) returns 2 or 3? Wait, NINT rounds to the nearest integer, using the \"round half away from zero\" rule. So 2.5 rounds to 3.0 if using the default compiler settings. So NINT(2.5d0) would be 3.\n\nSo count_odd = NINT(input / 2.0d0)\n\nThen result is count_odd / input. But in Java, they use BigDecimal to scale to 10 decimal places, so the output should have exactly 10 digits after the decimal, rounded.\n\nIn Fortran, when printing, we can use a format that specifies 10 decimal places. Like '(F0.10)'.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC142_A\n  implicit none\n  real*8 :: input, count_odd, result\n  integer :: ierr\n\n  read(*, *, iostat=ierr) input\n  if (ierr /= 0) then\n    write(*, *) 'Error reading input'\n    stop\n  end if\n\n  count_odd = dble(nint(input / 2.0d0))\n  result = count_odd / input\n\n  write(*, '(F0.10)') result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC142_A\n\nWait, but in Java, the division is countOdd (an integer) divided by input (a double). So in Fortran, count_odd is a real*8, as nint returns integer, but cast to real*8 by dble.\n\nWait, nint returns an integer, so when we do count_odd = nint(input/2.0d0), but count_odd is declared as real*8. So we need to convert it to real*8. So perhaps count_odd = dble(nint(input / 2.0d0)).\n\nYes, because in Java, countOdd is a double because Math.round returns a long, but stored as a double. Wait, no. Wait, Math.round returns a long. Then assigned to countOdd, which is a double. So in Java, countOdd is a long cast to a double. So in Fortran, count_odd should be the integer result converted to a double.\n\nSo in Fortran, count_odd is dble(nint(...)).\n\nThen, when computing result = count_odd / input.\n\nBut input is a real*8, and count_odd is real*8, so division is real*8.\n\nThen, the output is written with F0.10 format. Let's test with input 5.0.\n\ncount_odd = nint(5.0/2.0) = 3.0.\n\nresult = 3.0 /5.0 = 0.6. So output is 0.6000000000.\n\nBut Java's code uses BigDecimal with scale 10. So the output would be 0.6 exactly, but with 10 decimal places.\n\nBut in Java, when you print the BigDecimal, it's 0.6000000000.\n\nIn Fortran, using F0.10 would display ten decimal places, padding with zeros if necessary.\n\nWait, let me check: the format F0.10 means total field width is as needed (0 means minimal), with 10 decimal places. So yes, 0.6 would be printed as 0.6000000000.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWhat about input 3.0?\n\ninput is 3.0. input /2 is 1.5, nint gives 2.0. result is 2.0/3.0 = 0.6666666666... which would be rounded to 10 decimal places as 0.6666666667.\n\nBut in Java, using HALF_UP, 0.6666666666666666... when rounded to 10 decimal places would be 0.6666666667.\n\nSo the Fortran code, when using F0.10, will round the number to 10 decimal places according to the compiler's default rounding mode, which is usually the same as HALF_UP. So that should be okay.\n\nNow, the exception handling. In Java, if the input can't be parsed as a double, it catches the exception and exits. In Fortran, we check iostat. If it's non-zero, we print an error and stop.\n\nSo that part is handled.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Java, when the input is read as a double. So in Fortran, reading a real*8 (double precision) should be correct.\n\nBut when the user inputs an integer, like 5, it's read as 5.0, which is okay.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as follows."
