  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The program reads an integer K and a string S. If the length of S is less than or equal to K, it prints S. Otherwise, it prints the first K characters followed by \"...\".\n\nFirst, I remember that in Fortran, variable declarations are important. So I'll need to declare variables for K and the string S. Also, Fortran uses fixed-length strings by default, but maybe I should use a character array with a sufficient length. Hmm.\n\nIn Java, they use Scanner to read input. In Fortran, we'll use READ statements. So for the integer K, that's straightforward: READ *, K. For the string S, since Fortran might read up to a certain length, I need to make sure the input is read correctly. Wait, in Fortran, when you read a string with READ *, it reads until a space or newline? Or maybe we should read the entire line. Oh, right, the original code uses next() which reads the next token, but maybe the problem expects the string to be a single line. Wait, in the Java code, it's next(), so it's the next token. So perhaps in Fortran, we can read the next token as well.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string variable with READ *, it will read until a whitespace. So if the input S is a single word, that's fine. But if S has spaces, the Java code would have read only the first part. But according to the problem statement, perhaps S is a single token. So I can proceed accordingly.\n\nSo declare S as a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say length 1000. Then read K and S.\n\nNext, check the length of S. In Fortran, the LEN_TRIM function gives the length without trailing spaces, but if the input string is read with leading and trailing spaces, maybe we need to adjust. Wait, the original Java code uses next(), which reads the next token, so leading whitespaces are skipped, and it reads until the next whitespace. So in Fortran, if we use READ *, S, that should behave similarly. So S will be the next token, with no leading or trailing spaces. So the length can be obtained with LEN_TRIM(S). Wait, but when you read a string with READ *, the variable is padded with spaces if the input is shorter than the declared length. For example, if S is declared as CHARACTER(100) :: S, and the input is \"abc\", then S will be 'abc' followed by 97 spaces. So LEN_TRIM(S) will give 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead K, S.\n\nIf the length of S (trimmed) is <= K, print S. Else, print the first K characters followed by '...'.\n\nBut how to take the substring in Fortran? In Fortran, S(1:K) would give the first K characters. But if the original S is shorter than K, then it would have trailing spaces. Wait, but in the case where S's actual length is less than K, the code should print S. So when S's length is less than or equal to K, output S. Otherwise, output first K chars and ... So in Fortran, when we take S(1:K), if S is shorter than K, it will just take all of S (with possible trailing spaces if the declared length is longer). Wait, no. Wait, if the variable S is declared as CHARACTER(1000), and the input is \"abc\", then S is 'abc' followed by 997 spaces. So S(1:K) would be the first K characters, which would be 'abc' followed by K-3 spaces. But when we print that, the trailing spaces would be part of the output. Which is not desired. Because the original Java code prints S as is. So perhaps we need to trim the output in the case where S is shorter than K.\n\nWait, the original code's condition is if S.length() <= K. The Java String's length is the actual number of characters, not counting any padding. So in Fortran, after reading S, the length we need is LEN_TRIM(S), which counts the number of characters up to the last non-space. So in the code, the condition should be: if LEN_TRIM(S) <= K.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead K and S.\n\nIf LEN_TRIM(S) <= K: print S with trailing spaces trimmed.\n\nElse, print the first K characters (without trailing spaces?) followed by '...'.\n\nWait, but when S is longer than K, in Java, substring(0,K) gives the first K characters, which are the exact K length. So in Fortran, S(1:K) would take the first K characters. But if S is, say, declared as 1000 characters, and the actual input is longer than K, then S(1:K) would give the first K characters. However, if the input string is shorter than K, then S(1:K) would include trailing spaces. But the Java code in that case would print S as is, which is the entire string (without trailing spaces).\n\nWait, so in the case where S's length is less than K, the Java code prints S, which is the entire string. But in Fortran, if we output S, it will output all the declared length (e.g., 1000 characters), including trailing spaces. That's a problem.\n\nSo how to avoid that? We need to output the trimmed string in both cases. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nIf S.length() <= K: print S.\n\nElse: print substring(0,K) + \"...\".\n\nIn Java, substring(0,K) gives the first K chars, even if the string is longer. So in Fortran, for the case when S is longer than K, we take the first K characters (without trimming) and append \"...\".\n\nBut if the actual string (after trimming) is longer than K, then take first K characters (including possible trailing spaces?), but that may not be desired.\n\nWait, maybe the original code's S is a single token, with no spaces, so when we read S in Fortran, the trimmed length is the actual length. For example, if S is \"abcde\", then LEN_TRIM(S) is 5. So in the case where K is 3, we take the first 3 characters (abc) and add \"...\".\n\nBut in Fortran, if S is declared as CHARACTER(1000), then S(1:3) is 'abc' (assuming the input is 'abcde', but wait, the input is 'abcde', then S would be 'abcde' followed by 995 spaces. So S(1:3) is 'abc', which is correct.\n\nBut when the length is less than K, for example, S is 'abc' (length 3), K is 5. Then, the condition is true, and we print S. But S in Fortran is 1000 characters, so printing S would give 'abc' followed by 997 spaces. Which is not desired. So in that case, we need to trim S when printing.\n\nSo the correct approach is: in both cases, when printing S, we should output only the trimmed part.\n\nSo in the first case, when LEN_TRIM(S) <= K: print the trimmed S. Otherwise, print S(1:K) (which is K characters) followed by \"...\".\n\nBut how to trim the string in Fortran? Using TRIM(S) function. So the code would be:\n\nIF (LEN_TRIM(S) <= K) THEN\n    PRINT *, TRIM(S)\nELSE\n    PRINT *, TRIM(S(1:K)) // '...'\nEND IF\n\nWait, but in the else case, S(1:K) would be the first K characters, which may include trailing spaces if the actual string is shorter than K. But in the else case, the condition is that LEN_TRIM(S) > K. So the actual length (after trimming) is more than K, so taking the first K characters (S(1:K)) would include exactly K characters, and the trailing part of S may be spaces if the declared length is larger than K. Wait, but the S variable is read from input. For example, if S is declared as 1000 characters, and the input is 'abcdefghij' (10 characters), then S is 'abcdefghij' followed by 990 spaces. So LEN_TRIM(S) is 10. If K is 5, then S(1:5) is 'abcde', which is correct. So in the else case, S(1:K) would be the first K characters of the input string, regardless of the declared length. So trimming S(1:K) would give the first K characters (but if the original string is longer than K, then S(1:K) is exactly K characters, and any trailing spaces would be part of the input? Wait, no. Because the input S was read as a single token, so it's all the characters up to the next whitespace. So in the case where S is longer than K, the first K characters would be the actual characters from the input, with no trailing spaces (unless the input itself had spaces, but the Java code uses next(), which reads a single token). So in the else case, S(1:K) would have exactly K characters, possibly including trailing spaces only if the original input had them.\n\nWait, but the original input is a token, so no spaces. So S, after reading, is a string with no internal spaces. So in the else case, S(1:K) is the first K characters of the input, which is exactly what we want. But when we output S(1:K) in Fortran, if the variable is longer than K, then the substring is the first K characters. So for example, S is 'abcdefghij' stored in 1000 characters. S(1:5) is 'abcde', followed by 995 spaces. But when you print S(1:5), you get 'abcde' followed by 5-5=0? Wait, no: S is declared as CHARACTER(1000), so S(1:5) is a substring of length 5. So when printed with PRINT *, S(1:5), it will output 5 characters, which are the first 5 of S, including any leading or trailing characters. But since S was read as a single token, the input was, say, 'hello' (length 5) or 'helloworld' (length 10). So in the else case, S(1:K) is exactly the first K characters of the input.\n\nBut when you print S(1:K), if K is 3 and S is 'abcde' (stored in 1000-length variable), then S(1:3) is 'abc', and printing that would output 'abc'.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when you take a substring like S(1:K), it creates a substring of length K, but if the original S is declared as longer than K, then the substring is exactly the first K characters. So for example, if S is 'abcdefghij' (10 characters), then S(1:5) is 'abcde'. So in that case, the output would be correct.\n\nSo in the else clause, we need to output the first K characters of S followed by '...'. So in Fortran, that would be S(1:K) // '...'.\n\nBut when you concatenate, the S(1:K) is a substring of K characters. So the code for the else case would be:\n\nPRINT *, S(1:K) // '...'\n\nBut in Fortran, when you print a string with the PRINT * statement, it adds a space between elements. Wait, no. If you concatenate two strings, then PRINT *, will output them as a single string. Let me test.\n\nFor example, in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(5) :: a = \"hello\"\ncharacter(3) :: b = \"123\"\n\nprint *, a(1:3) // \"...\"\n\nThis would output 'hel...' ?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the concatenation operator is //. So S(1:K) is a character string of length K. Then, when you concatenate with '...', which is length 3, the result is a string of length K+3. Then, when you print that, it will output all characters without any added spaces. Because when you use PRINT *, it outputs each element with a space, but if it's a single element (the concatenated string), then it will print it as is.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: if the argument to PRINT * is a single string, then it will print it left-justified, and then add a newline. For example:\n\nPRINT *, 'abc' // 'def'\n\nThis will print 'abcdef' followed by a newline.\n\nSo in the else case, the code would be:\n\nPRINT *, S(1:K) // '...'\n\nBut when K is 3 and S is 'abcdef', then S(1:3) is 'abc', concatenated with '...' gives 'abc...'. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the output is S.substring(0,K) + \"...\". Which for K=3 and S length 6, gives 'abc...'.\n\nSo the Fortran code seems correct.\n\nNow, the case when the length of S is less than or equal to K. For example, S is 'abc', K is 5. Then, the code should output 'abc'. But in Fortran, S is declared as a longer string (like 1000), so when you print S, it will output all 1000 characters, including the trailing spaces. Which is not desired. So we need to trim the output. So in the first case, we should print TRIM(S), which removes trailing spaces.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nIF (LEN_TRIM(S) <= K) THEN\n    PRINT *, TRIM(S)\nELSE\n    PRINT *, S(1:K) // '...'\nEND IF\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nIn Fortran, the program structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: K\n    character(1000) :: S  ! assuming 1000 is sufficient for input\n    read *, K\n    read *, S\n    if (len_trim(S) <= K) then\n        print *, trim(S)\n    else\n        print *, S(1:K) // '...'\n    end if\nend program main\n\nBut wait, how does Fortran handle reading the string S? Because when you read with read *, S, it reads the next token. So if the input is something like \"3 abcdefghijk\", then the first read takes K=3, the second read takes S='abcdefghijk'. Which is correct.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7\nnikoandsolstice\n\nOutput should be nikoand...\n\nWait, Java code's K is 7, S is length 15. So output is first 7 chars + '...' \u2192 'nikoand...' \u2192 but wait, S is \"nikoandsolstice\". The first 7 characters are 'nikoand' (n,i,k,o,a,n,d \u2192 7 letters). Then append '...' \u2192 'nikoand...'.\n\nIn Fortran code, S(1:7) is 'nikoand', then '...' \u2192 'nikoand...'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: if K is 100, S is 'abc', then output 'abc'.\n\nBut in Fortran, when S is read as a 1000-length string, then TRIM(S) is 'abc', so printed.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. What if the input string is longer than 1000 characters? Then the code would truncate. But the original Java code uses String S which can be up to any length. To handle longer strings, the Fortran code would need to declare S with a sufficient length. But the problem probably expects the code to handle inputs up to a certain size. Alternatively, the code could read S as a character variable with a large enough size, like 1000, which is probably sufficient for the problem's constraints.\n\n2. Leading or trailing spaces in the input. But according to the Java code, since next() is used, leading spaces are skipped and the token is read until the next whitespace. So in Fortran, read *, S will do the same. So leading spaces are skipped, S is the next token. So trailing spaces in the input are not part of S. For example, inputting \"3   abcd  \" \u2192 K=3, S='abcd' (without trailing spaces).\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code is as above."
