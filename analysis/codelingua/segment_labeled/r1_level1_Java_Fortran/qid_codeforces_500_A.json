But according to the original Java code's logic, the check for currpos == arr.length +1 is made before accessing the array. Wait, no. Let's see: In Java's dfs function:\n\nif (currpos == target) return true;\nif (currpos == arr.length +1) return false;\n// then proceed to access arr[currpos-1] So, if currpos is 5, and arr.length is 3 (so arr.length +1 is 4), then the first two checks are not triggered, and the code would access arr[5-1=4], which is out of bounds (since arr has indexes 0-2). So the code would throw an exception here. But the problem's test cases may not have such scenarios. So perhaps in the problem's context, the teleport steps never take the currpos beyond the array's indices.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main method reads two integers, n and goal. Then it reads n-1 integers into an array arr. The dfs function is a recursive function that checks if we can reach the target position by teleporting through the array. \n\nFirst, in Fortran, I need to handle the input. The Java code uses a Scanner to read inputs. In Fortran, I'll use READ statements. The variables n and goal will be integers. The array arr has size n-1, so I need to read n-1 elements.\n\nThe recursive function dfs in Java returns a boolean. Fortran functions can return values, but recursion might be a bit tricky. Wait, does Fortran support recursion? I think modern Fortran does, especially with the RECURSIVE keyword. So I need to declare the function as recursive.\n\nThe base cases for dfs are: if currpos equals target, return true. If currpos exceeds the array length (arr.length is n-1 in Java, so currpos can go up to (n-1)+1 = n?), but in Java code, the check is currpos == arr.length +1. Wait, arr has length n-1, so arr.length +1 is (n-1)+1 = n. So if currpos reaches n, return false. So in the Fortran code, when currpos is n, return false.\n\nWait, in the Java code's dfs function: the parameters are currpos, arr, target. The base case is if currpos == target, return true. If currpos == arr.length +1, return false. Since arr in Java is size n-1, arr.length +1 is (n-1)+1 =n. So when currpos is n, return false. Then, the function does a teleport by adding arr[currpos -1] to currpos and recurses. So arr is 1-based in the Java code? Because arr[currpos-1], and currpos starts at 1. Wait, when currpos is 1, arr[0] is the first element, which is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So when translating, the array in Fortran can be declared as (n-1), and accessed directly with currpos. Wait, no. Let's think: in Java, arr is 0-based. So when currpos is 1, arr[0] is the first element, then adding that to currpos (1) gives the next position. In Fortran, the array is 1-based. So when currpos is 1, arr(1) is the first element. So the code would be adding arr(currpos) to currpos. Wait, that would be different. So in Java, the index is currpos -1, so in Fortran, since it's 1-based, arr(currpos) is equivalent to Java's arr[currpos-1]. So the code for the teleport step would be currpos + arr(currpos). \n\nSo the recursion step in Fortran would be teleport = dfs(currpos + arr(currpos), arr, target). \n\nNow, the function. Let's outline the Fortran code structure.\n\nFirst, the main program. Read n and goal. Then read n-1 integers into the array arr. Then call the dfs function starting from currpos=1, and check the result. If true, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nIn Fortran, functions must be declared, and if they are recursive, the recursive keyword is needed. The function returns a logical value. \n\nSo, the recursive function would look like:\n\nrecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n    logical :: res\n    ...\nend function\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the array is passed with the dimension. So the function will take the array as an argument.\n\nNow, the base cases: if currpos == target, return .TRUE. If currpos exceeds the array size plus 1? Wait, in Java, the check is currpos == arr.length +1. Since arr in Java is of length n-1, that's n. So in Fortran, arr is size n-1. So when currpos exceeds n, return false. Wait, no. Wait, in Java code, arr's length is n-1, so arr.length +1 is n. So the check is if currpos == n, return false. So in Fortran, the check should be if currpos == n, return .FALSE. But how do we know what n is? Because the array arr in the Fortran function is of size n-1 (since the array was read as n-1 elements). So arr is dimension (n-1), so the maximum index is n-1. Wait, but how does the function know what n is? Because in the function, arr's size can be determined using the SIZE intrinsic function. So SIZE(arr) gives n-1. So arr's length is SIZE(arr), so arr.length +1 in Java is SIZE(arr) + 1, which is (n-1) +1 =n. So the check is if currpos == SIZE(arr)+1, then return .FALSE.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the check is if (currpos == arr.length +1) return false. So in Fortran, that translates to if (currpos == SIZE(arr) +1) then res = .FALSE.\n\nSo, in the function:\n\nif (currpos == target) then\n    res = .TRUE.\nelse if (currpos == SIZE(arr) +1) then\n    res = .FALSE.\nelse\n    ... do the teleport\nend if\n\nBut then, when currpos is greater than SIZE(arr) +1, the function would not hit that condition. But in the Java code, the condition is only checked when currpos is exactly equal to arr.length +1. So, in Fortran, the same condition.\n\nBut then, in the Java code, the function can have currpos greater than arr.length +1, which would proceed to the next step, but since in Java, when currpos exceeds the array length, arr[currpos-1] would be out of bounds, but in the Java code, the first check is if currpos == target. So perhaps in the code, the teleport is allowed even if currpos exceeds the array length, but in that case, the next call to dfs will trigger the currpos == arr.length +1 check.\n\nWait, let's see the Java code's dfs function:\n\npublic static boolean dfs(int currpos, int[] arr, int target) {\n    if (currpos == target) return true;\n    if (currpos == arr.length +1) return false;\n    boolean teleport = dfs(currpos + arr[currpos -1], arr, target);\n    if (teleport) return true;\n    return false;\n}\n\nSo, if currpos is not target and not arr.length+1, then it tries to teleport by adding arr[currpos-1] to currpos. So even if currpos is beyond the array length, but not equal to arr.length+1, then arr[currpos-1] would be an index out of bounds. Wait, but in Java, that would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Wait, this is a problem. Let's see: For example, if currpos is arr.length + 2. Then currpos-1 is arr.length +1. The array has indexes 0 to arr.length-1. So arr[currpos-1] is arr[arr.length], which is out of bounds. But how does the Java code avoid that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is such that in the input, the teleport steps never go beyond the array. For example, the code in the main function calls dfs(1, arr, goal). The arr is of size n-1, where n is the first input. So, when currpos is 1, arr[0] is the first element. Then currpos + arr[0] must be <= arr.length +1? Otherwise, when adding arr[currpos-1], which could be a value that makes currpos exceed the array length, leading to an array index out of bounds.\n\nHmm, but the original Java code may have a bug here. Because, suppose currpos is such that currpos-1 is within the array's bounds. For example, if the array has length 3 (n-1=3, so n=4), then arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]. If currpos is 4, then currpos-1 is 3, which is arr[3], which is out of bounds. Wait, no. If arr has length 3 (indices 0-2), then currpos can't be 4 here, because in the first check, if currpos is 4 (arr.length+1 is 3+1=4?), then the code returns false. So in the Java code, before accessing arr[currpos-1], it checks if currpos is target or arr.length+1. If it's neither, then proceed. So currpos can be greater than arr.length+1? Because, for example, if currpos is arr.length+2, then the first check (currpos == target) would be false. Then, currpos == arr.length+1 is also false, so proceed to call dfs with currpos + arr[currpos-1], but arr[currpos-1] would be arr[arr.length+1], which is out of bounds.\n\nSo this seems like a potential error in the Java code. But the problem may have constraints that prevent this. For example, the problem may state that teleporting from any position is only possible to positions within the allowed range, so that the code doesn't hit this error. But in the code as written, there's a possibility of an out-of-bounds access.\n\nBut regardless, I need to translate the code as it is. So in Fortran, the code must replicate the same logic. So, in Fortran, when we access arr(currpos), since the array is 1-based, but in Java it's 0-based. So in Java's code, when currpos is 1, we access arr[0]. In Fortran, that would be arr(1). So, the code in Fortran would be adding arr(currpos) to currpos. \n\nSo, the teleport step is:\n\nteleport = dfs(currpos + arr(currpos), arr, target)\n\nBut we need to check if currpos is within the array bounds. Wait, but in Java, if currpos is greater than arr.length, then arr[currpos-1] would be out of bounds. So in Fortran, if currpos is greater than the array's size, arr(currpos) would be out of bounds. So how to handle that?\n\nBut according to the original Java code's logic, the check for currpos == arr.length +1 is made before accessing the array. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java's dfs function:\n\nif (currpos == target) return true;\nif (currpos == arr.length +1) return false;\n// then proceed to access arr[currpos-1]\n\nSo, if currpos is 5, and arr.length is 3 (so arr.length +1 is 4), then the first two checks are not triggered, and the code would access arr[5-1=4], which is out of bounds (since arr has indexes 0-2). So the code would throw an exception here. But the problem's test cases may not have such scenarios. So perhaps in the problem's context, the teleport steps never take the currpos beyond the array's indices. So in Fortran, the code would have the same potential for runtime errors (array index out of bounds) if currpos exceeds the array's size. \n\nSo how to handle this? Well, the original Java code is written this way, and perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that this never happens. So the Fortran code must replicate this behavior, even if it could lead to an out-of-bounds error under certain inputs.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the function will proceed to access arr(currpos) even if currpos is larger than the array's size. Which would cause a runtime error in Fortran. But according to the problem's constraints, maybe that's not possible.\n\nWait, but let's see the input example. For example, if n is 4, then arr has 3 elements. The user enters 3 values. Let's say arr is [1, 2, 3]. Then, starting at currpos=1:\n\ncurrpos=1: check if 1 is target (say goal=3). If not, check if 1 ==4 (n=4). No. So add arr(1)=1, next pos is 2. Then check if 2 is target. Then add arr(2)=2, next pos 4. Check if 4 is target (3? No). Check if 4 ==4, yes. Return false. So in this case, the code would return false.\n\nBut if the target is 4, then when currpos reaches 4, it's equal to target. So return true.\n\nBut if the arr has a value that makes currpos exceed the array's size. For example, arr = [3], n=2. Then, currpos starts at 1. Add arr(1) =3. Next currpos is 4. Check if 4 is target. If target is 2, no. Check if currpos is arr.length+1 (arr's length is 1, so 1+1=2). 4 !=2. So proceed to access arr[4-1=3], which is arr[3-1=2? Wait, in Java, arr has length 1 (since n-1 is 1). So arr[0] is the only element. So currpos is 4, then currpos-1=3, which is arr[3], which is out of bounds. So the Java code would crash here.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's input is designed such that this never happens. So the Fortran code has to replicate this behavior, even if it may crash for some inputs. \n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran? Because in Fortran, accessing an array out of bounds is undefined behavior and may cause runtime errors, depending on the compiler and options. So the translated code must have the same logic, even with potential errors.\n\nSo, proceeding under the assumption that the input is valid, let's proceed with the translation.\n\nThe steps for the Fortran code:\n\n1. Read n and goal from input.\n\n2. Read n-1 integers into array arr.\n\n3. Call the recursive function dfs starting at currpos=1, with arr and goal.\n\n4. Print YES or NO based on the result.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the main program would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_500_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, goal, i\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n    logical :: isFound\n\n    read(*, *) n, goal\n    allocate(arr(n-1))\n    read(*, *) arr(1:n-1)\n    isFound = dfs(1, arr, goal)\n    if (isFound) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program\n\nBut wait, the initial code in Java uses a scanner to read the next integers. So in Fortran, the read statement would read the entire line. So if the input is given as a single line, the read(*, *) n, goal will read them. Then, the next line contains n-1 integers. Or perhaps all inputs are on a single line? The original Java code uses a Scanner which reads input as space-separated tokens. So in Fortran, the code should read all inputs correctly.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using read(*, *), it reads from standard input, consuming the required values. So the code should work.\n\nNow, the dfs function:\n\nrecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n    logical :: res\n    integer :: next_pos\n\n    if (currpos == target) then\n        res = .true.\n    else if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n        res = .false.\n    else\n        next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n        res = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n        if (res) return\n        res = .false.\n    end if\nend function\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the teleport, if it returns true, then return true. Otherwise, return false. So in the Java code, the line:\n\nboolean teleport = dfs(...);\nif (teleport) return true;\nreturn false;\n\nWhich is equivalent to return teleport. So the code can be simplified to return dfs(...);. But in Java, the code is written as:\n\nteleport = dfs(...);\nif (teleport) return true;\nreturn false;\n\nWhich is the same as return teleport;.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing res = dfs(...), then if res is true, return. Otherwise, return false. So the code can be written as:\n\nres = dfs(...)\nif (res) then\n    return\nend if\nres = .false.\n\nBut in the else block of the function.\n\nWait, the code in the else clause (when currpos is not target and not size(arr)+1) would be:\n\nnext_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\nres = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\nif (res) then\n    return\nelse\n    res = .false.\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the teleport call, if teleport is true, returns true, else returns false. So the code returns the value of teleport. So in Fortran, that can be written as:\n\nres = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n\nSo the entire else block would be:\n\nelse\n    next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n    res = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\nend if\n\nWait, but the Java code returns whatever dfs returns. So why does the Java code have if (teleport) return true; else return false? Because that's redundant. The code could just return teleport. But the original code is written that way. For example, in Java:\n\nboolean teleport = dfs(...);\nif (teleport) return true;\nreturn false;\n\nWhich is equivalent to return teleport;.\n\nSo in Fortran, in the else clause, after calculating next_pos, call dfs and set res to that result.\n\nSo the code in the else block would be:\n\nnext_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\nres = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n\nThus, the Fortran function would be:\n\nrecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n    logical :: res\n    integer :: next_pos\n\n    if (currpos == target) then\n        res = .true.\n    else if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n        res = .false.\n    else\n        next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n        res = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n    end if\nend function\n\nWait, but this is different from the original Java code. Because in the Java code, if the teleport call returns false, then the code returns false. But in this Fortran code, after the teleport call, it returns whatever res is. So the code is equivalent. Because the Java code returns the value of the teleport variable, which is the return value of the recursive call. So yes, the code can be written this way.\n\nBut in the Java code, the else clause in the function is:\n\nboolean teleport = dfs(...);\nif (teleport) return true;\nreturn false;\n\nWhich is equivalent to returning the result of the teleport. So in Fortran, the else clause can simply return the result of the recursive call.\n\nSo, the code for the function can be written as:\n\nrecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n    logical :: res\n    integer :: next_pos\n\n    if (currpos == target) then\n        res = .true.\n    else if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n        res = .false.\n    else\n        next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n        res = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n    end if\nend function\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the code returns false if the teleport returns false. So this is exactly what this code does. Because if the recursive call returns false, then res is false, and that's the returned value. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the next_pos is larger than size(arr)+1? For example, currpos is 2, arr(2) is 5. Then next_pos is 7. If the target is not 7 and 7 is not size(arr)+1, then the code would try to access arr(7), which is beyond the array. This would cause a runtime error in Fortran. But the original Java code would also crash in such cases, so the code is translated correctly.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_500_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, goal\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n    logical :: isFound\n\n    read(*, *) n, goal\n    allocate(arr(n-1))\n    read(*, *) arr\n    isFound = dfs(1, arr, goal)\n    if (isFound) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n    deallocate(arr)\ncontains\n    recursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(res)\n        integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n        integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n        logical :: res\n        integer :: next_pos\n\n        if (currpos == target) then\n            res = .true.\n        else if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n            res = .false.\n        else\n            next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n            res = dfs(next_pos, arr, target)\n        end if\n    end function dfs\nend program codeforces_500_A\n\nBut there are a few syntax points to check:\n\n- In Fortran, the array is declared as (n-1), and in the allocate statement, it's allocate(arr(n-1)).\n\n- In the read statement for arr, it's read(*, *) arr(1:n-1) or just arr, since it's allocated to size n-1.\n\n- In the function, arr is declared as arr(:), which is an assumed-shape array, so the size is determined at runtime.\n\n- The function is inside the contains section of the program, which allows it to have access to the variables in the program's scope. But in this case, the function is passed the necessary parameters, so it's okay.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function is inside the program's contains section. So the function is part of the program, and has access to the program's variables. But the function's parameters are passed, so no problem.\n\nBut in the function, the line:\n\nelse if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n\nWhich computes size(arr) as the size of the passed array. Since arr is declared as (n-1) in the program, size(arr) is n-1. So currpos == (n-1) +1 \u2192 currpos ==n.\n\nSo the code correctly checks if currpos is n.\n\nNow, let's test this code with an example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n5 3\n1 2 1 2\n\nIn Java, the code would start at 1. arr[0] is 1 \u2192 next pos 2. Then arr[1] is 2 \u2192 next pos 4. arr[3] (Java index 3) is 2 \u2192 next pos 6. Since arr.length is 4 (n-1=5-1=4), arr.length +1=5. So currpos 6 is not equal to 5, so check if it's target (3). No. Then, access arr[5], which is out of bounds. So the code would crash. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps this input is invalid. \n\nBut suppose the input is:\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n2 1 1\n\nJava code:\n\nn=4, goal=4. arr is [2,1,1]. \n\nStart at currpos=1. Check if 1 ==4? No. Check if 1==4? No. Add arr[0]=2 \u2192 next pos 3. Check if 3 ==4? No. Check if 3 ==4? No. Add arr[2] =1 \u2192 next pos 4. Check if 4 ==4 \u2192 yes. Return true. So output is YES.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ncurrpos=1. arr(1)=2 \u2192 next pos=3. Then arr(3)=1 \u2192 next pos=4. Which equals target, returns true.\n\nSo the code would output YES.\n\nAnother test case where the path is not possible.\n\nSample Input 3:\n4 3\n1 1 1\n\nJava code:\n\nStart at 1. add 1 \u21922. add 1 \u21923. which is target. Return yes.\n\nFortran code would do the same.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential syntax errors:\n\n- In Fortran, the line next_pos = currpos + arr(currpos) \u2192 the closing parenthesis should be a closing bracket.\n\nWait, in Fortran, array indices are accessed with parentheses. So arr(currpos).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nnext_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: The contains section must come after the main program's variables and before the end program. And the function must be declared as part of the contains section.\n\nThus, the code should work."
