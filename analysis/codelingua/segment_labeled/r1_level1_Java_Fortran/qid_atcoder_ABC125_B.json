Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer n, then two lines of space-separated integers representing v and c lists. It calculates the maximum profit by summing up the positive differences between corresponding elements in v and c. So for each i from 0 to n-1, if v[i] - c[i] is positive, add it to the total max.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to read inputs. Java uses Scanner, but Fortran reads from standard input with READ statements. Let's see: the first input is n. Then two lines for v and c.\n\nIn Java, the str2List function splits the string into a map with keys as indices. But in Fortran, arrays are easier. So instead of using a map, we'll use arrays for v and c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n2. Read the next line as v array with n elements.\n3. Read the next line as c array with n elements.\n4. Initialize max to 0.\n5. Loop from i=1 to n (since Fortran arrays start at 1 by default), calculate profit = v(i) - c(i). If profit >0, add to max.\n6. Print max.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices can start at 1, but when reading the input, the Java code uses 0-based. But in the loop, the Java code uses i from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, if the arrays are 1-based, the loop will be from 1 to n.\n\nBut how to read the arrays? The input lines are space-separated numbers. So in Fortran, for reading the arrays, we can read them as a list.\n\nSo for reading n: read *, n.\n\nThen, read the next line as v array. But Fortran can read a line of numbers into an array with the right format. For example, if n is 3, then the input line would be three numbers.

Let me check if there are other differences. The Java code uses 0-based indices for the maps, but in Fortran, the arrays are 1-based.
