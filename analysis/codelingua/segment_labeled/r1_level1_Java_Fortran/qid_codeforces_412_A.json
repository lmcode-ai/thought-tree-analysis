  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe Java program reads three inputs: n, k, and a string a. Then it decides whether to move left or right based on the value of k compared to n/2. If k is greater than n/2, it moves right until k equals n. Otherwise, it moves left until k is 1. Then, depending on whether k is 1 or not, it prints each character of the string, moving right or left between them, except for the last character.\n\nFirst, I need to handle input in Fortran. Java uses Scanner, so in Fortran, I'll use READ statements. The first input is two integers, n and k. Then a string a. So maybe something like:\n\ninteger :: n, k\ncharacter(len=100) :: a  ! Assuming the string isn't longer than 100 characters?\n\nThen read them with READ(*,*) n, k, a.\n\nBut wait, the string a in Java might have spaces? Well, in the Java code, the scanner's next() method reads the next token, which is space-delimited. So the input for a is a single word. So in Fortran, reading with a character variable should work, but need to adjust the length. Maybe set a maximum length, and then trim it later.\n\nNext, the first part of the code: if k > n/2, then loop to print \"RIGHT\" until k reaches n. Otherwise, loop to print \"LEFT\" until k is 1.\n\nIn Fortran, loops are do loops. For example, the first part could be:\n\nif (k > n/2) then\n    do while (k < n)\n        print *, \"RIGHT\"\n        k = k + 1\n    end do\nelse\n    do while (k > 1)\n        print *, \"LEFT\"\n        k = k - 1\n    end do\nend if\n\nThen, after adjusting k, the next part: if k is 1, iterate over the string from start to end, printing each character and moving right except after the last. If not 1 (which would be k == n?), iterate from end to start, printing each character and moving left except after the first.\n\nWait, in Java code, after the initial loops, k would be either 1 or n. Because the first loop increases k until it's n if k was in the right half, or decreases to 1 if in the left.\n\nSo the second part is when k is 1, print each character left to right. So for each character from 0 to a.length-1, print \"PRINT \" + a.charAt(i), then \"RIGHT\" if not last. Otherwise, if k is not 1 (which would be when it's n), print from the end to start, then move left.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-based. So the Java code's a.charAt(i) for i from 0 to len-1 would translate to a(i+1:i+1) in Fortran. Also, the length of the string in Fortran can be obtained with len_trim(a), assuming that the input string is properly read and padded with spaces, but perhaps the actual input string is shorter. So need to get the actual length first.\n\nSo first, after reading a, get the actual length. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: len_a\nlen_a = len_trim(a)\n\nBut wait, when the user inputs the string, if it's read with READ(*,*) a, then leading or trailing spaces might be stripped. So maybe the code in Java expects a single token as the string. So in Fortran, reading with READ(*,'(A)') a would read the entire line, but perhaps leading/trailing spaces may be considered. Hmm, perhaps the Java code's a is a single token. So maybe the Fortran code should read a as a single word. So perhaps using read(*,*) a would read until the first whitespace, but that depends on the compiler's handling. Alternatively, maybe read the entire line and then process.\n\nBut given that the original Java code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token, then in Fortran, using read(*,*) a would also read the next token, which is a single word. So assuming that a is a single word with no spaces.\n\nSo after that, the length of a is len_trim(a).\n\nThen, the code proceeds as follows:\n\nIf k == 1:\n\ndo i = 1 to len_a\n\n    print \"('PRINT ',A)\", a(i:i)\n\n    if (i < len_a) then\n        print *, \"RIGHT\"\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nElse (k is n):\n\ndo i = len_a downto 1\n\n    print \"('PRINT ',A)\", a(i:i)\n\n    if (i > 1) then\n        print *, \"LEFT\"\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, the else block loops from a.length-1 down to 0.

Let's code that.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So the code structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_412_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, i, len_a\n    character(len=100) :: a  ! Adjust the length as needed\n\n    read(*,*) n, k, a\n    len_a = len_trim(a)\n\n    if (k > n/2) then\n        do while (k < n)\n            print *, \"RIGHT\"\n            k = k + 1\n        end do\n    else\n        do while (k > 1)\n            print *, \"LEFT\"\n            k = k -1\n        end do\n    end if\n\n    if (k == 1) then\n        do i = 1, len_a\n            print '(A, X, A)', \"PRINT\", a(i:i)\n            if (i < len_a) then\n                print *, \"RIGHT\"\n            end if\n        end do\n    else\n        do i = len_a, 1, -1\n            print '(A, X, A)', \"PRINT\", a(i:i)\n            if (i > 1) then\n                print *, \"LEFT\"\n            end if\n        end do\n    end if\nend program codeforces_412_A\n\nWait, but the 'PRINT ' in Java includes the character. So in Fortran, when we print \"PRINT \" followed by the character, we need to format it. So using something like:\n\nprint '(\"PRINT \", A)', a(i:i)\n\nYes. Because in Fortran, the format string can be written as '(A, X, A)', but to avoid leading space, better to use \"PRINT \" concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nprint '(A, A)', 'PRINT ', a(i:i)\n\nBut in Java, it's \"PRINT \" + char, which is exactly that.\n\nSo in the code, for each PRINT statement, the format is '(\"PRINT \", A)'.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: when n is even or odd. But the Java code uses integer division, so n/2 is truncated. So in Fortran, n/2 would be integer division as well.\n\nAnother thing: after the initial loops, what is the value of k?\n\nIn the Java code, after the initial loops, if k was in the right half, then after moving right until k equals n. Similarly, moving left until k is 1.\n\nSo after the initial loops, k is either 1 or n.\n\nTherefore, in the second part, the condition k == 1 is correct. Else, when k is n.\n\nBut in Fortran, after the loops, the value of k would have been modified. So in the code, the first part modifies k to reach 1 or n.\n\nSo the rest of the code checks if k is 1 (then left to right) or else (n, then right to left).\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose n is 5, k is 3. Then n/2 is 2 (since 5/2 is 2 in integer division). 3>2, so move right until k=5. Then, in the else part (k is not 1), loop from the end to start.\n\nBut in the code, after moving to 5, the code will print each character from last to first, moving left between them.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. n/2 is 2. So k is not greater than n/2 (since 2 == 2). So else clause: move left until k is 1. Then, loop left to right.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nIn Fortran, when you read a string with read(*,*) a, the variable a must have a sufficient length. If the input string is longer than 100 characters, it will be truncated. So perhaps set a larger length, like 1000.\n\nBut the problem's constraints probably specify that the string length is manageable.\n\nAnother thing: the Java code uses 0-based indexes, while Fortran is 1-based. But in the code, the loops are from 0 to len-1, which translates to 1 to len in Fortran.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the first case (k == 1):\n\nJava's loop is for (int i=0; i<a.length(); i++) ... a.charAt(i)\n\nIn Fortran, i runs from 1 to len_a.\n\nSimilarly, the else case loops from a.length()-1 down to 0: in Fortran, from len_a down to 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code."
