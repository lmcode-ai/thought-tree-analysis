  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at the main part of the Java code. The main class is atcoder_ABC151_A, which reads a character from the input and prints the next character. The RemRing class seems to handle modular arithmetic operations, but since the main program doesn't use it, maybe I don't need to translate that part. Wait, the user probably wants the main program translated. Let me check the main method again.\n\nThe Java code uses BufferedReader to read a line from standard input. Then it takes the first character of the string, adds 1 to it, and prints the resulting character. For example, if input is 'a', output is 'b'.\n\nIn Fortran, reading input can be done with READ statements. Characters in Fortran are handled using strings. So the steps would be: read a string, get the first character, increment its ASCII value by 1, convert back to a character, and print it.\n\nWait, in Java, s.charAt(0) gives the first character of the string. Adding 1 to a char in Java promotes it to an int, so 'a' becomes 97, adding 1 gives 98, which is 'b' when cast back to char.\n\nIn Fortran, characters can be manipulated using their ASCII values via the IACHAR and ACHAR functions. So, for the input string, take the first character, get its ASCII code, add 1, then convert back to a character.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nRead the input line into a variable. Then, extract the first character. Compute the next character. Then write it out.\n\nNow, in Fortran, when reading with READ(*, '(A)'), the variable needs to be a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say we read into a variable of length 1, but maybe the input could have more characters. Wait, but the Java code reads the entire line but takes only the first character. So in Fortran, reading a single character would suffice, but perhaps the input might have more. So maybe read the entire line, then take the first character.\n\nWait, in Java, s = r.readLine() reads the entire line. Then s.charAt(0) takes the first character.
