  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The program counts the number of triplets of characters 'R', 'G', 'B' such that they are not all the same and their positions are not forming an arithmetic sequence (i.e., j - i = k - j for some j between i and k). \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n and a string s. Then, it counts the occurrences of each color. The initial result is the product of the counts of R, G, and B. Then, it subtracts the cases where there's a triplet that forms an arithmetic sequence but all three are different.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to handle input/output, loops, and character handling. Let me outline the steps.\n\n1. Read the integer n and the string s. In Fortran, reading a string after an integer can be tricky. The string length in the problem is n, so maybe read a string of length n.\n\n2. Count the number of R, G, B. Loop through each character in the string and increment counters accordingly.\n\n3. Compute the initial result as rc * gc * bc.\n\n4. Then, for each pair i and k, check if (i + k) is even. If so, calculate j = (i +k)/2. Then check if the three characters are all different. If yes, decrement the result.\n\nWait, the Java code loops i from 1 to n, and k from i+1 to n. But since in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default, but the original Java code uses 0-based for the string. Let's see: in Java, s is 0-based. So when i runs from 1 to n (inclusive?), but in the code, the for loops are for i from 1 to n. Wait, the first loop in Java is for (int i=1; i<=n; i++)? Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nWait the first loop is for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++), which loops over each character. Then, the second loops are for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) and k = i+1 to n. Because n is the length of the string. So in Java, i and k are 1-based indexes here. Then, when accessing s.charAt(i-1), which is 0-based. So in Fortran, the string can be 1-based, so maybe the code can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the Fortran steps.\n\nIn Fortran, when you read the string, it's 1-based. So for each i from 1 to n, and k from i+1 to n. Then, check if (i +k) is even. If yes, compute j = (i +k)/2. Then check if the three characters at positions i, j, k are all different. If so, subtract 1 from the result.\n\nSo translating the loops:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    for (int k = i + 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        if ((i + k) % 2 == 0) {\n            int j = (i + k) / 2;\n            char is = s.charAt(i-1);\n            char ks = s.charAt(k-1);\n            char js = s.charAt(j-1);\n            if (is != ks && ks != js && js != is) {\n                result--;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn Fortran, since the string is 1-based, the i and k loop variables can directly index into s. So when i is 1 in Fortran, s(i) is the first character, which matches the Java code's i-1 when i starts at 1.\n\nSo the Fortran loops would be:\n\ndo i=1, n\n    do k = i+1, n\n        if (mod(i + k, 2) == 0 then\n            j = (i + k) / 2\n            if (s(i:i) /= s(k:k) .and. s(k:k) /= s(j:j) .and. s(j:j) /= s(i:i)) then\n                result = result - 1\n            endif\n        endif\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut wait, j has to be between i and k. Since k is i+1 and beyond, and j is (i +k)/2. For example, if i=1, k=3, then j=2. So yes, j is between i and k. So that's correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, character variables can be compared directly. So s(i:i) is the i-th character.\n\nNow, handling the initial counts:\n\nIn Java, rc, gc, bc are counts of R, G, B. In Fortran, we can do the same by looping through each character from 1 to n, checking each character and incrementing the counters.\n\nFor example:\n\nrc = 0\ngc = 0\nbc = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (s(i:i) == 'R') then\n        rc = rc + 1\n    else if (s(i:i) == 'G') then\n        gc = gc + 1\n    else\n        bc = bc + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, compute result = rc * gc * bc.\n\nNow, for the data types: in Java, these are long variables. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) to represent 64-bit integers, which is similar to Java's long. So declare rc, gc, bc, result as integer*8.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, for the input: the user enters n, then a string of length n. In Fortran, reading the string can be done with a format specifier, like reading a character variable of length n.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading with *, it may read the next token. So perhaps read the integer n first, then read the string. However, the problem is that after reading n, the next line is the string, but if the user enters them on the same line, we need to handle that. For example, if input is:\n\n3\nRGB\n\nThen in Fortran, reading with read(*,*) n, then read(*,'(A)') s would work. But if the input is given as a single line (e.g., in some cases), but according to the problem statement, probably the input is n followed by s on the next line. So code:\n\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s  ! assuming n is up to 200000 or similar, but in the problem statement, it's up to 4000 (since original code uses n as the length, and the code in Java uses s.length(), which is n). So perhaps the string's length is n. So to read a string of exactly n characters, perhaps:\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut then, s may have trailing spaces. So better to read exactly n characters. So:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading with '(A)', it will read the entire line, but we need exactly n characters. So perhaps read into a variable of length n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps declare s as a string of length 4000 (if n can be up to 4000). But for generality, it's better to allocate it based on n.\n\nWait, the original problem's constraints: the code reads n as the length of the string. So n is the length of s. So in the Java code, after reading n, s is read as a string of length exactly n. So in Fortran, after reading n, read a string of exactly n characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string, leading spaces are included. So if the input is, for example, n=3 and s is \"RGB\", then reading with read(*, '(A)') s (where s is declared as character(len=3)) would read the three characters. But if the user enters leading spaces, that's part of the string. So perhaps in the problem, s is given as exactly n characters with no leading/trailing spaces.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut wait, when you read with '(A)', it will read all characters up to the newline, possibly including leading spaces. So for example, if the user enters the string as \"  RGB\" (with leading spaces), but n is 3, then the code would have s as '  R' which is incorrect. However, according to the problem statement, the input string should be of length exactly n, so perhaps we can assume that the input is properly formatted, and read the first n characters from the input line. So perhaps read the entire line and take the first n characters.\n\nBut handling that in Fortran may be a bit tricky. An alternative approach is to read the string into a variable longer than n and then take the first n characters. But perhaps using the format '(A)' reads the entire line, and then we take s(1:n). But if the input line has less than n characters, it will be padded with spaces. But according to the problem's constraints, the input string should be exactly length n. So perhaps proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut in Fortran, when s is declared as a character of length n, and the input line has more than n characters, only the first n are stored. If it has less, it's padded with spaces. But in the problem, the string should be exactly n characters. So this should work.\n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, k, j\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n    integer(kind=8) :: rc, gc, bc, result\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(character(n) :: s)\n    read(*, '(A)') s\n\n    ! Count R, G, B\n    rc = 0\n    gc = 0\n    bc = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (s(i:i) == 'R') then\n            rc = rc + 1\n        else if (s(i:i) == 'G') then\n            gc = gc + 1\n        else\n            bc = bc + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    result = rc * gc * bc\n\n    ! Subtract invalid triplets\n    do i = 1, n\n        do k = i + 1, n\n            if (mod(i + k, 2) == 0) then\n                j = (i + k) / 2\n                if (j > k .or. j < i) then  ! Wait, j is between i and k?\n                    ! Since i < k and j = (i +k)/2, then j >= i and j <= k. Because i < k. For example, i=1, k=3: j=2. So j is between. So this check is redundant. Can remove.\n                    cycle\n                end if\n                if (s(i:i) /= s(k:k) .and. s(k:k) /= s(j:j) .and. s(j:j) /= s(i:i)) then\n                    result = result - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, result\n\n    deallocate(s)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the original code, j is calculated as (i + k)/2, and since i and k are integers with i < k, if (i +k) is even, then j is an integer. And j will be between i and k. So the check for j >k or j <i is unnecessary. So that part can be omitted. So the code in the do loop for i and k is:\n\nif (mod(i + k, 2) == 0) then\n    j = (i + k)/2\n    if (s(i:i) /= s(k:k) .and. s(k:k) /= s(j:j) .and. s(j:j) /= s(i:i)) then\n        result = result - 1\n    end if\nend if\n\nSo the code can be written as such.\n\nTesting this code. Let's see sample input.\n\nFor example, if input is 3 and s is RGB. Then:\n\nrc=1, gc=1, bc=1. Initial result is 1*1*1=1.\n\nThen, the loops:\n\ni=1:\n\nk=2: i+k=3, mod 3 by 2 is 1. So no.\n\nk=3: i=1, k=3. i+k=4, mod 2 is 0. j=2.\n\nCheck s(1) R, s(3) B, s(2) G. All different. So result becomes 0.\n\nSo the output is 0. Which matches the case where the triplet (1,2,3) forms an arithmetic sequence and all are different. Thus the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, s= RGBG. Then rc=2, gc=2, bc=0. Initial result is 2*2*0=0. So output is 0.\n\nIn the code, even if there are arithmetic triplets, since bc is 0, the initial product is 0 and the subtraction doesn't matter.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as above."
