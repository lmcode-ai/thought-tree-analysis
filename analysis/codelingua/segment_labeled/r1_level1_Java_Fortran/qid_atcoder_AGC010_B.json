N-1 : i-1. So for each i (0-based), j is previous index, except when i=0, j is N-1 (the last element). So in Fortran, which is 1-based, when i=1, j is N. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So need to adjust. Wait, Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n   int j = i == 0 ? N-1 : i-1;\n   long d = K - (A[i] - A[j]);\n   ...\n}\n\nSo for each element in 0-based array, j is the previous index (circular).

So perhaps we need to calculate sum as a 64-bit integer. Therefore, in the possible function, declare sum as integer(kind=8), and compute sum by looping through the array elements and adding each to sum, or convert each element to 64-bit before adding. Alternatively, if we declare A as integer(kind=8), then sum is 64-bit. So in the main program, when reading A, we should read them as integer(kind=8). Or maybe the problem allows A to be 4-byte integers, but sum could be larger, so better to use 8-byte for sum and K.\n\nSo in the possible function:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_A, NS, K, d\n\nsum_A = sum(A) would be okay if A is default integer, but sum may overflow.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the main function reads an integer N from the input, then reads N integers into an array A. Then it calls the possible function to check some conditions. If possible returns true, it prints YES, else NO.\n\nLooking at the possible function: It calculates the sum of the array. Then computes NS as N*(N+1)/2. Checks if the sum is divisible by NS. If not, returns false. Then K is sum divided by NS. Then for each element in the array, it checks the difference between current and previous element (with wrap-around for i=0, previous is last element), subtracts K, and checks if the result is non-negative and divisible by N.\n\nHmm, so the key steps are:\n\n1. Compute sum of A.\n2. Check sum mod (N*(N+1)/2) is zero.\n3. Compute K = sum / (N*(N+1)/2).\n4. For each element, check K - (A[i] - A[j]) must be non-negative and divisible by N, where j is previous index (circular).\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, the main program. Fortran uses read statements. So read N, then read A array.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to declare variables. For example, N is an integer, A is an array of integers. But wait, in Java, A is integers, but in the possible function, there are operations that may involve larger numbers. For example, sum could be a long in Java. In Fortran, perhaps using integer(kind=8) for sum and K to handle large numbers.\n\nSo variables:\n\nIn the main program:\n\ninteger :: N\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:)\nlogical :: res\n\nThen read N, then allocate A(N), then read A.\n\nThen call the possible function with N, A, and return a logical res. Then print YES or NO based on res.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can return logical. So possible function would be a logical function.\n\nNow, the possible function:\n\nsum is a long in Java, so in Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) to handle large integers. Let's see:\n\nsum = sum of A, which is integer array. So sum needs to be integer(kind=8). Similarly, NS is N*(N+1)/2, which could be large, so also integer(kind=8). K is sum/NS, which is integer.\n\nThen, for each i, compute j as i-1, but when i=1 (Fortran starts at 1?), wait in Java the array is 0-based. Wait, in Java, the code for j is: i==0 ? N-1 : i-1. So for each i (0-based), j is previous index, except when i=0, j is N-1 (the last element). So in Fortran, which is 1-based, when i=1, j is N. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So need to adjust.\n\nWait, Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n   int j = i == 0 ? N-1 : i-1;\n   long d = K - (A[i] - A[j]);\n   ...\n}\n\nSo for each element in 0-based array, j is the previous index (circular). So in Fortran's 1-based, for i from 1 to N:\n\nif i is 1, then j is N. Otherwise, j is i-1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n   if (i == 1) then\n      j = N\n   else\n      j = i -1\n   end if\n   d = K - (A(i) - A(j))\n   ... checks\nend do\n\nNow, the variables in the possible function:\n\nsum is calculated as sum(A). But in Fortran, sum(A) returns the sum as the same kind as A. If A is integer(4), sum could be integer(4). But if the sum is large, this could cause overflow. So perhaps we need to calculate sum as a 64-bit integer.\n\nTherefore, in the possible function, declare sum as integer(kind=8), and compute sum by looping through the array elements and adding each to sum, or convert each element to 64-bit before adding.\n\nAlternatively, if we declare A as integer(kind=8), then sum is 64-bit. So in the main program, when reading A, we should read them as integer(kind=8). Or maybe the problem allows A to be 4-byte integers, but sum could be larger, so better to use 8-byte for sum and K.\n\nSo in the possible function:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_A, NS, K, d\n\nsum_A = sum(A) would be okay if A is default integer, but sum may overflow. So perhaps better to accumulate sum in a 64-bit variable.\n\nWait, in Java, A is an int array. So each element is a 32-bit integer. Summing them into a long (64-bit). So in Fortran, to avoid overflow, sum_A should be integer(8), and each element of A should be added as integer(8).\n\nBut when we read A in Fortran, if we declare it as integer(4), then sum in integer(8) would be correct if each element is converted to 8 bytes. So perhaps in the possible function:\n\nsum_A = 0\ndo i = 1, N\n   sum_A = sum_A + int(A(i), 8)\nend do\n\nThat way, even if A is integer(4), sum is 64-bit.\n\nSo possible function steps:\n\n1. Compute sum_A as sum of A elements converted to 64-bit.\n\n2. Compute NS = N * (N + 1) / 2 (as 64-bit integer).\n\n3. Check if sum_A mod NS is not zero: return false.\n\n4. K = sum_A / NS.\n\n5. For each i in 1..N:\n\n   a. j = N if i==1, else i-1.\n\n   b. compute d = K - (A(i) - A(j)).\n\n   c. if d <0 or mod(d, N) /=0, return false.\n\n6. return true.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: N=1? Let's see. NS would be 1*2/2=1. Then sum must be K*1. Then for i=1, j=1 (since i=1, j=N=1). d= K - (A(1)-A(1)) = K. So check K >=0 and K mod 1 ==0. Which is always true if sum is K*1. So possible for N=1.\n\nNow, handling the variables:\n\nIn Fortran, the function possible will take N and A as arguments. But in Fortran, when passing arrays, the size can be passed as a separate argument.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\nlogical function possible(N, A) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: N\n    integer, intent(in) :: A(N)\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum_A, NS, K, d\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    sum_A = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        sum_A = sum_A + int(A(i), 8)\n    end do\n\n    NS = int(N, 8) * (int(N, 8) + 1) / 2\n    if (mod(sum_A, NS) /= 0) then\n        res = .false.\n        return\n    end if\n    K = sum_A / NS\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (i == 1) then\n            j = N\n        else\n            j = i - 1\n        end if\n        d = K - (int(A(i), 8) - int(A(j), 8))\n        if (d < 0 .or. mod(d, int(N, 8)) /= 0) then\n            res = .false.\n            return\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    res = .true.\nend function possible\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have a logical function, you can return using the result variable. So the function starts with logical function possible(...) result(res), and then assign res accordingly.\n\nBut in Java's code, the possible function returns a boolean, which is either true or false.\n\nNow, considering the data types. If A is declared as integer in the main program (default kind, which is usually 4), then when we pass it to possible, the function's A is integer(4) array. But when converting to 8-byte integers, like in sum_A and d, we need to cast each element to 8-byte. So in the loop, sum_A is 0 (int8), then each A(i) is converted to 8-byte and added.\n\nSimilarly, NS is computed using N as 8-byte. So N is integer(4) in main, but when converted to 8-byte in NS calculation.\n\nSo in the possible function:\n\nNS = int(N, 8) * (int(N, 8) + 1_8) / 2_8\n\nWait, let's compute NS:\n\nIn Java code, NS is (long) N*(N+1)/2.\n\nIn Fortran, if N is integer(4), converting to 8-byte. So:\n\nNS = (int(N, 8) * (int(N,8) + 1)) / 2\n\nBut need to make sure that the multiplication is done in 8-byte to avoid overflow.\n\nSimilarly, K is sum_A / NS. Both are 8-byte, so division is integer division.\n\nThen for each element, when computing A(i) - A(j), since A is 4-byte, the subtraction is 4-byte, but converting to 8-byte.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code is:\n\nA[i] - A[j] is int subtraction (32-bit), then promoted to long (64-bit) when subtracted from K (which is long).\n\nSo in Fortran, to avoid overflow, we need to cast each A(i) to 8-byte before subtracting.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nd = K - (int(A(i),8) - int(A(j),8))\n\nYes, that's important. Because if A(i) and A(j) are large (like 1e9 each), their difference could be up to 2e9, which is within 32-bit, but if A is stored as 4-byte, but when converted to 8-byte, no problem.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each A(i) and A(j), cast to 8-byte before subtraction.\n\nSo that's handled in the code.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nRead N, then read N integers into array A.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:)\n    logical :: possible\n    integer :: i\n\n    read(*, *) N\n    allocate(A(N))\n    read(*, *) A\n\n    if (possible(N, A)) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(A)\nend program main\n\nBut wait, the possible function is a function in Fortran. So the main program must have an explicit interface for the possible function. But since possible is a function in the same source file, in Fortran, if the function is after the main program, it needs an interface block. Or, better to have the possible function in a module. But perhaps for simplicity, we can declare the possible function as external and have it in the same file.\n\nAlternatively, since possible is a function with arguments (N, A), where A is an array of size N, the main program can have an implicit interface. But Fortran allows that, though it's not best practice, but works for small code.\n\nAlternatively, we can place the possible function before the main program.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nfunction possible(N, A) result(res)\n    ... code ...\nend function possible\n\nprogram main\n    ... code ...\nend program main\n\nBut in Fortran, the order is important. Functions must be declared before they are used. So the possible function must be before the main program.\n\nWait, no. The main program is the entry point. If the possible function is defined after the main program, then the main program must have an interface block. Otherwise, the compiler might not know about the function's signature.\n\nTo avoid that, perhaps the possible function is written in a module, but for this example, perhaps the code can be written with possible function as an external function. But in that case, the main program must declare the function's return type.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the code so that possible is a module procedure. But perhaps the simplest way is to write the possible function first, then the main program.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nfunction possible(N, A) result(res)\n    ... code ...\nend function\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    ... code ...\nend program\n\nThis way, when the main program uses possible, the function is already known.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the order is: the main program comes after the functions. So possible function is defined first.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the input. The Java code uses Scanner to read N and then N integers. In Fortran, when reading the array A, the read statement expects N integers. So the code in main:\n\nread(*,*) N\nallocate(A(N))\nread(*,*) A\n\nBut if the input is in one line, or in multiple lines, this depends on how the input is formatted. For example, if the input is given as:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen the code works. If the input is given as two lines: first line N, second line N integers.\n\nYes, the read(*, *) N reads the first line, then read(*, *) A reads the second line.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nFor example, the sample input from the problem (if any). Suppose N=3, A=[1,2,3].\n\nBut without knowing the problem statement, it's hard to test, but the code should replicate the logic of the Java code.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the array A is 0-based, while in Fortran it's 1-based. So the code correctly handles the circular previous element by using j = N for i=1, and j = i-1 otherwise.\n\nNow, compiling and testing:\n\nIf the code is written as:\n\nfunction possible(N, A) result(res)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: N\n    integer, intent(in) :: A(N)\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum_A, NS, K, d\n    integer :: i, j\n    logical :: res\n\n    sum_A = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        sum_A = sum_A + int(A(i), 8)\n    end do\n\n    NS = (int(N,8) * (int(N,8) + 1)) / 2\n    if (mod(sum_A, NS) /= 0) then\n        res = .false.\n        return\n    end if\n\n    K = sum_A / NS\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (i == 1) then\n            j = N\n        else\n            j = i - 1\n        end if\n        d = K - (int(A(i),8) - int(A(j),8))\n        if (d < 0 .or. mod(d, int(N,8)) /= 0) then\n            res = .false.\n            return\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    res = .true.\nend function possible\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:)\n    logical :: possible\n\n    read(*, *) N\n    allocate(A(N))\n    read(*, *) A\n\n    if (possible(N, A)) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(A)\nend program main\n\nThis should be the correct translation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Integer overflows: Using 8-byte integers where necessary.\n\n- Handling the circular previous element correctly.\n\n- Division and modulus operations: in Fortran, mod(a,b) with negative a can return a negative remainder. But in Java, the modulus operator % returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. However, in the code, d is computed as K - (A[i] - A[j]), which is a long. Then, if d is negative, return false. Otherwise, check if d mod N is zero.\n\nIn Fortran, mod(d, N) for positive d and N will return the correct modulus. But if d is negative, mod can return a negative value. However, in the code, the check is d <0, so if d is negative, we return false. So the mod is only checked when d is non-negative. So the code should work.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when using mod, the arguments should be of the same kind. So in the code, d is integer(8), N is integer(4). So mod(d, int(N,8)) is necessary.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nmod(d, int(N,8)) /= 0\n\nYes, because N is integer(4), but in the possible function's argument, N is integer(4). So in the loop, when computing mod(d, N), we need to cast N to 8-byte. So the code uses mod(d, int(N,8)).\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
