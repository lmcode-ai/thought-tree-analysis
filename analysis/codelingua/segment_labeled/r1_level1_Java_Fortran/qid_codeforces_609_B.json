  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does.\n\nSo the program reads two integers, n and m. Then it reads an array of n integers, which are the genres of books. The gen array counts how many times each genre appears. The genres are between 1 and m, I suppose. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of books that have different genres. Since each pair (i,j) is counted twice (once as i,k and once as k,i), they divide the total by 2 at the end.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the inputs. In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, I'll use READ statements. The first line reads n and m. Then the array arr of size n, but in Fortran, arrays are static, so I'll have to declare them with a fixed size. Wait, but maybe the input n could be up to some maximum. The original code uses n as the size. Let me check. Wait, the problem probably has constraints, but since the Java code uses dynamic array allocation with new int[n], in Fortran we might have to use an allocatable array. But Fortran 90 and later support allocatable arrays, so that's manageable.\n\nWait, the original code's gen array has size 11. Because in the problem statement, the genres are up to m, which is read from input. Wait, but the Java code initializes gen as size 11. Oh, looking at the code: int gen[] = new int[11]; So it's fixed size 11. But in the problem statement, m can be up to 10, perhaps? Because indexes from 1 to m. But why 11? Because the indexes go from 0 to 10, but the genres are 1-based. So the code uses gen[arr[i]] where arr[i] is between 1 and m. So in Fortran, I need an array of size at least m+1, but wait, the original code uses 11. Oh, perhaps the problem's constraints state that m is up to 10. But since m is input, maybe the Java code has a fixed array size of 11. But in Fortran, we can't do that. So perhaps the Fortran code should have gen dimension (0:10) or something. Wait, but in the original code, the genres can be up to m, which is given as input. So if m is 10, then gen[10] is allowed. But the array gen in Java is size 11, indexes 0-10. So for m up to 10, that's okay. But if m is larger than 10, the code would fail. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that m is <= 10. So the Java code uses gen[11] to handle up to m=10.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, maybe it's better to make gen's size m+1. But since m is read at runtime, we can't have an array size that's variable unless we use an allocatable array. So perhaps in Fortran, we need to declare gen as an array with size up to, say, 100 or whatever maximum is allowed. But the problem's constraints are not given. Alternatively, the original code uses gen[11], so perhaps the Fortran code can use gen(1:10) or 0:10. Wait, in Java, the gen array is initialized to size 11. So indexes 0-10. But the code increments gen[arr[i]], and arr[i] is read as input. So if arr[i] is 1, then gen[1] is incremented. So the Fortran code should have gen from 1 to 10 (assuming m is up to 10). But how to handle that? Because m is read from input, which could be up to 10. So perhaps in Fortran, we can declare gen as dimension(1:10), but if m is 10, that's okay. But if the user inputs m larger than 10, the code would have an array out of bounds. But the original Java code also allows m up to 10, given the gen array size.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, since m is read from input, and the gen array is of size 11 in Java (indexes 0-10), but in practice, the genres are 1 to m. So in Fortran, perhaps the gen array can be declared with indices from 1 to m. But since m is a variable, we need to make it an allocatable array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can have arrays with variable size if they are allocatable. So first, read n and m, then allocate the gen array as 1:m. Then, initialize each element to 0.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the gen array has 11 elements. So even if m is less than 10, the code can handle it. For example, if m is 5, then the gen array is size 11, but only indexes 1-5 are used. The rest (6-10) are zeros and not accessed because the code loops from 1 to m in the double loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the gen array can be declared with size 1:m. Let's adjust accordingly.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read n integers into arr. But in Fortran, we can read them into an array. But the original code uses an array arr of size n, which is dynamic. So in Fortran, we can have an allocatable array for arr.\n\nBut the original code does not process the arr array except to count the frequencies in gen. So maybe we don't need to store the entire array. Wait, in the original code, after reading each element of arr, they increment gen[arr[i]]. So perhaps we can read each element one by one and update gen without storing the entire array.\n\nThat's possible. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read n elements, for each, read a value and increment gen(value). That would save memory, but the original code does store the array. But since the array is not used again after filling gen, perhaps the Fortran code can avoid storing it. Let's see.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    arr[i] = in.nextInt();\n    gen[arr[i]]++;\n}\n\nSo the array arr is stored, but then only used to fill gen. So perhaps in Fortran, we can just read each number into a temporary variable and update gen accordingly. That way, we don't need to allocate an array of size n.\n\nSo that's an optimization. Let's modify that.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nAfter reading n and m, we can allocate gen as an array of size 1:m, initialized to zero.\n\nThen loop i from 1 to n:\n\nread a number temp, then gen(temp) +=1\n\nThis way, we avoid storing the entire array, which is more efficient.\n\nBut the original code uses arr, but perhaps that's necessary? No, because arr is not used again. So in the Fortran code, we can skip storing arr.\n\nThat's better. So, in the Fortran code, instead of storing the array, we can just read each value and update gen.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_609_B\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, temp\ninteger, allocatable :: gen(:)\ninteger(8) :: ans  ! Using 8-byte integer to handle large numbers\ninteger :: k\n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\nallocate(gen(1:m))\ngen = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) temp\n    gen(temp) = gen(temp) + 1\nend do\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, m\n    do k = 1, m\n        if (i /= k) then\n            ans = ans + gen(i) * gen(k)\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nprint *, ans / 2\n\ndeallocate(gen)\n\nend program codeforces_609_B\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loops for i and k run from 1 to m (since in Java, the variables i and k are from 1 to m inclusive). So in Fortran, the loops should do the same.\n\nBut in the Java code, the gen array is of size 11, but in our Fortran code, gen is 1:m. So if m is 10, then gen has 10 elements. But in the original code, m can be up to 10, and gen is size 11 (0-10). But since in the loops, i and k go up to m, which is <=10, then in the Fortran code, it's okay.\n\nBut in the original code, if the input m is larger than 10, the Java code would fail. So perhaps the problem's constraints limit m to 10, so the Fortran code with gen(1:m) is okay.\n\nWait, but the problem statement isn't given here. However, the original Java code uses gen[11], which can handle m up to 10. So the problem must have constraints that m is up to 10. So when translating, the Fortran code's gen array can be of size 1:m, which is better, as it's dynamic based on the input m.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the variables i and k loop from 1 to m, inclusive. So in Fortran, the loops are from 1 to m.\n\nNow, the ans variable is a long in Java, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using integer(8) for ans is appropriate to prevent integer overflow.\n\nThe final step is to print ans divided by 2. Because each pair (i,k) and (k,i) are both counted, so the total is divided by 2. For example, if i=1 and k=2, this pair is counted once, and when i=2 and k=1, again. So total sum is 2 * the actual number of pairs, hence division by 2.\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with / operator, but since ans is even (because each pair is counted twice), the division is exact.\n\nTesting the code: for example, if n=2, m=2, and the two books are 1 and 2. Then gen(1)=1, gen(2)=1. The sum would be (1*1 + 1*1) * 1 (since i=1 and k=2, then i=2 and k=1, but i and k are looped for all 1..m. So for i=1, the k loop runs 1 and 2. When i=1 and k=1, it's skipped. When k=2, add 1*1. For i=2, k runs 1 and 2. When k=2, skipped. When k=1, add 1*1. So total ans is 2, divided by 2 is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=3, books [1,1,2,3]. gen(1)=2, gen(2)=1, gen(3)=1. The pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). But the code counts all pairs where i !=k. So for i=1, k=2 and 3: 2*1 + 2*1 = 4. For i=2, k=1 and 3: 1*2 +1*1=3. For i=3, k=1 and 2:1*2 +1*1=3. Sum is 4+3+3=10. Divided by 2 gives 5. Which is correct: the valid pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) but each unique pair is counted once. Wait, no. Wait, the actual pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). But the actual unique unordered pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). Each of these appears twice in the ordered list. So the total ordered pairs is 2*(3) =6, but the code counts all ordered pairs where i !=k, which is 3*2=6 (for m=3, each of 3 elements can pair with 2 others). Wait, in the code's sum, it's sum over all i and k where i !=k. So for m=3, the number of ordered pairs is 3*2=6. Each pair (i,k) and (k,i) are both counted. The code adds for each such pair gen[i] * gen[k], then divides by 2. So the total is sum_{i !=k} gen[i] * gen[k} / 2. Which equals the number of unordered pairs multiplied by their frequencies.\n\nIn the test case, gen[1]=2, gen[2]=1, gen[3]=1.\n\nSo sum over i !=k: (2*1) + (2*1) + (1*2) + (1*1) + (1*2) + (1*1) ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\ni=1:\n\nk=2: 2*1 =2\n\nk=3: 2*1=2\n\nsum:4\n\ni=2:\n\nk=1: 1*2=2\n\nk=3:1*1=1\n\nsum:3\n\ni=3:\n\nk=1:1*2=2\n\nk=2:1*1=1\n\nsum:3\n\nTotal sum is 4+3+3=10. 10/2=5. The actual number of unordered pairs is (2*1) + (2*1) + (1*1) )= 2+2+1=5. Which matches. So code works.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
