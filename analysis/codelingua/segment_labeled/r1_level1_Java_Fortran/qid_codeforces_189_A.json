Yes, that's correct. Then, the main loops: for each of the three elements in arr, and for j from arr[i] to maxn-1 (4009), set dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - arr[i]) +1). In Fortran, the code would have:\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n    current_a = arr(i)\n    do j = current_a, maxn-1\n        if (dp(j - current_a) /= -huge(0)) then\n            dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current_a) + 1)\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, even if dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE, adding 1 would be MIN_VALUE +1, which is worse.

So in Java, the code just takes the max, which could be MIN_VALUE +1, which is still a very low value, but when you take the max between that and the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n and not initialized), but this depends on the code. Hmm. So in Fortran, when j starts from arr[i], and for each j, the code sets dp(j) to the maximum of its current value and dp(j - arr[i]) +1. But if dp(j - arr[i]) is -huge, then adding 1 would make it a very negative number, which would be worse than the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n and was not set to -huge). But this could lead to an overflow. So perhaps the original code is intended to ignore cases where dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE, but in Java, the code doesn't check. So for example, if j - arr[i] is in the range 0 to n-1, then dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE. So adding 1 to that would make it MIN_VALUE +1, which is still very small. So when taking max with the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n), then the max would be 0. Which is not desired. But perhaps the original code is supposed to process all possible j and use the coins. So if the code's initial approach is wrong, but the problem is to translate it, not to fix it.

Then loops over the three elements in arr, and for each, updates the dp array.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to declare variables, set up the dp array. Let's see. The input is four integers: n, a, b, c. Then the arr array would be [a, b, c]. The dp array will be of size up to 4010, but maybe the original code uses maxn as 4010, but in Java, the dp array is of size maxn, but the loop runs up to dp.length (which is 4010). Wait, in the Java code, they create dp as new int[maxn], which is 4010 elements. Then the loop for j starts from arr[i] to dp.length-1 (since in Java, for j < dp.length, j goes up to dp.length-1). So in Fortran, the dp array should be of size 0 to 4009 (since Java's maxn is 4010, indexes 0 to 4009). But maybe in Fortran, we can make it from 0 to 4000 or something. Wait, the original code initializes dp up to n, but maybe n can be up to 4000? Because the problem probably allows n up to 4000. Let me check the problem statement. Well, the code uses maxn as 4010. So perhaps the maximum possible n is 4000, and maxn is 4010 to avoid index issues. So in Fortran, the dp array should be of size 0:4009 (assuming maxn=4010), but Fortran allows dynamic arrays if we use allocation, but perhaps it's easier to make it a fixed size.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read n, a, b, c.\n2. Create an array arr with a, b, c.\n3. Initialize a dp array of size 0:maxn (like 4000?) Wait, the original code's maxn is 4010, so perhaps in Fortran, the dp array should be up to 4010? Let me check. The original code's dp has length maxn (4010), so indexes 0 to 4009. Then for j starting from arr[i] (which could be up to 4009) to the end (4009). So in Fortran, the dp array needs to be at least size 4009. So declaring it as (0:4009) would make sense.\n\nWait, in the original code, the dp array is of size maxn (4010). So indexes 0 to 4009. So in Fortran, the array should be 0:4009. So maxn is 4010. So let's set maxn as a parameter. So in Fortran, parameter(maxn=4010). Then dimension dp(0:maxn-1). Or perhaps (0:maxn) but no. Let me see. So in Fortran, if you have a parameter maxn=4010, then declaring dp as (0:maxn) would make it 0 to 4010, which is 4011 elements, which is larger than needed. But the Java code uses up to index 4009. So in Fortran, perhaps dp is 0:4009. So maxn=4010. So the parameter is maxn=4010, then the array is dimension dp(0:maxn-1). So:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 4010\ninteger :: dp(0:maxn-1)\n\nYes. That way, the array has 4010 elements, indexes 0 to 4009, matching Java's code.\n\nThen, the initial loop in Java initializes dp[i] to Integer.MIN_VALUE for i < n. Wait, the original code has:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, the dp array is of size maxn (4010), but the loop runs i from 0 to n-1. So for the initial n elements (0 to n-1), set to MIN_VALUE, except dp[0] which is 0. Then, after that, the code proceeds.\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial loop is for (int i=0; i < n; i++) { dp[i] = MIN_VALUE; }, but then after that, the code does the dynamic programming.\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake. Because the code is supposed to compute the maximum number of pieces for a ribbon of length n. So the loop for i from 0 to n-1 would set those entries to MIN_VALUE, but then when j can be up to n. Let's think: the original code's dp[j] represents the maximum number of pieces for length j. So for each j >= a[i], update dp[j] as max of current value or dp[j - a[i]] + 1.\n\nBut in the Java code, the initial loop initializes dp[i] for i < n, but then when j can be up to the length of the dp array. Wait, but the code's main loop is for j starting at arr[i] (each a, b, c) up to dp.length (which is 4010). So in the Java code, after initializing the first n entries (0 to n-1), but the code is computing up to j = 4009. That seems odd. But perhaps the problem expects that the code works for n up to 4000, and the maxn is 4010 to avoid index issues.\n\nBut regardless, I need to replicate the code as it is. So in the Fortran code, after reading n, a, b, c, then the array arr is filled with a, b, c. Then the dp array is initialized: first, all elements up to n-1 (but in Java, the code initializes i from 0 to n-1, but n is the input, which may be up to 4000, but in the code, the dp array is of size 4010). So perhaps in Fortran, the initial loop should set dp(0) = 0, and then for i from 1 to maxn-1, set dp(i) to a very small number. Wait, but the original code's initial loop is for i < n (but not sure why). Wait, the Java code's initial loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\ndp[0] = 0;\n\nWait, no, the code first sets all dp[i] for i from 0 to n-1 to MIN_VALUE, then sets dp[0] = 0. Wait, that's a mistake. Because the loop runs i from 0 to n-1 (since i < n). Then, after that, dp[0] is set to 0. So in Java code, the code first initializes all entries from 0 to n-1 to MIN_VALUE, then sets dp[0] to 0. But that's okay. So the code's logic is:\n\nInitialize all possible positions (up to n-1) to MIN, except dp[0], which is 0. Then, for each of the three possible cuts, update the dp array.\n\nWait, but why n-1? Maybe the original code is incorrect. Because if n is the desired length, then the code is trying to compute dp[n]. But in the Java code, the for loop in the first part initializes i from 0 to n-1. Then, after that, the code processes j up to the length of dp (which is 4010). So in this case, the code might process j up to 4009, which could be larger than n. For example, if n is 5, but a[i] is 3, then j starts from 3, and could process up to 4009. But that's perhaps a mistake. But I'm not here to fix the code, just to translate it as is.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead n, a, b, c.\n\nSet arr(1:3) as a, b, c. Since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Wait, but in the code, the loops are for i in 0..2 (Java's array is 0-based). So maybe in Fortran, we can make arr as 1:3, and loop i from 1 to 3.\n\nBut let's see. The code uses for (int i=0; i <3; i++) to loop through the three elements. So in Fortran, arr can be an array of size 3, and loop from 1 to 3.\n\nThen, the dp array is initialized. First, set all elements to a very small number (like -huge(0)), then set dp(0) = 0.\n\nWait, but the Java code's initial loop sets dp[i] for i <n to MIN_VALUE. Then sets dp[0] = 0. So in Fortran, perhaps first loop from i=0 to n-1, set dp(i) = -huge(0), then set dp(0) =0.\n\nBut wait, in Java, after initializing from 0 to n-1, dp[0] is overwritten to 0. So the code's order is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] to MIN, then set to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Initialize the entire dp array to -huge(0). Or first loop from 0 to n-1 and set them to -huge(0).\n\nWait, in Java code, the code first sets all elements from 0 to n-1 to MIN_VALUE, then sets dp[0] to 0. But after that, the code processes the entire dp array (up to 4009). So perhaps in Fortran, the code should first initialize all elements up to maxn-1 (4009) to -huge(0), then set dp(0) = 0. Because in Java, the initial loop sets up to n-1, but then when j can go up to dp.length-1 (4009), which may be larger than n-1. So perhaps the original code's initial loop is incorrect, but regardless, we need to replicate it.\n\nWait, the original code's initialization is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\ndp[0] =0;\n\nSo only the first n elements (0 to n-1) are initialized to MIN_VALUE, but the rest (n to maxn-1) are left as 0 (since Java initializes int arrays to 0 by default). But then, during the processing of the three coins, the code may access indices beyond n-1, which are initialized to 0, but in the algorithm, that could be a problem.\n\nBut this seems like a possible mistake in the original code. However, the problem might have n such that it's possible to reach the sum exactly, but if the code allows for sums beyond n, perhaps not. But again, the user wants a translation of the code as is.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should:\n\n- Read n, a, b, c.\n\n- Initialize the dp array from 0 to maxn-1 (4009), but the Java code's initial code initializes up to n-1, and leaves the rest as default (0). But in Fortran, variables are not initialized by default. So we need to replicate that.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you declare an array, the elements have undefined values unless initialized. So to replicate Java's code, which initializes the first n elements to MIN_VALUE, then dp[0] to 0, and leaves the rest as 0 (since in Java, the array is initialized with 0s by default, but in the code, the first loop sets the first n elements to MIN, and then overwrites dp[0] to 0. The remaining elements (n to maxn-1) would still be 0 as per Java's array initialization.\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to explicitly set the rest to 0. Or perhaps the original code's logic is that the remaining elements (from n to maxn-1) are 0, which would allow for cases where j exceeds n. But in the problem, the desired length is n, so the code should compute dp[n], but the original code's loops process up to maxn-1, which is 4009, but perhaps the code is designed to handle cases where the sum can exceed n, but that's unlikely.\n\nBut the problem's code's logic is to process all possible j up to maxn-1, but the correct answer is dp[n]. So, regardless of that, to replicate the code, in Fortran:\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Initialize all elements from 0 to n-1 to a very small value (like -huge(0)), then set dp(0) =0.\n\n2. The elements from n to maxn-1 are not initialized in Java (since Java initializes them to 0, but the original code's initial loop only touches 0 to n-1). However, in the code's main loops, when j starts from arr[i], which could be up to 4009, so j can be larger than n. But the original code's dp[j] is set to max(dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] +1). So for j >= arr[i], which could be larger than n.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we don't initialize the elements from n to maxn-1, they'll have undefined values, which is a problem. So to replicate Java's code, which initializes the entire dp array to 0, then the first n elements to MIN, then overwrite dp[0] to 0, perhaps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, initialize the entire dp array to 0.\n\nThen, for i from 0 to n-1, set dp(i) = -huge(0).\n\nThen set dp(0) =0.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the initial array is filled with 0s. Then, the first loop sets 0 to n-1 to MIN. Then, dp[0] is set to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should:\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nThen loop i from 0 to n-1, set dp(i) = -huge(0).\n\nThen set dp(0) =0.\n\nBut how to set the entire dp array to 0 first. In Fortran, you can do dp = 0 in the declaration.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: dp(0:maxn-1) = 0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can initialize variables in the declaration. But perhaps it's better to do it explicitly.\n\nSo:\n\ndp = 0\n\nThen:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n    dp(i) = -huge(0)\nend do\n\ndp(0) =0\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the first loop sets all dp[i] for i <n to MIN_VALUE. Then dp[0] is set to 0.\n\nSo the first loop overwrites dp[0] to MIN_VALUE, then the code sets dp[0] back to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, set all dp to 0.\n\nThen loop i=0 to n-1, set dp(i) = -huge(0).\n\nThen set dp(0) =0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the main loops: for each of the three elements in arr, and for j from arr[i] to maxn-1 (4009), set dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - arr[i]) +1).\n\nIn Fortran, the code would have:\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n    current_a = arr(i)\n    do j = current_a, maxn-1\n        if (dp(j - current_a) /= -huge(0)) then\n            dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current_a) + 1)\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, even if dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE, adding 1 would be MIN_VALUE +1, which is worse. So Java's code doesn't check for that. So in Java, the code just takes the max, which could be MIN_VALUE +1, which is still a very low value, but when you take the max between that and the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n and not initialized), but this depends on the code.\n\nHmm. So in Fortran, when j starts from arr[i], and for each j, the code sets dp(j) to the maximum of its current value and dp(j - arr[i]) +1. But if dp(j - arr[i]) is -huge, then adding 1 would make it a very negative number, which would be worse than the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n and was not set to -huge). But this could lead to an overflow. So perhaps the original code is intended to ignore cases where dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE, but in Java, the code doesn't check. So for example, if j - arr[i] is in the range 0 to n-1, then dp[j - arr[i]] is MIN_VALUE. So adding 1 to that would make it MIN_VALUE +1, which is still very small. So when taking max with the current dp[j], which could be 0 (if j >=n), then the max would be 0. Which is not desired.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is supposed to process all possible j and use the coins. So if the code's initial approach is wrong, but the problem is to translate it, not to fix it.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the code would have:\n\nloop over the three coins (a, b, c)\n\nfor each coin:\n\n   loop j from coin to maxn-1\n\n      dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - coin) + 1)\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to 3 (since arr is size 3), and for each j from arr(i) to maxn-1 (4009).\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\narr(1) = a\n\narr(2) = b\n\narr(3) = c\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n\n    current = arr(i)\n\n    do j = current, maxn-1\n\n        if (dp(j - current) /= -huge(0)) then\n\n            dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current) + 1)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the original Java code doesn't have any condition. So even if dp[j - current] is MIN_VALUE, it still adds 1 and takes the max. So in Fortran, we need to replicate that. So no need for the condition. Because in Java, even if dp[j - current] is MIN_VALUE, adding 1 would be possible, but perhaps it's invalid. But in Fortran, adding 1 to a very large negative number may cause overflow. But in Java, it's allowed.\n\nBut in the code, if j - current is in 0 to n-1, then dp[j - current] is MIN_VALUE, and adding 1 would give a very low value, which would not affect the max since the current dp[j] could be 0 (if j >=n), and thus the max would be 0. But this is not the desired behavior. So the original code may have a bug.\n\nBut since we are translating, not fixing, the code should be as close as possible.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would:\n\nAfter initializing the dp array:\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n\n    current = arr(i)\n\n    do j = current, maxn-1\n\n        dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current) + 1)\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, max is an intrinsic function that takes two arguments.\n\nNow, the Java code's dp[j] is initially set to MIN_VALUE for j <n. So for j >=n, it's 0. Then, for each coin, for j >= coin, the code checks if using that coin gives a better result.\n\nBut in the original code, after processing all coins, the answer is dp[n].\n\nSo, for example, if the code processes coins a, b, c, and for each j, the maximum possible count is computed.\n\nBut this code is designed to find the maximum number of coins to sum up to exactly n. But the way the loops are structured may not be correct. For example, in the original code, the dp array is filled for j up to 4009, but the answer is dp[n], which is part of the initial 0 to n-1 entries if n is 4009. Wait, no. For example, if n is 5, then the initial code initializes j from 0 to 4 (5-1) to MIN. Then, in the loops, j can be up to 4009. But the answer is dp[5], which is in the range 0 to 4009, but in the initial code, the code initializes j from 0 to n-1 (4) to MIN, but the answer is at j=n (5). So after initialization, dp[5] is 0 (since it wasn't initialized to MIN), then during the processing, the code will try to update it.\n\nBut in this case, the code will process j=5 if a, b, or c is <=5. For example, if a is 3, then j starts at 3 and goes up. So j=5 would be processed, and dp[5] = max(0, dp[5-3] +1) = max(0, dp[2]+1). But dp[2] was initialized to MIN, so adding 1 would be a very low number. So the max would be 0. Which is not correct. So the original code is incorrect. But again, the task is to translate the code as is.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the code should proceed as follows.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, a, b, c, i, j, current\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 4010\n\ninteger :: arr(3)\n\ninteger :: dp(0:maxn-1)\n\nRead the inputs:\n\nread(*,*) n, a, b, c\n\narr = [a, b, c]\n\nInitialize dp:\n\ndp = 0\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n\n    dp(i) = -huge(0)\n\nend do\n\ndp(0) = 0\n\nThen, process each coin:\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n\n    current = arr(i)\n\n    do j = current, maxn-1\n\n        dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current) + 1)\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, print dp(n):\n\nprint *, dp(n)\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code prints dp[n], which in Fortran would be dp(n), since indices start at 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you declare dp(0:maxn-1), then the indices are 0 to 4009 (if maxn=4010). So for n, which is the input, dp(n) is the correct index.\n\nSo the code would read n, and then output dp(n).\n\nBut in the case where n is 4009, that's okay.\n\nBut what about integer overflow? For example, in Java, the code uses Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is -2^31. In Fortran, using -huge(0) would give the largest negative integer. For example, in Fortran, huge(0) is the largest positive integer, so -huge(0) -1 would be the smallest, but it depends on the compiler. But assuming that the code uses -huge(0) as the initial value.\n\nBut in Fortran, the intrinsic function huge returns the largest value of the type. So for integer, -huge(0) is -2147483647 if using 4-byte integers (which is common). But Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE is -2147483648. So there is a difference. But perhaps in the original code, the value is just a very small number. So for Fortran, using -huge(0) would be acceptable.\n\nBut in Fortran, the initialization of dp is:\n\ndp = 0\n\nThen, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\ndp(i) = -huge(0)\n\nThen, set dp(0) =0.\n\nSo, the code after this will have:\n\ndp(0) =0\n\ndp(1) to dp(n-1) = -huge(0)\n\ndp(n) to dp(maxn-1) =0 (since they were set to 0 in the initial dp=0, but the loop from i=0 to n-1 overwrites only up to n-1).\n\nThen, the main loops process each coin.\n\nSo, for example, if the coin is a=2:\n\nFor j from 2 to 4009:\n\ndp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j-2) +1)\n\nSo for j=2, dp(2) = max(0, dp(0)+1) = max(0, 1) =1.\n\nFor j=3, if a=1, then dp(3) would be max(0, dp(2)+1) = max(0, 1+1)=2.\n\nBut in our example, after initializing, for j >=n, dp(j) is 0. So if the code's dp(n) is 0, but the loops could update it if there's a way to reach n.\n\nBut in the original code, the answer is dp(n), which was initialized to 0 if n >= maxn (but maxn is 4010, and the input n is probably up to 4000). So the code may work.\n\nBut the original code's logic is flawed. However, the translation should proceed.\n\nSo, the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_189_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, c, i, j, current\n    integer, parameter :: maxn = 4010\n    integer :: arr(3)\n    integer :: dp(0:maxn-1)\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b, c\n    arr = [a, b, c]\n\n    ! Initialize dp array\n    dp = 0\n    do i = 0, n-1\n        dp(i) = -huge(0)\n    end do\n    dp(0) = 0\n\n    ! Process each of the three possible cuts\n    do i = 1, 3\n        current = arr(i)\n        do j = current, maxn-1\n            dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j - current) + 1)\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, dp(n)\nend program codeforces_189_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have dp(j - current), j starts from current, so j - current starts from 0. For example, j=current, j - current =0, which is allowed.\n\nBut the code in Fortran uses arr(i), which is a, b, c. But what if one of them is zero? Well, in the problem statement, probably the inputs are positive integers.\n\nBut in the original code, the arr is [a, b, c], which are input values, but in the code, j starts from arr[i], which could be zero, but in that case, j would start from 0. But the code's original logic would process j=0, but for j=0, current is zero, j - current is 0, and dp(0) is 0. So dp(0) would be max(0, 0+1) =1. But dp(0) is set to 0, so it would become 1. Which is wrong. But again, the code is as per the user's request.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code is for codeforces 189 A. Looking up the problem, the problem is to cut a ribbon of length n into pieces of lengths a, b, c. The code is supposed to compute the maximum number of pieces. So the code must be correct, but perhaps the original Java code has a bug. But again, our task is to translate, not to fix.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code may have a mistake in the loop. For example, when current is zero, j starts from zero. So j runs from 0 to maxn-1, but current is zero, then j - current is j, so dp(j) = max(dp(j), dp(j) +1). Which would be max(x, x+1) \u2192 x+1. But if x is -huge(0), adding 1 would overflow. But in Java, it's allowed. In Fortran, integer overflow is undefined, but it's possible that the code would have issues. However, the problem probably ensures that a, b, c are positive integers, so current is positive.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code is as above."
