Wait, no: the for loop in Java has three parts: initialization (j=5, k=N-i), condition (k >=0), update (j +=2, k -=i). The body is the code inside. So the loop runs as:\n\n1. Initialize j=5, k=N-i.\n\n2. Check if k >=0. If not, exit. 3. Execute loop body. 4. After body, j +=2, k -=i. So in the loop body, the code is:\n\nif (cost > ans) break;\n\ncost += ...;\n\nThen j and k are updated. Wait, in Java, the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (cost > ans) break;\n\ncost += j * ...; Then, after the body, j and k are updated (j +=2, k -=i). So the order is: check if cost exceeds ans, if so, break. Otherwise, add the term. Then update j and k, then check the condition again. So the Fortran code would need to structure the loop similarly. So perhaps:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\nloop: do\n\n   if (k <0) exit loop\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit loop\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do loop\n\nWait, but after adding the term, j and k are updated. Then the next iteration checks if k >=0 again. But in Java, the loop condition is checked before each iteration, after the update. Wait, no. The for loop's structure is:\n\nfor (init; condition; update) { body }\n\nThe steps are: 1. init. 2. check condition. If false, exit loop. 3. execute body. 4. execute update. 5. go to step 2. So in Java, after the body is executed, the update (j +=2, k -=i) is done, then the condition is checked again. Thus, in the Fortran loop, after the body, j and k are updated, then check if k >=0. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo\n\n   if (k <0) exit\n\n   ! body\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(max(k -i,0)))\n\n   ! update j and k\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the order here is: first check if k <0, then check if cost exceeds ans, then add the term, then update j and k. But the Java code first checks k >=0, then executes the body (including the break if cost exceeds), then updates j and k. So in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop as: Initialize j and k. Do while (k >=0):\n\n   check if cost > ans: if yes, break.\n\n   add the term. update j and k. So the loop would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo while (k >=0)\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, the loop condition is checked before entering the body. So even if after the update, k becomes negative, the loop will check again. But in Java, the loop continues as long as k >=0. So after updating j and k, the next iteration's condition is checked. So the Fortran code as written will check k >=0 each time, and if it's not, the loop exits. But the Java code's for loop condition is checked after the update. So in Java, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize j and k.\n\n2. Check k >=0. If not, exit loop. 3. Execute loop body. 4. Update j and k (j +=2, k -=i). 5. Check k >=0 again, etc. So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo\n\n   if (k <0) exit\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, no.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads N and X from input. Then it reads an array x of N elements. There's a prefix sum array xsum where xsum[i+1] is the sum of the first i elements of x. The initial answer is calculated as X multiplied by N plus 5 times the total sum of x. Then, for each i from 1 to N-1, it calculates a cost, which starts as X*i plus 5 times the sum of the last i elements. Then, in a loop with j starting at 5 and increasing by 2 each step, and k starting at N-i and decreasing by i each time, it adds j multiplied by the sum of a segment of the x array. If the cost exceeds the current answer, it breaks out of the loop. After processing all possible k values, it updates the answer with the minimum between ans and cost. Finally, it prints ans plus N*X. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the initial ans is X*N +5*sum, then in the loop, after computing cost for each i, it does ans = min(ans, cost). Then at the end, it prints ans + N*X? Wait, that seems like a mistake. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the original Java code:\n\nThe initial ans is set to X*N +5*xsum[N]. Then in the loop, for each i, compute cost = X*i +5*(xsum[N] -xsum[N-i]). Then, the inner loop adds j*(xsum[k] -xsum[max(k-i,0)]). Then ans is min(ans, cost). Finally, it prints ans + N*X. Wait, that's strange. Because the initial ans includes N*X, and then in the end, it adds N*X again. That seems incorrect. Wait, that must be a bug in the original Java code. Because the initial ans is X*N (which is N*X) plus 5*sum. Then, when calculating cost, it's X*i plus 5*(sum of last i elements). Then, after adding the inner loops, it compares and keeps the minimum. Finally, the code outputs ans + N*X. So that would be adding N*X again. That's probably a mistake. But maybe I'm missing something. Or maybe the original code has a bug, and the correct approach would be to not add N*X again. Hmm. But since I'm supposed to translate the code as is, even if it has a bug, I should replicate that behavior in Fortran.\n\nSo the Java code's output is ans + N*X. But ans was initialized to X*N +5*sum, and then possibly modified to lower values. So adding N*X again would be incorrect. But perhaps the original code is correct, and perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, I need to replicate it as per the code.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses static typing, so variables need to be declared. Let's see the variables in the Java code:\n\n- N is an integer, X is a long (but in Java, long is 64-bit integer, but in the code, x is read as nextInt, but stored in a long array. Wait, the Java code uses sc.nextInt() for x[i], but stores them in a long array. So x is a long array. So in Fortran, we'll use integer kind=8 for those variables.\n\nSo variables:\n\nN is integer.\n\nX is a long integer (kind=8).\n\nx is an array of long integers (size N).\n\nxsum is a prefix sum array of size N+1, long integers.\n\nans is a long integer, initialized to X*N +5*xsum(N+1) (since in Java xsum[N] is the sum up to index N, which in Fortran would be xsum(N+1) if xsum starts at 1).\n\nWait, in Java, xsum is initialized as new long[N+1], with xsum[0] = 0, and xsum[i+1] = xsum[i] + x[i]. So xsum has N+1 elements. For i from 0 to N. So in Fortran, if we index from 1 to N+1, then xsum(1) would correspond to xsum[0], but probably better to adjust the indices. Let me think: in Java, xsum[0] =0, xsum[1] =x[0], xsum[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. So for Fortran, perhaps the xsum array should be of size (0:N), where xsum(0) is 0, xsum(1) is x(1), etc. Wait, but in Fortran, arrays can start at 0. So perhaps:\n\nIn Java, xsum is of size N+1, with indices 0 to N.\n\nIn Fortran, xsum is declared as xsum(0:N), and similarly for the x array, which in Java is from 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, x would be declared as x(1:N) if we start from 1, but perhaps 0-based.\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based indexing, but you can specify any starting index. So for ease of translation, perhaps declare x as x(0:N-1), so that x(0) corresponds to Java's x[0]. Then xsum(0:N), with xsum(0) =0, xsum(1) =x(0), xsum(2) =x(0)+x(1), etc. So that's the same as Java's code.\n\nSo first, in Fortran, after reading N and X, read the x array as N elements, then compute xsum.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables must be declared with the correct types. So N is integer, X is integer (but in Java it's a long, which is 64-bit, so in Fortran, we should use integer(kind=8)).\n\nSo, variable declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: N, X\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: x(:), xsum(:)\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans, cost, i, j, k, temp_k, current_sum\ninteger :: max_iter\n\nBut wait, the code uses loops with i, j, k as int, but in Java they can be int as long as N is small. But in Fortran, variables used in loops should be integers.\n\nBut when handling large numbers, we need to use 8-byte integers. So N and X are read as integers (but in Java, X is read as nextLong, so X is a long, which in Fortran is integer(kind=8)).\n\nSo first, read N and X. Then read x array.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read using read *, N, X. Then allocate x(N), read x.\n\nCompute xsum(0:N), where xsum(0) =0, xsum(i+1) =xsum(i) +x(i).\n\nWait, in Java, xsum[i+1] =xsum[i] + x[i], where x is 0-based. So xsum[0] is 0, xsum[1] is x[0], xsum[2] is x[0]+x[1], etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, xsum(0) =0, xsum(1) =x(1) if x is 1-based. Wait, no, in Java, x is 0-based. So in Fortran, if x is 0-based (from 0 to N-1), then xsum(0) =0, xsum(1) =x(0), xsum(2) =x(0)+x(1), etc. So in Fortran:\n\nxsum(0) =0\n\ndo i =0, N-1\n\n   xsum(i+1) =xsum(i) + x(i)\n\nend do\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nallocate(x(0:N-1))\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n\n   read *, x(i)\n\nend do\n\nallocate(xsum(0:N))\n\nxsum(0) =0\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n\n   xsum(i+1) =xsum(i) + x(i)\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the setup.\n\nThe initial ans is X*N +5*xsum(N). Because xsum in Java is xsum[N], which in Fortran is xsum(N).\n\nThen, for i in 1..N-1 (Java code: for (int i=1; i<N; i++)).\n\nIn Fortran, loops are inclusive, so do i=1, N-1.\n\nFor each i, compute cost = X*i +5*(xsum(N) -xsum(N-i)).\n\nThen, in the inner loop: j starts at 5, increases by 2 each step. k starts at N-i, decreases by i each step. The loop continues while k >=0.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int j=5, k=N-i; k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\n   if (cost > ans) break;\n\n   cost += j * (xsum[k] -xsum[Math.max(k-i, 0)]);\n\n}\n\nSo, how to translate this into Fortran. The loop variables j and k are updated each iteration. In Fortran, this can be done with a do while loop.\n\nSo:\n\nj =5\n\nk =N -i\n\ndo while (k >=0)\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the order in Java is: first check if cost exceeds ans, then add j*(xsum[k] -xsum[max(k-i, 0)]), then increment j and decrement k by i. Wait, no: the for loop in Java has three parts: initialization (j=5, k=N-i), condition (k >=0), update (j +=2, k -=i). The body is the code inside.\n\nSo the loop runs as:\n\n1. Initialize j=5, k=N-i.\n\n2. Check if k >=0. If not, exit.\n\n3. Execute loop body.\n\n4. After body, j +=2, k -=i.\n\nSo in the loop body, the code is:\n\nif (cost > ans) break;\n\ncost += ...;\n\nThen j and k are updated.\n\nWait, in Java, the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (cost > ans) break;\n\ncost += j * ...;\n\nThen, after the body, j and k are updated (j +=2, k -=i).\n\nSo the order is: check if cost exceeds ans, if so, break. Otherwise, add the term. Then update j and k, then check the condition again.\n\nSo the Fortran code would need to structure the loop similarly.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\nloop: do\n\n   if (k <0) exit loop\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit loop\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do loop\n\nWait, but after adding the term, j and k are updated. Then the next iteration checks if k >=0 again.\n\nBut in Java, the loop condition is checked before each iteration, after the update. Wait, no. The for loop's structure is:\n\nfor (init; condition; update) { body }\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. init.\n\n2. check condition. If false, exit loop.\n\n3. execute body.\n\n4. execute update.\n\n5. go to step 2.\n\nSo in Java, after the body is executed, the update (j +=2, k -=i) is done, then the condition is checked again.\n\nThus, in the Fortran loop, after the body, j and k are updated, then check if k >=0.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo\n\n   if (k <0) exit\n\n   ! body\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(max(k -i,0)))\n\n   ! update j and k\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the order here is: first check if k <0, then check if cost exceeds ans, then add the term, then update j and k. But the Java code first checks k >=0, then executes the body (including the break if cost exceeds), then updates j and k. So in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop as:\n\nInitialize j and k.\n\nDo while (k >=0):\n\n   check if cost > ans: if yes, break.\n\n   add the term.\n\n   update j and k.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo while (k >=0)\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, the loop condition is checked before entering the body. So even if after the update, k becomes negative, the loop will check again.\n\nBut in Java, the loop continues as long as k >=0. So after updating j and k, the next iteration's condition is checked.\n\nSo the Fortran code as written will check k >=0 each time, and if it's not, the loop exits.\n\nBut the Java code's for loop condition is checked after the update. So in Java, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize j and k.\n\n2. Check k >=0. If not, exit loop.\n\n3. Execute loop body.\n\n4. Update j and k (j +=2, k -=i).\n\n5. Check k >=0 again, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo\n\n   if (k <0) exit\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Because in Java, the loop's condition is checked before each iteration (including the first one). So in Java, the loop runs as:\n\n- j=5, k=N-i.\n\n- Check if k >=0. If yes, run the body. If not, exit.\n\nAfter running the body, j and k are updated, then check again.\n\nSo the Fortran code should start with the initial j and k, check if k >=0, then proceed.\n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo while (k >=0)\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Because in Java, after the loop body, j and k are updated, then the condition is checked again. So the loop in Fortran would need to run as:\n\nloop: do\n\n   if (k <0) exit loop\n\n   ! body here\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit loop\n\n   ! compute and add to cost\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   ! update j and k\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do loop\n\nBut this is not exactly the same as Java's for loop. Because in Java, the update happens after the body, and then the condition is checked again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a do-while loop with the condition at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fortran code should be:\n\nj =5\n\nk = N -i\n\ndo\n\n   if (k <0) exit\n\n   if (cost > ans) exit\n\n   temp_k = max(k -i, 0)\n\n   cost = cost + j * (xsum(k) - xsum(temp_k))\n\n   j = j +2\n\n   k = k -i\n\nend do\n\nBut in this code, the loop will run as long as after the update, k is >=0. No, because the exit is checked before processing the body. Wait, no. The code is:\n\nj=5, k =N -i.\n\nEnter the loop:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck if k <0: no.\n\nCheck if cost > ans: if yes, exit.\n\nOtherwise, compute the term, add to cost.\n\nThen j +=2, k -=i.\n\nThen repeat the loop.\n\nWait, the code in the loop will:\n\n- Check if k is <0 (initial k) and exit if so.\n\n- Then check cost > ans, exit if so.\n\n- Then add the term.\n\n- Update j and k.\n\nThen loop again, checking if k (now after update) is <0.\n\nSo this is not exactly the same as Java's for loop.\n\nIn Java's for loop:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nInitial j=5, k=N-i.\n\nCheck k >=0: if yes, enter loop body.\n\nAfter loop body, update j and k, then check k >=0 again.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, after adding the term, j and k are updated. Then the loop checks again if the new k is >=0.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose in Java:\n\nk starts at 10, i=3.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck k >=0: yes.\n\nExecute body.\n\nUpdate j +=2, k -=3 (k becomes 7).\n\nCheck k >=0: yes.\n\nSecond iteration.\n\nBut in the Fortran code:\n\nInitial k=10.\n\nCheck k <0: no.\n\nCheck cost > ans: no.\n\nAdd term.\n\nUpdate j=7, k=7.\n\nLoop again.\n\nCheck k <0: no.\n\nAdd term, update j=9, k=4.\n\nLoop again.\n\nCheck k <0: no.\n\nAdd term, update j=11, k=1.\n\nCheck loop: k=1 >=0.\n\nAdd term, update j=13, k=1-3= -2.\n\nLoop again.\n\nCheck k <0: yes. Exit.\n\nSo in Java, the loop would exit after k becomes -2, but the code would have added the term for k=1.\n\nSo the Fortran code correctly models this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nOnce the cost is computed for each i, ans is set to the minimum of ans and cost.\n\nFinally, after all i's, the ans is printed as ans + N*X.\n\nBut in Java, the code's initial ans is X*N +5*xsum[N], then during the loop, ans is updated with min(ans, cost). Then after the loop, the code outputs ans + N*X.\n\nBut that's X*N added again. For example, if initial ans is X*N +5*sum, then adding X*N again would give 2*X*N +5*sum. Which seems wrong. But perhaps the original code has a mistake. However, since we are to translate it as is, we must replicate it.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the loop, ans is printed as ans + N*X.\n\nSo the Fortran code will do:\n\nprint *, ans + N * X\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nFirst, declaring variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC027_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: N, X, ans, cost, i, j, k, temp_k\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: x(:), xsum(:)\n\ninteger :: sc\n\nread(*,*) N, X\n\nallocate(x(0:N-1))  ! assuming 0-based indexing\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n\n    read(*,*) x(i)\n\nend do\n\nallocate(xsum(0:N))\n\nxsum(0) =0_8\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n\n    xsum(i+1) =xsum(i) + x(i)\n\nend do\n\nans = X*N +5_8*xsum(N)\n\ndo i=1, N-1\n\n    cost = X*i +5_8*(xsum(N) -xsum(N-i))\n\n    j=5_8\n\n    k= N -i\n\n    do\n\n        if (k <0) exit\n\n        if (cost > ans) exit\n\n        temp_k = max(k -i, 0_8)\n\n        cost = cost + j*(xsum(k) -xsum(temp_k))\n\n        j = j +2_8\n\n        k = k -i\n\n    end do\n\n    if (cost < ans) then\n\n        ans = cost\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans + N*X\n\nend program atcoder_AGC027_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop over i runs from 1 to N-1, inclusive. So if N is 1, the loop doesn't execute, which matches Java's code.\n\nBut need to ensure that all variables are of kind=8, to handle large integers.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you write 5, it's default integer, which may be 4 bytes. So for variables declared as integer(kind=8), operations like 5*... may lose precision. So need to use 5_8.\n\nSo for example, in the code:\n\ncost = X*i +5_8*(xsum(N) -xsum(N-i))\n\nSimilarly, j starts at 5_8.\n\nAlso, when using max(k -i, 0), need to ensure 0 is of kind=8. So 0_8.\n\nSo in the line:\n\ntemp_k = max(k -i, 0_8)\n\nOtherwise, 0 is default integer, which could cause type mismatch.\n\nThus, all numeric literals in expressions involving kind=8 variables should be written with the _8 suffix.\n\nSo the code must be adjusted for that.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, array indices must be integers. So when k is calculated as N -i, which is kind=8, but Fortran allows this as long as the integer is within the range of default integers. However, if N and i are large (which they can be, since N is read as kind=8), then k may exceed the range of default integers. Therefore, the variables j, k, temp_k must be declared as kind=8.\n\nIn the code above, j, k, temp_k are declared as integer(kind=8), which is correct.\n\nAlso, the do loops over i use kind=8 variables. But Fortran allows loop variables to be integer(kind=8)? Wait, in Fortran, loop variables are of type integer, but if you use a kind=8 integer, you need to ensure that.\n\nIn Fortran 2003 and later, the loop variable can be of any integer type.\n\nSo, the outer loop:\n\ndo i=1, N-1\n\nBut i is declared as integer(kind=8), which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the code:\n\nans = X*N +5_8*xsum(N)\n\nBut xsum is 0:N, so xsum(N) is the sum up to x[N-1], which corresponds to Java's xsum[N].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTesting the code with sample input.\n\nFor example, let's take a sample input where N=1, X=2, x=3.\n\nJava code:\n\nxsum[1] =3.\n\nans =2*1 +5*3 = 2+15=17.\n\nThen, the loop runs for i from 1 to 0 (since N=1), so loop doesn't execute. Then output ans + N*X =17 +2*1=19. But according to the Java code, which is probably a bug. However, the original Java code is supposed to be translated as is.\n\nBut perhaps the correct output should be ans, not ans + N*X. But the original code includes that addition. So the Fortran code must do the same.\n\nThus, the code above correctly translates the Java code, including the possibly erroneous addition of N*X in the output.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, when you allocate an array with (0:N-1), the index starts at 0 and goes to N-1. So the code for reading x as x(0:N-1) is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as written, with all variables properly declared as kind=8, and with the correct array indices.\n\nI think that's all. Now, the code should be correctly translated."
