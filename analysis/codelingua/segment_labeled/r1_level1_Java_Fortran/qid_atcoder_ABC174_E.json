The program reads inputs, processes them, and outputs the result. \n\nFirst, looking at the main class and the Solution class. The solve method uses a binary search between min and max values to find the minimal maximum log length after cutting. The nei function checks if a certain mid value allows cutting the logs into k or fewer pieces.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Fortran has different input/output handling and lacks classes, so I'll need to structure this using subroutines and functions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe InputReader in Java is handling the input with BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. Fortran doesn't have these, so I'll need to read the input using standard Fortran methods. For reading the array, maybe read a line and parse integers.\n\nThe main steps in the Java code:\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read an array of n integers (logsLength).\n3. Perform binary search between min=1 and max=1e9+1000.\n4. For each mid, check if nei returns true (whether k cuts are sufficient to split all logs into pieces of size <= mid).\n5.
