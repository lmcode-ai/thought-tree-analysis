  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nSo, the code reads N and M. Then it initializes a list 'a' with N zeros. Then, for each of M switches, it reads k values, each representing a bulb connected to that switch. For each bulb, it sets a bit in the corresponding position in the 'a' list. Then it reads M values for p, which represents the desired state of each bulb. The main part is checking all possible combinations of switches (from 0 to 2^N -1) and counting how many combinations result in the desired p state.\n\nHmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I need to read N and M. Then, initialize an array a of size N with zeros. Then process M lines: each line has k followed by k numbers. For each of those numbers s (adjusted to 0-based), set the i-th bit in a(s).\n\nWait, the Java code uses a list of integers where each integer represents the bits for each bulb. For example, for each switch i (from 0 to M-1), when a bulb is connected to switch i, that bit is set in the a array. So a.get(s) has bits set for all switches that affect bulb s. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each of the M switches (i from 0 to M-1), when processing a switch, they read k bulbs. For each bulb s (converted to 0-based), they set the i-th bit of a[s]. So each entry in a is a bitmask indicating which switches affect that bulb. Then, when a combination of switches (s) is considered, each bulb's state is the XOR of the switches in s that affect it. The total t is the XOR of all the bits in a[i] where the i-th switch is in s. Then, t is compared to p, which is the desired state.\n\nSo the main challenge is handling the bitwise operations and the loops correctly in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are static unless declared otherwise. So, let's start.\n\nFirst, read N and M. Then, create an array a of size N, initialized to 0. Then, for each of the M switches (from 0 to M-1?), read k, then read k s values. For each s (after decrementing by 1), set the i-th bit in a(s) to 1. Wait, but in Java, the code is a.set(s, a.get(s) | (1 << i)), where i is the current switch index (from 0 to M-1). So each bulb s's bitmask is ORed with 1 shifted left by the switch index i. So each bulb's a entry has bits set for each switch that affects it.\n\nIn Fortran, integers can be 32 or 64 bits. So perhaps using integer(kind=8) to handle larger bitmasks. But M can be up to 10, perhaps, but in the problem constraints (from the original problem, which is likely ABC128 C), N and M can be up to 10 and 1e5? Wait, but the code loops up to 2^N, which for N=10 is manageable (1024 iterations). So M could be up to 10, perhaps. Let's proceed.\n\nSo for the a array, each element is a bitmask. Then, for the switches, the code reads M lines. So for each i in 0 to M-1, read k and then k s's. For each s, set a(s) = a(s) OR (1 shifted left by i).\n\nIn Fortran, bitwise operations are available with functions like IOR, ISHFT. So, for example, a(s) = IOR(a(s), ISHFT(1, i)).\n\nThen, after reading all the switches, read M integers into p. Each x is 0 or 1. Then p is formed by x << i for each bit i. So the p variable is the bitwise OR of all x_i shifted by their position. For example, for M=3, if x0 is 1, x1 is 0, x2 is 1, then p would be 1 | (0 <<1) | (1 <<2) = 5.\n\nWait, in Java code, for each i in 0..M-1, x is read, and p |= (x << i). So the i-th bit of p is x. So p is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to the desired state of that bulb.\n\nThen, the code iterates all possible s from 0 to 2^N -1. For each s, t is computed by XORing a.get(i) for each i where the i-th bit is set in s. Then, if t equals p, increment the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to loop s from 0 to 2^N -1. Then, for each bit in s, check if it's set. If so, XOR t with a(i+1), since Fortran arrays are 1-based.\n\nWait, the a array in Java is 0-based. So in Fortran, when s is a bitmask, each bit i (0-based) in s corresponds to the switch i+1 in Fortran. Wait, no. Let me see: in Java, for each i from 0 to N-1, if the i-th bit of s is set, then t ^= a.get(i). So in Fortran, since a is 1-based, we need to check the (i-1)th bit. Or adjust the indices.\n\nWait, in Java, the a list has N elements, 0-based. In Fortran, the array a would be dimension N, 1-based. So for each s in 0..2^N -1, for each i in 0..N-1, check if the i-th bit is set. If yes, then get a(i+1) in Fortran and XOR t with that.\n\nSo, for example, in Java, i is 0-based. So for s, the bits correspond to 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, to loop over bits 0 to N-1, we need to check if that bit is set in s, and if so, XOR t with a(i+1), since the a array is 1-based.\n\nSo, for each s in 0 to 2^N -1:\n\nt = 0\n\ndo i = 0 to N-1\n\n   if (btest(s, i)) then\n\n      t = ieor(t, a(i+1))\n\n   endif\n\nend do\n\nThen compare t with p. If equal, increment ans.\n\nNow, how to loop s from 0 to (1<<N) -1.\n\nIn Fortran, 1 << N is 2**N, so the loop is do s = 0, 2**N -1.\n\nBut wait, when N is 10, 2**10 is 1024, which is manageable.\n\nBut in Fortran, the exponent operator is **. So 2**N.\n\nBut in Fortran, integers can have up to certain bits. Let's assume that N is up to 15, so 2^15 is 32768, which is manageable.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize a(1..N) to 0.\n\nLoop for i from 1 to M:\n\n   read k, then read k s values (each is 1-based in input?), then subtract 1 to make 0-based.\n\n   For each s in those k values (after subtracting 1), set a(s+1) = a(s+1) OR (1 shifted left by (i-1)), since the i-th loop corresponds to switch index i-1 (since the Java loop is for i from 0 to M-1). Wait, in Java, for each switch in 0..M-1, and each s in that switch's bulbs, a.set(s, ... | (1 << i). So in the Fortran code, the first loop (i=0 in Java) corresponds to the first M element. So in Fortran, the loop for M times, and for each iteration, we need to shift by (current loop index -1) ?\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n   read k\n\n   for each bulb in this switch (i-th switch):\n\n      a.set(s, ... | (1 << i)\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loops are from 1 to M. So for each m in 1..M:\n\n   read k\n\n   read k s values (which are 1-based in input?), then subtract 1 to get 0-based.\n\n   For each s in those k:\n\n      a(s+1) = a(s+1) OR (ISHFT(1, m-1))\n\nBecause m starts at 1, so m-1 is 0 for the first switch, which matches the Java code's i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, after processing all switches, read M x's. For each x (0 or 1), set p's bits. The code in Java is:\n\np = 0\n\nfor i in 0..M-1:\n\n   x = sc.nextInt()\n\n   p |= (x << i)\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is for m in 1..M:\n\n   read x\n\n   p = IOR(p, ISHFT(x, m-1))\n\nBut x can be 0 or 1. So shifting x by (m-1) bits.\n\nNow, after that, loop s from 0 to 2**N -1, compute t as XOR of a(i+1) where bit i of s is set.\n\nCompare t to p. If equal, increment ans.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nIn Fortran, variable declarations are needed. Let's think about data types.\n\nFor a, since each element can have up to M bits, and M can be up to say 10, then using default integers (32-bit) should suffice. So integer, dimension(N) :: a.\n\nSimilarly, p and t can be integer.\n\nSo the code outline in Fortran would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, M, i, j, k, s_val, x, p, t, ans, m\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nread(*,*) N, M\n\nallocate(a(N))\n\na = 0\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read(*,*) k\n\n    do j = 1, k\n\n        read(*,*) s_val\n\n        s_val = s_val - 1  ! convert to 0-based index\n\n        a(s_val + 1) = ior(a(s_val + 1), ishft(1, i-1))  ! i is the current loop (1-based), so shift by i-1\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\np = 0\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    p = ior(p, ishft(x, i-1))\n\nend do\n\nans = 0\n\ndo s = 0, 2**N - 1\n\n    t = 0\n\n    do i = 0, N-1\n\n        if (btest(s, i)) then\n\n            t = ieor(t, a(i+1))\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (t == p) then\n\n        ans = ans + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, 2**N may not be correctly computed if N is large, but since N is up to 10 or 15, it's okay. Also, in the loop for s, 0 to 2**N -1, but in Fortran, integers are signed, so if N is 15, 2^15 is 32768, but 32767 is the maximum. But since the loop is from 0 to 2^N -1, it's okay.\n\nWait, for N=10, 2**10=1024, so 0 to 1023.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The a array is initialized to 0, correct.\n\n- When reading s_val in the switches, the input s is 1-based, converted to 0-based (s_val = ... -1), then a(s_val +1) is the correct 1-based index.\n\n- For each switch i (1-based in Fortran), the shift is by i-1 bits.\n\n- When building p, each x is read, and shifted by i-1 (since i ranges 1..M, and p's bits are 0..M-1).\n\n- Then, for each s in 0..2^N -1, loop i from 0 to N-1 (since s is an N-bit number). For each i, check if bit i is set. If yes, XOR t with a(i+1).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, the exponentiation operator is **, and 2**N is computed as an integer. But if N is up to 15, 2^15 is 32768, which is within the 32-bit integer limit.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable s has to be an integer, which is allowed.\n\nNow, possible test case.\n\nFor example, N=2, M=2.\n\nSwitches:\n\nSwitch 1 (i=1 in Fortran, shift 0):\n\nk=2, bulbs 1 and 2 (s_val after subtract 1 is 0 and 1). So a(1) |= 1<<0 (1), a(2) |= 1<<0 (1).\n\nSwitch 2 (i=2, shift 1):\n\nk=1, bulb 2 (s_val 1 after subtract 1). So a(2) |= 1<<1 (2). So a(2) is 1+2=3.\n\nThen p is read as two x's. Suppose x1=0, x2=1. So p is (0 <<0) | (1 <<1) = 2.\n\nNow, loop s from 0 to 3 (binary 00, 01, 10, 11).\n\nFor each s:\n\nt is XOR of a[i] where bit i is set in s.\n\nFor s=0 (binary 00), no bits set. t=0. Compare to p=2: no.\n\ns=1 (01): bits 0. So t = a(1) = 1. Not equal to 2.\n\ns=2 (10): bit 1. t = a(2) =3. Not equal to 2.\n\ns=3 (11): bits 0 and 1. t = 1 XOR 3 = 2. Which matches p. So ans=1.\n\nSo the output would be 1.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: Fortran's bitwise functions. For example, BTEST(s, i) returns true if the i-th bit (0-based) is set. So for i from 0 to N-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this code should work. Now, code:\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when using ISHFT(1, i-1), if i-1 is large (like 30), it can cause overflow. But given the problem constraints, M is probably up to 10 or 15, which is manageable.\n\nAnother point: the switches are processed in the order M times. So each switch i (1 to M) contributes to the a array with bits corresponding to i-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential corner cases: N=0 (but the problem probably states N>=1). But according to the original code, N is read as an integer, so the code should handle any N>=0. But in Fortran, when N=0, 2**0 is 1, but the loop would be s from 0 to 0. But if N is 0, the a array is size 0, which would be a problem. So the problem must have N>=1.\n\nBut in the problem statement of ABC128 C, the constraints are 1<=N<=10, 1<=M<=10. So no issues.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as above."
