Then it creates an array dp of size 200001. Then, for n iterations, it reads integers and stores their indices in the dp array. So, for example, if the input numbers are like 3,1,2, then dp[3] =0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2. Then it calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive numbers from 2 to n, using their positions stored in dp. So for i from 2 to n, ans += abs(dp[i] - dp[i-1]).\n\nNow, how to do this in Fortran?\n\nFirst, Fortran uses static arrays, but here the Java code uses a size of 200001. So in Fortran, we can declare the dp array with that size. Also, Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but Java's are 0-based. Wait, the Java code uses indexes starting from 1? Because the input numbers are read as s.nextInt(), and stored in dp at that index. For example, if the input is 3, then dp[3] is set to i (which is 0-based, since i runs from 0 to n-1). So in Fortran, if we use 1-based arrays, maybe we need to shift the indices. Wait, no. Let's think.\n\nIn Java, the dp array is 200001 elements, indexes from 0 to 200000. Then, when they read a value, say x, they set dp[x] = i (where i is 0 to n-1). So the indices in dp are the actual values from the input, and the stored value is their position (0-based) in the input sequence.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can start at 1. So, we need to declare dp as (200001), which in Fortran would be 1-based by default. Wait, if the Java code uses x as the index, which could be up to 200000 (since the array is size 200001, indices 0-200000). Wait, no: new int[200001] creates an array of 200001 elements, indexes 0 to 200000. So in Java, the maximum x that can be stored without index out of bounds is 200000.\n\nIn Fortran, if we declare dp(200001), that's 1-based, indexes 1 to 200001. So, if the input x can be up to 200000, then in Fortran, we need to make sure that dp can handle x up to 200000, which would require the array to be from 1 to 200000? Or maybe 0 to 200000. Wait, but Fortran's array indices can be set. So perhaps we can declare dp as (0:200000), so that the indices start at 0, matching Java's code.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. So in Fortran, the dp array can be dimensioned from 0 to 200000. That way, when we read x, we store dp(x) = i (but in Fortran, i would start at 0 or 1? Let's check.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++). So i runs from 0 to n-1, and for each input x, dp[x] = i. So the positions are 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, when reading the inputs, we need to loop from 1 to n, but since the positions are 0-based in Java, perhaps in Fortran, the loop index will be from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, Fortran's do loops are more straightforward with starting at 1. Alternatively, adjust the indices.\n\nWait, the problem is that in Java, the first input is stored as dp[x] = 0, the second as 1, etc. So in Fortran, if I loop from 1 to n, and set dp(x) = i-1, then i-1 would be 0-based.\n\nSo, for example, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n  read x\n  dp(x) = i-1\nend do\n\nYes, that way, the first element is 0, matching Java.\n\nThen, for the sum part, the Java code loops from i=2 to n, adding abs(dp[i] - dp[i-1]).\n\nIn Fortran, since the array starts at 0, but in the code, i ranges from 2 to n. So in Fortran, for i from 2 to n, compute the difference between dp(i) and dp(i-1), take absolute value, sum all.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Declare an array dp(0:200000), initialized to some default? Well, in Java, the array is initially all zeros, but since the input numbers are overwriting certain indices, the rest are zero. But in the code, the input numbers are from 1 to n, perhaps? Because the code then loops from 2 to n. So perhaps the inputs are a permutation of 1..n. Because the code assumes that for all i in 1..n, dp[i] is set. Because in the Java code, after reading n numbers, which are stored in dp[x], and then the loop from 2 to n uses those indices. So if the input numbers are not exactly 1..n, then the code would have issues, but according to the problem's context, perhaps the input is a permutation of 1..n. So in Fortran, assuming that the input numbers are 1..n.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, x\n  integer, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n  integer(kind=8) :: ans  ! Since Java's long is 64-bit, use 8-byte integer\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  dp = 0  ! Initialize all elements to 0 (though not necessary if all x are 1..n)\n\n  do i = 0, n-1\n    read(*,*) x\n    dp(x) = i\n  end do\n\n  ans = 0\n  do i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + abs(dp(i) - dp(i-1))\n  end do\n\n  print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop for reading the n elements: in Java, the loop runs for i=0 to n-1. So in Fortran, perhaps the loop is from 1 to n? Wait, because in Java, for (int i=0; i <n; i++) \u2192 n iterations. So in Fortran, do i = 1, n would have n iterations. But then, when we read x, and assign dp(x) = i-1 (since in Java i is 0 to n-1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n  read x\n  dp(x) = i-1  ! because Java's i starts at 0\nend do\n\nYes, that would correctly set dp(x) to 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThen, the sum loop: i runs from 2 to n, and adds abs(dp[i] - dp[i-1]).\n\nIn Fortran, the indices for the dp array are from 0 to 200000. So for i=2, it's dp(2) - dp(1), etc.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array is 0-based here. So yes.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when you declare dp(0:200000), then dp(0) is the first element, dp(1) the next, etc.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the size? The Java code's dp is 200001 elements (indices 0-200000). The Fortran code's dp(0:200000) has 200001 elements, same as Java.\n\nNow, data types: in Java, the dp array is int[], which is 32-bit integers. In Fortran, the default integer is typically 4 bytes, same as Java's int. So that's okay.\n\nBut for the 'ans' variable: in Java, it's a long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, we should declare ans as integer(kind=8), to ensure it can hold large sums. For example, if n is 2e5, each term could be up to 2e5, sum is 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10, which fits in a 32-bit integer (max 2^31-1 is about 2e9), so no. So 4e10 is bigger than 2e9, so ans must be 64-bit.\n\nSo in Fortran, declare ans as integer(8) or integer(kind=8).\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, x\n  integer, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n  integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) x\n    dp(x) = i - 1\n  end do\n\n  ans = 0\n  do i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + abs(dp(i) - dp(i - 1))\n  end do\n\n  print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but when declaring dp, should we initialize it? In Java, the array is initialized to all zeros. But in Fortran, the array's initial values are undefined unless explicitly initialized. So when the code loops through the input, it's setting the x indices to i-1, but any other indices (not in the input) would have undefined values. But according to the problem's logic, the inputs are a permutation of 1..n. So x is from 1 to n. So all the other entries in dp (like 0, n+1, etc.) are irrelevant. Because in the sum loop, i runs from 2 to n, and those dp entries (i and i-1) are all initialized via the input. So the rest of the array doesn't matter. So initializing the dp array isn't necessary here.\n\nSo the code should work as written.\n\nTesting with the sample input. Let's say n=3, and the input is 1, 2, 3. Then dp(1)=0, dp(2)=1, dp(3)=2. The sum is |1-0| + |2-1| = 1 +1 = 2. So output is 2.\n\nIn code:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni=2: dp(2) - dp(1) \u2192 1-0 =1 \u2192 ans becomes 1.\n\ni=3: 2-1=1 \u2192 ans becomes 2.\n\nYes. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: input n=2, numbers 2 and 1. Then dp(2)=0, dp(1)=1. Sum is |1-0|=1. So output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work."
