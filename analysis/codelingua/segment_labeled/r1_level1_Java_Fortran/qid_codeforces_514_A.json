  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, it reads a long integer from the input. Then, it processes each digit, starting from the right (since it's using modulo 10). For each digit, if 9 minus the digit is smaller than the digit itself, it replaces the digit with 9 - digit. But there's a special case: if it's the first digit (after all divisions by 10, when x/10 is 0) and 9 - digit is zero, then it keeps the original digit. Otherwise, it uses 9 - digit. Then, it builds the new number by reversing the digits collected (since they were added in reverse order during the loop).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read a number.\n2. Split into digits, process each to possibly invert (9 - digit) based on conditions.\n3. Reassemble the digits into a new number.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran. Let's think about how to handle each part.\n\nFirst, reading the input. Java uses Scanner to read a long. Fortran can read an integer with a large enough kind. But Fortran's default integers might not handle very large numbers. So maybe use a character string to read the number as a string, process each character as a digit. That might be easier, especially since handling very large numbers in Fortran's integer types could be problematic. But looking at the original code, the input is a long in Java, which is 64 bits. So in Fortran, using integer(kind=8) might work. But if the number is very long, perhaps using a string approach is better. Let me check the original code's logic again.\n\nWait, the original code processes the number digit by digit, regardless of its size. For example, if the input is a 18-digit number, the Java code would handle it as a long. Wait, no, Java's long is 64-bit, so the maximum is 9e18. So if the input is larger than that, the code would fail. But the original code uses nextLong(), so the user is expected to input a valid long. So in Fortran, using an integer(kind=8) should suffice. But perhaps in Fortran, reading a very large integer as a string and processing each character is safer. However, let's proceed under the assumption that the input is within the range of a 64-bit integer.\n\nSo, steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input as a 64-bit integer (maybe using read with integer(8)).\n\nBut processing digits: in Java, the code takes x mod 10 to get the last digit, then x = x /10. So in Fortran, the same can be done. Let's collect the digits into an array (like the list in Java), then reverse them when building the new number.\n\nWait, in Java, the digits are added in reverse order. For example, if x is 123, then the list would get 3 first, then 2, then 1. Then, when building the new number, they multiply by 10^pow, starting from pow=0, so 3 * 10^0 + 2 *10^1 +1*10^2 = 3 +20 +100 = 123. But in the code, after processing, each digit is possibly replaced. Wait, but the code is building the reversed digits into the new number. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nnewNumber starts as 0. For each element in the list (in the order they were added), it multiplies by 10^pow where pow starts at 0 and increments each time. So the first digit in the list (which was the last digit of the original x) is multiplied by 10^0, the next by 10^1, etc. So the list [3,2,1] would create 3*1 +2*10 +1*100= 123. But the original x was 123. Wait, but the list is built in the order of the digits of x, starting from the least significant digit (x%10). So the list is the digits in reverse order. Then, when building newNumber, the first element is the least significant digit. So the code effectively reverses the digits again. Wait, no. Let's take x=123.\n\nDigits collected would be:\n\nx=123: r=3, process, add to list. x becomes 12.\n\nx=12: r=2, process, add to list. x becomes 1.\n\nx=1: r=1, process, add to list. x becomes 0.\n\nList is [3,2,1]. Then, in the loop:\n\ni=0: list.get(0)=3, 10^0=1. newNumber +=3*1=3.\n\ni=1: list.get(1)=2, 10^1=10. +=20 \u2192 23.\n\ni=2: list.get(2)=1, 10^2=100 \u2192 +100 \u2192 123.\n\nSo the newNumber is 123. But that's the same as the original. So the code's processing must be modifying the digits. Let me see when digits are changed. For example, if a digit is 8, 9-8=1 <8, so it's replaced with 1. So the code creates the minimum possible number by inverting digits where 9-d is smaller than d, except for the first digit (when x/10 is 0) and 9-d is 0.\n\nWait, the condition is: if (9 - r < r). Then, if that's the case, then check if it's the first digit (after x/10 is zero) and 9-r is zero. For example, if the digit is 9, 9-9=0. So if it's the first digit (like the first digit in the original number, which would be the last digit processed), then 9-r is zero. So in that case, don't replace. Otherwise, replace.\n\nSo for example, the input 999 would be processed as:\n\nEach digit is 9. 9-9=0 <9? No. So 0 is not less than 9. Wait, wait, 9 - r is 0, which is less than r (9). So the condition is true. Then, check if x/10 ==0 (meaning this is the last digit to process, which in the original number is the first digit). And 9-r is 0. So for the first digit (when processing), which is the most significant digit of the original number, when x/10 becomes 0, if 9-r is 0, then we add r instead. So in the case of 999, the digits processed are 9,9,9.\n\nProcessing first (the original last digit) 9: x=999, r=9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 true. Check if x/10 (999/10=99) is not 0. So add 0 to the list. Then x=99.\n\nNext, x=99, r=9. 9-9=0 <9. x/10 is 9, not zero. So add 0. x=9.\n\nNext, x=9, r=9. x/10 is 0. 9-9=0. So add r (9). Then the list is [0,0,9]. Then when building newNumber, it's 0*1 +0*10 +9*100 = 900. Which is the correct inversion (999 becomes 900+0+0=900).\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, back to translating this into Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the number as an integer(8). Then, process each digit similarly.\n\nBut how to collect the digits? In Java, they use an ArrayList of Long. In Fortran, we can use an array, but since the size is dynamic (depends on the number of digits), perhaps we can use an allocatable array, or determine the maximum possible digits (like 18 digits for 64-bit) and use a static array.\n\nAlternatively, process the digits and reverse them as needed.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input as integer(8):\n\nprogram codeforces_514_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: x, newNumber, r, temp\n    integer :: pow, i\n    integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n    integer :: list_size\n\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    ! Handle x=0? Because the original code's loop runs while x>0. So if x is 0, the loop doesn't run. But in that case, the code would output 0. But if x is zero, the original code would loop once? Wait no: x=0, the loop condition is x>0, so the loop doesn't run. So list remains empty, and newNumber is 0. So the code would print 0. But what about x=0? The code would output 0. Which is correct, since the problem says to invert digits, but for 0, there are no digits to invert.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nInitialize an allocatable array to collect the digits.\n\nWe can start with a size of zero, and append elements as needed. But Fortran's allocatable arrays can be extended using move_alloc.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the maximum possible digits. For 64-bit integer, the maximum is 1e18, which has 19 digits. So create an array of size 20, then track the count.\n\nLet me do this:\n\n    integer :: digits(0:19)  ! indexes 0 to 19 (20 digits)\n    integer :: count\n\n    count = 0\n    temp = x\n    do while (temp > 0)\n        r = mod(temp, 10_8)\n        ! process r\n        if (9 - r < r) then\n            if (temp / 10 == 0 .and. (9 - r) == 0) then\n                list(count) = r\n            else\n                list(count) = 9 - r\n            end if\n        else\n            list(count) = r\n        end if\n        count = count + 1\n        temp = temp / 10\n    end do\n\nWait, but in the original code, the digits are added in reverse order (from least significant to most). Then, when building the new number, they are used in the same order, multiplied by 10^pow, starting from pow=0. So the first digit in the list (least significant) is the first to multiply by 10^0, etc. Which effectively reverses the digits again. But that's how the code works. So in Fortran, after processing the digits into the list, the order is the same as the Java code's list.\n\nBut in Fortran, the way to collect the digits would be similar. Let's see:\n\nFor example, x=123:\n\ntemp=123 \u2192 r=3, add to list, count=1, temp=12.\n\ntemp=12 \u2192 r=2, add to list, count=2, temp=1.\n\ntemp=1 \u2192 r=1, add to list, count=3, temp=0.\n\nSo list is [3,2,1], same as Java.\n\nThen, when building newNumber:\n\npow starts at 0, newNumber is sum of list(i) * 10^pow, for i=0 to count-1.\n\nSo 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 = 123.\n\nBut in Java, the list is [3,2,1], and in the loop, i runs from 0 to list.size()-1. So same here.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would loop from 1 to count (assuming the list is stored in indexes 1 to count, but in the code above I used 0-based). Wait, no, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps better to make the list start from index 1.\n\nWait, let's adjust.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a dynamic array, but in Fortran, that's a bit tricky. So perhaps:\n\nWe can create an array with initial size 20 (max digits). Let's use a variable 'count' to track how many digits are added.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: digits(20)\ninteger :: count\ncount = 0\ntemp = x\n\ndo while (temp > 0)\n    r = mod(temp, 10_8)\n    ! process r\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n        if (temp / 10 == 0 .and. (9 - r) == 0) then\n            digits(count +1) = r\n        else\n            digits(count +1) = 9 - r\n        end if\n    else\n        digits(count +1) = r\n    end if\n    count = count +1\n    temp = temp / 10\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division with / truncates towards zero. For positive numbers, same as Java's division. So temp = temp /10 would work.\n\nSo now, digits(1) is the first digit processed (the least significant digit of x), digits(2) next, etc.\n\nThen, when building newNumber, we need to multiply each digit by 10^pow, where pow starts at 0 and increases.\n\nSo newNumber is initialized to 0.\n\npow =0\n\ndo i=1, count\n    newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * (10_8 ** pow)\n    pow = pow +1\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, 10**pow is computed as an integer. But for pow up to 18 (digits up to 19), 10^18 is 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer range (since 2^63 is about 9e18). So using 10_8**pow is possible, but 10**18 is 1e18, which is 1 followed by 18 zeros, which is 1000000000000000000, which is 10^18.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, some edge cases:\n\nIf x is 0, the loop doesn't execute, count remains 0, newNumber is 0. Correct.\n\nIf x is 9, then during processing:\n\ntemp=9, r=9.\n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 true.\n\nCheck if temp/10 ==0 (yes, since 9/10=0 in integer division). And 9-r=0. So add r (9) to the list.\n\nThen, newNumber is 9*10^0 =9. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=1234.\n\nDigits are 4,3,2,1.\n\nProcessing each:\n\n4: 9-4=5>4 \u2192 no, so stays 4.\n\n3:9-3=6>3 \u2192 no, stays 3.\n\n2:9-2=7>2 \u2192 no, stays 2.\n\n1:9-1=8>1 \u2192 no, stays 1.\n\nSo newNumber is 4*1 +3*10 +2*100 +1*1000 = 4+30+200+1000= 1234. So no change.\n\nAnother example: x= 8888.\n\nProcessing each digit 8.\n\nFor each, 9-8=1 <8 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if temp/10 ==0. For the first digit (the original leftmost digit, which is 8, and when temp is 8, divided by 10 is 0). So 9-r is 1. So in this case, for the leftmost digit (which is being processed last in the loop), when temp/10 is 0, and 9-r is 1 (not zero), so we add 1. The other digits (processed when temp/10 is non-zero) are replaced with 1.\n\nSo digits collected are:\n\nProcessing 8 (rightmost, temp is 8888 \u2192 temp/10=888, so not zero. So replace 8 with 1. digits(1) =1.\n\nThen temp=888, r=8 \u2192 replace with 1. digits(2)=1.\n\ntemp=88 \u2192 r=8 \u2192 replace with 1. digits(3)=1.\n\ntemp=8 \u2192 r=8. temp/10 is 0. 9-8=1. So replace with 1. digits(4)=1.\n\nSo newNumber is 1*1 +1*10 +1*100 +1*1000 \u2192 1111. Correct.\n\nSo code should work.\n\nNow, putting this into Fortran code.\n\nBut there's an issue: in the original Java code, the list is built in reverse order (the digits are added as x is divided by 10). So the digits are in reverse order of the original number. Then, when building newNumber, each digit is multiplied by 10^pow, which increases each time, which effectively reverses the order again. So the digits are processed in the correct order.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the digits are stored in the same order as in Java. So the code should work.\n\nNow, code.\n\nFirst, read x as integer(8).\n\nThen, process each digit.\n\nBut need to handle x=0. Wait, the original code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nprogram codeforces_514_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: x, newNumber, r, temp\n    integer :: pow, i, count\n    integer :: digits(20)  ! maximum 19 digits for 64-bit integer\n    integer :: j\n\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    count = 0\n    temp = x\n\n    do while (temp > 0)\n        r = mod(temp, 10_8)\n        if (9 - r < r) then\n            if (temp / 10 == 0 .and. (9 - r) == 0) then\n                ! add r\n                count = count + 1\n                digits(count) = r\n            else\n                count = count + 1\n                digits(count) = 9 - r\n            end if\n        else\n            count = count + 1\n            digits(count) = r\n        end if\n        temp = temp / 10\n    end do\n\n    newNumber = 0_8\n    pow = 0\n\n    do i = 1, count\n        newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * (10_8 ** pow)\n        pow = pow + 1\n    end do\n\n    print *, newNumber\n\nend program codeforces_514_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the exponentiation operator for integers is **. However, in Fortran, when you do 10_8 ** pow, pow must be an integer. Since pow starts at 0 and increments up to count-1 (which could be up to 18), 10_8**pow is okay.\n\nBut 10_8**pow is computed as an integer. For pow=18, 10^18 is 1000000000000000000, which is 1e18. The maximum value of a 64-bit signed integer is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (about 9e18), so 1e18 is within that range.\n\nBut in the loop where we compute newNumber, we have digits(i) * 10**pow. For digits up to 9 and pow up to 18, the maximum term is 9*1e18 = 9e18, which is just under the 64-bit integer limit. So sum of these terms can be up to 9e18 * 20 (digits) which is 1.8e20, which is way beyond 64-bit integer's capacity. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, this is a mistake. Because if the input is a 64-bit integer, then the maximum value is 9e18, so the reversed digits (when multiplied) may exceed 64-bit integer's capacity. For example, if the digits processed form a number larger than 9e18, then newNumber will overflow, leading to incorrect results.\n\nBut the original Java code uses long (64-bit) for newNumber, so same problem. But Java's long can handle up to 9e18. So in Fortran, using integer(8) for newNumber is correct. But during calculation, multiplying digits(i) by 10^pow could exceed the 64-bit limit. For example, 9 * 10^18 is 9e18, which is within 64-bit. But if the number has 19 digits, then 10^18 is the maximum exponent. So for 19 digits, the first digit (digits(1)) is multiplied by 10^0, and the last (digits(19) by 10^18. So each term is up to 9*10^18. Summing these can lead to numbers up to 999...999 (19 9's), which is 1e19-1, which is 10^19-1. That is 10000000000000000000-1=9999999999999999999. Which is 1e19-1. However, a 64-bit signed integer can only hold up to 9223372036854775807 (about 9e18). So numbers with 19 digits would overflow.\n\nSo the original Java code can't handle numbers larger than 9e18 (since it's read as a long). So the code is correct for inputs up to 9e18. But in Fortran, using integer(8) for x and newNumber is the same. So the code would have the same limitations. However, if the input is a number with more than 18 digits, the code would not read it properly. But the original code also can't handle such inputs.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correct as per the original code's logic.\n\nAnother possible issue: the initial code uses (long) Math.pow(10, pow). But Math.pow returns a double, which when cast to long could lose precision for large exponents. For example, Math.pow(10, 18) is 1e18, which is exactly representable as a double, but for higher exponents like 19, 1e19 is also representable. But perhaps in Java, for pow up to 22, the cast works. But the original code is correct as per the problem.\n\nSo the Fortran code uses 10_8**pow, which is exact.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nTest case 1: x=999. Processed digits:\n\ntemp=999: r=9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. temp/10=99 \u22600. So add 0. count=1. temp=99.\n\ntemp=99: r=9. 9-9=0. temp/10=9 \u22600. add 0. count=2. temp=9.\n\ntemp=9: r=9. temp/10=0. 9-9=0. So add r (9). count=3.\n\ndigits = [0,0,9].\n\nnewNumber = 0*1 +0*10 +9*100 = 900. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: x= 123456789 \u2192 processed digits:\n\nEach digit is r=9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nr=9 \u2192 0 <9. temp/10=12345678 \u22600. So add 0. \u2192 0.\n\nr=8 \u2192 1 <8 \u2192 add 1.\n\nr=7 \u2192 2 <7 \u2192 add 2.\n\nr=6 \u21923 <6 \u2192 add 3.\n\nr=5 \u21924 <5 \u2192 add4.\n\nr=4 \u21925>4 \u2192 add4.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait for each digit:\n\nOriginal x=123456789. Processing digits from right to left:9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nProcessing each:\n\n9 \u2192 9-r is 0 <9. temp/10=12345678 (\u22600). So add 0.\n\n8 \u2192 1 <8 \u2192 add 1.\n\n7 \u2192 2 <7 \u2192 add 2.\n\n6 \u21923 <6 \u2192 add3.\n\n5 \u21924 <5 \u2192 add4.\n\n4 \u21925>4 \u2192 keep4.\n\n3 \u21926>3 \u2192 keep3.\n\n2 \u21927>2 \u2192 keep2.\n\n1 \u21928>1 \u2192 keep1.\n\nSo digits are [0,1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1].\n\nThen newNumber is 0*1 +1*10 +2*100 +3*1000 +4*10^4 +4*10^5 +3*10^6 +2*10^7 +1*10^8 \u2192 0 +10 +200 +3000 +40000 +400000 +3,000,000 +20,000,000 +100,000,000 \u2192 sum these:\n\n100,000,000\n\n+20,000,000 \u2192 120,000,000\n\n+3,000,000 \u2192 123,000,000\n\n+400,000 \u2192 123,400,000\n\n+40,000 \u2192 123,440,000\n\n+3,000 \u2192 123,443,000\n\n+200 \u2192 123,443,200\n\n+10 \u2192 123,443,210.\n\nBut the original number is 123456789 \u2192 the minimum number after processing is 123443210? Hmm. Let me see. The original code's logic is to replace each digit with 9-digit if it's smaller. So for digits 9,8,7,6,5,4:\n\nDigit 9 becomes 0 (since 0 is smaller than 9).\n\nDigit 8 becomes 1.\n\n7 becomes 2.\n\n6 becomes 3.\n\n5 becomes4.\n\n4 remains4 because 5>4.\n\n3 becomes6-3=6>3? Wait no: 9-3=6, which is larger than 3. So no replacement. So 3 remains 3.\n\nSimilarly for 2 and 1.\n\nSo the processed digits are 0,1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1. So the new number is 123443210. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should generate this.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would correctly compute this.\n\nAnother test case: x= 5 \u2192 processed as 5. 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 yes. temp/10 is 0 \u2192 check if 4 is zero? No. So replace 5 with 4. newNumber=4.\n\nSo the code would output 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code reads x as integer(8), processes each digit, builds the digits array, then computes newNumber.\n\nNow, handle x=0. The loop does not run, count remains 0. newNumber is initialized to 0. So it prints 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written."
