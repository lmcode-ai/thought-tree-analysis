  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. So, the program reads two integers, n and d, then an array of n integers. Then, for each element from the second one onwards, it checks if the previous element is greater than or equal to the current. If so, it calculates how many times d needs to be added to the current element to make it larger than the previous. The result is the sum of these increments.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's start with the structure. In Java, the main method is where everything happens. In Fortran, the main program starts with a program block.\n\nFirst, variable declarations. Java uses int for integers, which in Fortran is integer. The array nums is declared as an integer array of size n. So in Fortran, I'll need to allocate that dynamically since n is read from input. Also, variables like result and a are integers.\n\nJava's Scanner is used for input. In Fortran, we use read(*,*) to read from standard input. So, read the first two values into n and d. Then read the array elements.\n\nThe loop in Java starts at index 1 (since i is from 1 to n-1), checking the previous element. The Fortran array indices start at 1 by default, so perhaps adjust the loops. Wait, in Java, nums is zero-based. So the original code compares nums[i-1] (which is the first element when i=1) to nums[i]. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the loop would start at i=2 up to n. Because for i=2, the previous element is i-1=1.\n\nWait, in the original code, the loop runs from i=1 to i < n (so i=1,2,...,n-1). For each i, it compares nums[i-1] and nums[i]. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the loop would be i from 2 to n. So i starts at 2, and the previous element is i-1 (which is 1, then 2, etc.), current is i.\n\nSo, the array in Fortran should be 1-based. So when reading the input, read n elements into nums(1), nums(2), ..., nums(n).\n\nThen, loop from i=2 to n. Compute a = nums(i-1) - nums(i). If a >=0, then compute how many times to add d to nums(i) so that it's bigger than nums(i-1).\n\nThe calculation in Java is (a / d + 1). For example, if a is 5 and d is 2, then 5/2=2, so 2+1=3 steps. Adding 3*2=6 to the current element makes it nums[i] = 6, and previous is 5. Wait, original code: nums[i-1] is the previous element. Wait, if nums[i-1] is larger than nums[i], then a is positive. So the code does:\n\nresult += a/d +1. Then nums[i] is increased by (a/d +1)*d. For example, if nums[i-1] is 5 and nums[i] is 3, d is 2. Then a=2. 2/2=1, +1=2. So add 2*2=4 to nums[i], making it 7. Now nums[i] is 7, which is 2 more than nums[i-1] (5). Wait, but why? Because the code adds (a/d +1)*d. So even if a is exactly divisible by d, it adds one more step. Like, if a=2 and d=2, a/d is 1, adding 1 step (since +1) makes it 2 steps, adding 2*2=4, making nums[i] =3+4=7. Wait, but why? Because the code wants nums[i] to be larger than nums[i-1]. So original code's logic is: compute how much difference a. If a is >=0, then current element is <= previous. So we need to add enough multiples of d to make current > previous.\n\nSo the number of steps is (a // d) +1. Because (a/d) gives how many times d fits into a, but adding 1 more step to make it exceed. For example, a=5, d=2. a//d is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Then add 1 step to get 3 steps, which is 6 added. So the new nums[i] is original nums[i] +3*2= nums[i] +6, making it 3+6=9. Then nums[i-1] is 5, 9 is larger. Wait, but that seems like overkill. Because 5 - 3 is 2. So the difference a is 2. To make nums[i] >5, the current nums[i] is 3. Adding d once (2) would make it 5, which is equal. Not enough. So need to add another d, making it 7. So a=5-7= -2. So yes, adding (a//d +1) steps. Wait, wait, let's take a=2, d=2. Then (a//d) is 1. So steps =1+1=2. So 2*2=4 added. Original nums[i] is 3. Adding 4 makes it 7, which is 7-5=2. So previous is 5, current is 7. So difference is -2. So that's correct. So the formula works.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables:\n\nWe need to read n and d, then read n numbers into an array.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the array, we can use:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: nums(:)\nread(*,*) n, d\nallocate(nums(n))\nread(*,*) nums\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when reading an array, you can read all elements in one line, but the input is probably given as space-separated numbers. So for example, if the input is:\n\n3 2\n4 1 3\n\nThe first line is n and d, the second line is the three elements.\n\nSo in the code, after reading n and d, allocate nums(n), then read the next line into nums.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using read(*,*) nums, it will read as many numbers as needed. So the code should work.\n\nThen, initialize result as 0, a as 0.\n\nThen loop from i=2 to n.\n\nFor each i:\n\na = nums(i-1) - nums(i)\n\nif a >=0, then compute steps = a/d +1\n\nresult = result + steps\n\nnums(i) = nums(i) + steps*d\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but when both operands are integers, it truncates towards zero. So same as Java.\n\nBut in Java, if a is negative, division is towards zero, but in Fortran, same. So 5/2 is 2 in both. So the same calculation.\n\nSo translating that loop:\n\ndo i = 2, n\n\na = nums(i-1) - nums(i)\n\nif (a >=0) then\n\nsteps = a / d + 1\n\nresult = result + steps\n\nnums(i) = nums(i) + steps * d\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nThen print result.\n\nNow, some Fortran specific things:\n\n- Variables need to be declared. So in Fortran, the variables are:\n\ninteger :: n, d, result, a, steps, i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: nums(:)\n\nThen, reading:\n\nread(*,*) n, d\n\nallocate(nums(n))\n\nread(*,*) nums\n\nThen initialize result to 0.\n\nThen the loop.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. So the code should work as the array is read into 1-based indices.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nSample input: Let's see. Suppose the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n4 1 3\n\nSo n=3, d=2.\n\nThe array is [4,1,3]\n\nFirst iteration i=2:\n\nnums(1) =4, nums(2)=1. a=3.\n\n3 >=0. steps =3/2 +1=1+1=2. result=0+2=2. nums(2) becomes 1 +2*2=5. Now the array is [4,5,3]\n\nNext iteration i=3:\n\nnums(2)=5, nums(3)=3. a=2. steps=2/2+1=1+1=2. result=2+2=4. nums(3)=3+2*2=7. array becomes [4,5,7]\n\nSo the result is 4, which is printed.\n\nBut according to the original code, let's see:\n\nJava code for input 3 2, 4 1 3:\n\nLoop i=1 (since i starts at 1, but since n=3, loop runs for i=1 and 2 (since i <n, i from 0 to 2? Wait wait Java code:\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i = 1; i < n; i++). So for n=3, i runs from 1 to 2 (since i <3). So in first iteration i=1, comparing nums[0] and nums[1]. Then i=2, comparing nums[1] and nums[2].\n\nOriginal array: [4,1,3]\n\nFirst iteration i=1:\n\nnums[0]=4, nums[1]=1. a=3. steps=3/2 +1=1+1=2. result=2. nums[1] becomes 5.\n\nSecond iteration i=2:\n\nnums[1]=5, nums[2]=3. a=2. steps=2/2+1=2. result=4. nums[2] becomes 7.\n\nSo output is 4, same as Fortran code.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if a is exactly divisible by d? For example, a=4, d=2. steps=4/2 +1=2+1=3. Then 3*2=6 added. So the new nums[i] is original +6, which is 6 more than previous. So previous is, say, 5. Original current is 5-4=1. Then adding 6 makes it 7. So previous is 5, current is7. So difference is -2. So correct.\n\nAnother case: a=0. Then steps=0/d +1=0+1=1. So add d once. So current becomes previous +d. So previous is same as current, then add d. So current becomes previous +d, which is larger. So correct.\n\nNow, code in Fortran:\n\nSo the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_11_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, d, result, a, steps, i\n    integer, allocatable :: nums(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n, d\n    allocate(nums(n))\n    read(*,*) nums\n    \n    result = 0\n    do i = 2, n\n        a = nums(i-1) - nums(i)\n        if (a >= 0) then\n            steps = a / d + 1\n            result = result + steps\n            nums(i) = nums(i) + steps * d\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *, result\nend program codeforces_11_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array indices start at 1 by default. So when we read nums, the first element is nums(1), second nums(2), etc. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when you read into an array, the elements are filled in order. So the code should work.\n\nTesting the example again.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=2, d=1. Input numbers 5 and 3.\n\nOriginal code:\n\ni=1 (since n=2, loop runs once). a=5-3=2. steps=2/1+1=3. result=3. nums[1] becomes 3+3*1=6. Now the array is 5,6. Output 3.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=2 (loop from 2 to 2). a = nums(1) - nums(2) =5-3=2. steps=2+1=3. result 3. So same.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=0. For example, n=2, d=3. nums=4,4. Then a=0. steps=0/3 +1=1. So nums[2] becomes 4+3=7. So result is 1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as written above."
