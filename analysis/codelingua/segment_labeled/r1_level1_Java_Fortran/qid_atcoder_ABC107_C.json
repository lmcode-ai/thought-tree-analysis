  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads N and K, then an array S of N integers. It computes a minimum answer based on certain conditions. The main logic is in the if-else blocks. \n\nFirst, when K is 1, it finds the element with the smallest absolute value. For other cases, when N-K isn't zero, it iterates through possible subarrays of length K. For each subarray, it calculates the minimum time based on the positions of the leftmost and rightmost elements. If the subarray spans negative and positive numbers, it considers two scenarios: going left then right, or right then left. Otherwise, it takes the maximum of the absolute values. \n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Fortran. \n\nFortran uses arrays, so I'll need to read the array S. The input handling in Fortran is a bit different. I'll read N and K first, then read N values into an array. \n\nIn Java, the array is zero-based, but Fortran arrays are usually one-based. Wait, but in the Java code, the loop runs from 0 to N-K inclusive. Hmm, so when N-K is the upper limit for i, the subarrays are from i to i+K-1. For Fortran, if we use one-based indexing, the loop would run from 1 to N-K+1? Wait, let's check. For example, if N is 5 and K is 3, then in Java, i goes up to 5-3=2 (since indices start at 0). So in Fortran's one-based, it would be up to (5-3+1) = 3? Let me see: in Java, i can be 0,1,2. In Fortran, i would be 1,2,3. So the equivalent loop would be i from 1 to N-K+1. Then the subarray is from i to i+K-1. Because for i=1, the end is 1+3-1=3, which covers 3 elements. That's correct.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose N=5, K=3. In Java, the loop runs for i=0,1,2. The subarrays are [0,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,4]. In Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the indices would be 1-3, 2-4, 3-5. So the loop would run from 1 to (5-3+1) =3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the loop in the else if (N-K !=0) part, the equivalent in Fortran is i from 1 to (N-K+1). Wait, because in Java, the loop runs for i from 0 to (N-K) inclusive. Because the condition is i <= N-K. For example, if N-K is 2, then i can be 0,1,2. So the total number of iterations is (N-K+1). So in Fortran, if we have to run the same number of iterations, starting from 1, the loop would be from i=1 to (N-K+1). Wait, no. Let's see. The Java loop is: for (i=0; i <= N-K; i++). So the number of iterations is (N-K+1). So in Fortran, if we loop from 1 to (N-K+1), that's the same number of iterations. Then, for each iteration, the subarray starts at i, and ends at i + K -1. But in Fortran, i starts at 1, so the first subarray is 1 to 1+K-1= K. Which is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code would have something like:\n\ndo i = 1, (N-K+1)\n   min_val = S(i)\n   max_val = S(i+K-1)\n   ... calculations ...\nend do\n\nNow, the array S needs to be sorted? Wait, looking at the Java code, the array S is input as integers. Wait, but the logic of the code seems to be that the array is sorted. Because the code accesses S[i] and S[i+K-1], and assumes that in the subarray of K elements, the first is the leftmost (minimum) and the last is the rightmost (maximum). So maybe the array S is sorted in ascending order. Because in the Java code, when it takes S[i] and S[i+K-1], it's assuming that S is ordered. Otherwise, the min and max could be in any positions. So perhaps the array S is sorted. But the Java code reads the array directly from input, without sorting. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, unless the input is given in sorted order. Or maybe the code is incorrect. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the positions are in a line, sorted. For example, if the problem is about candles placed on a line, where each position is given in order. Then the array S is sorted. So the code can process it as such.\n\nAssuming that the input array S is sorted. So in Fortran, we need to read the array and process it as sorted. But the original code doesn't sort the array. So perhaps the problem expects the input array to be sorted. So the Fortran code can read the array as is, assuming it's sorted.\n\nNext, the Java code has three cases: K=1, N-K !=0 (which is the same as K < N?), and else. Let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nif K ==1:\n\n   find the minimum absolute value in the array.\n\nelse if (N-K !=0):\n\n   then loop through the possible starting indices.\n\nWait, N-K !=0 is equivalent to K != N. Because if K equals N, then N-K is zero, so this else if is not taken, and the else clause is executed. So the else clause is when K == N. So for K==N, the code takes the entire array. So in the else part, the code computes based on the first and last elements.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code structure will be similar.\n\nNow, handling input:\n\nIn Fortran, to read the array, we can read N and K first, then read N integers into an array S.\n\nIn the code:\n\nread(*,*) N, K\n\nallocate(S(N))\n\nread(*,*) S\n\nBut in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So when the code uses S[i], in Java it's S[i-1] in Fortran.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code in Java has:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nIn Fortran, the array S is 1-based. So when processing the code, the indices are adjusted.\n\nSo when the code in Java uses S[i], in Fortran it's S(i+1). But in the loop for the subarrays, for example, in Java the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= N-K; i++) {\n   int min = S[i];\n   int max = S[i + K -1];\n   ...\n}\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the loop would be i from 1 to (N-K+1), and then min_val is S(i), max_val is S(i + K -1 -1 +1)? Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the subarray starts at index i and ends at i+K-1. For K elements. For example, i=0, K=3: indices 0,1,2. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the same elements would be i=1, K=3: indices 1,2,3. So in Fortran, the start index is i, and the end index is i + K -1. Because 1+3-1 =3. So that's correct. So in Fortran, the code for the loop would be:\n\ndo i=1, (N-K+1)\n   min_val = S(i)\n   max_val = S(i + K -1)\n   ...\nend do\n\nWhich is equivalent to the Java code's S[i] and S[i+K-1].\n\nSo the array indices in Fortran are adjusted correctly.\n\nNow, handling the conditional cases:\n\nCase 1: K ==1.\n\nIn this case, loop through all elements and find the minimum absolute value.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop from 1 to N, compute the absolute value, track the minimum.\n\nCase 2: N-K !=0 \u2192 which is equivalent to K < N.\n\nSo when K < N, then loop through the possible starting indices. Compute for each window.\n\nElse (when K ==N), then take the entire array.\n\nIn the else case, the code in Java checks if min (S[0]) is negative and max (S[N-1]) is positive. Then computes the minimum of two possibilities. Otherwise, takes the maximum of absolute values.\n\nNow, let's translate the code step by step.\n\nFirst, read N and K. Then read S.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, i, temp, ans\n    integer, allocatable :: S(:)\n    read(*,*) N, K\n    allocate(S(N))\n    do i=1, N\n        read(*,*) S(i)\n    end do\n\n    ans = 1000000000\n\n    if (K == 1) then\n        do i=1, N\n            temp = abs(S(i))\n            if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n        end do\n        print*, ans\n    else if (N > K) then  ! Because N-K !=0 \u2192 N-K >0 \u2192 N > K. So else if (N > K)\n        do i=1, (N-K+1)\n            integer :: min_val, max_val\n            min_val = S(i)\n            max_val = S(i + K -1)\n            if (min_val < 0 .and. max_val > 0) then\n                temp = min(2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val)\n            else\n                temp = max(abs(min_val), abs(max_val))\n            end if\n            if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n        end do\n        print*, ans\n    else  ! K == N\n        min_val = S(1)\n        max_val = S(N)\n        if (min_val <0 .and. max_val >0) then\n            ans = min(2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val)\n        else\n            ans = max(abs(min_val), abs(max_val))\n        end if\n        print*, ans\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(S)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables declared inside a loop (like min_val and max_val inside the do loop) are not allowed. Variables must be declared in the declaration section. So I need to declare min_val and max_val outside the loop.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, i, temp, ans, min_val, max_val\n    integer, allocatable :: S(:)\n    read(*,*) N, K\n    allocate(S(N))\n    do i=1, N\n        read(*,*) S(i)\n    end do\n\n    ans = 1000000000\n\n    if (K == 1) then\n        do i=1, N\n            temp = abs(S(i))\n            if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n        end do\n        print*, ans\n    else if (N > K) then\n        do i=1, (N-K+1)\n            min_val = S(i)\n            max_val = S(i + K -1)\n            if (min_val < 0 .and. max_val > 0) then\n                temp = min(2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val)\n            else\n                temp = max(abs(min_val), abs(max_val))\n            end if\n            if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n        end do\n        print*, ans\n    else\n        min_val = S(1)\n        max_val = S(N)\n        if (min_val <0 .and. max_val >0) then\n            ans = min(2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val)\n        else\n            ans = max(abs(min_val), abs(max_val))\n        end if\n        print*, ans\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(S)\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the function min takes two arguments. So when using min(a, b), that's okay. Similarly for max. So the code should work.\n\nTesting with sample input. Let's take the example where N=5, K=3, and S = [-3, -2, 1, 4, 5]. The Java code would process this.\n\nIn the else if (N > K) case. For each i from 1 to 5-3+1=3.\n\ni=1: subarray [-3,-2,1]. min_val=-3, max_val=1. Since min <0 and max>0: compute 2*3 +1=7 and 3 + 2*1=5. Take min(7,5)=5. ans is 5.\n\ni=2: subarray [-2,1,4]. min_val=-2, max_val=4. 2*2 +4=8, 2+2*4=10. min 8. Current ans is 5.\n\ni=3: subarray [1,4,5]. min_val=1 (positive), max_val=5. So temp = max(1,5)=5. ans remains 5.\n\nSo the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nThe Fortran code should compute the same.\n\nAnother test case: when K equals N. For example, N=3, K=3, S = [-5, -3, 2]. min_val is -5, max_val is 2. So compute 2*5 +2=12 and 5 + 2*2=9. min is 9. So the code should output 9.\n\nIn Fortran, this else case would handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran uses integer division and operators. But in this code, all operations are integer additions and multiplications.\n\n- The array indices are correctly converted from Java's 0-based to Fortran's 1-based.\n\n- The initial value of ans is 1e9, which is 1000000000. In Fortran, integer can handle that if using 4-byte integers. But in some compilers, default integers may be 4 bytes. But 1e9 is within the 32-bit signed integer range (up to 2^31-1 ~2e9). So 1e9 is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work correctly."
