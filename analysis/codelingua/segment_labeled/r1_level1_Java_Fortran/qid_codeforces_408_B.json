  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main function reads two strings, s1 and s2. It checks if s2 contains any characters not present in s1 using the isValid function. If not valid, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of each character in both strings using HashMaps (m1 and m2). Then, for each unique character in s2, it adds the minimum of the counts from m1 and m2 to the answer. The result is the sum of these minima.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps, so I'll need to simulate them using arrays. Since characters are likely in a certain range, maybe using ASCII values. Let's assume the characters are lowercase letters. Wait, the problem might not specify, but Java's code uses characters, so perhaps we can use their ASCII values. Let's check: in Java, 'char' is 16-bit, but for typical inputs, maybe a-z. So in Fortran, I can create arrays of size 256 (for all possible ASCII characters) to count occurrences.\n\nSo for counting in Java's m1 and m2, I'll have two integer arrays in Fortran, say count1 and count2, each of size 256. Then loop through each character in s1 and increment the count at the corresponding ASCII position. Same for s2.\n\nThe isValid function checks if all characters in s2 are present in s1. So in Fortran, I can create a logical array of size 256. For each character in s1, mark the array as true. Then loop through s2 and check if any character is not marked. If any, return false.\n\nThen, for the main calculation: iterate over each character in s2, but ensure each character is processed only once. So I need a way to track which characters have been processed. Another logical array (processed) of size 256. For each character in s2, if not processed, add the minimum of count1 and count2 for that character to the answer, then mark as processed.\n\nNow, how to handle the input. The Java code reads two strings using Scanner. In Fortran, we can read the two strings from standard input. But need to make sure there are no leading/trailing spaces. Use read(*,*) s1 and s2.\n\nWait, Fortran's read can sometimes read entire lines, but for this case, since the input is two separate strings, using read(*,*) s1, s2 would work, assuming they are space-separated.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read s1 and s2.\n\n2. Check validity. For validity:\n   a. Create a presence array (logical) for characters in s1.\n   b. For each character in s2, check if presence is false. If any, output -1.\n\n3. If valid:\n   a. Count characters in s1 into count1.\n   b. Count characters in s2 into count2.\n   c. For each character in s2, if not processed, add min(count1(c), count2(c)) to ans, and mark as processed.\n\nSo let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, declaring variables:\n\nCharacter(len=1000) :: s1, s2  ! Assuming max length 1000\nLogical :: valid\nInteger :: count1(0:255), count2(0:255)\nLogical :: present(0:255), processed(0:255)\nInteger :: ans, i, c\nCharacter :: ch\n\nInitialize count1 and count2 to 0.\n\nRead the input strings:\nread(*,*) s1\nread(*,*) s2\n\nThen, check validity:\n\npresent = .false.\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n   c = iachar(s1(i:i))\n   present(c) = .true.\nend do\n\nvalid = .true.\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s2)\n   c = iachar(s2(i:i))\n   if (.not. present(c)) then\n      valid = .false.\n      exit\n   end if\nend do\n\nIf not valid, print -1.\n\nElse, count occurrences:\n\ncount1 = 0\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n   c = iachar(s1(i:i))\n   count1(c) = count1(c) + 1\nend do\n\ncount2 = 0\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s2)\n   c = iachar(s2(i:i))\n   count2(c) = count2(c) + 1\nend do\n\nThen, calculate ans:\n\nans = 0\nprocessed = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s2)\n   c = iachar(s2(i:i))\n   if (.not. processed(c)) then\n      processed(c) = .true.\n      ans = ans + min(count1(c), count2(c))\n   end if\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the characters in s2 are processed in the order they appear, but to avoid duplicates, a HashSet is used. So in Fortran, as we loop through each character of s2, we check if it's already processed. If not, we add the min and mark it as processed. That's exactly what the code above does.\n\nNow, some potential issues:\n\n- The original Java code's HashMaps are case-sensitive. So the Fortran code will also be case-sensitive since it's using ASCII values.\n\n- The strings in Fortran have trailing spaces when read with fixed length. But using len_trim ensures we process only the actual characters.\n\nEdge cases: If s1 is empty and s2 is not, then validity is false. If s2 is empty, ans is zero.\n\nTesting the code with sample input. For example:\n\nSample Input 1:\naabb\nab\n\nJava code's m1 counts a:2, b:2. m2 counts a:1, b:1. The ans is 1+1=2.\n\nFortran code would process each character in s2 (a and b). So ans is 2.\n\nAnother sample: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"aabba\". The counts for a:2, b:2 in s2, and a:1, b:1, c:1 in s1. So min for a is 1, b is 1. So ans is 2.\n\nNow, the code should handle that.\n\nPotential bugs:\n\n- Forgetting to initialize the count arrays to zero. In Fortran, local variables are not initialized by default. So in the code, must set count1 and count2 to 0 before counting.\n\nBut in the code above, after declaration, they are initialized as:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer arrays can be initialized by assignment. So yes.\n\nBut in Fortran 90 and later, that's allowed. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing: when reading s1 and s2, if the input strings have leading or trailing spaces, but in Java's next() method, the Scanner reads tokens, which are by default whitespace-separated. So the Fortran read(*,*) s1 and s2 will read the next tokens, ignoring leading/trailing spaces. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work."
