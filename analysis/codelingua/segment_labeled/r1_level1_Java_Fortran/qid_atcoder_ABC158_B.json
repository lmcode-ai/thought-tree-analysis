But in Fortran, I might not need to replicate those checks unless specified, but the original code includes them. Wait, in the Java code, those are part of an if statement that encloses all the logic. So the rest of the code only executes if those conditions are met. So in Fortran, I need to replicate that structure.\n\nThe main logic seems to be:\n\nIf A + B <= N, then compute k = N divided by (A+B). Then check if the remainder (N - k*(A+B)) is greater than A. If so, output A*k + (remainder - (remainder - A)), which simplifies to A*k + A. Otherwise, output A*k + remainder.\n\nWait, let's see: the Java code's if condition inside the first case is if (N - k*(A+B) > A), then the output is A*k + (N - k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)). Let's simplify that part.\n\nN - k*(A+B) is the remainder. Let's call that rem = N - k*(A+B).\n\nIf rem > A, then the output is A*k + rem - (rem - A) = A*k + A.\n\nBecause (rem - (rem - A)) is A. Because N - (k*(A+B) + A) would be N - k*(A+B) - A = rem - A. So (rem - (rem - A)) is A.\n\nSo in that case, it's adding A instead of the remainder. Because if the remainder is more than A, then the maximum blue balls you can have is A in that cycle. So the total is k full cycles (each contributing A) plus A, not the entire remainder.\n\nIf the remainder is <=A, then add the remainder.\n\nIn the else case, if A+B > N, check if A <= N.

Because you can't have more blue balls than N.\n\nSo the logic is:\n\nTotal blue balls = (number of full cycles * A) + min(remainder, A) when there are full cycles. Otherwise, take min(A, N).\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, read N, A, B. Since in Java they are long, in Fortran, they should be integers with kind=8 or using integer(kind=8). Or maybe default integer might not be sufficient because N can be up to 1e18. So we need to use 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, we can declare them as integer*8 variables.\n\nIn Fortran, reading input can be done with read *, N, A, B.\n\nThen, check the conditions. But in Fortran, logical conditions are a bit different. So the if statement should check whether N is between 1 and 1e18, A and B are >=0, and A+B is between 1 and 1e18. But the Java code uses Math.pow(10,18), which is 1e18. So in Fortran, 1e18 can be represented as 10**18. But since we are dealing with integers, perhaps using 10**18_8 to specify the kind. But in Fortran, 10**18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros, which is 1000000000000000000. So for the condition:\n\nif (N >= 1 .and. N <= 1e18 .and. A >=0 .and. B >=0 .and. (A+B) >0 .and. (A+B) <=1e18) then\n\nWait, but in Java, the check is 0 <= A and 0 <= B, and 0 < A + B. So the Fortran equivalent would be A >=0, B >=0, (A+B) >0. So the conditions in the if statement.\n\nOnce the conditions are satisfied, proceed with the logic.\n\nNow, in the first part, when A+B <= N. Compute k = N/(A+B). Since N and A+B are integers, in Java this is integer division. So in Fortran, we use the / operator but since all variables are integers, division truncates towards zero, same as Java. So k = N/(A+B).\n\nThen calculate rem = N - k*(A+B). Then check if rem > A. If so, the total is A*k + A. Otherwise, A*k + rem.\n\nWait, the Java code for that part is:\n\nif (N - k * (A + B) > A) {\n    System.out.println(A * k + (N - k * (A + B)) - (N - (k * (A + B) + A)));\n} else {\n    System.out.println(A * k + (N - k * (A + B)));\n}\n\nLet me compute that subtraction part.\n\nThe first term is (N - k*(A+B)) which is rem. The second part is (N - (k*(A+B) + A)) which is N - k*(A+B) -A = rem - A.\n\nSo subtracting these two gives rem - (rem -A) = A. So the total becomes A*k + A.

So in Fortran, we have to enclose all the logic inside that if block. But in the original Java code, the else parts (the else if and else) are inside that main if condition. So the Fortran code should have the same.\n\nBut I think the code is correct. Let me test with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: N=8, A=3, B=2. A+B=5 <=8. k=1, rem=3. rem>3? No. So total=3*1 +3=6. Wait rem is 3, which is equal to A. So in code, since rem <=A, total is 3+3=6. So output 6.\n\nAnother test case: N=10, A=3, B=3. A+B=6 <=10. k=1 (10/6=1), rem=4. 4>3: yes. So total is 3*1 +3=6.\n\nAnother case: A+B=5, N=9. k=1, rem=4. rem>3? yes. So 3*1+3=6.\n\nAnother case where A+B > N. For example, N=5, A=3, B=3. A+B=6>5. Then check if A <=5: yes. Output 3.\n\nIf N=5, A=6, B=1. A+B=7>5. A=6>5. So output 5.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle all these cases.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using integer*8, the variables are 8-byte integers, which can hold up to 9e18, so 1e18 is okay.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
