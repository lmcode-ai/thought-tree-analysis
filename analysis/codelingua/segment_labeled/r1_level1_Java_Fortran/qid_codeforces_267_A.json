In Fortran, the main program would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_267_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, a, b\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) a, b\n\n        write(*,*) sub(a, b)\n\n    end do\n\ncontains\n\n    function sub(a, b) result(res)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n\n        integer :: res, min_val, max_val, remainder\n\n        res = 0\n\n        min_val = min(a, b)\n\n        max_val = max(a, b)\n\n        do while (min_val > 0)\n\n            res = res + (max_val / min_val)\n\n            remainder = mod(max_val, min_val)\n\n            max_val = min_val\n\n            min_val = remainder\n\n        end do\n\n    end function sub\n\nend program codeforces_267_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nSo, the Java code reads an integer n from the input. Then, for each of the n test cases, it reads two integers a and b. It calls the sub function with these two numbers and prints the result. The sub function seems to compute some kind of step count based on repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one, similar to the Euclidean algorithm but counting the number of divisions.\n\nFirst, I'll need to replicate the structure in Fortran. Fortran programs start with a program block. Let's outline the main steps.\n\nIn Java, the main method uses a Scanner to read inputs. In Fortran, I'll use READ statements. The loop for n test cases is straightforward with a DO loop.\n\nThe sub function in Java takes two integers and returns an integer. In Fortran, this would be a function. The logic inside the sub function involves a while loop (DO WHILE in Fortran), swapping max and min each iteration, and accumulating the result.\n\nLet me break down the sub function. The variables min and max are initialized as the smaller and larger of a and b. Then, while min is greater than 0, add max divided by min to the result. Then set max to max mod min, then swap min and max again. So, similar to the Euclidean algorithm steps but keeping track of how many times we subtract, which is essentially the quotient in each division step.\n\nNow, translating that into Fortran. The function will have to take a and b as inputs. Let's see:\n\nFunction sub(a, b) result(res). Then, inside, set min_val and max_val using MIN and MAX functions. Then a loop that continues while min_val > 0. Inside the loop: add (max_val / min_val) to result. Then set max_val to mod(max_val, min_val). Then set new min and max. So, after the mod, the new values would be min_val = MIN(old_min, new_max), max_val = MAX(...). Wait, no. After mod, the new max is the old min, and the new min is the mod result? Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal Java code after division:\n\nmax = max % min;\nThen, set curr_min as the min of min and max (which is the new max and the mod result). Wait, maybe I need to swap them. For example, suppose max was 10, min was 3. After division, result += 3 (since 10 /3 is 3). Then max becomes 1 (10%3). Then curr_min is min(3,1) which is 1, curr_max is max(3,1)=3. So min becomes 1, max becomes 3. Then in the next iteration, result += 3/1=3, max becomes 0. Then min becomes 0, so loop stops. So total result is 3+3=6.\n\nSo in each step, after computing max mod min, the next step is to set the new min as the minimum between the previous min and the new max (which is the mod result). Then the new max is the maximum of the two.\n\nIn Fortran, after calculating the mod, I can compute the new min and max as min_val = min(old_min, new_max), max_val = max(...). Wait, no. Wait, after max becomes max%min, which is a value less than min (since it's the remainder). Then, the new pair is (max%min, min). But since we need to always have min <= max in the next iteration, perhaps the new min and max are the new max (the remainder) and the original min. Wait, but after the mod, the remainder is less than the original min. So the new max would be the original min, and the new min would be the remainder. So for the next iteration, min is the remainder, which is smaller than the new max (original min). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nSuppose original min is 3, max is 10. Then after the first step, max becomes 10%3=1. Then, the new min and max would be 1 and 3. Because 1 is smaller than 3. So yes, the next step is to swap them. So the new min is 1, max is 3.\n\nSo in the Java code, after doing max = max%min, then min and max are swapped based on which is smaller. So, the next step is to set curr_min as the min of min and max (the new values after mod), and curr_max as the max. Then, set min = curr_min, max = curr_max. So in Fortran, after calculating the mod, we need to compute the new min and max as the min and max of the previous min and the new max (which is the mod result).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nresult += max_val / min_val\n\nremainder = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\nthen, new_max = MAX(min_val, remainder)\n\nnew_min = MIN(min_val, remainder)\n\nWait, no. Because the remainder is max_val % min_val, which is less than min_val. So remainder is less than min_val. So when you take min_val and remainder, the min is remainder, and the max is min_val. So in code:\n\ntemp = remainder\n\nnew_max = min_val\n\nnew_min = temp\n\nWait, but that would only be true if remainder is less than min_val, which it is. Because when you compute max_val % min_val, the remainder is in 0..min_val-1.\n\nSo perhaps after computing the remainder, the new_max is min_val, and the new_min is remainder.\n\nSo in code:\n\nremainder = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\nnew_min = MIN(remainder, min_val)\n\nnew_max = MAX(remainder, min_val)\n\nBut since remainder < min_val, MIN is remainder, MAX is min_val.\n\nSo then, in Fortran:\n\nmax_val = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\nThen, temp = max_val\n\nmax_val = min_val\n\nmin_val = temp\n\nWait, that's another way to swap. Because after the MOD, the new remainder is stored in max_val (since Java code does max = max % min). Then, in Java code, they take the curr_min and curr_max as min and max (after the mod). Wait, let me re-examine the Java code:\n\nAfter max = max % min, then:\n\ncurr_min = Math.min(min, max);\n\ncurr_max = Math.max(min, max);\n\nSo, after the mod, the new max is the remainder (max % min), and the new min is the original min. Wait, no. Wait, no: after the mod, the variables min and max are the original min and the new max (the remainder). Then, curr_min is the minimum of min (original) and max (the remainder). Since the remainder is less than min, curr_min is the remainder, curr_max is min. Then, min is set to curr_min (remainder), max to curr_max (original min).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint curr_min = Math.min(min, max); // here, min is original, max is remainder.\n\nWhich is same as:\n\nif (remainder < min) then curr_min is remainder, else min.\n\nBut remainder is always less than min (since it's the result of max % min when max was >= min). So curr_min is remainder, curr_max is min.\n\nSo after that, min becomes remainder, max becomes min (original).\n\nSo in Fortran, after doing the mod, the code would set:\n\ntemp = min_val\n\nmin_val = MOD(max_val, min_val)  -- Wait, no. Wait, the original max_val and min_val were, say, 10 and 3.\n\nmax_val was 10, min_val 3.\n\nmax_val becomes 10 % 3 = 1. So now, max_val is 1. Then, curr_min is min(3,1) = 1. curr_max is max(3,1) =3. So min becomes 1, max becomes 3.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the mod, the new max_val is min_val, and the new min_val is the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\nremainder = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\nmax_val = min_val\n\nmin_val = remainder\n\nBecause after the mod, the new max is the original min_val, and the new min is the remainder.\n\nYes, because in the next step, we are swapping the roles. So the remainder is the new min, and the original min becomes the new max.\n\nSo for example, after the first step, max_val and min_val are 10 and 3. After mod, remainder is 1. Then, the new max is 3 (original min_val), and new min is 1 (remainder).\n\nSo in code:\n\nremainder = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\nmax_val = min_val\n\nmin_val = remainder\n\nThat would correctly update the variables for the next iteration.\n\nAh, this is a more efficient way to do it. So the Java code computes the curr_min and curr_max each time, but in reality, since the remainder is less than min_val, the new max is min_val, and the new min is the remainder.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the mod, set max_val to min_val and min_val to the remainder. Then loop continues.\n\nSo this simplifies the code. Let me adjust that.\n\nIn the sub function:\n\nInitialize min_val and max_val as min(a,b) and max(a,b).\n\nresult = 0\n\nDO WHILE (min_val > 0)\n\n   result = result + (max_val / min_val)\n\n   remainder = MOD(max_val, min_val)\n\n   max_val = min_val\n\n   min_val = remainder\n\nEND DO\n\nWait, that's a better approach and avoids the extra comparisons. Because after the mod, the remainder is less than min_val. So the new max is the previous min_val, and the new min is the remainder.\n\nYes, this would work.\n\nSo that's a more efficient way to write the loop.\n\nSo now, the Fortran code can be structured as:\n\nfunction sub(a, b) result(res)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n\n    integer :: res, min_val, max_val, remainder\n\n    res = 0\n\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n\n    do while (min_val > 0)\n\n        res = res + (max_val / min_val)\n\n        remainder = mod(max_val, min_val)\n\n        max_val = min_val\n\n        min_val = remainder\n\n    end do\n\nend function sub\n\nThen, the main program needs to read n, then loop n times, read a and b, compute sub(a,b), and print.\n\nIn Fortran, the main program would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_267_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, a, b\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) a, b\n\n        write(*,*) sub(a, b)\n\n    end do\n\ncontains\n\n    function sub(a, b) result(res)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n\n        integer :: res, min_val, max_val, remainder\n\n        res = 0\n\n        min_val = min(a, b)\n\n        max_val = max(a, b)\n\n        do while (min_val > 0)\n\n            res = res + (max_val / min_val)\n\n            remainder = mod(max_val, min_val)\n\n            max_val = min_val\n\n            min_val = remainder\n\n        end do\n\n    end function sub\n\nend program codeforces_267_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared. Also, the function sub is inside the program's contains section, which makes it an internal function.\n\nBut in some Fortran compilers, the order is important. The main program starts with 'program ...', then variable declarations, then the code. Then 'contains' and the functions.\n\nYes, this structure should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input. Let's say, for example, if input is:\n\n3\n\n10 3\n\n5 5\n\n4 6\n\nThe Java code would compute:\n\nFor 10 and 3:\n\nsub(10,3) would be 3 (10/3=3, remainder 1. Then next step is 3 and 1. 3/1=3, remainder 0. So total 3+3=6.\n\nWait, the Java code's sub function returns 6 for a=10, b=3? Let's see:\n\nLet's walk through the code.\n\na=10, b=3. min=3, max=10.\n\nLoop: min>0.\n\nresult += 10/3=3 \u2192 result=3.\n\nmax = 10%3=1.\n\ncurr_min = min(3,1)=1, curr_max = max(3,1)=3.\n\nmin=1, max=3.\n\nNext loop: min>0.\n\nresult +=3/1=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nmax=3%1=0.\n\ncurr_min = min(1,0)=0, curr_max=1.\n\nmin=0 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nSo result is 6. So for 10 and 3, the answer is 6.\n\nSimilarly, for 5 and 5:\n\nresult +=5/5=1. max=0. loop stops. So result is 1.\n\nFor 4 and 6:\n\nmin=4, max=6.\n\nresult +=6/4=1 \u2192 result=1. max=6%4=2.\n\nnew max=4, min=2.\n\nloop: 2>0. 4/2=2 \u2192 result=3. max=0. loop stops. So result is 3.\n\nSo the output would be 6, 1, 3.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, when reading input, the first line is n, then n lines each with a and b. So the code reads correctly.\n\nPotential issues: in Fortran, when reading from standard input, each read statement reads a line. So if the input has all numbers on the same line, but in Java it's via Scanner which splits on any whitespace. But the user is probably inputting as per the problem statement, each test case on a separate line, but in the code, the read statements read a and b from a line. So the Fortran code should work as intended.\n\nAnother possible issue is the integer division. In Fortran, the division of integers (/) returns the truncated result, same as Java. So 10/3 is 3, etc.\n\nSo the code should work correctly.\n\nI think this should be the correct translation."
