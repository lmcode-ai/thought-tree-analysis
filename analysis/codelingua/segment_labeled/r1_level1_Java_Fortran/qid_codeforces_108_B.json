It sorts the array and then checks if there exists any consecutive elements where the next element is less than twice the current one, and they are not equal. If such a pair is found, it prints \"YES\" and exits; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be: read n, read the array, sort it, then loop through each pair of consecutive elements to check the condition.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses dynamic arrays, so I can allocate the array based on the input n. Let me start by handling input. In Java, they use Scanner, but in Fortran, I'll read from standard input using READ(*,*).\n\nThen, the sorting part. Java's Arrays.sort is straightforward, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function for arrays. Oh right, I need to implement a sorting algorithm. Since the original code sorts in ascending order, I'll need to sort the array in Fortran in the same way. Maybe use a simple bubble sort or find a way to sort. Alternatively, maybe use an intrinsic subroutine if available. Wait, Fortran has no built-in sort, so I need to implement it. Let's think: for small n, a bubble sort would be acceptable. But since the original code uses a quick sort, maybe implement a more efficient one. But for the purpose of translation, perhaps a simple sort is okay.\n\nWait, the Java code sorts in ascending order. So in Fortran, after sorting, the array is from smallest to largest. Let me proceed.\n\nOnce sorted, loop from i=1 to n-1 (since Fortran uses 1-based indexing). For each i, check if a(i+1) < 2*a(i) and a(i) /= a(i+1). If any such pair exists, print \"YES\" and stop. Else, after checking all, print \"NO\".\n\nWait, Java's loop runs from 0 to a.length-2, so for i from 0 to n-2 (since a.length is n). The Fortran equivalent would be from i=1 to n-1, since the array is 1-based. So in Java, a[i] and a[i+1] are consecutive. In Fortran, that's a(i) and a(i+1).\n\nSo the main steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Allocate array a of size n.\n\n3. Read n integers into a.\n\n4. Sort a in ascending order.\n\n5. Loop i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   if (a(i+1) < 2*a(i) .and. a(i) /= a(i+1)) then\n\n       print \"YES\" and exit.\n\n6. After loop, print \"NO\".\n\nNow, the main challenge is sorting the array in Fortran.\n\nImplementing a sort. Let's think: perhaps use a simple bubble sort. But for n up to whatever, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, use the minval and swap. Let's see. Let's write a subroutine to sort the array.\n\nAlternatively, here's a simple way to sort an array in ascending order using a selection sort approach:\n\nsubroutine sort(arr, n)\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n\n    integer :: i, j, temp\n\n    do i = 1, n-1\n\n        do j = i+1, n\n\n            if (arr(j) < arr(i)) then\n\n                temp = arr(i)\n\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n\n                arr(j) = temp\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n    end do\n\nend subroutine sort\n\nBut this is a O(n^2) approach, which may be acceptable for small n.

So in Fortran, since it's 1-based, the loop runs from i=1 to n-1. So for each i, compare a(i) and a(i+1).\n\nBut in Java, the sorted array is ascending. So a[i] <= a[i+1]. So in Fortran, after sorting, a(1) <= a(2) <= ... <= a(n). So the code checks each consecutive pair. If any pair has a[i+1] < 2*a[i], and a[i] != a[i+1], then output YES.\n\nSo the Fortran code should replicate this.\n\nTesting the code: for example, if the array is [1,2,3], sorted as [1,2,3]. Then, check 2 < 2*1? 2 < 2? No. Then check 3 < 2*2=4? Yes, but 3 is less than 4, and 2 !=3. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: [2,4]. Sorted as [2,4]. 4 < 2*2=4? No. So no. So output NO. Because 4 is not less than 4, it's equal.\n\nAnother case: [1,3]. 3 < 2*1=2? No. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: [1,1]. Check 1 < 2*1, but a[i] == a[i+1], so condition fails. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: [1,2]. 2 < 2*1=2? No, equal. So output NO.\n\nWait, but in Java code: the condition is a[i+1] < a[i]*2 and a[i] != a[i+1]. So in the case [1,3], 3 < 2*1 is 3 < 2? No. So no. So output NO.\n\nBut if the array is [3,5], then 5 < 6, so yes. So output YES.\n\nSo the code should capture that.\n\nSo the translation seems correct.\n\nNow, the only part left is the sorting. The selection sort implemented here will sort the array in ascending order, same as Java's Arrays.sort.\n\nTherefore, the code should work."
