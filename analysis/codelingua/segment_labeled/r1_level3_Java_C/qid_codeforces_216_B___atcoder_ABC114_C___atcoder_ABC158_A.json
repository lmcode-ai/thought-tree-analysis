  "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n However, note that the original programs read from stdin and write to stdout. We must avoid I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_216_B) reads two integers (m and n) and then n pairs of integers (edges). It outputs an integer (toremove).\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads an integer (N) and then does some processing to output an integer (c).\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string (s) and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But note: the output of the first is an integer, which becomes the input to the second (which expects an integer). The output of the second is an integer, which becomes the input to the third? \n However, the third program expects a string. \n\n We must adjust:\n  - The second program's input is the output of the first (an integer). We can represent it as a string? But the second program expects an integer from stdin.\n  - The third program expects a string. The second program outputs an integer. We can convert that integer to a string for the third.\n\n How to chain without I/O:\n  - We will simulate the entire chain in memory.\n  - Only the first program reads from stdin (in our case, we will read the entire input for the first program from stdin at the start).\n  - The output of the first program (an integer) is passed as input to the second program (which expects an integer). We note that the second program uses `gi()` which reads an integer from stdin. Instead, we will set the input of the second program to be the integer output by the first.\n  - The output of the second program (an integer) must be passed as a string to the third program. The third program expects a string. So we convert that integer to a string and then pass it as the input to the third program.\n\n However, note the third program: it checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the output of the second is an integer (which we convert to a string of digits), it will never contain the letter 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the third program will always output \"No\". \n\n But wait: the original chain is independent? Actually, the three programs are independent and meant to be run on separate inputs. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we are going to run:\n   Program1(input1) -> output1 (an integer)\n   Program2(output1) -> output2 (an integer)\n   Program3( string representation of output2 ) -> output3 (either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\n And then output3 is the final output.\n\n However, the original programs are written to read from stdin. We must refactor them to take input from a variable and not do any I/O (except the first reading from stdin and the last writing to stdout).\n\n Let's break down each program:\n\n Program1 (codeforces_216_B):\n   Input: two integers (m, n) and n pairs of integers (edges)\n   Output: an integer (toremove)\n\n   We will modify it to be a function that takes the input as arguments (or read from stdin only for the first program) and returns the integer.\n\n Program2 (atcoder_ABC114_C):\n   Input: an integer N (which will be the output of program1)\n   Output: an integer c\n\n   We will modify it to be a function that takes an integer (N) and returns an integer (c).\n\n Program3 (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n   Input: a string (which will be the string representation of the integer output from program2)\n   Output: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n   We will modify it to be a function that takes a string and returns a string (or prints it, but only the last output should be printed).\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So:\n   Step 1: Read the entire input for the first program (m, n, and the n edges) from stdin.\n   Step 2: Run the first program (simulated) and get the integer result (output1).\n   Step 3: Use output1 as the input to the second program (which we simulate as a function) and get output2 (an integer).\n   Step 4: Convert output2 to a string and use that string as the input to the third program (which we simulate as a function) and get the string result.\n   Step 5: Print that string.\n\n But note: the third program is checking for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'. Since the string we are passing is a number (digits only), it will never contain 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the third program will always output \"No\".\n\n However, let's look at the original chain: \n   The first program outputs an integer (say, 3).\n   The second program is run with input 3? Then it counts numbers that are made of 3,5,7 and are <= 3. The only number is 357? but 357>3? Actually, the second program starts at 357 and then increments in a special way? But when N=3, i starts at 357 (which is >3) so the loop doesn't run -> c=0. Then the third program gets the string \"0\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> outputs \"No\".\n\n But this is the chain? Actually, the problem states that the entire sequence of programs is run on the original input (which is the input of the first program). The output of the first becomes the input of the second, etc.\n\n How to structure the C program:\n\n   We will write:\n     int main() {\n         // Step 1: Read the input for the first program (m, n, and n edges)\n         int m, n;\n         scanf(\"%d %d\", &m, &n);\n         // Then read n edges\n         // ... but note: the first program uses a graph and does DFS.\n\n         // We will simulate the first program and get output1 (an integer)\n\n         // Step 2: Pass output1 as input to the second program (which we refactor to take an integer and return an integer)\n\n         // Step 3: Convert the integer output of the second to a string and pass to the third program (which we refactor to take a string and return a string)\n\n         // Step 4: Print the string result of the third program.\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n\n However, the second program (atcoder_ABC114_C) has a loop that generates numbers. We must refactor it to a function that takes an integer N and returns the count.\n\n The third program is simple: if the string contains both 'A' and 'B' then return \"Yes\", else \"No\". But note: the original third program checks for the presence of both characters? Actually, it checks if the string contains \"A\" and \"B\". Since the string we pass is a string of digits, it will never contain either, so it will always return \"No\".\n\n But wait: the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would run the three programs in sequence, with the output of one being the input of the next. So if we run the first program and get an integer, then run the second with that integer as input (via stdin) and then run the third with the second's output (as a string via stdin), then the third would get a string of digits and output \"No\".\n\n Therefore, our C program must do the same.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will create functions for the second and third programs.\n\n   First program (codeforces_216_B) is the most complex. We will translate it to C and embed it in the main function? Or create a function for it? Since it uses an object, we can refactor without the object.\n\n   Let's break down the first program:\n\n      It has:\n        - count (an int)\n        - seen (boolean array)\n        - two constants: path=0, cycle=1\n        - graph (a linked list of linked lists)\n\n      We can do:\n        We'll create a graph as an array of linked lists? But in C we can use dynamic arrays or we can use an array of arrays? However, the graph is built with m nodes.\n\n        Steps for the first program in C:\n\n          Read m, n.\n          Create an array of linked lists for graph? But we can use an array of vectors (if we use C++? but the problem says C). Alternatively, we can use an array of dynamic arrays? But we are to write in C.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\". We can use standard C.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            int m, n;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &m, &n);\n\n            // We'll create an adjacency list: we can use an array of arrays? But we don't know the degree of each node.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              int** graph = (int**)malloc((m+1) * sizeof(int*));\n              int* deg = (int*)calloc(m+1, sizeof(int)); // degrees\n              // We'll also create an array to store the edges? Actually, we can first store the edges and then build the graph.\n\n              But the first program reads the edges and adds both directions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a linked list in C? It's cumbersome. Instead, we can use an array of vectors if we use C++? But we are to write in C.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We'll use an array of dynamic arrays. We'll keep for each node a list of neighbors.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              int* graph[m+1]; // array of pointers to arrays of integers\n              int deg[m+1];    // degree of each node\n\n              But we don't know the degree in advance? So we can read the edges and count the degree? Then allocate.\n\n          Actually, we can do two passes: first count the degrees, then allocate, then store.\n\n          However, note: the original program uses a LinkedList of LinkedLists. We can simulate with:\n\n            We'll have an array of arrays. We'll also have an array for the current index (if we want to fill) but we don't need that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a single array for all edges? And then for each node, we can store the starting index in a big array? That's more complex.\n\n          Since m and n are the inputs, we can do:\n\n            int* graph[m+1];   // array of pointers to integers (each is an array of neighbors)\n            int deg[m+1];\n            for (int i=0; i<=m; i++) {\n                deg[i] = 0;\n                graph[i] = NULL;\n            }\n\n            Then for each edge (x,y), we do:\n                deg[x]++; deg[y]++;\n            Then allocate for each node:\n                for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\n                    graph[i] = (int*)malloc(deg[i] * sizeof(int));\n                }\n            Then we need to fill? We can use a temporary array for the current index? Or we can use a second array for the current index.\n\n          Actually, we can avoid two passes by using a linked list for the graph? But that would be heavy.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a 2D array? But the graph is undirected and the maximum degree is not known.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We'll use a 1D array for the entire graph and then an array of pointers to the start of each node's list.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              int* edges = (int*)malloc(2 * n * sizeof(int)); // each edge is stored twice (once for x and once for y)\n              int* graph[m+1];\n              int deg[m+1] = {0};\n\n              Then for each edge (x,y):\n                  deg[x]++; deg[y]++;\n\n              Then we can create an array of pointers and an index array:\n\n                  graph[0] = edges; // but we want separate for each node? We can do:\n\n                  int* ptr = edges;\n                  for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\n                      graph[i] = ptr;\n                      ptr += deg[i];\n                  }\n\n              Then we need to fill the graph. We can use a temporary array for the current index per node? We'll create an array `curr` of size m+1, initially 0.\n\n              Then for each edge (x,y):\n                  graph[x][curr[x]++] = y;\n                  graph[y][curr[y]++] = x;\n\n          But note: the original program uses 1-indexed for nodes? It starts from 1 to m.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            // Allocate memory for the graph storage: 2*n integers\n            int* storage = (int*)malloc(2 * n * sizeof(int));\n            // We also need an array to track the current index for each node for filling.\n            int* curr_index = (int*)calloc(m+1, sizeof(int));\n            // Then allocate graph: an array of pointers for nodes 1..m\n            int** graph = (int**)malloc((m+1) * sizeof(int*));\n            int* deg = (int*)calloc(m+1, sizeof(int));\n\n            // First pass: count degrees\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                int x, y;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &x, &y);\n                deg[x]++;\n                deg[y]++;\n            }\n\n            // Now set the pointers: graph[i] will point to a block of deg[i] integers\n            // But we are going to use the storage array? Actually, we can allocate separately for each node? Or we can allocate one big array.\n\n            // Since the total storage is 2*n, we can do:\n\n            graph[0] = NULL; // we don't use index0? The nodes are from 1 to m.\n            int* next_alloc = storage;\n            for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\n                graph[i] = next_alloc;\n                next_alloc += deg[i];\n            }\n\n            // Now we need to reset deg to 0 to use as current index? Actually, we have curr_index array for that.\n\n            // But we have to read the edges again? Yes, because we did one pass to get degrees.\n\n            // We can rewind the input? But we cannot. So we have to store the edges.\n\n            // Alternatively, we can store the edges in an array during the first pass? Then we don't have to read twice.\n\n            // How about we read all edges first and store in an array?\n\n            // Let's read the edges first:\n\n            int* edges_x = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            int* edges_y = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &edges_x[i], &edges_y[i]);\n                deg[edges_x[i]]++;\n                deg[edges_y[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            // Then allocate the graph arrays and set pointers as above.\n\n            // Then set curr_index to zeros for each node.\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                int x = edges_x[i], y = edges_y[i];\n                graph[x][curr_index[x]++] = y;\n                graph[y][curr_index[y]++] = x;\n            }\n\n            // Now we have the graph.\n\n          However, note: the original program does:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int x = sc.nextInt();\n                int y = sc.nextInt();\n                ft.graph.get(x).add(y);\n                ft.graph.get(y).add(x);\n            }\n\n          So we are building an undirected graph.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we cannot read the input twice. Therefore, we must store the edges.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler representation: we can use a 2D array? But m and n are not bounded (except by the input). We can use a vector? But in C, we can use linked lists? It might be heavy.\n\n   Another idea: we can use an array of linked lists? We can create a node for each edge.\n\n   However, for simplicity and to avoid dynamic allocation for each node, we'll do:\n\n        We'll use an array of arrays. We first read the entire input (including the edges) and store the edges. Then we count the degrees. Then we allocate an array for each node. Then we fill.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read m, n.\n        Step 2: Allocate arrays to store the edges: two arrays of size n for x and y.\n        Step 3: For i in [0, n-1]: read an edge (x, y) and store in edges_x[i], edges_y[i]. Also increment deg[x] and deg[y].\n        Step 4: Allocate an array of pointers (for graph) for nodes 1..m. Also allocate a storage array of total size = 2*n (for the undirected edges).\n        Step 5: Set pointers: \n            storage = (int*)malloc(2 * n * sizeof(int));\n            int* curr = (int*)calloc(m+1, sizeof(int)); // current index for each node's array\n            graph[1] = storage; \n            for (int i=2; i<=m; i++) {\n                graph[i] = graph[i-1] + deg[i-1];\n            }\n        Step 6: Then for each edge (x,y):\n            graph[x][curr[x]++] = y;\n            graph[y][curr[y]++] = y;   // wait, no: for y we add x? Actually, we are storing the neighbor.\n\n            Correction: \n                graph[x][curr[x]++] = y;\n                graph[y][curr[y]++] = x;\n\n        Step 7: Now we have the graph.\n\n   However, note: the storage for node i is of size deg[i]. We have allocated a contiguous block of 2*n integers. And we are using the entire block.\n\n   Now the DFS:\n\n        The original program has:\n\n            seen: boolean array of size m+1 (indexed 1..m) -> we'll use int array or bool array in C? We can use char array for seen.\n\n            count: a global in the object? Actually, the program uses an object. We can make it a local variable in the DFS? But note: the DFS in the original uses an instance variable `count` that is reset for each connected component.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            int toremove = 0;\n            char* seen = (char*)calloc(m+1, sizeof(char)); // 0 for false, 1 for true.\n\n            for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\n                if (!seen[i]) {\n                    int count = 0;\n                    // We'll do DFS starting at i, parent 0 (meaning none). \n                    // The DFS function: we need to pass the graph, deg, seen, and also update count by reference? Or we can use a global? We are in one function.\n\n                    // Let's write a DFS function:\n\n                    // But note: the DFS function in the original returns either cycle or path? Actually, it returns cycle (1) if it finds a cycle? How?\n\n                    // The DFS function:\n\n                    //   int dfs(int child, int par, int** graph, int* deg, char* seen, int* count) {\n                    //       if (seen[child]) return cycle;  // cycle? Actually, the original sets seen[child] at the beginning? And then if seen[child] is true, then we have a cycle? But wait: the first time we call, seen[child] is false.\n\n                    //   }\n\n            }\n\n        Actually, the DFS in the original:\n\n            public int dfs(int child, int par) {\n                if (seen[child] == true) return cycle;   // this condition is for when we are traversing and we meet a node that is already visited -> then we have a cycle? But note: the parent is excluded.\n\n                Then we set seen[child] to true.\n\n                Then for each neighbor i of child:\n                    if i is not the parent, then:\n                        count++ (this is the instance variable) -> which is reset at the beginning of each connected component.\n                        then if the DFS from i (with parent child) returns cycle, then return cycle.\n\n                return path.\n\n            This DFS does:\n\n                It traverses the graph. The count is incremented for every edge that is traversed (except the one that leads to the parent). \n\n                Why does it return cycle when it sees a visited node? Actually, if we are going to a node that is visited and not the parent, then we have a cycle? But the original condition is: if (seen[child]) then return cycle. However, the first time we see a node, we mark it. Then we go to its neighbors. Then if we see a neighbor that is already visited and not the parent, then we return cycle.\n\n                But note: the DFS is called with a parent. So when we go from u to v, and then at v we see u as the parent so we skip u. Then if we see a node w (adjacent to v) that is visited and w is not the parent (which is u) then we have a cycle.\n\n            How to do in C?\n\n            We'll write:\n\n                int cycle = 1;\n                int path = 0;\n\n                int dfs(int child, int par, int** graph, int* deg, char* seen, int* count) {\n                    if (seen[child]) {\n                        return cycle;\n                    }\n                    seen[child] = 1;\n                    for (int j=0; j<deg[child]; j++) {\n                        int i = graph[child][j];\n                        if (i == par) continue;\n                        (*count)++; // increment the count by one (this is the edge from child to i)\n                        if (dfs(i, child, graph, deg, seen, count) == cycle) {\n                            return cycle;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    return path;\n                }\n\n            But note: the condition at the beginning: if we are entering a node that is already seen, then we return cycle. However, the first call to a node that is not seen should not hit that? Actually, the first call: the node is not seen. Then we mark it. Then we traverse its neighbors.\n\n            However, if we traverse to a neighbor that is already visited (and that neighbor is not the parent) then we get a cycle.\n\n            But wait: the DFS function is called recursively. When we are at a node that has been visited, we return cycle. Then the caller (which is the parent of the node that caused the cycle) will return cycle, and so on.\n\n            Then, after DFS returns, the original program checks:\n\n                if (ft.dfs(i,0) == ft.cycle) {\n                    if (ft.count % 2 == 1) toremove++;\n                }\n\n            So if we have a cycle and the total number of edges traversed in the DFS (which is stored in count) is odd, then we increment toremove.\n\n            However, note: the count is incremented by the number of edges traversed? Actually, the DFS traverses the entire connected component? But note: when we find a cycle, we return immediately? Actually, no: the DFS does not stop the traversal? It only stops the recursion when it finds a cycle? But the condition:\n\n                if (dfs(i, child) == cycle) return cycle;\n\n            So as soon as we find a cycle in one of the branches, we return cycle. We don't traverse the entire component? This is a bug? Or the graph is a tree? Actually, the graph might have multiple cycles? But the DFS will stop at the first cycle it finds? And then the entire DFS returns without traversing the rest? \n\n            But the problem: we are counting the number of edges in the entire DFS tree? Actually, the count is incremented for every edge that is traversed (that is not the parent edge). However, if we break early, then we don't traverse all edges? \n\n            How can we count the entire component then? \n\n            Actually, the original program does not break the loop when it gets a cycle? It breaks the recursion? But the DFS function returns cycle, so the entire DFS stops? \n\n            But the problem: we are only interested in the cycle? And then we use the count (which is the number of edges traversed until we found the cycle) to determine if the cycle is odd? \n\n            However, the count is the total number of edges in the DFS tree? Actually, no: because we break as soon as we find a cycle. So the count is the number of edges from the root to the cycle? \n\n            This seems incorrect.\n\n            Let me read the problem of the first code: \n\n            The problem: \n                There are m students and n edges (meaning they are rivals). We want to split into two teams. The rule: rivals must be in different teams. Also, the teams must be of equal size? \n\n                The problem: we are to remove the minimum number of students so that the rest can be split into two teams of equal size? \n\n            Actually, the original problem: \n                http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/216/B\n\n            But without the problem statement, we rely on the code.\n\n            The code does:\n\n                for each connected component:\n                    reset count to 0.\n                    if the DFS returns cycle (meaning the component has a cycle) and the count (which is the number of edges traversed? but note: the DFS stops at the first cycle) is odd, then toremove++.\n\n                Then if (m - toremove) is odd, then toremove++.\n\n            And then output toremove.\n\n            How the DFS works:\n\n                It starts at a node. Then for each neighbor (that is not the parent), it increments count (which counts the edges) and then recursively calls. If the recursive call returns cycle, then it returns cycle.\n\n            But when does it return cycle? When it meets a visited node? Then that visited node is not the parent? \n\n            Actually, the DFS:\n\n                if (seen[child]) -> then we have a cycle? But the child is the current node? And we are just starting? So no.\n\n                Then we mark the node as seen.\n\n                Then for each neighbor i:\n\n                    if i==par, skip.\n\n                    else: \n                         count++   -> this counts the edge (child->i)\n                         then call dfs(i, child)\n\n                         if that returns cycle, then we return cycle.\n\n                Then we return path.\n\n            So the DFS returns cycle only when it finds a back edge that leads to a cycle? \n\n            However, note: the DFS might traverse a tree and then not find a cycle? Then it returns path.\n\n            And what about the count? The count is the number of edges in the DFS tree? Actually, the entire DFS tree? But if we break at the first cycle, then we don't traverse the entire component? \n\n            The original code does not break the loop when one branch returns cycle? It breaks the entire DFS? \n\n            Actually, the code:\n\n                if (dfs(i, child) == cycle) return cycle;\n\n            So if one branch returns cycle, then we break the entire DFS and return cycle. We do not traverse the other branches.\n\n            Therefore, the count is the number of edges from the root to the cycle? Not the entire component.\n\n            This does not make sense for the problem.\n\n            But let me check the original problem: \n\n                \"Forming the Teams\"\n\n                The problem: we have an undirected graph. We want to color the nodes red and blue such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. And we want the two teams to have the same number of students. We can remove some students to achieve that.\n\n                The solution: \n                  - If the entire graph is bipartite, then we can split without removal. Then if the total number of students is even, then we don't remove any. If odd, then we remove one?\n                  - But the problem says: we must remove the minimum number so that the rest can be split and the two teams have equal size.\n\n                Actually, the problem: \n                  \"The students of the Olympiad participated in tennis. They are to be divided into two teams: red and blue. However, not every pair of students can be assigned to the same team if they are rivals. The rivalry is mutual. It is known that the rivalry graph is a set of disjoint cycles and chains. The teams must have the same number of students. How many students must be removed at minimum?\"\n\n                The solution: \n                  - For a tree (which is bipartite), we can always color it. The two colors will be of sizes a and b (a+b = n). Then we can remove |a-b|? But wait, the problem requires the two teams to be of equal size. So we have to remove the entire tree? \n\n                Actually, the known solution for the problem:\n\n                  For each connected component:\n                    if the component is a tree (bipartite and acyclic) then the two colors will be of sizes a and b. Then the entire component can be kept? But then the total size of the two teams would be a and b? Then the entire graph must have an even number of students? \n\n                  However, the known solution: \n                    - For a cycle of even length, it can be split equally. For odd length, we must remove one student.\n                    - For a tree, we can split arbitrarily? But the two colors are fixed. The tree is bipartite. The two parts are fixed. Then the difference is |a-b|. But we can remove some students? Actually, the problem: we can remove arbitrarily? Then we can remove the entire component? \n\n                But the problem says: we want the entire graph to be split into two teams of equal size. \n\n                The known solution: \n                    - Count the number of connected components that have an odd cycle? and then if the total number of students after removal is even? \n\n                The code in the first program:\n\n                    for each connected component:\n                        if it is cyclic? (the DFS returns cycle) and the count (which is the number of edges in the DFS tree until the cycle? but note: the entire DFS is not traversed) is odd -> then we remove one student? \n\n                    Then if (m - toremove) is odd, we remove one more.\n\n                But what is the count? The DFS stops at the first cycle. The count is the number of edges from the root to the cycle? \n\n                Actually, the DFS does:\n\n                    We start at node i (parent 0). Then we traverse an edge to a neighbor, then that neighbor, then ... until we hit a node that we've seen? Then we break.\n\n                The count is the number of edges traversed? \n\n                And then we check if that count is odd? \n\n                But that count is the length of the path from the root to the cycle? \n\n                How is that related to the cycle being odd? \n\n            After reading the problem: \n\n                The known solution: \n                  - The graph is disjoint cycles and chains? Actually, the problem says: \"It is known that the rivalry graph is a set of disjoint cycles and chains.\".\n\n                So the graph is a forest of trees and cycles? But trees are chains? \n\n                The solution: \n                  For each cycle of odd length, we must remove one student (because we can split an even cycle, but an odd cycle would require the same color for adjacent nodes? Actually, no: a cycle of odd length is not bipartite? But wait, the problem says: we can remove some students so that the rest can be split? \n\n                Actually, the problem: \n                  \"The rivalry relation is symmetric and not reflexive. It is known that the rivalry graph is a set of disjoint cycles and chains.\"\n\n                And the solution: \n                  - For a chain (tree with no cycle) we can split arbitrarily? \n                  - For a cycle: if the cycle is even, we can split. If odd, then we must remove one node to break the cycle? \n\n                Then the answer: \n                  toremove = number of odd cycles? \n                  and then if (m - toremove) is odd, we must remove one more? \n\n                Why one more? Because we need the total number of students to be even? \n\n                So the code:\n\n                    for each connected component:\n                         if the component has a cycle (so it's a cycle, not a chain) and the cycle is odd? -> then toremove++\n\n                    Then if (m - toremove) is odd, then toremove++\n\n                How to check if the cycle is odd? \n\n                Actually, the DFS: \n                  We traverse until we find a cycle. The count is the number of edges from the root to the node that we see again? Then the length of the cycle would be (count - the depth of the node we met)? \n\n                But the code does not compute the entire cycle length. Instead, it uses the entire count? \n\n            After reading the original solution: \n                The known solution for the problem: \n                  For each connected component, if the number of edges is odd, then we must remove one student? \n\n                Why? \n                  Because the entire graph must be bipartite? Actually, the problem: the graph is already a set of disjoint cycles and chains. \n                  For a chain: the number of edges is n-1 (which is even if n is odd, odd if n is even? no: 1 edge: n=2 -> even? no, 1 is odd). \n\n                Actually, the problem requires that the two teams have the same number of players. The total number of players must be even. \n\n                We can remove players arbitrarily. But we want to remove as few as possible.\n\n                The solution: \n                  - If the entire graph has an even number of nodes, then we can assign the bipartition? But wait: the graph might not be bipartite? It has cycles? \n\n                But the problem says: the graph is a set of disjoint cycles and chains. Chains are bipartite. Cycles of even length are bipartite. Cycles of odd length are not? Actually, cycles of odd length are bipartite? No: they are not. \n\n                Actually, a cycle of odd length is not bipartite. But the problem does not require a valid bipartition? It requires that no two rivals are in the same team. \n\n                So the graph is bipartite only if there is no odd cycle. \n\n                Therefore, for an odd cycle, we must remove one node to break the cycle? Then the rest becomes a chain? which is bipartite.\n\n                Then the entire graph becomes bipartite. Then we can assign two colors. But then the two colors might not be of equal size? \n\n                The problem requires: \n                  - The two teams must have the same number of players.\n\n                So after removal, the total number of players must be even? \n\n                Steps:\n                  - Remove one player from each odd cycle -> cost: number of odd cycles.\n                  - Then the entire graph is bipartite. Then we can assign colors. But the total number of players is m - toremove. \n                  - If that number is odd, then we must remove one more player (any one) to make it even.\n\n                Therefore, the answer: toremove = number of odd cycles + (if (m - toremove) is odd then 1 else 0)\n\n                How to count the number of odd cycles? \n                  - The number of edges in a cycle is the length of the cycle? \n                  - For a cycle component, the number of edges equals the number of nodes.\n\n                But the DFS counts the edges traversed? And it stops at the first cycle? \n\n                Actually, the DFS will traverse the entire component if there is no cycle? But if there is a cycle, it stops as soon as it finds one? \n\n                How can we know if the cycle is odd? \n\n                The known solution: \n                  In a DFS tree, when we find a back edge, the cycle length is (depth[u] - depth[v] + 1). And we can check if that is odd.\n\n                But the code does not do that. \n\n                The code simply checks: if the entire count (which is the number of edges traversed in the DFS tree until the cycle is found) is odd? \n\n                What is the relation? \n\n                Actually, the count is the number of edges from the root to the node that closes the cycle? That doesn't give the cycle length.\n\n            Given the complexity and the fact that the problem is known, we trust the code: \n                if (ft.dfs(i,0) == ft.cycle) {\n                    if (ft.count % 2 == 1) toremove++;\n                }\n\n            So we'll implement the DFS as in the original.\n\n   Now, after the first program, we get toremove.\n\n   Then we pass toremove to the second program.\n\n   Second program (atcoder_ABC114_C): \n        It counts the numbers that are <= N and are made only of digits '3','5','7' and contain all three digits.\n\n        The main loop:\n\n            long i = 357;\n            int c = 0;\n            while (i <= N) {\n                String s = String.valueOf(i);\n                if (s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\")) c++;\n                // Then compute the next number: \n                //   It's not simply i++: it generates the next number that is composed of 3,5,7.\n\n                // How it generates:\n                //   It starts from the least significant digit:\n                //      if the digit is '3', then change to '5'\n                //      if '5', change to '7'\n                //      if '7', change to '3' and carry over? Actually, it sets a flag and then leaves the rest unchanged? \n\n                // Actually, it does:\n                //   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                //   boolean f = false;\n                //   for each digit from least significant to most:\n                //        char a = the digit.\n                //        if f (which means we have carried over) then we just append the same digit? \n                //        else:\n                //            if a=='3', then change to '5', and set f=true (so no carry)\n                //            if a=='5', then change to '7', and set f=true.\n                //            if a=='7', then change to '3', and then we don't set f? meaning we carry to the next digit.\n\n                //   Then if we never set f (meaning we carried all the way), then we append a '3' at the most significant.\n\n                //   Then reverse the string and parse to long.\n\n                // Example: \n                //   i=3: -> becomes 5? but the program starts at 357.\n                //   i=357: \n                //        s=\"357\"\n                //        reverse: '7','5','3' -> \n                //          j=0: a='7' -> becomes '3', f remains false -> then we continue.\n                //          j=1: a='5' -> becomes '7', f=true -> then break? Actually, the loop continues? But then the rest are appended without change? \n                //          But the code: after changing, we set f=true and break out of the condition? Then the rest are appended unchanged? \n\n                //        Actually, the code: \n                //          for (int j=0; j<s.length(); j++) {\n                //              char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j);\n                //              if (f) {\n                //                  sb.append(a);\n                //              } else {\n                //                  if (a=='3') {\n                //                      sb.append('5'); \n                //                      f = true;\n                //                  } else if (a=='5') {\n                //                      sb.append('7');\n                //                      f = true;\n                //                  } else { // a=='7'\n                //                      sb.append('3');\n                //                  }\n                //              }\n                //          }\n                //        Then if not f, then append '3' at the end? and then reverse.\n\n                //        For 357: \n                //          j=0: a='7' -> else branch: append '3' -> then we haven't set f, so we move to next.\n                //          j=1: a='5' -> else branch: change to '7', set f=true -> then for the rest (if any) we use the if(f) branch.\n                //          j=2: a='3' -> then in the if(f) branch, we append '3'? \n                //          Then we get the string: from least to most: '3','7','3' -> then reverse to '3','7','3' -> 373.\n\n                //        But the next number after 357 should be 373? \n\n            We will refactor this program to a function that takes an integer N and returns c.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                long i = 357;\n                int c = 0;\n                while (i <= N) {\n                    // convert i to string\n                    // if the string contains '3','5','7' (all of them) then c++\n\n                    // then generate next number:\n\n                    //   We'll convert i to a string s.\n                    //   Then create a temporary string for the next number, built from least significant digit to most.\n                    //   We'll use a flag carried = 0 (false).\n                    //   For each digit in s from last to first:\n                    //        if carried: then we leave the digit unchanged.\n                    //        else:\n                    //            if digit is '3': then change to '5', carried=1.\n                    //            if digit is '5': then change to '7', carried=1.\n                    //            if digit is '7': then change to '3', carried remains 0 (so we will carry to the next digit).\n                    //   If after processing all digits, carried is still 0, then we append a '3' at the end (which becomes the most significant after reversal).\n\n                    //   Then reverse the string and parse to long.\n\n                    //   Then set i to that long.\n\n                }\n\n            We'll implement that in C.\n\n   Third program: \n        It takes a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If it does, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        We'll write a function: \n            const char* third_program(const char* s) {\n                int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n                for (int i=0; s[i]!='\\0'; i++) {\n                    if (s[i]=='A') foundA=1;\n                    if (s[i]=='B') foundB=1;\n                }\n                if (foundA && foundB) \n                    return \"Yes\";\n                else\n                    return \"No\";\n            }\n\n        But note: the original third program is atcoder_ABC158_A. The problem: \n            \"There are two stations A and B. You are given a string of three characters, each being 'A' or 'B'. The string represents the stations along a line.

Actually, we built from least to most.\n                // So we need to reverse to get the most significant first.\n                for (int j=0; j<new_len/2; j++) {\n                    char t = temp[j];\n                    temp[j] = temp[new_len-1-j];\n                    temp[new_len-1-j] = t;\n                }\n                temp[new_len] = '\\0';\n                i = atol(temp);\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n\n   Note: the next number generation in the original program did not reverse the entire string? It reversed the StringBuilder? \n\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        ... // we built the new number in sb, but we built the least significant digit first? \n        Then we reversed the entire sb to get the next number.\n\n        In our C code, we built the new number in `temp` from the least significant digit (first in the array) to the most significant (last in the array). Then we reversed to get the usual order.\n\n   But the original also reversed? \n\n        StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n        i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\n   So we are doing the same.\n\n   However, note: the original program did not reverse the entire string after the loop? \n\n        We did:\n\n            We built the string for the next number in `temp` (without the reversal) in the order: \n                index0: the least significant digit, index1: next, ... index_{new_len-1}: the most significant digit.\n\n            Then we reversed the entire `temp` array to get the usual order (most significant first).\n\n        Then we parse it.\n\n   But the original:\n\n        They built the string in a StringBuilder by appending from least significant to most? Then they reversed the entire StringBuilder to get the most significant first.\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n   Now, the third_program function:\n\n        const char* third_program(const char* s) {\n            int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n            for (int i=0; s[i]!='\\0'; i++) {\n                if (s[i]=='A') foundA=1;\n                if (s[i]=='B') foundB=1;\n            }\n            if (foundA && foundB) {\n                return \"Yes\";\n            } else {\n                return \"No\";\n            }\n        }\n\n   However, note: the third program in the original: \n        It checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n   But the string we pass is the integer string from the second program. It contains only digits. So it will never contain 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, it will always return \"No\".\n\n   But that's the chain.\n\n   Let's test with a small input for the first program:\n\n        Input for the first program: \n            3 0   // m=3, n=0 (no edges)\n\n        Then the first program: \n            The graph has 3 nodes and no edges.\n\n            For each connected component (three components, each of one node):\n                DFS: \n                   node1: \n                         seen[1]=false -> do DFS(1,0)\n                         in DFS: \n                             seen[1] becomes true.\n                             then for each neighbor? none -> returns path (0).\n                         so skip the if (cycle) block.\n\n                Then toremove remains 0.\n                Then if (3-0) %2==1 -> then toremove++ -> toremove=1.\n\n            So output of first program: 1.\n\n        Then second_program(1): \n            i=357 -> 357>1 -> so the loop doesn't run -> c=0.\n\n        Then third_program(\"0\") -> does it contain 'A' and 'B'? no -> returns \"No\".\n\n        So the output is \"No\".\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Now, we must be cautious: the DFS might cause stack overflow? The first program uses recursion and the graph can be large? \n\n        The constraints of the problem: \n            m and n: not given. We assume they are not too large.\n\n        But to be safe, we note that the graph is a set of disjoint chains and cycles? So the depth of recursion is the length of the chain? which can be up to m.\n\n        We can use an iterative DFS? But the problem doesn't specify constraints.\n\n        We'll do recursion. For the sake of the problem, we assume m is moderate.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Memory freeing: we are in main, and the program will exit. So we don't have to free, but it's good practice.\n\n   However, we skip freeing for brevity.\n\n   Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n   Note: the first program uses 1-indexed nodes. We assume the input nodes are from 1 to m.\n\n   We'll include necessary headers.\n\n   Summary of the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        // DFS function for the first program\n        int dfs(int child, int par, int** graph, int* deg, char* seen, int* count, int cycle, int path) {\n            if (seen[child]) {\n                return cycle;\n            }\n            seen[child] = 1;\n            for (int j = 0; j < deg[child]; j++) {\n                int i = graph[child][j];\n                if (i == par) continue;\n                (*count)++;\n                if (dfs(i, child, graph, deg, seen, count, cycle, path) == cycle) {\n                    return cycle;\n                }\n            }\n            return path;\n        }\n\n        // Second program: counting numbers\n        int second_program(int N) {\n            if (N < 357) {\n                return 0;\n            }\n            long i = 357;\n            int c = 0;\n            // We'll use a buffer for the string representation.\n            char s[20];\n            char temp[20];\n            while (i <= (long)N) {\n                sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n                int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n                for (int idx=0; s[idx]!='\\0'; idx++) {\n                    if (s[idx]=='3') has3=1;\n                    else if (s[idx]=='5') has5=1;\n                    else if (s[idx]=='7') has7=1;\n                }\n                if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n                int len = strlen(s);\n                int carried = 0;\n                int new_len = len;\n                // We'll build the next number in the temporary array `temp` in reverse order: from least to most.\n                for (int idx=0; idx<len; idx++) {\n                    char ch = s[len-1-idx]; // from last char to first\n                    if (carried) {\n                        temp[idx] = ch;\n                    } else {\n                        if (ch=='3') {\n                            temp[idx] = '5';\n                            carried = 1;\n                        } else if (ch=='5') {\n                            temp[idx] = '7';\n                            carried = 1;\n                        } else if (ch=='7') {\n                            temp[idx] = '3';\n                            // carried remains 0\n                        } else {\n                            // This should not happen?

We assume m>=1.\n\n   We assume the input is valid.\n\n   This is a long program. We hope it works.\n\n   Note: the second program might have an infinite loop if the next number generation fails? But the numbers are increasing? \n\n        The next number generation: \n           357 -> 373 -> 375 -> 377 -> 533 -> ... \n\n        But note: if the number becomes larger than the maximum long? But the input to the second program is toremove (which is at most m, and m is the input which is an integer). So toremove is at most a few hundred? Then the numbers generated in the second program start at 357 and go up, but toremove is small so the loop will run only a few times.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   We output the entire C program."
