Actually, it checks if the Manhattan distance is 1? Specifically: \n          (dx<=1 && dy==0) -> horizontal adjacent? (dy<=1 && dx==0) -> vertical adjacent? But what about diagonally adjacent? The condition does not cover (dx=1 and dy=1). The condition: \n          if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0)) This is equivalent to: \n          (dx==0 && dy==0) -> same point?

And we precompute valid[256] for the last4. We must be cautious: the state for the second program: \n        state s: 0..63 -> 64 states. The valid array: 256 elements. The DP array: [0..100] x [0..63] -> 101*64 = 6464 entries. We'll do:\n\n      long dp[101][64];   // dp[i][s] for i in [0, N] and s in [0,63]\n\n      Precompute valid[256] as described.

  // read the first program's input\n\n        char* S1 = decode_first_program(input);\n        int N = atoi(S1);\n        free(S1);\n\n        long result = run_second_program(N);\n        char result_str[50];\n        sprintf(result_str, \"%ld\", result);\n\n        run_third_program(result_str);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nBut note: what if the first program's output string is empty? Then atoi returns 0. Then run_second_program(0) returns 1? Because: \n      dp[0][63] = 1? But for N=0: \n          We have: \n            for s: dp[0][s] = 0? Actually: \n            We set for i from N-1 down to 0: but N=0, so we skip the loop. Then we return dp[0][63] which is uninitialized? We must initialize dp for N=0. How does the second program work for N=0? The Java program: \n          current=0, last3=\"TTT\"\n          if current==0 (which is N=0) -> return 1. So we should set: \n          if N==0, then we return 1? But our dp: \n          We set for i=N (which is 0): \n              for s in 0..63: dp[0][s] = 1   (because we set dp[N][s]=1 for all s, and N=0). Then we return dp[0][63] which is 1. But then we run the loop for i from N-1 down to 0: which is from -1 down to 0 -> we skip. So it works. However, note: the state at i=0 is set to 1 for all s? But we only care about state=63? Actually, the base case: \n        dp[N][s] = 1 for all s -> that's the base case (at the end of the sequence, regardless of the state, there is 1 way). Then we work backwards. For N=0, we do nothing in the loop and return dp[0][63] which was set to 1. So it's correct. But note: the valid array and the state representation: we assume that the state is represented as a base4 number of 3 digits. For the initial state \"TTT\", we use 63. However, when N=0, we never use the valid array? So the program should work. But note: the third program: if the second program returns 1, then the string is \"1\". The third program will see:\n        k=0: (0,0)\n        then for each char in \"1\": \n            it's not L,R,U,D -> no move -> then k=1: (0,0)\n\n        Then k=2: (0,0) [because the string \"1\" has one character, so k=0 and k=1?] Actually: \n            k=0: (0,0) -> then we process the first char: \n                no move -> then k=1: (0,0) So k=2 points? Then we check: i from 0 to k-3 = 0 to 2-3 -> 0 to -1 -> skip the outer loop -> flag remains true -> output \"OK\". But wait: k=2, then k-3 = -1 -> the outer loop: i from 0 to k-3 (which is -1) -> condition: 0 <= -1 is false -> skip. Then output \"OK\". However, the Java program for the third program would have:\n\n        k = 0: (0,0) -> then we process the string of length 1: \n            then k becomes 1: (0,0) -> then k becomes 2: (0,0) -> no, wait:\n\n        The Java program:\n\n            k=0: (0,0) -> then for i=0 to s.length()-1:\n                switch(ch[i]) -> which is '1': no move? then set co[0][k]=x (0), co[1][k]=y (0) -> k=1. Then the array of points: \n                index0: (0,0) [k=0]\n                index1: (0,0) [k=1]\n\n            Then k=2? Actually, k is incremented to 1 at the end of the loop? Then the loop: \n                for i=0 to k-3: k=2 -> k-3 = -1 -> no loop. Then output \"OK\". But our third program: \n        k=0: (0,0) -> then we process the string: \n            for i=0 to len-1 (len=1) -> we do:\n                x=0, y=0 -> then we set x_coords[1]=0, y_coords[1]=0 -> k=2. Then we have two points: index0: (0,0) and index1: (0,0). Then k=2. Then we check: \n                for i from 0 to k-3 = 0 to 2-3 = -1 -> skip. Then output \"OK\". So it matches. However, note: the third program in the original Java has:\n\n        k=0: (x,y) = (0,0) -> stored at index0 -> then k=1. Then for each move, we update x,y and then store at k and then k++. So the number of points is k = (number of moves) + 1. In the Java program: \n            k = 0 initially, then after storing the start, k=1. Then for each character, we update and then store at k and then k++. So at the end, k = s.length()+1. We do the same. Therefore, the program is complete. We must note: the second program might have an integer overflow? We use mod. Let's test with N=0: result = 1 -> string \"1\" -> third program: outputs \"OK\"\n\n  With N=1: \n        We'll compute: \n            dp[1][s] for all s: set to 1. then for i=0: \n                s=63, then for b in 0..3:\n                    last4_index = 63*4 + b = 252+b -> we need to check valid[252+b] for b in {0,1,2,3}\n\n        How to compute valid for state 63 (which is \"TTT\") and then base b: \n            The last4 = \"TTT\" + base (one of 'A','C','G','T') -> so \"TTTA\", \"TTTC\", \"TTTG\", \"TTTT\"\n\n        Check \"TTTA\": \n            Does it contain \"AGC\"? -> no. Check swaps:\n                swap0: swap first and second -> \"TTTA\" -> becomes \"TTTA\" (same) -> no \"AGC\"\n                swap1: swap second and third -> \"TTTA\" becomes \"TTTA\" -> same? \n                swap2: swap third and fourth: \"TTTA\" becomes \"TTAT\"\n\n            Now, \"TTAT\" does not contain \"AGC\", so valid. Similarly, we can check the others. Actually, we need to check for each base. So the state 0 (i=0) with state s=63: \n            for each base, the last4 is \"TTT\"+base, and all are valid? Then we add 4 * 1 = 4. So dp[0][63] = 4. Then the result for N=1 is 4. Then the third program: \n            input string = \"4\" (one character) Then the path: \n                k0: (0,0)\n                k1: (0,0)   [because the character '4' is not a move]\n            Then we have two points: (0,0) and (0,0). Then check: \n                i=0, j from i+3=3 to k-1=1 -> j=3 is beyond k-1=1 -> skip. So flag=true -> output \"OK\" So the program outputs \"OK\" for N=1. We'll write the entire code accordingly. Note: the third program might get a large string? The second program's result can be up to 4^N mod 1000000007, which for N=100 is about 4^100 mod 1000000007 -> but 4^100 is a 60-digit number?

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs together. The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (codeforces_32_B) reads a string and outputs a string (without spaces, just a sequence of '0','1','2').\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC122_D) reads an integer N (from standard input) and outputs a long integer (mod 1000000007).\nThe third program (codeforces_8_B) reads a string (a sequence of characters 'L','R','U','D').\n\nBut the output of the first program is a string of digits, which is then fed as input to the second program. However, the second program expects an integer. \nThis mismatch suggests that the original chain might not be intended to be connected? \n\nLooking at the programs:\n\nProgram 1: Takes a string of '.' and '-' (which is the Morse-like code) and decodes it to a string of digits (0,1,2). \nProgram 2: Takes an integer N and computes the number of DNA sequences of length N that do not contain \"AGC\" and also avoid some adjacent swaps that would lead to \"AGC\". \nProgram 3: Takes a string of moves (L, R, U, D) and checks if the path has a \"BUG\" (two points that are adjacent in the grid but not consecutive in the path, which would indicate crossing).\n\nBut note: the output of program1 is a string of digits (e.g., \"01201\"), and program2 expects an integer. \nWe cannot chain them directly unless we interpret the string of digits as a number? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nBut the second program (atcoder_ABC122_D) reads an integer. So the string output of the first program must be converted to an integer? \nBut what if the string is too long? The integer might be too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the chain is not as expected? \n\nBut the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nWe must note that the original programs are independent and read from stdin. We are to chain them so that the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nSo:\n\nStep 1: Run the first program on the input string (which is the first program's input) and capture its output (a string of digits). \nStep 2: Use that string of digits as the input to the second program? But the second program reads an integer. \n\nHowever, the second program expects an integer from stdin. So we must convert the output string of the first program to an integer? \n\nBut what if the string is not a valid integer? The first program outputs a string of 0,1,2. It is a base-3 number? Actually, it's just a sequence of digits, but without any separators. \n\nBut note: the second program expects one integer. The entire string of digits would be one big integer. However, the second program uses that integer as N (the length of the DNA sequence). The constraints of the second program: N can be up to 100. \n\nBut the first program's output string might be very long? The input to the first program is a string of '.' and '-' (which is the Morse code). The problem does not specify the length, but the first program's output length is the same as the number of dots and dashes? Actually, no: each dash (represented by '-') is processed as two characters? Actually, the input to the first program is a string of '.' and '-'? \n\nLooking at the first program: \n  It processes a char array. \n  When it sees a '.', it outputs either 0 or 1 (depending on whether it was preceded by a dash that started a pair?).\n  When it sees a '-', it either sets a flag (s=true) or if the flag was set then it outputs 2.\n\nSo the output string has the same number of characters as the number of '.' and the number of dashes that form complete pairs? Actually, each dash that is part of a pair (two dashes) becomes a 2, and a single dash becomes part of a pair with a following dot? \n\nBut note: the first program does not output a number per se, but a string of digits. \n\nGiven that the second program expects an integer N, and the third program expects a string of moves, we must consider:\n\nOption 1: The chain is not as written? But the problem says the entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is intended to be the input to the third program? But the third program expects a string of moves (L,R,U,D) and the first program outputs a string of digits (0,1,2). That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the chain might be:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> (string of digits) -> Program2 (which we must change to read a string and interpret it as an integer? but the string might be too long) -> Program3 (which expects a string of moves, but Program2 outputs a number) -> ?\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" meaning the three programs are run in sequence. \n\nWe must reinterpret the programs to avoid I/O in the middle. \n\nHowever, the inputs and outputs of the programs:\n\nProgram1: \n  Input: a string (from stdin) of '.' and '-'\n  Output: a string of digits (without spaces) to stdout.\n\nProgram2:\n  Input: an integer from stdin (which we get from the output of Program1? but that is a string of digits). So we must convert that string to an integer? \n\nBut what if the string of digits is too long? The second program's N is at most 100. So if the string of digits has more than 100 digits, then the integer would be too big to represent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output of the first program is not intended to be the integer for the second? \n\nLooking at the original Java programs, they are independent and each reads from stdin. So the chain is:\n\n  Original input (for Program1) -> Program1 produces output1.\n  Then, we run Program2: which reads an integer from stdin. But if we chain, then we must feed output1 as the input to Program2. But Program2 expects an integer.\n\nSo we must convert the string (output1) to an integer. However, the problem states that the entire sequence must be reproduced.\n\nBut what if the string output1 is not a valid integer? It only contains digits, so it is a nonnegative integer. But the integer might be too big for an int? The second program uses an int (N) and then does a DFS with memoization for N up to 100. So if the string is too long (more than about 10^100, which is impossible in practice) but also the integer value might be astronomically huge? \n\nAlternatively, note that the second program does not use the entire string of digits as the integer? Actually, the second program only reads one integer. So the entire output of the first program must be that one integer? \n\nBut the first program's output is a string of digits that might be long. How do we use it as input for the second program? \n\nWe have two options:\n\n1. We interpret the entire string of digits as a base-10 number and then use that number as N for the second program. But the second program expects N to be at most 100, so if the string has more than 3 digits (and the number is >100) then the second program will run with a very large N and likely crash (or run forever) because the DFS would be for a depth of that huge N.\n\n2. We consider that the chain is broken? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not as the order of the files? The problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". The order is given as File1, File2, File3.\n\nBut let's look at the third program: it expects a string of moves (L, R, U, D). The output of the second program is a long integer (printed as a number). The third program expects a string. So we would have to convert the long integer to a string? and then the third program would process that string? \n\nBut the third program expects the string to be composed of the letters 'L','R','U','D'. The second program outputs a string of digits (if we convert the long to a string). So the third program would see a string of digits and then process them? \n\nBut the third program's logic: it moves according to the characters. It would see a digit and then do nothing because the switch statement only handles 'L','R','U','D'. So the third program would not move at all? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nGiven the confusion, I suspect that the chain might be:\n\n  Input for the entire system is the input for the first program (a string of '.' and '-').\n\n  Then the first program outputs a string of digits (say S).\n\n  Then the second program is run with input = the length of S? Or the first program's output is the input for the third program? \n\nBut the problem says \"the entire sequence\", meaning the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the programs are independent and the chain is not by data but by the problem context? \n\nBut the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAfter re-examining, I notice that the programs are from different sources (codeforces, atcoder) and likely independent. Therefore, the chain might be an artificial one for this problem. \n\nWe are forced to connect them as:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial input (a string) for the first program.\n  Step 2: Run the first program's logic on that string, producing a string S (of digits).\n  Step 3: Use the string S to extract an integer for the second program? But how? \n\nBut the second program expects a single integer. The only integer we have from the first program is the length of the output? Or the value of the output string? \n\nThe problem does not specify. \n\nAlternatively, the second program is independent of the first? But the problem says they are executed in sequence.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we must rely on the intended behavior:\n\nThe problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\nBut the original chain would be:\n\n  $ java codeforces_32_B <<< \"input1\"\n  ... outputs a string S\n  $ java atcoder_ABC122_D <<< \"S\"   # but S is a string, and the program reads an integer -> this would throw an exception.\n\nSo the original chain would not work? \n\nUnless the first program's output is an integer? But the first program outputs a string of digits that might be more than one digit.\n\nAlternatively, the second program might be reading the entire string and then parsing it as an integer? But the second program uses `nextInt()`, which reads the next integer token. So if the string S is \"123\", then the second program would read 123. But if the string S is \"12\\n\", then it would read 12. But the first program does not output a newline? It uses `System.out.print` without any newline. So the entire output is a single line.\n\nBut what if the output of the first program is \"12345678901234567890\", which is too big for an int? The second program uses `nextInt()`, which would fail for numbers too big.\n\nGiven that the second program's N is at most 100 in the problem it comes from (atcoder ABC122 D), we must assume that the output of the first program is a string that represents a small integer (<=100). \n\nTherefore, we can convert the string produced by the first program to an integer. If the string is empty, we use 0? \n\nSimilarly, the output of the second program is a long integer (which we then convert to a string) and feed to the third program. \n\nBut the third program expects a string of moves (only L, R, U, D). The second program outputs a decimal representation of a long. The third program would then process each digit as a character? \n\nBut the third program's switch statement:\n\n  switch (ch[i]) {\n      case 'L': ... break;\n      case 'R': ... break;\n      case 'U': ... break;\n      case 'D': ... break;\n  }\n\nSo if the character is '1', it would do nothing? So the path would be the starting point (0,0) and then for each digit, no move? \n\nThis would result in the path being a single point (0,0) repeated for the length of the string? \n\nThen the third program would check: for each i, the point (0,0) and then at j=i+3, also (0,0). The distance between (0,0) and (0,0) is 0, so the condition:\n\n  if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0))\n\nis true (dx=0, dy=0 -> 0<=1 and 0==0). Then it would set flag to false.\n\nSo the third program would output \"BUG\".\n\nBut this is not the intended behavior of the third program? \n\nGiven the confusion, I suspect that the chain might be intended as:\n\n  Input for the entire system is the input for the first program (a string of '.' and '-').\n  The first program decodes it to a string of digits (say S1).\n  Then the second program is run with input = the length of S1? \n\nBut the second program's problem (atcoder_ABC122_D) is about DNA sequences of length N. The length of the first program's output is the length of the decoded string.\n\nAlternatively, the integer for the second program is the length of the first program's output.\n\nBut the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second. \n\nIf we take the length, that is not the output of the first program, but a derivative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a mistake.\n\nGiven the instructions, we must strictly use the output of the first as the input to the second, and the output of the second as the input to the third.\n\nSo:\n\n  First program: input = a string (from stdin) of '.' and '-', output = a string S (of digits) to stdout.\n  Second program: input = the string S (from stdin) but it uses `nextInt()`, so we must convert the entire string S to an integer. If the string is too long, we might get an overflow. But the problem states that the chain must behave identically. \n\nIn the original chain, if we run the second program with the string S as input, it would throw an exception if S is not a single integer token and if the integer is out of range. \n\nSo in our C program, we must do:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial string (for the first program) from stdin.\n  Step 2: Process it to get string S (as the first program does).\n  Step 3: Convert the entire string S to an integer. But if the string is too long or not a valid integer, we must mimic the Java program's behavior? \n\nBut the second program uses `nextInt()`, which will throw an exception if the input is not an integer. So if the string S has non-digit characters? It doesn't because the first program outputs only '0','1','2'. So it is a nonnegative integer.\n\nBut the second program's `nextInt()` will read the next token (and the entire string S is one token). However, the integer might be too big for an int. In Java, `nextInt()` will throw an InputMismatchException if the integer is out of the range of int.\n\nIn C, we don't have exceptions. We must decide: \n\n  If the string S is too long (more than 10 digits, or the number is > 2e9) then we cannot represent it as an int. But the second program in Java would throw an exception. \n\nBut the problem says: behaves identically. \n\nHowever, the constraints of the first program: the input is a string of '.' and '-'. The length is arbitrary? \n\nBut the second program is designed for N<=100. So in practice, the first program's output should be a small integer? \n\nBut there is no guarantee. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, we must assume that the input to the first program is such that the output string S can be converted to an integer that fits in an int, and that integer is at most 100 (so that the second program runs in reasonable time). \n\nSimilarly, the output of the second program is a long integer. We must convert that long integer to a string (without any spaces) and then feed it as the input to the third program.\n\nThe third program will then process that string of digits as if it were a sequence of moves? But the moves are only on the letters 'L','R','U','D'. So all the digits are not among these, so the third program would not move at all. \n\nTherefore, the path would be:\n\n  Start at (0,0)\n  For each digit in the string (which is the decimal representation of the long integer from the second program), we do:\n      no move because the digit is not L, R, U, or D.\n\n  So the entire path is just (0,0) repeated for the length of the string.\n\nThen the third program would check for any two points that are adjacent in the grid and non-consecutive in the path. But the path is all (0,0). So the condition:\n\n  dx = |0-0| = 0, dy = |0-0|=0 -> then condition: (0<=1 and 0==0) -> true. \n\nSo it would break and output \"BUG\".\n\nBut is this the intended behavior? Probably not.\n\nGiven the mismatch, I suspect that the chain might be:\n\n  First program's output (the string of digits) is the input to the third program? \n\nBut the problem says the entire sequence in the order given.\n\nAlternatively, the programs are not chained by the problem author's intention, but we are forced by the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, we will implement:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial string (for the first program) from stdin.\n  Step 2: Process that string to produce a string S (the decoded string of digits).\n  Step 3: Convert the entire string S to an integer. If it is too big to fit in an int, we set it to 0 (or handle as in Java: but in C we don't have exceptions, so we must decide). However, the problem says the chain must behave identically. Since the Java program would throw an exception and exit, we must mimic that? But the problem does not specify. \n\nAlternatively, we note that the second program is designed for N up to 100, so we can cap N at 100? But that would change the behavior.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the problem might have a mistake, I will assume that the output of the first program is a string that represents an integer in the range [0, 100]. \n\nWhy?\n  The first program's output length is the same as the number of '.' and the number of dashes that were resolved. But the input to the first program is a Morse code for digits: each digit is represented by a sequence of '.' and '-'. The program is decoding it. The original problem (codeforces_32_B) is about decoding a string of '.' and '-' into digits 0,1,2. The example: \n      Input: \".->\"\n      Output: \"01\"\n\n  So the output string's length is the number of digits. And the second program expects an integer N (the length of the DNA sequence), which is at most 100. So the output of the first program, when interpreted as an integer, might be intended to be the length? But the output is a sequence of digits, not the length.\n\n  Example: \n      Input to first program: \".--.\" \n      Decoding: \n          '.' -> output 0 -> then we have a '-' which sets s=true, then next is '-' -> so output 2? Then '.' -> output 1? \n      So the output string is \"021\", which is 3 digits. Then the second program would use 021 as the integer? That is 21.\n\n  But 21 is within 100.\n\n  Alternatively, the output string might be \"10\", which is 10.\n\n  So we convert the entire string to an integer. \n\nBut note: the string might have leading zeros. For example, the output string might be \"0012\", which is 12. \n\nIn Java, `nextInt()` would read 12 if the input is \"0012\"? No, because `nextInt()` uses the next token and skips whitespace. The token for \"0012\" is 12? Actually, no: the token is \"0012\", and `nextInt()` would parse it as 12? \n\nIn Java, `nextInt()` uses the `next` method to get the next token and then parses it with `Integer.parseInt`, which does not allow leading zeros? Actually, it does: `Integer.parseInt(\"0012\")` returns 12. But wait, the token is \"0012\", so `parseInt` returns 12? \n\nBut that is not 0012. The integer 0012 is 12. \n\nSo in C, we can use `atoi` or `strtol` to convert the string to an integer. But note: the string might be too long. We'll use `strtol` to detect overflow.\n\nHowever, the second program uses `int N = in.nextInt();` and then `N` is used as the length. The integer must be nonnegative and at most 100. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  If the string S is empty, then N=0.\n  Else, convert the string S to a long, then check if it is in the range [0,100]. If not, we set N to 0? But the Java program would throw an exception. \n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. We are to mimic the behavior. \n\nSince the problem constraints for the second program are small, we assume the integer is in the valid range.\n\nSimilarly, the output of the second program is a long integer. We must convert it to a string to feed to the third program. \n\nSo the plan:\n\n  1. Read the initial string (from stdin) for the first program. We assume it's one token? The first program uses `in.next()`.\n\n  2. Process the initial string to produce a string S (the first program's output).\n\n  3. Convert S to an integer N for the second program.\n\n  4. Run the second program's logic with N.\n\n  5. Take the result (a long integer) and convert it to a string (in decimal) without any formatting (no spaces, no newline).\n\n  6. Feed that string to the third program's logic.\n\n  7. The third program processes the string of digits (which are not moves) and then outputs either \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nBut note: the third program's logic will see a string of digits and do nothing for each digit (because the switch only handles 'L','R','U','D'). So the path is:\n\n      k = 0: (0,0)\n      then for each digit in the string (say \"123456\"), we have:\n          k=1: (0,0)   [because no move for '1']\n          k=2: (0,0)   [for '2']\n          ... \n\n      So the entire path is (0,0) for every step.\n\n  8. Then the third program checks: for i=0 to k-3, and j from i+3 to k-1, we check the points: \n          (0,0) and (0,0): dx=0, dy=0 -> condition: (0<=1 and 0==0) -> true -> flag becomes false.\n\n  9. Then output \"BUG\".\n\nBut this is not the intended behavior of the third program? \n\nGiven the instructions, we must do exactly that.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  We'll write a single C program that does:\n\n      char* input = read_initial_string();   // from stdin\n\n      // Step 1: first program\n      char* S = decode_first_program(input);   // returns a string (dynamically allocated)\n\n      // Step 2: convert S to integer N\n      int N = atoi(S);   // but note: atoi ignores non-digit and stops at the first non-digit, but our S is all digits. But if S is empty, atoi returns 0.\n      // However, atoi does not detect overflow. But we know N must be small (<=100). \n      // We can also use strtol for error checking? But the problem says the chain must work, so we assume it's in range.\n\n      // Step 3: run the second program's logic with N\n      long result = run_second_program(N);\n\n      // Step 4: convert result to a string\n      char result_str[50]; // enough for a long\n      sprintf(result_str, \"%ld\", result);\n\n      // Step 5: run the third program's logic on the string result_str\n      run_third_program(result_str);\n\n  Then we output whatever the third program outputs.\n\nBut note: the third program outputs either \"OK\" or \"BUG\" (with no newline? actually, it uses println).\n\nWe must output exactly that.\n\nNow, we must write the logic of each program in C.\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\nProgram1: codeforces_32_B\n\n  Input: a string (char array) of '.' and '-'\n  Output: a string (char array) of '0','1','2'\n\n  Logic:\n      s = false (a flag)\n      for each char in the input:\n          if the char is '.':\n              if s is true: then output '1' and set s to false.\n              else: output '0'\n          else (char is '-'):\n              if s is true: then output '2' and set s to false.\n              else: set s to true.\n\n  We must note: the Java program does not output a newline at the end.\n\n  In C, we will produce a null-terminated string.\n\nProgram2: atcoder_ABC122_D\n\n  Input: an integer N (we get from the first program's output string converted to int)\n  Output: a long integer (mod 1000000007)\n\n  We note: the original program uses a recursive DFS with memoization. We must reimplement the same logic.\n\n  The state: (current, last3) \n      current: the current length (from 0 to N)\n      last3: a string of 3 characters (from the last three bases)\n\n  The alphabet: {'A','C','G','T'} -> but in the Java program, the tokens are strings: \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\". We can use characters in C.\n\n  The function isOK(last4): \n      - returns false if last4 contains \"AGC\"\n      - also, for each i in [0,2], swap the characters at i and i+1 to form a new string, and if that new string contains \"AGC\", return false.\n\n  The DFS:\n      if current == N: return 1\n      if memo[current][last3] exists, return it.\n      Otherwise, for each base in \"ACGT\":\n          form new_last3 = last3[1:2] + base\n          if isOK(last3 + base) is true, then add dfs(current+1, new_last3)\n\n      memoize and return.\n\n  We note: the initial last3 is \"TTT\" (as in the Java program).\n\n  We must represent the state: \n      current: 0..N (N<=100, so we can have an array of size 101 for memo)\n      last3: a string of 3 characters. We can represent it as a char[4] (null-terminated) or as an integer? \n\n  But the alphabet has 4 letters. We can map: \n      A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.\n\n  Then the state is (current, a base-4 number of 3 digits) -> 4^3 = 64 states per current. So we can have a 2D array: \n      long memo[101][64];   // but we can index: state = last3[0]*16 + last3[1]*4 + last3[2]\n\n  However, the isOK function requires the string of 4 characters (last3+base). We can build the string from the state? \n\n  Alternatively, we can store the last3 as a string and use a hash table? But the state space is only 64 per current, so we can precompute.\n\n  But the Java program uses a Map per current. We can do the same in C? But we want efficiency.\n\n  Since N is at most 100, we can have an array for the current state (0..100) and for each state (0..63) we store the value.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Precompute a mapping from state index to the three bases? \n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid mapping by having:\n\n          state = (c0, c1, c2) where c0, c1, c2 in {0,1,2,3}\n\n      Then for a new base b (0..3), we form the new state = (c1, c2, b) and the string for isOK is the string of the old state (c0, c1, c2) and then b? \n\n      Actually, the last4 is the string of the last three (which is c0, c1, c2) and then the new base b? \n\n      But wait: the state is the last three bases. When we add a new base, we form the new last three = c1, c2, b. But the last four is (c0, c1, c2, b).\n\n      So we need the entire last4? We have the state (c0, c1, c2) and the new base b -> last4 = [c0, c1, c2, b].\n\n      We can precompute a table for isOK for all 4^4=256 possibilities? \n\n      Let's create a table: \n          int isOK[256];   // but we index by a 4-digit base4 number? \n\n      How to represent the last4 as an index: \n          index = c0 * 64 + c1 * 16 + c2 * 4 + b   [but base4: each digit 0..3, and 4 digits: 4^4=256]\n\n      Then we precompute for each index: \n          form the string: \n              char str[5];\n              str[0] = \"ACGT\"[c0];\n              str[1] = \"ACGT\"[c1];\n              str[2] = \"ACGT\"[c2];\n              str[3] = \"ACGT\"[b];\n              str[4] = '\\0';\n          and then check if the string contains \"AGC\"? \n          and also, for i=0 to 2, swap str[i] and str[i+1] and check if the resulting string (of length 4) contains \"AGC\".\n\n      But note: the condition: \n          - if the string contains \"AGC\", then invalid.\n          - for i in [0,2]:\n                swap(str[i], str[i+1]);\n                check if the new string (which is now of length 4) contains \"AGC\"?\n                then swap back.\n\n      However, we can break early.\n\n      We'll precompute a table: valid[state] for state in [0,255] (if the last4 is valid).\n\n  Then the DP state: dp[current][s] for current in [0..N] and s in [0..63] (for the last3).\n\n  The recurrence:\n\n      dp[N][s] = 1 for all s.\n\n      for current from N-1 down to 0:\n          for each state s (last3) in [0,63]:\n              dp[current][s] = 0\n              for each base b in [0,3]:\n                  let last4 = (s0, s1, s2, b) where s0 = s / 16, s1 = (s/4)%4, s2 = s%4? \n                  Actually, if the state s represents (c0, c1, c2), then the last4 is (c0, c1, c2, b). \n                  We can compute the index for last4: \n                      idx = c0 * 64 + c1 * 16 + c2 * 4 + b   -> but wait, that is s*4+b? \n                  But note: s = c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n\n                  Then last4_index = (s * 4 + b)   [since s0*64+s1*16+s2*4+b = (c0*16+c1*4+c2)*4 + b = c0*64 + c1*16 + c2*4 + b]\n\n                  If valid[last4_index] is true, then:\n                      the new state for the next step: s_new = (c1, c2, b) = (c1*4 + c2)*4 + b? \n                      Actually: s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b   ??? \n                      s = c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n                      We want: c1, c2, b -> state_new = c1*16 + c2*4 + b.\n\n                  How to compute: \n                      state_new = (s % (4*4)) * 4 + b   = (s % 16) * 4 + b.\n\n                  Then: \n                      dp[current][s] += dp[current+1][state_new]\n\n  But note: the initial state: \n        The Java program starts with last3 = \"TTT\". \n        T is 3. So state0 = 3*16 + 3*4 + 3 = 3*(16+4+1)=3*21=63? \n\n        Actually: \n            state = c0*16 + c1*4 + c2 = 3*16 + 3*4 + 3 = 48+12+3 = 63.\n\n  Then the answer is dp[0][63].\n\n  However, the DFS in the Java program is from 0 to N. We can do iterative DP from N down to 0? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      dp[N][s] = 1 for all s.\n\n      for current = N-1 down to 0:\n          for s in 0..63:\n              for b in 0..3:\n                  last4_index = s * 4 + b;\n                  if (valid[last4_index]) {\n                      s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b;   // shift: remove the first base, and append b.\n                      dp[current][s] = (dp[current][s] + dp[current+1][s_new]) % MOD;\n                  }\n\n      Then answer = dp[0][63]\n\n  But note: the state at current=0: we have done 0 bases, and we have the last3 as \"TTT\". But actually, we haven't added any base, so why do we have \"TTT\"? The Java program starts with last3 = \"TTT\" at current=0. So we start with that state.\n\n  However, the initial state \"TTT\" is artificial. \n\n  This DP is for a sequence of length N. We start at current=0 (0 bases added) and state=\"TTT\", and then we add one base at a time until we have N bases.\n\n  So the DP is from 0 to N.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      dp[0][63] = 1   (but that's not: at 0 bases, we have no bases, but we have the state \"TTT\", which is the initial context)\n\n      Then for current from 0 to N-1:\n          for each state s:\n              if dp[current][s] > 0:\n                 for each base b:\n                     last4_index = s * 4 + b;\n                     if valid[last4_index]:\n                         s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b;\n                         dp[current+1][s_new] = (dp[current+1][s_new] + dp[current][s]) % MOD;\n\n      Then the answer = sum_{s} dp[N][s]\n\n  But note: the Java program returns 1 at current=N. So the initial state at N is 1 for every state? Actually, no: the Java program returns 1 at current=N regardless of state? \n\n      if (current == N) {\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n      So the base case: for every state at current=N, we have 1.\n\n      Therefore, the iterative DP from N-1 down to 0 is easier.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      long dp[101][64];   // dp[i][s]: number of ways from the state s at current=i to the end (which is N bases)\n\n      for s in 0..63:\n          dp[N][s] = 1;\n\n      for i = N-1; i>=0; i-- {\n          for s in 0..63 {\n              dp[i][s] = 0;\n              for b in 0..3 {\n                  int last4_index = s * 4 + b;\n                  if (valid[last4_index]) {\n                      int s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b;   // shift left by one base and add b at the end.\n                      dp[i][s] = (dp[i][s] + dp[i+1][s_new]) % MOD;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      answer = dp[0][63];\n\n  But note: the state representation: \n        s = c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n        Then to shift: we remove c0, and we have (c1, c2) and then add b.\n        The new state: s_new = c1*16 + c2*4 + b.\n\n        How to compute: \n            s = 16*c0 + 4*c1 + c2.\n            Then (s % 16) = 4*c1 + c2? \n            Then (s % 16) * 4 + b = 4*(4*c1+c2) + b = 16*c1 + 4*c2 + b.\n\n        Which is the state for (c1, c2, b). Correct.\n\n  Precomputation of valid[256]:\n\n      We'll create an array valid[256] (all false initially).\n\n      for c0 in 0..3:\n          for c1 in 0..3:\n              for c2 in 0..3:\n                  for b in 0..3:\n                      int idx = c0*64 + c1*16 + c2*4 + b;\n                      // build the string: \n                      char str[5];\n                      str[0] = \"ACGT\"[c0];\n                      str[1] = \"ACGT\"[c1];\n                      str[2] = \"ACGT\"[c2];\n                      str[3] = \"ACGT\"[b];\n                      str[4] = '\\0';\n                      // Check if the string contains \"AGC\"\n                      if (strstr(str, \"AGC\") != NULL) {\n                          valid[idx] = 0;\n                      } else {\n                          // Check the three swaps: \n                          int ok = 1;\n                          for (int swap_index = 0; swap_index < 3; swap_index++) {\n                              // swap str[swap_index] and str[swap_index+1]\n                              char temp = str[swap_index];\n                              str[swap_index] = str[swap_index+1];\n                              str[swap_index+1] = temp;\n                              if (strstr(str, \"AGC\") != NULL) {\n                                  ok = 0;\n                                  break;\n                              }\n                              // swap back\n                              temp = str[swap_index];\n                              str[swap_index] = str[swap_index+1];\n                              str[swap_index+1] = temp;\n                          }\n                          valid[idx] = ok;\n                      }\n\n  However, we can break early.\n\nProgram3: codeforces_8_B\n\n  Input: a string (the output of the second program: a string of digits, but the program expects moves? but we have digits)\n\n  The program will simulate the moves: \n      x=0, y=0, k=0.\n      record (x,y) at k=0.\n      Then for each character in the string:\n          if the char is 'L': x--\n          if 'R': x++\n          if 'U': y++\n          if 'D': y--\n          and record (x,y) at step k (incrementing k each time).\n\n      Then, it checks for any i and j (with j>=i+3) such that the Euclidean distance? Actually, it checks:\n\n          dx = |x_i - x_j|, dy = |y_i - y_j|\n          if (dx<=1 && dy==0) OR (dy<=1 && dx==0) then flag=false.\n\n      But note: the condition is for adjacent points in the grid? Actually, it checks if the Manhattan distance is 1? \n\n      Specifically: \n          (dx<=1 && dy==0) -> horizontal adjacent? \n          (dy<=1 && dx==0) -> vertical adjacent? \n          But what about diagonally adjacent? The condition does not cover (dx=1 and dy=1). \n\n      The condition: \n          if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0))\n\n      This is equivalent to: \n          (dx==0 && dy==0) -> same point? \n          (dx==1 && dy==0) -> adjacent horizontally\n          (dx==0 && dy==1) -> adjacent vertically.\n\n      But note: the condition also allows (dx=0 and dy=0) which is the same point. \n\n      The problem: if two points (at step i and step j, with j>=i+3) are the same or adjacent (horizontally/vertically) then it's a bug.\n\n      However, the same point (dx=0, dy=0) is covered.\n\n  In our case, the input string is digits, so no move is made. The entire path is (0,0). So for every step, (x,y)=(0,0). \n\n  Then for any i and j (with j>=i+3) we have:\n        dx=0, dy=0 -> condition: (0<=1 and 0==0) -> true -> flag=false.\n\n  So the output is \"BUG\".\n\nNow, we write the C program.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Read the initial input: we read a string from stdin (without newline? we can use fgets, but note: the first program uses next(), so it reads a token? We assume the input token does not have spaces.\n\n  We'll read until we get a space or newline? But the first program reads a token. We can read one token.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      char input[1000];\n      scanf(\"%s\", input);   // read the initial string\n\n  Then:\n\n      char* S1 = decode_first_program(input);   // we allocate and return a new string.\n\n  Then:\n\n      int N = atoi(S1);\n      free(S1);   // we don't need it anymore.\n\n  Then:\n\n      long result = run_second_program(N);   // with mod 1000000007\n\n  Then:\n\n      char result_str[50];\n      sprintf(result_str, \"%ld\", result);\n\n  Then:\n\n      run_third_program(result_str);   // which will output either \"OK\" or \"BUG\"\n\n  But note: the third program must output with a newline? The Java program uses `System.out.println`, so it outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n  Therefore, we output either:\n        printf(\"OK\\n\");\n        or\n        printf(\"BUG\\n\");\n\nImplementation details:\n\n  We assume the first program's input string is at most 1000 characters.\n\n  We'll write helper functions.\n\nLet's code:\n\n  We include the necessary headers.\n\n  Note: the second program uses a DP table for states 0..63 for each current from 0 to N (which is <=100). And we precompute valid[256] for the last4.\n\n  We must be cautious: the state for the second program: \n        state s: 0..63 -> 64 states.\n\n  The valid array: 256 elements.\n\n  The DP array: [0..100] x [0..63] -> 101*64 = 6464 entries.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      long dp[101][64];   // dp[i][s] for i in [0, N] and s in [0,63]\n\n      Precompute valid[256] as described.\n\n      Then:\n\n          for s in 0..63: \n              dp[N][s] = 1;\n\n          for i from N-1 down to 0:\n              for s in 0..63:\n                  dp[i][s] = 0;\n                  for b in 0..3:\n                      int last4_index = s * 4 + b;\n                      if (valid[last4_index]) {\n                          int s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b;   // shift state: remove the first base, and add b at the end.\n                          dp[i][s] = (dp[i][s] + dp[i+1][s_new]) % MOD;\n                      }\n\n          result = dp[0][63];\n\n  But note: the initial state is 63 (which is TTT).\n\n  However, what if the state s_new is out of [0,63]? \n        s_new = (s % 16) * 4 + b -> s % 16 is in [0,15] -> then *4 -> [0,60] then +b -> [0,63]. So it's in range.\n\n  We assume mod is 1000000007.\n\nNow, we write the entire C program.\n\nNote: we assume the input to the first program is a string of '.' and '-'. \n\nWe'll write:\n\n    char* decode_first_program(const char* n) {\n        // n is the input string\n        int len = strlen(n);\n        // We allocate an output string: the output has at most len characters? \n        // Actually, each input character produces at most one output character? \n        // But the flag might cause two dashes to produce one output? \n        // Actually, the output length is the number of '.' plus the number of complete dashes (each dash that is part of a pair produces one output, and a dash that is alone doesn't produce output until a following character). \n        // But the total output length is the number of tokens: each '.' produces one output, and each dash that is followed by a dash or a dot will eventually produce an output (either 2 for two dashes, or 1 for a dash followed by a dot). \n        // Actually, the output has the same length as the input? Not exactly: \n        //   Example: input \".-\" \n        //        i=0: '.' -> output '0' -> output length=1.\n        //        i=1: '-' -> because s is false, set s=true -> no output.\n        //   So the output is \"0\", which has length 1, while input has length 2.\n\n        // Therefore, we cannot preallocate with the same length. We'll count the output length? Or we can use a dynamic array.\n\n        // We'll use a buffer of the same length (or even the same length is enough) and then we know the output length will be <= len.\n\n        char* output = (char*)malloc(len+1);

Then atoi returns 0. Then run_second_program(0) returns 1? \n  Because: \n      dp[0][63] = 1? \n      But for N=0: \n          We have: \n            for s: dp[0][s] = 0? \n          Actually: \n            We set for i from N-1 down to 0: but N=0, so we skip the loop. Then we return dp[0][63] which is uninitialized? \n\n  We must initialize dp for N=0.\n\n  How does the second program work for N=0?\n      The Java program: \n          current=0, last3=\"TTT\"\n          if current==0 (which is N=0) -> return 1.\n\n      So we should set: \n          if N==0, then we return 1? \n\n      But our dp: \n          We set for i=N (which is 0): \n              for s in 0..63: dp[0][s] = 1   (because we set dp[N][s]=1 for all s, and N=0).\n\n          Then we return dp[0][63] which is 1.\n\n      But then we run the loop for i from N-1 down to 0: which is from -1 down to 0 -> we skip.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  However, note: the state at i=0 is set to 1 for all s? But we only care about state=63? \n\n  Actually, the base case: \n        dp[N][s] = 1 for all s -> that's the base case (at the end of the sequence, regardless of the state, there is 1 way).\n\n  Then we work backwards. For N=0, we do nothing in the loop and return dp[0][63] which was set to 1.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  But note: the valid array and the state representation: we assume that the state is represented as a base4 number of 3 digits. For the initial state \"TTT\", we use 63.\n\n  However, when N=0, we never use the valid array? \n\n  So the program should work.\n\n  But note: the third program: if the second program returns 1, then the string is \"1\". The third program will see:\n        k=0: (0,0)\n        then for each char in \"1\": \n            it's not L,R,U,D -> no move -> then k=1: (0,0)\n\n        Then k=2: (0,0)   [because the string \"1\" has one character, so k=0 and k=1?]\n\n        Actually: \n            k=0: (0,0) -> then we process the first char: \n                no move -> then k=1: (0,0)\n\n            So k=2 points? \n\n        Then we check: \n            i from 0 to k-3 = 0 to 2-3 -> 0 to -1 -> skip the outer loop -> flag remains true -> output \"OK\".\n\n  But wait: k=2, then k-3 = -1 -> the outer loop: i from 0 to k-3 (which is -1) -> condition: 0 <= -1 is false -> skip.\n\n        Then output \"OK\".\n\n  However, the Java program for the third program would have:\n\n        k = 0: (0,0) -> then we process the string of length 1: \n            then k becomes 1: (0,0) -> then k becomes 2: (0,0) -> no, wait:\n\n        The Java program:\n\n            k=0: (0,0) -> then for i=0 to s.length()-1:\n                switch(ch[i]) -> which is '1': no move? \n                then set co[0][k]=x (0), co[1][k]=y (0) -> k=1.\n\n            Then the array of points: \n                index0: (0,0) [k=0]\n                index1: (0,0) [k=1]\n\n            Then k=2? Actually, k is incremented to 1 at the end of the loop? \n\n            Then the loop: \n                for i=0 to k-3: k=2 -> k-3 = -1 -> no loop.\n\n            Then output \"OK\".\n\n  But our third program: \n        k=0: (0,0) -> then we process the string: \n            for i=0 to len-1 (len=1) -> we do:\n                x=0, y=0 -> then we set x_coords[1]=0, y_coords[1]=0 -> k=2.\n\n            Then we have two points: index0: (0,0) and index1: (0,0).\n\n            Then k=2.\n\n            Then we check: \n                for i from 0 to k-3 = 0 to 2-3 = -1 -> skip.\n\n            Then output \"OK\".\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original Java has:\n\n        k=0: (x,y) = (0,0) -> stored at index0 -> then k=1.\n        Then for each move, we update x,y and then store at k and then k++.\n\n        So the number of points is k = (number of moves) + 1.\n\n        In the Java program: \n            k = 0 initially, then after storing the start, k=1.\n            Then for each character, we update and then store at k and then k++.\n\n        So at the end, k = s.length()+1.\n\n        We do the same.\n\n  Therefore, the program is complete.\n\n  We must note: the second program might have an integer overflow? We use mod.\n\n  Let's test with N=0: \n        result = 1 -> string \"1\" -> third program: outputs \"OK\"\n\n  With N=1: \n        We'll compute: \n            dp[1][s] for all s: set to 1.\n            then for i=0: \n                s=63, then for b in 0..3:\n                    last4_index = 63*4 + b = 252+b -> we need to check valid[252+b] for b in {0,1,2,3}\n\n        How to compute valid for state 63 (which is \"TTT\") and then base b: \n            The last4 = \"TTT\" + base (one of 'A','C','G','T') -> so \"TTTA\", \"TTTC\", \"TTTG\", \"TTTT\"\n\n        Check \"TTTA\": \n            Does it contain \"AGC\"? -> no.\n            Check swaps:\n                swap0: swap first and second -> \"TTTA\" -> becomes \"TTTA\" (same) -> no \"AGC\"\n                swap1: swap second and third -> \"TTTA\" becomes \"TTTA\" -> same? \n                swap2: swap third and fourth: \"TTTA\" becomes \"TTAT\"\n\n            Now, \"TTAT\" does not contain \"AGC\", so valid.\n\n            Similarly, we can check the others.\n\n        Actually, we need to check for each base.\n\n        So the state 0 (i=0) with state s=63: \n            for each base, the last4 is \"TTT\"+base, and all are valid? \n            Then we add 4 * 1 = 4.\n\n            So dp[0][63] = 4.\n\n        Then the result for N=1 is 4.\n\n        Then the third program: \n            input string = \"4\" (one character)\n            Then the path: \n                k0: (0,0)\n                k1: (0,0)   [because the character '4' is not a move]\n            Then we have two points: (0,0) and (0,0). \n            Then check: \n                i=0, j from i+3=3 to k-1=1 -> j=3 is beyond k-1=1 -> skip.\n            So flag=true -> output \"OK\"\n\n  So the program outputs \"OK\" for N=1.\n\n  We'll write the entire code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the third program might get a large string? The second program's result can be up to 4^N mod 1000000007, which for N=100 is about 4^100 mod 1000000007 -> but 4^100 is a 60-digit number? \n\n  But we are converting the long integer to a string. However, the third program will allocate an array for the coordinates of size (strlen(result_str)+1. The string can be up to 50 digits -> so 50+1 points, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the third program has two nested loops: the outer loop runs for k-3, and the inner loop runs for k - (i+3). \n        k = length of the string (which is the number of digits in the result) + 1 -> at most 50+1=51.\n\n        Then the total iterations: \n            for i from 0 to 48 (if k=51) -> 49 * (51 - i - 3) -> worst-case: i=0: 48, i=1:47, ... -> about O(k^2) -> 51*51 = 2601, which is acceptable.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n  Note: we use strstr in the second program's precomputation. We need <string.h>."
