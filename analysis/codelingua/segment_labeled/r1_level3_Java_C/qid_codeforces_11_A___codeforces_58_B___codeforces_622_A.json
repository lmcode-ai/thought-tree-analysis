Third program: \n            position=3. nrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n            getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1 + 1*2/2 = 1+1 = 2 -> which is <3 -> then multiply by 2 -> nrstSeqStartIndx=2. Then check nrstSeqStartIndx*2=4: getValueAtIndex(4)= 1 + (4-1)*4/2 = 1+3*4/2=1+12/2=1+6=7 -> which is >=3 -> so we break the doubling. Then we check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)= 1 + (3-1)*3/2 = 1+2*3/2=1+6/2=1+3=4 -> which is >3 -> so we don't increment.

For example, if position=1. nrstSeqStartIndx=1. getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> which is >=1? no, 2>=1 -> but condition is <1 -> 2<1 is false -> so the doubling loop doesn't run. Then the next while: check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=2 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> which is >=1? 2<=1 -> false? no, 2<=1 is false -> so we don't increment. Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n        result_third = 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n   Correct. Another example: position=2. Doubling: at index=1 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> condition: 2<2 -> false -> so we break. Then check index+1=2: getValueAtIndex(2)=2 <=2 -> true -> so we increment to 2. Then check index+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)=4>2 -> break. Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n        result_third = 2-2+1=1.

Therefore, the result should be 2? But the program: \n            The block starting at index=2: the first element of that block is 2 (at position 2) and then the next is 3 (position 3) and so on. The program computes: \n            position=2 -> the block index=2: the starting index of the block is 2 (the value at index=2: which is the first element of the block?). Then the position 2 is the first element in the block? so 1.

Infinite Sequence\"\n\n            Problem: \n                A sequence is defined as: \n                    a_1 = 1\n                    a_2 = 2\n                    a_3 = 2\n                    a_4 = 3\n                    a_5 = 3\n                    a_6 = 3\n                    ... \n                Find the number at the n-th position. So the program: \n                It reads a long: the position (n-th position). It then finds the block: the block that contains the n-th position. How? The block for number k starts at: 1 + (k-1)*k/2. Then the number at position n is: k, where k is the smallest integer such that 1 + k*(k+1)/2 >= n? Actually, no: the starting index of block k is: s_k = 1 + (k-1)*k/2. Then the block k occupies positions: s_k, s_k+1, ... , s_k + k - 1. We want k such that s_k <= n < s_k + k.\n\n                Then the number is k. But the program outputs: (n - s_k) + 1 -> which is the offset within the block? Why?",

First program (codeforces_11_A) reads two integers (n and d) and then an array of n integers.\n    It computes a result (an integer) and prints it.\n\n 2. Second program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer (n) and then prints a sequence of integers (each followed by a space) \n    starting with n and then decreasing, printing only those that are divisors of the last printed number.\n\n 3. Third program (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer (position) and then computes and prints a single integer.\n\n We must simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O. That means:\n   - The first program will read from stdin (as given to the entire chain).\n   - The output of the first program (an integer) will be the input to the second program (which expects an integer).\n   - The output of the second program is a sequence of integers (each printed on the same line with a space) and then the last number is printed without a trailing space? \n     Actually, the second program prints each number followed by a space (including the last one). But note: the third program expects a single long integer.\n\n However, the second program outputs multiple integers on the same line? Actually, the second program does:\n      System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This prints n and a space and then a newline? Actually, no: println adds a newline.\n      Then, for each divisor it does: System.out.println(i + \" \"); -> which prints i, a space, and then a newline.\n\n But wait: the example output of the second program would be multiple lines? However, the third program expects a single long.\n\n This indicates that the chain might not be designed to work together. We must reconcile the outputs and inputs.\n\n Clarification from the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How is the second program's output (multiple lines) going to be the input of the third program (which reads a single long)?\n\n We must reexamine the problem: we are to reproduce the same behavior as the entire sequence.\n\n Let me see what the original chain does:\n\n   Input to first program: for example, \n        n = 3, d = 2, and array = [3, 1, 4]\n\n   First program: \n        It will compute:\n          i=1: a = 3-1 = 2 -> positive -> result += (2/2+1) = 1+1 = 2 -> then set nums[1] = 1 + 2*2 = 5.\n          Then i=2: a = 5-4=1 -> positive -> result += (1/2+1) -> 0+1 = 1 -> total result=3.\n        So it outputs 3.\n\n   Second program: \n        Input is 3 (from the first program's output).\n        Output: \n            \"3 \" (with println -> so \"3 \\n\")\n            Then i=2: 3%2 !=0 -> skip.\n            Then i=1: 3%1==0 -> then print \"1 \\n\", and set m=1.\n            Then i=0 -> loop ends.\n        So the output is two lines: \"3 \\n\" and \"1 \\n\".\n\n   Third program:\n        It reads a long. How does it handle two lines? It will read the first token \"3\" and ignore the rest? \n        But the third program expects one long. The input to the third program is:\n            \"3\\n1\\n\"\n\n        The third program's sc.nextLong() will read the 3 and ignore the rest? Then the 1 will be left unread? \n        But the third program only reads one long. So it uses 3 as the input.\n\n        So the third program will compute for position=3.\n\n        How it works:\n          It finds the largest nrstSeqStartIndx such that getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx) <= 3.\n          getValueAtIndex(1) = 1\n          getValueAtIndex(2) = 2\n          getValueAtIndex(3) = 4 -> which is > 3, so we take 2.\n\n          Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2) = 2.\n          Then output = (3-2)+1 = 2.\n\n        So the entire chain outputs 2.\n\n But note: the second program actually outputs two numbers: 3 and 1. The third program only uses the first one.\n\n This is a problem because the chain is defined as the output of one program becomes the input of the next. \n However, the second program outputs two numbers (on two lines) and the third program only uses the first.\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n This implies that the entire output of the second program (both numbers) is the input to the third? \n Then the third program would break because it expects one number.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program's output is the entire sequence, but the third program only uses the first token.\n\n However, the problem does not specify how the programs are connected (as in, if multiple outputs are passed, how they are parsed). \n\n But note: the original Java programs are designed to read from stdin. In a chain, the output of the first is piped to the second, and the output of the second is piped to the third.\n\n When you run in a shell:\n     java A | java B | java C\n\n Then the second program (B) writes two lines, and the third program (C) reads the first token (the first long) and leaves the rest unread.\n\n So the behavior is that the third program only reads the first token of the second program's output.\n\n Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n   Step1: Run the first program and capture its output (one integer, which we assume is printed without any extra spaces or newlines? Actually, the first program does println(result) -> so it's an integer and a newline).\n\n   Step2: The second program reads the first integer from its input (which is the output of the first program). It then produces multiple integers, each on a new line.\n\n   Step3: The third program reads the first token from its input (which is the first token of the second program's output). The second program's first token is the integer it printed first (the same as the input to the second program?).\n\n So the third program actually uses the same integer that the second program received (which is the output of the first program).\n\n Therefore, we can skip the second program's extra outputs? Because the third program only uses the first token.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The same behavior includes that the second program writes multiple numbers, but the third program only reads the first.\n\n So in our combined C program, we can do:\n\n   - Run the first program's logic and get the integer result (call it x).\n   - Then run the second program's logic with input x. But we only care about the first number it outputs? \n        Actually, the second program outputs x first (on the first line). The rest of the output is not used by the third program.\n\n   But note: the second program does not output anything else that the third program would read? The third program only reads one long.\n\n   Therefore, we can run the second program and capture the first number it outputs (which is the same as the input to the second program) and then ignore the rest? \n   However, the problem says: the entire sequence. But the third program ignores the rest.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note: the second program's output for the first number is exactly the input it got. So we can use the same value (x) as the input to the third program.\n\n   Why? Because the second program's first output is the integer it read.\n\n   Therefore, the input to the third program is x (the same as the output of the first program).\n\n   So the entire chain is:\n\n        first_program_output = first_program(input)\n        third_program_input = first_program_output   // because the second program's first output is the same as its input.\n\n   Then run the third program with third_program_input.\n\n   But wait: what if the second program outputs a different number? Actually, the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This prints n and a space and then a newline.\n\n        Then the loop: it prints other numbers on separate lines.\n\n   The first token of the second program's output is n (the same as the input). \n\n   Therefore, we can skip running the second program's logic? We only need the first token of its output, which is the same as its input.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must run the second program? But note that the second program might have side effects? \n   But in our combined program, we are not actually printing. We are only capturing the output that the next program reads.\n\n   Since the next program (third) only reads the first token, we can capture the first token of the second program's output without running the entire loop? \n\n   Actually, the second program's first token is exactly the input n. So we can just use n as the input to the third program.\n\n   But note: what if the second program doesn't output anything? Then we have a problem. But it always outputs at least the first number.\n\n   Therefore, the chain simplifies:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program: n, d, and an array of n integers.\n        Step2: Compute the result of the first program (an integer, say x).\n        Step3: The second program is given x. It will output at least the number x (as the first token). \n        Step4: The third program is given the first token of the second program's output, which is x.\n\n        So we can run the third program with x.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the second program might output a different representation? For example, if the integer is 3, it outputs \"3 \" (with a space) and then a newline. \n        The third program's scanner will read the integer 3 and stop at the space. Then the next token would be the next integer? But the third program only reads one token.\n\n   Actually, the third program uses sc.nextLong() which reads the next token (a string of non-whitespace). The token for the first number is \"3\", and then the space is a delimiter.\n\n   So the third program will read the integer 3 correctly.\n\n   But in our combined program, we are not going to generate the entire output of the second program. We are only going to use the value x (which we already have) as the input to the third program.\n\n   Therefore, we can avoid simulating the entire second program? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". But note: the second program has a loop that runs from n-1 down to 1. For large n, this might be expensive. \n   But we are to reproduce the same behavior. The third program doesn't use the rest of the output, but the second program must be run? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify that we must compute the entire output of the second program. It says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the entire chain is:\n\n        Input -> first program -> output x -> second program outputs a sequence of numbers starting with x -> third program reads the first token (x) and then outputs a result.\n\n   So the second program's side effect (if any) is not visible because we are not printing it. And the third program doesn't read beyond the first token.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the second program's loop? We only need the first token of its output, which is x.\n\n   But note: the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n\n        Then the loop: for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) ... and prints when m%i==0.\n\n        The first token of the output is the string representation of n (without any formatting issues?).\n\n   Since the third program only reads that first token, we can avoid running the loop? \n\n   However, the problem does not allow us to change the logic arbitrarily. We must reproduce the same behavior.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" in the intermediate steps. We are not printing the second program's entire output. We are only passing the value that the third program actually reads.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program and compute x.\n        Step2: Use x as the input for the third program.\n\n   And skip the second program? \n\n   This would be valid because the second program's output beyond the first token is irrelevant to the third program.\n\n   However, what if the second program had other side effects? It doesn't. It only prints.\n\n   And we are told that intermediate steps should not do I/O.\n\n   But the problem says: \"translate the entire sequence\". So we must include the second program? \n\n   Alternatively, we can run the second program and capture the first token it would output? But note: the second program's first token is exactly the input n.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        int x = ...;   // output of first program\n        // Then the second program would output x as the first token. So we set the input to the third program to x.\n\n   Therefore, we do not need to run the loop of the second program at all.\n\n   But wait: what if the second program doesn't output the same n? It does: the first thing it does is print n (with a space and a newline). \n\n   However, the third program only reads the token n. So we can use x (which is the same n) as the input to the third program.\n\n   So the entire chain can be:\n\n        Read n1, d, and the array of n1 integers -> compute the result x (from the first program).\n        Then run the third program with input x (which is a long) and compute its result.\n\n   However, note: the second program is supposed to be run. The problem says to chain the entire sequence. \n\n   But the problem also says: \"without I/O\" in the intermediate steps. We are allowed to skip the second program's output beyond what the third program uses? \n\n   Alternatively, we can run the second program and break after the first token? But the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This is the first token.\n\n        Then the loop: we don't need to run the loop because the third program doesn't read the rest.\n\n   However, the second program's loop might be heavy? But we are to reproduce the same behavior. The problem does not specify that we can skip the second program's computation.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" in the intermediate steps. We are not going to actually print the intermediate outputs. So we can avoid the printing, but we must do the same computation? \n\n   Actually, the second program's computation is not used by the third program. And the problem does not require that we do the same computation if it is not necessary for the output.\n\n   However, to be safe and to exactly follow the specification, we must run the entire second program? \n\n   But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the entire chain is defined by the output of the third program.\n\n   And the output of the third program only depends on the first token of the second program's output, which is the input to the second program.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the second program entirely? \n\n   After reconsideration: the problem does not require that we run the second program if its output beyond the first token is not used? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\".\n\n   However, the problem also says: \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". We are allowed to compute without printing. But note: the second program's loop might be heavy and we cannot skip it? \n\n   But observe: the second program's loop runs from n-1 down to 1. For large n, this is O(n). We don't want to do that if we don't have to.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the constraints. We must be faithful to the original.\n\n   However, the third program only uses the first token. And the first token is printed at the beginning. So we can avoid the loop? \n\n   Actually, the second program's loop condition is:\n\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--)\n\n   and then does modulus and printing. But note: the printing is the only side effect. If we are not doing I/O, then the loop does nothing? \n\n   Because the modulus and assignment to m are only used to decide what to print. Since we are not printing, we can skip the entire loop? \n\n   Therefore, we can simulate the second program by:\n\n        n_second = x;   // the output from the first program\n        // We are going to \"simulate\" the second program without printing: \n        //   The first token we care about is n_second.\n        //   The loop: we don't need to run because we are not printing, and the third program doesn't read the output.\n\n        // But note: the assignment to m? It is only used in the loop and for printing. So we don't need to run the loop at all.\n\n   So we can skip the loop.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain can be implemented as:\n\n        Step1: Read n, d, and the array of n integers (as in the first program).\n        Step2: Compute the result x of the first program (as in the first program).\n        Step3: Set the input to the third program to be x (a long).\n        Step4: Run the third program's logic on x.\n\n   However, let me check with the example:\n\n        First program: input [3,2] and array [3,1,4] -> output x=3.\n\n        Then the third program: input 3 -> output 2.\n\n        The example chain output is 2.\n\n   But what if the second program had an effect? What if the second program for a different input? \n\n   Actually, the second program's output beyond the first token is not read by the third program. So the chain's final output is the same as if we skipped the second program? \n\n   This seems to be the case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". To be safe, we should run the second program's logic without printing? \n\n   But the second program's logic is:\n\n        m = n;\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                // print i and set m = i;\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n   This changes m and then uses m in the modulus condition. But we are not printing, so the only effect is on the variable m? Which is then unused after the loop? \n\n   So the entire loop has no side effect that is visible to the rest of the program? \n\n   Therefore, we can skip the loop.\n\n   But note: the second program does not change any global state. It only prints. And we are not printing in the intermediate steps.\n\n   So we can skip the entire second program? \n\n   Therefore, the combined C program:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program: n, d, and then n integers.\n        Step2: Compute the result x of the first program (as in the first Java program).\n        Step3: Use x as the input for the third program and compute the third program's output.\n\n   Now, we must implement the first and third programs in C.\n\n   However, note the third program uses a method getValueAtIndex which returns a long.\n\n   We must be cautious about integer overflows? The third program uses long.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        long position = x;   // the value we got from the first program\n\n        long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        }\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) \n            nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\n        long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n        long result = (position - startIndex) + 1;\n\n        Then output result.\n\n   We'll write a helper function for getValueAtIndex:\n\n        long getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n            return 1 + (index-1)*index / 2;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the expression (index-1)*index might be very large? But the problem uses long.\n\n   Now, let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the second program is completely skipped? We are not running it at all. Is that acceptable?\n\n   The problem says: \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". We are not doing I/O for the second step. But we are also not processing the second step? \n\n   We are processing the second step by noticing that it doesn't affect the input to the third step. So we skip the entire second step.\n\n   This is an optimization? But the problem does not require that we run the second step if it doesn't affect the output? \n\n   However, to be faithful, we could run the second step without printing. But the second step's computation is:\n\n        m = n;\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n   This computation does not change the value that is passed to the third program. So it doesn't matter.\n\n   Therefore, we skip it.\n\n   So the entire C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        // Function for the third program\n        long long getValueAtIndex(long long index) {\n            return 1 + (index-1)*index / 2;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read input for the first program\n            int n, d;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &d);\n            int *nums = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &nums[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (x)\n            int result_first = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                int a = nums[i-1] - nums[i];\n                if (a >= 0) {\n                    int steps = a / d + 1;\n                    result_first += steps;\n                    nums[i] += steps * d;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now, the output of the first program is result_first.\n\n            // Step 3: This result_first becomes the input to the third program (as the first token of the second program's output, which is the same as the input to the second program).\n\n            long long position = result_first;   // the input to the third program\n\n            // Step 4: Run the third program's logic\n            long long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n            // We are going to double nrstSeqStartIndx until the value at 2*nrstSeqStartIndx is >= position?\n            // Actually, the condition: while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n            }\n            // Then we increment until the next index would exceed the position.\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n            }\n\n            long long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n            long long result_third = position - startIndex + 1;\n\n            // Output the result of the third program\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", result_third);\n\n            free(nums);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But wait: what if the first program's result (result_first) is negative? The first program's logic: \n        It only adds when a>=0. So result_first is nonnegative.\n\n   And the third program expects a long (which in C we use long long to match Java's long). And the input position is nonnegative.\n\n   Also, the function getValueAtIndex: \n        For index=0: (0-1)*0/2 -> (-1)*0/2 = 0 -> 1+0=1? But the function is only called with positive index.\n\n   The loop in the third program: \n        It starts at 1 and multiplies by 2 until the value at index*2 is >= position.\n\n   Then it increments until the next index would exceed the position.\n\n   This should be safe.\n\n   However, note: the third program in Java uses a class with a buffer and a PrintWriter. But we are just using printf.\n\n   We are also reading with scanf, which might be unsafe for large inputs? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior.\n\n   We assume the input is well-formed.\n\n   Let me test with the example: \n        First program: n=3, d=2, array=[3,1,4] -> result_first=3.\n\n        Third program: \n            position=3.\n            nrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n            getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1 + 1*2/2 = 1+1 = 2 -> which is <3 -> then multiply by 2 -> nrstSeqStartIndx=2.\n            Then check nrstSeqStartIndx*2=4: getValueAtIndex(4)= 1 + (4-1)*4/2 = 1+3*4/2=1+12/2=1+6=7 -> which is >=3 -> so we break the doubling.\n\n            Then we check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)= 1 + (3-1)*3/2 = 1+2*3/2=1+6/2=1+3=4 -> which is >3 -> so we don't increment.\n\n            Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n            result_third = 3-2+1 = 2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   But the example chain output is 2.\n\n   However, note: the third program in the original Java code has:\n\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        }\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\n   In the example, after doubling we have nrstSeqStartIndx=2. Then we check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)=4 which is >3, so we do not increment.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   But what if the doubling loop doesn't run at all? For example, if position=1.\n\n        nrstSeqStartIndx=1.\n        getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> which is >=1? no, 2>=1 -> but condition is <1 -> 2<1 is false -> so the doubling loop doesn't run.\n\n        Then the next while: check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=2 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> which is >=1? 2<=1 -> false? no, 2<=1 is false -> so we don't increment.\n\n        Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n        result_third = 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another example: position=2.\n\n        Doubling: at index=1 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2 -> condition: 2<2 -> false -> so we break.\n        Then check index+1=2: getValueAtIndex(2)=2 <=2 -> true -> so we increment to 2.\n        Then check index+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)=4>2 -> break.\n\n        Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n        result_third = 2-2+1=1.\n\n   But wait: the sequence is:\n        index1: 1\n        index2: 2,3\n        index3: 4,5,6\n        ...\n\n        So the number 2 is the second element? The first element is 1, the second is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the result should be 2? \n\n        But the program: \n            The block starting at index=2: the first element of that block is 2 (at position 2) and then the next is 3 (position 3) and so on.\n\n        The program computes: \n            position=2 -> the block index=2: the starting index of the block is 2 (the value at index=2: which is the first element of the block?).\n\n            Then the position 2 is the first element in the block? so 1.\n\n        But the problem: \n            The sequence: \n                n=1: 1\n                n=2: 1,2\n                n=3: 1,2,2\n                n=4: 1,2,2,3\n                ...?\n\n        Actually, the function getValueAtIndex(n) returns the starting index of the block? \n\n        The sequence is defined as: the triangular numbers? \n            The block for n: it has n elements? \n            The starting index of the block for n is: 1 + (n-1)*n/2.\n\n        Then the block for n=2: starts at index = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2, and has 2 elements: [2,3]?\n        But the sequence is: \n            position1: 1\n            position2: 2\n            position3: 2\n            position4: 3\n            position5: 3\n            position6: 3\n            ...\n\n        Actually, the description: \n            The sequence: \n                The number 1 appears once.\n                The number 2 appears twice.\n                The number 3 appears three times.\n\n        So the starting index for the block of number k is: 1 + (k-1)*k/2? \n\n        Then the starting index for k=1: 1\n        for k=2: 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2 -> so the block for 2 is at positions 2 and 3.\n        for k=3: 1 + (3-1)*3/2 = 1+2*3/2=1+3=4 -> so the block for 3 is at positions 4,5,6.\n\n        Therefore, the element at position 2 is the first element of the block for k=2 -> so the number 2.\n\n        How do we get the number? \n            The number at position p: \n                We find the largest k such that the starting index of k is <= p.\n                Then the number is k? \n\n            Actually, the example: \n                position 2: k=2 -> starting index=2 -> then the offset is 0 -> so the element is 2? \n\n            But the program outputs: (p - startIndex) + 1 -> which is (2-2)+1 = 1? \n\n        What is that 1? \n\n        The program says: \n            out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n\n        So for position=2: (2-2)+1 = 1.\n\n        But the element at position 2 should be 2, not 1.\n\n        This indicates a misunderstanding.\n\n        The program's getValueAtIndex returns the starting index of the block for the number k? \n\n        Then the block for k=2: \n            starts at 2 and has 2 elements: \n                position2: the first element -> which is 2? \n                position3: the second element -> which is 2.\n\n        How does the program compute the number? \n\n        The program does not output the number k. It outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1.\n\n        For position2: (2-2)+1=1 -> which is not 2.\n\n        What is the expected output? \n\n        The problem of the third program: \n            \"A.

But the program outputs 2.\n\n        This does not match.\n\n        Alternatively, the codeforces problem 622A is:\n\n            \"A.

So it matches.\n\n            For n=4: \n                We need to find k: \n                    getValueAtIndex(3)= 1 + (3-1)*3/2 = 1+2*3/2=1+3=4 -> <=4.\n                    then check k=4: getValueAtIndex(4)=1+ (4-1)*4/2=1+3*4/2=1+6=7 -> >4, so k=3.\n                Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(3)=4.\n                (4-4)+1=1 -> but the number at position4 should be 3.\n\n            So it does not match.\n\n        What is the value of nrstSeqStartIndx for n=4?\n            doubling: \n                start with 1: \n                    getValueAtIndex(2)=2 <4 -> so double to 2.\n                then getValueAtIndex(4)=7 >=4 -> break.\n                then while (getValueAtIndex(2+1)=getValueAtIndex(3)=4<=4 -> so nrstSeqStartIndx becomes 3.\n                then check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=4: getValueAtIndex(4)=7>4 -> break.\n\n                so nrstSeqStartIndx=3.\n                startIndex = 4.\n                output = (4-4)+1 = 1.\n\n        But the expected number at position4 is 3.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        The problem: the number at position n is the value of k for which the block covers n.\n\n        The block for k=1: [1,1] -> covers position1.\n        for k=2: [2,3] -> covers positions 2 and 3.\n        for k=3: [4,6] -> covers positions 4,5,6.\n\n        So at position4: k=3.\n\n        The program outputs 1, but should output 3.\n\n        How does the program in the Java file solve it? \n\n        The Java program in file 3 is:\n\n            public static void solve() {\n                long position = sc.nextLong();\n                long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n                while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n                }\n                while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n                long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n                out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n            }\n\n        And the example position=4:\n\n            It sets nrstSeqStartIndx=3 (as above).\n            Then it outputs (4 - startIndex) + 1 = (4-4)+1=1.\n\n        This is not the number 3.\n\n        I see: the variable nrstSeqStartIndx is not k. It is the index of the block? \n\n        The block number is nrstSeqStartIndx? \n            The block number k should be the one that contains the position.\n\n        But the program is not outputting k. It is outputting the offset within the block plus 1.\n\n        Why plus one? \n\n        The offset within the block for position4: it is the first element in the block of k=3 -> so offset0? then 0+1=1.\n\n        But the problem asks for the number at the position, which is k=3.\n\n        So the program is not outputting k, but the offset+1.\n\n        This is not what the problem asks.\n\n        This suggests the program is for a different problem.\n\n        Looking at the codeforces submission for 622A: \n\n            Accepted solution in Java for 622A:\n\n                import java.util.Scanner;\n                public class a {\n                    public static void main(String[] args) {\n                        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n                        long n = in.nextLong();\n                        long i = 1;\n                        while (n > i) {\n                            n -= i;\n                            i++;\n                        }\n                        System.out.println(n);\n                    }\n                }\n\n        This is the common solution.\n\n        But the provided program is different.\n\n        Alternatively, the provided program might be for a different problem? \n\n        The file is named \"codeforces_622_A\", which might be problem 622A.\n\n        But the program does not match.\n\n        Let me check the function getValueAtIndex: \n            It returns: 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\n        This is the starting index of the block for the number 'index' in the sequence of triangular numbers? \n\n        In the sequence of triangular numbers, the block for the number k is the k-th triangular number? \n\n        But the problem of the sequence 1,2,2,3,3,3,... is not about triangular numbers in the usual sense.\n\n        The starting index for the number k is: 1 + (k-1)*k/2.\n\n        Then the number at position n is the value of k for which the block contains n.\n\n        And the offset within the block is: n - startIndex.\n\n        But the problem asks for k, not the offset.\n\n        However, the program outputs the offset+1.\n\n        This is likely a different problem.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem says to translate the entire sequence, we will faithfully translate the provided Java programs.\n\n        Therefore, the third program in our chain will output (position - startIndex)+1.\n\n        In the example with position=3: outputs 2.\n        In the example with position=4: outputs 1.\n\n        So be it.\n\n        Our chain: \n            Input: n, d, array -> first program outputs x.\n            then the third program on input x outputs (x - startIndex)+1.\n\n        We have no control over the logic of the third program; we are just translating.\n\n        Therefore, the C program is as above.\n\n   One more note: the second program is completely omitted. \n\n   We are confident that the first token of the second program's output is the integer it read, which is x.\n\n   So we pass x to the third program.\n\n   Therefore, the final C program is:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        // Helper function for the third program\n        long long getValueAtIndex(long long index) {\n            return 1 + (index-1)*index/2;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // First program's input\n            int n, d;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &d);\n            int *nums = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &nums[i]);\n            }\n\n            // First program's logic\n            int result_first = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                int a = nums[i-1] - nums[i];\n                if (a >= 0) {\n                    int steps = a / d + 1;\n                    result_first += steps;\n                    nums[i] += steps * d;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now, the third program uses result_first as its input (position)\n            long long position = result_first;\n\n            // Third program's logic\n            long long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n            }\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n            }\n            long long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n            long long result_third = (position - startIndex) + 1;\n\n            // Output the result\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", result_third);\n\n            free(nums);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Note: We use long long for the third program to match Java's long.\n\n   Let me test with the example: \n        first program: n=3, d=2, array = [3,1,4] -> result_first=3.\n        third program: \n            getValueAtIndex(1)=1, getValueAtIndex(2)=2, getValueAtIndex(4)=7.\n            doubling: start at 1 -> 2: getValueAtIndex(2)=2<3 -> so nrstSeqStartIndx=2.\n            then check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)=1+(3-1)*3/2 = 1+2*3/2=1+3=4 -> 4<=3? no -> so nrstSeqStartIndx remains 2.\n            startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n            result_third = (3-2)+1 = 2.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But what if the first program's output is 4?\n        In the third program for position=4:\n            doubling: \n                nrstSeqStartIndx=1 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2<4 -> so double to 2.\n                getValueAtIndex(4)=7>=4 -> break.\n                then check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=3: getValueAtIndex(3)=4<=4 -> so increment to 3.\n                then check nrstSeqStartIndx+1=4: getValueAtIndex(4)=7>4 -> break.\n                startIndex = getValueAtIndex(3)=4.\n                result_third = (4-4)+1 = 1.\n\n   So we output 1.\n\n   This is as the provided third program would do.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   Note: We assume that the second program's output is not used beyond the first token, which is the same as its input.\n\n   We do not simulate the second program because its output beyond the first token is not used, and the first token is its input.\n\n   And the second program's computation has no side effect that affects the first token.\n\n   So we skip it.\n\n   Final code."
