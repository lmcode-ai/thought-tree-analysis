  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (atcoder_ABC172_D) reads an integer `n` and outputs a long integer (the result of the computation).\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and outputs the next character (the first character of the input string incremented by one). But note: the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number. So we must convert the number to a string? However, the problem says the output of the first is used as input to the second.\n\nBut the second program expects a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program reads that string and then takes the first character '1', adds 1 to get '2', and prints '2'. However, the third program then reads a string which is the output of the second program (a single character?).\n\nBut wait, the third program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string and then checks if the frequency of characters in that string has at most one odd count (or an odd number of odd counts) to decide whether to print \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nHowever, the chain is:\n\nInput to the entire system is the input to the first program (an integer). Then the first program outputs a long integer. The second program takes that long integer as a string and outputs the next character of the first character of that string. Then the third program takes that single character as input? Then it would be a string of length 1.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs a single character (using `printf(\"%c\", ...)`). So the output is a single character. Then the third program reads a string of length 1.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\nStep 1: Read integer n, compute a long value and output it (as a string without any extra spaces, just the number).\n\nStep 2: Read the string (which is the number from step1). Then take the first character of that string, add 1 to it (so '0' becomes '1', '1' becomes '2', etc.), and output that single character.\n\nStep 3: Read a string (which is a single character). Then count the frequency of each character (only one character, so frequency is 1). Then oddCount = 1 (which is <=1) so it prints \"First\".\n\nBut wait, the second program: what if the output of the first program is a string with multiple digits? The second program only takes the first character and increments it. Then the third program gets a string of length 1.\n\nHowever, we are to chain these without intermediate I/O? So we must simulate the entire chain in one C program.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. The entire program will read one integer from stdin (for the first step).\n2. Then we compute the result of the first program (without printing, just store it in a variable and then convert to a string to simulate the output that becomes the input to the second).\n3. Then we take the string (the output of the first) and process it as the second program: take the first character and add 1. But note: the second program outputs a single character. So we have a string of one character for the next step.\n4. Then we take that single character string and use it as the input for the third program: we need to count the frequency of each character (which is just one character, so we have a map with one key and value 1). Then we count the oddCount: which will be 1. Then we check: if oddCount<=1 or oddCount%2!=0 -> then print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nBut note: the third program does not know the input is a single character. It just reads a string. So we must simulate the entire chain.\n\nHowever, the challenge: we are to write a single C program that does all three steps without any intermediate I/O (only the first reads from stdin, only the last writes to stdout).\n\nWe break down:\n\nStep 1: \n   Read an integer n.\n   Compute: \n        long ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            long t = n / i;   // integer division\n            ans += (long)i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n        }\n\nStep 2:\n   Convert the long integer `ans` to a string. Then take the first character of that string and add 1. Then we have a single character (which we store as a string for step3).\n\nStep 3:\n   We have a string of length 1 (from step2). Then we need to count the frequency of each character in that string (so one character with count 1). Then:\n        oddCount = 1 (because 1 is odd).\n        Condition: if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> then output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nBut note: the condition in the third program is:\n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n        Actually, the condition is written as:\n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\n        But note: the condition is \"if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\" -> that is always true? Because if oddCount is 0, 1, 2, ... \n        Actually, if oddCount is 0: 0<=1 -> true.\n        if oddCount is 1: true.\n        if oddCount is 2: then 2<=1 is false, but 2%2==0 -> so condition false? Then we go to else.\n        But wait the condition is: \n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n        So for oddCount=2: condition is false? Then print \"Second\".\n        But the problem in the third program says: \n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n            -> print \"First\"\n            else \n            -> print \"Second\"\n\n        Actually, the condition is written as:\n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\n\n        However, note the logical OR: if either condition is true then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\n        But the problem says: \n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n            -> First\n            else \n            -> Second\n\n        So for oddCount=0: true -> First\n        oddCount=1: true -> First\n        oddCount=2: false -> Second\n        oddCount=3: true (because 3%2!=0) -> First\n        oddCount=4: false -> Second\n        oddCount=5: true -> First\n\n        So the condition is: if the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if the number of odd counts is odd? Actually, the condition is:\n            (oddCount <= 1) OR (oddCount % 2 != 0)\n\n        So oddCount=3: 3<=1 is false, but 3%2!=0 -> true -> First.\n\n        In our case, the string from step2 is one character, so oddCount=1 -> First.\n\nHowever, we must note that the third program was designed for a game where the string can be of any length. But in our chain, the string is always of length 1.\n\nBut we are to simulate the entire chain as given.\n\nSo the C program:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read an integer n from stdin.\n2. Compute the long integer `ans` as in the first Java program.\n3. Convert `ans` to a string. Then take the first character of that string and add 1 to it. Let the result be a character `c`. Then we form a string of length 1: `c` (and null terminator).\n4. For the third step, we have the string from step3 (which is a single character). Then we count the frequency of each character (which is just one character). Then we count the oddCount: which is 1 (because the frequency is 1, which is odd). Then we check: \n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> then we print \"First\"\n        else print \"Second\"\n\nBut note: the third program does not know the string length in advance. We must process the entire string (which is one char).\n\nHowever, in the chain, the second program outputs a single character. So the string for the third program is of length 1.\n\nBut to be general as per the third program, we should write code that counts frequencies for any string? But in this chain, the string is always one character. But we do as the third program: we iterate over the string and build a frequency map.\n\nBut in C, we can do:\n\n   char str[2]; // to hold the one char and null terminator.\n   We set: str[0] = the character from step2, str[1] = '\\0'\n\n   Then we create an array of 256 integers (for ASCII) to count frequencies? Or since we know it's one char, we can do:\n\n   Actually, the third Java program uses a HashMap. But we know the string is short. We can do:\n\n        int freq[256] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n        for (int i = 0; str[i]; i++) {\n            freq[(unsigned char)(str[i])]++;\n        }\n        int oddCount = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n            if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                oddCount++;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Second\\n\");\n        }\n\nBut note: the third program in Java does:\n\n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n            -> First\n        else\n            -> Second\n\nSo we do the same.\n\nHowever, the chain: the first program outputs a long integer, which might be a string of digits. The second program takes the first character and increments it. What if the first character is '9'? Then '9' + 1 is not '10' but the next ASCII value which is ':'. But the Java code: `s.charAt(0) + 1` is an integer. Then we cast to char? Actually, the Java code uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`, so it prints the character corresponding to that integer.\n\nIn C, we do the same: we take the first character of the string representation of `ans` and add 1. Then we output that as a character? But note: we are not outputting, we are storing for the next step.\n\nExample: \n   If `ans` is 123, then the string is \"123\". The first character is '1'. Then we add 1: '1' + 1 = '2'. Then the string for step3 is \"2\".\n\n   If `ans` is 9, then the string is \"9\". Then '9' + 1 is 58 (in ASCII) which is the character ':'. Then the third program will see the string \":\". Then the frequency of ':' is 1 -> oddCount=1 -> output \"First\".\n\nBut note: the second program in Java: \n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n   This does: (s.charAt(0) is a char, then adding 1 promotes it to int, then we do (int) and then print as char.\n\n   In C, we do the same: take the first char, add 1, and then we get a char? But we are storing it in a char array. However, note: the value might exceed 127? But the input to the first program is an integer, and the output is a long which is positive. The string representation is digits, so the first char is between '0' and '9'. Then adding 1 gives between '1' and ':' (which is 58).\n\n   So we are safe.\n\nSteps in C:\n\n1. Read an integer `n`.\n2. Compute `ans` (as a long) for the first step.\n3. Convert `ans` to a string. (We need to allocate a buffer: the maximum number of digits in a long is about 20.)\n4. Take the first character of that string, add 1, and form a new string of one character (and null terminator).\n5. For the third step, count the frequency of each character in that string (which is one character) and then compute oddCount.\n6. Print \"First\" or \"Second\" based on the condition.\n\nBut note: what if the first step produces an empty string? That cannot happen because n>=1? The first program: n is read as an integer. The problem does not specify the range, but the original program uses `n = sc.nextInt()`. We assume at least 1? But to be safe, we should check that the string representation of `ans` is non-empty? But if n=0, then the loop runs from 1 to 0? Actually, the loop condition: `i < n+1` and if n=0, then n+1=1, so i from 1 to 1? Then i=1: then n/i = 0/1? Actually, if n=0, then the loop runs for i=1? Then n/i = 0. Then ans=0. Then string \"0\". Then first char '0' -> becomes '1'. Then step3: string \"1\" -> oddCount=1 -> First.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the input constraints. We follow the same as the Java.\n\nImplementation:\n\nWe'll use:\n\n    long ans = 0;\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        long t = n / i;   // integer division\n        ans += (long)i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n    }\n\nThen convert `ans` to a string. We can use `snprintf`.\n\n    char buffer[50]; // enough for a long\n    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%ld\", ans);\n\nThen step2:\n\n    char c = buffer[0] + 1;\n    char nextStr[2] = { c, '\\0' };\n\nThen step3:\n\n    int freq[256] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n    for (int i = 0; nextStr[i]; i++) {\n        freq[(unsigned char)(nextStr[i])]++;\n    }\n    int oddCount = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n            oddCount++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n    }\n\nBut note: the condition in the third program is: \n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\n   This is the same condition.\n\nHowever, note: the third program in Java uses `Map` and iterates over the string. We do the same with the frequency array.\n\nBut note: the third program counts the frequency of each character. We do the same.\n\nBut what about non-ASCII? The original Java program uses `char` which is 16-bit, but the input is from the second program which outputs a single byte? Actually, the second program outputs a single character using `%c`, which is one byte. And the third program reads a string of one byte. So we are safe.\n\nNow, let's write the entire C program.\n\nNote: We must not include any extra I/O. Only the first step reads from stdin (the integer n). The last step writes to stdout (either \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nWe assume the input n is a positive integer? The Java programs don't check, so we don't either.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nEdge: if the string representation of `ans` is empty? Then buffer[0] is '\\0'. Then we do `'\\0' + 1` which is 1, then the string becomes a string with the first character being 1 (which is the SOH character). Then step3: we count that character (which is non-zero) and then oddCount=1 -> First.\n\nBut `ans` is at least 0. When n=0, then ans=0 -> string \"0\". So no empty string.\n\nSo the C program:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n2. Compute ans as in the first Java program.\n3. Convert ans to a string.\n4. Extract the first character, add 1, and form a new string of one character.\n5. Count frequencies of the new string (which has one character).\n6. Count the number of characters that have odd frequency (which will be 1, unless the same character appears multiple times? But the string is one char, so one time).\n7. Then check condition: if oddCount<=1 or oddCount is odd -> print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nBut note: the condition is \"if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\".\n\nWe write accordingly.\n\nNow, let's code."
