  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single C program.\n The first program reads a string and outputs \"Yes\" if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', otherwise \"No\".\n The second program reads a line of space separated tokens and outputs the index (1-indexed) of the first occurrence of \"0\".\n The third program reads a string of binary digits and computes a dynamic programming problem.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is executed in order: the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads a string S (from stdin) and outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n 2. The second program reads the output of the first (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and then splits it by space? \n    But note: the second program expects a line of space separated tokens. However, the output of the first is a single word (with no space in \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n    Then it counts the tokens until it finds the token \"0\". But note: the output of the first is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", neither contains \"0\". \n    Therefore, the second program will not break until it has processed all tokens (only one token) and then outputs 1 (because it counts the tokens until it breaks on \"0\", but since no token is \"0\", it doesn't break until the loop ends naturally? Actually, the break condition is when it finds \"0\". Since it doesn't find \"0\", it will count the entire array? Then it outputs the count which is 1?).\n\n    Actually, the second program does:\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        Then it iterates over each token. For each token, it increments result (which starts at 0) by 1, and if the token is \"0\", it breaks.\n\n    So if the input to the second program is \"Yes\", then the array is [\"Yes\"] -> no \"0\", so result becomes 1 (because one token) and then it breaks out of the loop? Actually, no: the break is inside the if that checks for \"0\". Since the token is not \"0\", it doesn't break. Then it moves to the next token? There is none. Then it prints 1.\n\n    Similarly, for \"No\": same thing, one token -> result=1.\n\n 3. Then the third program reads the output of the second (which is \"1\") as a string? Actually, the third program reads a string of binary digits. But the input is \"1\", which is a binary digit? Yes, it is. Then it will run the DP on the string \"1\".\n\n However, note the original chain:\n\n   Input to the first program: let's say we give the first program the string \"ABA\" (which contains both A and B -> outputs \"Yes\")\n   Then the second program gets \"Yes\" -> outputs 1.\n   Then the third program gets \"1\" -> and then computes the DP for the string \"1\".\n\n But what if the first program outputs \"No\"? Then the second program outputs 1, and the third program gets \"1\" as well.\n\n So the output of the entire chain is the output of the third program for the input string \"1\".\n\n However, wait: the first program's input is arbitrary? The problem states: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we start with the same initial input? And then the output of each program becomes the input of the next.\n\n Therefore, we must:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (a string) for the first program.\n   Step 2: Process it as the first program: check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Then we don't output, but we remember the string that would have been output: either \"Yes\" or \"No\". This becomes the input to the second program.\n\n   Step 3: The second program: split the string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") by space -> one token. Then we count the tokens until we see a token \"0\". Since we don't have \"0\", we count the entire array (one token). So the result is 1. This becomes the input to the third program as a string? Actually, the second program outputs the integer 1 (via pw.println(result)), so the next program gets the string \"1\".\n\n   Step 4: The third program: takes the string \"1\" and runs the DP. Then outputs the result.\n\n But note: what if the first program's input string does not contain both? Then the first program outputs \"No\", and the second program still outputs 1.\n\n Therefore, the input to the third program is always \"1\", regardless of the initial input? That seems odd. But that's the chain.\n\n However, let me check the second program: it breaks on \"0\". What if the output of the first program was \"0\"? Then the second program would break at the first token and output 1? But the first program never outputs \"0\". It outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program always outputs 1.\n\n Therefore, the third program always gets the string \"1\". So the entire chain always outputs the same thing: the result of the third program for the input \"1\".\n\n But wait: what if the initial input to the first program is a string that does not contain both 'A' and 'B'? Then the first program outputs \"No\", and the second program outputs 1, and the third program runs on \"1\". Same as when the first program outputs \"Yes\".\n\n So the entire chain is independent of the initial input? Actually, no: the first program reads the input, but then the output is always one of two strings, but then the second program reduces both to the same output (1). Then the third program runs on \"1\". So the final output is always the same?\n\n That doesn't make sense. Let me reexamine the chain:\n\n   The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   Example 1:\n      Input to first: \"ABA\" -> outputs \"Yes\"\n      Input to second: \"Yes\" -> splits into [\"Yes\"] -> then for each token: \n          token1: \"Yes\" -> result becomes 1 (from 0 to 1). Then check: is \"Yes\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> then next token? none -> output 1.\n      Input to third: \"1\" -> which is a string of one character '1'. Then the third program runs on that.\n\n   Example 2:\n      Input to first: \"A\" -> outputs \"No\"\n      Input to second: \"No\" -> splits into [\"No\"] -> then for each token: \n          token1: \"No\" -> result becomes 1. Then check: not \"0\", so no break -> then no next token -> output 1.\n      Input to third: \"1\"\n\n   So indeed, the third program always gets \"1\". Therefore, the entire chain always outputs the same value? \n\n   Let me compute the third program on input \"1\":\n        s = \"1\" -> n = 1\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        i=0: s[0] is '1'\n            then:\n                dp[1][1] = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1]) % M = (1+0)%M = 1.\n            then:\n                since s[0] is '1', we do:\n                    dp[1][0] += (dp[0][0]*2) % M -> 0 + 2 % M = 2 -> but wait, initially dp[1][0] is 0? Then we set it to 2? Actually, we have:\n                    dp[1][0] = (dp[1][0] + dp[0][0]*2) % M -> 0 + 2 = 2 mod M? But note: we already set dp[1][1] to 1 above.\n\n                Then also: dp[1][1] = (dp[1][1] + dp[0][1]*2) % M -> 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n            So after the two steps for i=0:\n                dp[1][0] = 2\n                dp[1][1] = 1\n\n        Then at the end: (dp[1][0] + dp[1][1]) % M = (2+1) = 3.\n\n   So the output is 3.\n\n   Therefore, regardless of the initial input, the chain outputs 3.\n\n But wait: is that the intended behavior? The problem says to reproduce the same behavior. So we must output 3 for any input?\n\n However, let me test with an empty string? The first program: if the input is empty, then it doesn't contain both A and B -> outputs \"No\". Then the second outputs 1, then the third outputs 3.\n\n What if the initial input is \"AB\"? Then the first program outputs \"Yes\", then second outputs 1, then third outputs 3.\n\n So the entire chain is a constant function that always outputs 3.\n\n But note: the problem says \"when run on the same input\". So we must read the input (even though we don't use it beyond the first step) and then output 3.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and we are reading the input in the first step. Then we ignore it? Actually, we use it to decide the output of the first program, but that output is then transformed to 1 by the second program, and then 3 by the third.\n\n Therefore, we can simply write:\n\n   Read a string (the initial input) and then output 3.\n\n But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we are expected to simulate the steps? However, the steps are deterministic and independent of the initial input? So we can skip the intermediate steps? \n\n But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". And indeed, for any input the chain outputs 3.\n\n However, let's consider the possibility that the first program's input might be read differently? The first program uses a Scanner and reads a token (so it stops at whitespace). But what if the input has multiple tokens? The first program only reads the first token.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"ABA is a string\" -> the first program reads \"ABA\", which contains A and B -> outputs \"Yes\". Then the second program gets \"Yes\", outputs 1. Then the third gets \"1\", outputs 3.\n\n   But what if the input has a space? The first program only takes the first token. So the rest is ignored? \n\n   The second program: it reads a whole line? Actually, the first program writes a whole line (with println). Then the second program reads a whole line. The first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\" and then a newline? So the second program reads exactly that one word (without any extra spaces). \n\n   Therefore, the entire chain only depends on the first token of the initial input.\n\n   But note: the first program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token (so if the input is \"A B\", then the first token is \"A\", which does not contain both A and B? Actually, the string \"A\" does not contain both A and B? It contains A but not B -> so outputs \"No\". Then the chain outputs 3.\n\n   However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must read the first token and then output 3.\n\n   But wait: what if the input token for the first program is \"0\"? Then the first program: the string \"0\" does not contain both 'A' and 'B' -> outputs \"No\". Then the chain outputs 3.\n\n   So the entire chain is:\n\n        Read a token (ignoring the rest of the input) and output 3.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are producing only one output at the end.\n\n   Therefore, the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            char s[100]; // or any reasonable size; we don't know the maximum, but we only need to read one token\n            scanf(\"%s\", s); // read the first token, ignore the rest\n\n            // Then we don't do anything with s? Because the chain always outputs 3.\n            printf(\"3\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n But wait: what if the input is very long? We only read the first token. We don't care about the rest.\n\n However, the original first program only reads the first token. The rest of the input is not read. Then the second program reads a line from the output of the first, which is a single line. The third program then reads the output of the second (a single integer on a line). \n\n So in our C program, we only need to read the first token (and then ignore the rest of the input? Actually, the rest of the input might cause problems? But note: the original first program only reads the first token. The second program does not read from the original input but from the output of the first. Similarly, the third program reads from the output of the second.\n\n Therefore, we don't have to worry about the rest of the input. We read one token and then output 3.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". But the intermediate steps are constant. So we can optimize.\n\n But to be safe and follow the instructions, we should simulate the steps? However, the problem says: \"without I/O\" in the middle. So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: read the token (as the first program does).\n        Step 2: check if the token contains both 'A' and 'B'. Then we have a string \"Yes\" or \"No\". (But we don't output it, we just use it for the next step).\n        Step 3: for the second program: we split the string (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") by space -> one token. Then we traverse the tokens until we find \"0\", but we don't. Then the result is 1.\n        Step 4: for the third program: we take the string \"1\" (the integer 1 converted to a string? Actually, the second program outputs the integer 1, but we are passing it as a string? In the chain, the output of the second is the integer 1 printed as a string (so \"1\\n\"?). The third program reads the entire line and then converts it to a char array? But note the third program uses `sc.nextLine()`, so it reads the entire line. Then we run the DP on the string \"1\".\n\n        But note: the third program expects a string of binary digits? The string \"1\" is a valid binary digit.\n\n        Then we compute the DP for the string \"1\" and output the result (which is 3).\n\n However, we can precompute that the third program for input \"1\" outputs 3. So we can just output 3.\n\n But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". And the behavior is: for any input string (at least the first token) the output is 3.\n\n Therefore, the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            // We read the first token to mimic the first program's input reading.\n            char token[101]; // allocate enough space\n            scanf(\"%100s\", token); // read up to 100 characters\n\n            // The rest of the chain is constant: output 3.\n            printf(\"3\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n However, what if the token is longer than 100? We read only 100. The original Java program would read the next token (without a length limit? but in practice, it can be as long as the memory allows). But in C, we must set a limit. We can set a larger limit? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n But note: the third program's input is fixed to \"1\", so we don't need to store a huge token. We only need to read the first token to mimic the first program.\n\n Alternatively, we can skip storing it? But we must read at least the first token to avoid leaving it in the buffer? Because if we don't read it, then the next input operation would read it? But the problem says only the first block should handle reading input. And we are going to output 3. So we can read the first token and then ignore it.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the maximum length. We can use:\n\n        char c;\n        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && c != ' ' && c != '\\n' && c != '\\t') {\n            // we are just consuming the token, but we don't store it.\n        }\n\n But the first program in Java uses Scanner.next() which reads a token (defined by the scanner's delimiter, which is whitespace). We can read until we hit whitespace or EOF. However, we don't need the content? Actually, we do: the first program checks if the token contains both 'A' and 'B'. But then we don't use the result? Because regardless, the chain outputs 3.\n\n Therefore, we can skip the check? But note: the chain is fixed. The check is done, but then the result of the check is transformed by the second program to 1 regardless. So we don't need to do the check? We only need to read the token to mimic the input consumption.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program is to read the next token. So we must read the token. But we don't care about its content? Then we can simply read the first token (without storing) and then output 3.\n\n But what if the token is very long? We don't want to crash. We can read until we get a whitespace without storing.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are not required to do the same operations? We are required to produce the same output. And the output is always 3.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n        // Skip the first token: we read until whitespace or EOF\n        int c;\n        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {\n            if (c == ' ' || c == '\\n' || c == '\\t') \n                break;\n        }\n\n        printf(\"3\\n\");\n\n But wait: what about the rest of the input? The original first program only reads the first token. The rest of the input is not read? Then the second program reads from the output of the first, not from the original input. So the rest of the input is never read? \n\n        Example: if the input is \"token1 token2 token3\", the first program reads \"token1\", then the second program would normally read from the output of the first (which is a separate stream). So the original input stream still has \" token2 token3\". But the second program doesn't read from the original input? It reads from the output of the first program. Then the third program reads from the output of the second. So the rest of the input is left unread.\n\n        In our C program, we have only one input stream. We must leave the rest unread? Because the original chain does not read beyond the first token? Actually, the first program only reads the first token. The rest of the input is not consumed by any program? \n\n        However, the second program in the chain reads from the output of the first, not from the original input. Similarly, the third program reads from the output of the second. Therefore, the original input stream beyond the first token is never read.\n\n        So in our C program, we only read the first token and leave the rest. But note: the problem doesn't specify what to do with the rest. We are only concerned with the output.\n\n        But what if the input is huge? We don't want to read the entire input. We only want to read the first token.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                // Read the first token: we read until we hit whitespace or EOF.\n                int c;\n                while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && !isspace(c)) {\n                    // do nothing, just consume the token\n                }\n\n                // Now, we output 3.\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, this does not check for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'? But the chain output is 3 regardless. So we don't need to check? \n\n        But what if the problem expects the program to have the same memory behavior? The first program in Java stores the token. But we don't. But the problem says \"behaves identically\" meaning same output for the same input? \n\n        Since the output is always 3, we can skip the check.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are allowed to optimize? But the intermediate steps are fixed. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do the check? But then we don't use the result. So we can skip.\n\n        But let me think: what if the token is empty? The first program: in.next() would read an empty token? Actually, the Scanner by default skips whitespace. So the first non-whitespace token. If the input is empty, then the first program would wait? Or if the input is only whitespace, then the first program would block? \n\n        Our C program: if the input is empty, the while loop condition: c = getchar() returns EOF -> we break and output 3.\n\n        The first program in Java: if the input is empty, then in.next() would throw an exception? But the problem doesn't specify. We assume non-empty input? \n\n        The problem says: \"the entire sequence\", so we must handle the same inputs. The original first program expects a non-empty token? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n        To be safe, we can mimic the first program: if there is no token, then the first program would have failed? But we are told that the chain is run on the same input. We assume the input is as expected by the first program: at least one token.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply read the first token (by consuming until whitespace) and output 3.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the input. We'll assume that the input has at least one token.\n\n        But note: the first program in Java: if there is no token, then the program would block? Or throw an exception? We don't know. But the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input is empty, then the Java program would throw a NoSuchElementException? Then our C program should do what? \n\n        The problem doesn't specify error handling. We assume the input has at least one token.\n\n        Therefore, the final C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int c;\n                // Skip whitespace\n                while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && isspace(c));\n                // If we found a non-whitespace, then we consume the rest of the token until next whitespace or EOF\n                if (c != EOF) {\n                    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && !isspace(c));\n                }\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        This handles the empty input? If the input is empty, then the first while loop breaks at EOF, then we skip the token consumption. Then output 3.\n\n        But the first program in Java on empty input: \n            Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n            String s = in.next(); -> throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.\n\n        Our C program does not throw an exception. It outputs 3. \n\n        So we must also mimic the exception? The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". If the input is empty, the chain crashes? Then our C program should also crash? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and the example programs are given. We are to translate the sequence. The example programs assume non-empty input? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the original programs are written for contest problems (which have non-empty input), we assume non-empty input.\n\n        Alternatively, to be safe, we can do:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int c = getchar();\n                // Skip leading whitespace\n                while (c != EOF && isspace(c)) {\n                    c = getchar();\n                }\n                if (c == EOF) {\n                    // The input has no token -> the first program would throw an exception.\n                    // We don't know what to output? But the problem says the chain is run on the same input.\n                    // Since the original chain would crash, we can output nothing? or an error?\n                    // But the problem says: the last block should handle output. And the chain crashed in the first block.\n                    // We are not required to handle errors? The problem assumes valid input?\n                    // We'll output nothing and return non-zero? \n                    // However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The original chain crashes -> our program should crash.\n                    // We can exit with an error.\n                    fprintf(stderr, \"Error: no token found\\n\");\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                // Consume the rest of the token\n                while (c != EOF && !isspace(c)) {\n                    c = getchar();\n                }\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But the original chain: the first program might crash and not produce any output to the next program? Then the second program would get nothing? and then crash? Then the third program wouldn't run. The entire chain crashes.\n\n        We are not required to mimic crashes? The problem says \"behaves identically\" for the same input? If the input is empty, the chain crashes -> we crash. If the input is non-empty, we output 3.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify error handling. Since the contest problems usually have non-empty input, we assume non-empty.\n\n        We'll write the program without error handling for empty input? Because the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and the sequence of programs are provided. The example inputs in the contest would be non-empty.\n\n        Therefore, we'll write:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                // Skip leading whitespace\n                int c;\n                do {\n                    c = getchar();\n                } while (c != EOF && isspace(c));\n\n                // If we got a non-whitespace, then we consume the rest of the token\n                if (c != EOF) {\n                    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && !isspace(c));\n                }\n\n                // Then output 3\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But note: what if the input has multiple lines? The first program only reads the first token. The rest of the input (including newlines) is left. Our program leaves the rest. That matches.\n\n        However, the above program does not check for empty input? It will output 3 even if the input is empty? \n\n        But the first program in Java: if the input is empty, then in.next() throws an exception. We are not mimicking that.\n\n        We have two options:\n\n          Option 1: Assume non-empty input (as the problem likely intends) and output 3.\n\n          Option 2: Mimic the crash on empty input.\n\n        The problem does not specify. But note: the second program in the chain expects to read a line. If the first program crashes, then the second program would not get any input? So the chain breaks.\n\n        How would the chain be executed? Probably in a shell:\n\n            $ java -cp ... atcoder_ABC158_A | java -cp ... atcoder_ABC170_A | java -cp ... atcoder_ABC129_E\n\n        If the first program crashes, it produces no output? Then the second program would read EOF? Then the second program: br.readLine() returns null -> then split would throw a NullPointerException? Then the second program crashes. Then the third program gets no input? Then it crashes.\n\n        We are to write a single C program. We don't have pipes. We are reading from stdin. If the input is empty, we should crash? Or output 3? \n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\". So for empty input, the original chain crashes -> we should crash.\n\n        But the problem does not specify how the chain is executed. We are writing a single program. We can decide:\n\n            - If the input is empty (no non-whitespace), then we return an error (non-zero) without outputting 3.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int c;\n                // Skip whitespace\n                while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && isspace(c));\n                if (c == EOF) {\n                    // No token -> error\n                    fprintf(stderr, \"No token found\\n\");\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                // Consume the rest of the token\n                while (c != EOF && !isspace(c)) {\n                    c = getchar();\n                }\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But the original first program in Java throws an exception that prints a stack trace to stderr? We are printing a message? The problem does not require the same error message, just the same behavior (crash for empty input, and 3 for non-empty).\n\n        We can simply crash without a message? But the problem doesn't specify. We'll do:\n\n            if (c == EOF) {\n                return 1;\n            }\n\n        However, the contest problems usually specify the input. We assume non-empty.\n\n        Given the above, and to keep it simple (since the sample inputs are non-empty), we'll assume non-empty input and output 3.\n\n        Final decision: output 3 for any input that has at least one token. For empty input, we output 3 as well? Actually, our first version for empty input would break the while and then output 3. But that's not the same as the chain.\n\n        We have to be consistent: the chain crashes for empty input -> we crash. But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must crash for empty input.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int c;\n                // Skip whitespace\n                c = getchar();\n                while (c != EOF && isspace(c)) {\n                    c = getchar();\n                }\n                if (c == EOF) {\n                    // This corresponds to no token -> error\n                    // We mimic the Java program's behavior by returning an error code.\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                // Read the rest of the token\n                while (c != EOF && !isspace(c)) {\n                    c = getchar();\n                }\n                printf(\"3\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But note: what if the input is only one non-whitespace character? Then the first getchar() reads that character, then the second while reads the next which is EOF or whitespace? Then we break.\n\n        This program will output 3 for any non-empty token and crash (return 1) for empty input.\n\n        However, the first program in Java does not crash for input that has a token? It only crashes for no token.\n\n        Therefore, we are mimicking that.\n\n        But wait: the first program in Java also crashes if there is an I/O error? We are not handling that. We assume normal input.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem likely assumes non-empty input, and to keep the code simple, we can assume non-empty input. The problem does not specify, but the sample inputs in contests are non-empty.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the chain always outputs 3 for any input that provides at least one token, and crashes for empty input. Since the problem says \"when run on the same input\", we must crash for empty input.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the input domain. We'll write the program to crash for empty input.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and the first block is the only one that reads input. Our program reads input and then either crashes or continues.\n\n        So we'll do as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", and if the input is empty, the chain crashes -> we crash. For non-empty, we output 3.\n\n        Therefore, the final C program:"
