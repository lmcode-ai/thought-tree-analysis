We do the same. This program should be correct. However, we must test with a sample input. Sample input for the first program (that outputs \"YES\"):\n\n  3\n  1 2 1\n\n  Then the frequency: \n      1:2, 2:1 -> max=2.\n      n=3 (odd): condition: max<= (3/2)+1 -> 2<= (1+1)=2 -> true -> \"YES\"\n\n  Then the chain: second program -> \"YES\", third program -> 0. Sample input for \"NO\":\n\n  3\n  1 1 1\n\n  Then max=3, condition: 3<= 3/2+1 -> 3<= 1+1=2 -> false -> \"NO\"\n\n  Then output 0. So the program outputs 0 in both cases. But we can also test with a non-binary string that has adjacent duplicates? But our string is fixed.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. The first program (codeforces_296_A) reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It counts the frequency of each number (in an array of size 1001) and then checks if the maximum frequency is at most ceil(n/2). It outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces every comma with a space.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC124_C) reads a string of '0's and '1's. It then calculates the minimum number of changes required so that no two adjacent characters are the same. It does this by trying two approaches: one from left to right and one from right to left, and then takes the minimum of the two.\n\nHowever, note that the entire sequence is executed in order. The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is a string. The second program reads a string and replaces commas. However, the output of the first program does not contain any commas? So the second program would replace commas (if any) with spaces. But the output of the first is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without commas). So the second program would output the same string? Then the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's, but it gets either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is not binary. This doesn't make sense.\n\nThis indicates that the programs are not meant to be chained arbitrarily. We must reconsider the problem statement: we are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nHowever, the three programs are independent and were originally written for different problems. The problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\", meaning we have to simulate the chain.\n\nBut the inputs and outputs of these programs are not compatible? Let's look again:\n\nFirst program: \n  Input: first integer n, then n integers.\n  Output: either \"YES\" or \"NO\"\n\nSecond program:\n  Input: a string (that may contain commas) and replaces commas by spaces.\n  Output: the same string with commas replaced by spaces.\n\nThird program:\n  Input: a string of '0's and '1's.\n  Output: an integer (the minimum number of changes).\n\nHow do we chain them? The first program outputs a string (without commas) so when passed to the second program, it will just output the same string. Then the third program gets \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is not a string of binary digits. This would break.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that the chain is intended to run on the same initial input? But the first program requires integers and the second requires a string with commas? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not linear? Or maybe the problem is that we have three separate programs and we are to run them in sequence, but the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program, and then the output of the first is fed to the second, and then to the third. And the final output is the output of the third.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n  Input to chain: the input for the first program (which is an integer n and then n integers).\n\n  Step 1: Run first program on that input -> produces either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n  Step 2: Run second program on the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" -> produces the same string (since there are no commas) -> \"YES\" becomes \"YES\", \"NO\" becomes \"NO\".\n  Step 3: Run third program on the string \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n\nBut the third program expects a string of '0' and '1'. It will then try to process \"YES\" (which is 'Y','E','S') and then do the flipping. This doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that the chain as given is not meaningful. However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must assume that the chain is fixed and we have to implement the three steps as described.\n\nAlternatively, note: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". So we have to trust the chain. But in reality, the second program is designed for a specific input (with commas) and the third for a binary string. \n\nLooking at the original problems:\n\n- First program: Codeforces 296 A - Yaroslav and Permutations\n  It checks if it is possible to rearrange the array so that no two adjacent numbers are equal. The condition is that no number appears more than ceil(n/2) times.\n\n- Second program: Atcoder ABC051 A - Haiku\n  It simply replaces commas in a string with spaces.\n\n- Third program: Atcoder ABC124 C - Coloring Colorfully\n  It flips some bits so that adjacent bits are alternating. It counts the minimum flips.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is a string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") and that is passed to the second program. The second program replaces commas. Since there are no commas, it just passes the string. Then the third program processes that string. The third program is designed for a binary string, but now we are giving it \"YES\" or \"NO\". This will produce an arbitrary result.\n\nThis chain is not meaningful. However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We have to mimic the chain exactly.\n\nSo we must write a C program that:\n\n1. Reads the input for the first program: an integer n and then n integers.\n2. Processes as the first program: counts the frequency and then outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (but we don't output it, we pass it to the next step).\n3. Then the second program: takes the string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") and replaces any commas (there are none) so it remains the same.\n4. Then the third program: takes that string and then does:\n   - It has two methods: \n        a. Traverse from left to right: if the current char is same as the previous, flip the current and count.\n        b. Traverse from right to left: if the current char is same as the next, flip the current and count.\n   - Then output the minimum of the two counts.\n\nBut note: the string in the third program is either \"YES\" (3 characters) or \"NO\" (2 characters). The flipping operations will be:\n\nFor \"YES\":\n  Original: 'Y','E','S'\n\n  Method 1 (left to right):\n      i=1: compare a[0]='Y' and a[1]='E' -> different -> do nothing.\n      i=2: compare a[1]='E' and a[2]='S' -> different -> do nothing.\n      So a1 = 0.\n\n  Method 2 (right to left):\n      i=1: compare b[1]='E' and b[0]='Y' -> different -> do nothing.\n      i=0: stop? (since we start from the end and go to index 1, but the loop is from i = len-1 down to 1? Actually the loop in the third program is for i from (x.length()-1) down to 1: so for a string of length 3, i=2 and i=1.\n          i=2: compare b[2] and b[1]: 'S' and 'E' -> different -> do nothing.\n          i=1: compare b[1] and b[0]: 'E' and 'Y' -> different -> do nothing.\n      So a2 = 0.\n\n  Then output 0.\n\nFor \"NO\":\n  Length=2: \n      Method 1: \n          i=1: compare a[0]='N' and a[1]='O' -> different -> do nothing -> a1=0.\n      Method 2:\n          i=1: compare b[1]='O' and b[0]='N' -> different -> do nothing -> a2=0.\n      Then output 0.\n\nSo the entire chain would output 0 for any input that leads to \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n\nBut wait, the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and then the chain ends with 0? That doesn't seem useful.\n\nGiven the confusion, I suspect that the chain is not intended to be run on the same input. Alternatively, the problem might be that we have to run the three programs independently on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\". And \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we have to design:\n\n  Read the input once (for the first program).\n  Then process the first program (without output, just store the result string in memory).\n  Then pass that string to the second program (which then processes it and produces a string, again stored in memory).\n  Then pass that string to the third program (which then produces an integer, which we output).\n\nBut note: the first program originally reads integers, but the second and third read strings. The initial input is integers. So we read the integers, then the first program does its work and produces a string. Then the second program takes that string and outputs a string (with commas replaced, but there are none). Then the third program takes that string and outputs an integer.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n  Input: as described for the first program (n and n integers)\n  Output: an integer (which is 0 for both \"YES\" and \"NO\", as we saw above)\n\nThis is the behavior we have to replicate.\n\nBut note: the third program is designed for a binary string. However, we are feeding it \"YES\" or \"NO\". So we must run the third program exactly as it is on the string \"YES\" or \"NO\". The result is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain will always output 0? \n\nBut that cannot be, because the first program outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" conditionally. However, the third program doesn't care about the meaning, it just processes the string as a sequence of characters. And in both cases, adjacent characters are different? \n\nLet's check:\n\n  \"YES\": \n      Y and E -> different\n      E and S -> different\n  \"NO\":\n      N and O -> different\n\nSo indeed, the string \"YES\" and \"NO\" have no two adjacent equal characters. Therefore, the third program will output 0.\n\nSo the entire chain will always output 0? \n\nBut then why run the first program? The output is always 0 regardless of the input? \n\nThis is the behavior we must replicate: we read the input of the first program, then we output 0.\n\nHowever, note that the first program might not be the only one that reads from stdin? Actually, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" So we read all the input at the beginning.\n\nBut wait, the second program and third program in the chain are designed to read from stdin? But in the chain, they are reading the output of the previous program. We are simulating the chain without I/O in between. So we must capture the output of the first program as a string and pass it to the second program, and then capture the output of the second as a string and pass it to the third.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the integer n, then n integers.\n  Step 2: Compute the frequency array and check the condition (as in the first Java program). We get a string: either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n  Step 3: Pass this string to the second program: which replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, we get the same string.\n  Step 4: Pass the string (which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\") to the third program. The third program then processes the string to count the minimum flips. We saw that in both cases the result is 0.\n\nBut note: the third Java program does:\n\n  It creates two copies: a and b of the string.\n  Then for a (left to right):\n      for i from 1 to len-1:\n          if a[i] == a[i-1] then flip a[i] and count++.\n\n  For b (right to left):\n      for i from len-1 down to 1:\n          if b[i] == b[i-1] then flip b[i-1] and count++.\n\n  Then output the minimum of the two counts.\n\nIn our case, the string is \"YES\" (3 characters) or \"NO\" (2 characters). In both, there are no adjacent duplicates? So no flips -> counts are 0.\n\nSo the entire chain always outputs 0.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  Read n and the n integers (we can ignore the integers after reading n? because we only care about the condition, but we have to read them to avoid breaking the input).\n\nBut we have to compute the condition to know if we would have produced \"YES\" or \"NO\", but then we don't use that string for anything else? because the third program always outputs 0. However, we must replicate the chain exactly.\n\nBut note: the third program does not depend on the content of the string in a way that changes the output? It only depends on the adjacent characters. Since both \"YES\" and \"NO\" have no adjacent duplicates, the output is 0.\n\nSo we can skip the condition? Actually no, because we must read the integers to avoid leaving them in the input for the next programs? But the chain is: the first program reads the entire input (n and n integers). Then the next two programs read the output of the previous program, which are strings. So we must read the integers.\n\nBut we don't actually need to compute the condition? Because regardless of the condition, we are going to output 0. However, the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must do the same computations.\n\nBut note: the first program does:\n\n  int[] array = new int[1001];\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      int index = in.nextInt();\n      array[index]++;\n  }\n  ... then checks the maximum frequency.\n\nSo we have to do that. Then we get a string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and then we pass it through the second and third programs.\n\nBut the third program will output 0 regardless.\n\nSo the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read n.\n  Step 2: Read n integers and count frequencies (for numbers in [0,1000]? note: the array is of size 1001, indices 0..1000).\n  Step 3: Compute the maximum frequency (countMax).\n  Step 4: Check the condition (but we don't use the result to branch the output, because we are not going to output the string, we are going to pass it to the next step and then the next step always yields 0). However, we must form the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" to pass to the next step? \n\nBut note: the next step (second program) only replaces commas. So we can form the string, but then we don't actually use it for anything else? because the third program will output 0 regardless of the string? \n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs \"NO\" and the string is \"NO\", which is two characters. The third program does:\n\n  a1: for i=1: compare a[0] and a[1] -> 'N' and 'O' -> not equal -> nothing. So a1=0.\n  a2: for i=1: (since the string length is 2) we do i=1: compare b[1] and b[0] -> 'O' and 'N' -> not equal -> nothing. So a2=0.\n\nThen min=0.\n\nSimilarly for \"YES\": 3 characters, but no adjacent duplicates -> 0.\n\nSo the output is always 0.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  Read n and the n integers, compute the frequency, and then do nothing with the result (because the chain's final output is 0).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must do the same steps. So we have to form the string and then run the second and third programs on it.\n\nHowever, note: the third program might have different behavior if the string had adjacent duplicates? But we know the strings \"YES\" and \"NO\" do not. So we can skip the actual flipping? \n\nBut to be safe, we will simulate the third program on the string we get.\n\nPlan:\n\n  Step 1: Read n, then n integers. Store the integers and compute frequency for numbers from 0 to 1000.\n  Step 2: Compute the maximum frequency (countMax). Then form a string:\n          if (n % 2 == 0) {\n              if (countMax <= n/2) -> then string = \"YES\";\n              else -> string = \"NO\";\n          } else {\n              if (countMax <= n/2+1) -> then string = \"YES\";\n              else -> string = \"NO\";\n          }\n  Step 3: Apply the second program: replace commas in the string with spaces. Since there are no commas, the string remains the same.\n  Step 4: Apply the third program on this string:\n          Let s = the string from step 3.\n          We create two temporary arrays (or we can simulate the flips without modifying the string? but note the Java program modifies copies) and count the flips.\n\n          However, note: the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which we know has no adjacent duplicates. Therefore, the counts will be 0. But let's code it for any string? because the problem says to chain.\n\n          How the third program works:\n            We have two methods: \n            a. Forward: \n                a1 = 0\n                copy = s (we'll use an array of chars for the forward pass)\n                for i from 1 to len-1:\n                    if copy[i] == copy[i-1]:\n                         flip the current char (if it's '0' make it '1', else '0')? But wait, the Java program flips to the opposite? However, our string is \"YES\" and \"NO\", which are not binary. The Java program was designed for '0' and '1', but it uses:\n                         if (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else to '1'. \n\n          But our string contains letters. The flip operation would be: \n            if the current char is '1' -> becomes '0'\n            otherwise becomes '1'? \n\n          This is a problem: the third program is designed for binary strings. But we are giving it non-binary. \n\n          Let me check the Java program: \n\n            if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i - 1)) {\n                if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n                else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n                a1++;\n            }\n\n          So if the current char is not '1', it becomes '1'. But wait, it says: if it is '1' set to '0', otherwise set to '1'. \n\n          However, in the string \"YES\", the first two are 'Y' and 'E'. When i=1: \n             a[1] is 'E', a[0] is 'Y': they are not equal -> skip.\n          Then i=2: a[2] is 'S', a[1] is 'E': not equal -> skip.\n\n          So no flip. But what if we had two same letters? For example, if the string was \"EE\", then at i=1: \n             a[1]=='E' and a[0]=='E' -> equal.\n             Then because a.charAt(i) is 'E' (which is not '1'), so we set it to '1'. \n\n          So the flip operation is defined arbitrarily for non-binary? \n\n          This means that the third program is only defined for binary strings? But in the chain, we are giving it a non-binary string. \n\n          However, the problem says to chain the programs. So we must run the third program as it is on the string we have. \n\n          Therefore, we have to simulate the same flipping: \n            If two adjacent characters are the same, then flip the current one to the opposite (if it is '1' then to '0', otherwise to '1')? \n\n          But note: the third program in the chain is run on the output of the second program, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". And these strings do not have adjacent duplicates. So we won't flip. \n\n          Therefore, the count will be 0.\n\n  Step 5: Output the integer 0.\n\nSo the C program:\n\n  We read the integers and compute the frequency and form the string \"YES\" or \"NO\", then we run the third program on that string and output the result (which is 0).\n\nBut note: we must simulate the second program: replace commas. But there are none, so we can skip? But to be safe, we do the replacement (which does nothing).\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read input for the first program.\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      int array[1001] = {0}; // indices 0..1000\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          int num;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n          if (num >= 0 && num <= 1000) {\n              array[num]++;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 2: Compute the maximum frequency.\n      int countMax = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 1001; i++) {\n          if (array[i] > countMax) {\n              countMax = array[i];\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Form the string for the first program's output.\n      char s[4]; // \"YES\" is 3+null, \"NO\" is 2+null -> so 4 is enough.\n      if (n % 2 == 0) {\n          if (countMax <= n/2) {\n              strcpy(s, \"YES\");\n          } else {\n              strcpy(s, \"NO\");\n          }\n      } else {\n          if (countMax <= n/2+1) {\n              strcpy(s, \"YES\");\n          } else {\n              strcpy(s, \"NO\");\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 3: Apply the second program: replace commas with spaces.\n      // Since there are no commas, we just note the string remains the same.\n      // But we do the replacement: we traverse the string and replace ',' by ' '.\n      // We'll create a new string? or do in place? The original string is s.\n      char s2[4];\n      strcpy(s2, s); // we'll work on s2\n      for (int i = 0; s2[i]; i++) {\n          if (s2[i] == ',') {\n              s2[i] = ' ';\n          }\n      }\n      // Now s2 is the same as s.\n\n      // Step 4: Apply the third program on s2.\n      // We need to simulate the two methods.\n\n      int len = strlen(s2);\n      // We create two copies for the two methods.\n      char a[5]; // maximum length of s2 is 3 (for \"YES\") plus one for null, but we need to have an extra for safety? but we are not going beyond.\n      char b[5];\n      strcpy(a, s2);\n      strcpy(b, s2);\n\n      int a1 = 0;\n      // Forward: for i from 1 to len-1\n      for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\n          if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n              // flip a[i]: if it is '1' then set to '0', else set to '1'\n              if (a[i] == '1') {\n                  a[i] = '0';\n              } else {\n                  a[i] = '1';\n              }\n              a1++;\n          }\n      }\n\n      int a2 = 0;\n      // Backward: for i from len-1 down to 1\n      for (int i = len-1; i >= 1; i--) {\n          if (b[i] == b[i-1]) {\n              // flip b[i-1]: note the Java program flips the one at i-1? \n              // In the Java program: \n              //   if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) \n              //   then flip b[i-1] (because it sets at index i-1)\n              if (b[i-1] == '1') {\n                  b[i-1] = '0';\n              } else {\n                  b[i-1] = '1';\n              }\n              a2++;\n          }\n      }\n\n      int ans = (a1 < a2) ? a1 : a2;\n\n      // Step 5: Output the result of the third program.\n      printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the string we have is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which has no adjacent duplicates. Therefore, both a1 and a2 will be 0, so ans=0.\n\nHowever, what if the string had adjacent duplicates? The second program output might? But in our case, the second program output is the same as the first program's output, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\", and they don't have adjacent duplicates. So it's safe.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must write the program as above.\n\nBut note: the third program in the original Java uses StringBuilder and modifies the string. We are doing the same.\n\nHowever, we have to be cautious: the backward pass in the Java program flips the character at index i-1, and then the next comparisons use the flipped value? Actually, the Java program does:\n\n  for (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n      if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n          if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') \n              b.setCharAt(i-1, '0');\n          else \n              b.setCharAt(i-1, '1');\n          a2++;\n      }\n  }\n\nBut note: after flipping at index i-1, then when we go to the next (i-2), we compare the new b[i-1] (which is flipped) with b[i-2]. However, in our simulation, we are going from the end to the beginning, and we are modifying the array as we go. This might cause subsequent comparisons to use the flipped value. That is intended.\n\nBut in our case, the string has no adjacent duplicates, so we won't flip. So we are safe.\n\nBut if we had a string with adjacent duplicates, then our simulation would be correct.\n\nTherefore, we write the program as above.\n\nHowever, we can optimize: we know the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so we can skip the loops? But to be faithful, we do the loops.\n\nBut note: the third program might be run on any string? However, the string we have is fixed: \"YES\" or \"NO\". So we know the loops will run and not flip. So we can just set ans=0? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning we have to do the same operations. So we do the loops.\n\nLet me test with \"YES\":\n\n  Forward: \n      i=1: compare a[1] ('E') and a[0] ('Y') -> not equal -> skip.\n      i=2: compare a[2] ('S') and a[1] ('E') -> not equal -> skip.\n\n  Backward:\n      i=2: compare b[2] ('S') and b[1] ('E') -> not equal -> skip.\n      i=1: compare b[1] ('E') and b[0] ('Y') -> not equal -> skip.\n\n  So a1=0, a2=0 -> ans=0.\n\nWith \"NO\":\n\n  Forward:\n      i=1: compare a[1] ('O') and a[0] ('N') -> not equal -> skip.\n\n  Backward:\n      i=1: compare b[1] ('O') and b[0] ('N') -> not equal -> skip.\n\n  So again 0.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nBut note: the first program uses indices 1..1000? Actually, the frequency array is from 0 to 1000, and the numbers read can be any integer? But the problem says: the array is of size 1001. And the numbers are positive? The problem says: \"index = in.nextInt()\", and then array[index]++. So if the number is negative or above 1000, we get an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds? \n\nIn the Java program, the array is of size 1001, so indices 0..1000. If the input number is outside [0,1000], then it would crash. \n\nBut the problem statement for the original problem (Codeforces 296 A) says: the numbers are between 1 and 1000. So we are safe.\n\nBut to be safe, in C we have:\n\n  int array[1001] = {0};\n\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n      int num;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n      if (num >=0 && num <=1000) {\n          array[num]++;\n      }\n  }\n\nBut the problem says the numbers are between 1 and 1000, so we can skip the condition? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original Java program would crash if the number is not in [0,1000]? Actually, the array is of size 1001, so index 0..1000. If the number is 0, it is stored at index0. If the number is 1000, at index1000. If the number is 1001, then index1001 -> ArrayIndexOutOfBounds. Similarly negative.\n\nBut the problem says the numbers are between 1 and 1000. So we assume that.\n\nTherefore, we can remove the condition.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do:\n\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n      int num;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n      // The problem says the numbers are between 1 and 1000, so we assume that.\n      // If we get a number outside, we ignore? But the original program would crash.\n      // We must crash? But the problem doesn't say. However, the problem says the numbers are in [1,1000].\n      array[num]++;   // if num is not in [0,1000] then undefined behavior.\n  }\n\nWe assume the input is as expected.\n\nFinal code:\n\n  We'll do without condition.\n\nBut note: the original Java program does not check bounds? and if the input number is outside [0,1000], it will crash. Our C program would have undefined behavior (like writing to array[-1] or array[1001]). \n\nBut the problem says the input is the same as for the first program. So we assume the numbers are between 1 and 1000.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      int array[1001] = {0}; // indices 0..1000, initializes to 0.\n\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          int num;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n          // We assume 1<=num<=1000.\n          array[num]++;\n      }\n\n      int countMax = 0;\n      for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) { // note: the original Java loop started at 1? \n          // In the Java program: for (int i=1; i<array.length; i++)\n          // array.length is 1001, so i from 1 to 1000.\n          if (array[i] > countMax) {\n              countMax = array[i];\n          }\n      }\n\n      // But note: the Java program does not consider index0? \n      // The loop starts at i=1. So if there is a number 0, it would be in array[0] but not considered.\n      // However, the problem says the numbers are between 1 and 1000. So we are safe.\n\n      char s[4];\n      if (n % 2 == 0) {\n          if (countMax <= n/2) {\n              strcpy(s, \"YES\");\n          } else {\n              strcpy(s, \"NO\");\n          }\n      } else {\n          if (countMax <= n/2 + 1) {\n              strcpy(s, \"YES\");\n          } else {\n              strcpy(s, \"NO\");\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 3: replace commas in s -> store in s2 (same as s since no commas)\n      char s2[4];\n      strcpy(s2, s);\n      for (int i = 0; s2[i]; i++) {\n          if (s2[i] == ',') {\n              s2[i] = ' ';\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 4: run the third program on s2.\n      int len = strlen(s2);\n      // We'll create two copies: a and b.\n      char a[5], b[5];\n      strcpy(a, s2);\n      strcpy(b, s2);\n\n      int a1 = 0, a2 = 0;\n\n      // Forward pass: from i=1 to len-1\n      for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\n          if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n              // flip a[i]\n              if (a[i] == '1') {\n                  a[i] = '0';\n              } else {\n                  a[i] = '1';\n              }\n              a1++;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Backward pass: from i = len-1 down to 1\n      for (int i = len-1; i >= 1; i--) {\n          if (b[i] == b[i-1]) {\n              // flip b[i-1]\n              if (b[i-1] == '1') {\n                  b[i-1] = '0';\n              } else {\n                  b[i-1] = '1';\n              }\n              a2++;\n          }\n      }\n\n      int ans = (a1 < a2) ? a1 : a2;\n      printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the original Java program in the third step uses 0-indexed and the backward loop goes from len-1 down to 1 (inclusive). We do the same.\n\nThis program should be correct.\n\nHowever, we must test with a sample input.\n\nSample input for the first program (that outputs \"YES\"):\n\n  3\n  1 2 1\n\n  Then the frequency: \n      1:2, 2:1 -> max=2.\n      n=3 (odd): condition: max<= (3/2)+1 -> 2<= (1+1)=2 -> true -> \"YES\"\n\n  Then the chain: second program -> \"YES\", third program -> 0.\n\nSample input for \"NO\":\n\n  3\n  1 1 1\n\n  Then max=3, condition: 3<= 3/2+1 -> 3<= 1+1=2 -> false -> \"NO\"\n\n  Then output 0.\n\nSo the program outputs 0 in both cases.\n\nBut we can also test with a non-binary string that has adjacent duplicates? But our string is fixed. However, if we had a comma in the string? But we don't. \n\nTherefore, we output 0.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The entire chain on the same input as the original first program would output 0.\n\nWe are done.\n\nHowever, note: the original third program might have a bug? The backward pass flips the left character (at i-1) and then the next comparisons (for i-2 and i-1) use the flipped value? Yes, and that is intended. We do the same.\n\nBut we never get to that because we don't have adjacent duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the final C program is as above."
