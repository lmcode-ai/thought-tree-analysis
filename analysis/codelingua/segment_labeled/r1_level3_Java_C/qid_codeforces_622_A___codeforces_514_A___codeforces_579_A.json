Then while (getValueAtIndex(2) <= 1? 2<=1? false -> so nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n                startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1)=1. output: 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n            Second program: \n                x=1\n                temp=1: \n                    digit=1 -> candidate=8 -> 8<1? false -> chosen=1. then num = 0+1*1=1. output=1. Third program:\n                n=1: while (1>0): \n                        1 & 1 = 1 -> count=1\n                    then n>>=1 -> n=0 -> break.\n                output=1. So we output 1.

The output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third. The final output is the output of the third program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer `position` and computes a value `(position - startIndex) + 1` which is printed.\n 2. The second program (codeforces_514_A) reads a long integer (which is the output of the first) and transforms each digit: \n      if (9-digit) is less than the digit, then use (9-digit) unless it's the first digit and (9-digit) becomes 0 (then keep the digit).\n    Then it forms the new number and prints it.\n 3. The third program (codeforces_579_A) reads an integer (the output of the second) and counts the number of ones in its binary representation.\n\n However, note that the first program outputs a long integer, the second program expects a long integer and outputs a long integer, and the third program expects an integer (but we can read the long as an integer if it fits).\n\n Since we are chaining without I/O in between, we will:\n   - Read the initial input (a long) at the beginning (only the first block reads input).\n   - Process the first program's logic to get an output (a long) which becomes the input to the second program.\n   - Process the second program's logic on that long to get a new long (the transformed number) which becomes the input to the third program.\n   - The third program then converts that long into an integer? But note: the third program originally reads an integer. However, the output of the second program might be a long but we assume it's within integer range? The problem does not specify, but the original Java code for the third uses an int. We'll use long for the intermediate steps and then cast to int for the third if necessary, but note that the third program actually uses an int and the input is from a long. We have to be cautious.\n\n However, looking at the second program: the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number that is at most the same order as the original input (which is a long). But the transformation in the second program produces a number that is at most 9...9 (same number of digits). The third program counts the number of ones in the binary representation. The input to the third program must be nonnegative.\n\n But note: the third program originally uses `int n = str.nextInt();` and the input is from the second program's output. The second program outputs a long, but we have to consider if it can be larger than INT_MAX? The original problem chains the programs, so we assume the outputs are within the required ranges.\n\n Plan:\n\n We'll break down each program into a function that takes the input and returns the output.\n\n Function for the first program: \n    long program1(long position) {\n        // ... same logic as solve() in the first Java program, but returning the result instead of printing.\n    }\n\n Function for the second program:\n    long program2(long x) {\n        // ... same logic as the main of the second Java program, but without reading from stdin, and using the passed x.\n    }\n\n Function for the third program:\n    int program3(long n_long) {\n        // We note that the original third program reads an integer. So if the input to the third program is within int, we can cast.\n        // But the problem says: the entire chain on the same input. We assume the output of the second is within the range of int? \n        // However, the original third program uses an integer. So we cast to int? But what if the long is too big?\n        // Alternatively, we can change the third program to use long? But the original third program uses int.\n\n        // Let's check the original third program: it reads an int. So if the output of the second is within [0, Integer.MAX_VALUE], then we can cast.\n\n        // However, the problem says: behave identically. The original third program would have read an integer. If the output of the second is a long that is too big to be an int, then the original chain would have thrown an exception? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        // We must assume that the input to the third program is within the int range? Because the original chain uses an int in the third.\n\n        // So we cast: int n = (int) n_long;   But we must check if it fits? The problem says same behavior. If the original chain would have failed, we should fail? But the problem doesn't specify such edge.\n\n        // Alternatively, we can note that the output of the second program is a number that is at most 9...9 (with the same number of digits as the input). The input to the entire chain is a long (max ~1e18). The output of the first program is at most the input (so also a long). The second program transforms each digit, so the number of digits is at most 19. The maximum value is 10^19-1? But wait: we are forming the number from digits. Actually, the value of the second program's output is at most 999...9 (19 digits) which is about 1e19-1, which is beyond long (which is about 9e18). \n\n        // However, the second program uses long and the input to the second is a long. The output of the second is stored in a long. But 10^19 is beyond long (max ~9e18). So the second program would overflow? \n\n        // Let me check: the second program does:\n        //   newNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * (long) Math.pow(10, pow);\n        // Math.pow(10, pow) returns a double. Then cast to long? For 18 digits, 10^18 is within long, but 10^19 is beyond.\n\n        // Actually, the maximum number of digits is 19. The maximum value for a 19-digit number is 10^19-1, which is 10000000000000000000-1, which is 999...9 (19 times). But the maximum value of a long in Java is Long.MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807 (19 digits). So the second program might overflow for 19-digit numbers that are above 9223372036854775807.\n\n        // However, note that the input to the second program is the output of the first program. The first program's output is: (position - startIndex) + 1. The original input (position) is a long. The startIndex is at most the same as position? Actually, the first program finds an index such that the value at that index (which is a quadratic) is <= position. Then the output is (position - startIndex) + 1. Since startIndex is at least 1, the output is at most position. So the output of the first program is at most the input, which is a long. Therefore, the input to the second program is at most the original input (a long). The second program then transforms the digits. The transformed number might be as large as 9 times 10^(d-1) where d is the number of digits of the input. But the original input is a long (max ~9e18) so the transformed number is also at most 999...9 (19 nines) which is 10^19-1. However, note that 10^19-1 is 10000000000000000000-1 = 9999999999999999999, which is greater than Long.MAX_VALUE (9223372036854775807). Therefore, the second program might produce an overflow.\n\n        // But the original second program uses long. So when the number is beyond Long.MAX_VALUE, the result would be incorrect? However, the problem states that the entire chain is executed on the same input. We are to reproduce the same behavior. So we must do the same.\n\n        // However, note: the original second program uses Math.pow(10, pow) which returns a double. Then multiplies by a long? Then adds to a long. This might lose precision.\n\n        // We have two options:\n        //   a) Reimplement the second program with big integers? But the original didn't.\n        //   b) Use the same method and hope that for the given inputs (which are at most the original long) the transformed number fits in a long? But the transformed number can be up to 10^19-1, which is beyond long.\n\n        // However, note the original second program: \n        //   It breaks the number into digits (from least significant to most). Then it forms the new number by:\n        //        newNumber = newNumber + digit * (long) Math.pow(10, pow);\n        //   For pow=18, we have 10^18. The digit is at most 9. Then 9 * 10^18 is 9000000000000000000, which is less than Long.MAX_VALUE? \n        //        Long.MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807 ~ 9.2e18 -> 9.2 * 10^18.\n        //        9 * 10^18 = 9000000000000000000 < 9223372036854775807 -> so it fits.\n\n        //   But what about 19 digits? The original input (a long) has at most 19 digits? The maximum long is 19 digits. The first program outputs a number that is at most the input, so also at most 19 digits. The second program then forms a number that has the same number of digits? Actually, it doesn't add digits, it transforms each digit. So the number of digits remains the same. Therefore, the maximum value is 9 * 10^18 (for 19-digit number, the most significant digit is multiplied by 10^18, not 10^19). Because we break the number from least to most, and the most significant digit is at index 0 in the list? Actually, no: the list is built from least to most, and then we iterate from the first element (which is the least) to the last (which is the most). Then we do:\n        //        for i from 0 to len-1: \n        //            newNumber += list.get(i) * (10^i)\n        //        So the last element (which is the most significant) is multiplied by 10^(len-1). Since the number of digits is at most 19, the exponent goes from 0 to 18. The maximum term for the most significant digit is at most 9 * 10^18, which is 9000000000000000000 < Long.MAX_VALUE. Therefore, the entire number fits in a long.\n\n        // So we can safely use long for the second program.\n\n        // Now, the third program: the input is the output of the second program, which is a long. But the original third program uses an int. However, the output of the second program is at most 19 digits, which is at most 9e18 -> which is way beyond int (max ~2e9). \n\n        // This is a problem: the original third program uses an int. So if we run the original chain, the third program would read the long output of the second program with `sc.nextInt()`? That would fail if the number is beyond Integer.MAX_VALUE. But the problem states: \"behaves identically\". The original chain would throw an exception if the second program outputs a number that is too big for an int? \n\n        // However, looking at the original third program: it uses `int n = str.nextInt();` and the Scanner would try to parse an integer. If the token is out of the int range, it would throw an InputMismatchException.\n\n        // Therefore, our C program must also fail? Or the problem expects that the inputs are such that the entire chain works? The problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input is such that the second program's output is beyond int, then the original chain fails. Our C program must also fail.\n\n        // But we are to write a single C program. How do we handle this? We could read the input to the third program as a long and then check if it is within the int range. If not, we output an error? However, the problem says \"behave identically\". The original chain would throw an exception and crash. We can simulate by checking and exiting with an error message? But the problem does not specify the exact error behavior.\n\n        // Alternatively, note that the third program actually does:\n        //   while (n > 0) { ... }\n        //   and n is an int. If we pass a long that is too big for an int, then when we cast to int, we get an overflow (undefined behavior in C, but in Java it would be the lower 32 bits). But the original Java program would not even read it as an int: the Scanner.nextInt() would throw an exception.\n\n        // So we must simulate the exception? But the problem does not specify how to handle errors. We are to assume the input is valid? The problem says \"behaves identically\", meaning for the same input that the original chain works, we must produce the same output. For inputs that break the chain, we are free to do what? We are not told.\n\n        // Since the problem says \"the entire sequence\", we assume the input is such that the chain works? Or we must replicate the entire behavior including errors? The problem is ambiguous.\n\n        // Let's look at the original problem statements for the three programs:\n\n        // First: Codeforces 622A - Infinite Sequence\n        //   Input: a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^15)\n        //   Output: the number at the n-th position.\n\n        // Second: Codeforces 514A - Chewba\u0441ca and Number\n        //   Input: non-negative integer x (can have up to 19 digits, but note the constraints: x can be as large as 10^18, but the problem says x>=0 and at most 19 digits)\n        //   Output: the minimum number you can get.\n\n        // Third: Codeforces 579A - Raising Bacteria\n        //   Input: a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9)\n\n        // Therefore, the output of the first program is a number between 1 and 10^15? (since the input is between 1 and 10^15). Then the second program: the input is between 1 and 10^15 (so at most 16 digits). The second program transforms the digits: the transformed number is at most 999...9 (16 nines) which is 10^16-1, which is about 1e16 -> which is beyond int (max ~2e9) but within long. Then the third program: the input is the output of the second program, which is at most 1e16? But the third program expects an integer n (1<=n<=1e9). So if the output of the second program is greater than 1e9, then the third program would fail.\n\n        // This indicates that the chain is not intended for arbitrary inputs? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n        // However, note the specific inputs: the first program outputs a number that is the position in the sequence. The sequence is: [1, 2,2, 3,3,3, 4,4,4,4, ...]. The output of the first program is the actual number at that position? Actually, the first program outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1, which is the offset within the group. Since the group for the number k has k elements, the offset is between 1 and k. And k is the group index? Actually, the group index is the number that appears. The group for k starts at index: 1 + (k-1)*k/2. The output is the offset (which is between 1 and k). So the output of the first program is at most k, and k is the group index. The group index k for an input n (up to 10^15) is at most about sqrt(2*n) which is about sqrt(2e15) ~ 4.7e7. So the output of the first program is at most 4.7e7.\n\n        // Then the second program: input is at most 4.7e7 (which is 8 digits). The second program transforms each digit. The transformed number will also be at most 8 digits -> maximum value 99999999, which is about 1e8. Then the third program: input is at most 1e8, which is within the int range and also within [1, 1e9]. So the chain is safe.\n\n        // Therefore, we can safely cast the output of the second program to int for the third program? Because the maximum value is 99999999 (8 digits) which is within int.\n\n        // So we do: \n        //   int n = (int) n_long;   // because we know it's at most 8 digits (so <= 10^8) which is within int.\n\n        // Alternatively, we can change the third program to use long for n? But the original third program uses int. However, the counting of ones in the binary representation for a number that is at most 10^8 (which is 100000000) is safe with int.\n\n        // So we write the third program as:\n\n        //   int n = (int) n_long;\n        //   ... same as the original third program.\n\n        // But note: the original third program uses an int and the input is an int. So we are safe.\n\n        // Alternatively, we can note that the third program does not require the entire number to be stored as an int? Actually, it does: n is an int. But the input is at most 10^8, which is within int.\n\n        // Therefore, we proceed.\n\n        // Steps for the third program function:\n        //   Convert the input long to int (since we know it's safe) and then do the same logic.\n\n    }\n\n However, to be safe and generic, we should note that the third program's logic only uses nonnegative integers and the operations (mod 2, divide by 2) work the same for long as for int as long as the value is within the int range. But we are casting to int because the original third program uses int.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We'll write:\n\n   long input = ... (read from stdin)\n\n   long result1 = program1(input);\n   long result2 = program2(result1);\n   int n = (int) result2;   // because we know from the problem context it's safe? But what if the chain is used for other inputs? The problem says \"the entire sequence\" and the original chain was for specific inputs. We assume the input is in the range [1, 10^15] as per the first program's constraints.\n\n   Then run the third program on n.\n\n But note: the second program might output a negative number? The second program: the input is positive. It transforms each digit: if 9-digit is less than the digit then use 9-digit (unless it's the first digit and 9-digit becomes 0 -> then keep the digit). So the output is nonnegative. Also, the input is positive so we are safe.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the initial long from stdin.\n\n   Then:\n        long r1 = program1(initial_input);\n        long r2 = program2(r1);\n        int r3 = program3((int)r2);   // we cast to int\n\n   Then output r3.\n\n However, note: the third program originally outputs an integer (the count of ones). So we output that integer.\n\n But wait: the third program in Java does:\n        System.out.println(ans);\n\n So we output the integer.\n\n Now, let's code each function.\n\n Important: the first program uses a helper function `getValueAtIndex`. We'll keep that.\n\n Function program1:\n\n   long program1(long position) {\n        long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n        // while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n        //   nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        // }\n        // Then while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n        // Then: long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n        // Then return (position - startIndex) + 1;\n\n        // However, note: the original program prints that value. We return it.\n\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        }\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n        }\n        long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n        return position - startIndex + 1;\n   }\n\n   long getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n        return 1 + ( (index - 1) * index ) / 2;\n   }\n\n Function program2:\n\n   long program2(long x) {\n        // We are going to break x into digits. Note: x is positive (since the output of program1 is at least 1 and at most about 4.7e7).\n\n        // If x is 0? The original program: while (x>0) ... so if x==0, we skip and then form newNumber=0. But note: the output of program1 is at least 1, so x>=1.\n\n        // Steps:\n        //   Create an array (or list) of digits (in reverse order: least significant first).\n        //   Then process each digit: for each digit d (from least to most, but note: the original program processes the least significant first and stores in a list, then when forming the new number, the first element in the list becomes the least significant? Actually, no: the list is built by:\n        //        list.add(x % 10);   // so the first element in the list is the least significant.\n        //   Then, when forming the new number: we iterate from the first element (index0) to the last, and we do:\n        //        newNumber += digit * (10^pow)   with pow starting at 0 and increasing.\n        //   So the first element (least significant) is at pow=0, then next at pow=1, etc.\n\n        //   But note: the transformation: \n        //        if (9 - d < d) then we use 9-d unless it's the first digit (meaning the most significant in the original number) and 9-d==0? Actually, the original program says \"if (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0)\" meaning: if this is the last digit (the most significant) and 9-d becomes 0, then we don't use 0. But note: in the list, the last element we add is the most significant? Actually, the list is built from least to most? Then when we form the number, the last element in the list is multiplied by the highest power (so it becomes the most significant in the new number). Therefore, in the list, the last element is the most significant.\n\n        //   How do we know which digit is the most significant? The original program does not store the position in the original number. It uses: \n        //        long r = x % 10;\n        //        x = x / 10;\n        //        then, when x becomes 0, we break.\n        //   Then, the last digit we process is the most significant.\n\n        //   In the list, the last element is the most significant.\n\n        //   Therefore, when we process the digits, we don't know during the modulo step which one is the most significant. The original program uses: \n        //        if (x / 10 == 0)  -> meaning after we take this digit, the remaining x is 0, so this is the last digit (the most significant).\n\n        //   However, note: the condition \"if (9 - r < r)\" is applied to every digit. Then there is an extra condition: if (x/10 == 0 && 9-r==0) then we use r. Otherwise, we use 9-r.\n\n        //   We can simulate:\n\n        //        We break the number into a list of digits (from least to most). Then we traverse the list in reverse order (to know the most significant) is not done. Instead, during the breakdown we know the last digit we process is the most significant? Actually, we don't store that information. The original condition uses the current value of x: when we are at the last digit (the most significant) we have x/10==0.\n\n        //   How to do without knowing the entire list? We can store the digits and also store the index of the most significant? Alternatively, we can store the digits and then process the list backwards? But the original program does not do that.\n\n        //   Actually, the original program does:\n\n        //        List<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();\n        //        while (x > 0) {\n        //            long r = x % 10;\n        //            if (9 - r < r) {\n        //                if (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) \n        //                    list.add(r);\n        //                else \n        //                    list.add(9 - r);\n        //            } else {\n        //                list.add(r);\n        //            }\n        //            x = x / 10;\n        //        }\n\n        //   The condition \"x / 10 == 0\" is checked at the time we process the digit. The next digit (if any) would be the next more significant? Actually, the current digit is the last digit of the current x. And when we do x/10, if the result is 0, then the next iteration will break. So the condition \"x / 10 == 0\" at the time of processing a digit means that after we remove this digit, the remaining part is 0 -> so this is the most significant digit.\n\n        //   Therefore, we can do the same: as we break down the number, we know the current state of x (the remaining part). We'll simulate:\n\n        //        long newX = x;   // we don't want to modify the original x? We are going to modify it.\n        //        We'll create an array to store the transformed digits (in the order of least significant first).\n\n        //        But note: the original program stores the transformed digits in the list in the order: first the least significant, then the next, ... and the most significant last.\n\n        //        Then when forming the number: \n        //            for (int i=0; i<list.size(); i++) {\n        //                newNumber += list.get(i) * (long)Math.pow(10, i);\n        //            }\n\n        //        This is: the element at index0 (the first added) is multiplied by 10^0 -> least significant, and the last added (the most significant) is multiplied by 10^(list.size()-1) -> which is the most significant.\n\n        //   How to do without Math.pow? We can use a power variable and multiply by 10 each time? Or we can build the number by:\n\n        //        long newNumber = 0;\n        //        long base = 1;\n        //        for (int i=0; i<list.size(); i++) {\n        //            newNumber += list.get(i) * base;\n        //            base *= 10;\n        //        }\n\n        //   But note: the list is in the order: [d0, d1, d2, ...] where d0 is the least significant and d_{k-1} is the most significant.\n\n        //   Alternatively, we can avoid storing the list and build the number on the fly? But the transformation condition requires knowing if we are at the most significant digit.\n\n        //   We'll do:\n\n        //        long num = 0;\n        //        long factor = 1;\n        //        while (x > 0) {\n        //            long r = x % 10;\n        //            long transformed;\n        //            if (9 - r < r) {\n        //                if (x / 10 == 0 && (9 - r) == 0) {\n        //                    transformed = r;\n        //                } else {\n        //                    transformed = 9 - r;\n        //                }\n        //            } else {\n        //                transformed = r;\n        //            }\n        //            num = num + transformed * factor;\n        //            factor *= 10;\n        //            x /= 10;\n        //        }\n\n        //   But note: the condition \"x / 10 == 0\" is checked at the current x (which is the remaining part). However, when we do x/=10, we are modifying x. And the condition for the next digit will be different.\n\n        //   However, the condition for the current digit uses the current x (which is the entire number without the digits we've taken). So it's correct.\n\n        //   But note: the condition for the most significant digit: at the start, if the number has d digits, then the first digit we take (the least significant) is not the most significant. The last digit we take (when x becomes 0 after division) is the most significant. And at that iteration, we have: \n        //        x0 = original number -> then we take the least significant, then x1 = x0/10.\n        //        ... until the last digit: we take the digit and then x_last = 0 -> so the condition for the last digit we process (which is the most significant) is: at the start of the iteration, x is the original number without the digits we've taken? Actually, at the start of the iteration for the most significant digit, x is a single digit (so x/10==0). \n\n        //   So we can do:\n\n        //        long result = 0;\n        //        long base = 1;\n        //        while (x) {\n        //            long digit = x % 10;\n        //            long candidate = 9 - digit;\n        //            if (candidate < digit) {\n        //                // candidate is better, but if this is the last digit (x/10==0) and candidate==0, then we skip?\n        //                if (x < 10 && candidate == 0) {\n        //                    // then we use the original digit\n        //                } else {\n        //                    digit = candidate;\n        //                }\n        //            }\n        //            result += digit * base;\n        //            base *= 10;\n        //            x /= 10;\n        //        }\n\n        //   However, note: the condition in the original is: if (9 - r < r) -> then consider replacing. We do the same.\n\n        //   But note: if digit is 9, then 9-9=0, and 0<9 -> true. Then we check: if this is the last digit and 0==0 -> true, so we use the original digit (9). Otherwise, we use 0? But for a non-last digit, we use 0. That's acceptable.\n\n        //   So we write:\n\n        //        long num = 0;\n        //        long mult = 1;\n        //        long temp = x;   // we work on a temporary variable\n        //        while (temp > 0) {\n        //            long rem = temp % 10;\n        //            long candidate = 9 - rem;\n        //            long digit = rem;\n        //            if (candidate < rem) {\n        //                // But if this is the last digit (temp/10==0) and candidate==0, then we leave it as rem?\n        //                if (temp == rem) { // because temp/10==0 means temp is a single digit?

But we haven't divided yet.\n\n        //            // Instead, we can check: if (temp < 10) then we are at the last digit.\n\n        //            if (candidate < rem) {\n        //                if (temp < 10 && candidate == 0) {\n        //                    // leave as rem\n        //                } else {\n        //                    digit = candidate;\n        //                }\n        //            }\n\n        //            num += digit * mult;\n        //            mult *= 10;\n        //            temp /= 10;\n        //        }\n\n        //   But note: the condition `if (temp < 10)` is equivalent to `temp/10==0`? Yes.\n\n        //   However, what if the number has a 0 in the middle? The condition candidate<rem: for 0, candidate=9, which is not <0 -> so we leave as 0. That's correct.\n\n        //   Let's test with a small number: 10 -> \n        //        temp=10: \n        //            rem = 0 -> candidate=9 -> 9<0? false -> digit=0.\n        //            then temp becomes 1.\n        //            then rem=1, candidate=8 -> 8<1? false -> digit=1.\n        //        So we get 10 -> becomes 01? but we are building: \n        //            first digit (0) is multiplied by 1 -> 0\n        //            then next: 1 * 10 = 10 -> total 10.\n        //        But the original program would do:\n        //            x=10: \n        //                r = 0 -> 9-0=9>0 -> so list.add(0)\n        //                x = 10/10 = 1\n        //                then r=1 -> 9-1=8<1? -> 8<1 -> false? Actually, 8<1 is false -> so list.add(1)\n        //            then the list: [0,1] -> then newNumber = 0*10^0 + 1*10^1 = 10.\n        //        So we are correct.\n\n        //   But the original program's condition for 1: 9-1=8, which is not < 1 -> so false. So we leave as 1.\n\n        //   However, the condition in the original is: if (9-rem < rem) -> 8<1? false -> so we leave as 1.\n\n        //   Therefore, we are good.\n\n        //   However, note: the condition for candidate<rem is: if (candidate < rem) then ... but if candidate==rem, we don't enter? The original condition: if (9-rem < rem) -> so if 9-rem < rem, then we consider. If equal, we leave.\n\n        //   So we do the same.\n\n        //   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   }\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the temporary list and build the number directly.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        long result2 = 0;\n        long multiplier = 1;\n        long remaining = x;\n        while (remaining > 0) {\n            long digit = remaining % 10;\n            long candidate = 9 - digit;\n            long chosen = digit;\n\n            if (candidate < digit) {\n                // Check if this is the most significant digit (the last one we are processing) and candidate is zero?\n                if (remaining < 10) { // meaning after this digit, we break\n                    if (candidate != 0) {\n                        chosen = candidate;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    chosen = candidate;\n                }\n            }\n\n            result2 += chosen * multiplier;\n            multiplier *= 10;\n            remaining /= 10;\n        }\n\n        return result2;\n\n Function program3:\n\n   int program3(long n_long) {\n        int n = (int) n_long;   // safe because n_long <= 10^8 (from the chain context) -> but we check? Actually, we know from the chain context it's safe, but to be generic we can use long for n? However, the original program uses int.\n\n        // But note: the original program uses int and the input is an int. So we use int.\n\n        // We'll do:\n\n        //   String s = \"\";   // we don't need to build a string. We can count the ones directly?\n        //   The original program: \n        //        while (n>0) {\n        //            int x = n%2;\n        //            n /= 2;\n        //            s += x;\n        //        }\n        //        then count the ones in the string.\n\n        //   But we can do:\n\n        //        int count = 0;\n        //        while (n) {\n        //            count += (n & 1);\n        //            n /= 2;\n        //        }\n\n        //   However, the original program builds the string and then counts the ones. But the result is the same.\n\n        //   We can do:\n\n        //        int count = 0;\n        //        int temp = n;\n        //        while (temp > 0) {\n        //            if (temp % 2 == 1) {\n        //                count++;\n        //            }\n        //            temp /= 2;\n        //        }\n\n        //   But note: the original program builds the string in reverse order? Actually, the order doesn't matter for counting.\n\n        //   We'll do:\n\n        //        int count = 0;\n        //        int num = n;\n        //        while (num > 0) {\n        //            if (num % 2 == 1) {\n        //                count++;\n        //            }\n        //            num /= 2;\n        //        }\n\n        //   Then return count.\n\n        //   Alternatively, we can use bit operations: \n        //        while (num) {\n        //            count += num & 1;\n        //            num >>= 1;\n        //        }\n\n        //   But note: for negative? We don't have negative.\n\n        //   We'll do:\n\n        int count = 0;\n        int num = (int) n_long;   // we cast to int\n        while (num > 0) {\n            count += num & 1;\n            num >>= 1;\n        }\n        return count;\n\n        // However, note: shifting right is equivalent to division by 2 for nonnegative? Yes.\n\n   }\n\n But wait: the original program builds the string from the least significant bit to the most, but then it traverses the string from index0 to the end. The string is the binary representation in reverse? Then it counts the ones. The count is the same.\n\n However, there is a difference: the original program does not reset the count? It counts the ones in the entire representation. Our method does the same.\n\n But note: the original program does:\n\n        String s = \"\";\n        while (n>0) {\n            int x = n%2;\n            n /= 2;\n            s += x + \"\";\n        }\n        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {\n            if (s.charAt(i)=='1') ans++;\n        }\n\n        This counts the ones in the reverse binary representation? Actually, the string s is the reverse of the usual binary representation. But the count of ones is the same.\n\n        For example: 5 -> in the loop: \n            n=5: x=1, then n=2 -> s=\"1\"\n            n=2: x=0, then n=1 -> s=\"10\"\n            n=1: x=1, then n=0 -> s=\"101\"\n        Then the string is \"101\", and it has two ones. But the binary representation of 5 is \"101\" (forward) and we have two ones? Actually, no: the binary representation is 101 (which has two ones). The string we built is the reverse: we built the least significant first? Then the string is \"101\" which is the reverse of the usual representation? Actually, the usual representation is from most to least. \n\n        But the count of ones is the same regardless of order.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n We'll write the optimized version.\n\n Now, the main function:\n\n        long input;\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &input);\n\n        long r1 = program1(input);\n        long r2 = program2(r1);\n        int r3 = program3(r2);\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", r3);\n\n But note: the first program in Java uses a while loop that doubles the index until it overshoots. We have to be cautious of integer overflow? The index is a long, and the value at index is quadratic: (index*(index-1))/2 + 1. The index might become large? The input is up to 10^15. The maximum index we need: the quadratic equation: index*(index+1)/2 ~ n => index ~ sqrt(2*n). For n=10^15, sqrt(2e15) is about 1.4e7, which is within long.\n\n        However, the first while loop: we double the index until the value at index*2 is less than the position. Then we do a linear scan? The linear scan might be long? The gap between the last doubling and the target index is about the same as the last doubling? So we do at most O(sqrt(n)) steps? Actually, the doubling part is O(log(sqrt(n))) = O(log(n)) and then the linear scan is O(sqrt(n)) which is 1.4e7 steps? That might be too slow.\n\n        But the original program does that. We have to replicate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use binary search? But the problem says: translate the entire sequence. We must replicate the exact logic.\n\n        We'll do the same.\n\n        However, note: the first while loop doubles the index until the value at index*2 is at least the position. Then the linear scan: we do at most the step size? The step size is the last doubling step? The last doubling step: we have an index k such that the value at k is < position and at 2k is >= position? Then we do a linear scan from k to 2k? The gap between k and 2k is k. And k is about the index we are looking for (which is ~sqrt(2*position)). So the linear scan is O(sqrt(n)), which is 1.4e7 steps. In C, that is acceptable? In a tight loop, 1.4e7 iterations might take about 0.1 seconds? So it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: the input can be up to 10^15 -> sqrt(10^15) is 10^7.5 -> about 31.6 million? Actually: sqrt(2e15) is about sqrt(2)*10^7.5 ~ 1.414 * 31622776.6 ~ 44 million? That might be borderline in C.\n\n        We must optimize the linear scan? But the original Java program does the same. We have to replicate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the index we are looking for is the maximum index such that value <= position. The value function is increasing. We can do a binary search? But the original program does not. We must replicate the doubling then linear.\n\n        However, the problem says: translate the entire sequence. So we do the same.\n\n        But note: the original program does:\n\n            long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n            }\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n            }\n\n        The first loop: we double until we overshoot. The second loop: we then do a linear scan until the next index overshoots.\n\n        How many iterations in the second loop? At most the gap between the last doubled index and the target? The target index is about the solution to: 1 + (index*(index-1))/2 <= position < 1 + (index*(index+1))/2? Actually, the group index. The gap is the doubling step: we started at k and then doubled until 2k, then we do at most k steps? The last k is about the solution? So the solution is about sqrt(2*position). The doubling step: we start at 1, then 2, 4, 8, ... until we hit about sqrt(2*position). The number of doubling steps is O(log(sqrt(2*position))) = O(log(n)). Then the linear scan is O(sqrt(2*position)) which is O(sqrt(n)) ~ 44e6 for n=1e15. That is acceptable in C? We hope so.\n\n        But 44e6 iterations in a tight loop in C might be about 0.1 seconds? We'll assume it's acceptable.\n\n        If we want to be faster, we could do a binary search in the second step? But the problem says: translate.\n\n        We'll do the same as the original.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We'll write the helper function getValueAtIndex as a function that takes a long and returns a long.\n\n   Note: the formula: 1 + ( (index-1) * index ) / 2.\n\n   But: (index-1)*index might be huge? But index is at most about 4.4e7, so (index-1)*index is about 2e15, which is within long (in C, long is typically 64 bits on modern systems, same as Java). But we are compiling for 64-bit.\n\n   We assume long is 64 bits.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        long getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n            // Compute: 1 + (index-1)*index/2\n            // Note: we do multiplication first: (index-1)*index might be even? We can do: \n            //   return 1 + (index * (index-1)) / 2;\n            // But integer division is truncation? The product is even? Because either index or index-1 is even.\n\n            return 1 + (index * (index-1)) / 2;\n        }\n\n   But note: the multiplication might overflow for index near the limit of long? The maximum index we use is about 4.4e7 -> 44000000 -> 44000000 * 43999999 = about 1.936e15, which is within long (max ~9e18). So safe.\n\n   Then program1 as described.\n\n   Now, the entire C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        // Function declarations\n        long getValueAtIndex(long index);\n        long program1(long position);\n        long program2(long x);\n        int program3(long n_long);\n\n        int main() {\n            long input;\n            scanf(\"%ld\", &input);   // %ld for long? But the input is a long integer (up to 10^15). We use %lld for long long? But the problem says long in Java is 64 bits. In C, we might use long long to ensure 64 bits.\n\n            // However, the problem does not specify the C data types. We assume the system has 64-bit long? But in Windows, long is 32 bits? So we use long long.\n\n            // Let me change: we use long long for all integers to be safe.\n\n            // But the problem says \"long\" in Java. We'll use long long in C.\n\n            // We'll change all longs to long long.\n\n            // However, the problem says: \"long position\" in the first program. We'll use long long.\n\n            // Revised:\n\n            //   Replace every `long` with `long long`\n\n            // But the third program uses int for the count? That's fine.\n\n            // Let me rewrite with long long.\n\n        }\n\n        Actually, to be safe for 64-bit, we'll use:\n\n            long long input;\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &input);\n\n            long long r1 = program1(input);\n            long long r2 = program2(r1);\n            int r3 = program3(r2);\n\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", r3);\n\n        And change the function signatures:\n\n            long long getValueAtIndex(long long index);\n            long long program1(long long position);\n            long long program2(long long x);\n\n        And in program3, we take a long long and cast to int.\n\n        Now, the functions:\n\n        long long getValueAtIndex(long long index) {\n            // Check for index==0? The formula: 1 + (index-1)*index/2. For index=0: undefined? But the program starts at index=1.\n            return 1 + (index * (index-1)) / 2;\n        }\n\n        long long program1(long long position) {\n            long long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n            }\n            while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) {\n                nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n            }\n            long long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n            return position - startIndex + 1;\n        }\n\n        long long program2(long long x) {\n            if (x == 0) {\n                return 0;   // but the input x>=1, so this is not necessary?

But n is nonnegative.\n\n        However, what if n is 0? The original program: \n            while (n>0) ... so we skip -> count=0.\n        But the problem: the input to the third program is the output of the second program, which is at least 1? Actually, the first program outputs at least 1. The second program: it transforms the digits. The smallest digit we can get is 0, but the entire number? The first digit (most significant) cannot be zero. So the number is at least 1? Actually, if the input to the second program is 1, then:\n            temp=1: \n                digit=1 -> candidate=8 -> 8<1? false -> so we leave as 1.\n            then the number is 1.\n        Then the third program: input=1 -> count=1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if the second program outputs 0? Then the third program would get 0. But the chain context: the first program outputs at least 1. And the second program: it transforms the digits. The most significant digit cannot become zero? Actually, the condition: if the most significant digit becomes 0 we avoid. So the output of the second program is at least 1? Actually, the condition for the most significant digit: if candidate==0 we leave it as the original. So if the original digit is 9, we leave it as 9. Therefore, the most significant digit is at least 1. So the number is at least 1.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to handle 0 in the third program.\n\n        Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n        Note: the original first program uses a buffer size. We don't need to set buffer size in C? We'll let the system handle it.\n\n        Let me test with a small input:\n\n            Input to the entire chain: 1\n\n            First program: \n                position=1\n                nrstSeqStartIndx=1: \n                    getValueAtIndex(1) = 1 + (1*0)/2 = 1 -> so the first while: getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2*1)/2 = 1+1=2 -> 2<1? false -> so skip doubling.\n                Then while (getValueAtIndex(2) <= 1? 2<=1? false -> so nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n                startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n                output: 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n            Second program: \n                x=1\n                temp=1: \n                    digit=1 -> candidate=8 -> 8<1? false -> chosen=1.\n                    then num = 0+1*1=1.\n                output=1.\n\n            Third program:\n                n=1: \n                    while (1>0): \n                        1 & 1 = 1 -> count=1\n                    then n>>=1 -> n=0 -> break.\n                output=1.\n\n            So we output 1.\n\n        Another test: input=2\n\n            First program:\n                position=2\n                getValueAtIndex(2)= 1 + (2*1)/2 = 1+1=2 -> so the doubling loop: \n                    getValueAtIndex(1*2)=2 -> 2<2? false -> skip doubling.\n                Then while (getValueAtIndex(2)<=2 -> true -> nrstSeqStartIndx becomes 2.\n                    then getValueAtIndex(3)= 1 + (3*2)/2 = 1+3=4 -> 4<=2? false -> break.\n                So nrstSeqStartIndx=2.\n                startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n                output: 2-2+1=1.\n\n            Then the chain: 1 -> same as above -> output 1.\n\n            But the expected? The sequence: \n                index1:1, index2:2, index3:2, index4:3, ...\n                The 2nd element is 2, so the output of the first program should be 2? \n\n            Let me reexamine the first program:\n\n                The program is trying to find the largest index such that the value at that index (the starting index of the group) is <= position.\n\n                The groups:\n                    group1: [1] -> starts at index1=1, value=1.\n                    group2: [2,2] -> starts at index2=2, value=2.\n                    group3: [3,3,3] -> starts at index3=4, value=4.\n                    ...\n\n                For position=2: \n                    The group2 starts at index2=2, and the value at index2 is 2 (which is <=2). The next group starts at index3=4, which is >2. So the group index is 2.\n\n                Then the output is: (position - startIndex) + 1 = (2-2)+1 = 1.\n\n                The 2nd element in the sequence is 2, but the program outputs 1? \n\n            Actually, the program outputs the offset within the group? And the offset is the number that appears. The offset for the 2nd element is 1 (meaning the first element in group2)? Then the number is 2? But the program outputs 1? \n\n            That does not match the problem? \n\n            The problem: \"the number at the n-th position\". The 1st position:1, 2nd:2, 3rd:2, 4th:3, etc.\n\n            The program outputs: for position=2, it outputs 1? That is not 2.\n\n            I see: the problem says: the sequence is: 1, 2,2, 3,3,3, 4,4,4,4, ... \n            The 1st:1 -> group1, offset1:1 -> outputs 1 -> correct.\n            The 2nd: the first element of group2 -> which is 2 -> but the program outputs the offset? And the offset is 1? and then the number that appears is the group index? The group index is 2. So the number is 2? But the program outputs the offset? That doesn't make sense.\n\n            Actually, the program outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1 -> which is the offset. Then the problem says the number at that position is the group index? So we don't output the offset? We output the group index? \n\n            But the program does: \n                out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n\n            And for position=2: (2-2)+1=1 -> which is not the group index.\n\n            What is the group index? It is nrstSeqStartIndx. And the group index is the number that appears. So the number at position=2 should be 2.\n\n            The problem says: the sequence is defined by: the number k appears k times consecutively.\n\n            The group index is k. The offset within the group is (position - startIndex) + 1. But the value at that position is k, not the offset.\n\n            But the program outputs the offset? That is a bug.\n\n            Looking at the original Java program for codeforces_622_A:\n\n                The problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/622/A\n\n                The sample: \n                    Input: 1 -> Output: 1\n                    Input: 2 -> Output: 1   -> but expected 2?\n\n                Actually, the sample: \n                    Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n\n                The problem says: \n                    The first group is [1] -> so the first element is 1 -> output1 for input1.\n                    The second group is [2,2] -> so the second element is 2 -> output2 for input2? \n                    But the program for input2 outputs 1.\n\n            I see: the program finds the starting index of the group (which is the value of the first element of the group) and then outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1 -> which is the offset. But the problem asks for the value at the position, which is the group index (k). \n\n            But wait: the group index is the value? And the group index is the variable nrstSeqStartIndx? \n\n            The program does not output nrstSeqStartIndx. It outputs the offset.\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"Your task is to find the digit on the n-th position.\"\n\n            And the example: \n                n=1 -> 1\n                n=2 -> 2\n                n=3 -> 2\n\n            So the program is not doing that.\n\n            Actually, the program says: \n                \"The sequence is: 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5, ...\"\n\n            And the value at position n is the group index? \n\n            But the program outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1 -> which is the offset. That is not the group index.\n\n            I see: the group index is nrstSeqStartIndx. And the value at any position in the group is the group index? So we should output nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\n            But the program outputs (position - startIndex) + 1.\n\n            That is a mistake.\n\n            Let me check the original codeforces_622_A on codeforces: \n                The solution: \n                    long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n                    out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n\n            But the sample input 2 outputs 1, which is wrong.\n\n            I see: the problem says: \n                \"The first line contains an integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910^15) \u2014 the position of the digit you need to find.\"\n\n                And the output: \n                    the digit at the n-th position.\n\n            And the sample: \n                Input: 3 -> Output: 2.\n\n            How do we get 2 for input=3?\n                The group2 starts at index2=2 (so the group2 has two elements: at positions 2 and 3).\n                The value at position3: it is the second element of group2? -> so the offset is 2? But the program: \n                    For n=3:\n                        find the group index: \n                            doubling: \n                                index=1: value=1 -> then index=2: value=2 -> then index=4: value=4 -> 4<3? false -> so we stop doubling at index=2.\n                            then we check: getValueAtIndex(2+1)=getValueAtIndex(3)=4 -> 4<=3? false -> so group index=2.\n                        startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n                        output: (3-2)+1 = 2. -> which is correct.\n\n            And for n=2: \n                group index=2 (as above) -> output: (2-2)+1=1. -> which is not 2.\n\n            But the problem says the 2nd element is 2.\n\n            What is the group index for n=2? It is group2. And the value for group2 is 2. But the program outputs the offset (which is 1), not the group index.\n\n            I see the confusion: the problem asks for the digit at the n-th position, which is the group index, not the offset within the group.\n\n            But the program outputs the offset? \n\n            And the offset for group2 at position2 is 1? that would imply that the digit is 1? \n\n            But the group2 is the group for the digit 2.\n\n            So the program is not outputting the digit? \n\n            Let me read the codeforces_622_A code: \n                The function getValueAtIndex returns the starting index of the group for the digit 'index'. \n                For group2: getValueAtIndex(2) = 2 -> the group2 starts at position2.\n\n                Then the program outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1 -> which is the offset within the group.\n\n                But the problem asks for the digit, which is 2.\n\n            The program is not outputting the digit.\n\n            I see: the program is not outputting the group index (which is the digit) but the offset? \n\n            This is a known solution? Let me check the sample on the problem page.\n\n            The sample: \n                Input: 55 -> Output: 10.\n\n            How does that work?\n                The group index for 55: \n                    The group index k satisfies: k(k+1)/2 >= 55.\n                    Solve: k(k+1) >= 110 -> k=10: 10*11/2=55 -> so the group10 starts at 55? \n                    Then the offset: (55-55)+1=1? \n                    But the output is 10.\n\n            So the group index is 10, and the digit is 10.\n\n            Therefore, the program should output the group index, not the offset.\n\n            But the program outputs the offset? \n\n            The sample output for 55 is 10, but the program outputs 1.\n\n            This indicates the program is wrong.\n\n            However, the solution is: \n                long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n                out.println(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n\n            But the program currently outputs: (position - startIndex) + 1.\n\n            Let me try with n=55: \n                We find the group index: \n                    doubling: \n                        1: value=1\n                        2: value=2\n                        4: value= (4*3/2)+1 = 6+1=7\n                        8: value= (8*7/2)+1 = 28+1=29\n                        16: value= (16*15/2)+1=120+1=121 -> 121>55 -> so we stop at 8.\n                    then linear: \n                        8: value=29 <=55 -> next\n                        9: value= (9*8/2)+1=36+1=37 <=55 -> next\n                        10: value= (10*9/2)+1=45+1=46 <=55 -> next\n                        11: value= (11*10/2)+1=55+1=56 >55 -> so group index=10.\n                then output: 10.\n\n            So the program should output the group index (nrstSeqStartIndx), not the offset.\n\n            The original Java program is in the problem and it is accepted? Then why does it output the offset?\n\n            I check the problem again: \n                The example: \n                    Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n\n            And the program outputs the offset for group2: (3-2)+1=2 -> which is the offset, and then they say the digit is the group index? But the problem says the digit at position3 is 2.\n\n            How is the offset related to the digit? \n\n            The digit is the group index. The offset is the position within the group. But the problem does not ask for the offset.\n\n            But wait: the program outputs the offset? and the offset is 2 for n=3? and the example output is 2. So they are the same in this case?\n\n            For n=1: offset=1 -> output1 -> matches.\n            For n=2: offset=1 -> should be 2? doesn't match.\n\n            What is the group for n=2? group2. And the offset in group2 is 1 (the first element). The digit is 2. But the program outputs the offset, which is 1. That is not 2.\n\n            This indicates the program is wrong for n=2.\n\n            But the problem sample: \n                Input: 1 -> 1\n                Input: 2 -> 2\n                Input: 3 -> 2\n\n            So the program should output for n=2: 2.\n\n            Therefore, the program should output the group index, not the offset.\n\n            Let me check the first group: \n                group1: digit=1, and it has one element: at position1.\n                For n=1: group index=1.\n            group2: digit=2, and it has two elements: at positions2 and 3.\n                For n=2: group index=2.\n                For n=3: group index=2.\n\n            So the program should output the group index.\n\n            But the program outputs the offset. And the offset for n=2 is 1, for n=3 is 2.\n\n            This means the program is not doing what the problem asks.\n\n            However, the program is from a known contest and it is accepted. So it must be correct.\n\n            I see the mistake: the problem says the sequence is: \n                1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...\n            and the sample: \n                n=1 -> 1\n                n=2 -> 2\n                n=3 -> 2\n                n=4 -> 3\n                ...\n\n            In the program, the group index is the digit. The group1 starts at index1? and has one element -> position1: digit=1.\n            group2 starts at index2? and has two elements -> positions2 and 3: digit=2.\n            group3 starts at index4? and has three elements -> positions4,5,6: digit=3.\n\n            The value at a position is the group index.\n\n            Therefore, the program should output the group index.\n\n            But the program outputs: \n                (position - startIndex) + 1 \n\n            which is the position within the group. That is not the group index.\n\n            Unless the group index is (nrstSeqStartIndx) and the output is not the offset but the group index.\n\n            But the program currently does: out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n\n            For n=2: \n                group index = 2, and the output is 1.\n\n            For n=3: \n                group index = 2, and the output is 2.\n\n            For n=4: \n                group index = 3, and the output = (4 - 4) + 1 = 1.\n\n            So the output for n=4 is 1, but expected 3.\n\n            This is not matching.\n\n            Therefore, the program is not accepted for the sample.\n\n            I found an AC solution for this problem in Java: \n\n                public class Solution {\n                    public static void main(String[] args) {\n                        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n                        long n = in.nextLong();\n                        long l = 1, r = (long)2e9, ans = 0;\n                        while (l <= r) {\n                            long mid = (l + r) >> 1;\n                            long sum = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;\n                            if (sum <= n) {\n                                ans = mid;\n                                l = mid + 1;\n                            } else {\n                                r = mid - 1;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        n -= ans * (ans + 1) / 2;\n                        if (n == 0) {\n                            System.out.println(ans);\n                        } else {\n                            System.out.println(n);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            This solution: \n                It finds the largest ans such that ans*(ans+1)/2 <= n.\n                Then it subtracts: n - ans*(ans+1)/2. If the result is 0, it outputs ans, else outputs n (the remainder).\n\n            But for n=2: \n                ans=1 because 1*2/2=1<=2, then 2-1=1, so output 1. -> which is not 2.\n\n            This is not matching either.\n\n            Another solution:\n\n                long n = in.nextLong();\n                long low = 0, high = (long)1e8;\n                while(high - low > 1) {\n                    long mid = (low + high) / 2;\n                    if(mid * (mid+1) / 2 < n) {\n                        low = mid;\n                    } else {\n                        high = mid;\n                    }\n                }\n                // low is the group index such that its start is the largest that is < n.\n                // then the remainder = n - low*(low+1)/2;\n                out.println(n - low*(low+1)/2);\n\n            For n=2: \n                low = 1 because 1*2/2=1<2 -> then high=2, then we break. \n                Then output: 2 - 1=1.\n\n            This also outputs 1.\n\n            I see: the problem asks for the digit at the n-th position, but the these solutions output the position within the group.\n\n            The sample: \n                n=1 -> output: 1 (within group1: the first element of group1 is the only element, and the digit is 1, but the solution outputs 1) -> \n                but the digit should be 1, and the solution outputs 1.\n                n=2 -> output: 1 (within group2: the first element of group2) -> but the digit should be 2.\n\n            This is not the digit.\n\n            The problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/622/A\n\n            The sample output: \n                1\n                2\n                2\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            for n=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\n            The solution that outputs the offset within the group: \n                n=1:1\n                n=2:1\n                n=3:2\n                n=4:1\n                n=5:2\n                n=6:3\n\n            which is not the sample.\n\n            The only way to get the sample output is to output the group index.\n\n            Therefore, the intended solution is to output the group index.\n\n            But the program we have does not do that.\n\n            However, the program we are given is: \n\n                public static void solve() {\n                    long position = sc.nextLong();\n                    long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n                    while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n                        nrstSeqStartIndex *= 2;\n                    }\n                    while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n                    long startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n                    out.println((position - startIndex) + 1);\n                }\n\n            This outputs the offset within the group.\n\n            But the sample expected output for n=2 is 2, not 1.\n\n            This indicates the program is for a different problem? \n\n            Or the problem is: the digit at the n-th position is the group index, and the program is outputting the offset within the group, which is not the digit.\n\n            Therefore, the program is incorrect.\n\n            But the user provided this program and it is part of a chain. We must replicate it as given, even if it is for a different problem or has a bug.\n\n            So we output the offset within the group, as the first program does.\n\n            Then the chain continues: the offset is the input to the second program.\n\n            For the input 2, the first program outputs 1, then the second program outputs 1 (because 1 is not transformed) -> then the third program: \n                1 in binary has one '1' -> output 1.\n\n            The user's provided chain for input=2 outputs 1.\n\n            And for input=1, the chain outputs 1.\n\n            And for input=3: \n                first program: outputs 2 (offset within group2) \n                second program: 2 -> candidate=7 (9-2=7) -> 7<2? false -> leave as 2.\n                third program: 2 in binary is '10' -> one '1' -> output 1.\n\n            So input=3 -> output=1.\n\n            This is the behavior we replicate.\n\n            Therefore, we write the first program as given.\n\n        Final C code:"
