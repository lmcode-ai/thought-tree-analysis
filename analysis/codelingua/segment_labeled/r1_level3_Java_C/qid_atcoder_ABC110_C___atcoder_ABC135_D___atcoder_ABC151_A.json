Then it checks: at every occurrence of s in S, the corresponding character in T must be t. Also, every occurrence of t in T at the same positions as s in S must match. Actually, the code:\n\n        for (String s : A) {\n            int sIdx = S.indexOf(s);\n            if (sIdx < 0) continue;\n            String t = String.valueOf(T.charAt(sIdx));\n            int idx = 0;\n            while (idx < S.length()) {\n                if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >= 0) {\n                    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) ! = T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n                        res = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        idx = S.indexOf(s, idx) + 1;\n                    }\n                } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >= 0) {\n                    res = false;\n                    break;\n                } else break;\n            }\n            if (!res) break;\n        }\n\n    We can reimplement this in C.\n\n- Step 3: The second program:\n\n    We are given a string (str1) which is either \"No\" (2 characters) or \"Yes\" (3 characters). We need to simulate the DP:\n\n        long MOD = 1000000007;\n        int n = strlen(str1);\n        // We'll create a dp array: dp[i][j] for i in [0, n-1] and j in [0,12]\n        // But note: the original Java program processes the string from last character to first.\n\n        // We'll create an array for the current dp state? Actually, the original uses a 2D array for the entire dp. Steps in the second program:\n\n          long dp[n][13]; // We'll initialize to 0.\n          int base = 1;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            char c = str1[n-1-i];   // the i-th character from the end (i=0 is last, i=1 is second last, ...) if (c == '?') {\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    for (int next = 0; next < 10; next++) {\n                        int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                        // dp[i][new_rem] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0));\n                        // But note: the original uses a recurrence.\n\n                        // However, we must note that the dp array for the current i is built from the previous i-1. // We have to accumulate for all next.\n\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                int next = c - '0';   // But note: our string is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so c is a letter -> this will be negative or large?\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                    // then add the previous state. }\n            }\n            base = base * 10 % 13;\n          }\n\n        Then the result is dp[n-1][5] (if n>=1) or 0 if n==0? But n is at least 2. However, note: the subtraction '0' from a letter gives a number that is not between 0 and 9. The program doesn't check that. We must do exactly as the Java program. Example: for the string \"No\", \n        n=2. i=0: c = 'o' -> next = 'o' - '0' = 111 - 48 = 63. Then new_rem = (1 * 63 + pre) % 13, for each pre. Then base becomes 1 * 10 % 13 = 10.\n\n        i=1: c = 'N' -> next = 'N' - '0' = 78 - 48 = 30. Then new_rem = (10 * 30 + pre) % 13. Then we add the contributions. We must do the same. But note: the dp initialization: for i=0, the previous state is for i=-1. The original says: (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0)) So for the first character (i=0), we have:\n        if the char is not '?', then for each pre:\n            dp[0][ (base * next + pre) % 13 ] = (pre==0 ? 1 : 0)   [but note: the original adds, but initially it's 0 so we set? Actually, we are adding to the current state which starts at 0. So for each pre, we add either 0 or 1 for pre==0. Actually, the original does:\n\n        dp[i][new_rem] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0));\n\n    So for i=0, we are adding 1 only when pre==0? But note: the inner loop is over pre and next. For each pre and next, we are adding 1 for pre==0? That doesn't seem to depend on next? Actually, it does: we are iterating over next and pre.\n\n    How many times? For each next (0 to 9) and pre (0 to 12). For a fixed pre, we are adding the same value for each next? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the original has the inner loop over next and then pre. So for each pre, and for each next, we do:\n\n        new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13\n        then dp[i][new_rem] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre==0?1:0)) But if i==0, then for every next we do:\n\n        if pre==0: add 1 to new_rem\n        else: add 0. And we do that for every next? So for each next, we are adding 1 to the state (base * next) % 13? And we do that for 10 different next. So we are adding 10 different states?",

So for the first character, the state j gets the count of next such that (base * next) % 13 = j.\n\n    But base is 1 for the first character. So we are counting the next in [0,9] such that next mod 13 = j. Since next is 0..9, we have:\n\n        j=0: next=0 -> 1\n        j=1: next=1 -> 1\n        ...\n        j=9: next=9 -> 1\n        j=10 to 12: 0. So we get 1 for j in [0,9] and 0 for j in [10,12]. But wait: the original does:\n\n        for (pre: 0..12) {\n            for (next: 0..9) {\n                if (c=='?') ...

So we are adding 1 to the state (base * next) % 13. Therefore, for the first character (if not '?') we set state j = 1 for j = (base * next) % 13, and 0 elsewhere. But if the character is '?', we set state j = count of next in [0,9] such that (base * next) % 13 = j.\n\n    So we can implement accordingly.

(pre==0 ? 1 : 0) : dp[i-1][pre];\n                    if (count == 0) continue;\n                    for (int next = 0; next < 10; next++) {\n                        int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                        dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                int next_val = c - '0';   // even if c is a letter, we do this. for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    long count = (i==0) ?

Also, the dp mod MOD (1e9+7) for the counts. However, the second program in the original Java uses:\n\n    dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\nand then mod MOD. We do the same. But note: the base is computed modulo 13: base = base * 10 % 13. We must do modulo 13 for base. Also, the new_rem is mod 13. Now, test the chain:\n\n  Example input for the first program:\n\n      S = \"abc\"\n      T = \"abc\"\n\n  Then the first program: It should output \"Yes\". Then the second program: input = \"Yes\" (n=3)\n\n      Process the string in reverse: 's', 'e', 'Y'\n\n      i=0: c = 's' -> not '?', next_val = 's' - '0' = 115-48 = 67.\n          base = 1. For pre from 0 to 12: \n             if i==0: count = 1 if pre==0, else 0.\n             So only pre=0: \n                 new_rem = (1*67 + 0) % 13 = 67 % 13 = 67 mod13: 67/13=5*13=65, remainder 2 -> so dp[0][2] = 1. Then base = 1*10 %13 = 10.\n\n      i=1: c = 'e' -> next_val = 101-48=53. For pre from 0 to 12: we take from dp[0][pre] (which is 1 at pre=2, 0 elsewhere). For pre=2: \n              new_rem = (10*53 + 2) %13 = (530+2) %13 = 532 %13. Let me compute: 13*40=520, 532-520=12 -> so 12. Then dp[1][12] = 1.\n\n          Then base = 10*10 %13 = 100%13 = 9 (because 13*7=91, 100-91=9)\n\n      i=2: c = 'Y' -> next_val = 89-48=41. For pre from 0 to 12: we take from dp[1][pre] (which is 1 at pre=12, 0 elsewhere). new_rem = (9*41 + 12) %13 = (369+12) %13 = 381 %13.\n          13*29=377, 381-377=4 -> so 4.\n          dp[2][4] = 1. Then result2 = dp[2][5] = 0. Then the third program: input = \"0\" (because result2=0) -> then output = '0'+1 = '1'. So we output '1'. But the original second program would output 0? Then the third program outputs '1'. This is acceptable? We are just simulating. But note: the chain might be arbitrary and the second program is not designed for letters, but we do the same as the Java program. Therefore, we write the C program accordingly. However, the above first program logic in C might be inefficient, but the strings are at most 1000. But note: the inner loops in the second program: for n up to 3, it's only 3*13*10 (for '?') or 3*13 (for fixed) -> acceptable. We'll write the code accordingly. Let me fix the first program's logic: the original Java code:\n\n        for (String s : A) {\n            int sIdx = S.indexOf(s);\n            if (sIdx < 0) continue;\n            String t = String.valueOf(T.charAt(sIdx));\n            int idx = 0;\n            while (idx < S.length()) {\n                if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >= 0) {\n                    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) ! = T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n                        res = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        idx = S.indexOf(s, idx) + 1;\n                    }\n                } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >= 0) {\n                    res = false;\n                    break;\n                } else break;\n            }\n            if (!res) break;\n        } We have to translate the indexOf calls.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are meant to be run in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the third program (atcoder_ABC151_A) simply reads a single character and prints the next character (e.g., 'a' becomes 'b').\n\nBut the first program (atcoder_ABC110_C) outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) expects a string of digits and '?' (as in the example: it processes a string for modulo 13 counting).\n\nHow do we chain them?\n- The first program reads two strings (S and T) and outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n- The second program reads a string (with digits and '?') and outputs a number (mod 1e9+7) which is the count of numbers in the string that, when interpreted with wildcards, form a number mod 13 equal to 5.\n- The third program reads a string and outputs the next character of the first character.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters). The second program expects a string. How can we use \"Yes\" or \"No\" as input to the second program? It doesn't seem to fit because the second program expects a string that may contain digits and '?'.\n\nThis suggests that the chain might not be directly compatible. However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nLooking at the programs:\n\nFile1: atcoder_ABC110_C\n  Input: two lines (first string S, second string T)\n  Output: either \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\nFile2: atcoder_ABC135_D\n  Input: one string (from stdin) - which is the output of the first program? That would be either \"Yes\" or \"No\". But the second program expects a string of digits and '?'. This does not match.\n\nSimilarly, the third program expects a string and outputs a character.\n\nThis indicates that the three programs are not designed to be chained arbitrarily. Therefore, we must reconsider the problem.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nWe must assume that the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program (i.e., two strings S and T). Then the output of the first program (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") becomes the input to the second program. The second program then processes that string (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and produces a number. Then the third program reads that number (as a string? but the third program expects a string and then takes the first character) and outputs the next character.\n\nBut the second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) is designed for a problem about counting modulo 13. It expects a string that might look like \"??2??5\". If we feed it \"Yes\" or \"No\", it will try to process that.\n\nFor example, for the second program:\n  Input: \"Yes\" -> but it contains non-digit and non '?' -> then it would break? Actually, in the second program, if the character is not '?', then it tries to convert to a digit: `int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';` -> for 'Y' (which is 89 in ASCII) then next = 89 - 48 = 41? Then it uses that as a digit? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis indicates that the chain as described might be artificial. However, the problem states that we must chain them.\n\nAlternative interpretation: the entire sequence is run on the same initial input? But the first program reads two strings, the second reads one string, and the third reads one string.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So:\n\nStep 1: Run program1 on the original input (two strings). It produces output A (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\nStep 2: Run program2 on input A (which is a string). It produces output B (a number).\nStep 3: Run program3 on input B (but note: program3 expects a string, so we must convert the number to a string? but the problem says without additional I/O). However, the problem does not specify how the output is passed. We assume that the output of one program is passed as a string to the next.\n\nBut the third program only reads one string. So we must pass the output of the second program as a string to the third.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\nInput to the entire system: the two strings for the first program.\n\nThen:\n  First program: reads two strings -> outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n  Second program: reads the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" (or whatever the first outputs) -> does its DP and outputs a number (mod 1e9+7) -> we must convert this number to a string to pass to the third.\n  Third program: reads a string (which is the string representation of the number) and then outputs the next character of the first character of that string.\n\nBut wait: the third program only reads one string. The output of the second program is a single number, so we can print that number as a string and then the third program reads it.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output. Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\"\n\nSo we are not allowed to actually do I/O in between. Therefore, we must simulate the entire chain in memory.\n\nWe must design:\n\n1. Read the initial input (two strings) for the first program.\n2. Run the logic of the first program to produce a string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") without printing it, but store it in memory.\n3. Use that stored string as the input to the second program. The second program then processes that string and produces a number (a long). We store that number.\n4. Convert the number to a string (without printing) and use that string as the input to the third program.\n5. The third program then processes that string and produces a character, which is the final output.\n\nBut note: the second program is designed for a string of digits and '?'. How will it behave when given \"Yes\" or \"No\"?\n\nWe must run the second program as it is on the string \"Yes\" or \"No\". It will:\n\n- Convert the string to a char array: for \"Yes\": ['Y','e','s'].\n- Then it processes from the last character to the first (because it does `cs.length - 1 - i`).\n\nBut note: the second program expects each character to be either a digit or '?'. In our case, we have letters. So when it encounters a letter, it does:\n  `int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';`\n\nThis will subtract '0' (48) from the character. For 'Y' (ASCII 89) we get 41, for 'e' (101) we get 53, and for 's' (115) we get 67.\n\nThen it uses these numbers as digits? The program doesn't check for non-digit and non '?'. It only checks for '?'. So if the character is not '?', it treats it as a digit (by subtracting '0'). But that digit might be way above 9. Then it does:\n\n  dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\nSo the program will run, but the result is undefined in terms of the original problem. However, we are required to chain the programs as they are.\n\nTherefore, we must implement the exact behavior of the second program even when the input is not digits.\n\nSimilarly, the third program: it reads the string representation of a number (which might be a very long number) and then takes the first character. Then it outputs the next character. For example, if the second program outputs 12345, then the string is \"12345\", the first character is '1', then next character is '2'. But note: the third program does `s.charAt(0) + 1` which is an integer addition. For '1' (49) + 1 = 50, which is then cast to char and printed as '2'. However, if the number is negative? But the modulus is positive, so the number is nonnegative.\n\nBut note: the third program only reads one line. The output of the second program is a single number (so one line).\n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. Read the initial input: two strings (S and T). We assume they are given on two lines.\n2. Run the first program's logic to determine if we should output \"Yes\" or \"No\", but store the result in a string (say, result1).\n3. Use result1 as the input string for the second program.\n4. Run the second program's logic on result1 to compute a number (say, result2). The second program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways modulo 1e9+7. We note that the second program processes the string in reverse.\n5. Convert result2 (a long) to a string (say, result2_str). We must be cautious because the number can be large, but it's modulo 1e9+7, so it's at most 10^9+7, which is 10 digits.\n6. Use result2_str as the input string for the third program.\n7. The third program takes the first character of result2_str, adds 1 to it (as a char) and then outputs the corresponding character.\n\nHowever, note: the third program does `s.charAt(0) + 1` and then prints it with `%c`. This is an integer. For example, if the first character is '0' (ASCII 48), then we get 49, which is '1'. But if the first character is '9' (57) then we get 58 which is ':'. \n\nBut the second program's output is a number. The string representation of the number will be in base 10, so the first character can be a digit from '1' to '9' (unless the number is 0, then '0')? Actually, the second program outputs a nonnegative integer. The smallest is 0, the largest is 1000000006.\n\nSo the first character of the string representation of the number is a digit (if the number has one digit) or the first digit (if multiple). Then we add 1 to that digit's ASCII and print the corresponding character.\n\nBut note: what if the first character is '9'? Then 57+1=58 -> ':'. This is acceptable.\n\nNow, we must write a single C program that does:\n\n- Read two lines (S and T). We must not assume a maximum length? But for C we have to set limits. Let's assume the maximum length for each string is 1000.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read S and T (from stdin).\n2. Run the first program's logic to compute a boolean `res` (true for \"Yes\", false for \"No\"). Then set `result1` to either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n3. Then, take `result1` as the input string for the second program. We'll have to simulate the second program on this string.\n4. The second program uses a DP array of dimensions [n][13] (n is the length of the string). We note that the second program processes the string from last character to first. It also uses a variable `base` that starts at 1 and then becomes (base * 10) % 13 for each next character.\n5. After the DP, the result is `dp[n-1][5]` (if n is the length of the string). Then we have a number (result2).\n6. Convert result2 to a string (using `sprintf` or a custom function, but note: the number is at most 10 digits).\n7. Then, for the third program: take the first character of that string, add 1, and output the corresponding character.\n\nHowever, note: the third program reads one line. But we are passing a string without a newline? Actually, the second program outputs the number without any extra space (just the number). So the string for the third program is the decimal representation of the number.\n\nBut the third program uses `readLine` and then takes the first character. So we only care about the first character of the string representation of the number.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read the first two lines (S and T) from stdin.\n2. Process the first program (using S and T) to get a string: either \"Yes\" or \"No\". We'll store this in a string (say, str1).\n3. Then, we take str1 (the string from step2) and use it as the input for the second program. We simulate the second program on this string to get a long integer (mod 1e9+7).\n4. Convert the long integer to a string (say, str2).\n5. Then, take the first character of str2, add 1, and output that character (as a char) and then we are done.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses modulo 1e9+7 (1000000007). We'll use the same modulo.\n\nWe must be cautious about the DP array: the second program uses a 2D array of size [n][13]. The length n of the input to the second program is either 2 (\"No\") or 3 (\"Yes\"). So n is small (2 or 3). Therefore, we can safely allocate a 2D array for [n][13].\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Step 1: Read S and T. We'll use fgets to read two lines (and remove the newline if present).\n- Step 2: Implement the logic of the first program.\n\n  The first program:\n\n    It has an array A of the 26 lowercase letters.\n    For each letter s in A:\n        if s is not in S, skip.\n        else:\n            Let sIdx = first index of s in S.\n            Then t = T.charAt(sIdx) (the character at the same index in T).\n            Then it checks: at every occurrence of s in S, the corresponding character in T must be t. Also, every occurrence of t in T at the same positions as s in S must match.\n\n    Actually, the code:\n\n        for (String s : A) {\n            int sIdx = S.indexOf(s);\n            if (sIdx < 0) continue;\n            String t = String.valueOf(T.charAt(sIdx));\n            int idx = 0;\n            while (idx < S.length()) {\n                if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >= 0) {\n                    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n                        res = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        idx = S.indexOf(s, idx) + 1;\n                    }\n                } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >= 0) {\n                    res = false;\n                    break;\n                } else break;\n            }\n            if (!res) break;\n        }\n\n    We can reimplement this in C.\n\n- Step 3: The second program:\n\n    We are given a string (str1) which is either \"No\" (2 characters) or \"Yes\" (3 characters).\n\n    We need to simulate the DP:\n\n        long MOD = 1000000007;\n        int n = strlen(str1);\n        // We'll create a dp array: dp[i][j] for i in [0, n-1] and j in [0,12]\n        // But note: the original Java program processes the string from last character to first.\n\n        // We'll create an array for the current dp state? Actually, the original uses a 2D array for the entire dp.\n\n        Steps in the second program:\n\n          long dp[n][13]; // We'll initialize to 0.\n          int base = 1;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            char c = str1[n-1-i];   // the i-th character from the end (i=0 is last, i=1 is second last, ...)\n            if (c == '?') {\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    for (int next = 0; next < 10; next++) {\n                        int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                        // dp[i][new_rem] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0));\n                        // But note: the original uses a recurrence.\n\n                        // However, we must note that the dp array for the current i is built from the previous i-1.\n\n                        // We have to accumulate for all next.\n\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                int next = c - '0';   // But note: our string is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so c is a letter -> this will be negative or large?\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                    // then add the previous state.\n                }\n            }\n            base = base * 10 % 13;\n          }\n\n        Then the result is dp[n-1][5] (if n>=1) or 0 if n==0? But n is at least 2.\n\n    However, note: the subtraction '0' from a letter gives a number that is not between 0 and 9. The program doesn't check that. We must do exactly as the Java program.\n\n    Example: for the string \"No\", \n        n=2.\n        i=0: c = 'o' -> next = 'o' - '0' = 111 - 48 = 63.\n        Then new_rem = (1 * 63 + pre) % 13, for each pre.\n\n    Then base becomes 1 * 10 % 13 = 10.\n\n        i=1: c = 'N' -> next = 'N' - '0' = 78 - 48 = 30.\n        Then new_rem = (10 * 30 + pre) % 13.\n\n    Then we add the contributions.\n\n    We must do the same.\n\n    But note: the dp initialization: for i=0, the previous state is for i=-1. The original says: (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0))\n\n    So for the first character (i=0), we have:\n        if the char is not '?', then for each pre:\n            dp[0][ (base * next + pre) % 13 ] = (pre==0 ? 1 : 0)   [but note: the original adds, but initially it's 0 so we set? Actually, we are adding to the current state which starts at 0. So for each pre, we add either 0 or 1 for pre==0.\n\n    Actually, the original does:\n\n        dp[i][new_rem] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0));\n\n    So for i=0, we are adding 1 only when pre==0? But note: the inner loop is over pre and next. For each pre and next, we are adding 1 for pre==0? That doesn't seem to depend on next? Actually, it does: we are iterating over next and pre.\n\n    How many times? For each next (0 to 9) and pre (0 to 12). For a fixed pre, we are adding the same value for each next? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the original has the inner loop over next and then pre. So for each pre, and for each next, we do:\n\n        new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13\n        then dp[i][new_rem] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre==0?1:0))\n\n    But if i==0, then for every next we do:\n\n        if pre==0: add 1 to new_rem\n        else: add 0.\n\n    And we do that for every next? So for each next, we are adding 1 to the state (base * next) % 13? And we do that for 10 different next. So we are adding 10 different states? Actually, no: because for each next, we are adding 1 to the state (base * next + 0) % 13.\n\n    But note: the inner loop over pre is outside the next loop? Actually, no: the original has:\n\n        for (pre: 0..12)\n            for (next: 0..9)\n\n    So for i==0 and for a fixed next, we are only adding 1 when pre==0? And we do that for every next. So we are effectively adding 1 for each next to the state (base * next) % 13.\n\n    So for the first character, the state j gets the count of next such that (base * next) % 13 = j.\n\n    But base is 1 for the first character. So we are counting the next in [0,9] such that next mod 13 = j. Since next is 0..9, we have:\n\n        j=0: next=0 -> 1\n        j=1: next=1 -> 1\n        ...\n        j=9: next=9 -> 1\n        j=10 to 12: 0.\n\n    So we get 1 for j in [0,9] and 0 for j in [10,12].\n\n    But wait: the original does:\n\n        for (pre: 0..12) {\n            for (next: 0..9) {\n                if (c=='?') ... OR if not, then use the fixed next.\n            }\n        }\n\n    Actually, for the fixed character (not '?'), we don't iterate over next from 0 to 9, but use the fixed next (from the char). So for the first character (if it is not '?') we do:\n\n        for (pre: 0..12) {\n            int next = ...; // fixed\n            new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n            dp[0][new_rem] += (pre==0?1:0);   // because i==0\n        }\n\n    But note: we are iterating pre from 0 to 12, and for each pre we are adding 1 only when pre==0? So we are adding 1 to the state (base * next) % 13.\n\n    Therefore, for the first character (if not '?') we set state j = 1 for j = (base * next) % 13, and 0 elsewhere.\n\n    But if the character is '?', we set state j = count of next in [0,9] such that (base * next) % 13 = j.\n\n    So we can implement accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the original uses a 2D dp for the entire length. We can do:\n\n        long dp[n][13];\n        // initialize all to 0.\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < 13; j++) {\n                dp[i][j] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        Then, base = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            char c = str1[n-1-i];   // the i-th character from the end (starting at 0)\n\n            if (c == '?') {\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    // For the previous state: if i==0 then we use (pre==0?1:0) for the previous state at pre.\n                    // But if i>0, then we use dp[i-1][pre]\n                    long count = (i==0) ? (pre==0 ? 1 : 0) : dp[i-1][pre];\n                    if (count == 0) continue;\n                    for (int next = 0; next < 10; next++) {\n                        int new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n                        dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                int next_val = c - '0';   // even if c is a letter, we do this.\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n                    long count = (i==0) ? (pre==0 ? 1 : 0) : dp[i-1][pre];\n                    if (count == 0) continue;\n                    int new_rem = (base * next_val + pre) % 13;\n                    dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                }\n            }\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13;\n        }\n\n        Then the result is dp[n-1][5]   // because we want mod 5? Actually, the original prints dp[dp.length-1][5].\n\n    But note: the dp array index: the last character is at i = n-1.\n\n    However, in the loop, we are processing the entire string. So the state after processing all n characters is stored in dp[n-1][*].\n\n    Therefore, result2 = dp[n-1][5] % MOD.\n\n    But note: we are modding at every step.\n\n- Step 4: Convert result2 to a string. We can use `sprintf`:\n\n        char str2[20]; // enough for a long number (max 19 digits for 64-bit, but our number is mod 1e9+7, so 10 digits)\n        sprintf(str2, \"%ld\", result2);\n\n    However, note: the modulus is 1000000007, so the number is between 0 and 1000000006.\n\n- Step 5: The third program: take the first character of str2 and output (char)(str2[0] + 1).\n\n    But note: the third program in Java does:\n\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\n    This is adding 1 to the char value (which is an integer). Then it prints the integer as a char.\n\n    So in C:\n\n        char c0 = str2[0];\n        char output_char = c0 + 1;\n        printf(\"%c\\n\", output_char);   // But note: the Java program does not output a newline? Actually, it does: the Java program uses printf with \"%c\", which doesn't add a newline. But the third program does not output a newline? Let me check:\n\n        The third program: atcoder_ABC151_A: \n            System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\n        This prints one character without a newline.\n\n        However, the problem says the entire chain must behave identically. The first program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println` which adds a newline. Similarly, the second program uses `System.out.println` which adds a newline. The third does not.\n\n        But in our chain, we are not printing the intermediate results. We are only printing the final output. And the final output is one character without a newline.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are to produce the same behavior.\n\n        The original chain:\n\n          Program1: outputs \"Yes\\n\" or \"No\\n\" (because println)\n          Program2: reads that (including the newline? Actually, the second program uses `sc.next()` which reads tokens (by default, tokens are delimited by whitespace). So it would read \"Yes\" without the newline? Actually, `sc.next()` in Java uses a Scanner that by default breaks on whitespace. So it would read the next token. The token \"Yes\" or \"No\" is the entire token (without the newline). The newline remains in the input buffer? Then the second program does not read the newline.\n\n          Then the second program outputs a number and a newline (because println).\n\n          Then the third program reads one line? The entire line is the number (with the newline at the end? or without?) -> the third program uses `readLine`, which reads a line (including the newline? but then the line is stored without the newline). So the string for the third program is the number without the newline.\n\n        But in our simulation:\n\n          We are not including newlines in the intermediate strings. For the first program, we store \"Yes\" or \"No\" without a newline. Then the second program uses that string (without newline). Then the second program produces a number, and we convert the number to a string (without newline). Then the third program uses that string (without newline). Then we output one character without a newline.\n\n        However, the original third program does not output a newline. So our output is one character without a newline.\n\n        But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The entire chain output is one character without a newline.\n\n        However, the first two programs in the original chain output newlines. But in our chain, we are not outputting those intermediate results. We are only outputting the final result. So the final output should be the same as the third program's output in the chain.\n\n        Therefore, we output one character without a newline.\n\n        But wait: the original chain would output:\n\n          Program1: \"Yes\\n\"\n          Program2: \"12345\\n\"   (for example)\n          Program3: '2'\n\n        So the entire output would be:\n\n          Yes\n          12345\n          2\n\n        But if we run the programs sequentially in a shell, the output would be:\n\n          $ java Program1\n          Yes\n          $ java Program2\n          12345\n          $ java Program3\n          2\n\n        And the third program's output does not have a newline? Then the shell would look like:\n\n          2$\n\n        without a newline.\n\n        However, in a terminal, the prompt would appear immediately after the 2.\n\n        But the problem says to write a single C program that produces the same behavior. We are only required to output the final output? And the final output is the output of the last program.\n\n        Therefore, we output one character without a newline.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java does not output a newline. So we do the same.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll write the entire program in C.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    #include <stdbool.h>\n\n    #define MOD 1000000007L\n\n    int main() {\n        // Step 1: Read S and T (two lines)\n        char S[1001], T[1001];\n        fgets(S, 1001, stdin);\n        fgets(T, 1001, stdin);\n\n        // Remove newlines if present\n        S[strcspn(S, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';\n        T[strcspn(T, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';\n\n        // Step 2: First program logic\n        bool res = true;\n        // We'll iterate over each lowercase letter\n        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {\n            char *pos = strchr(S, c);\n            if (pos == NULL) continue;\n            int idx0 = pos - S;\n            char t_char = T[idx0];   // the corresponding char in T at the first occurrence of c in S.\n            // Now, we need to check: every occurrence of c in S must correspond to t_char in T, and every occurrence of t_char in T must be at a position where S has c?

Also, the dp mod MOD (1e9+7) for the counts.\n\nHowever, the second program in the original Java uses:\n\n    dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\nand then mod MOD.\n\nWe do the same.\n\nBut note: the base is computed modulo 13: base = base * 10 % 13.\n\nWe must do modulo 13 for base.\n\nAlso, the new_rem is mod 13.\n\nNow, test the chain:\n\n  Example input for the first program:\n\n      S = \"abc\"\n      T = \"abc\"\n\n  Then the first program: \n      It should output \"Yes\".\n\n  Then the second program: input = \"Yes\" (n=3)\n\n      Process the string in reverse: 's', 'e', 'Y'\n\n      i=0: c = 's' -> not '?', next_val = 's' - '0' = 115-48 = 67.\n          base = 1.\n          For pre from 0 to 12: \n             if i==0: count = 1 if pre==0, else 0.\n             So only pre=0: \n                 new_rem = (1*67 + 0) % 13 = 67 % 13 = 67 mod13: 67/13=5*13=65, remainder 2 -> so dp[0][2] = 1.\n\n          Then base = 1*10 %13 = 10.\n\n      i=1: c = 'e' -> next_val = 101-48=53.\n          For pre from 0 to 12: we take from dp[0][pre] (which is 1 at pre=2, 0 elsewhere).\n          For pre=2: \n              new_rem = (10*53 + 2) %13 = (530+2) %13 = 532 %13.\n          Let me compute: 13*40=520, 532-520=12 -> so 12.\n          Then dp[1][12] = 1.\n\n          Then base = 10*10 %13 = 100%13 = 9 (because 13*7=91, 100-91=9)\n\n      i=2: c = 'Y' -> next_val = 89-48=41.\n          For pre from 0 to 12: we take from dp[1][pre] (which is 1 at pre=12, 0 elsewhere).\n          new_rem = (9*41 + 12) %13 = (369+12) %13 = 381 %13.\n          13*29=377, 381-377=4 -> so 4.\n          dp[2][4] = 1.\n\n      Then result2 = dp[2][5] = 0.\n\n  Then the third program: input = \"0\" (because result2=0) -> then output = '0'+1 = '1'. So we output '1'.\n\nBut the original second program would output 0? Then the third program outputs '1'.\n\nThis is acceptable? We are just simulating.\n\nBut note: the chain might be arbitrary and the second program is not designed for letters, but we do the same as the Java program.\n\nTherefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\nHowever, the above first program logic in C might be inefficient, but the strings are at most 1000.\n\nBut note: the inner loops in the second program: for n up to 3, it's only 3*13*10 (for '?') or 3*13 (for fixed) -> acceptable.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nLet me fix the first program's logic: the original Java code:\n\n        for (String s : A) {\n            int sIdx = S.indexOf(s);\n            if (sIdx < 0) continue;\n            String t = String.valueOf(T.charAt(sIdx));\n            int idx = 0;\n            while (idx < S.length()) {\n                if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >= 0) {\n                    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n                        res = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        idx = S.indexOf(s, idx) + 1;\n                    }\n                } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >= 0) {\n                    res = false;\n                    break;\n                } else break;\n            }\n            if (!res) break;\n        }\n\nWe have to translate the indexOf calls.\n\nWe did:\n\n   We iterate for each letter c from 'a' to 'z'\n\n   We find the first occurrence of c in S (to get the corresponding T char).\n\n   Then we set idx=0 and:\n\n        while (idx < strlen(S)) {\n            s_occur = strchr(S+idx, c);   -> this finds the next occurrence of c in S starting at idx.\n\n            If found, then we get the index s_index.\n\n            Then we check: the next occurrence of t_char in T starting at idx must be at the same index.\n\n            How to get the next occurrence of t_char in T? We do: t_occur = strchr(T+idx, t_char)\n\n            Then we compare the indices? But note: the original uses:\n\n                if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx))\n\n            So we need the index of the next occurrence of t_char in T starting at idx.\n\n            Then if s_index != t_index, then break with false.\n\n            Then we set idx = s_index+1.\n\n        If not found in S, then we check: is there any occurrence of t_char in T starting at idx? If yes, then false.\n\n        Else break.\n\nBut note: the original also breaks out of the inner while loop if there's a mismatch.\n\nWe implemented that.\n\nBut there is a problem: the original uses `indexOf` which returns the first occurrence at or after the index. Our `strchr(S+idx, c)` returns a pointer to the first occurrence starting at idx, which is what we want.\n\nBut note: what if the string has multiple null terminators? We assume standard C strings.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nHowever, we must note: the first program in the original uses the array A of 26 letters. We iterate from 'a' to 'z'. That's the same.\n\nLet me test the first program with S=\"abc\", T=\"abc\": it should be \"Yes\".\n\nFor c='a': \n   first occurrence at 0 -> t_char = 'a'\n   then:\n        idx=0: \n            s_occur = S+0 -> 'a' at index0.\n            Then we find the next occurrence of 'a' in T starting at 0: at index0 -> so equal.\n            Then idx = 0+1 = 1.\n        Then at idx=1: \n            s_occur = strchr(S+1, 'a') -> not found? because S+1 is \"bc\".\n            Then we check: in T, is there an 'a' at or after index1? -> no (because T is \"abc\", so the next 'a' is at 0, which is before 1). But we are starting at 1: so no? \n            Then we break the inner while? and move to next letter.\n\n   Then for c='b': same -> yes.\n   Then for c='c': same -> yes.\n\n   So res remains true.\n\nAnother test: S=\"a\", T=\"b\"\n\n   For c='a': \n        s_occur at 0 -> t_char = 'b'\n        Then we check: at idx=0, in S: next 'a' at 0, in T: next 'b' at 0 -> same? so then set idx=1.\n        Then at idx=1: no more 'a' in S. Then we check: in T, is there a 'b' at idx=1? -> no (T is \"b\", so only at 0) -> so break inner while without setting res=false.\n\n        Then we move to next letter? but then res remains true? and output \"Yes\".\n\n        But this is wrong: because the mapping: \n            S: a -> T: b: that's one mapping.\n            But also, what about the letter 'b' in T? It must be mapped from S? Actually, we are iterating over the letters in S. The letter 'b' in T is not checked? \n\n        The original program: it iterates over every letter in the alphabet. For the letter 'b' in the alphabet, we check S: is there a 'b'? In S=\"a\", there is no 'b'. So we skip.\n\n        Then the program outputs \"Yes\".\n\n        However, the condition is: \n          For every character in S, we require that if we map the character to the corresponding character in T (by position) then the same character in S must always map to the same character in T. And also, the same character in T must be mapped from the same character in S? \n\n        Actually, the condition is that the mapping from S to T is a function that is one-to-one? Actually, it is about the mapping being consistent for each letter in S and also the mapping being consistent for the image in T.\n\n        The original condition: \n          For a letter s in S, we require that every occurrence of s in S maps to the same letter in T (say, t). \n          And also, we require that every occurrence of t in T must be mapped from an occurrence of s in S? \n\n        How? The code: \n          It checks: when we have an occurrence of s in S at index i, then T[i] must be t.\n          And when we have an occurrence of t in T at index j, then S[j] must be s? \n\n        Actually, the code does not check that. It checks: \n          The next occurrence of s in S (starting at idx) must be at the same index as the next occurrence of t in T (starting at idx). \n\n        This ensures that the positions of s in S are exactly the positions of t in T? \n\n        Example: S=\"aa\", T=\"ab\"\n          For s='a': \n             first occurrence: index0 -> t_char = 'a'\n             Then: \n                 idx=0: \n                    next occurrence of 'a' in S: at 0 -> in T, at index0 we have 'a' -> so same? then set idx=1.\n                 idx=1:\n                    next occurrence of 'a' in S: at 1 -> in T, at index1 we have 'b' -> so we check: the next occurrence of 'a' in T starting at 1? -> not found -> so the condition fails? \n\n        Actually, the code: \n            if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >=0) -> true (index1)\n            then if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx)) -> \n                T.indexOf('a', 1) = -1? \n                So the condition: if (1 != -1) -> true -> so res = false.\n\n        So the condition fails.\n\n        Therefore, our C code must do the same.\n\n        In our C code for the example S=\"a\", T=\"b\":\n\n          For c='a': \n             s_occur = found at 0 -> t_char = 'b'\n             Then at idx=0:\n                 s_occur = found at 0 -> then we check the next occurrence of 'b' in T starting at 0: at index0 -> so they are equal (both 0) -> so we set idx=1.\n             Then at idx=1: \n                 s_occur = strchr(S+1, 'a') -> NULL -> then we check: is there a 'b' in T starting at 1? -> no -> so we break the inner while without setting res=false.\n\n          Then we move to next letters? and then output \"Yes\".\n\n        But wait: the original Java code would do:\n\n            for the letter 'a': \n                sIdx = 0 -> t = \"b\"\n                idx=0: \n                    s_occur = S.indexOf('a',0)=0\n                    then T.indexOf('b',0)=0 -> so they are equal -> then idx=1.\n                then at idx=1: \n                    s_occur = S.indexOf('a',1) = -1 -> then check: T.indexOf('b',1) = -1 -> so break the inner while.\n\n            Then the next letter: 'b' to 'z': skip.\n\n            Then output \"Yes\".\n\n        So our C code matches.\n\n        However, the condition for the mapping being a bijection? It is not checked for letters that do not appear in S. So the mapping is only defined for the letters that appear in S. And the condition is that the mapping is consistent for the letters that appear in S? and also that the image of a letter in S does not appear in T at a position that is not mapped from that letter? \n\n        Actually, the condition we check is: the positions of each letter s in S are exactly the positions of the corresponding t in T. So if there is a t in T at a position that is not mapped from s? then when we process the letter that maps to t (if any) we will catch the inconsistency? \n\n        But note: we are iterating over s in the alphabet that appear in S. We don't iterate over letters that do not appear in S. So if T has a letter that is not the image of any s in S, then we don't check? \n\n        Example: S=\"a\", T=\"bc\"\n          For s='a': \n             s_occur at 0 -> t_char = 'b'\n             Then we check: \n                 at idx=0: \n                    S: next 'a' at 0 -> T: next 'b' at 0 -> so set idx=1.\n                 then at idx=1: no more 'a' in S -> then check: in T, is there a 'b' at or after 1? -> no -> so break inner while.\n\n          Then we don't check the letter 'c' in T? \n\n          The original program: it doesn't check the letter 'c' because it doesn't appear in S? \n\n          But the condition: the mapping must be from S to T and also the mapping must be a function and the inverse must be a function? \n\n          Actually, the condition is that the mapping is a function from the set of characters in S to the set of characters in T, and also the mapping is injective? \n\n          The problem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc110/tasks/abc110_c\n\n          It says: we can rearrange the letters of S arbitrarily. Then we want to know if we can change S to T by a permutation of the letters. So the condition is that the frequency of each letter in S must be the same as the frequency of the corresponding letter in T? \n\n          Actually, no: we are allowed to change every occurrence of a particular letter to any letter, but the same letter must be changed to the same letter. So the mapping must be a function. And also, we are not allowed to map two different letters to the same letter? \n\n          Why? Because if we map two different letters to the same letter, then we cannot revert? \n\n          Actually, the transformation is: we choose a permutation f of the 26 letters, then change every character x in S to f(x). Then we get T. Therefore, f must be a bijection. \n\n          Therefore, the condition: \n            For every distinct character x in S, the positions of x in S must be the same as the positions of f(x) in T? \n\n          But note: the mapping f is applied to every character. So if we have two characters x and y in S, then f(x) and f(y) must be distinct? \n\n          How to check? \n            Condition 1: for each x in S, all the positions of x in S must be mapped to the same f(x) in T.\n            Condition 2: the mapping f must be injective: if x != y, then f(x) != f(y). \n\n          But the original program does not check Condition 2? \n\n          Example: S=\"aa\", T=\"ab\": \n            Condition 1: for x='a', we map to f('a')? At the first occurrence we get 'a', at the second occurrence we get 'b'. This violates Condition 1.\n\n          So Condition 1 fails and the program outputs \"No\".\n\n          Another example: S=\"ab\", T=\"aa\": \n            Condition 1: \n                for 'a': map to 'a' -> then the positions of 'a' in S: [0] -> in T: at 0 we have 'a', at 1 we have 'a'. But we also have the condition: for the letter 'a' in T, we would check? Actually, we don't check because we only iterate over letters that appear in S. \n                for 'b': in S: position1 -> in T: at position1, we have 'a'. So we set t_char = 'a'. \n                Then we check: \n                    For 'b' in S: \n                        at idx=0: the next occurrence of 'b' in S is at index1 -> in T, the next occurrence of 'a' (which is the image) at idx=0 is at index0? -> so the next occurrence of the image 'a' in T is at index0, but the next occurrence of 'b' in S is at index1 -> they are not the same -> so Condition 1 fails? \n\n          Actually, the condition we check is: \n            For a letter x in S, the next occurrence of x in S starting at idx must be at the same index as the next occurrence of f(x) in T starting at idx.\n\n          This ensures that the positions of x in S are exactly the positions of f(x) in T. \n\n          So Condition 1: the positions of x in S are the same as the positions of f(x) in T. \n\n          But note: if Condition 1 holds for every x in S, then Condition 2 (injectivity) is automatically satisfied? Why? \n            Suppose x and y are distinct and f(x)=f(y)=z. Then the positions of x in S are the positions of z in T, and the positions of y in S are the positions of z in T. Then the positions of z in T are the union of the positions of x and y in S. But then when we check x: we require that the positions of x in S are exactly the positions of z in T? -> no, because the positions of z in T include the positions of y as well. \n\n          Example: S=\"ab\", T=\"aa\": \n            For x='a': positions in S: [0], positions of z (f(a)) in T: [0,1] -> Condition 1 fails for x='a'? \n\n          But in our program, for x='a': \n              at idx=0: \n                  next occurrence of 'a' in S: 0 -> next occurrence of 'a' in T: 0 -> so set idx=1.\n              at idx=1: \n                  next occurrence of 'a' in S: not found -> then check: in T, is there an 'a' at or after 1? yes (at1) -> so Condition 1 fails? \n\n          Actually, the condition for x='a' fails at the second step: when we set idx=1, we then check: no more 'a' in S, but there is an 'a' in T at idx=1 -> so we set res=false.\n\n          Therefore, Condition 1 for x='a' fails.\n\n          So we output \"No\".\n\n          Therefore, Condition 1 is sufficient to check that the mapping is a bijection? \n\n          Actually, Condition 1: for each x in S, the positions of x in S are exactly the positions of f(x) in T. \n          Then, the mapping f is defined for every x that appears in S, and the image of x is f(x). And the sets of positions for distinct x are disjoint? and the union of the positions of f(x) over x must cover the entire T? \n\n          But note: T is the same length as S. And the positions of the f(x) for different x are disjoint? because they are defined by the positions of x in S (which are disjoint). And the union is the entire T? because every character in T must be the image of some x? \n\n          Actually, we don't check that every character in T is covered? \n\n          Example: S=\"a\", T=\"ab\": \n            Condition 1 for x='a': \n                positions of 'a' in S: [0] -> in T, the next occurrence of f('a') (which is T[0]='a') at idx=0: index0 -> then we set idx=1.\n                Then at idx=1: no more 'a' in S -> then check: in T, is there an 'a' at or after 1? -> no -> so Condition 1 holds for 'a'.\n            Then for x='b'? we skip because 'b' is not in S.\n            Then we output \"Yes\".\n\n          But this is wrong: because we cannot map S=\"a\" to T=\"ab\" (they have different lengths? but the problem states that S and T are the same length? \n\n          Actually, the input: we read two lines. The problem says: \"We assume they are given on two lines\" and we remove the newline. So the strings S and T are the same length? \n\n          The problem: the original Java program: \n                String S = sc.nextLine();\n                String T = sc.nextLine();\n          And then they are of the same length? \n\n          The problem at AtCoder: \n            Constraints: 1 <= |S|=|T| <= 200000.\n\n          So they are the same length.\n\n          Therefore, in S=\"a\", T=\"ab\": is not possible because |S| = 1, |T| = 2 -> so they are different? \n\n          So our program does not need to handle that.\n\n          Therefore, we assume |S| = |T|.\n\n          Then the example S=\"a\", T=\"ab\" is not possible. \n\n          But what if S and T are the same length? Then the condition we check (Condition 1 for every x in S) ensures that the mapping is a bijection? \n\n          Actually, the mapping f is defined on the set of letters that appear in S. The condition: for each x in S, the set of positions of x in S is the same as the set of positions of f(x) in T. Then the entire T is covered? because the positions of T are partitioned by the images of the x's? \n\n          And also, the mapping f is injective? because if two different x and y map to the same z, then the positions of x and y in S would both be the positions of z in T? so the set of positions of z in T would be the union of the positions of x and y, which is not equal to the set of positions of x? (unless y doesn't appear, but then the sets would be different). \n\n          Actually, if x and y both appear in S and f(x)=f(y)=z, then the set of positions of x in S is the set of positions of z in T? and the set of positions of y in S is the set of positions of z in T? -> then the set of positions of x and y are the same? -> but that is only possible if x=y? \n\n          Therefore, Condition 1 implies that the mapping is injective (on the set of letters that appear in S). \n\n          And the entire T is covered? because the positions in T that we consider are exactly the positions of the images of the letters that appear in S? and since the sets of positions of the images are disjoint? and the union is the entire set of indices? \n\n          So Condition 1 is sufficient.\n\n          Therefore, our C code for the first program is correct.\n\nWe'll write the C code accordingly.\n\nBut note: the original first program uses an array A of 26 letters. We iterate from 'a' to 'z'. That is the same.\n\nWe'll now write the complete C program.\n\nNote: We must be cautious for the second program: the base might be negative? We do mod 13: we take modulo 13 and ensure nonnegative.\n\nBut in C, the modulo operator for negative numbers is implementation defined. We use nonnegative base.\n\nWe do: base = (base * 10) % 13; \n  But base is nonnegative? Initially 1. Then multiplied by 10 mod13: always nonnegative.\n\nSimilarly, new_rem = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n  But base, next, pre are nonnegative, so it's nonnegative.\n\nBut modulo in C for nonnegative numbers is safe.\n\nWe'll write the code.\n\nLet me test with a small example for the second program: input \"??\" (which is two '?'):\n\n  n=2.\n\n  i=0: c = '?' -> then for pre=0: count=1 (if pre==0) -> then for next=0 to 9: \n        new_rem = (1*next + 0) %13 = next %13 -> so we add 1 for each next in [0,9] -> so dp[0][0..9] = 1, and dp[0][10..12]=0.\n        Then base = 1*10 %13 = 10.\n\n  i=1: c = '?' -> then for pre=0 to 12: \n        for each pre, we have count = dp[0][pre] (which is 1 for pre in [0,9] and 0 otherwise).\n        Then for each next=0 to 9: \n             new_rem = (10*next + pre) %13.\n        Then we add 1 for each (pre, next) pair.\n\n        How many? 10*10=100. But we are accumulating per new_rem.\n\n        The result: dp[1][j] = the number of (pre, next) such that (10*next + pre) %13 = j.\n\n        Then the final result = dp[1][5].\n\n        We then output that number mod MOD.\n\n        Then the third program: we convert that number to a string and output the first char +1.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nOne last note: the first program uses the entire alphabet. We iterate from 'a' to 'z'. But what if the string has uppercase? The problem constraints: the original problem at AtCoder for the first program says:\n\n    Constraints: 1 <= |S| = |T| <= 200000, and S, T consist of lowercase letters.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut our first program in C: we are iterating from 'a' to 'z'. And the input is lowercase.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nWe'll write the code.\n\nNote: the second program input (result1) is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which has uppercase. But the original second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) is for a string that may contain uppercase? The problem constraints for the second program: \n\n    Constraints: The string contains digits and '?'.\n\nSo the original second program is not designed for uppercase. But we are required to chain the programs. So we run the second program as is on \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are uppercase.\n\nWe do the same in C.\n\nCode:"
