In the input, the parent of node0 was originally given as x, then we subtracted 1. So if the original parent was 1 (so as[0] = 0) then we don't increment. If the original parent was 2 (so as[0] = 1) then we increment. Actually, the Java code: \n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    j = as.get(i);   // which is the input minus one\n                    if (0 < i) {\n                        lists.get(j).add(i);\n                    } else if (0 < j) {\n                        answer++;\n                    }\n                } So in C:\n\n                if (i==0 && j>0) then answer++.

The DFS function:\n\n                int dfs(int a, int pre, int** children, int* next_sibling, int k, int* answer) {\n                    int h = 0;\n                    for (int child = children[a]; child ! = -1; child = next_sibling[child]) {\n                        int nh = dfs(child, a, children, next_sibling, k, answer); if (nh > h) h = nh;\n                    }\n                    if (pre != 0 && h == k-1) {\n                        (*answer)++;\n                        return 0;\n                    } else {\n                        return h+1;\n                    }\n                } However, note: the DFS in Java returns the height and increments the answer in the middle. But the DFS in the Java code does:\n\n                for each child i in the list for a:\n                    h = max(h, dfs(i, a))\n\n                then:\n                    if (pre !=0 and h == k-1) then set h=0 and answer++.\n                    else h++\n\n                return h.\n\n            We'll do the same.

We can build an array:\n\n                                                int* parent_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                                                parent_arr[0] = 0; // because the root is called with parent=0?\n                                                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                                                    parent_arr[i] = as[i]; // but note: as[i] is the parent index (which is the index in the 0-indexed array) of node i?\n                                                } Actually, the parent of node i is as[i]. So we can do:\n\n                                                if (node != 0) { // because the root has parent_arr[0]=0? Actually, the root has parent_arr[0] = as[0] (which is the input). We don't have a parent for the root? Actually, the condition in the Java code: \n                                                if (0 < pre && h == k-1) So we check: if the parent is not 0? Then for the root, we skip. How about we store for each node the parent? Actually, we can set:\n\n                                                parent_arr[0] = 0;   // because in the DFS call, pre=0. Then for any node, we can check: if parent_arr[node] != 0? But note: the parent of a non-root node might be 0? For example, a direct child of the root has parent 0 (the root). Then we do the condition? Yes. So:\n\n                                                if (node != 0) { // because the root has parent_arr[0]=0, but we skip the root anyway? Actually, we are processing the root at the end. We want to do:\n\n                                                    if (parent_arr[node] ! = 0) { ... } But wait: the condition is on the parent of the current node? Actually, the condition in the DFS: \n                                                    if (0 < pre && h == k-1) \n\n                                                Here, pre is the parent of the current node. In our iterative DFS, we have the parent_arr[node] (which is the parent index). We want to know: is parent_arr[node] ! = 0? But note: the root's parent is set to 0. For any other node, parent_arr[node] is the index of the parent. The condition is: if the parent is not the root? Actually, the condition checks: if the parent is not 0? But 0 is the root? So:\n\n                                                    if (parent_arr[node] ! = 0 && maxh == k-1) {\n                                                        // then we reset the height to 0 and increment the answer\n                                                        h_arr[node] = 0;\n                                                        answer++;\n                                                    } else {\n                                                        h_arr[node] = maxh + 1;\n                                                    }\n\n                                            However, wait: in the Java code, the condition is inside the DFS after the for-loop.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. However, note that each program reads from standard input and writes to standard output. The requirement is to chain them such that the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nBut note: The second program (codeforces_678_B) reads an integer `y` and then prints an integer. The third program (atcoder_ABC164_D) reads a string `S`.\n\nHowever, the first program (atcoder_AGC004_D) reads two integers `n` and `k` and then a list of `n` integers. It outputs a single integer.\n\nThe second program reads a single integer (the year). The third program reads a string.\n\nTherefore, the chain is:\n  Input for the first program: two integers and then a list of `n` integers.\n  Output of the first program: a single integer.\n\n  The second program takes that integer as input and outputs another integer.\n\n  The third program takes the output of the second program as a string? But note: the second program outputs an integer and the third program expects a string of digits.\n\nHowever, the third program expects a string of digits (like \"1819\") and then processes it. The second program outputs an integer (a year) which is a number. We can convert that integer to a string of digits to feed to the third program.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program. The second program reads an integer and then outputs an integer. Then the third program must read a string. Therefore, we must convert the integer output of the second program into a string for the third.\n\nHowever, the entire sequence must be implemented in a single C program without intermediate I/O. We will:\n\n1. Read the initial input (for the first program) from stdin.\n2. Process the first program (without printing, but storing the result in a variable).\n3. Use that result as input for the second program (without reading from stdin, but using the stored value).\n4. Process the second program and store its result.\n5. Convert the result of the second program to a string and use it as the input for the third program.\n6. The third program processes that string and then the final result is printed.\n\nBut note: the first program (atcoder_AGC004_D) has a complex structure. We must translate it to C. Similarly, the other two.\n\nSteps:\n\nWe will combine the three programs into one C program. We'll have:\n\n- The main function that reads the initial input (for the first program) and then sequentially calls the three programs.\n\nHowever, note the first program (atcoder_AGC004_D) uses a thread with a large stack. In C, we can avoid that by not using recursion too deep? Or we can increase the stack size? But the problem does not specify the environment. We'll assume the recursion in the first program is necessary and we must handle it. We can use iterative DFS to avoid stack overflow? But the problem says to behave identically.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the stack size in C if needed, but that is non-portable. We'll try to use recursion and hope the stack is big enough? Or we can use an iterative DFS.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically\".\n\nWe will translate each program into a function that does the same computation.\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n1. First program (atcoder_AGC004_D):\n\n   It reads:\n        n, k\n        then n integers (each integer is decreased by 1 when stored in `as`)\n\n   It builds a tree (adjacency list) where:\n        For i from 0 to n-1, the parent of node i is as[i] (except node0, which is the root? but note node0's parent is as[0]; but the root should be node0? Actually, the root is node0 because the first integer is the parent of node0? Let me see: the problem says node0 is the capital? The code: for node0 (i=0) we have j = as.get(0). Then if i>0 we add, but for i=0 we do: if 0 < i -> false, then else if 0 < j -> then we increment answer by 1. So j (the parent of node0) is non-zero? Actually, the root node (node0) is supposed to have parent -1? But the input: the first integer is the parent of node0? But the problem subtracts 1 from each input.\n\n   Actually, the input for node0 is given and then subtracted by 1. The code says: if i==0 and j>=0 (because j = as.get(0) which is an integer subtracted by 1) and if j>0 then we do answer++? \n\n   The algorithm:\n\n        It builds a graph: for each node i (from 0 to n-1), we have an adjacency list for node j (the parent) that includes i? Actually, the graph is built as:\n            lists = list of n empty lists.\n            for i from 0 to n-1:\n                j = as.get(i)   [this is the parent of i?]\n                if i>0:\n                    then we add i to the list of children of j? (lists.get(j).add(i))\n                else (i==0) and if j>0 (meaning the parent of node0 is not node0? and not negative) then we do answer++.\n\n        Then we do a DFS from node0. The DFS returns the current height? and if the height becomes k-1 and the current node is not the root (pre !=0) then we reset the height to 0 and increment the answer (meaning we cut the edge above this node?).\n\n   We'll translate this to C.\n\n2. Second program (codeforces_678_B):\n\n        It reads an integer y.\n        Then it checks if y is a leap year (using check_leap).\n        Then it starts from y+1 and counts the total days (mod 7) until it finds a year that has the same leap status and the same day of the week (mod 7 of total days is 0, meaning same starting day?).\n\n        We can simulate without looping too many years? Because the cycle is 28 years? But worst-case we might loop 400 years? We can do it.\n\n3. Third program (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n\n        It reads a string S.\n        Then it computes the number of substrings that represent numbers divisible by 2019? Actually, it uses a DP-like approach with mod_arr and mod_cnt.\n\n        Specifically:\n            mod_arr[i] = ( (digit at position i from the end) * (10^i) + mod_arr[i-1] ) % 2019   [if i>0]\n            Actually, it does:\n                for i from 0 to n-1 (where i is from the end of the string):\n                    tmp = (S[N-1-i] - '0') * (radix) % 2019\n                    if i != 0: tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n                    mod_arr[i] = tmp\n                    mod_cnt[tmp]++\n\n            Then it adds mod_cnt[0] (because mod_arr[0] might be 0) and then for each mod value, it does combinations of indices with the same mod value.\n\n        Actually, the answer is the sum over i of (mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1))/2.\n\n        Why? Because if two indices i and j (i<j) have the same mod value, then the substring from i+1 to j is divisible by 2019.\n\n        We'll translate this to C.\n\nPlan for the entire C program:\n\n    Step 1: Read the input for the first program: two integers n, k, and then n integers (each integer we subtract by 1).\n\n    Step 2: Run the first program's logic (using the input) and store the result (an integer) in a variable, say result1.\n\n    Step 3: Use result1 as the input for the second program. So we set y = result1, then run the second program's logic to compute the next year that has the same starting day and leap status. The result is an integer, say result2.\n\n    Step 4: Convert result2 to a string (we'll use a buffer of sufficient size, e.g., 20 characters) and then run the third program on that string.\n\n    Step 5: The third program outputs a long integer (which we then print as the final output).\n\nBut note: the first program's output is printed by the first program and then read by the second. The second program then prints one integer. The third program then prints a long.\n\nHowever, the entire chain must be in a single C program without intermediate I/O. So we'll just pass the values as variables.\n\nWe'll structure the C program:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdbool.h>\n    #include <math.h>\n    #include <limits.h>\n\n    // Function prototypes\n    int first_program(int n, int k, int* as); // as is an array of n integers (each integer is the parent index, but note: we subtract 1 in the reading, but we have already subtracted in the input reading? Actually, we subtract in the Java code, so we do the same in the input reading in C for the first program)\n\n    int second_program(int y);\n    long third_program(char* S);\n\n    int main() {\n        // Step 1: Read input for the first program\n        int n, k;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n        int* as = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &as[i]);\n            as[i]--; // subtract one, as in the Java code\n        }\n\n        // Step 2: Run first program\n        int result1 = first_program(n, k, as);\n        free(as); // free the array as we don't need it anymore\n\n        // Step 3: Run second program on result1\n        int result2 = second_program(result1);\n\n        // Step 4: Convert result2 to a string\n        char buffer[20]; // enough for a year (up to 10 digits, but 20 is safe)\n        snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%d\", result2);\n\n        // Step 5: Run third program on the string\n        long result3 = third_program(buffer);\n\n        // Step 6: Output the final result (result3)\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", result3);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    Now we implement each function:\n\n    For first_program:\n\n        We need to build the tree (adjacency list). We have n nodes. The graph is built as:\n            lists: an array of linked lists? Or we can use a 2D array? But we don't know the maximum degree.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            int* children = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // not directly, we need an array of arrays.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            int* next = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // next sibling in the list for a node\n            int* head = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // head of the children list for each node\n            int* to = (int*)malloc((n-1) * sizeof(int)); // we have n-1 edges? Actually, we have n nodes and each node has a parent, except the root? But the root (node0) has a parent? Actually, the input gives a parent for node0? But the code for node0: if the parent j (as[0]) is positive, then we do answer++.\n\n        How the Java code builds the graph:\n\n            lists = new ArrayList of n empty ArrayLists.\n            for i from 0 to n-1:\n                j = as[i]   (the parent of node i)\n                if i > 0:\n                    then add i to the list of j (so j is the parent of i)\n                else (i==0) and if j>0 then answer++.\n\n        Actually, the root is node0. The parent of node0 is as[0]. The condition: if i==0 and j>0, then we increment the answer by 1. This is because the parent of the root should be -1 (or 0-indexed: if the parent of the root is node0 itself? then j = as[0] = 0? Then we don't increment. But if j>0, then the parent of the root is set to a non-root node? Then we must fix it? Actually, the problem: the capital is node1? But the input says the parent of node1 is ...? The problem says: the input is a sequence a1, a2, ..., an. a1 is the parent of node1? But the code uses 0-indexed: node0 is the first node.\n\n        We'll build the graph:\n\n            We'll create an array of linked lists for children. We can use:\n\n                int* children = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // we don't know the degree, so we do:\n\n            Instead, we can use:\n\n                int* degree = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                    int j = as[i]; // parent of node i\n                    degree[j]++;\n                }\n\n            Then we can create an array of arrays:\n\n                int** children = (int**)malloc(n * sizeof(int*));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    children[i] = (int*)malloc(degree[i] * sizeof(int));\n                }\n\n                // and then we need to fill them. We can use a counter array for each node.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a linked list with next pointers? But we can also use:\n\n                int* next_child = (int*)malloc((n) * sizeof(int)); // for each edge, next child in the list for the parent\n                int* head = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) head[i] = -1;\n\n                Then we add each child to the parent's list.\n\n            However, the DFS in the Java code iterates over the list of children. We can do:\n\n                We'll create:\n\n                    int* first_child = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // first child of node i, or -1 if none\n                    int* next_sibling = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // next sibling of node i, or -1 if none\n\n                How to build:\n\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        first_child[i] = -1;\n                    }\n\n                    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                        int parent = as[i];\n                        next_sibling[i] = first_child[parent];\n                        first_child[parent] = i;\n                    }\n\n            Then we can traverse the children of a node by:\n\n                for (int child = first_child[node]; child != -1; child = next_sibling[child]) { ... }\n\n        Steps for first_program:\n\n            int answer = 0;\n            // For the root (node0): if as[0] > 0 then answer++? But note: as[0] is the parent index (which we subtracted 1). In the input, the parent of node0 was originally given as x, then we subtracted 1. So if the original parent was 1 (so as[0] = 0) then we don't increment. If the original parent was 2 (so as[0] = 1) then we increment.\n\n            Actually, the Java code: \n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    j = as.get(i);   // which is the input minus one\n                    if (0 < i) {\n                        lists.get(j).add(i);\n                    } else if (0 < j) {\n                        answer++;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            So in C:\n\n                if (i==0 && j>0) then answer++.\n\n            But note: as[0] is the parent of node0. So j = as[0]. So:\n\n                if (as[0] > 0) then answer++;\n\n            Then we build the graph for nodes 1 to n-1.\n\n            Then we do DFS starting at node0. The DFS function:\n\n                int dfs(int a, int pre, int** children, int* next_sibling, int k, int* answer) {\n                    int h = 0;\n                    for (int child = children[a]; child != -1; child = next_sibling[child]) {\n                        int nh = dfs(child, a, children, next_sibling, k, answer);\n                        if (nh > h) h = nh;\n                    }\n                    if (pre != 0 && h == k-1) {\n                        (*answer)++;\n                        return 0;\n                    } else {\n                        return h+1;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            However, note: the DFS in Java returns the height and increments the answer in the middle. But the DFS in the Java code does:\n\n                for each child i in the list for a:\n                    h = max(h, dfs(i, a))\n\n                then:\n                    if (pre !=0 and h == k-1) then set h=0 and answer++.\n                    else h++\n\n                return h.\n\n            We'll do the same.\n\n        But note: the DFS uses recursion. The tree can be deep? The problem says n can be up to 10^5? Then recursion might cause stack overflow. We must use iterative DFS? Or set the stack size? But the problem says to behave identically. The Java code uses a thread with a large stack. In C, we can use iterative DFS to avoid deep recursion.\n\n        We'll implement iterative DFS with a stack.\n\n        How iterative DFS for this?\n\n            We need to compute for each node the maximum height from its children? Actually, the DFS returns the height of the node.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We'll have an array to store the height for each node, and an array to store the maximum height from the children? Actually, we compute the height for a node after all its children.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Use a stack that stores (node, parent, current index in the children list)\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    We traverse in postorder.\n\n                We can use:\n\n                    int* stack = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                    int* parent_stack = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // we don't need parent_stack? We know the parent from the tree? Actually, we need the parent for the condition.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    We'll have an array: \n                        int* height = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                    We'll also have an array for the next pointer in the DFS (the next child to visit for a node).\n\n                Algorithm:\n\n                    int* next_child_ptr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // current next child index? Actually, we are using linked list representation.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        next_child_ptr[i] = first_child[i]; // the next child to visit for node i\n\n                    Then:\n\n                        stack[top] = node0; \n                        parent_stack[top] = -1; // the parent of the root is -1 (so that we don't do the condition for the root)\n\n                    But the condition in DFS: if (pre != 0) -> meaning if the parent is not the root? Actually, the root has parent 0? No, in the DFS call for the root: pre is 0? Actually, the root is called with pre=0.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Initialize an array for the next pointer (next_child_ptr) to be the first child of each node.\n\n                    Push the root (node0) to the stack.\n\n                    We also need an array to store the current height for each node? Actually, we compute the height of a node after we have computed all its children.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        We'll have an array h_arr of n, initially 0.\n\n                    Algorithm:\n\n                        while stack not empty:\n                            node = stack top.\n\n                            if we haven't visited the children of this node, then we push the next unvisited child? Actually, we do a DFS that is iterative and we want to simulate the recursion.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                            We'll use a stack that stores the node and the parent? Actually, we can store:\n\n                                struct State {\n                                    int node;\n                                    int parent;\n                                    int current_child_index; // but we don't have index, we have linked list: we can store the current child pointer?\n                                }\n\n                            Actually, we can traverse the children by:\n\n                                if the current node has a next child (from next_child_ptr[node]) then:\n                                    child = next_child_ptr[node];\n                                    then set next_child_ptr[node] = next_sibling[child];\n                                    then push the current node again? and then push the child.\n\n                            But we want to compute the height of the children first.\n\n                        Steps:\n\n                            We'll have a stack (array) of nodes. We also have:\n\n                                int* next_ptr = ... // for each node, the next child to visit (or the current state: we are going to visit the next child)\n\n                            We traverse in postorder: we push a node and then we push all its children? Actually, we push the node and then we push the first child? Then we continue until we hit a leaf.\n\n                        We can do:\n\n                            Initialize an array for the current child pointer for each node: \n                                current_child[i] = first_child[i]\n\n                            We also have an array for the height of each node, initially 0.\n\n                            We also have a stack.\n\n                            Push node0.\n\n                            while stack not empty:\n                                node = stack top.\n\n                                if current_child[node] is -1 (meaning we have processed all children), then we pop it and compute the height for this node.\n\n                                else:\n                                    child = current_child[node];\n                                    current_child[node] = next_sibling[child]; // advance to the next sibling for next time\n                                    push child.\n\n                            Then after we pop the node, we:\n\n                                max_height = 0;\n                                for (all children of node) we know the height? Actually, we don't store the children's height? We can store an array h_arr for each node.\n\n                                But in the iterative DFS, we don't have the children's height stored? Actually, we compute the height of a node after all its children are popped.\n\n                                So we do:\n\n                                    when we pop a node, we have already computed the heights of all its children? Then we can compute the maximum height of the children.\n\n                                However, how do we get the maximum? We can maintain an array for the maximum height among the children we've seen so far? Or we can update the height of the node as we process the children? Actually, we can update the height of the node when we pop the child? But we don't have the parent's state.\n\n                            Alternatively, we can store for each node the maximum height from its children? But we can do:\n\n                                We traverse the children and update the max height for the node.\n\n                            Actually, we can do:\n\n                                We maintain an array h_arr for the height of each node.\n\n                                Then when we pop a node, we:\n\n                                    max_child_height = 0;\n                                    for each child in the adjacency list? But we are using linked list. We can traverse the children? But we don't have the list stored? We have the linked list for the children, but we have the current_child array? Actually, we can precompute the children? Or we can store the children's heights in an array? Or we can update the parent when the child is popped.\n\n                            How about we don't use the linked list for DFS? Instead, we build an array of children lists (with arrays) and then for each node, we can iterate over all children? Then we don't need to worry about the order.\n\n                        We'll do:\n\n                            Precompute the children as a list of arrays? Actually, we can build an array for each node: the list of children? But that requires dynamic arrays. We can do:\n\n                                int** children = (int**)malloc(n * sizeof(int*));\n                                int* child_count = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n\n                            Then we can also precompute the children arrays:\n\n                                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                                    int parent = as[i];\n                                    children[parent][child_count[parent]++] = i;\n                                }\n\n                            Then we can do iterative DFS:\n\n                                We have a stack of nodes.\n\n                                We push node0.\n\n                                We maintain an array for the current child index (the next child to visit) for each node.\n\n                                We also maintain h_arr for the height of each node.\n\n                                Algorithm:\n\n                                    current_index = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int)); // current child index for each node\n\n                                    stack[top] = node0; top++;\n\n                                    while (top > 0) {\n                                        node = stack[top-1];\n                                        if (current_index[node] < child_count[node]) {\n                                            // push the next child\n                                            int child = children[node][current_index[node]];\n                                            current_index[node]++;\n                                            stack[top] = child;\n                                            top++;\n                                        } else {\n                                            // pop the node\n                                            top--;\n                                            // compute the max height of children\n                                            int maxh = 0;\n                                            for (int i = 0; i < child_count[node]; i++) {\n                                                int child = children[node][i];\n                                                if (h_arr[child] > maxh) maxh = h_arr[child];\n                                            }\n                                            // Now, if node is not the root (node0) and maxh == k-1, then we reset the height and increment the answer?\n                                            // But note: the condition in the Java code: \n                                            //   if (pre != 0 && h == k-1) then ... \n                                            // Here, we don't have the parent? Actually, we know the parent: the parent of node is as[node]? But wait: the parent of a node is stored in the original as array? Actually, we built the children from as, but we don't store the parent? We can store the parent for each node? \n\n                                            Actually, we need the parent to check if it is the root? The root is node0. So if node==0, then parent doesn't matter? Actually, the condition: if (pre != 0) -> meaning if the node is not the root? So for the root, we don't do the condition.\n\n                                            How to get the parent? We can build a parent array? Actually, we have as: as[i] is the parent of node i? But note: for node0, as[0] is the parent? But we built the children for each node from as. And we know that the parent of node i (for i>=1) is as[i]. But what about node0? We don't have a parent for node0? Actually, in the DFS call for node0, the parent is passed as 0? Actually, the root is called with pre=0.\n\n                                            So we can do:\n\n                                                For node0, we skip the condition? We can store an array parent[i] for each node? Actually, we have as: \n                                                    parent[0] = as[0]   // but note: the root (node0) has parent as[0] (which we subtracted 1) so we have the parent index in as[0]. But in the DFS, the parent of the root is passed as 0? Actually, the Java code calls dfs(0,0). The second argument is 0.\n\n                                            We can store the parent of each node? Actually, we can build:\n\n                                                parent[0] = -1; // because the root has no parent? But the Java code passes 0 as the parent for the root.\n\n                                            Actually, the Java code: \n                                                dfs(0,0) -> so the root's parent is 0? But 0 is the root? So we have a special meaning: the root's parent is 0? Then in the condition: if (pre != 0) -> for the root, pre=0, so skip.\n\n                                            How to store the parent for each node? We can build an array:\n\n                                                int* parent_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                                                parent_arr[0] = 0; // because the root is called with parent=0?\n                                                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                                                    parent_arr[i] = as[i]; // but note: as[i] is the parent index (which is the index in the 0-indexed array) of node i?\n                                                }\n\n                                            Actually, the parent of node i is as[i]. So we can do:\n\n                                                if (node != 0) { // because the root has parent_arr[0]=0? Actually, the root has parent_arr[0] = as[0] (which is the input). We don't have a parent for the root? \n\n                                            Actually, the condition in the Java code: \n                                                if (0 < pre && h == k-1) \n\n                                            So we check: if the parent is not 0? Then for the root, we skip.\n\n                                            How about we store for each node the parent? Actually, we can set:\n\n                                                parent_arr[0] = 0;   // because in the DFS call, pre=0.\n\n                                            Then for any node, we can check: if parent_arr[node] != 0? But note: the parent of a non-root node might be 0? For example, a direct child of the root has parent 0 (the root). Then we do the condition? Yes.\n\n                                            So:\n\n                                                if (node != 0) { // because the root has parent_arr[0]=0, but we skip the root anyway? Actually, we are processing the root at the end. We want to do:\n\n                                                    if (parent_arr[node] != 0) { ... } \n\n                                                But wait: the condition is on the parent of the current node? Actually, the condition in the DFS: \n                                                    if (0 < pre && h == k-1) \n\n                                                Here, pre is the parent of the current node. In our iterative DFS, we have the parent_arr[node] (which is the parent index). We want to know: is parent_arr[node] != 0? \n\n                                                But note: the root's parent is set to 0. For any other node, parent_arr[node] is the index of the parent. The condition is: if the parent is not the root? Actually, the condition checks: if the parent is not 0? But 0 is the root? So:\n\n                                                    if (parent_arr[node] != 0 && maxh == k-1) {\n                                                        // then we reset the height to 0 and increment the answer\n                                                        h_arr[node] = 0;\n                                                        answer++;\n                                                    } else {\n                                                        h_arr[node] = maxh + 1;\n                                                    }\n\n                                            However, wait: in the Java code, the condition is inside the DFS after the for-loop. And it uses the variable 'pre' (the parent) and the variable 'h' (the max height from the children). Then:\n\n                                                if (pre != 0 and h == k-1) then set h=0 and answer++.\n                                                else h++\n\n                                            So in our iterative DFS, we do:\n\n                                                if (node != 0 && maxh == k-1) {\n                                                    h_arr[node] = 0;\n                                                    answer++;\n                                                } else {\n                                                    h_arr[node] = maxh + 1;\n                                                }\n\n                                            But note: the condition checks the parent, but we are checking the parent of the current node? Actually, the condition is: if the parent of the current node is not 0? Yes, because the root has parent 0 (so skip). And for a non-root node, if the maxh from its children is k-1, then we cut the edge above the current node? and set the height to 0? and then the parent will see a height of 0 for this node.\n\n            However, the Java code does:\n\n                h = 0;\n                for (child in children) \n                    h = max(h, dfs(child))\n\n                then:\n                    if (pre !=0 and h==k-1): \n                        h = 0; \n                        answer++;\n                    else: \n                        h = h+1\n\n                return h.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                maxh = max(children's returned h)\n\n                then if (pre !=0 and maxh == k-1): \n                    return 0 and increment answer.\n                else: \n                    return maxh+1\n\n            In our iterative DFS, we compute for the current node:\n\n                maxh = max(children's h_arr[child])\n\n                then if (node !=0 and maxh == k-1): \n                    h_arr[node] = 0;\n                    answer++;\n                else:\n                    h_arr[node] = maxh + 1;\n\n            But note: what if k==1? Then k-1=0, so if maxh==0, then we reset? But then we increment the answer? \n\n            Example: k=1: then we reset and set h_arr[node]=0. Then the parent (if not root) will see 0? \n\n            But k=1: we are cutting the edge above the node if the node has a parent that is not the root? \n\n            However, the root's children: if the root has a child with maxh=0 (which means a leaf) and k-1=0, then we reset? But the root has parent 0, so we don't reset? So the root's child will return 0+1=1? \n\n            This is complex. We'll stick to the iterative DFS with storing the children in arrays.\n\n        Steps for first_program:\n\n            int answer = (as[0] > 0) ? 1 : 0;   // because for node0, if j>0 (j=as[0]) then answer++.\n\n            Build the parent array for nodes: \n                int* parent_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    parent_arr[i] = (i==0) ? 0 : as[i]; // for node0, we set parent_arr[0]=0? But the Java code passes 0 as the parent of the root. Actually, we will use: the root's parent is 0 (a dummy value that is not a valid node index? but 0 is the root's index). We want to check: if the parent is not 0? But the root's parent is 0, so we skip the root. For a child of the root, parent_arr[child] = 0 (the root's index). Then condition: if (parent_arr[child] != 0) -> false? But the Java code: the root's child has pre=0? Then condition: 0<pre -> false? So we skip. So we can do:\n\n                    condition: if (parent_arr[node] != 0 && ...) -> but note: the parent_arr[0] is 0, and for a child of the root, parent_arr[child]=0. So we want to skip the root and also skip any node whose parent is the root? Actually, the condition in the Java code: \n                        if (0 < pre) \n                    So pre must be >0? In the parent_arr, the root is 0, so we skip any node that has parent 0? So we can do:\n\n                        if (parent_arr[node] != 0)   // because parent_arr[node] is the parent index? But the parent index of a child of the root is 0? Then we skip.\n\n                    Actually, we want to skip the root and also skip nodes that have the root as parent? But the condition in the Java code: \n                        if (0 < pre) \n                    So pre must be greater than 0? In the parent_arr, the parent index is the index of the parent node. The root is node0. So if the parent is node0, then pre=0? Then we skip. For a node whose parent is node1 (index1), then pre=1? Then we do the condition.\n\n                    So we can do:\n\n                        if (parent_arr[node] != 0)   // because parent_arr[node] is the index of the parent. The root is 0. So if the parent is not the root (node0) then we do the condition.\n\n            Build the children arrays:\n\n                int* child_count = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                    int par = as[i]; // parent of node i\n                    child_count[par]++;\n                }\n\n                int** children = (int**)malloc(n * sizeof(int*));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    children[i] = (int*)malloc(child_count[i] * sizeof(int));\n                }\n\n                int* idx = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                    int par = as[i];\n                    children[par][idx[par]++] = i;\n                }\n                free(idx);\n\n            Then we do iterative DFS:\n\n                int* stack = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n                int* current_index = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int)); // current child index for each node\n                int* h_arr = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int)); // height for each node\n\n                int top = 0;\n                stack[top++] = 0; // root\n\n                while (top > 0) {\n                    int node = stack[top-1];\n                    if (current_index[node] < child_count[node]) {\n                        int child = children[node][current_index[node]];\n                        current_index[node]++;\n                        stack[top++] = child;\n                    } else {\n                        top--; // pop\n\n                        // Compute maxh from children\n                        int maxh = 0;\n                        for (int i = 0; i < child_count[node]; i++) {\n                            int child = children[node][i];\n                            if (h_arr[child] > maxh) maxh = h_arr[child];\n                        }\n\n                        // Now, if the node is not the root and the parent is not the root? Actually, condition: if the parent of the node is not the root (node0) and maxh == k-1?\n                        // But note: the condition in the Java code: if (0 < pre) -> pre is the parent index? and we stored parent_arr[node] (the parent index). We want: if (parent_arr[node] != 0) because 0 means the root.\n                        if (parent_arr[node] != 0 && maxh == k-1) {\n                            // Then we cut: set the height of this node to 0 and increment the answer.\n                            h_arr[node] = 0;\n                            answer++;\n                        } else {\n                            h_arr[node] = maxh + 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then free all allocated memory for the DFS.\n\n            Return answer.\n\n        But note: the condition in the Java code: \n            if (0 < pre && h == k-1) \n        Here, h is the maxh from the children. And then we set h=0 and increment the answer. Otherwise, we set h = h+1.\n\n        We are doing the same.\n\n        However, what if k==0? Then k-1 = -1, and maxh (>=0) will never be -1. So it's safe.\n\n    For second_program:\n\n        We are given an integer y.\n\n        We need to compute the next year that starts on the same day of the week and has the same leap status.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            bool leap = check_leap(y);\n            int total = 0;\n            int year = y+1;\n            while (1) {\n                total += (check_leap(year)) ? 366 : 365;\n                total %= 7;\n                if (total == 0) {\n                    bool leap2 = check_leap(year);\n                    if (leap == leap2) {\n                        return year;\n                    }\n                }\n                year++;\n            }\n\n        But note: total can be modulo 7. We can use:\n\n            int total = 0;\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i-1)) { \n                    // Actually, the total days from year y to year i-1? \n                    // But we are counting from y+1 to i: \n                    //   We start at year y+1, then we add the days of year y+1, then y+2, ... until i.\n                    // So we are adding the days of each year starting from y+1.\n\n                }\n\n        However, the Java code:\n\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i)) {\n                    sum += 366;\n                } else {\n                    sum += 365;\n                }\n                if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                    if (check_leap(i) == leap) {\n                        return i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        We'll do the same.\n\n        Note: we must avoid overflow? The year might be large? But the cycle is 400 years? So we can break after at most 400 years? Actually, the Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years? But we are only adding modulo 7. We can do modulo 7:\n\n            sum %= 7;   // to keep sum small.\n\n        We'll implement:\n\n            bool check_leap(int y) {\n                return (y % 400 == 0) || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n            }\n\n    For third_program:\n\n        We are given a string S (which is the string representation of the year, but it might be large? The year is an integer, so it's at most 10 digits? But the program is designed for any string of digits).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            int n = strlen(S);\n            int* mod_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            int mod_cnt[2019] = {0}; // initialize to 0\n            int radix = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                // we traverse from the last character to the first? Actually, the Java code: \n                //   for i from 0 to n-1: \n                //        char at N-1-i\n                int digit = S[n-1-i] - '0';\n                int tmp = digit * radix % 2019;\n                if (i != 0) {\n                    tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n                }\n                mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n                mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n                radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n            }\n\n            long ans = 0;\n            mod_cnt[0]++;   // because the Java code does: mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop? Actually, it does mod_cnt[0]++ at the end.\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n                long cnt = mod_cnt[i];\n                ans += cnt * (cnt - 1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            free(mod_arr);\n            return ans;\n\n        But note: the Java code does:\n\n            mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n            mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n            and then after the loop: mod_cnt[0]++;\n\n            Then it computes the combinations.\n\n        However, why mod_cnt[0]++? The comment says: because the substring from the entire string? Actually, the method counts the pairs (i, j) such that the substring from 0 to j is divisible by 2019? \n\n        Actually, the combination formula: \n            ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2\n\n        This counts the pairs of indices (i, j) with i<j such that mod_arr[i] = mod_arr[j]. But also, if mod_arr[i]=0, then the substring from 0 to i is divisible by 2019? So we need to count the single ones? \n\n        The Java code does: mod_cnt[0]++ -> so it adds one to the count of 0. This is because the empty substring? Or the entire substring? Actually, the method: \n\n            mod_arr[0] = last digit * 1 mod 2019.\n            mod_arr[1] = last two digits: (last digit * 10 + second last) mod 2019? Actually, the radix for the last digit is 1, then 10, then 100, etc.\n\n        But the formula: \n            The number of pairs (i, j) (i<=j) such that the substring from i to j is divisible by 2019 is the same as the number of pairs (i, j) (i<j) such that the suffix from 0 to i-1 and from 0 to j have the same mod? Actually, the difference: (suffix j - suffix i) * 10^(?) mod 2019 =0.\n\n        The standard method: \n            We compute the suffix mods? Actually, the mod_arr[i] is the mod of the suffix starting at position n-1-i to the end? \n\n        Actually, the Java code:\n\n            mod_arr[i] = (digit at n-1-i) * (10^i) + ...? \n\n        It is the mod of the substring from n-1-i to the end? \n\n        But then the combination formula counts the number of pairs of suffixes that are the same mod? And that gives the number of substrings that are divisible by 2019? \n\n        And adding mod_cnt[0]++ is because the entire string (if mod=0) is also counted? Actually, the empty suffix? \n\n        The Java code does: mod_cnt[0]++ -> so it adds one to the count of 0. This is for the empty prefix? \n\n        Actually, the standard solution for this problem (ABC164_D) uses:\n\n            Let F(i) = the number formed by S[i..n-1] mod 2019.\n            Then we want to count pairs (i, j) (i<j) such that F(i) = F(j) mod 2019? \n            But note: F(i) = (S[i] * 10^(n-i-1) + ... + S[n-1]) mod 2019.\n\n            Then the substring from i to j-1: \n                F(i) - F(j) * 10^(j-i) mod 2019 = 0.\n\n            But if we have F(i) = F(j) mod 2019, then the substring from i to j-1 is (F(i) - F(j)*10^(j-i)) / (10^(j-i)) mod? -> not exactly.\n\n        Actually, a common solution is to use:\n\n            Let P[0] = 0\n            P[i] = (S[0..i-1]) mod 2019.\n\n            Then the substring from i to j is (P[j] - P[i]*10^(j-i)) mod 2019.\n\n            But we can do:\n\n                We traverse from the end: \n                    Let F(i) = the suffix starting at i mod 2019.\n\n            The solution in the Java code is from the end.\n\n        But we'll just translate the Java code as is.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            mod_cnt[0]++;   // as in the Java code.\n\n        Then compute the combinations.\n\n    Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n    Note: we must be cautious about memory and performance.\n\n    We'll assume n (for the first program) is up to 100000.\n\n    We'll compile with -O2.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Due to the complexity, we'll write the C code accordingly.\n\n    We'll use:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n    We'll write the functions:\n\n        int first_program(int n, int k, int* as) {\n            // ... \n        }\n\n        bool check_leap(int y) {\n            return (y % 400 == 0) || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n        }\n\n        int second_program(int y) {\n            // ...\n        }\n\n        long third_program(char* S) {\n            // ...\n        }\n\n    Then main as above.\n\n    Due to the length, we'll write the entire code in one file.\n\n    Let's code accordingly."
