The idea is to take the largest elements but skip every other one starting from the second largest.\n\nSo, in C, I need to replicate this. Let's start step by step.\n\nIn Java, they use Scanner to read input. In C, I'll use scanf. The array is of size 3n. So first, read n, then create an array of 3n integers. Then read each element using a loop.\n\nNext, sort the array. In Java, Arrays.sort(array) sorts in ascending order. In C, the standard library's qsort function can be used, but I need to provide a comparison function. Since the Java sort is ascending, the C qsort should also sort in ascending order.\n\nAfter sorting, the Java code takes elements from the end. The head is initialized to array.length - 2, which is 3n-1-2 = 3n-3? Wait, array is length 3n. So array.length is 3n. So head starts at (3n -1) -1? Wait, in the code, array is 3n elements.

For example, if n=1, array is 3 elements. After sorting, say [1,2,3]. Then head starts at 3-2=1. So array[1] is 2. Then in the loop, for i=0, add 2 to res. Then head becomes -1. So that's for n=1, sum 2. Wait, but the problem statement says that the correct approach is to pick the second largest, fourth largest, etc. Hmm, maybe the logic is that after sorting in ascending order, the largest elements are at the end.

For n steps.\n\nLet me see an example. Suppose n=1, array has 3 elements. After sorting, [a, b, c] where a<=b<=c. The code takes array[1], which is b. So sum is b. But according to the problem statement (AGC012 A), the correct answer is to sum the second largest elements each time. For example, when you have 3n elements, you select the second, fourth, etc., largest elements. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem statement is for the AGC012 A problem. The approach here is that when you have 3n elements, after sorting them in ascending order, you take the elements at positions n, n+2, ..., 3n-2 (if I'm not mistaken). Or perhaps the code's logic is to sort the array, then pick the second, fourth, etc., largest elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal array sorted in ascending order. So the largest is at index 3n-1. Second largest is 3n-2. Then third is 3n-3, etc. Wait, no. If sorted in ascending order, the elements go from smallest to largest. So the largest element is the last element, index 3n-1. The second largest is 3n-2. Third is 3n-3, and so on.\n\nSo the Java code's head starts at 3n-2. Then subtracts 2 each step. So for n steps, the elements added are 3n-2, 3n-4, 3n-6, etc. So for n=1, it's 3*1-2 =1 (the second largest, which is correct for the problem's example? Let me check.\n\nThe problem's example might be: For example, when n=2, and the array is sorted, then the code picks the elements at positions 3n-2 =4, then 2, etc. Wait, let's see. Suppose n=2, 3n=6 elements. Sorted array is [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], sorted ascending. The largest is a5, then a4, a3, a2, a1, a0.\n\nWait, no, sorted in ascending order, a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a5. So the largest is a5. The code's head is 6-2=4 (a4). Then next head is 2 (a2), and so on. So for n=2, two elements: a4 and a2. Sum those. So the sum is a4 + a2.\n\nBut according to the problem's logic, maybe we need to take the second, fourth largest.

The compare function for qsort should sort in ascending order. Because in Java, Arrays.sort sorts in ascending order. So the C qsort with the compare function a - b will sort in ascending order. So that's correct.\n\nThen, head starts at size-2, which is 3n-2, same as the Java code. Then subtract 2 each time. The sum is accumulated in a long variable in Java, which is 64-bit. In C, use long long for res to prevent overflow. Because if the elements are up to 1e9, and n is 1e5, then sum is up to 1e14, which fits in a long long.\n\nYes.

So sum 9 +5 =14. Which is the sample output. So the code should output 14. And the C code would do that.\n\nSo the translation should be correct."
