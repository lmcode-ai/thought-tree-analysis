Alternatively, we can use dynamic allocation, but for simplicity, since n is up to... well, the problem doesn't specify, but in programming contests, this approach is acceptable. Testing the code: for example, when n=3 and count=5, the max is (2)^2 +1^2=5. So output YES, and the grid would have L in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), but count is 5.

Another case: n=2. a=1.5 becomes 1 (since integer division), wait wait in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is even. For example, n=2: (2+1)/2 is 1.5, but since it's integer division in Java, it becomes 1. Similarly, in C, (n+1)/2 for integer n. So for even n, a is (n+1)/2. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 -> 2. Wait, no: in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is even. Let's confirm. Wait Java uses integer division. So for n=3, (3+1)/2=2. So a=2, b=1. Then max=4 +1=5. In C, integer division is the same as in Java. So when n is even, (n+1)/2 would be (even +1)/2. For example, n=4: 5/2=2 (integer division). Then a=2, b=4/2=2. So max is 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2=8. Which is correct. So the code in C for a and b is correctly calculated. So the translated code should work as intended.",
