So inside the inner loop (the j loop), once the score is >= G, we set a flag and break the j loop, then check the flag and break the i loop. Or, use a goto to jump out of both loops. Yes, using a goto here might be the simplest way. So in the C code, when the score >= G during the addition of problems from an unselected category, we can break out of the loops using a goto. So, the code structure would be:\n\nfor (bit from 0 to (1 << D) -1) {\n   calculate score and solve_num for selected categories (bit set) if (score < G) {\n       for (i from D-1 downto 0) {\n           if category i not selected in bitmask {\n               add some problems from this category (up to p[i]-1)\n               for each j from 0 to p[i]-2 {\n                   add 100*(i+1) to score, increment solve_num\n                   if (score >= G) {\n                       goto done_adding;\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n       done_adding:\n   }\n   if score >= G, check min.\n} So the 'done_adding' label is placed right after the loop where we add the problems.

So in C, the 'done_adding' label is placed after the code that adds the extra problems. Then, regardless of whether we broke early or not, we check if the score is >= G and update the min. But in the C code, after the label, the code checks if (score >= G) and updates min. But in Java, the code is:\n\nif (score >= G) {\n    min = Math.min(...);\n} So yes, in C, after the done_adding label, we have the same check. Wait, but in the C code, after adding the extra problems, the code jumps to done_adding. So whether the score was sufficient before adding (like if bitmask's score was already >= G), or after adding some problems, the code proceeds to check. Yes. So the structure is correct. Another point: the 'score' variable in Java is an int. But 100*(i+1)*p[i] could be large. For example, if D is 10, i+1 is 10, p[i] could be up to 1e5, then 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, and with multiple such terms, the sum could be up to 1e8. But in Java, int is 32-bit, so up to 2e9. So maybe in C, we need to use a 64-bit integer for score. But in Java, they use an int. Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the code uses 'int' for 'score', but the maximum possible score could be higher. For example, if D is 10, and each p[i] is 100, then each term is 100*(i+1)*100 + c[i]. For i=9, 100*10*100 = 100000, and for 10 such terms, 1e6, but in Java, the int can hold up to 2^31-1 (about 2e9). So if D is 10, and all bits are set, sum could be up to 10 * (100*10*1e5 + 1e5) = 1e8 + 1e6 = 101000000, which is within int.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's look at the Java code first. The main logic is about solving a problem where you select some problems to reach a certain score with the minimum number of problems solved. The approach uses bitmasking to try all combinations of problem sets.\n\nFirst, I'll start by including necessary headers in C. The Java code uses Scanner for input, so in C, I'll use scanf. The variables D and G are integers. Wait, G is a long in Java, but in C, since G can be up to 1e10 or something, maybe use a long long for G. So I'll declare variables accordingly.\n\nThe Java code has two arrays p and c. In C, I'll have to read those using loops. Then, the main part is the bitmask loop. In Java, they loop from bit 0 to (1 << D) - 1. In C, that's the same. The bitmask represents which problems are fully solved (all problems in a category). \n\nFor each bitmask, they calculate the score and solve_num. Then, if the score is less than G, they look for the highest category not included in the bitmask and add as many problems as needed to reach G, up to p[i]-1 (since using all would trigger the bonus, which is already handled in the bitmask part if the category was selected).\n\nIn C, handling the bits is similar. The loop over i from D-1 down to 0 to find the highest possible category. Then, iterate up to p[i]-1 times for adding each problem's score.\n\nNow, translating variables: the min variable is initialized to INF (100000 in Java). In C, I'll use an int for min, initializing to a large value.\n\nOne thing to note is that in Java, the 'break loop;' uses a labeled break. In C, labeled breaks aren't available. So, I'll have to use a flag or a goto to exit the loop when the score is met. Let's see. The code in Java has a label 'loop' on the outer for loop, and when the score is sufficient, it breaks the loop. So in C, perhaps use a goto statement to jump out of the loop once the score is met.\n\nWait, the Java code does:\n\nloop:\nfor (int i = D-1; ...) {\n   if ((bit & (1<<i)) == 0) {\n      for (int j=0; j < p[i]-1; j++) {\n          add score and solve_num\n          if (score >= G) break loop;\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nSo, when the score meets G, it breaks out of the entire loop. In C, to replicate that, since we can't break multiple loops with a single break, we can use a goto.\n\nSo inside the inner loop (the j loop), once the score is >= G, we set a flag and break the j loop, then check the flag and break the i loop. Or, use a goto to jump out of both loops.\n\nYes, using a goto here might be the simplest way. So in the C code, when the score >= G during the addition of problems from an unselected category, we can break out of the loops using a goto.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nfor (bit from 0 to (1 << D) -1) {\n   calculate score and solve_num for selected categories (bit set)\n   if (score < G) {\n       for (i from D-1 downto 0) {\n           if category i not selected in bitmask {\n               add some problems from this category (up to p[i]-1)\n               for each j from 0 to p[i]-2 {\n                   add 100*(i+1) to score, increment solve_num\n                   if (score >= G) {\n                       goto done_adding;\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n       done_adding:\n   }\n   if score >= G, check min.\n}\n\nSo the 'done_adding' label is placed right after the loop where we add the problems. So in C, inside the 'if (score < G)' block, after the for loops over i and j, we can have a label 'done_adding' and use a goto to jump there once the score is met.\n\nAnother thing: the variables in Java are int for p and c. In C, since p and c can be up to 1e5? Well, assuming the problem constraints are the same, but in the code, the Java code uses int arrays. So in C, we can use int arrays for p and c as well.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read D and G. G is a long in Java, so in C, use long long.\n\n2. Read D pairs of p[i] and c[i].\n\n3. Iterate over all bitmasks from 0 to (1 << D) -1.\n\n4. For each bitmask, calculate the score and solve_num.\n\n5. If score is insufficient, add some problems from the highest available unselected category.\n\n6. Check if the total score is >= G, and update min.\n\nNow, in C, when using bitmask variables, since D can be up to 10 (as per typical ABC problem constraints), 1 << D is manageable (up to 1024 iterations). So no problem with that.\n\nPossible edge cases: when the bitmask selects no categories, then all problems have to be added from the highest category possible.\n\nImplementing the loop:\n\nIn the bitmask loop:\n\nInitialize score to 0 and solve_num to 0.\n\nThen, for each i (0 to D-1), check if the bit is set. If yes, add 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i] to score, and add p[i] to solve_num.\n\nThen, if score is still less than G, proceed to add problems from unselected categories.\n\nIn C, the variables are:\n\nint D;\nlong long G;\nint p[10], c[10]; // assuming D is up to 10.\n\nNow, the code outline in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <limits.h>\n\n#define INF 100000\n\nint main() {\n    int D;\n    long long G;\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &D, &G);\n    int p[10], c[10];\n    for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &p[i], &c[i]);\n    }\n    int min = INF;\n    for (int bit = 0; bit < (1 << D); bit++) {\n        long long score = 0;\n        int solve_num = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n            if (bit & (1 << i)) {\n                score += 100 * (i + 1) * p[i] + c[i];\n                solve_num += p[i];\n            }\n        }\n        if (score < G) {\n            for (int i = D - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                if (!(bit & (1 << i))) {\n                    int max_add = p[i] - 1;\n                    for (int j = 0; j < max_add; j++) {\n                        score += 100 * (i + 1);\n                        solve_num++;\n                        if (score >= G) {\n                            goto done_adding;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        done_adding:\n        if (score >= G) {\n            if (solve_num < min) {\n                min = solve_num;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", min);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, after the 'loop' break, the code checks if score >= G again. So in C, the 'done_adding' label is placed after the code that adds the extra problems. Then, regardless of whether we broke early or not, we check if the score is >= G and update the min.\n\nBut in the C code, after the label, the code checks if (score >= G) and updates min.\n\nBut in Java, the code is:\n\nif (score >= G) {\n    min = Math.min(...);\n}\n\nSo yes, in C, after the done_adding label, we have the same check.\n\nWait, but in the C code, after adding the extra problems, the code jumps to done_adding. So whether the score was sufficient before adding (like if bitmask's score was already >= G), or after adding some problems, the code proceeds to check.\n\nYes. So the structure is correct.\n\nAnother point: the 'score' variable in Java is an int. But 100*(i+1)*p[i] could be large. For example, if D is 10, i+1 is 10, p[i] could be up to 1e5, then 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, and with multiple such terms, the sum could be up to 1e8. But in Java, int is 32-bit, so up to 2e9. So maybe in C, we need to use a 64-bit integer for score. But in Java, they use an int. Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the code uses 'int' for 'score', but the maximum possible score could be higher. For example, if D is 10, and each p[i] is 100, then each term is 100*(i+1)*100 + c[i]. For i=9, 100*10*100 = 100000, and for 10 such terms, 1e6, but in Java, the int can hold up to 2^31-1 (about 2e9). So if D is 10, and all bits are set, sum could be up to 10 * (100*10*1e5 + 1e5) = 1e8 + 1e6 = 101000000, which is within int. Wait, but in the original code, the Java code uses 'int' for 'score' and 'G' is a long. But in the code, comparing score (int) to G (long) could be a problem if score overflows. Wait, but in Java, when you compare an int to a long, the int is promoted to long. So if the sum is up to 1e8, which is within int's capacity (since 2e9 is the max), so it's okay.\n\nBut in C, if we use 'int' for score, then with D=10 and p[i]=1e5, 100*10*1e5 = 1e7 per term. 10 terms would be 1e8. Which is still within int (as int is 32-bit, up to 2e9). Wait, no, 1e8 is 100,000,000, which is well within 2e9. So maybe in C, 'score' can be an int. Wait, but in the original Java code, 'score' is an int. But in the code, G is a long. However, in the code, when adding, for example, 100*(i+1) * (p[i] - 1), that could be up to 100*10*1e5 = 1e7 per category. So for D=10, that's 1e8. So if 'score' is an int, which is 32-bit, it can handle up to 2e9. So perhaps in C, using 'int' for score is okay.\n\nWait, but the problem says that G can be up to 1e10. Wait, in Java, the code uses a long for G, which is 64 bits. So in C, if 'score' is an int, which is 32 bits, then when G is 1e10, comparing the score (which can only be up to 2e9) would result in score being less than G. But that's not correct. Wait, this is a problem. Oh wait, in Java, the code uses 'int' for score. So if the required G is 1e10, the code would have a problem because even if all the selected categories' scores sum to 1e8, but G is 1e10, then the code would attempt to add more problems from other categories, but in Java, when 'score' is an int, adding up could overflow, leading to negative values and incorrect comparisons.\n\nBut the original Java code is as written. So perhaps there's a mistake in the Java code. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the constraints are such that G can be up to 1e9, which would fit in an int. But in the Java code, 'G' is a long, which suggests that it can be up to 1e18. However, in the code, 'score' is an int. So there's a possible overflow here, leading to incorrect results. But the user provided that Java code, and we have to translate it to C as is, even if there's a bug.\n\nBut in the problem statement, perhaps the intended solution is that the sum can be up to 1e10, which would require a 64-bit integer. Therefore, in the C code, we need to use 'long long' for 'score' and 'G' variables. Because in the Java code, 'G' is a long (64-bit), and the code compares 'score' (int, 32-bit) to G. But if G is larger than 2e9, then even if the code's 'score' overflows, the comparison would be incorrect. So the Java code is wrong, but we have to translate it as is.\n\nWait, but the code may have a bug here. But the user wants the code translated, not fixed. So in the C code, we need to replicate the Java code's behavior. But in Java, when you compare an int and a long, the int is promoted to long. So in C, we should use a 64-bit integer for 'score' to avoid overflow, even if the Java code uses an int. Because otherwise, if the sum exceeds 2e9, the C code's 'score' will overflow, leading to incorrect results. But the Java code would have the same problem. So perhaps the original Java code is incorrect, but the user expects us to translate it faithfully.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's constraints are such that G is small enough to fit into an int, but the original code uses a long for G. So in the C code, to avoid overflow, we should use 'long long' for 'score' and 'G'. So the variables in C would be:\n\nlong long score = 0;\nint solve_num = 0;\n\nThen, during the adding steps, all calculations are done as long long.\n\nThis is important. For example, if D is 10, each p[i] is 1e5, and each c[i] is 1e5. Then, the total for a bitmask where all bits are set would be sum(100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]) for i=0 to D-1. For i=9, 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, and sum over 10 categories would be up to 1e8. But if D is larger, say 20, but according to the problem's original code, D is input as per the user's code. But in the Java code, 'D' is read as an int, and the code uses 1 << D, which for D=20 would be 1 million iterations, which is manageable but 'D' might not be that big. But in any case, in the C code, 'score' should be a long long to avoid overflow, even if the Java code uses an int. Because in C, if the variables are 32-bit, and the sum is larger than 2e9, it will overflow and cause incorrect calculations.\n\nBut the original Java code uses 'int' for 'score', which can cause overflow. However, the problem may have constraints that prevent that. But since the user's code uses 'int' for 'score', but 'G' is a 'long', perhaps it's a mistake. However, the translation should be accurate. So in the C code, 'score' should be a 'long long' to match the Java code's possible 32-bit 'int' but when 'score' is added with 100*(i+1)*p[i], which could be large. Wait, Java's 'int' is 32 bits, so 100*(i+1)*p[i] can be up to 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, multiplied by up to 10 categories (if D=10), that's 1e8, which is under 2e9 (Java's int can handle up to 2,147,483,647). So it's okay. But if D is 20, and p[i] is 1e5, then 100*20*1e5 = 2e7 per category, multiplied by 20 categories is 4e8, which is also under 2e9. So 'score' can fit in a 32-bit signed integer. So in C, using a 32-bit 'int' for 'score' is acceptable. But in the case where the sum exceeds 2e9, the code would have an overflow. But according to the problem's constraints, maybe it's intended. So for the sake of translation, we can use 'long long' for 'score' and 'G' to avoid any overflow issues, even if the original Java code uses 'int' for 'score'. Because in C, using 'int' for 'score' when G is a 'long long' could lead to errors when G is larger than 2e9.\n\nWait, for example, if G is 3e9, but 'score' is a 32-bit int, which can't hold 3e9. So when the code adds to 'score', it overflows and becomes negative. Then, when comparing to G (3e9), 'score' would be considered less than G, and the code would try to add more problems. But that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, to prevent this, in the C code, 'score' should be a 'long long' to handle large values of G. So even though the Java code uses 'int', which is 32 bits, in C, to correctly handle G up to 1e18, we need 'score' to be 64 bits. Otherwise, the code would have incorrect behavior for large G values. So the correct translation would be to make 'score' a 'long long' in C.\n\nTherefore, in the C code:\n\nlong long score = 0;\n\nYes. So, in the C code, 'score' is a long long. So that part is different from the Java code. But since Java's code uses 'G' as a long, the comparison in Java will promote 'score' to a long, but if 'score' has overflowed (e.g., became negative), it would compare as less than G, leading to incorrect behavior. So in the C code, to avoid this, we should use 'long long' for 'score'.\n\nTherefore, the correct translation requires 'score' to be a long long. So in the C code:\n\nInside the loop over bit:\n\nlong long score = 0;\nint solve_num = 0;\n\nThen, when adding to score, the variables are handled as 64-bit.\n\nSo the code in C would use long long for score.\n\nTherefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct, except that 'score' is declared as long long, and compared to G, which is also a long long.\n\nYes. So the code I wrote earlier is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, when adding problems from the highest category not selected, it checks if (bit & (1 << i)) == 0. In C, the bitwise operators are similar. So in C, that's correct.\n\nTesting the code: For example, the sample input from the problem (if any). But since I don't have the problem statement, I'll assume that the code's logic is correct as per the Java version.\n\nSo, the final C code would be as follows."
