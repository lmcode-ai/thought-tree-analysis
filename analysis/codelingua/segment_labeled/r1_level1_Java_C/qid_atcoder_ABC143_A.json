      "text": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's look at the Java code first. The program reads two integers from the input, calculates a value c as a minus 2 times b. If c is negative, set it to zero, then print it. So in C, I need to replicate this logic. Let's think about how to read the input. In Java, they're using BufferedReader to read a line and split into strings. In C, I can use scanf to read two integers directly. That's simpler. First, include the necessary headers. For input/output, I'll need stdio.h. Also, since we might be using functions like printf and scanf. The main function in C is int main(void) or int main(int argc, char** argv). Since the Java code doesn't use command line arguments, we can use int main(). Then, declare variables a, b, c. All integers. So int a, b, c;. Read the input. Using scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);. That should get the two integers from standard input. Need to make sure that the input is correctly parsed. Assuming that the input is properly formatted, as in the Java code. Compute c = a - 2*b. Then check if c is less than zero. If so, set to zero. So in C code: c = a - 2 * b;\nif (c < 0) {\n    c = 0;\n}\n\nThen print the result with printf(\"%d\\n\", c);. Putting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, c;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b); c = a - 2 * b;\n    if (c < 0) {\n        c = 0;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n} Wait, the Java code catches exceptions, but in C there's no try-catch. So we can ignore the exception handling part.",
