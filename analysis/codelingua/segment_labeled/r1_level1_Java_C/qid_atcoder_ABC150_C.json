Then set new_remaining[2] to '\\0'. So the new_remaining becomes \"ac\". Yes, that works. Testing this function: for remaining = \"23\", ans = \"1\".

Then recursively call with ans \"12\", remaining \"3\". Since remaining is length 1, add \"123\" to perms. Then i=1 in the call with remaining \"23\": new_ans \"13\", remaining \"2\". Add \"132\".

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part of the code is generating permutations of a number sequence and then finding the positions of two input strings in those permutations to calculate the absolute difference between their indices. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads two lines of numbers (each line has n numbers concatenated into a string). It generates all permutations of the numbers 1 to n in lexicographical order. Then it finds the positions of the two input strings in this list of permutations and computes the absolute difference between their indices.\n\nSo, translating this to C. Let's think about how to handle permutations. In Java, the permutation function is recursive, generating all possible permutations of a string and adding them to a list. In C, we don't have ArrayList, so we'll need to manage memory manually. But generating permutations for n elements can be up to 8! =40320, which is manageable with a fixed-size array if n is small. Since the problem constraints probably allow n up to 8 or 10, a static array can be used.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the permutation is generated for the string \"123...n\", which is numbers in order. So the permutations are generated in lexicographical order? Wait, no. The way the Java code generates permutations is by fixing each character as the first character and recursively permuting the rest. This would generate permutations in lexicographical order only if the initial string is sorted. Since the initial number is \"123...n\", which is sorted, the permutations are generated in lex order. So the list of permutations is ordered lex, so each permutation's index corresponds to its position in the lex order.\n\nIn C, generating all permutations in lex order can be done using the standard permutation generation methods, perhaps using the next_permutation function from the C standard library. Wait, but C doesn't have a built-in next_permutation function. Oh, but maybe we can implement it. Alternatively, generate all permutations recursively and store them in lex order.\n\nAlternatively, since the original code's permutation function generates all possible permutations and the order depends on the recursive approach, perhaps the order is the same as the standard lex order. Let me check.\n\nIn the Java permutation function, for each position i in the target string, it takes the i-th character, appends it to ans, and then permutes the remaining characters. Since it starts from i=0 to the end, and for each step, the next character is selected in order, this approach generates permutations in lex order. For example, for \"123\", the first level of recursion picks '1', then '2', then '3' for the first character. Then recursively, the remaining characters are permuted. So yes, the order of the generated permutations is lexicographical.\n\nSo in C, we need to generate all permutations of the numbers 1..n as strings, in lex order, collect them into a list, then find the indices of the two input strings, and compute the absolute difference.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Read the next two lines, each consisting of n numbers, and concatenate each into a string. Let's call them s1 and s2.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the numbers 1 to n in lex order, stored as strings (e.g., \"123\", \"132\", etc.), in the same way as the Java code.\n\n4. Find the indices of s1 and s2 in this list of permutations.\n\n5. Compute the absolute difference between the two indices and print it.\n\nNow, the main challenge is generating the permutations in lex order and storing them. In C, we can generate all possible permutations using a recursive approach similar to the Java code, and collect them into an array.\n\nBut how to handle dynamic arrays in C? Since the maximum possible permutations is n! which for n=8 is 40320, which is manageable with a static array. So perhaps precompute the maximum possible size (like 40320 for n=8) and use a static array.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic memory allocation. But for simplicity, let's assume that n is up to 8, so 40320 is manageable.\n\nSo first, let's code the permutation function.\n\nIn Java, the permutation function takes a list, target string, and ans. It appends ans + target when target's length is 1. Otherwise, for each character in target, take that character, append to ans, and permute the remaining characters.\n\nIn C, we can write a similar recursive function. Let's represent the permutations as an array of strings (char arrays). But how to store them? Since each permutation is a string of length n, each element is a char*.\n\nBut handling dynamic strings in C can be a bit tricky. So perhaps we can create a global array of pointers to char, and during the permutation generation, allocate each string and add to this array.\n\nAlternatively, compute the number of permutations in advance (n!), preallocate the array, and then fill it.\n\nSo let's outline the code:\n\n- Global variables: an array of char pointers (permutations), and an index to track how many have been added.\n\nBut in C, global variables are okay for this purpose.\n\nSo:\n\nchar *perms[40320]; // assuming n is up to 8, 8! is 40320\n\nint perm_count = 0;\n\nThen, a recursive function to generate permutations. The function will build the permutations by choosing each character in turn and appending to the ans, then permuting the remaining.\n\nBut since in C, strings are handled as char arrays, we need to manage memory for the permutations.\n\nWait, the original Java code builds the permutation by appending characters to 'ans' and the 'target' is the remaining characters. So for example, when the target is \"23\", ans is \"1\", then we pick '2' and '3' in turn.\n\nSo in C, the permutation function would take the current ans, the remaining characters (as a string), and then generate permutations.\n\nBut how to pass these parameters. Let's think of a function:\n\nvoid generate_permutations(char *ans, char *remaining, char **perms, int *perm_count) {\n    if (strlen(remaining) == 0) {\n        // add ans to perms\n        perms[*perm_count] = strdup(ans);\n        (*perm_count)++;\n        return;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(remaining); i++) {\n        // take remaining[i], add to ans, and permute the rest\n        char new_ans[100]; // assuming n is small\n        strcpy(new_ans, ans);\n        char c = remaining[i];\n        strncat(new_ans, &c, 1);\n\n        // create new_remaining: remaining without the i-th character\n        char new_remaining[100];\n        strcpy(new_remaining, remaining);\n        memmove(new_remaining + i, new_remaining + i + 1, strlen(new_remaining) - i);\n\n        generate_permutations(new_ans, new_remaining, perms, perm_count);\n    }\n}\n\nBut this approach has a problem with the new_ans and new_remaining being local arrays. Since in recursion, each call may modify the same stack space, but since each recursive call is made with the new copies, this should be okay.\n\nWait, but in C, the parameters passed are copied, so each recursive call has its own new_ans and new_remaining. So this should work.\n\nBut the initial call would be to generate_permutations with ans as an empty string, and remaining as the initial sorted string (like \"1234...\").\n\nWait, the initial sorted string in the Java code is \"123...n\", created by:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    number += i;\n}\n\nSo for n=3, number is \"123\".\n\nSo in C, we need to generate this initial string. For example, for n=3, create a string \"123\".\n\nSo, the code for building the initial string would be:\n\nchar initial[10];\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    initial[i] = '1' + i;\n}\ninitial[n] = '\\0';\n\nWait, if n is 3, then '1' + 0 is 49 (ASCII for '1'), then '1' +1 is '2', etc. So this works for i starting from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. For i from 0 to n-1, '1' + i gives '1', '2', ..., '0' + (n-1 +1) ?\n\nWait, the original code for number is:\n\nfor (i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n    number += i;\n}\n\nSo for n=3, numbers are 1,2,3. So the string is \"123\".\n\nSo in C, initial is built as:\n\nchar initial[10]; // assuming n <=9, so 10 is enough.\n\nint pos =0;\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n    initial[pos++] = '0' + i; // because i is 1 to n, so '1', '2', etc.\n}\ninitial[pos] = '\\0';\n\nWait, wait. Wait, '0' + i when i is 1 would be '1'. So yes. So for i from 1 to n, add '0' + i to the initial string. So for n=3, initial is \"123\".\n\nOnce the initial string is built, call generate_permutations with ans as empty string, remaining as initial.\n\nThen, the generate_permutations function will build all permutations and add them to the perms array.\n\nOnce all permutations are generated, we need to find the indices of the two input strings s1 and s2 in this array.\n\nBut how to read the input lines. The Java code reads each line as n numbers, concatenated. For example, if the input line is \"2 1 3\", it becomes \"213\".\n\nIn C, for each of the two lines, read n integers, and concatenate them into a string.\n\nSo, for each line:\n\nchar line[2][10]; // assuming n is small.\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2; i++) {\n    char temp[10] = {0};\n    for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n        int num;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n        temp[j] = '0' + num; // assuming the numbers are single digits.\n    }\n    strcpy(line[i], temp);\n}\n\nWait, but what if the numbers are not single digits? For example, n=10, but the input numbers are 1-10. Then the code would not work. But in the original Java code, the input is read as individual strings (using scanner.next()) and concatenated. So the input lines are sequences of numbers, but the code treats them as separate elements, which are then concatenated. So for example, if the input is \"1 10 2\", the code would concatenate as \"1102\". But that's problematic because the permutation is of numbers 1 to n (n=3 here, but the permutation would be \"1210...\" which is impossible. Wait, the original code's 'number' variable is created by concatenating 1 to n. So for n=3, the permutations are of the digits '1','2','3' in some order. But the input lines may have numbers beyond single digits, but the code would read them as strings and concatenate. For example, if the input line is \"1 10 2\", the code would read each token as \"1\", \"10\", \"2\", and concatenate them into \"1102\". But the permutations are of the digits \"1\",\"2\",\"3\", so such a case would not match any permutation and return 0 as the sum. But according to the problem statement, probably the inputs are permutations of the numbers 1..n, each as a single digit. Because in the original code, the 'number' variable is built by 1 to n as digits. So the input lines are sequences of 1 to n in some order, each as a single-digit number. So in the problem, n can be up to 8, and the input numbers are each 1..n as single digits.\n\nSo in the C code, we can read each number as an integer, then convert to a character by adding '0', and build the string.\n\nSo, for example, for each line of input:\n\nRead n integers. For each integer, check if it's between 1 and n. Then, convert to a character (since the permutations are of the digits 1..n as characters).\n\nSo the code for reading the two input lines:\n\nchar s1[10] = {0};\nchar s2[10] = {0};\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n        int num;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n        if (i == 0) {\n            s1[j] = '0' + num;\n        } else {\n            s2[j] = '0' + num;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen, s1 and s2 are the two input strings, each of length n.\n\nOnce the permutations are generated, we need to find the indices of s1 and s2 in the perms array. Then compute the absolute difference.\n\nSo, in C, for each of the two strings, loop through the perms array until a match is found, and record the index.\n\nFor example:\n\nint index1 = -1, index2 = -1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < perm_count; i++) {\n    if (strcmp(perms[i], s1) == 0) {\n        index1 = i;\n    }\n    if (strcmp(perms[i], s2) == 0) {\n        index2 = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, if both are found, compute abs(index1 - index2).\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n- Generate the permutations.\n\nBut generating permutations recursively in C can be a bit slow for larger n, but the problem probably expects this approach.\n\nAnother approach is to use the standard algorithm for generating permutations in lex order, such as the next permutation method. But implementing that may be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, generate all permutations in lex order via the recursive approach.\n\nBut the original Java code's recursive approach generates permutations in lex order. So the C code's recursive function should do the same.\n\nNow, the code for the permutation generation:\n\nWe need to handle the permutations in the same way as the Java code. Let's outline the generate_permutations function.\n\nBut how to handle the ans and remaining parameters. For each step, the ans is the accumulated characters, and remaining is the characters left to permute.\n\nIn C, each recursive call creates a new ans and a new remaining string.\n\nSo the function would look like this:\n\nvoid generate_permutations(char **perms, int *perm_count, const char *ans, const char *remaining) {\n    if (strlen(remaining) == 0) {\n        perms[*perm_count] = strdup(ans);\n        (*perm_count)++;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(remaining); i++) {\n        // Create new_ans: ans + remaining[i]\n        char new_ans[100]; // assuming n is small, e.g., 10.\n        strcpy(new_ans, ans);\n        strncat(new_ans, &remaining[i], 1);\n\n        // Create new_remaining: remaining without the i-th character\n        char new_remaining[100];\n        strcpy(new_remaining, remaining);\n        // remove the i-th character: shift the rest left by one\n        for (int j = i; j < strlen(new_remaining) - 1; j++) {\n            new_remaining[j] = new_remaining[j+1];\n        }\n        new_remaining[strlen(new_remaining) - 1] = '\\0';\n\n        generate_permutations(perms, perm_count, new_ans, new_remaining);\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, when we create new_remaining, the initial strcpy copies the entire remaining string. Then, for removing the i-th character, we shift the characters after i to the left by one. For example, remaining is \"abc\", i=1. new_remaining is \"abc\", then after shifting, the characters from j=1 to j < 2 (since length is 3, j+1 is 2). So j=1: new_remaining[1] = new_remaining[2]. Then set new_remaining[2] to '\\0'. So the new_remaining becomes \"ac\".\n\nYes, that works.\n\nTesting this function: for remaining = \"23\", ans = \"1\".\n\nFirst iteration i=0: new_ans is \"12\", new_remaining is \"3\".\n\nThen recursive call, which appends \"3\" to new_ans, making \"123\", and adds to perms.\n\nThen i=1 for remaining \"23\": new_ans is \"13\", new_remaining is \"2\".\n\nSo the function should generate permutations correctly.\n\nNow, the initial call is generate_permutations(perms, &perm_count, \"\", initial), where initial is \"123...n\".\n\nOnce all permutations are generated, the perms array contains all permutations in lex order.\n\nThen, the code reads the two input lines into s1 and s2, then finds their indices.\n\nBut there's a problem: in the Java code, when building the line[i][0] strings, they concatenate the input numbers. For example, if the input line is \"1 2 3\", it becomes \"123\".\n\nIn C, the code reads each number as an integer, then converts to a character by adding '0'. So for numbers 1-9, this works. For numbers >=10, this would not work. But according to the problem's constraints, the input lines are permutations of 1..n, where n is up to 8, so numbers are single digits. So this is okay.\n\nOnce the perms array is generated, the two input strings s1 and s2 are searched in the array. The first occurrence of each is noted, and their indices are subtracted.\n\nNow, the code can proceed to calculate the absolute difference.\n\nBut in the Java code, sum is initially 0. For each line (two lines), it iterates through all permutations. If a permutation matches the line's string, sum is modified: first line adds the index, second subtracts. Then Math.abs(sum) is printed.\n\nWait, the Java code's loop over line.length (which is 2), and for each line, loops through the listA. So for the first line (line[0][0]), when a match is found, sum += i. For the second line (line[1][0]), when a match is found, sum -= i. Then the absolute value is printed.\n\nSo the sum is (index of line0) - (index of line1), and the absolute value is taken.\n\nSo in C, after finding index1 and index2, the result is abs(index1 - index2).\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nint index1 = -1, index2 = -1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < perm_count; i++) {\n    if (strcmp(perms[i], s1) == 0) {\n        index1 = i;\n    }\n    if (strcmp(perms[i], s2) == 0) {\n        index2 = i;\n    }\n}\n\nint result = abs(index1 - index2);\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\nBut we need to make sure that both indices are found.\n\nNow, putting all this together in C.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nInclude necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nThen, main function:\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Read two lines of input, each n numbers, concatenate into s1 and s2\n    char s1[10] = {0};\n    char s2[10] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            int num;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n            if (i == 0) {\n                s1[j] = '0' + num;\n            } else {\n                s2[j] = '0' + num;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    s1[n] = '\\0';\n    s2[n] = '\\0';\n\n    // Generate initial string \"123...n\"\n    char initial[10];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        initial[i] = '1' + i;\n    }\n    initial[n] = '\\0';\n\n    // Generate all permutations\n    char *perms[40320]; // 8! =40320 is the max for n=8\n    int perm_count = 0;\n\n    generate_permutations(perms, &perm_count, \"\", initial);\n\n    // Find indices of s1 and s2\n    int index1 = -1, index2 = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < perm_count; i++) {\n        if (strcmp(perms[i], s1) == 0) {\n            index1 = i;\n        }\n        if (strcmp(perms[i], s2) == 0) {\n            index2 = i;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int result = abs(index1 - index2);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    // Free allocated memory\n    for (int i = 0; i < perm_count; i++) {\n        free(perms[i]);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, the generate_permutations function uses strdup to allocate memory for each permutation string. So after using them, we need to free them. Hence, the loop at the end to free each perm.\n\nNow, the generate_permutations function is as follows:\n\nvoid generate_permutations(char **perms, int *perm_count, const char *ans, const char *remaining) {\n    if (strlen(remaining) == 0) {\n        perms[*perm_count] = strdup(ans);\n        (*perm_count)++;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(remaining); i++) {\n        // Create new_ans: ans + remaining[i]\n        char new_ans[100];\n        strcpy(new_ans, ans);\n        new_ans[strlen(ans)] = remaining[i];\n        new_ans[strlen(ans)+1] = '\\0';\n\n        // Create new_remaining: remaining without the i-th character\n        char new_remaining[100];\n        strcpy(new_remaining, remaining);\n        for (int j = i; j < strlen(new_remaining) - 1; j++) {\n            new_remaining[j] = new_remaining[j+1];\n        }\n        new_remaining[strlen(new_remaining) - 1] = '\\0';\n\n        generate_permutations(perms, perm_count, new_ans, new_remaining);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but creating new_ans by strcpy and then appending the character.\n\nAlternatively, for new_ans:\n\nsnprintf(new_ans, sizeof(new_ans), \"%s%c\", ans, remaining[i]);\n\nThis would be more efficient and safer.\n\nSimilarly, for new_remaining:\n\nWe can create a string that skips the i-th character.\n\nAlternative approach for new_remaining:\n\nTake the remaining string, and create a new string that is the remaining without the i-th character.\n\nFor example, remaining is \"abcde\", i=2. The new_remaining is \"abde\".\n\nSo:\n\nchar new_remaining[100];\nint len = strlen(remaining);\nstrncpy(new_remaining, remaining, i);\nnew_remaining[i] = '\\0';\nstrncat(new_remaining, remaining + i + 1, len - i - 1);\n\nThis might be more efficient.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint len = strlen(remaining);\nstrncpy(new_remaining, remaining, i);\nnew_remaining[i] = '\\0';\nstrncat(new_remaining, remaining + i + 1, len - i - 1);\n\nThis would copy the part before i, then concatenate the part after i.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n    char new_ans[100];\n    snprintf(new_ans, sizeof(new_ans), \"%s%c\", ans, remaining[i]);\n\n    char new_remaining[100] = {0};\n    int len_remaining = strlen(remaining);\n    strncpy(new_remaining, remaining, i);\n    strncat(new_remaining, remaining + i + 1, len_remaining - i - 1);\n\n    generate_permutations(perms, perm_count, new_ans, new_remaining);\n}\n\nThis should create new_remaining correctly.\n\nSo the generate_permutations function would be:\n\nvoid generate_permutations(char **perms, int *perm_count, const char *ans, const char *remaining) {\n    if (strlen(remaining) == 0) {\n        perms[*perm_count] = strdup(ans);\n        (*perm_count)++;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    int len = strlen(remaining);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        // Create new_ans\n        char new_ans[100];\n        snprintf(new_ans, sizeof(new_ans), \"%s%c\", ans, remaining[i]);\n\n        // Create new_remaining\n        char new_remaining[100] = {0};\n        strncpy(new_remaining, remaining, i);\n        strncat(new_remaining, remaining + i + 1, len - i - 1);\n\n        generate_permutations(perms, perm_count, new_ans, new_remaining);\n    }\n}\n\nThis should handle the permutation generation correctly.\n\nNow, let's test this code.\n\nFor n=3, initial is \"123\".\n\nThe permutations should be \"123\", \"132\", \"213\", \"231\", \"312\", \"321\".\n\nWait, but in lex order, the permutations of \"123\" are generated as follows:\n\nThe first level loop i=0, 1, 2.\n\ni=0: new_ans is \"1\", remaining is \"23\".\n\nThen recursively generate permutations of \"23\" with ans \"1\".\n\nIn that recursive call, remaining is \"23\", len=2.\n\nLoop i=0: new_ans \"12\", remaining \"3\".\n\nThen recursively call with ans \"12\", remaining \"3\".\n\nSince remaining is length 1, add \"123\" to perms.\n\nThen i=1 in the call with remaining \"23\": new_ans \"13\", remaining \"2\".\n\nAdd \"132\".\n\nThen i=0 in the first call is done.\n\ni=1 in the first call: new_ans is \"2\", remaining is \"13\".\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the order of permutations should be correct.\n\nNow, in the main function, after generating permutations, the code loops through the perms array to find s1 and s2.\n\nBut in the code, after generating the permutations, when checking for s1 and s2, the code uses:\n\nif (strcmp(perms[i], s1) == 0) { ... }\n\nBut s1 and s2 are built by reading the input numbers as characters. For example, input line \"1 3 2\" becomes \"132\".\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The initial string construction for 'initial' is built as '1' + i. Wait, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    initial[i] = '1' + i;\n}\n\nWait, no. For n=3, i ranges from 0 to 2. '1' +0 is '1', '1' +1 is '2', '1'+2 is '3'. So initial becomes \"123\". Correct.\n\nBut if the code is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <=n; i++) {\n    initial[i-1] = '0' +i;\n}\n\nWhich is equivalent.\n\nBut the code currently has:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <n; i++) {\n    initial[i] = '1' +i;\n}\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nAnother possible issue: the generate_permutations function may use stack space for new_ans and new_remaining, which can overflow for large n, but given the constraints (n up to 8), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n3 2 1\n\nThe two input lines are \"123\" and \"321\".\n\nThe permutations are in order 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321. The indices are 0 and 5. The difference is 5, so output is 5.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n3\n\n2 1 3\n\n1 2 3\n\ns1 is \"213\", s2 is \"123\". Indices are 2 and 0. Difference is 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code should be written as follows."
