So modifying the C code to exit after the first valid candidate is found is correct and efficient. Therefore, the C code as written with the early exit is correct. Now, test the code. For example, if the input is:\n\n1\n5 5 10\n\nThen the output should be 5 5 10. Let's see: When cx=5, cy=5. The check function:\n\nFirst loop, since h[0]=10>0, ch=0+0+10=10.

So ch = (0 - cx) + (0 - cy) +100. Then, for the second point, the expected h is max( ch - |1 - cx| - |1 - cy| , 0). Since the given h is 0, that must equal the expected value.

The program is for solving a problem where we have to find the correct coordinates (CX, CY) and height H of a point based on given data points. \n\nSo the main steps are: read input, iterate over possible CX and CY values (from 0 to 100), and for each pair, check if it's valid by using the check function. If valid, output the coordinates and height.\n\nIn Java, they use Scanner to read input. For C, we'll use scanf. Also, the Java code uses IntStream for the loop, which in C will be a regular for loop.\n\nFirst, let's think about the data structures. The Java code has arrays x, y, h of size n. In C, we'll need to dynamically allocate these arrays after reading n. Wait, in Java, the code reads n first, then initializes the arrays. So in C, we can do the same: read n, then use malloc to allocate memory for x, y, h arrays.\n\nThen, the main loops: in Java, they loop i and j from 0 to 100 (inclusive). So in C, the same loops: for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) etc.\n\nThe check function in Java takes the arrays, n, cx, cy, and returns the height. If invalid, returns -1. So in C, the function will be similar. But in C, we have to pass pointers to the arrays, but since arrays in C are passed as pointers, we can just pass the array variables.\n\nWait, in C, when you pass an array to a function, it decays into a pointer to the first element. So the function parameters for check in C would be (int n, int* x, int* y, int* h, int cx, int cy). Then, the function proceeds similarly to the Java code.\n\nNow, let's think about the check function's logic. First, it finds the first h[i] that's greater than 0 and calculates ch as h[i] + abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy). Then, for all other points, it checks if h[i] is equal to max(ch - ... , 0). So in C, we can use the abs function (include <stdlib.h> for that), and the same logic applies.\n\nIn C, the main function will read the inputs using scanf. But we need to be careful with the dynamic allocation. For example:\n\nRead n first. Then, allocate x, y, h as int arrays of size n. Then loop n times to read each x[i], y[i], h[i].\n\nThen, loop over i and j from 0 to 100. For each (i,j), call the check function. If the returned ch is positive, print i j ch.\n\nThe check function in C will return an int. Let's outline that function:\n\nint check(int n, int* x, int* y, int* h, int cx, int cy) {\n    int ch = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (h[i] > 0) {\n            ch = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy) + h[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    // Now verify all points\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int expected = ch - abs(x[i] - cx) - abs(y[i] - cy);\n        expected = expected > 0 ? expected : 0;\n        if (h[i] != expected) {\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n    return ch;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, if all h[i] are zero except some, then the first loop would set ch based on the first h[i] >0. But if all h[i] are zero, then ch remains -1, which would cause the second loop to compare h[i] with max(-1 - ..., 0). But in the Java code, the check function first finds ch using the first h[i]>0. If all h[i] are zero, then the first loop doesn't set ch, leaving it as -1, but the problem probably ensures that there is at least one h[i]>0. But the code in Java assumes that. So in C, the same logic applies.\n\nSo the check function in C is straightforward.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nInclude necessary headers: stdio.h, stdlib.h for abs and malloc.\n\nIn main:\n\nRead n with scanf. Then allocate x, y, h arrays using malloc(n * sizeof(int)). Then read each of the n entries.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 100 (inclusive), same for j. For each i and j, call check. If the returned value is >0, then print i j ch.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the check function returns -1 if invalid, otherwise returns ch. So in C, same. So in the loops, for each i and j, call check, and if the return is positive, output the result.\n\nOnce found, perhaps break out of loops. But in Java, the code continues to check all possibilities, but according to the problem statement, there's only one correct answer. So in C, same approach: check all possible i and j, and whenever check returns a positive value, print it. But in the problem, there should be exactly one correct answer, so even if multiple are printed, the first one is correct. However, according to the problem's setup, the code would output the correct answer as soon as it's found, and in practice, the code would output it once.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint check(int n, int* x, int* y, int* h, int cx, int cy) {\n    int ch = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (h[i] > 0) {\n            ch = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy) + h[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int expected = ch - abs(x[i] - cx) - abs(y[i] - cy);\n        if (expected < 0) expected = 0;\n        if (h[i] != expected) {\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n    return ch;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int* x = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    int* y = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    int* h = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x[i], &y[i], &h[i]);\n    }\n    for (int cx = 0; cx <= 100; cx++) {\n        for (int cy = 0; cy <= 100; cy++) {\n            int ch = check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy);\n            if (ch > 0) {\n                printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", cx, cy, ch);\n                free(x);\n                free(y);\n                free(h);\n                return 0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // According to problem statement, there's always a solution, so this part may not be reached.\n    free(x);\n    free(y);\n    free(h);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, they loop through all possible cx and cy, and for each, check and print if ch is positive. But the Java code doesn't return after finding the first solution. It might print multiple solutions? But according to the problem statement, there's only one correct answer. However, the problem's code may have the correct solution printed once, and others may not. Wait, in the check function, when you find a candidate (cx, cy) that satisfies all the constraints, then return the ch. The Java code then prints it. But in the Java code, after checking all possible (cx, cy) pairs, there might be multiple candidates. But according to the problem statement, there is exactly one correct answer, so the code would find it once. However, the code as written in Java will output all valid (cx, cy, ch) pairs. But in practice, the problem's constraints should ensure that only one exists, so the code will output it once.\n\nBut in the C code, perhaps after finding the first valid candidate, we can return immediately, which would save time. The Java code may output multiple, but in reality, the correct code would only have one. So in the C code, as written, once a valid ch is found (i.e., check returns a positive value), the code prints it and exits. That's better for efficiency, but is that correct?\n\nIn the original Java code, the code loops through all possible cx and cy, and for each pair, calls check. If check returns a positive ch, it outputs it. So if there are multiple possible candidates (which should not be the case according to the problem), the code would output all. But the problem says that there is exactly one, so the code would output one line.\n\nBut in the C code, the code as written above, once a candidate is found, outputs it and returns 0. That's acceptable, but only if the first candidate found is the correct one. However, the original Java code may check cx and cy in a different order. Wait, in Java, the loops are i from 0 to 100 (cx) and j from 0 to 100 (cy). So the outer loop is cx, inner loop is cy. So for cx=0, cy varies from 0 to 100. Then cx=1, etc. The first candidate found (i.e., the first (cx, cy) in this order that satisfies the condition) is printed. Then the code continues to check other possibilities, but according to the problem, there's only one, so the code would print one line.\n\nBut in the C code, once we find the first (cx, cy) that returns a positive ch, we print and exit. That's correct as well, since the problem ensures there is exactly one solution.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the code may find multiple candidates (if any), but in reality, there's only one. So the Java code's approach is to loop all possibilities and print any valid ones, but the C code can exit early. So modifying the C code to exit after the first valid candidate is found is correct and efficient.\n\nTherefore, the C code as written with the early exit is correct.\n\nNow, test the code.\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\n1\n5 5 10\n\nThen the output should be 5 5 10. Let's see:\n\nWhen cx=5, cy=5. The check function:\n\nFirst loop, since h[0]=10>0, ch=0+0+10=10. Then for the second loop, check all points (only one here). expected = 10 -0 -0=10. h[0]=10, which matches. So returns 10. So output is 5 5 10.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2\n\nx[0]=0 0 100\n\nx[1]=1 1 0\n\nSo the correct answer is (0,0) with H=100. But for another point (1,1), the expected h is 100 - (0+0) = 100. But the given h is 0. Wait, no. Wait, the second point has h=0. So according to the check function:\n\nFor a candidate (cx, cy), the check function first finds the first h[i] >0, which is the first point. So ch = (0 - cx) + (0 - cy) +100. Then, for the second point, the expected h is max( ch - |1 - cx| - |1 - cy| , 0). Since the given h is 0, that must equal the expected value. So for (cx, cy) = (0,0), ch=0+0+100=100. Then for the second point, expected is 100 -1 -1=98. But given h is 0. So this would not match, so (0,0) is invalid. Hmm. Wait, perhaps this test case is not valid. But the problem's code would find the correct cx, cy, ch such that all h[i] are correct.\n\nBut regardless, the code should correctly handle this.\n\nIn any case, the code structure seems correct.\n\nSo the final C code will read n, allocate arrays, read the points, then loop over possible cx and cy, and check. If found, print and exit.\n\nSo that's the code."
