For each string, it finds the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If 'G' comes after 'S', it sets returnDex to -1. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between S and G positions and stores them in an array. Then it uses a HashSet to count unique differences. If returnDex is -1, output that; else output the size of the set.\n\nSo in C, I need to replicate this logic. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Java, they use Scanner. In C, I'll use scanf for integers. For the strings, each string is of length m. So I'll need to read n strings, each of m characters (plus null terminator). So declare a 2D array like char arrs[n][m+1].\n\nThen, for each string, find the indices of 'G' and 'S'. In Java, indexOf returns the first occurrence. In C, I can loop through each character of the string to find 'G' and 'S'. Or use strchr to find their positions.

Alternatively, for each element in lengths, check if it's already been seen before, and count unique ones.\n\nBut since the possible maximum difference is m (since each string is length m), maybe we can use a boolean array to track presence. For example, create an array of size m+1 (since the maximum possible difference is m-1, if S is last and G is first). Initialize all to false. Then for each length, mark the index as true. Finally, count the number of true entries.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the lengths are stored as the difference between S and G positions. So the possible values can be from 1 (if S is immediately after G) up to m-1. But if G is at position i and S at j where j > i, then the difference is j - i. So the maximum possible is m-1 (if G is at 0 and S at m-1).\n\nSo in C, create a boolean array (or an int array) of size m, initialized to 0. Then for each length in the lengths array, set the corresponding index in the boolean array to 1. Then sum all the 1s to get the count of unique elements.\n\nBut first, check if returnDex is -1. If so, output -1. Else, output the count.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m using scanf. Then read n strings. Then process each string.\n\nWait, in C, when reading strings with scanf, you need to make sure that each string is properly allocated. So for example, if n and m are up to 1000, then declare arrs as a 2D array: char arrs[1000][1001]; assuming m is up to 1000. But since the problem doesn't specify constraints, perhaps we can use dynamic allocation. But for simplicity, maybe assume maximum sizes. Alternatively, use variable-length arrays in C99.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nint n, m;\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\nchar arrs[n][m+1];\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%s\", arrs[i]);\n}\n\nThen, for each string in arrs:\n\nint lengths[n];\nint returnDex = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    char *g_pos = strchr(arrs[i], 'G');\n    char *s_pos = strchr(arrs[i], 'S');\n    if (g_pos == NULL || s_pos == NULL) {\n        // invalid input? But according to problem statement, each row has exactly one G and S?\n        // The original Java code assumes that each string has both G and S.\n        // So perhaps in the problem, each string has exactly one G and one S.\n        // So in C, if either is not found, perhaps return -1?\n        // But the original code checks if dexG > dexS. So in the problem, each string must have both.\n        // So in C, we can proceed under that assumption.\n    }\n    int dexG = g_pos - arrs[i];\n    int dexS = s_pos - arrs[i];\n    if (dexG > dexS) {\n        returnDex = -1;\n    }\n    lengths[i] = dexS - dexG;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, if any of the strings has G after S, returnDex is set to -1. So in C, after processing all strings, if any of them has dexG > dexS, then returnDex is -1. So in the loop, once returnDex is set to -1, it remains so. So the code in C should check each string and set returnDex to -1 if any of them has G after S.\n\nThen, collect the lengths. Then, if returnDex is -1, output -1. Else, count the number of unique lengths.\n\nNow, for the unique count. Since m can be up to, say, 1000, the maximum possible length is m-1. So create an array of size m, initialized to 0. Then for each length in lengths, mark the array at index length as 1. Then sum all the 1s.\n\nBut wait, the length could be up to m-1. So the array size needs to be m. For example, if m is 1000, then indexes 0 to 999. But in the problem, the length is S index - G index, which is at least 1 (since S is after G). Wait, no. If S is after G, then dexS - dexG is positive. But if G is after S, then dexS - dexG is negative, but in that case, returnDex is set to -1, and we don't process the lengths.\n\nSo in the case where returnDex is not -1, all lengths are positive. So the lengths are >= 1? Or wait, if G and S are in the same position? No, because the problem probably ensures that each has exactly one G and S. So the difference is at least 1 if S is after G. Wait, no. For example, if G is at position 2 and S at position 3, difference is 1. If G is at position 3 and S at 3, that's impossible. So in the code, the difference is S index minus G index, which is positive if S is after G. So in the case where returnDex is not -1, all lengths are positive. So the possible values are 1 to m-1.\n\nSo for the unique count, create an array of size m (since the maximum possible difference is m-1). Initialize all to 0. Then for each length in lengths, set present[length] = 1. Then count the number of 1s in present.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the lengths can be 0? No, because if S is after G, then dexS is larger than dexG, so difference is positive. So in the code, when returnDex is not -1, all lengths are positive. So in C, the present array can be of size m, but indexes 0 to m-1. So for each length, if it's 0, that's a problem. But in the code, when returnDex is not -1, all lengths are positive. So perhaps the code can proceed.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nif (returnDex == -1) {\n    printf(\"-1\\n\");\n} else {\n    int present[m];\n    // but m could be variable, so in C99, variable-length arrays are allowed.\n    // Initialize to 0.\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        present[i] = 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        present[lengths[i]] = 1;\n    }\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        if (present[i]) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n}\n\nBut wait, what if the length is larger than m-1? For example, if m is 5, and the difference is 5. But m is the length of the string. So each string has m characters. The indexes are from 0 to m-1. So the maximum possible difference is (m-1) - 0 = m-1. So the lengths can be up to m-1. So the present array of size m (indexes 0 to m-1) is sufficient.\n\nBut in C, if m is 5, present array is size 5, indexes 0-4. So for a length of 4 (m-1), it's okay.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All strings have the same difference. So output 1.\n\n- One string has G after S: output -1.\n\n- Different differences: count them.\n\nNow, code in C:\n\nFirst, include necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nThen, main function:\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    char arrs[n][m+1]; // Each string has m characters, plus null terminator.\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", arrs[i]);\n    }\n\n    int lengths[n];\n    int returnDex = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        char *g_pos = strchr(arrs[i], 'G');\n        char *s_pos = strchr(arrs[i], 'S');\n        int dexG = g_pos - arrs[i];\n        int dexS = s_pos - arrs[i];\n        if (dexG > dexS) {\n            returnDex = -1;\n        }\n        lengths[i] = dexS - dexG;\n    }\n\n    if (returnDex == -1) {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Count unique lengths.\n        int present[m]; // C99 allows variable-length arrays.\n        memset(present, 0, sizeof(present)); // Initialize to 0.\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int len = lengths[i];\n            if (len >= 0 && len < m) { // Since len is S - G, which is positive when returnDex is not -1.\n                present[len] = 1;\n            }\n        }\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n            if (present[i]) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the present array is of size m. But when m is 0, but that's impossible since m is the number of columns, which is at least 1. So the code is safe.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 5\nG..S.\nG..S.\n..S.G\n\nWait, in the third string, S is before G. So returnDex becomes -1. So output is -1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\nG..S.\nG...S\n..GS.\n\nIn this case, the differences are 3, 4, 1. So unique count is 3. So output 3.\n\nAnother test case where all differences are same: output 1.\n\nBut what if m is 1? Then each string is length 1. But then G and S can't be in the same string. So the problem probably ensures that each string has exactly one G and one S.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- strchr returns NULL if the character is not found. So in code, need to check for that. But according to the problem statement, each string has exactly one G and one S. So in practice, this code may crash if input is invalid. But the original Java code does not handle that either. So for the purpose of the problem, we can assume that each string has exactly one G and one S. So the code is safe.\n\nBut to avoid crashes, perhaps add checks. But since the original code doesn't, perhaps the problem ensures that. So proceed.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, the lengths array is filled even if returnDex is -1. But in C, the code proceeds to fill lengths, but in the case where returnDex is -1, the code skips the counting and outputs -1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
