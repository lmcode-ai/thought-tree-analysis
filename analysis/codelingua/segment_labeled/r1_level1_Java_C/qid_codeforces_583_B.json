Each time through the outer loop, s increments, and tem flips between 1 and 0. So, translating to C. Let's start by replacing the input methods. Java's Scanner isn't in C, so I'll use scanf. The main loop in Java is while (in.hasNext()), which in C can be handled by checking if scanf successfully reads an integer. But sometimes, that's tricky. Maybe read until EOF? Let's see. The Java code processes multiple test cases, each being an n followed by n integers. In C, we can loop while (scanf(\"%d\", &n) ! = EOF). Wait, but in the Java code, the loop is while (in.hasNext()), and inside it reads n. So perhaps each input is a separate test case. So in C, we can read n until EOF, then read the array a.\n\nBut wait, the Java code reads n, then n elements for a. So in C, each iteration of the while loop starts by reading n, then the next n numbers. So the outer loop in C should read n, and process each case. So in C:\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    while (scanf(\"%d\", &n) ! = EOF) {\n        // process each test case\n        int a[n];\n        int b[n];\n        // read a's elements\n        for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n            b[i] = 0;\n        }\n        // rest of the code\n        int s = -1;\n        int tem = 1;\n        int q = 0;\n        while (q != n) {\n            s++;\n            if (tem == 1) {\n                // iterate forward\n                for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] <= q && b[i] == 0) {\n                        b[i] = 1;\n                        q++;\n                    }\n                }\n                tem = 0;\n            } else {\n                // iterate backward\n                for (int i = n-1; i >=0; i--) { if (a[i] <= q && b[i] ==0) {\n                        b[i] =1;\n                        q++;\n                    }\n                }\n                tem =1;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", s);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in C, variable-length arrays (VLAs) like int a[n] when n is read at runtime are allowed in C99, but maybe not in older standards.
