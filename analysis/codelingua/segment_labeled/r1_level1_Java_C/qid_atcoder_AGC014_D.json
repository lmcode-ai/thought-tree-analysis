  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's start by understanding what the code does. The problem seems to involve determining whether a game played on a tree results in a first or second player win based on maximum matching. The Java code uses a recursive approach with a maxMatching function that traverses the tree.\n\nFirst, I need to map the Java data structures to C equivalents. The Java code uses an ArrayList of arrays for the graph, which in C can be represented as an array of linked lists or dynamic arrays. But since C doesn't have built-in dynamic arrays, I'll need to implement them using structures and functions for dynamic memory allocation.\n\nThe main steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: The number of nodes n, followed by n-1 edges. Each edge connects two nodes (adjusted to 0-based indices).\n2. Build the adjacency list for the graph.\n3. Compute the maximum matching using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach.\n4. Determine if the maximum matching covers all nodes (if 2*m == n), outputting \"Second\" or \"First\" accordingly.\n\nLet's tackle each part.\n\nIn Java, the graph is an ArrayList of ArrayLists. In C, each node's adjacency list can be a linked list or a dynamically allocated array. Since in C, handling dynamic arrays can be a bit tedious, perhaps using a struct for each node's edges would work. But for simplicity, maybe using a linked list approach. Alternatively, for each node, we can have a pointer to an array of integers (the adjacent nodes) and keep track of the size and capacity.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, each ArrayList in g is just a list of adjacent nodes. So for each node v, g[v] contains all the nodes connected to v. In C, we can represent this as an array of pointers to arrays, where each array holds the adjacent nodes, along with their count. So for example, struct Graph { int* edges; int size; int capacity; }; but perhaps a simpler approach is to have for each node, an int* array and a count. But in practice, since the tree is built once and not modified, perhaps we can precompute the size for each node's adjacency list.\n\nBut how to do that? The Java code reads all edges and adds both directions (since it's an undirected tree). So for each edge a-b, we add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nIn C, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Read n.\n- Allocate an array of pointers (g) of size n, each element is a dynamic array (int*) storing the adjacent nodes.\n- For each of the n-1 edges, read a and b, convert to 0-based, then add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nBut in C, handling dynamic arrays requires reallocating as needed. So for each node, when adding a new neighbor, we can check if the current array is full, realloc to increase size, then add the element.\n\nAlternatively, since each node's adjacency list is built once and the number of edges is known (for a tree, each node's edges are up to n-1, but in practice, for a tree, each node's adjacency list will have as many entries as its degree. So during the edge reading phase, for each edge a-b, we can append b to a's list and a to b's list, growing the arrays as needed.\n\nSo, the steps for building the adjacency list in C would be:\n\nFor each node v, the adjacency list is a dynamically allocated array of integers. Each time we add a neighbor, we need to manage the array's size. Let's create a helper function to add a neighbor to a node's list. For example:\n\nint* adjList = NULL;\nint count = 0;\nint capacity = 0;\n\nvoid addNeighbor(int v, int neighbor) {\n    if (count >= capacity) {\n        capacity = (capacity == 0) ? 4 : capacity * 2;\n        adjList = realloc(adjList, capacity * sizeof(int));\n        // Check for realloc failure, but perhaps skip error handling for simplicity.\n    }\n    adjList[count++] = neighbor;\n}\n\nBut each node's adjacency list needs its own array. So perhaps for each node in the graph, we have:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int* edges;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nAdjList* g;\n\nThen, for each node, initialize its edges. Then, when adding a neighbor, check the capacity and realloc as needed.\n\nBut managing this in C can be a bit tedious. Alternatively, since the tree is undirected and each edge is processed once, perhaps we can precompute for each node the number of edges (degree) and then allocate exactly that much space. However, this would require two passes: one to count the degrees, then another to fill the edges. But for simplicity, perhaps using dynamic arrays with realloc is manageable.\n\nSo in code:\n\nFirst, allocate an array of AdjList structures, one for each node.\n\nAdjList* g;\n\nThen, read each edge a and b, and add each to the other's adjacency list. For each edge (a, b):\n\nadd_to_adj(&g[a], b);\nadd_to_adj(&g[b], a);\n\nWhere add_to_adj is a function that appends a new neighbor to the adjacency list.\n\nThe function add_to_adj could look like:\n\nvoid add_to_adj(AdjList* list, int neighbor) {\n    if (list->size >= list->capacity) {\n        int new_capacity = list->capacity == 0 ? 4 : list->capacity * 2;\n        int* new_edges = realloc(list->edges, new_capacity * sizeof(int));\n        if (!new_edges) {\n            // handle error, but for code submission, maybe omitted\n            exit(1);\n        }\n        list->edges = new_edges;\n        list->capacity = new_capacity;\n    }\n    list->edges[list->size++] = neighbor;\n}\n\nBut in C, the code for this can be a bit lengthy. So, during the edge processing phase, each adjacency list is built.\n\nNext, the maxMatching function. The Java code is recursive. In C, recursion depth is a problem if the tree is deep (like n up to 1e5), but given that the problem is from AGC (AtCoder Grand Contest), the constraints might be manageable. However, in practice, for very large n, recursion in C could cause stack overflow. But the code here uses a recursive approach, which in Java would handle stack depth up to a certain limit. However, since the original code uses recursion, perhaps the problem expects the same approach. So in C, we have to translate the recursion.\n\nThe maxMatching function in Java returns an integer. Let's see: the function takes a node v and its parent p, and returns some value based on the children's contributions. The variables a and o accumulate parts of the result. Each child (excluding parent) is processed recursively. Then, a is sum of r/2, o is sum of r%2. Then return 2*a + min(1, o) +1.\n\nSo in C, the function would have the same logic. The parameters are int v, int p. The function loops through all the edges of v (children), skipping the parent, and for each child, calls maxMatching and accumulates a and o.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint maxMatching(int v, int p, AdjList* g) {\n    int a = 0;\n    int o = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < g[v].size; ++i) {\n        int w = g[v].edges[i];\n        if (w == p) continue;\n        int r = maxMatching(w, v, g);\n        a += r / 2;\n        o += r % 2;\n    }\n    return 2 * a + (o > 0 ? 1 : 0) + 1;\n}\n\nWait, the Java code uses Math.min(1, o), which is equivalent to 1 if o >=1, else 0. So in C, that can be written as (o >= 1) ? 1 : 0. So 2*a + (o >=1) ? 1 : 0 + 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nreturn 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n\nSo Math.min(1, o) is 1 if o >=1, else o. So if o is 0, 0; if o >=1, 1.\n\nSo in C, that's (o > 0 ? 1 : 0).\n\nSo the return statement becomes 2*a + (o > 0) + 1. Wait, because (o >0) evaluates to 1 if true, 0 otherwise. So yes, exactly.\n\nSo in C:\n\nreturn 2 * a + (o > 0) + 1;\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, the main function. The Java code reads n, builds the adjacency list, calls maxMatching starting from root 0, parent -1. Then computes m = result / 2. Then checks if 2*m == n, outputs \"Second\" else \"First\".\n\nIn C, the main steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate the adjacency list for each node. Initialize each node's edges.\n\nRead n-1 edges. Each edge is given as two integers, which are converted to 0-based by subtracting 1.\n\nFor each edge, add each node to the other's adjacency list.\n\nCall maxMatching(0, -1, g), divide by 2 to get m.\n\nIf 2*m == n, print \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nNow, the main challenge is handling the dynamic adjacency lists in C.\n\nSo, the code structure in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int* edges;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nvoid addEdge(AdjList* adj, int neighbor) {\n    if (adj->size >= adj->capacity) {\n        adj->capacity = adj->capacity == 0 ? 4 : adj->capacity * 2;\n        adj->edges = realloc(adj->edges, adj->capacity * sizeof(int));\n        // Handle realloc failure if needed\n    }\n    adj->edges[adj->size++] = neighbor;\n}\n\nint maxMatching(int v, int p, AdjList* g) {\n    int a = 0;\n    int o = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < g[v].size; i++) {\n        int w = g[v].edges[i];\n        if (w == p) continue;\n        int r = maxMatching(w, v, g);\n        a += r / 2;\n        o += r % 2;\n    }\n    return 2 * a + (o > 0) + 1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    AdjList* g = (AdjList*)calloc(n, sizeof(AdjList));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        a--; b--; // convert to 0-based\n        addEdge(&g[a], b);\n        addEdge(&g[b], a);\n    }\n    int res = maxMatching(0, -1, g);\n    int m = res / 2;\n    if (2 * m == n) {\n        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    }\n    // Free allocated memory\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        free(g[i].edges);\n    }\n    free(g);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the root is 0. Also, the maxMatching function returns a value that is divided by 2 to get m. The Java code then checks if 2*m == n.\n\nBut the code in C must correctly handle the tree structure.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- Stack overflow due to deep recursion. For example, if the tree is a linear chain of 1e5 nodes, the recursion depth would be 1e5, which is way beyond the default stack size in C. But in the problem's constraints, perhaps n is small enough. If not, we'd need to convert the recursive approach into an iterative one. However, since the original Java code uses recursion and Java has a default stack size that's smaller than C's (but can be increased), perhaps the problem expects that the recursion is manageable. For the purpose of code submission, maybe it's acceptable. But in practice, for large trees, this code would crash due to stack overflow.\n\nBut given that the problem is from AtCoder, perhaps the test cases are designed such that the recursion works. Alternatively, the problem's constraints might be small. The original code uses recursion, so the C code here would mirror that.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the adjacency lists are ArrayLists, which are in order. But in the C code, the order of edges in the adjacency list is determined by the order in which edges are added. However, since the tree is processed recursively, the order might affect the traversal but the algorithm should be correct regardless of the order. The maxMatching function processes all children except the parent, so the order of edges in the adjacency list shouldn't matter.\n\nNow, testing this code. For example, let's consider a sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n2\n1 2\n\nThe tree is two nodes connected. The maxMatching function would be called on 0 (since 0-based). The root is 0, parent -1. The adjacency list for 0 has 1. For 1, it has 0.\n\nmaxMatching(0, -1, g):\n\nIn the loop over edges of 0 (only 1). Since p is -1, w is 1. Call maxMatching(1, 0, g).\n\nIn maxMatching(1, 0, g):\n\nThe edges of 1 are [0]. But p is 0, so the loop skips. So a=0, o=0. The return value is 2*0 + (0>0 ? 1 :0) +1 = 0 +0 +1=1.\n\nSo returning to the first call, r=1. So a +=1/2 \u2192 0. o +=1%2 \u21921.\n\nThen, return 2*0 +1 (since o>0) +1 = 0 +1+1=2. m=2/2=1. Then 2*m=2 ==n \u2192 yes. So output is \"Second\".\n\nWhich matches the expected result for a tree with two nodes, which is a perfect matching. So the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when n=3. Edges are 1-2, 2-3. Let's see. Then after converting to 0-based, the edges are 0-1, 1-2.\n\nThe maxMatching function starts at 0.\n\nFor node 0, edges are 1. Call maxMatching(1, 0, g).\n\nIn node 1, edges are 0 and 2. Parent is 0, so process edge 2.\n\nmaxMatching(2, 1, g). Node 2's edges are 1. Parent is 1, so no children. So returns 0 +0 +1=1.\n\nSo in node 1's processing: a +=1/2=0, o +=1%2=1. Then, the return is 2*0 + (o>0) +1 \u2192 0+1+1=2.\n\nSo back to node 0, r=2. a +=2/2=1, o +=2%2=0. So a=1, o=0.\n\nReturn 2*1 +0 +1=3. m=3/2=1. 2*m=2, which is less than 3. So output is \"First\".\n\nWhich is correct because the tree has three nodes, which can't have a perfect matching. So the code works.\n\nNow, handling the dynamic memory in C. The code uses calloc to allocate the array of AdjList. Each AdjList's edges are initialized to NULL (since calloc zeroes the memory). The addEdge function manages the dynamic resizing.\n\nBut in C, when realloc is called, if the initial pointer is NULL, realloc behaves like malloc. So the initial call to addEdge for a node with edges set to NULL (since calloc initializes the struct's members to zero) would first resize to capacity 4, then add the first edge.\n\nAfter processing all edges, the code frees each node's edges array and then frees the g array. So memory is properly managed.\n\nAnother possible issue is integer division. In the Java code, when r is divided by 2, it's integer division. In C, using / does integer division as well, so that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work as intended."
