Then, the next t integers are the elements of the array.\n\nSo in the C code, the main function would read t from the input (as the array size), then read t numbers.\n\nWait, the main function of the Java code is structured such that the solve function is called once. But the solve function reads the first integer as the array size.\n\nSo the C code should read the array size t, then t integers. So the code I wrote above is correct.\n\nThus, the translated code should read t, then t integers, process each as per the logic.\n\nTesting this code. For example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen the code processes each element:\n\nFirst element is 1. prevWinner starts at 0.\n\ncurrent is 1, so since prevWinner is 0, set to 2.\n\nThen, check prevWinner is 2. So enter the first branch.\n\n(current -1) is 0, which is even. So print 2. prevWinner remains 2.\n\nSecond element is 2. prevWinner is 2.\n\n(current-1) is 1. 1 % 2 is 1, so odd. So print 1, prevWinner becomes 1.\n\nThird element is 3. prevWinner is 1.\n\n(current-1) is 2, even. So print 1, prevWinner remains 1.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nWhich matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 1 1 1 1 1.\n\nprevWinner starts 0.\n\nFirst 1: prevWinner becomes 2. (current-1) 0 even. print 2. prevWinner 2.\n\nSecond 1: current is 1. prevWinner is 2. (1-1)=0 even. print 2.\n\nBut wait, for the second element, current is 1. So in code:\n\nif (current ==1) and prevWinner is 2, so that part is skipped.\n\nThen, check if prevWinner is 2. So (current-1) is 0 even. So print 2, prevWinner remains 2.\n\nThird element: same as second. So output is 2.\n\nSo all outputs would be 2,2,2,2,2.\n\nAnother example: input 2 3 4.\n\nFirst 3: prevWinner 0.\n\ncurrent is 3. (3-1) = 2 even. print 2. prevWinner 2.\n\nSecond 4: (4-1) =3, which is odd. So print 1, prevWinner becomes 1.\n\nSo output 2,1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the translated code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible issues. For example, in C, when using modulo with negative numbers, but since current is at least 1 (since in Java code, arr is read as integers, but possible input is 1 as per code. So (current-1) is >=0. So modulo 2 is safe.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nThus, the translated code should be as written."
