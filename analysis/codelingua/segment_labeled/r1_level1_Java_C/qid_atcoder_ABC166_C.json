So:\n\nint N;\n\nlong long M;\n\nscanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &M); Then, allocate H as an array of N long longs:\n\nH = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\nSimilarly for ans:\n\nbool *ans = (bool*)malloc(N * sizeof(bool));\n\nBut wait, in Java, the ans array is initialized to true.

Then read N elements into H:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &H[i]);\n\n    ans[i] = true;\n\n} Then, read M pairs of temp1 and temp2. Each pair is two integers. So in the loop for M times:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) { ... }\n\nWait, but M is a long long. So if M is larger than INT_MAX, this loop will not work. But in Java, the original code uses an int i, which can't handle M larger than 2e9. So in C, the code would have the same problem. So the translation should use a loop variable of int, even if M is a long long. So the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) { ... }\n\nBut in C, if M is a long long and i is int, when M exceeds the maximum int value, the loop will have undefined behavior. But the original Java code has the same problem. So we have to proceed as such. So in C, the code would be:\n\nint temp1, temp2;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &temp1, &temp2);\n\n    // adjust to 0-based\n\n    temp1--;\n\n    temp2--;\n\n    if (H[temp1] < H[temp2]) {\n\n        ans[temp1] = false;\n\n    } else if (H[temp1] > H[temp2]) {\n\n        ans[temp2] = false;\n\n    } else {\n\n        ans[temp1] = false;\n\n        ans[temp2] = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, count the number of true elements:\n\nint ans2 = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    if (ans[i]) {\n\n        ans2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans2); Finally, free the allocated memory. But in C, the code should free H and ans arrays. But in practice, since the program ends right after, it's not strictly necessary, but for good practice, perhaps include it. So putting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    long long M;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &M);\n\n    long long *H = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\n    bool *ans = (bool*)malloc(N * sizeof(bool));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &H[i]);\n\n        ans[i] = true;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n        int a, b;\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n        a--;\n\n        b--; if (H[a] < H[b]) {\n\n            ans[a] = false;\n\n        } else if (H[a] > H[b]) {\n\n            ans[b] = false;\n\n        } else {\n\n            ans[a] = false;\n\n            ans[b] = false;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans2 = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        if (ans[i]) {\n\n            ans2++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans2);\n\n    free(H);\n\n    free(ans);\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but in the original code, temp1 and temp2 are read as integers.

So in C, perhaps we should do the same. So in C, read M as a long long, but loop with an int i. But then, if M is larger than 2e9, the loop will not work. But perhaps that's how the original code is, so the translation has to follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original code, M is supposed to be an int, but the code uses long. Maybe it's a mistake. But regardless, the translation should mimic the original code.\n\nSo first, in the Java code, the variables are:\n\nN is an int.\n\nM is a long.\n\nH is an array of longs.\n\nans is an array of booleans.\n\nIn C, we'll use:\n\nint N;\n\nlong long M;\n\nlong long *H;\n\nbool *ans; (using stdbool.h for bool type)\n\nBut wait, in C, the standard boolean type is from stdbool.h, which defines bool as _Bool, true and false as macros.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nThen, allocate H as an array of N long longs.\n\nAllocate ans as a bool array of N elements.\n\nInitialize all ans elements to true.\n\nThen, for M pairs, read temp1 and temp2 (as integers), adjust to 0-based (since the original code subtracts 1), and compare H[temp1-1] and H[temp2-1]. Then set ans accordingly.\n\nFinally, count the number of true elements in ans.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nWe'll need to include the necessary headers: stdio.h, stdbool.h, stdlib.h (for malloc and free).\n\nRead N and M using scanf. For M, since it's a long in Java, in C, perhaps use %lld as the format specifier for long long.\n\nSo:\n\nint N;\n\nlong long M;\n\nscanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &M);\n\nThen, allocate H as an array of N long longs:\n\nH = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\nSimilarly for ans:\n\nbool *ans = (bool*)malloc(N * sizeof(bool));\n\nBut wait, in Java, the ans array is initialized to true. So in C, after allocation, we have to loop through each element and set it to true.\n\nThen read N elements into H:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &H[i]);\n\n    ans[i] = true;\n\n}\n\nThen, read M pairs of temp1 and temp2. Each pair is two integers. So in the loop for M times:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) { ... }\n\nWait, but M is a long long. So if M is larger than INT_MAX, this loop will not work. But in Java, the original code uses an int i, which can't handle M larger than 2e9. So in C, the code would have the same problem. So the translation should use a loop variable of int, even if M is a long long. So the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) { ... }\n\nBut in C, if M is a long long and i is int, when M exceeds the maximum int value, the loop will have undefined behavior. But the original Java code has the same problem. So we have to proceed as such.\n\nSo in C, the code would be:\n\nint temp1, temp2;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &temp1, &temp2);\n\n    // adjust to 0-based\n\n    temp1--;\n\n    temp2--;\n\n    if (H[temp1] < H[temp2]) {\n\n        ans[temp1] = false;\n\n    } else if (H[temp1] > H[temp2]) {\n\n        ans[temp2] = false;\n\n    } else {\n\n        ans[temp1] = false;\n\n        ans[temp2] = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, count the number of true elements:\n\nint ans2 = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    if (ans[i]) {\n\n        ans2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans2);\n\nFinally, free the allocated memory.\n\nBut in C, the code should free H and ans arrays.\n\nBut in practice, since the program ends right after, it's not strictly necessary, but for good practice, perhaps include it.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    long long M;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &M);\n\n    long long *H = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\n    bool *ans = (bool*)malloc(N * sizeof(bool));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &H[i]);\n\n        ans[i] = true;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n        int a, b;\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n        a--;\n\n        b--;\n\n        if (H[a] < H[b]) {\n\n            ans[a] = false;\n\n        } else if (H[a] > H[b]) {\n\n            ans[b] = false;\n\n        } else {\n\n            ans[a] = false;\n\n            ans[b] = false;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans2 = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        if (ans[i]) {\n\n            ans2++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans2);\n\n    free(H);\n\n    free(ans);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, temp1 and temp2 are read as integers. So in C, the variables a and b are integers. Then subtracted by 1 to get zero-based indices.\n\nBut what if the input has a or b as 0? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is probably 1-based. So the code correctly subtracts 1.\n\nNow, the issue is with the loop for M. If M is a long long, then the loop variable i is int. So if M is larger than INT_MAX, the loop will loop indefinitely. But the original code has the same problem. So the translation is correct in that aspect.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, arrays are zero-based, same as in C. So the indices are handled correctly.\n\nTesting edge cases: For example, N=1, M=0: the output should be 1.\n\nAnother case: N=2, M=1, with H[0] = 1, H[1] = 2. The pair (1,2) would set ans[0] to false. So ans2 is 1.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When M is a large value. But the original code is written that way.\n\nSo the translated code should work as per the original Java code."
