  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's look at the original code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses a Scanner to read input. In C, we'll use scanf for that. The variables n, a, b will be integers. The character c can be read using a format specifier that skips whitespace, like \" %c\" to avoid any newline issues.\n\nThe Java code initializes two arrays, FfriendPerDay and MfriendPerDay, each of size 367. In C, we can declare these as static arrays of the same size. Since the days go up to 366, the size 367 is correct (indexes 0 to 366, but maybe they start from 1? The loop in Java uses j from a to b, which I think represents days starting at 1. So in C, the arrays will be size 367, indexes 0 unused, or maybe the original code uses 1-based? Let me check. The original code in Java initializes arrays of size 367, which are 0-indexed. When they iterate from a to b, those are the actual days. So for example, if a is 1, j starts at 1, up to 366. So in C, we can do the same. So the C arrays will be size 367, and the days are 1-based.\n\nNext, the main loop reads n entries. Each entry has a character (M or F), and two integers a and b. Then for each day j from a to b, increment the corresponding array. Then check if the current day's M and F counts, take the minimum of the two and see if twice that is the maximum.\n\nThe answer is computed as the maximum of the minimum between M and F counts each day, then multiplied by 2. Because in the Java code, for each day j, the code checks whether M or F is smaller, takes the smaller one, and compares to the current answer. The answer is the maximum of these minimums. Then the final output is answer * 2.\n\nSo translating that to C:\n\nWe need to read n, then loop n times. Each time, read c (as a char), a, b. Then loop from a to b inclusive, updating the M or F array. Then, for each j, compute the minimum of MfriendPerDay[j] and FfriendPerDay[j], and see if it's larger than the current answer. Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait in the original Java code:\n\nif (c == 'M') MfriendPerDay[j]++;\nelse FfriendPerDay[j]++;\nThen, after incrementing, check if M < F: if so, take M, else take F, and see if it's larger than the current answer. So for each day, after updating, it checks the current min(M, F) and updates the answer if that's larger.\n\nSo, in each iteration of j (from a to b), after incrementing the count, they check if M's count is less than F's. If yes, then the possible answer is M's count (since F's is larger). Otherwise, it's F's count. Then compare to the current answer and update.\n\nSo the answer variable holds the maximum of the minimum of M and F counts per day.\n\nSo the final answer is answer * 2, which is the maximum number of people that can be invited, which is twice the maximum of the minimum between M and F on any day.\n\nSo in C, the logic is the same. Let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nint n;\nchar c;\nint a, b;\nint FfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\nint MfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\nint answer = 0;\n\nThen read n with scanf:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nThen loop n times:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    // read c, a, b\n    scanf(\" %c %d %d\", &c, &a, &b); // note the space before %c to skip whitespace\n    // loop from a to b inclusive\n    for (int j = a; j <= b; j++) {\n        if (c == 'M') {\n            MfriendPerDay[j]++;\n        } else {\n            FfriendPerDay[j]++;\n        }\n        // compute current min\n        int current_min;\n        if (MfriendPerDay[j] < FfriendPerDay[j]) {\n            current_min = MfriendPerDay[j];\n        } else {\n            current_min = FfriendPerDay[j];\n        }\n        if (current_min > answer) {\n            answer = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen, after processing all entries, print answer * 2.\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", answer * 2);\n\nWait, but in the Java code, during each j iteration (each day between a and b), after incrementing the count, they check whether the current M and F counts for that day, take the minimum, and update the answer if needed.\n\nSo in C, the same logic applies.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The original code in Java updates the answer every time a day is processed, even if it's processed multiple times (for overlapping intervals). For example, if a person is added to day 5 in two different entries, the code would check day 5 each time and possibly update the answer. So the approach is correct because after each increment, the min is checked.\n\nSo in the C code, the same logic is followed.\n\nNow, let's handle the arrays. The days are from 1 to 366, but in the array, they are 0-based. So indexes 1 to 366 are used. So in C, the arrays should be initialized to size 367, and all elements start at 0. Since in C, static arrays are initialized to zero if declared globally, but if declared inside a function, they need to be initialized. So in C, inside main(), when declaring:\n\nint FfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\nint MfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\n\nThis initializes all elements to zero.\n\nSo putting all together, the C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char c;\n    int a, b;\n    int FfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\n    int MfriendPerDay[367] = {0};\n    int answer = 0;\n    \n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\" %c %d %d\", &c, &a, &b);\n        for (int j = a; j <= b; j++) {\n            if (c == 'M') {\n                MfriendPerDay[j]++;\n            } else {\n                FfriendPerDay[j]++;\n            }\n            int current_min;\n            if (MfriendPerDay[j] < FfriendPerDay[j]) {\n                current_min = MfriendPerDay[j];\n            } else {\n                current_min = FfriendPerDay[j];\n            }\n            if (current_min > answer) {\n                answer = current_min;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", answer * 2);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the answer is updated inside the j loop. So even if the same day is processed multiple times, the answer is checked each time. For example, if a day is processed once for M and once for F, the answer is updated each time. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: in C, when you declare arrays like FfriendPerDay[367], the valid indices are 0 to 366. So for j ranging from a to b, which can be up to 366, that's okay.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, if input is:\n\n3\nM 1 2\nF 1 1\nF 2 3\n\nThen days 1-2 for M, 1 for F, 2-3 for F.\n\nProcessing:\n\nDay 1: M becomes 1, F becomes 1. Current min is 1. Answer becomes 1.\n\nDay 2: M becomes 2, F becomes 0 (after first entry). Then when the third entry (F) processes day 2, F becomes 1. So day 2: M=2, F=1. min is 1. But after third entry, F increments to 1, so min is 1, which is same as current answer. Then when third entry's loop is day 3, F becomes 1. So min is 0 (since M is 0 there), so answer remains 1. Then the final answer is 1*2=2.\n\nWait, maybe another example. Let me see.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge case: when a day has zero M or F. Then the min is zero, which won't affect the answer.\n\nSo the code should work."
