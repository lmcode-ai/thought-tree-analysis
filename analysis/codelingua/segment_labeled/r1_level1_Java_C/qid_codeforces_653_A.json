Let's see what the original code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n from the input, then reads n integers into a list. It then processes the list by removing duplicates, sorting it, and then checks if there are three consecutive numbers in the sorted list (like x, x+1, x+2). If such a triplet exists, it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo in C, I need to replicate this logic. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In C, I'll use scanf to read n. Then read n integers. But since C doesn't have dynamic arrays by default, I'll probably need to use an array with a fixed size. But wait, the original code uses a list which can grow dynamically. So maybe in C, I can read all the numbers into an array first, then process them.\n\nBut the problem is the original code uses streams to collect distinct elements and sort them. So the steps are: after collecting all the input numbers, we need to create a new list with distinct elements, sort them, and then check for consecutive triplets.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n integers into an array.\n3. Remove duplicates and sort the array.\n4. Check if there's a triplet of consecutive numbers.\n\nSo how to handle the distinct and sorted part? Let's think.\n\nFirst, after reading all the numbers into an array, perhaps we can sort the array first. Then, we can go through the sorted array and create a new array that contains only the distinct elements. Because when sorted, duplicates are adjacent.\n\nFor example, after sorting, if there are duplicates, they will be next to each other. So we can iterate through the sorted array and copy each element to a new array only if it's different from the previous one.\n\nOnce we have the distinct sorted array, we need to check for three consecutive elements. So loop from 0 to len-3 (if the array has at least 3 elements), and check if a[i+2] == a[i+1]+1 and a[i+1] == a[i]+1. Which simplifies to a[i+2] - a[i] == 2.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2]. If they are consecutive, then a[i+1] = a[i]+1, and a[i+2] = a[i+1]+1 = a[i]+2. So a[i+2] - a[i] should be 2. So for any triplet, if the third is two more than the first, then they form a consecutive triplet.\n\nSo in the loop, for each i from 0 to len-3, check if a[i+2] - a[i] == 2. If yes, then return true.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, in C code:\n\nFirst, read n. Then allocate an array of size n, read into it.\n\nThen sort the array. Then create a new array for distinct elements. Let's say after sorting, we create a new array called distinct, and count the number of distinct elements.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal sorted array: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4.\n\nThen distinct array would be 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo after sorting, we can loop through the original array and build the distinct array.\n\nOnce we have the distinct array, check if there are any three consecutive numbers.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead n. Then read into an array. Then sort it.\n\nThen create a new array, let's say unique_a, with size up to n (since all could be unique). Then loop through the original array, and for each element, add it to unique_a only if it's different from the previous one.\n\nFor example:\n\nint unique_a[n];\nint unique_count = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (i == 0 || a[i] != a[i-1]) {\n        unique_a[unique_count++] = a[i];\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this is after sorting. Wait, the original code first sorts the array and then takes distinct elements. So the correct approach is to sort the array first, then remove duplicates.\n\nSo after sorting, the duplicates are adjacent. So the code to create unique_a would be as above.\n\nThen, once unique_count is the size of the unique array, check if any three elements are consecutive.\n\nNow, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < unique_count; i++) {\n    if (i+2 < unique_count) {\n        if (unique_a[i+2] - unique_a[i] == 2) {\n            found = 1;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the original code checks a.get(i) +1 == a.get(i+1) and a.get(i+1)+1 == a.get(i+2). So the difference between i and i+2 is 2. So checking for unique_a[i+2] - unique_a[i] == 2 is equivalent.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into array a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCreate unique array.\n\nLoop through unique array to check for consecutive triplets.\n\nNow, in C, the code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Comparison function for qsort\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    \n    // Create unique array\n    int *unique_a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    int unique_count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (i == 0 || a[i] != a[i-1]) {\n            unique_a[unique_count++] = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    int found = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < unique_count; i++) {\n        if (i + 2 < unique_count) {\n            if (unique_a[i+2] - unique_a[i] == 2) {\n                found = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(found ? \"YES\\n\" : \"NO\\n\");\n    \n    free(a);\n    free(unique_a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the distinct is done before sorting. Wait, no, the Java code does a.stream().distinct().sorted().collect(...). So first, it removes duplicates, then sorts. Wait, no. Wait, the order is distinct() first, then sorted(). So the stream operations are in the order: distinct, sorted. So the resulting list is sorted after duplicates are removed.\n\nWait, but the way the code is written: a.stream().distinct().sorted().collect(...). So distinct is applied first, then sorted. But that's not efficient. Because when you apply distinct first on an unsorted stream, it's O(n) time but requires checking all previous elements. Then sorted. However, in practice, the code would first process the stream to collect distinct elements (which would process in the order of the original list, keeping the first occurrence of each element), then sorted. But perhaps in Java, the stream's distinct() method on an unordered stream may not be the same as first sorting and then deduping. For example, if the list has elements [3, 2, 2, 3], then distinct() would give [3,2], then sorted would be [2,3].\n\nBut in the original code, the order is: distinct, then sorted. So the distinct elements are collected in the order they appear in the original list (preserving the first occurrence), then sorted. So the final list is sorted, with all duplicates removed.\n\nBut in the approach I took in C code, I first sort the array, then remove adjacent duplicates. Which is different from the original Java code. Because in the Java code, after distinct(), which removes duplicates, but the order is the order of the original list, then sorted. So the Java code's a list after processing is a sorted list of unique elements.\n\nBut in the C code, after sorting and then removing duplicates, the unique array is the same as the Java code's processed list. Because in the Java code, distinct() followed by sorted() will give the same result as sorted() followed by distinct(), but the order in which duplicates are removed may differ. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nJava code example:\n\nOriginal list: [3, 2, 2, 3]\n\nAfter distinct(): [3,2]\n\nAfter sorted(): [2,3]\n\nIn C code:\n\nSort: [2,2,3,3]\n\nRemove duplicates (adjacent), unique array becomes [2,3]\n\nWhich is the same as the Java code's final list.\n\nSo in the end, the unique array in both cases would be the same. So the C code's approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7\n3 1 2 5 4 6 6\n\nJava code would process this as:\n\nOriginal list: [3,1,2,5,4,6,6]\n\ndistinct(): [3,1,2,5,4,6]\n\nsorted(): [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\nNow check for consecutive triplets: 1,2,3 \u2192 yes. So output YES.\n\nIn the C code:\n\nAfter sorting: 1,2,3,4,5,6,6.\n\nunique array: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nCheck for any triplet. For i=0, a[i+2] is 3-1=2, so 3-1=2, so yes. So found is set.\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\ndistinct and sorted \u2192 [1,2,3,4,5]. There are triplets.\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\n1 3 4 5 \u2192 sorted [1,3,4,5], distinct. Check 3,4,5 \u2192 difference is 5-3=2, so yes.\n\nAnother test case where there are three elements but not consecutive:\n\nInput:\n5\n1 3 5 7 9 \u2192 unique array sorted, no triplet.\n\nSo code would output NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Memory allocation: in C, using variable-length arrays (VLAs) is possible but in some environments might not be allowed. So using malloc is better. In the code above, a is malloced, and unique_a is also malloced.\n\n- Check the loop for the triplet: in the code, for i in 0 to unique_count-1, and check if i+2 < unique_count. So i can be up to unique_count-3. For example, if unique_count is 3, then i can be 0. So the loop runs from i=0 to i=unique_count-1, but the condition i+2 < unique_count is checked. So it's safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work."
