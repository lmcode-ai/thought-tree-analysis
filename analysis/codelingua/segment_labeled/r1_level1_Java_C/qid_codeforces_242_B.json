For the arrays a and b, we can use malloc(n * sizeof(int)) after reading n.\n\nEdge cases: n=0? But in Java, the code reads n from input, and the for loops run 0 times. But the problem probably expects n >=1. But in the code, if n is zero, the code would proceed. However, according to the problem statement, perhaps n is at least 1. So in the C code, assuming n is >=1. Testing for n=1: if the single segment is (left, right), then output 1. Now, the loop: In Java, the code has for (int i=0; i <n; i++) for reading, and same for the checking loop. In C, same loops. For the first loop, after reading a[i] and b[i], update left and right. For the second loop, check if a[i] == left and b[i] == right. If found, print i+1 (since Java uses 0-based index, then ++i, which is i+1), then return 0. Wait, the Java code, when found, does System.out.println(++i); because inside the loop, the original i is 0-based. So for example, if i=0 (first element), then ++i becomes 1, which is the correct 1-based index. So in C, in the loop, the index is i (0-based), so when found, output i+1. So, in the checking loop, for each i from 0 to n-1: if (a[i] == left && b[i] == right) --> print i+1, then exit. Else, after all, print -1.
