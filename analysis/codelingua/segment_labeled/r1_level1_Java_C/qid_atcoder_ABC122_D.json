  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe problem seems to be about counting the number of valid strings of length N made up of the characters A, C, G, T, such that no substring \"AGC\" appears, and also checking for any swaps of adjacent characters that could form \"AGC\". The solution uses memoization with a dynamic programming approach.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the Java code. The main class is atcoder_ABC122_D. It has a few key components: the calc() method which initiates the DFS, the dfs() recursive function with memoization, and the isOK() method that checks if the last four characters (after appending a new character) form a forbidden pattern.\n\nTranslating this to C will require handling the memoization differently since C doesn't have built-in maps or objects. Also, recursion might be a problem for large N because C's stack is limited. Wait, but looking at the original code, N is read from input, and memoization is done per current step and last3 characters. So maybe we can represent the memo as a 2D array where the first dimension is the current length (up to N) and the second is the possible combinations of the last three characters.\n\nThe last3 string in the Java code can be represented as a sequence of four characters (since it's length 3, but each can be one of four options). So there are 4^3 = 64 possible combinations. So, for each current step (from 0 to N) and each possible last3 state (64 possibilities), we can store the number of valid ways.\n\nThat's a key insight. So the memo can be a 2D array: memo[N+1][64], where each index represents a state. Then, each state can be encoded as a number. For example, the string \"TTT\" would be 3 * 4^2 + 3 *4 +3 = 63, assuming T is 3, G is 2, C is 1, A is 0. Wait, the tokens are A, C, G, T. So mapping each character to 0,1,2,3. So each of the three characters in last3 can be converted into a base-4 number. For example, the string \"AC\" would be (assuming last3 is three characters, like \"AC...\"\u2014no, wait, the initial call in Java is with \"TTT\". So each state is a three-character string. So each character is one of four options, so the three-character string can be represented as a number between 0 and 4^3 -1 = 63. So encoding the three-character string into an integer.\n\nSo the memo can be a DP table where dp[current][state] represents the number of valid strings of length 'current' ending with the state 'state'. The initial state is \"TTT\", which corresponds to the integer 3*4^2 + 3*4 +3 = 3*(16 +4 +1) ? Wait, 3*4^2 is 3*16=48, plus 3*4=12, plus 3 is 63. So the initial state is 63. \n\nSo in C, we can precompute all possible states (0 to 63), and for each state and current step, calculate the next possibilities. \n\nThe isOK function in Java checks if the last four characters (when a new character is added) form a forbidden pattern. So when we add a new character (c), the last3 becomes last3.substring(1) + c. So the new last3 is the previous last3's last two characters plus the new c. But to check the new four-character combination (the previous last3 plus the new c), we need to see if any of the possible substrings or permutations (swapping adjacent characters) leads to \"AGC\".\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Precompute all possible three-character states (0-63) and for each possible next character (0-3), check if adding this character would create a forbidden four-character sequence.\n\n2. For each state and next character, generate the four-character sequence (old state's three characters + new character), then check if any permutation (swapping adjacent characters) of this sequence contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the Java code's isOK function checks the concatenation of last3 and c (making a four-character string), then checks two things: whether it contains \"AGC\", or any of the possible swaps of adjacent characters (for i in 0..2) creates a string that contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo for the four-character string, after swapping adjacent characters at positions i and i+1, check if any of those swaps result in \"AGC\" being a substring.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Take the four-character string s (last3 + c).\n\n- Check if s contains \"AGC\". If yes, invalid.\n\n- For each i in 0 to 2, swap s[i] and s[i+1], then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of them does, invalid.\n\nOtherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo in C, to implement this, for a given four-character string (represented as an array or a number), we need to check these conditions.\n\nBut how to represent the four-character string? Well, since each character is 0-3 (A, C, G, T), perhaps the four-character string can be converted into a 4-digit base-4 number. But for checking, maybe it's easier to process each character.\n\nAlternatively, when building the four-character string, check each possible permutation.\n\nSo, first, for each possible new character, create the four-character string (the last3's three characters plus the new character). Then, check all possible swaps (the original string and the three possible swaps) for the presence of \"AGC\".\n\nBut how to generate the four-character string. Let's think.\n\nLet's say the current state is the three characters s0, s1, s2. The new character is c. Then the four-character string is s0, s1, s2, c. Then, the possible swaps are:\n\nOriginal: s0 s1 s2 c\n\nSwap 0 and 1: s1 s0 s2 c \u2192 check if any substring of 3 characters is AGC (0,1,2 or 1,2,3?)\n\nWait, the four-character string could have \"AGC\" starting at position 0,1, or 2 (since \"AGC\" is three characters). So for the four-character string, we need to check all possible positions where \"AGC\" could appear.\n\nSimilarly, after swapping, check if any of the possible three-character sequences in the four-character string is \"AGC\".\n\nBut maybe it's easier to check for all possible four-character strings (including after swaps) whether any of them contains \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is:\n\nThe four-character string is s0 s1 s2 s3 (after appending c). Then, check if s contains \"AGC\". If yes, invalid.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2 (positions 0, 1, 2 in the four-character string), swap characters i and i+1, then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of these swaps does, then invalid.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the for loop is for i in 0..2:\n\nThey create a new string by swapping i and i+1 in the four-character string. Then check if any of those swapped strings contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo, in other words, after any single adjacent swap in the four-character string, if any of the resulting strings contains \"AGC\", then the original four-character string is invalid.\n\nSo, for example, the four-character string could be \"AGxC\". Swapping positions 2 and 3 would result in \"AGxC\" \u2192 wait, no. Wait, the original code's isOK function takes the last3 (three characters) and appends a new character, making a four-character string. Then, it checks for \"AGC\" in the original, and in the three possible swaps (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3). Wait, the four-character string has four characters, so positions 0,1,2,3. So the swaps are between 0-1, 1-2, 2-3. So when you swap i and i+1, the four-character string becomes:\n\nFor i=0: positions 0 and 1 swapped.\n\nFor i=1: positions 1 and 2 swapped.\n\nFor i=2: positions 2 and 3 swapped.\n\nSo, the code checks if any of these four possibilities (the original string plus three swaps) contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of them do, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, in C, for a given four-character array, we need to generate all four possibilities (original plus three swaps) and check each for containing \"AGC\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the original code's isOK function:\n\nThe code first checks if the original string contains \"AGC\". Then, for each of the three possible swaps (i=0,1,2), creates a new string by swapping i and i+1, then checks if that new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo, there are four possibilities: the original, and three swaps. If any of those four strings contains \"AGC\", then the four-character string is invalid.\n\nSo, for the four-character string, we need to check all four possibilities.\n\nThus, the approach for checking isOK in C would be:\n\nGiven a four-character array (chars 0-3), check:\n\n1. Does the original array contain \"AGC\" as a substring?\n\n2. For each i in 0,1,2:\n\n   a. swap chars i and i+1.\n\n   b. check if the resulting array contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these checks is true, return false. Else, return true.\n\nSo, to represent the four characters, perhaps we can represent each as a number (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3), then for a four-character array, check each of the four possibilities (original and three swaps) for containing \"AGC\".\n\nSo, in code, for each possible four-character combination (s0, s1, s2, s3), check:\n\nCheck if any of the following sequences have 'AGC' (0,1,2) in consecutive positions:\n\nOriginal:\n\ns0 s1 s2 s3 \u2192 check positions 0-2 (s0, s1, s2), positions 1-3 (s1, s2, s3)\n\nWait, but \"AGC\" is three characters, so in a four-character string, it can start at index 0 or 1. For example, in \"AGCT\", \"AGC\" starts at 0. In \"XAGC\", starts at 1.\n\nSo for each of the four possibilities (original and three swaps), we need to check if any of the three possible triplets (indices 0-2, 1-3) equal to \"AGC\".\n\nWait, no. Because the four-character string can have \"AGC\" in positions 0-2, 1-3, but also in a longer string. Wait, no, for four characters, the possible \"AGC\" substrings are at positions 0-2 and 1-3. For example, \"AGCC\" has \"AGC\" starting at 0 and 1 (if the third character is C). So, for each of the four possibilities (original and three swaps), we need to check whether any triplet in the four characters (positions 0-2, 1-3) is \"AGC\".\n\nWait, but in a four-character string, the triplet can be in positions 0-2, 1-3. So, for each four-character string, check those two triplets for \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's check is for the entire four-character string containing \"AGC\" as a substring, which would check all possible triplets. For example, in a four-character string, \"AGC\" can be at positions 0-2 or 1-3. So, the code's original check for s.contains(\"AGC\") would check both possibilities.\n\nYes. So, in Java, the contains method checks if any substring equals \"AGC\". So, for the four-character string, it checks for the presence of \"AGC\" in either of the two possible positions.\n\nSo, in the isOK function, after creating the four-character string (last3 + c), it checks if that string contains \"AGC\". If yes, returns false.\n\nThen, for each of the three possible swaps, it creates a new string by swapping positions i and i+1, and checks if that new string contains \"AGC\". If any of those do, returns false.\n\nThus, for the C code, when checking a four-character array, we need to:\n\n1. Check if the original array has \"AGC\" as a substring.\n\n2. For each of the three possible swaps (i=0,1,2), create the swapped array, then check if that swapped array has \"AGC\" as a substring.\n\nIf any of these is true, return 0 (invalid), else return 1 (valid).\n\nSo, the first step is to model the four-character array as four integers (each 0-3). Then, check for the presence of \"AGC\" (0,2,1? Wait, wait, the tokens are A, C, G, T. So the mapping is:\n\nA is 0,\n\nC is 1,\n\nG is 2,\n\nT is 3.\n\nWait, the TOKENS array in Java is [\"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\"], so the order is A, C, G, T. So, in the code, when iterating through the tokens, index 0 is A, 1 is C, 2 is G, 3 is T.\n\nSo, \"AGC\" would be 0,2,1. Wait, no. \"A\" is 0, \"G\" is 2, \"C\" is 1. So \"AGC\" is 0,2,1 in terms of their numerical codes.\n\nSo, to check if a triplet is \"AGC\", we need to check if the three characters are 0, 2, 1.\n\nSo, for a triplet (a, b, c), check if a == 0, b == 2, c == 1.\n\nSo, for the four-character array, check if either (s0, s1, s2) is 0,2,1, or (s1, s2, s3) is 0,2,1.\n\nNow, for the C code:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Precompute all possible three-character states (each character is 0-3, so 4^3 = 64 possibilities). Each state can be represented as a 3-digit number in base 4.\n\n- For each state and each possible next character (0-3), form the four-character array (the three digits of the state followed by the next character).\n\n- Check if this four-character array is valid (as per the isOK checks). If valid, then the new state is (state's last two digits) << 4 + next_char.\n\nWait, the state transitions: the new state after adding a character c is the last three characters of the previous state plus c. Since the previous state is three characters (s0, s1, s2), adding c gives a new three-character state (s1, s2, c).\n\nSo, for a state represented as a base-4 number (s0 * 4^2 + s1 *4 + s2), adding a character c would result in the new state (s1 *4^2 + s2 *4 + c).\n\nSo, in code, the new state can be calculated as (state % (4*4)) *4 + c. Because state is s0*16 + s1*4 + s2. The next state is s1*16 + s2*4 + c. Which is equal to (state % 16) *4 + c. Because state % 16 is s1*4 + s2, multiplied by 4 gives s1*4*4 + s2*4, adding c gives s1*16 + s2*4 + c.\n\nSo that's the way to transition the state.\n\nNow, the DP approach:\n\nWe can create a 2D array dp[N+1][64], where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid strings of length i ending with state j.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][63] = 1, since the initial state is \"TTT\" (each T is 3, so 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 63). Wait, but in the Java code, the initial call to dfs is with current=0 and last3=\"TTT\". So when current is 0, the length is zero, but the code builds up from there. Wait, maybe the code's current represents the number of characters added so far, and the N is the target. So for current = N, return 1. So the DP approach would model the current as the number of characters added so far, and when current reaches N, that's a valid count.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dfs function starts with current=0, and for each step, current increments until it reaches N. So for current=0, you have zero characters added, but the state is \"TTT\". So the first character is added when current=0 (since current increments to 1). Hmm, maybe the initial state is \"TTT\" (three characters), and then for each step, you add a character to reach current steps. Wait, perhaps the current in the Java code is the number of characters already added. For example, when current is 0, the initial state is \"TTT\", but the length is 0? That seems confusing. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nThe calc() method calls dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nIn the dfs function:\n\nif (current == N) return 1.\n\nSo, when current is N, that's the base case. So for N steps (current goes from 0 to N), but each step adds a character. So the total length is N.\n\nSo the initial call is with current=0 and last3=\"TTT\". Then, for each call, current increments by 1, and the last3 is updated. So when current reaches N, you have added N characters, and the count is 1.\n\nSo, the initial state (current=0) has no characters added yet. The last3 is the initial state (like a dummy state). Then, each step adds a character, up to N steps.\n\nSo in the DP approach, the state is tracked, and for each step from 0 to N-1, you transition to the next state by adding a character. The count is accumulated when you reach N.\n\nSo, the DP table will have dp[i][state] representing the number of valid strings after i steps, ending with 'state'.\n\nSo, for i=0, the initial state is \"TTT\" (encoded as 63), and dp[0][63] = 1.\n\nFor each step from 0 to N-1:\n\n   For each possible state in dp[i][state]:\n\n      For each possible next_char (0-3):\n\n          form the four-character sequence (state's three chars + next_char)\n\n          check if this sequence is valid (using the isOK checks)\n\n          if valid:\n\n              compute new_state = (state % 16) *4 + next_char\n\n              add dp[i][state] to dp[i+1][new_state]\n\nSo, the answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all possible states.\n\nWait, no. Because the base case is when current reaches N (i steps = N), which returns 1. So, dp[N][*] would all be 1? No, because when current is N, the function returns 1. So the base case is when current == N, return 1, which contributes to the count. So, the DP approach is counting the number of valid ways to reach N steps. So for each step, you track the possible states and the counts. So the total answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all possible states.\n\nBut in the Java code, the memo is stored per current and last3. The initial state is current=0, and the code builds up until current=N. So, the transitions are from current to current+1. So the DP in C would be:\n\nInitialize dp[0][63] = 1.\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   For each state in 0..63:\n\n      if dp[i][state] > 0:\n\n          for each next_char in 0..3:\n\n              check if the four-character sequence (state's three chars + next_char) is valid.\n\n              if valid:\n\n                  new_state = (state % 16) *4 + next_char\n\n                  dp[i+1][new_state] += dp[i][state]\n\n                  dp[i+1][new_state] %= MOD\n\nSo, after N steps, the sum of dp[N][*] is the answer.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when current reaches N, the function returns 1. So in the Java code, each path that reaches current=N contributes 1 to the total count. So the total is the number of valid paths, which is equivalent to the sum of all dp[N][state], where each dp[N][state] is 1 for all valid states. But that's not correct. Wait, the Java code's dfs function returns 1 when current == N, which means that each path that reaches current=N contributes 1. So the total is the number of such paths. So the DP approach is correct, with the transitions accumulating the counts.\n\nSo, in the DP approach, each step adds the number of ways to reach the next state. So, the initial state is dp[0][63] =1, and each step builds up the counts for the next states.\n\nThus, the answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all states.\n\nBut how does the Java code's memoization work? Because the memo is stored per current and last3. When current is N, the memo returns 1, which means that each path to N contributes 1. So the memo is storing the number of valid paths from current to N, given the last3 state. So the DP approach is correct.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the check for the four-character sequence.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor a given state (three characters s0, s1, s2) and next_char (s3), we form the four-character array s = {s0, s1, s2, s3}.\n\nThen, we need to check:\n\n1. Check if any of the four possible sequences (original and three swaps) contains \"AGC\" (0,2,1) as a substring.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, let's model the four characters as s0, s1, s2, s3.\n\nWe need to generate the four possible four-character sequences:\n\nOriginal: s0 s1 s2 s3\n\nSwap 0: s1 s0 s2 s3 (swap positions 0 and 1)\n\nSwap 1: s0 s2 s1 s3 (swap positions 1 and 2)\n\nSwap 2: s0 s1 s3 s2 (swap positions 2 and 3)\n\nWait, no. Swapping i and i+1 in the original four-character array.\n\nOriginal array: [0][1][2][3]\n\nswap i=0: swap positions 0 and 1 \u2192 new array is [1][0][2][3]\n\nswap i=1: swap positions 1 and 2 \u2192 [0][2][1][3]\n\nswap i=2: swap positions 2 and 3 \u2192 [0][1][3][2]\n\nThen, for each of these four arrays (original and three swaps), check if any of them contains the triplet 0,2,1 (AGC) in positions 0-2 or 1-3.\n\nSo for each of these four arrays, check:\n\nfor the array a0, a1, a2, a3:\n\nif (a0 == 0 && a1 == 2 && a2 == 1) \u2192 check positions 0-2\n\nOR\n\nif (a1 == 0 && a2 == 2 && a3 == 1) \u2192 check positions 1-3\n\nIf either is true, then this array is invalid.\n\nSo, for each of the four possible arrays (original and three swaps), check if either of these two conditions is true.\n\nIf any of the four arrays has either condition, then the four-character sequence is invalid.\n\nThus, the code for checking validity would be:\n\nint is_valid(int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3) {\n\n    // Check original and three swaps\n\n    int arr[4][4] = {\n\n        {s0, s1, s2, s3}, // original\n\n        {s1, s0, s2, s3}, // swap 0-1\n\n        {s0, s2, s1, s3}, // swap 1-2\n\n        {s0, s1, s3, s2}  // swap 2-3\n\n    };\n\n    for (int k = 0; k <4; k++) {\n\n        int a0 = arr[k][0];\n\n        int a1 = arr[k][1];\n\n        int a2 = arr[k][2];\n\n        int a3 = arr[k][3];\n\n        // Check for AGC in positions 0-2: a0=0, a1=2, a2=1\n\n        if (a0 == 0 && a1 == 2 && a2 == 1) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n        // Check for AGC in positions 1-3: a1=0, a2=2, a3=1\n\n        if (a1 ==0 && a2 ==2 && a3 ==1) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nSo this function returns 1 if the four-character sequence is valid, else 0.\n\nBut wait, the original code checks if any of the four arrays (original and three swaps) contains \"AGC\" as a substring. So for each of the four arrays, check both possible triplets (0-2 and 1-3). If any of the four arrays has either triplet, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the function returns 0 (invalid) if any of the four arrays has either triplet.\n\nNow, with this function, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the DP approach:\n\nInitialize dp[0][63] = 1.\n\nFor each step i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   for each state in 0..63:\n\n       if dp[i][state] is 0, skip.\n\n       s0 = state / 16 (since state is s0*16 + s1*4 + s2)\n\n       s1 = (state /4) %4\n\n       s2 = state %4\n\n       for next_char in 0..3:\n\n           s3 = next_char\n\n           if is_valid(s0, s1, s2, s3) is 1:\n\n               new_state = (state % 16) *4 + next_char \u2192 (s1 *4 + s2) *4 + next_char = s1 *16 + s2*4 + next_char\n\n               dp[i+1][new_state] = (dp[i+1][new_state] + dp[i][state]) % MOD\n\nSo, after processing all steps, the answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all states.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nMOD is 1e9+7.\n\nN is read from input.\n\nWe need to create a DP table with N+1 rows (0 to N) and 64 columns.\n\nBut since N can be up to, say, 1e5 (but in programming competition problems, N is probably up to 1e2 or 1e3). Wait, the original code uses memoization with a hash map, which suggests that the constraints are manageable. For example, N up to 1e2. But in C, for N up to 1e2, using a 2D array of size (1e2 +1)*64 is manageable.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify, but in programming competitions, similar problems have N up to 1e5. Wait, but given the original code uses recursion and memoization with a hash map, perhaps N is up to around 100, because for N=100, 100 *64=6400 entries in the memo, which is manageable. But for larger N, the code may not be efficient. However, the translated C code should handle it with DP.\n\nBut in the problem, the original code uses N up to whatever the user inputs. So in C, we can read N and handle it with a DP table of size N+1 x64.\n\nBut if N is up to say 1e5, this would require (1e5 +1)*64 * sizeof(long) which is about (1e5)*64*8 = 5e7 bytes, which is about 50MB, which is manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can use a 2D array dp[2][64], since for each step, we only need the current and next step. This way, even for large N, memory is manageable.\n\nBecause for each step i, we compute i+1 based on i. So we can alternate between two rows: previous and current.\n\nSo, initializing prev as 0, and current as 1.\n\nSo, the code would have:\n\nlong long dp[2][64];\n\nint prev = 0;\n\nmemset(dp[prev], 0, sizeof(dp[prev]));\n\ndp[prev][63] = 1; // initial state \"TTT\"\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int curr = 1 - prev;\n\n    memset(dp[curr], 0, sizeof(dp[curr]));\n\n    for (int state = 0; state <64; state++) {\n\n        if (dp[prev][state] == 0) continue;\n\n        // decompose state into s0, s1, s2\n\n        int s0 = state / 16;\n\n        int s1 = (state /4) %4;\n\n        int s2 = state %4;\n\n        for (int c =0; c <4; c++) {\n\n            int s3 = c;\n\n            // check if valid\n\n            if (is_valid(s0, s1, s2, s3)) {\n\n                int new_state = (s1 *4 + s2) *4 + c;\n\n                dp[curr][new_state] = (dp[curr][new_state] + dp[prev][state]) % MOD;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    prev = curr;\n\n}\n\nAfter N steps, the answer is the sum of dp[prev][state] for all states.\n\nSo, sum all entries in dp[prev][0..63].\n\nThus, the code would read N from input, initialize the DP, loop N times, updating the DP for each step, then sum the results.\n\nNow, the is_valid function is as described earlier.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead N.\n\nInitialize the DP.\n\nLoop N times, updating the DP each time.\n\nSum the results.\n\nNow, implement the is_valid function.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle the four possibilities (original and three swaps).\n\nSo, the code for is_valid:\n\nint is_valid(int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3) {\n\n    int i;\n\n    // Check original and three swaps.\n\n    int cases[4][4] = {\n\n        {s0, s1, s2, s3},\n\n        {s1, s0, s2, s3},\n\n        {s0, s2, s1, s3},\n\n        {s0, s1, s3, s2}\n\n    };\n\n    for (i =0; i <4; i++) {\n\n        int a0 = cases[i][0];\n\n        int a1 = cases[i][1];\n\n        int a2 = cases[i][2];\n\n        int a3 = cases[i][3];\n\n        // Check for AGC in positions 0-2 (a0, a1, a2)\n\n        if (a0 ==0 && a1 ==2 && a2 ==1) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n        // Check for AGC in positions 1-3 (a1, a2, a3)\n\n        if (a1 ==0 && a2 ==2 && a3 ==1) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting all together:\n\nThe C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007LL\n\nint is_valid(int s0, int s1, int s2, int s3) {\n\n    int cases[4][4] = {\n\n        {s0, s1, s2, s3},\n\n        {s1, s0, s2, s3},\n\n        {s0, s2, s1, s3},\n\n        {s0, s1, s3, s2}\n\n    };\n\n    for (int i = 0; i <4; ++i) {\n\n        int a0 = cases[i][0];\n\n        int a1 = cases[i][1];\n\n        int a2 = cases[i][2];\n\n        int a3 = cases[i][3];\n\n        if (a0 ==0 && a1 ==2 && a2 ==1) return 0;\n\n        if (a1 ==0 && a2 ==2 && a3 ==1) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    long long dp[2][64];\n\n    int prev = 0;\n\n    memset(dp[prev], 0, sizeof(dp[prev]));\n\n    dp[prev][63] = 1; // Initial state TTT (3,3,3) \u2192 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63\n\n    for (int i =0; i <N; ++i) {\n\n        int curr = 1 - prev;\n\n        memset(dp[curr], 0, sizeof(dp[curr]));\n\n        for (int state =0; state <64; ++state) {\n\n            if (dp[prev][state] ==0) continue;\n\n            int s0 = state /16;\n\n            int s1 = (state /4) %4;\n\n            int s2 = state %4;\n\n            for (int c=0; c<4; ++c) {\n\n                if (is_valid(s0, s1, s2, c)) {\n\n                    int new_state = (s1 *4 + s2) *4 + c;\n\n                    dp[curr][new_state] = (dp[curr][new_state] + dp[prev][state]) % MOD;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        prev = curr;\n\n    }\n\n    long long ans =0;\n\n    for (int state =0; state <64; ++state) {\n\n        ans = (ans + dp[prev][state]) % MOD;\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the transition, new_state is (s1 *4 + s2) *4 + c. Which is s1 *16 + s2*4 +c. Which is the new state composed of s1, s2, c. That's correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, the sample input 3 would output 61.\n\nBut let's see: for N=3, the number of valid strings is 4^3=64 minus the number of invalid strings. The forbidden strings are those containing \"AGC\" in any of the four possible ways (original or swaps). For N=3, there are 3 characters, but the check is for any four-character string (but N=3, so the four-character sequence is only possible if N=4. Wait, maybe the sample input is N=3, the answer is 61 as per some online sources. But perhaps I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, possible mistakes:\n\n- In the transition to new_state, perhaps the formula is wrong.\n\nBut the new state is s1, s2, c. So, s1 is multiplied by 16 (4^2), s2 by4 (4^1), c by1 (4^0). So yes.\n\n- In the is_valid function, checking for a1 ==0, a2 ==2, a3 ==1. That's correct for the triplet in positions 1-3.\n\n- The initial state is 63 (TTT), which is correct.\n\n- The code uses long long for the DP values to handle large numbers modulo 1e9+7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this should be the correct translation."
