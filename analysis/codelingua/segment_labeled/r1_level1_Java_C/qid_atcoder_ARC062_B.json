Assuming the input is not longer than, say, 100000 characters. We can declare a char array of sufficient size. 2. Iterate over each character in the string. For each index i (starting from 0), check if it's even or odd. If even, the player's character is 'g'; if odd, it's 'p'. Then compare with the input character. 3. For each comparison, if my and his are different, adjust the score. If my is 'p', add 1 (since if his is 'g', then the player plays p and gains 1 point). If my is 'g', subtract 1 (since the player played g, but his is p, so the player loses a point). Wait, the original code says:\n\nscore += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1; So when my is 'p' (i is odd), and his is not equal (so his is 'g'), add 1.
