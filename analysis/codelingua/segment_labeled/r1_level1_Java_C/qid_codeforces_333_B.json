Then, it processes m pairs of integers, adding certain rows and columns to banned sets. The main logic seems to calculate an answer based on the number of banned rows and columns, adjusting if the grid size is odd.\n\nFirst, in Java, they use a Set for bannedRows and bannedCols. Since C doesn't have a built-in set, I'll need to use arrays or perhaps hash tables. But considering the possible size, since n can be up to 1e5 or something (but in the code, rows and cols are added if they are between 1 and n, but only if they are not on the edge?), maybe a dynamic array or a boolean array would work. Wait, the Java code checks if r >1 and r <n. So the rows that are banned are those in the middle. For example, if n is 5, then rows 2,3,4 are considered. So for a grid, the banned rows are the ones not on the top or bottom edge.\n\nSo for C, perhaps we can create two boolean arrays, one for rows and columns. Each entry indicates whether that row or column is banned. The initial answer is (n-2)*2, which I think is the maximum possible possible middle rows and columns. Then subtract the number of banned rows and cols. But if n is odd, check if the middle row and column are both not banned, then subtract one more.\n\nWait, let me think. The Java code computes answer as (n-2)*2. That's because for each row from 2 to n-1 (total n-2 rows), and same for columns. But the answer starts with this maximum, then subtracts the number of banned rows and cols. Then, if n is odd, check if the middle element (both row and column) is present. If neither is banned, then subtract 1. Otherwise, no.\n\nSo in C, I need to replicate this logic. The challenge is handling the banned rows and columns. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5, but m can be up to 1e5 as well. So using a boolean array of size n+1 (since rows are 1-based) would be feasible.\n\nSo first, in C, I'll need to read n and m. Then initialize two boolean arrays (or perhaps use bitsets, but for simplicity, using arrays of int or char) to track banned rows and columns. For each of the m pairs, read r and c. For each r, if r is between 2 and n-1 (since in Java code, r>1 and r <n), then mark it as banned. Same for c.\n\nOnce all pairs are processed, count the number of banned rows and columns. Then compute answer as (n-2)*2 - banned_rows_count - banned_cols_count. Then check if n is odd. If it is, compute mid as (n+1)/2. Check if both row mid and column mid are not banned. If so, subtract 1 from answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Initialize banned_rows and banned_cols arrays (size n+1, indexes from 1 to n). Initialize all to 0 (false). Then for each m input, check the r and c and set the corresponding array entries to 1 (true) if they are in the middle.\n\n3. Count the number of banned rows and cols by summing the arrays from 2 to n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because in Java, the code adds to the set only if r is between 2 and n-1. So for the C code, when processing each input pair, if r is in that range, mark it in the banned_rows array. So the banned_rows array will have true for exactly those rows that are in the middle and have been banned. Then, the count of banned rows is the number of true entries in banned_rows, same for cols.\n\nSo the count for banned rows is the size of the bannedRows set in Java. So in C, the banned_rows array is a boolean array, and the count is the number of 1s in it.\n\nBut in Java, the code uses a HashSet, which automatically avoids duplicates. So in C, when processing the input, if a row is added multiple times, the array would be set to 1 each time, but duplicates are handled automatically since setting to 1 multiple times doesn't change the value. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each of the m pairs:\n\n   - Read r and c.\n\n   - If r > 1 and r < n, set banned_rows[r] = 1.\n\n   - If c > 1 and c < n, set banned_cols[c] = 1.\n\nThen, count the number of banned rows by iterating from 2 to n-1, summing banned_rows[i], and same for columns.\n\nCompute answer = (n-2)*2 - banned_rows_count - banned_cols_count.\n\nIf n is odd:\n\n   mid = (n+1)/2.\n\n   if banned_rows[mid] is 0 and banned_cols[mid] is 0, then subtract 1.\n\nFinally, print answer.\n\nNow, handling input. In Java, the FastReader uses a BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. In C, we need to read input efficiently. For that, using scanf is acceptable, but sometimes, with large inputs, it's better to read line by line. However, given that m can be up to 1e5, using scanf for each pair may be efficient enough.\n\nBut let's think: the code reads m lines, each with two integers r and c. So for each of m lines, read r and c. So in C, for each iteration, use scanf(\"%d %d\", &r, &c).\n\nBut in C, we need to make sure that the input is read correctly. So perhaps:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n\n   int r, c;\n\n   scanf(\"%d %d\", &r, &c);\n\n   if (r > 1 && r < n) {\n\n      banned_rows[r] = 1;\n\n   }\n\n   if (c > 1 && c < n) {\n\n      banned_cols[c] = 1;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut in Java, the code adds to the set even if the same r is added multiple times. But in C, since the array is 1 for any occurrence, duplicates are handled.\n\nNow, the arrays for banned_rows and cols. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5, but in practice, the maximum n is not given. So we need to dynamically allocate the arrays. But in C, variable-length arrays (VLAs) are possible if the compiler supports them. However, for large n, stack allocation may cause stack overflow. So better to use dynamic allocation with malloc.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nAllocate banned_rows and banned_cols as arrays of size n+2 (indexes 0..n+1?), but probably n+1 is sufficient. Then initialize all to 0.\n\nProcess the m pairs.\n\nThen count banned rows and cols:\n\nint banned_rows_count = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n-1; i++) {\n\n   banned_rows_count += banned_rows[i];\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for cols.\n\nThen calculate answer.\n\nCheck if n is odd. If n%2 !=0:\n\n   mid = (n+1)/2.\n\n   if banned_rows[mid] == 0 and banned_cols[mid] ==0 \u2192 decrement answer by 1.\n\nPrint answer.\n\nSo now, code steps:\n\nIn C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, m;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    // Allocate arrays for banned_rows and banned_cols\n\n    int *banned_rows = (int *)calloc(n + 1, sizeof(int));\n\n    int *banned_cols = (int *)calloc(n + 1, sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n\n        int r, c;\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &r, &c);\n\n        if (r > 1 && r < n) {\n\n            banned_rows[r] = 1;\n\n        }\n\n        if (c > 1 && c < n) {\n\n            banned_cols[c] = 1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Count banned rows\n\n    int banned_rows_count = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n-1; i++) {\n\n        banned_rows_count += banned_rows[i];\n\n    }\n\n    // Count banned cols\n\n    int banned_cols_count = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n-1; i++) {\n\n        banned_cols_count += banned_cols[i];\n\n    }\n\n    int answer = (n - 2) * 2 - banned_rows_count - banned_cols_count;\n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) {\n\n        int mid = (n + 1) / 2;\n\n        if (!banned_rows[mid] && !banned_cols[mid]) {\n\n            answer--;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", answer);\n\n    free(banned_rows);\n\n    free(banned_cols);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, when n is even, mid is not checked. So the code for the mid check is only when n is odd.\n\nIn C, the code correctly checks if n is odd. For example, n=5, mid is 3. If both row 3 and column 3 are not banned, then subtract 1.\n\nBut why? Because when the grid is odd, the center cell is considered. If neither the row nor the column is banned, then in the initial calculation, both are counted (since (n-2)*2 counts all possible middle rows and columns). But the center cell's row and column are in the middle. So if both are present, they are counted as separate. But in reality, for the center cell, the row and column may be considered overlapping. Wait, perhaps the Java code's logic is that when the grid is odd, and the middle row and column are both not banned, then there's an overlap. So in the maximum possible, (n-2)*2 counts each row and column once. But the middle row and column (when n is odd) are counted once each. However, if both are present, perhaps they are considered as a single point. So the maximum is (n-2)*2 - 1 in that case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code's logic is that for even n, there's no overlapping, but for odd n, the middle row and column are the same line. Wait, no. For a grid, the rows and columns are separate. The center cell is at (mid, mid). So the maximum possible middle rows is (n-2), same for columns. So the initial answer is 2*(n-2). Then, each banned row or column subtracts 1. Then, for the case where the grid is odd, if the middle row and column are both not banned, then their sum would have been 2 in the initial answer. But perhaps the actual maximum is 2*(n-2) - 1. Because in the mirroring scenario, perhaps the middle row and column can't both be used. So the Java code subtracts 1 in that case.\n\nSo the code's logic is: when n is odd, and both the middle row and column are allowed, then they are counted as 2 in the initial answer. But in reality, they can't be both used because of overlapping? Or perhaps because the code is counting the maximum number of possible edges that can be used in a mirroring scenario. I'm not entirely sure, but the Java code's logic seems to be that if n is odd, and the middle row and column are not banned, then the answer needs to be reduced by 1. So that's part of the original code's logic.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, the check for n%2 !=0 is correct, and the code should check if both mid row and column are not banned, and subtract 1 in that case.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly. For example, when m=0, then no rows or columns are banned. So answer is (n-2)*2, then subtract 0. Then check for n odd.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is 2. Then (n-2)*2 is 0. Banned rows and cols can't exist (since r>1 and r <2 implies r must be 1.5, which is not integer. So banned rows and cols would be zero. So answer is 0. Then check if n is odd (n=2 is even), so no subtraction. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=0. Then banned rows and cols count is 0. answer is (3-2)*2=2. Then check if n is odd. Yes. mid=(3+1)/2=2. Check if row 2 and col 2 are not banned. Since m=0, they are not. So answer=2-1=1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in C:\n\nUse calloc to allocate arrays initialized to zero.\n\nCheck for possible errors in reading input. But assuming that the input is correct as per programming competition standards.\n\nSo the C code should work.\n\nI think that's all. The code should be straightforward. The main part is translating the Java's Set usage into boolean arrays and then counting the entries."
