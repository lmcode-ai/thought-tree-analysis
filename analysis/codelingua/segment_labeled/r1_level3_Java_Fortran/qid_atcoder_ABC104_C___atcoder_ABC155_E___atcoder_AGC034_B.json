The second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string (a large number) and computes the minimum number of bills.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_AGC034_B) reads a string, replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", and then counts the number of valid moves.\n\n However, note the requirement: \n   - Only the first block reads input, and only the last block writes output.\n   - Intermediate steps process without I/O.\n\n Since the three programs are independent and meant to be run in sequence (with the output of the first being the input of the second, and so on) but they have different input types, we must reconsider.\n\n But note: the original Java programs are independent and each reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let's see the outputs and inputs:\n\n Program 1: outputs an integer (min) -> that would be the input for Program 2?\n Program 2: expects a string (a number) but the output of program1 is an integer. So we convert the integer to string? \n Program 3: expects a string (the same as program2? or a different one?)\n\n But wait, the example programs are from different contests and have different purposes. The problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n However, the three programs have different input formats. This implies that the output of the first must be the input of the second, and the output of the second the input of the third.\n\n But:\n\n Program1: outputs an integer (min) -> so the next program (Program2) must take that integer as input? But Program2 expects a string of digits? That matches: we can write the integer as a string.\n\n Program2: outputs an integer (bills) -> then Program3 expects a string? Actually, Program3 expects a string that may contain 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. But the output of Program2 is an integer. How can that be the input to Program3?\n\n This does not seem to form a natural chain. Therefore, we must reconsider the problem.\n\n The problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But note: the three programs are independent. They do not share data structures. So the only way is:\n\n  - The first program (ABC104_C) reads D, G, and then arrays p and c. It outputs an integer (min1).\n  - The second program (ABC155_E) reads a string (which is the string representation of min1? or another input?) and outputs an integer (min2).\n  - The third program (AGC034_B) reads a string (which is the string representation of min2? or another input?) and outputs a long.\n\n However, the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So we must assume that the entire input for the chain is the input for the first program? Then the next programs take the output of the previous? \n\n But the inputs for the second and third programs are not provided. This is confusing.\n\n Clarification from the problem: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n Therefore, the entire input is read at the beginning (which is the input for the first program). Then the output of the first program becomes the input for the second program (without I/O), and the output of the second becomes the input for the third. Finally, the output of the third is printed.\n\n However, the input for the first program (ABC104_C) is:\n   D G\n   p0 c0\n   p1 c1\n   ...\n\n The input for the second program (ABC155_E) is a string (a number). So we must convert the output of the first (an integer) to a string to feed as input to the second.\n\n Similarly, the output of the second (an integer) must be converted to a string to feed as input to the third.\n\n But note: the third program (AGC034_B) expects a string that may contain 'A', 'B', 'C'. However, if we feed it a string of digits (the output of the second program) then what happens?\n\n The third program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the moves. But if the string is composed of digits, then there are no letters? Then the count would be zero? That doesn't make sense.\n\n This implies that the three programs are not intended to be chained by the output of the previous being the input of the next? \n\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Alternatively, the entire input might be provided at the beginning and include the inputs for all three programs? But the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input\".\n\n And: \"when run on the same input\" meaning the same input as the first program? \n\n After re-examining the problem, it says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\n Therefore, we must assume that the input for the entire chain is the input for the first program. The output of the first program (as a string) becomes the input for the second program, and the output of the second program (as a string) becomes the input for the third. The final output is the output of the third.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (D, G, and arrays p and c).\n  Step 2: Run the logic of the first program to get an integer (min1).\n  Step 3: Convert min1 to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) and use that as the input for the second program.\n  Step 4: Run the second program's logic on that string to get an integer (min2).\n  Step 5: Convert min2 to a string and use that as the input for the third program.\n  Step 6: Run the third program's logic on that string to get a long (cnt).\n  Step 7: Print cnt.\n\n However, the third program's output is the final output.\n\n But note: the third program in the original code outputs a long (which is the count). So we output that.\n\n But wait: the original chain would output three things? Actually, the problem says the output of each is the input of the next, so only the last output is shown.\n\n So in Fortran:\n\n  We read the first program's input (D, G, p, c) from stdin (only one read at the beginning).\n\n  Then we compute the first program's result (min1).\n\n  Then we convert min1 to a string (call it str1) and use it as input for the second program.\n\n  The second program takes a string (the digits of min1) and computes min2.\n\n  Then we convert min2 to a string (str2) and use it as input for the third program.\n\n  The third program takes a string (the digits of min2) and computes cnt (which is the answer for the third program).\n\n  Then we write cnt to stdout.\n\n However, the third program's output is the final output.\n\n But note: the third program in the original code replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts. But if we give it a string of digits, then there are no letters? Then the count will be zero? \n\n This does not make sense. Therefore, we must reexamine the problem.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the three programs are independent and the entire input for the chain is the concatenation of the inputs for the three programs? But the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\".\n\n And: \"when run on the same input\" meaning the same input as the entire chain? \n\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to the chain is the input to the first program. The second program takes the output of the first, and the third takes the output of the second.\n\n However, the third program expects a string that contains only 'A','B','C'? But the output of the second is an integer. This mismatch suggests that the three programs are not intended to be chained in this manner.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the problem intends the chain to be:\n\n   Input for the entire program: the input for the first program (D, G, p, c) and then the input for the second and third programs are generated from the outputs of the previous programs.\n\n Since the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", we must chain them by converting the integer outputs to strings.\n\n Therefore:\n\n   Step 1: Read D and G, then arrays p and c (size D) from stdin.\n\n   Step 2: Compute min1 (as in ABC104_C).\n\n   Step 3: Convert min1 to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits) -> this is the input for ABC155_E.\n\n   Step 4: Process the string (which is the digits of min1) as in ABC155_E to get min2.\n\n   Step 5: Convert min2 to a string -> this is the input for AGC034_B.\n\n   Step 6: Process the string (digits of min2) as in AGC034_B: replace \"BC\" by \"D\", then count the moves? But note: the string is digits, so there is no 'B' or 'C'. Therefore, the replacement does nothing. Then the program counts:\n\n        It iterates and when it sees 'A' it increments tmp, when it sees 'D' (which is the replacement for \"BC\", but we don't have \"BC\") then it adds tmp to cnt. Otherwise (if it sees a digit that is not 'A' or 'D') it resets tmp.\n\n        Since the string is digits, every character is a digit and not 'A' or 'D'. Therefore, we would reset tmp at every character? and never add? So cnt=0.\n\n   This leads to the final output 0.\n\n   This does not seem to be the intended behavior of the original chain.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I must stick to the problem: the chain is defined by the outputs of one being the input of the next.\n\n Therefore, I will code accordingly.\n\n Steps in Fortran:\n\n  1. Read the input for the first program: D (integer) and G (integer, but in the first program it is long, but in Fortran we can use integer(kind=8) for large integers? Note: G can be up to 10^7? The problem says long in Java, so we use integer(kind=8) for G? Actually, the problem says G is long in Java. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for large integers.\n\n  2. Read the arrays p and c (size D).\n\n  3. Compute min1 (as in the first program) using a bitmask. We'll use an integer for bitmask, and loop from 0 to (2**D - 1). Note: D is at most 10, so 2^10=1024.\n\n  4. Convert min1 to a string (character array) to feed to the second program.\n\n  5. For the second program:\n        We have a string (the min1 as string). We need to reverse it? The original program reverses the string to process from least significant digit? Actually, the program does:\n            for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n            }\n        So we have an array of digits in reverse order (with an extra position at the end).\n\n        We'll create an array `digits` of size (len+1) (with len being the length of the string). We process each digit.\n\n        Then we simulate the algorithm to compute min2 (bills).\n\n  6. Convert min2 to a string.\n\n  7. For the third program:\n        We have a string (min2 as string). We replace every occurrence of \"BC\" by \"D\". But note: the string is digits, so there is no \"BC\". So the string remains unchanged.\n\n        Then we traverse the string and:\n            - if we see 'A', we increment a temporary counter (tmp)\n            - if we see 'D', we add tmp to the total count (cnt)\n            - otherwise, we reset tmp to 0.\n\n        Since the string is digits, every character is not 'A' and not 'D', so we reset tmp at every step? Then cnt remains 0.\n\n  8. Output cnt (which is 0).\n\n However, this is the behavior we get.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would run:\n\n   Program1: reads D, G, p, c and outputs min1 (an integer).\n\n   Then we run Program2: we input the string representation of min1 (without any extra characters) and it outputs min2.\n\n   Then we run Program3: we input the string representation of min2 and it outputs 0 (because the string is digits).\n\n So the final output is 0.\n\n Therefore, we code accordingly.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n  - We'll use integer(kind=8) for large integers? But note: in the first program, G is long (which is 64-bit). Also, the scores can be large? The first program uses int for score? Actually, the first program uses `int score` and `long G`. But the problem says G is long. However, the first program uses `int` for `score` which might overflow? But note: D is at most 10, and each problem gives at most 100*(i+1)*100 (because p[i] <= 100) -> maximum per problem: 100*10*100 = 100000, and 10 problems -> 1e6, so int is enough? But the problem says G can be up to 10^7? So 10^7 is within int? (2e9). So it's safe? But the first program uses `int score` and `long G`. Actually, the first program compares `score` (int) with `G` (long). This might cause problems? But the first program in Java runs without overflow? We'll use integer(kind=4) for the first program? Or use integer(kind=8) for everything to be safe.\n\n  However, the problem constraints: D <= 10, p[i] <= 100, and c[i] up to 10^5? Then the maximum score: 100*10*100 + 10^5 = 100000+100000 = 200000? So it's safe with 4-byte integers? But G is long? Actually, the problem says: \"G can be as large as 10^7\", which fits in 4-byte integer? (since 10^7 is 10 million). But in Java, long is 64-bit. To be safe, we use 8-byte integers for G and the score? But the first program uses int for score. We'll follow the original: use 4-byte for the bitmask and counters, but for G and the score we use 8-byte? Because G is long.\n\n  Actually, the first program: \n        int D = ...; \n        long G = ...;\n\n        int score = 0;   // but then they are adding: 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i] -> which is int? but then compared to long G.\n\n  We'll use 8-byte for G and for the score in the first program to avoid overflow? Because 100*(i+1)*p[i] might be 100*10*100 = 100000, and then multiplied by the number of problems? Actually, the maximum total score is the sum over all problems: maximum 100000 per problem? 10 problems -> 1e6? So 4-byte is safe? But the problem says G is long, so we must read G as 8-byte. Then we compare a 4-byte score with a 8-byte G? That is safe? But in Fortran, if we use integer(4) for score and integer(8) for G, the comparison will promote the 4-byte to 8-byte? We can do that.\n\n  However, to be consistent and avoid overflow, we will use integer(8) for:\n        G, score, and the min1 (because min1 is the number of problems, which is at most 10*100 = 1000, so 4-byte is enough, but we'll use 8-byte for all integers to avoid type confusion?).\n\n  Alternatively, we can use integer(4) for the bitmask and the indices, and integer(8) for the large numbers.\n\n  Let me decide:\n\n      D: integer(4) (since D <= 10)\n      p, c: integer(4) arrays? because p[i] and c[i] are integers (p[i] <= 100, c[i] up to 10^5 -> 10^5 fits in 4-byte?).\n\n      G: integer(8)\n      score: integer(8) -> because we are adding up to 10 problems, each contributing at most 100*10*100 + 100000 = 200000, so total 2e6, which fits in 4-byte? But if we use 8-byte we are safe.\n\n      min1: integer(8) (but it is the number of problems, at most 1000, so 4-byte is enough, but we'll use 8-byte for consistency).\n\n  For the second program:\n        The input string for the second program is the digits of min1 (which is at most 1000 -> 4 digits). Then the algorithm in the second program uses an array of digits (size len+1). We'll use integer(4) for the digits and bills? But bills is the output (min2) which we store as integer(8).\n\n  For the third program:\n        The input string for the third program is the digits of min2 (which is the output of the second program). The algorithm then computes a long (cnt) which we output.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      integer(4) for indices, D, p, c, bitmask, i, j, etc.\n\n      integer(8) for G, score, min1, min2, cnt, and the bills in the second program? Actually, the second program's bills is the output min2, which we will store as integer(8). Also, the digits array in the second program: we use integer(4) for each digit? But the digits are 0-9, so 4-byte is enough.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Read D (integer(4)) and G (integer(8))\n      Allocate arrays p and c (size D) of integer(4)\n      Read p and c\n\n      min1 = a big number (INF = 100000, but we use 100000_8 to have 8-byte)\n\n      Loop over bitmask from 0 to (2**D - 1) [bitmask is integer(4)]\n\n          score = 0\n          solve_num = 0\n          For i=0 to D-1\n             if the i-th bit of bitmask is set, then:\n                 score = score + 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i)\n                 solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\n          If (score < G) then\n             For i = D-1 down to 0\n                 if the i-th bit is not set\n                    For j=1 to p(i)-1   (we are going to solve j problems of the i-th category)\n                         score = score + 100*(i+1)\n                         solve_num = solve_num + 1\n                         if (score >= G) exit the innermost two loops (we can break out of the inner two loops)\n\n          If (score >= G) then\n             min1 = min(min1, solve_num)\n\n      Now, min1 is computed.\n\n      Convert min1 to a string: we'll write it to a character variable.\n\n      For the second program:\n\n          Let s = trim(adjustl( the string of min1 ))   -> remove leading spaces and left adjust.\n          Let n = len_trim(s)   -> the length of the string without trailing spaces.\n\n          We need to create an array `digits` of size (0:n) [we use 0-indexed?] or (1:n+1). We'll use an array of size n+1 (index 1 to n+1). Actually, the Java program uses an array of length n+1 (for digits[0..n], with n = string length). Then:\n\n          For i from 1 to n:\n              digits(i) = ichar(s(n-i+1:n-i+1)) - ichar('0')   -> because we reverse the string.\n\n          We also set digits(n+1) = 0 (for the extra position).\n\n          Then we do:\n\n          bills = 0   (integer(8))\n          digits(n+1) = 0   (the extra digit at the end)\n\n          Then we loop i from 1 to n+1:\n\n             if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                 digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                 digits(i) = 0\n             end if\n\n             Then we do the condition:\n\n                 if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                     bills = bills + digits(i)\n                 else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                     if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then   -> note: when i = n+1, then we are accessing digits(n+2) which is out of bounds? But the Java program has an array of length n+1, and then they use digits[i+1] for i from 0 to n (which is the last index n, then i+1 = n+1 is the extra we set to 0). We have set digits(n+1)=0 and we are looping i=1 to n+1. When i = n+1, then digits(i+1) would be beyond the array. So we must allocate an extra space at the end? We allocated from 1 to n+1, and we need to set an extra digit at n+2? \n\n          How to handle: We'll create an array `digits` of size 1 to n+2, set the first n digits (from the reversed string) and set digits(n+1)=0 and digits(n+2)=0 (as a safeguard for the last step).\n\n          Alternatively, we can check the index: for i from 1 to n (not including n+1) for the condition of 5? But the Java program loops for i from 0 to n (which is the length of the array, which is n+1). So we must include i = n+1? Then we need to access digits(i+1) at i = n+1 -> that would be n+2. So we allocate to n+2 and set digits(n+2)=0.\n\n          Steps for the second program:\n\n             Let len = n   (the length of the string)\n             Allocate an array `digits(1:len+2)` and set to 0.\n\n             For i = 1 to len:\n                 digits(i) = character at position (len-i+1) of the string -> converted to integer.\n\n             Then set digits(len+1) = 0, digits(len+2)=0.\n\n             bills = 0\n             do i = 1, len+1   (because we have an extra digit at the end that we set to 0, and we want to process the last digit that we set? Actually, the Java program loops i from 0 to n (which is the length of the array, which is n+1) -> so we loop i=1 to len+1.\n\n                 if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                     digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                     digits(i) = 0\n                 end if\n\n                 if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                     bills = bills + digits(i)\n                 else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                     if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                     end if\n                     bills = bills + 5\n                 else   ! digits(i) > 5\n                     digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                     bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n                 end if\n\n          Now min2 = bills.\n\n      Then convert min2 to a string.\n\n      For the third program:\n\n          Let s2 = the string representation of min2 (without spaces)\n\n          Then we replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". But note: the string is digits, so we skip this step? Actually, we do:\n\n          We'll create a new string by scanning for \"BC\", but since the string is digits, we can skip? Or we do:\n\n          We'll traverse the string and whenever we see 'B' and then 'C', we replace by 'D'. But we are going to create a new string? The Java program does: s.replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\"). Then we traverse the new string.\n\n          Since the string is digits, we don't have 'B' or 'C', so the string remains the same.\n\n          Then:\n\n          cnt = 0 (integer(8))\n          tmp = 0 (integer(8))\n\n          do i = 1, len_trim(s2)\n             c = s2(i:i)\n             if (c == 'A') then\n                 tmp = tmp + 1\n             else if (c == 'D') then   ! because we replaced \"BC\" by \"D\", but we didn't have any so we don't get 'D'\n                 cnt = cnt + tmp\n             else\n                 tmp = 0\n             end if\n\n          Then output cnt.\n\n      But note: the string is digits, so every character is not 'A' and not 'D', so we set tmp=0 at every step? Then cnt=0.\n\n      Then we write(cnt) as the final output.\n\n  However, the chain is defined by the outputs of the previous programs, so we do this.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: We must not do any I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n  We'll write the entire program in Fortran.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      implicit none\n\n      !

So we assign:\n      do i = 1, len1\n          ! the i-th digit in the reversed array is the (len1 - i + 1)-th character of the string.\n          digits(i) = ichar(s1(len1-i+1:len1-i+1)) - ichar('0')\n      end do\n\n      bills = 0\n      ! We have digits(1:len1) set, and digits(len1+1)=0, digits(len1+2)=0.\n      do i = 1, len1+1   ! because we need to process the last digit we set (and the extra one at len1+1 might be nonzero from carry)\n          if (digits(i) == 10) then\n              digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n              digits(i) = 0\n          end if\n\n          if (digits(i) < 5) then\n              bills = bills + digits(i)\n          else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n              if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                  digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n              end if\n              bills = bills + 5\n          else  ! digits(i) > 5\n              digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n              bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      min2 = bills\n\n      ! Convert min2 to string\n      allocate(character(len=20) :: s2)\n      write(s2, '(I0)') min2\n      len2 = len_trim(s2)\n\n      ! Third program: \n      ! Step 1: replace \"BC\" by \"D\". Since s2 is digits, we skip? But we do the replacement for correctness? \n      ! We'll create a new string s3 by removing every occurrence of \"BC\". But note: we have to do global replacement? The Java replaceAll replaces every occurrence.\n\n      ! How to do: traverse the string and whenever we see 'B' followed by 'C', we replace by 'D' and skip the next character? But we don't have 'B' or 'C'. So we can just set s3 = s2.\n\n      ! However, to be generic, we do:\n\n      ! We'll create a new string without explicitly replacing? But note: we are going to traverse and count. We can do the replacement in one pass.\n\n      ! Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      s3 = ''\n      i = 1\n      do while (i <= len2)\n          if (i < len2 .and. s2(i:i) == 'B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1)=='C') then\n              s3 = s3 // 'D'\n              i = i + 2\n          else\n              s3 = s3 // s2(i:i)\n              i = i + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      len3 = len_trim(s3)   ! Actually, we built s3 by concatenation, so we know the length? We can use the length of s3.\n\n      ! But note: we allocated s3 as a deferred-length string. We built it by appending. We then use the length of s3.\n\n      ! Now traverse s3 and count:\n      cnt = 0\n      tmp = 0\n      do i = 1, len3\n          ch = s3(i:i)\n          if (ch == 'A') then\n              tmp = tmp + 1\n          else if (ch == 'D') then\n              cnt = cnt + tmp\n          else\n              tmp = 0\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the final result (cnt)\n      write(*,*) cnt\n\n      ! Deallocate arrays? Not necessary as the program ends.\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original code outputs without extra spaces. We use write(*,*) which adds a newline and may add a space? We can use:\n\n      write(*,'(I0)') cnt\n\n  But the original third program outputs a long (cnt). And we want to output exactly the number without any extra space.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we output the same number.\n\n  However, the original chain: the output of the third program is the only output.\n\n  We'll output cnt as an integer (I0 format).\n\n  But note: the third program in the original code outputs a long, and we are using integer(8) for cnt.\n\n  So:\n\n      write(*,'(I0)') cnt\n\n  This writes without any space.\n\n  Let me test with a small example? We don't have the input, but we assume the logic.\n\n  However, the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n  We note: the entire program reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n  We must be cautious: \n      - The first program might have a bug? But we are translating the Java code.\n\n  But note: the first program uses an outer loop labeled \"loop\" and breaks out of the inner two loops. We did with an exit of the outer loop (named outer). That is correct.\n\n  One more thing: in the first program, the outer loop is over i from D-1 down to 0. We did: do i = D-1, 0, -1.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  However, the problem: the first program uses a label \"loop\" and then \"break loop;\". We break the outer loop? Yes, we break the outer loop.\n\n  Let's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n  Note: In the second program, we have an array `digits` that we allocated to len1+2. We must not access beyond len1+2? We set digits(len1+2)=0 and we only access up to i=len1+1 and then digits(i+1) at i=len1+1 is digits(len1+2) which is safe.\n\n  We'll write the code.\n\n  Note: We use integer(4) and integer(8) and the appropriate kinds.\n\n  We define:\n\n      integer, parameter :: i4 = selected_int_kind(9)   ! for integers up to 10^9 (but we use for small integers: D, p, c, etc.)\n      integer, parameter :: i8 = selected_int_kind(18)  ! for large integers\n\n  But for portability, we can use:\n\n      use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: int32, int64\n\n  However, the problem does not specify, but we assume the compiler supports.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      integer(kind=4) and integer(kind=8)\n\n  We'll do that.\n\n  Let me write the entire code.\n\n  Note: The third program might not be efficient if the string is long? But the string is the digits of min2, which is the output of the second program. The second program's input is min1 (at most 1000) and then min2 is the output of the second program. The second program's algorithm is for the number of bills, which is at most the number of digits? Actually, the second program is for a problem of paying with minimal bills and coins. The output min2 is the total number of coins and bills? Actually, the problem says \"bills\" (but it includes coins?).\n\n  We assume the length of the string for min2 is at most 20.\n\n  Therefore, we can safely do the replacement.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  We note: the third program's replacement: we are building a new string s3 from s2. The length of s3 might be the same as s2? Because we are replacing \"BC\" (2 characters) by \"D\" (1 character). But in our case, there are no \"BC\", so s3 = s2.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      s3 = ''   ! start with empty\n      i = 1\n      do while (i <= len2)\n          if (i < len2) then   ! we can look at two characters\n              if (s2(i:i)=='B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1)=='C') then\n                  s3 = s3 // 'D'\n                  i = i+2\n                  cycle\n              end if\n          end if\n          ! If not, then append one character\n          s3 = s3 // s2(i:i)\n          i = i+1\n      end do\n\n  But note: we are building s3 by appending. We don't know the length in advance. We can preallocate s3 to the same length as s2? But the maximum length of s2 is 20. We can set a maximum length for s3? 20 is safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a buffer of the same length? Actually, the replacement can only reduce the length? So we can set:\n\n      allocate(character(len=len2) :: s3_temp)   ! but we don't know the final length? Actually, we are building by concatenation and we don't want to preallocate the length? We can use a deferred-length string and build by concatenation? But that might be inefficient, but 20 is small.\n\n  We'll do as above.\n\n  However, in Fortran, we can do:\n\n      s3 = repeat(' ', len2)   ! allocate to the same length? but we don't know the final length.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do without building a new string? We can traverse the original string and simulate the replacement? But the third program does a replacement first and then a separate traversal.\n\n  We'll build s3 as described.\n\n  Now, the entire code:\n\n  Note: We must be cautious with the indices in the first program: the problem index i (from 0 to D-1) and we store p and c for index i in p(i+1) and c(i+1). The bitmask: we use i from 0 to D-1, and we test the i-th bit? Yes.\n\n  We use the intrinsic `btest` for bit testing.\n\n  Let's code.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer(4) :: D, i, j, k, bitmask, solve_num, INF1\n      integer(8) :: G, score, min1, min2, cnt, bills, tmp\n      integer(4), allocatable :: p(:), c(:)\n      character(len=100) :: input_line   ! for reading, but we don't use\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: s1, s2, s3\n      integer(4) :: len1, len2, len3, i4\n      integer(4), allocatable :: digits(:)\n      character :: ch\n\n      !

But the problem does not require testing.\n\n  We output the code as requested.\n\n  Note: The third program's input is the string representation of min2, which is a number (digits). Therefore, the replacement of \"BC\" does nothing, and then the counting will be 0. So the entire program outputs 0.\n\n  But that is the behavior of the chain: the first program outputs a number, the second program outputs a number, and the third program outputs 0 because the input string is digits.\n\n  Therefore, we are done.\n\n  We write the entire Fortran program."
