But the output of the second program is an integer that we convert to a string. The integer might be 0, 1, 2, ... so the string might be of any length? and the characters are digits. Example: If the integer is 3, the string is \"3\". Then the map: { '3': 1 } -> size=1 -> output \"No\". If the integer is 11, the string is \"11\": map { '1':2 } -> size=1 -> output \"No\".

Then the second program: n=3 -> result2 = (3/3)*2 = 2, then 3%3==0 -> so 2? Then the string \"2\" -> distinct=1, frequencies: 1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\". But the example output of the first program for \"1817181712114\" is 3? Then the second program outputs 2, then the third program outputs \"No\". However, the original first program for \"1817181712114\" outputs 3? Then the chain: \n            Step1: 3\n            Step2: input 3 -> output (3/3)*2 + (3%3==0?0:1) = 2 + 0 = 2.\n            Step3: input \"2\" -> distinct=1, and frequencies: [1] -> not 2 -> \"No\". So the output is \"No\". But we don't have a test for the entire chain? We'll trust the logic. We output the Fortran program as described. Note: We added a check for the 32-bit integer range. If the input causes an overflow, we output an error and stop.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are meant to be run in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (atcoder_ABC164_D) reads a string and outputs a long integer (the answer).\nThe second program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n and outputs an integer: (n / 3) * 2 + (if n mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0).\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string of length 4 and checks if exactly two distinct characters each appear twice, then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut the chain is: \n  Input (string) -> Program1 -> Output (long) \n  Then Program2 takes that long as an integer? But note: Program2 expects an integer from stdin. However, the output of Program1 is a long integer. We must note that the output of Program1 is a number (say, x) which is then used as the input to Program2.\n\nBut Program2: \n  It reads an integer n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); \n  So the output of Program1 is printed as a long, then read by Program2 as a string and parsed to an integer.\n\nThen the output of Program2 is an integer (say, y) which is then used as input to Program3? \nBut Program3: \n  It reads a string of 4 characters. \n\nThis is a problem because the output of Program2 is an integer (e.g., 5) and Program3 expects a string of length 4. \n\nWait, let me look again: the original chain is that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. \n\nHowever, the three programs are independent and are designed for different problems. \n\nBut the instruction says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\nWe must consider the data flow:\n\nInput to the entire chain: the string S (for the first program)\n\nThen:\n  Step1: Run program1 on S, get a long integer L. Print L (this becomes the input to program2).\n  Step2: Run program2 on the string representation of L. The program2 reads an integer, so we must convert the string to an integer. Then it outputs an integer Y = (n/3)*2 + (if n%3!=0 then 1 else 0). Print Y (this becomes the input to program3).\n  Step3: Run program3 on the string representation of Y? But note: program3 expects a string of exactly 4 characters? Actually, the example in program3 is for a 4-character string? But the problem says: \"You are given a string S of length 4\" (from the original problem ABC132_A). However, the output of program2 is an integer which might be 1 digit, 2 digits, etc. It is not necessarily 4.\n\nThis is a mismatch.\n\nBut wait: the original chain might not be designed to work together? The instruction says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". However, the three programs are from different problems and have different input expectations.\n\nTherefore, we must reinterpret the task: we are to write a Fortran program that does the entire chain. The chain is:\n\n  Input: a string (for the first program)\n  Then the first program processes and outputs a long integer.\n  Then the second program takes that long integer (as a string) and converts it to an integer, then computes an integer result and outputs it as an integer (which becomes a string of digits).\n  Then the third program takes that string (which is the string representation of the integer from the second program) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice? But note: the third program expects a string of length 4. However, the output of the second program might not be 4 characters.\n\nThis leads to a problem: the third program might not work as intended if the string length is not 4.\n\nBut the original problem atcoder_ABC132_A states: \"The input is a string of length 4\". So if the output of the second program is not 4 characters, then the third program would behave differently? \n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" for the entire sequence. \n\nBut note: the three programs are independent and are not designed to be chained. Therefore, we must assume that the output of the first program is a number that is then fed as an integer to the second program, and the output of the second program is then treated as a string to the third program? And the third program is designed for a 4-character string? \n\nThis is ambiguous. But the instruction says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\nGiven that the original chain would run:\n\n  java atcoder_ABC164_D   # reads a string from stdin, outputs a number to stdout.\n  java codeforces_669_A   # reads that number from stdin, outputs another number.\n  java atcoder_ABC132_A   # reads that number (as a string) from stdin, then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo the third program is reading a string that is the output of the second program. The length of that string is the number of digits in the output of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the third program must work for any string? But note: the original third program was designed for 4-character strings, but the code itself doesn't enforce the length? It simply counts the frequency of each character. So it will work for any string.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Step1: Read the initial string (like the first program).\n  Step2: Compute the result of the first program (a long integer, but note: the first program uses modulus 2019 and the string of digits, and computes the number of substrings that are divisible by 2019? It actually uses a known digit DP method for divisibility by 2019 in base 10). The result is a count (a long integer).\n\n  Then, we use that long integer as the input to the second program. The second program takes an integer n (so we convert the long to integer? But note: the output of the first program might be large? The first program computes the number of pairs (i, j) such that the substring from i to j (in a certain representation) is divisible by 2019. The maximum value of the count might be up to 200000? So it might be an integer (within 0 to about 200000). So we can convert to integer.\n\n  Step3: The second program: \n        n = [the integer from step2]\n        output = (n / 3) * 2 + (if n mod 3 != 0 then 1 else 0)\n\n  Then, we take the output of the second program (an integer) and convert it to a string. This string is the input to the third program.\n\n  Step4: The third program: \n        Count the frequency of each character in the string. Then check if there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice? Actually, the original program does:\n            - It counts the frequency of each character.\n            - Then it checks: for every character in the map, the frequency must be 2? and the map must have size 2.\n\n        But note: the problem statement for ABC132_A: \"The input is a string of length 4 consisting of two kinds of characters, each appearing exactly twice.\" \n        However, the program does not check the length. It only checks:\n            ok = true\n            for each frequency in the map: if frequency != 2 -> ok = false.\n            then if ok and map.size()==2 -> \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        So if the string has 3 characters? Then we might have one character appearing once and another twice? Then it would fail. Or if the string has 5? \n\n        But the output of the second program is an integer that we convert to a string. The integer might be 0, 1, 2, ... so the string might be of any length? and the characters are digits.\n\n        Example: \n          If the integer is 3, the string is \"3\". Then the map: { '3': 1 } -> size=1 -> output \"No\".\n          If the integer is 11, the string is \"11\": map { '1':2 } -> size=1 -> output \"No\".\n          If the integer is 1122, the string is \"1122\": then we have '1':2, '2':2 -> output \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the integer from the second program: \n          n = (from the first program) an integer in the range [0, ...] (but the first program: the maximum n is the number of substrings? Actually, the program counts pairs (i, j) with i<=j? Actually, the program uses a DP and then counts the pairs of indices that have the same mod value. The maximum value of the count is C(n,2) which for n=200000 is about 20000000000, which is 2e10 -> which is too big for an integer? \n\n        Wait: the first program: \n          long ans = 0L;\n          mod_cnt[0]++;   // so mod_cnt[0] becomes at least 1.\n          for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n            ans += (long)mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2;\n          }\n\n        This is the number of pairs of indices (i, j) (with i < j) such that the mod value at i equals the mod value at j? So the count is at most about (n*(n-1))/2, and n is the length of the string (which is up to 200000). Then the maximum ans is about (200000 * 199999) / 2 = 19999900000, which is about 2e10 -> 20 billion. This is too big for a 32-bit integer (max 2e9) but a 64-bit integer (long in Java) can hold it. \n\n        However, the second program: \n          It reads the integer from stdin: \n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\n\n        But 20 billion is 20000000000, which is more than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). So we will get a NumberFormatException.\n\n        This is a problem: the second program cannot read such a big number as an integer.\n\n        Therefore, we must reconsider: the chain as described might break for large inputs.\n\n        How to resolve?\n\n        The instruction says: \"the entire sequence\". We are to mimic the behavior. But the second program uses an integer. If the output of the first program is too big for an integer, then the second program would crash. So we must design the Fortran program to mimic the same behavior? Or should we use a 64-bit integer in the second program? \n\n        However, the second program is written to use an integer (32 bits). But in Fortran, we can use integers of different kinds.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem says: the entire chain. We are to run the three steps in sequence. We must be faithful to the original chain.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs a long integer (which in Fortran is an integer of kind=8). The second program expects an integer (32-bit). So when converting the long integer to a string and then reading it as an integer in the second program, if the value is too big for 32-bit, the second program would crash. However, in Fortran we can do the same: we can try to read the string as a 32-bit integer? But if the number is too big, we get an overflow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem constraints of the first program: the string S can be up to 200000 characters, but the answer might be huge (20 billion). The second program is not designed for such big numbers.\n\n        This indicates that the chain might be broken for large inputs.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we have two options:\n\n        Option 1: Assume the input to the first program is such that the answer (the long integer) fits in a 32-bit integer. Then the chain works.\n\n        Option 2: Change the second program to use long? But the problem says \"translate the entire sequence\", so we must be faithful.\n\n        Since the instruction says: \"behaves identically\", we must mimic the Java behavior. In Java, if the string of the long integer is too big for an integer, then Integer.parseInt would throw an exception. But in Fortran, we can check the range? Or we can use an integer of the same kind? But the second program uses int.\n\n        However, in Fortran we can use integer(kind=4) for the second program? But the maximum for integer(4) is about 2e9. So if the value from the first program is greater than 2e9, we cannot represent it. Then the second program would have undefined behavior? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the second program does:\n\n          solve(int n) {\n            System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n          }\n\n        But if n is too big for an int, then it will be truncated? But in Java, the conversion from string to int with Integer.parseInt will throw an exception if the value is out of range.\n\n        Therefore, we must mimic: if the value from the first program is within [Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE] then proceed, else the second program would crash? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the input range. But the original first program is designed for a string of up to 200000 digits. The answer (the count) can be as large as 20000000000 (20e9) which is above 2e9 (about 2.147e9). Therefore, for large inputs the second program will crash.\n\n        We are not instructed to fix the chain. We are to translate the entire sequence. So we must write a Fortran program that:\n\n          - Reads a string (the initial input for the first program).\n          - Computes the answer of the first program (a long integer).\n          - Then, if that long integer is within the range of a 32-bit integer, convert it to integer(4) and then compute the second program's result. Otherwise, we must mimic the crash? Or we can note that the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we must crash too? But Fortran doesn't throw exceptions, so we must check and if it's too big, we might output something? But the original second program would crash.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem does not specify how to handle this, and that the chain might be broken, we might have to assume that the input to the first program is such that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the second program is very simple and we can do the arithmetic in 64-bit and then check for overflow? But that changes the behavior.\n\n        Since the problem is ambiguous, I will assume that the output of the first program is within the range of a 32-bit integer. This is because the problem says \"entire sequence\" and it is meant to be executed, so we assume valid input that doesn't break the chain.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          Step1: Read a string (for the first program).\n          Step2: Compute the long integer result of the first program (using the same algorithm, but in Fortran). Store it as a 64-bit integer.\n\n          Step3: Convert the 64-bit integer to a 32-bit integer? But we must check bounds. However, we assume it fits.\n\n          Step4: Compute the second program: \n                  n32 = the 32-bit integer from step3.\n                  result2 = (n32 / 3) * 2 \n                  if (mod(n32, 3) /= 0) then result2 = result2 + 1\n\n          Step5: Convert the integer result2 to a string.\n\n          Step6: For the third program: \n                  Take the string from step5, and:\n                    - Build a frequency map of the characters.\n                    - Check that every character in the map has frequency 2 and the map has size 2.\n\n          Step7: Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n        But note: the third program does not require the string to be of length 4? It will work for any string.\n\n        However, the original third program was designed for a 4-character string. But we are using it on a string of digits of variable length.\n\n        Now, the Fortran program:\n\n          We must write the entire chain in one Fortran program without I/O in the middle.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            - Read the initial string (from stdin) -> only one read at the beginning.\n\n            - Process the first program: \n                  S (the string) -> compute mod_arr and mod_cnt for mod 2019, then compute ans = sum_{i} (mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1))/2, and also note mod_cnt[0] is incremented by one.\n\n            - Then, convert the long integer (ans) to an integer(4) if possible? But we assume it fits. We can do:\n\n                  n32 = int(ans, kind=4)   ! but we must check if ans is within the range of integer(4)\n\n            - However, to be safe and because the problem says \"behaves identically\", if the value is too big we must crash? In Fortran, we can check:\n\n                  if (ans > huge(n32) .or. ans < 0) then \n                      ! note: the count is nonnegative. And the second program uses nonnegative? Actually, the first program's ans is nonnegative.\n                      ! and huge(n32) is 2147483647.\n\n                  But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so if the value is too big, we must not output the same as the chain? The chain would crash in the second program. In Fortran, we can write an error message and stop? But the original chain would throw an exception. We are to output the same as the chain? The chain would not output the final \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we should not output anything? \n\n            Given the ambiguity, and the instruction to output only at the end, we will assume the input is such that the value fits.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note that the original chain might not be defined for large inputs? So we design for the intended use.\n\n          - Then compute the second program: \n                  n = n32\n                  result2 = (n / 3) * 2 \n                  if (mod(n, 3) /= 0) then result2 = result2 + 1\n\n          - Convert result2 to a string. We can write the integer to an internal file (string).\n\n          - Then, for the third program: \n                  Let s3 = the string representation of result2.\n                  Count the frequency of each character in s3.\n                  Check if:\n                      every frequency is 2 and the number of distinct characters is 2.\n\n          - Then output: \n                  if (ok) then \n                      write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n                  else\n                      write(*,*) \"No\"\n                  end if\n\n        Note: the original third program outputs without quotes? In Java, System.out.println(\"Yes\") outputs the string and then a newline. In Fortran, we can write with (*,*) and it will add a space at the beginning? But we can use formatted output.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we output at the end.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            write(*,'(a)') \"Yes\"\n\n        to output without extra spaces.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n          Step1: Read the initial string.\n\n          Step2: First program algorithm:\n\n            Let S be the string of length N.\n            We'll create an array mod_arr of length N (integer, mod 2019) and mod_cnt(0:2018) (initialized to 0).\n\n            We traverse from the last character to the first? Actually, the Java code:\n\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    // take the (N-1-i)-th character\n                    int tmp = (S.charAt(N-1-i) - '0') * radix % 2019;\n                    if (i != 0) \n                        tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n                    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n                    mod_cnt[tmp] = mod_cnt[tmp] + 1;\n                    radix = (radix * 10) % 2019;\n                }\n\n            Then ans = 0\n            mod_cnt[0] = mod_cnt[0] + 1   // because the Java program does mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop.\n            for each i in 0..2018: \n                ans = ans + mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2\n\n            Note: mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 is integer arithmetic? But in Fortran, we use integer division? But the division by 2 must be integer? Yes, because it's a binomial coefficient.\n\n          Step3: Convert ans to a 32-bit integer? But if the value is too big, we might truncate? We'll do:\n\n                n32 = int(ans, kind=4)   ! but we must check bounds.\n\n            However, we assume it fits.\n\n          Step4: Compute result2 = (n32 / 3) * 2 \n                  if (mod(n32, 3) /= 0) then result2 = result2 + 1\n\n          Step5: Convert result2 to a string. We can do:\n\n                character(len=20) :: buffer   ! 20 digits is enough for 32-bit integer (max 10 digits)\n                write(buffer, *) result2\n\n            But this will have leading spaces? We can adjust to remove spaces? Or we can use:\n\n                write(buffer, '(I0)') result2   ! I0 gives the integer without leading spaces.\n\n          Step6: For the string buffer (trimmed?):\n\n                Let s = trim(adjustl(buffer))   ? But the write with I0 should not have leading spaces? Actually, the I0 format writes without spaces.\n\n            Then, we want to count frequency:\n\n                We can use an array for all ASCII characters? But the string is digits? So we can use an array of 0:9? But wait: the string might have a minus sign? The result2 is nonnegative? Because the input to the second program is nonnegative (the count from the first program) and the second program does nonnegative operations. So the string is digits only.\n\n            However, the third program is generic for any character? So we should use a map? But in Fortran, we can use an array for the entire ASCII set? Or we can use a dictionary? But Fortran doesn't have built-in dictionaries. Alternatively, we can sort the string and traverse? Or we can use an array of size 0:255.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                integer :: freq(0:255) = 0   ! for each character, by its ASCII value.\n\n                do i=1, len(s)\n                    ich = iachar(s(i:i))\n                    freq(ich) = freq(ich) + 1\n                end do\n\n            Then, we want to:\n\n                count = 0\n                distinct = 0\n                ok = .true.\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                if (ok .and. distinct==2) then\n                    write(*, '(a)') 'Yes'\n                else\n                    write(*, '(a)') 'No'\n                end if\n\n          However, note: the third program in Java does not break on non-2 frequency? It breaks at the first non-2. We can break early? But we are using an array. We can break the loop? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                distinct = 0\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n            But we don't break? We can break the loop? Actually, we can break the loop only when we set ok to false? But the Java program breaks the loop as soon as it finds one frequency that is not 2.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                distinct = 0\n                ok = .true.\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                            ! but we don't break? we can break? But the Java program breaks the for-loop when it finds one.\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n            We can break the loop? But note: we need to count distinct? So we cannot break? Actually, the Java program breaks the loop immediately when it finds one frequency that is not 2. So we can break? But we are already iterating over all 255? It's cheap.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                ok = .true.\n                distinct = 0\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                            ! break the inner loop? but we need to count distinct? Actually, if we break we won't get the distinct count. \n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n            But the Java program does:\n\n                for (Entry<Character, Integer> c : map.entrySet()) {\n                    if (c.getValue() != 2) {\n                        ok = false;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then after the loop, it checks ok and distinct==2.\n\n            So we don't need the distinct count until the end? So we can break the loop as soon as we find one non-2? But note: we are counting distinct in the same loop. So if we break, we haven't counted the remaining distinct.\n\n            Therefore, we should separate the two: we don't break? Or we can do:\n\n                ok = .true.\n                distinct = 0\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                            exit   ! exit the loop\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n            This is efficient and matches: first we count distinct? But the Java program doesn't count distinct until the end? Actually, the map.entrySet() is iterating over the distinct keys. The Java program does:\n\n                for (Entry<Character, Integer> c : map.entrySet()) {\n                    if (c.getValue() != 2) {\n                        ok = false;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then it checks: if (ok && map.size() == 2)\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                distinct = 0\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                ok = .true.\n                do i=0,255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            ok = .false.\n                            exit\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n            Then: if (ok .and. distinct==2) -> \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        Step7: Output.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java also breaks as soon as it finds one non-2. We do the same.\n\n        However, we have two loops? The Java program does it in one loop? We can do one loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            distinct = 0\n            ok = .true.\n            do i=0,255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    distinct = distinct + 1\n                    if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                        ok = .false.\n                        ! but we cannot break because we need to count distinct? \n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        But then we are not breaking early? The Java program breaks early. So for efficiency, we break? But the string is short (max 10 or 11 digits). So it's acceptable to not break? \n\n        However, we can break the distinct count? We don't need the distinct count until the end? And the Java program breaks the first time it finds a non-2? So we can do:\n\n            distinct = 0\n            ok = .true.\n            do i=0,255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    distinct = distinct + 1\n                    if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                        ok = .false.\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        This does not break early. But we can break? Actually, we cannot break the distinct count? We need to count all distinct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do two passes: first for distinct count? Then for checking frequency? But that is two loops? But the array is 256, so it's fixed.\n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            ok = .true.\n            distinct = 0\n            do i=0,255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    distinct = distinct + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Then check: for every non-zero freq, must be 2? and we break on first non-2.\n            do i=0,255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                        ok = .false.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        This is two loops but the total is 256*2 = 512 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we do two loops.\n\n        But note: the Java program does not count distinct in a separate pass? It counts distinct as the size of the map. We are counting distinct by iterating over the entire ASCII set? That's acceptable.\n\n        Summary:\n\n          Steps in Fortran:\n\n            program main\n              implicit none\n\n              ! ... declarations ...\n\n              !

We'll assume the input is one string without spaces.\n\n              ! But note: the input might be padded? We read with a200000 and then set n = len_trim(S)? \n              ! Actually, the Java program: sc.next() reads the next token. We can assume the input has no spaces? Then we read the entire line? \n\n              ! Alternatively, we can use:\n              !   read(*,*) S   ! this will read one token, but we don't know the length? \n              !   n = len_trim(S)\n\n              ! But we declared S as 200000, so we can do:\n\n              n = index(S, ' ') - 1\n              if (n < 0) then\n                  n = len_trim(S)\n              else\n                  n = n\n              end if\n\n              Actually, we can simply do:\n\n                  n = len_trim(S)\n\n              because if the string is read and there are trailing spaces, we want the non-space part? But the input string might have trailing spaces? The problem says: a string. We assume the input is given without extra spaces? \n\n              Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then take the first non-space token? But the problem says one string. We'll assume one token.\n\n              So:\n\n                  read(*, '(a)') S\n                  n = len_trim(S)\n\n              However, if the input has leading spaces? The Java scanner next() does not include leading spaces? \n\n              We need to trim leading spaces? \n\n                  S = adjustl(S)\n                  n = len_trim(S)\n\n              But the problem: the string might be a number? It is a string of digits. So leading spaces are not allowed? The problem says: the input string.\n\n              We'll do:\n\n                  read(*, '(a)') S\n                  S = trim(adjustl(S))\n                  n = len_trim(S)\n\n              But note: the first program: the string can be up to 200000? So we don't want to remove internal spaces? The problem says: the input is a string. And the Java program reads next token. So we assume the input has no spaces? Then we can read and then set n = len_trim(S) and use S(1:n).\n\n          Step2: First program.\n\n            Initialize:\n              mod_cnt = 0\n              radix = 1\n              mod_arr = 0   ! we'll initialize the array\n\n            Loop i=0 to n-1? In Java: i from 0 to N-1.\n\n            In Fortran, we can do:\n\n              do i=1, n   ! but note: the Java loop: i=0 to n-1, and we take the character at N-1-i.\n\n              Let j = n - i   ! in 1-indexed: the character at position j (if we index from 1 to n) -> the character at position n-i+1? \n\n              Example: n=3, i=0 (in Java) -> j = 3-0-1 = 2? (0-indexed: 0,1,2) -> but the string in Java: S[0], S[1], S[2]. \n              We have S in Fortran: S(1:1) is the first character, S(3:3) is the last.\n\n              The Java loop: \n                  for i=0: \n                      char = S.charAt(N-1-i)   -> the last character? \n\n              So in Fortran: for i=1: \n                  char = S(n-i+1:n-i+1)   -> for i=1: n-1+1 = n -> the last character.\n\n            So:\n\n              do i = 1, n\n                  ! get the digit: from the i-th character from the end? \n                  tmp = iachar(S(n-i+1:n-i+1)) - iachar('0')\n                  tmp = tmp * radix\n                  tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n                  if (i > 1) then\n                      tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n                  end if\n                  mod_arr(i) = tmp\n                  mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                  radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n              end do\n\n            Then:\n\n              mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1   ! because the Java program does mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop.\n\n              ans = 0\n              do i=0,2018\n                  if (mod_cnt(i) > 0) then\n                      ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * int(mod_cnt(i)-1, kind=8) / 2\n                  end if\n              end do\n\n          Step3: Convert ans to n32? But we must check bounds? We assume it fits.\n\n              n32 = int(ans, kind=4)   ! if ans is too big, this is undefined? We assume it fits.\n\n          Step4: Compute result2:\n\n              result2 = (n32 / 3) * 2 \n              if (mod(n32, 3) /= 0) then \n                  result2 = result2 + 1\n              end if\n\n          Step5: Convert result2 to a string:\n\n              write(buffer, '(I0)') result2   ! I0: minimal width\n              s3 = trim(buffer)\n\n          Step6: For the third program:\n\n              ! Initialize frequency array for ASCII 0 to 255\n              freq = 0\n\n              do i=1, len(s3)\n                  ascii_val = iachar(s3(i:i))\n                  freq(ascii_val) = freq(ascii_val) + 1\n              end do\n\n              distinct = 0\n              do i=0,255\n                  if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                      distinct = distinct + 1\n                  end if\n              end do\n\n              ok = .true.\n              do i=0,255\n                  if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                      if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                          ok = .false.\n                          exit\n                      end if\n                  end if\n              end do\n\n              if (ok .and. distinct == 2) then\n                  write(*, '(a)') 'Yes'\n              else\n                  write(*, '(a)') 'No'\n              end if\n\n          End.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java: the string is exactly the digits? And we are using the entire string (without leading zeros? because I0 doesn't write leading zeros). So the string is the standard decimal representation.\n\n        However, the integer result2 is nonnegative, so no minus sign.\n\n        We must be cautious: the first program uses mod 2019 and the radix might be negative? We use mod with positive modulus? Fortran mod gives nonnegative? Actually, we can use:\n\n            tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)   -> but if tmp is negative? We start with nonnegative? \n\n            tmp = (digit) * radix % 2019   -> digit is nonnegative, radix is nonnegative? \n\n            But radix is computed modulo 2019? So nonnegative? \n\n            Then we do: mod(tmp, 2019) -> nonnegative? \n\n            Then we do: if (i>1) then tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019) -> nonnegative? \n\n            So we can use the Fortran mod function? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use modulo with positive modulus? \n\n            But mod(a,b) for a>=0 and b>0 is nonnegative? \n\n            However, if a is negative? We don't have negative. \n\n            But note: radix * 10 might be negative? We start with radix=1 (positive) and then:\n\n                radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n\n            This mod in Fortran: mod(radix*10, 2019) is nonnegative? \n\n            Actually, mod for integers: \n                mod(8,5)=3, mod(13,5)=3, mod(-2,5)= -2? But we want nonnegative? \n\n            In Java, the modulus for positive modulus is nonnegative? \n\n            We can use:\n\n                radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)   -> but if radix*10 is negative? \n\n            How can it be negative? We start with positive and mod with positive modulus? \n\n            But in Fortran, if the product is negative? \n\n            Actually, we are doing:\n\n                radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n\n            But we want the same as Java: nonnegative modulus. \n\n            Java: the modulus operator for positive modulus returns a nonnegative value? \n\n            In Fortran, we can use modulo(radix*10, 2019) to get nonnegative? \n\n            The difference:\n\n                mod(a, b) has the sign of a.\n                modulo(a, b) has the sign of b.\n\n            Since 2019 is positive, modulo(a, 2019) is in [0,2018].\n\n            So we should use:\n\n                radix = modulo(radix * 10, 2019)\n\n            Similarly, for the other mod operations? \n\n            We have:\n\n                tmp = modulo((iachar(S(n-i+1:n-i+1)) - iachar('0')), 2019)   -> no, we multiply by radix first.\n\n                tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019   -> we want nonnegative? \n\n                Then: tmp = modulo(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n            And then:\n\n                if (i>1) then\n                    tmp = modulo(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n                end if\n\n            So we change all mod to modulo to get nonnegative results.\n\n        Let me rewrite the first program loop with modulo:\n\n            do i = 1, n\n                digit = iachar(S(n-i+1:n-i+1)) - iachar('0')\n                tmp = digit * radix\n                tmp = modulo(tmp, 2019)\n                if (i > 1) then\n                    tmp = modulo(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n                end if\n                mod_arr(i) = tmp\n                mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                radix = modulo(radix * 10, 2019)\n            end do\n\n        But note: the modulo function for integers in Fortran: \n\n            modulo( -1, 2019) = 2018? \n\n        However, we are not having negative? Because digit is from 0 to 9, radix is nonnegative? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, we must note: the multiplication digit*radix might be negative? Only if radix is negative? But we start with radix=1 and then update with modulo(radix*10, 2019) which is nonnegative? \n\n        So we can also use mod? But to be safe, we use modulo.\n\n        Now, we write the entire program.\n\n        Important: We must use integer(kind=8) for ans? And for the intermediate in the binomial coefficient: mod_cnt(i) might be up to 200000? Then mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1) is about 4e10? Which fits in 64-bit integer? Yes.\n\n        Let me write:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: temp\n\n          do i=0,2018\n              if (mod_cnt(i) > 0) then\n                  temp = int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8)\n                  ans = ans + temp * (temp-1) / 2\n              end if\n          end do\n\n        But note: the division by 2 is integer division? It must be even? Actually, mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1) is always even? So we can do integer division.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          ans = ans + (temp * (temp-1)) / 2\n\n        Now, we write the code.\n\n        We must be cautious: the array mod_arr: we use indices 1..n, and mod_cnt indices 0..2018.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        Note: We must initialize:\n\n            mod_cnt = 0\n            radix = 1\n            ans = 0\n\n        We'll assume:\n\n            integer :: i, digit, radix, tmp, mod_arr(1:200000), mod_cnt(0:2018)\n\n        But the length of mod_arr is n? We declared 200000? That's fine.\n\n        Now, the entire Fortran program:\n\n        (We assume the input string has no spaces and we read it as a token? But we read with '(a)' and then trim and adjustl? But we'll read and then adjustl and then trim.)\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            read(*, '(a)') S\n            S = adjustl(S)   ! remove leading spaces\n            n = len_trim(S)   ! n is the length\n\n        Then proceed.\n\n        However, note: the string might be longer than 200000? The problem says up to 200000. Our S is declared as 200000. So we are safe.\n\n        But if the input is less than 200000, then the rest of S is filled with spaces? Then when we do n = len_trim(S), we get the actual length. Then we use S(1:n).\n\n        But in the loop: we use S(n-i+1:n-i+1) for i=1 to n: that is the substring of length 1.\n\n        Now, let's code.\n\n        Note: We must use integer for the modulus 2019? We use 2019.\n\n        We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n        Due to the complexity, we break the program into the steps.\n\n        We must be cautious: the array mod_arr: we use mod_arr(i) for i=1..n.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            !

Step6: Third program\n            freq = 0\n            do i = 1, len(s3)\n                j = iachar(s3(i:i))\n                freq(j) = freq(j) + 1\n            end do\n\n            distinct = 0\n            do i = 0, 255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    distinct = distinct + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ok = .true.\n            do i = 0, 255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                        ok = .false.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (ok .and. distinct == 2) then\n                write(*, '(a)') 'Yes'\n            else\n                write(*, '(a)') 'No'\n            end if\n\n            end program combined\n\n        But note: the third program in Java breaks at the first non-2. We do the same.\n\n        However, we must test with a small example? \n\n        Example: \n          Input to the first program: \"1817181712114\" (an example from the problem atcoder_ABC164_D) -> the answer is 3? Then the second program: n=3 -> result2 = (3/3)*2 = 2, then 3%3==0 -> so 2? Then the string \"2\" -> distinct=1, frequencies: 1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\".\n\n        But the example output of the first program for \"1817181712114\" is 3? Then the second program outputs 2, then the third program outputs \"No\".\n\n        However, the original first program for \"1817181712114\" outputs 3? Then the chain: \n            Step1: 3\n            Step2: input 3 -> output (3/3)*2 + (3%3==0?0:1) = 2 + 0 = 2.\n            Step3: input \"2\" -> distinct=1, and frequencies: [1] -> not 2 -> \"No\".\n\n        So the output is \"No\".\n\n        But we don't have a test for the entire chain? \n\n        We'll trust the logic.\n\n        We output the Fortran program as described.\n\n        Note: We added a check for the 32-bit integer range. If the input causes an overflow, we output an error and stop. This mimics the Java chain that would crash? \n\n        But in the problem, we assume it fits? So we hope the input is such that it fits.\n\n        Now, we write the code accordingly."
