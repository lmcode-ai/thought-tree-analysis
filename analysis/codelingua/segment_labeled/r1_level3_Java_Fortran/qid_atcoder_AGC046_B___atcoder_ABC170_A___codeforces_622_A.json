  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The first program (atcoder_AGC046_B) reads four integers (A, B, C, D) and computes a dynamic programming table.\n The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) reads a line of space-separated integers and outputs the position of the first zero (counting from 1) or the count until the first zero? Actually, it breaks at the first zero and outputs the count (which is the index in the array starting at 1).\n The third program (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer (position) and computes an index in a sequence.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is executed in sequence: the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs a single integer (dp[C][D]), which is then the input to the second program? \n The second program expects a line of space-separated integers. However, the first program outputs one integer. \n Then the second program would read that integer and then break at the first zero? But the first program does not output a zero.\n\n Actually, looking at the chain: \n   File1: reads A, B, C, D -> outputs a single integer (dp[C][D])\n   File2: reads a line of integers and then counts until it finds a zero? But the input to File2 is the output of File1, which is one integer. So the input to File2 would be a string that is a single integer (non-zero). Then the second program would break at the first token (which is non-zero) and then output 1? Because it breaks when it finds a zero? Actually, it breaks when the token is \"0\". Since the token is not \"0\", it would count all tokens? Actually, no: it breaks in the loop when it finds a zero and then stops. But the loop iterates over each token. In this case, there is only one token (the integer from the first program). So it increments result (to 1) and then checks: if that token is \"0\", then break. Since it is not, the loop continues? But there is only one token. Then the loop would end. So it would output 1? \n\n However, the second program does not break the loop until it finds a zero. And if it never finds a zero, then it will count all tokens. So if the input is \"123\", then the array has one token, result becomes 1 and then the loop ends (because there are no more tokens). Then it prints 1.\n\n But the third program: it expects a long integer. The second program outputs 1? Then the third program would read 1 and compute the sequence.\n\n However, the problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n But the second program outputs a single integer (the count until the first zero, but if no zero then the total count of tokens? Actually, the program breaks when it finds a zero and then breaks the loop. In the absence of a zero, it just counts all tokens. So the output is the number of tokens until the first zero, or if none, the total number of tokens? But the input to the second program is a single token (a non-zero integer). So the output of the second program is 1? Then the third program would get 1.\n\n But note: the original chain might not be intended to be connected by the actual values. We must simulate the entire chain.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n But the first program reads four integers and outputs one integer. The second program reads a line of integers (which in the chain will be one integer) and outputs one integer (the count until the first zero? but if there's no zero then the total token count). The third program reads one long integer and outputs one integer.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n   Step 1: Read four integers (A, B, C, D) from standard input (like the first program).\n   Step 2: Compute the dp table as in the first program and get the result (dp[C][D]).\n   Step 3: Use that result as the input to the second program. But note: the second program expects a line of tokens. However, we only have one integer. So we treat that integer as a string? Actually, we don't need to split because there is only one token. The second program counts the tokens until it finds a zero. Since we have one token (a string representation of an integer) and it does not contain a space, the token is the entire string. Then we check if that token is \"0\". If it is, we break and output 1 (the count). Otherwise, we count that token (so we get 1) and then the loop ends? Actually, the Java program does:\n\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n\n   So if the token is not \"0\", then we set result to 1 and then the loop ends (because there is only one token). So the output of the second program is 1? \n\n   But wait: what if the integer from the first program is zero? Then the token is \"0\", so we break and output 1 (the count at that point). So in both cases the output is 1? \n\n   However, what if the first program outputs zero? Then the second program would break at the first token (which is \"0\") and output 1. If the first program outputs a non-zero, then the second program would output the total number of tokens? which is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the second program always outputs 1? because the input to the second program is a single token (whether it's zero or non-zero). \n\n   Then the third program will always get the integer 1? \n\n   But that cannot be: because the first program computes a non-zero value (unless A==C and B==D, then dp[C][D]=1? but then the second program would output 1, and the third program would compute for position=1.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must simulate the chain.\n\n   But note: the second program does not output the value of the token, it outputs the count of tokens until the first zero (and then breaks). And if the first token is zero, it breaks immediately and outputs 1. If the first token is non-zero, then it counts that token (so 1) and then moves to the next token (but there isn't one) so it ends and outputs 1.\n\n   Therefore, the output of the second program is always 1? \n\n   However, what if the input to the second program is a string with multiple tokens? But in the chain, the output of the first program is one integer. So the input to the second program is a string of one token. Therefore, the output of the second program is always 1.\n\n   Then the third program gets 1 and computes:\n\n        position = 1\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position: \n            ... for nrstSeqStartIndx=1: getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (1*2/2) = 1+1=2 -> 2>=1 -> break the while condition fails.\n        then while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position: \n            nrstSeqStartIndx+1 = 2 -> getValueAtIndex(2)=2, which is >1 -> so skip.\n        then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1) = 1 + (0) = 1.\n        then output: (position - startIndex) + 1 = (1-1)+1 = 1.\n\n   So the entire chain: for any input (A,B,C,D) the final output is 1? \n\n   This does not make sense. \n\n   Let me reexamine the chain: \n\n   The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n   But the second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) is actually intended to read five integers? The problem in atcoder ABC170 A is: \n        \"There are five variables in the equation. Print the position of the variable that is 0.\"\n\n   The sample input: \"0 2 3 4 5\" -> output 1; \"1 2 0 4 5\" -> output 3.\n\n   But the program we have for atcoder_ABC170_A does:\n\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n\n   This will break at the first occurrence of \"0\". And then output the count (which is the index in the array starting at 1).\n\n   However, the input to the second program is the output of the first program (a single integer). So the input line has one token. \n\n   Therefore, the second program will output 1 if the token is not \"0\", but if the token is \"0\", then it also outputs 1? because it breaks at the first token (which is zero) and then result is 1.\n\n   So regardless of the value of the first program's output, the second program outputs 1.\n\n   Then the third program always gets 1 and outputs 1.\n\n   This is clearly not the intended behavior of the original programs if run independently? \n\n   But note: the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" of these three programs. \n\n   However, the original programs are independent and were not designed to be chained. But the problem states that they are executed in sequence with the output of the first as the input to the second, and the output of the second as the input to the third.\n\n   Therefore, we must write a Fortran program that:\n\n      Reads four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\n      Computes the value of dp[C][D] as in the first program.\n\n      Then, because the second program would read a line of tokens and output the index of the first zero (or the count of tokens until the first zero, and then break) and we have one token (the string of dp[C][D]), we have to simulate:\n\n          token = string representation of dp[C][D]\n          We then check: is token \"0\"? \n          If yes, then the second program would output 1 (because it breaks at the first token which is the first zero).\n          If not, then the second program would output the count of tokens (which is 1) because there are no more tokens.\n\n          Therefore, the output of the second program is always 1.\n\n      Then the third program gets the integer 1 and computes:\n\n          position = 1\n          Then the third program's output is 1.\n\n   So the entire Fortran program would output 1 for any input? \n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a zero? Then the second program would break at the first token and output 1? So the third program still gets 1.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is always 1.\n\n   However, this seems too trivial. There might be a misunderstanding.\n\n   Let me look again at the second program: \n\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n\n   The loop iterates over each token. It increments result by 1 for each token until it hits a zero. Then it breaks.\n\n   In our chain, the input to the second program is the string of one token (which is the integer from the first program). \n\n   Therefore, the second program's output is:\n\n        If the token is \"0\", then the loop breaks after the first token and returns 1.\n        If the token is not \"0\", then the loop runs for the one token and result becomes 1 and then the loop ends.\n\n   So always 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the second program entirely? because it always produces 1.\n\n   Then the third program always gets 1 and produces 1.\n\n   So the entire Fortran program:\n\n        Read A, B, C, D\n        Compute dp[C][D] (with MOD 998244353) but then we don't use it? because we know the second program will output 1.\n\n        Then we set the input to the third program as 1.\n\n        Then compute the third program with input 1 -> output 1.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a negative number? The MOD operations ensure nonnegative. So the token is always a nonnegative integer? and if it is zero, we still get 1 from the second program.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is always 1.\n\n   However, we must simulate the chain exactly. We are not allowed to optimize away the first program even though we know the second and third are constant? \n\n   But note: the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the first program outputs a very large number, the second program would output 1 (because there is only one token) and then the third outputs 1.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        Step 1: Read A, B, C, D.\n        Step 2: Compute dp[C][D] (with the DP from the first program) and store it in a variable, say, res1.\n        Step 3: We then know that the second program would output 1, so we set res2 = 1.\n        Step 4: Then we run the third program with position = res2 (which is 1) and compute the result (which is 1) and output it.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". And the intermediate steps should process without I/O.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        Read A, B, C, D.\n\n        Then compute the entire DP for the first program (without printing anything).\n\n        Then we simulate the second program: since we know that the input to the second program is a single token (the string of res1) and the second program will output 1, we set the intermediate result to 1.\n\n        Then we run the third program with input 1 and output the result (which is 1).\n\n   But note: the third program (codeforces_622_A) has a method getValueAtIndex that computes 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\n   And the algorithm:\n\n        long position = 1;\n        long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        }\n        // For position=1: getValueAtIndex(2)= 1+(2-1)*2/2 = 1+1 = 2 -> 2>=1 -> skip.\n\n        Then: while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) \n            // getValueAtIndex(2)=2, which is >1 -> skip.\n\n        Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx) = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n        Then output: (1-1)+1 = 1.\n\n   So we can hardcode the third program to output 1? \n\n   But the problem says: the entire sequence. We must simulate the third program for the input 1.\n\n   However, we can compute the third program for the input 1 without any loops? because the while conditions are not met.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! For the first program\n        integer, parameter :: MOD = 998244353\n        integer :: A, B, C, D\n        integer(8) :: c_index, d_index   ! We need to use long indices? The problem in Java uses int for indices, but Fortran integers are usually 4 bytes. But the numbers can be up to 3000? so integer(4) is enough for indices, but the dp values can be large (mod 998244353) so we use integer(8) for dp to avoid overflow? Actually, we do mod arithmetic.\n\n        ! We are going to compute dp from A to C (rows) and B to D (columns)\n        integer(8), dimension(0:3000, 0:3000) :: dp   ! 0-indexed to 3000\n\n        !

Otherwise, compute ans\n                dp(c_index, d_index) = 0\n                if (c_index > A) then\n                    dp(c_index, d_index) = dp(c_index, d_index) + dp(c_index-1, d_index) * d_index\n                end if\n                if (d_index > B) then\n                    dp(c_index, d_index) = dp(c_index, d_index) + dp(c_index, d_index-1) * c_index\n                end if\n                if (c_index > A .and. d_index > B) then\n                    dp(c_index, d_index) = dp(c_index, d_index) - dp(c_index-1, d_index-1) * (c_index-1) * (d_index-1)\n                end if\n                ! Take mod\n                dp(c_index, d_index) = mod(dp(c_index, d_index), MOD)\n                if (dp(c_index, d_index) < 0) then\n                    dp(c_index, d_index) = dp(c_index, d_index) + MOD\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, the first program would have printed dp(C, D). We store it as res1, but we don't use it for the second program's output? \n        ! Actually, we don't need to store res1? because the second program always outputs 1? \n        ! But note: we are simulating the chain. The second program reads the output of the first program. However, the second program's output is always 1 regardless of the first program's output.\n\n        res2 = 1   ! because the second program always outputs 1\n\n        ! Step 3: Run the third program with position = res2 (which is 1)\n        position = res2\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n        ! The function getValueAtIndex: \n        !   f(n) = 1 + (n-1)*n/2\n\n        ! First while: \n        do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) < position)\n            nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n        end do\n\n        ! Second while: \n        do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position)\n            nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n        end do\n\n        startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n        res3 = (position - startIndex) + 1\n\n        !

For position=1, we have:\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1 -> then getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2 -> 2>=1 -> condition fails -> break.\n\n   Then the second while: \n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1 -> then getValueAtIndex(2) = 2, which is >1 -> condition fails.\n\n   So we don't enter either loop.\n\n   Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a very large number? We are storing it in an integer(8) in the first program? Actually, we are not storing it at all for the second program because we know the second program outputs 1. \n\n   However, what if the first program outputs a string that has multiple tokens? But the first program outputs the integer as a single token. So the second program sees one token. Therefore, the second program's output is always 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the entire second program.\n\n   But note: what if the first program outputs a negative number? The mod operation in the first program ensures nonnegative. So the token is nonnegative? and if it is zero, we still get 1.\n\n   So the program is as above.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n   We are not actually using the value of the first program's output for anything except to know that the second program outputs 1. \n\n   Therefore, we can skip the entire first program? No, because the first program's output might be used in the second program to determine the token? But we are not using it to compute the second program's output? We are just setting the second program's output to 1.\n\n   But what if the first program outputs a string that contains spaces? It doesn't: it outputs a single integer. \n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program above is correct.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses a dp array of size 3001x3001. We allocated 0:3000 -> 3001 in each dimension.\n\n   And the loops go from A to C and B to D. We assume A, B, C, D are in the range [0,3000]? The problem does not specify, but the array is 3001. We assume the input values are within [0,3000]. \n\n   Also note: the first program uses long (64-bit) for dp. We use integer(8) for dp.\n\n   Let me test with a small input: \n        A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1 -> dp[1][1]=1.\n        Then the second program outputs 1, and the third outputs 1.\n\n   But what if we have a non-trivial input? \n        A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2.\n\n        dp[1][1]=1.\n        For (1,2): \n            c=1, d=2: \n                c==1 (which is A) but d>B -> ans = dp[1][1] * 1 = 1.\n                dp[1][2] = 1 mod mod = 1.\n        For (2,1): \n            similarly: 1\n        For (2,2):\n            ans = \n                from above: dp[1][2] * 2 = 2\n                from left: dp[2][1] * 2 = 2\n                subtract: dp[1][1] * 1 * 1 = 1\n                so 2+2-1 = 3.\n            dp[2][2]=3.\n\n        Then the first program outputs 3.\n\n        The second program: gets the token \"3\", which is not zero -> outputs 1.\n\n        The third program: gets 1 -> outputs 1.\n\n   So the final output is 1.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program as above.\n\n   However, note: the first program might output a string that is the integer without any spaces? and the second program splits by space? so one token.\n\n   Therefore, the program is:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        !

Now, we have dp(C, D). But we don't use it for the next step because the second program outputs 1.\n\n        position = res2   ! which is 1\n\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n        !

But the formula is the same as in Java: integer division truncates toward zero. But note: (n-1)*n is always even? because either n or n-1 is even. So the division is exact.\n\n   Also note: the first while loop might run many times? but the value at index n grows as O(n^2). For position=1, the first while loop does not run. For larger positions? but in our chain, position is always 1.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   However, what if in the future the first program outputs zero? Then the second program would output 1? and the third program would get 1. So the chain is the same.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above Fortran program.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\" and we read A, B, C, D at the beginning.\n\n   And \"Only the last block should handle producing output\": we write the result of the third program at the end.\n\n   Intermediate steps: we compute the first program and then set res2=1 and then the third program without any I/O.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are including the first program's computation even though we know the second program ignores its output? But that's what the chain does: the first program runs and outputs a number, then the second program runs and outputs 1, then the third runs and outputs 1.\n\n   We are simulating the entire chain.\n\n   Therefore, the code below is the answer."
