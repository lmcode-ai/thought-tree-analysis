But note: the original Java program:\n\n            for i in [0, n-1]:\n                if s[i]=='0'\n                    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n                    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n                    then: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M\n                else\n                    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n                    then: \n                         dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M\n                         dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M\n\n        Actually, in the else part, note: the first assignment sets dp[i+1][1] and then the next two are additions to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]? But in the Java code:\n\n            else {\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;   // this sets dp[i+1][1] to a value\n                // then:\n                dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;   // so we are adding to dp[i+1][0] which was not set? This is a bug? In Java, uninitialized elements are 0? But in the dp array, we have:\n\n            int [][] dp = new int[n+1][2];   // which initializes to 0. So in the else part:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] is initially 0, then we add (dp[i][0]*2) % M.\n\n            dp[i+1][1] is set to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M, then we add (dp[i][1]*2) % M.\n\n        So:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M = (dp[i][0] + 3*dp[i][1]) % M But that doesn't look like the known problem. Alternatively, the known solution for \"Sum Equals Xor\" is 3^k where k is the number of free bits? I think the intended DP for the problem is:\n\n          dp[i][0] = number of ways for the prefix i such that the sum is strictly less than the prefix of L (the binary string) so far? \n          dp[i][1] = number of ways such that the sum is equal to the prefix of L.\n\n        And the transitions:\n\n          For a bit 0:\n            If we choose 0 for the next bit: then the state remains tight? because 0 equals the bit. If we choose 1: then the sum would exceed? so not allowed in state1. But the given code does:\n\n            if s[i]=='0':\n                tight: \n                    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]   # because we must choose 0 to remain tight? and then the state remains tight. non-tight:\n                    we can choose 0 or 1? but the problem allows (a,b) such that a+b = a xor b? which means no carry? so the bits must be (0,0) or (0,1) or (1,0). Actually, the known solution: \n                dp[i][0] = state for not tight, dp[i][1] = state for tight. For a bit '0' in L at position i:\n                  tight: we can only choose (0,0) -> then next state is tight? non-tight: we can choose (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) -> 3 ways? but also we have to account for the constraint? The known solution: \n                if tight: \n                    if L[i]=='0':\n                        then only (0,0) is allowed -> then next state tight: \n                        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] \n                    else: # L[i]=='1'\n                        then (0,0) would make the sum 0 which is less -> then state becomes non-tight, and (0,1) or (1,0) would be tight? \n                        dp[i+1][1] = 2 * dp[i][1]   ? dp[i+1][0] = ... ? This is complicated. Given the time, I will stick to the given Java code for the third program. We'll do:\n\n          Let n = len(bin_str)\n          dp(0,0) = 1   -> meaning at the start, we have one way and we are in state 0? (the Java code has state0 and state1, but what do they represent?) The Java code:\n\n          for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if s[i]=='0'\n                dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n                dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n                then: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M   --> so it adds twice the state1 of the previous step to state1 of the next?\n            else\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n                then: \n                    dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n                    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n        This is not standard. But we'll code it as is. We'll use:\n\n          dp(0,0) = 1\n          dp(0,1) = 0   ? In the Java code, they initialized an array of zeros. So at step0, state0=1, state1=0. Then for each character in the binary string:\n\n          if the character is '0':\n\n             dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n             dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n             then: dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1)   --> so total state1: 3 * dp(i,1) ?\n\n          else: (character is '1')\n\n             dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,0) + dp(i,1)\n             then: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0)\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1) So:\n\n          For '0': \n             state0_next = dp(i,0)\n             state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1) For '1':\n             state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n             state1_next = dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1) = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n\n        Then set:\n\n             dp(i+1,0) = state0_next mod M\n             dp(i+1,1) = state1_next mod M\n\n        Then the result is (dp(n,0)+dp(n,1)) mod M.\n\n   We'll code accordingly. Summary of the entire Fortran program:\n\n     Steps:\n\n       1. Read n, a, b.\n       2. Read list1 (a integers) and list2 (b integers). 3. Create an array res1 of n integers: do i=1, n\n                 if (i is in list1) then\n                     res1(i) = 1\n                 else\n                     res1(i) = 2\n                 end if\n             end do\n\n       4. x = res1(1) [the first element]\n\n       5. Compute count for the second program: count = 0\n            current = 0\n            do while (current /= 360)\n                current = current + x\n                if (current > 360) then\n                    current = current - 360\n                end if\n                count = count + 1\n            end do\n\n       6. Convert count to a binary string. 7. Run the DP for the third program on that binary string.\n\n       8. Print the result of the DP. We assume that the input n>=1. Let's code accordingly. Note: We must use modules for dynamic strings? Or we can use fixed-length strings for the binary representation (max 20 digits?). We'll use:\n\n        integer :: count, current, x\n        character(100) :: bin_str   ! we'll build it by hand, then we know the length. Implementation:\n\n        We'll write the program in Fortran. Note: The first program reads list1 and list2. We must store them. We'll read a and then read a integers for list1. Then read b and then read b integers for list2.",

But in Fortran, we have initialized dp to 0? But in our code, we set:\n\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod(2 * dp(i,0), M) This is equivalent to: \n\n            dp[i+1][0] = 0 + 2 * dp[i][0]   (mod M) And then for state1: we set initially to (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) and then add 2 * dp[i][1] -> so total: dp[i][0] + 3 * dp[i][1]\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (c == '0') then\n                state0_next = dp(i,0)\n                state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1)\n            else\n                state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n                state1_next = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n            end if\n\n        Then:\n\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod(state0_next, M)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod(state1_next, M) But note: the Java code in the '0' case does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] + 2 * dp[i][1] = 3 * dp[i][1]\n\n        So the above is equivalent. We can rewrite the loop as:\n\n          do i=0, len_bin-1\n             c = bin_str(i+1:i+1)   ! because the string starts at index 1\n\n             if (c == '0') then\n                 state0_next = dp(i,0) state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1)\n             else\n                 state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n                 state1_next = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n             end if\n             dp(i+1,0) = mod(state0_next, M)\n             dp(i+1,1) = mod(state1_next, M)\n          end do\n\n   This is cleaner. Let me update the code accordingly. Final code: [See below]\n\n   Note: We assume the input sizes are small. However, note: the first program's list1 and list2: we are storing the integers. And we are using a double loop for checking membership (n up to 100, a up to 100) -> 100*100=10000, acceptable. Let's run with an example: \n\n        Example input for the first program: \n            n=3, a=1, b=1, list1 = [1], list2 = [2]\n\n        Then res1 = [1, 2, 2]   (since for i=1: in list1 -> 1; i=2: in list2? but we only check list1 -> so if not in list1 then 2. We don't check list2? because the first program: \n            if (list1.contains(i+1)) -> 1; else 2. So x = res1(1) = 1. Then the second program: \n            x=1: \n                current=0 -> 1 -> 1 (count=1) current=1 -> 2 (count=2) ... until 360 steps? Actually, we do 360 steps: \n                count_val = 360\n\n        Then convert 360 to binary: \n            360 in binary: 101101000 -> 9 bits. Then run the DP on \"101101000\"\n\n        We don't know the expected result, but the program should run. We output the result of the DP. We'll write the code accordingly. Note: The third program's DP for the string \"101101000\" is computed. This is the best we can do given the ambiguity. Let's code accordingly.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first Java program (codeforces_421_A) reads n, a, b, then two lists of integers (of size a and b).\n    Then it outputs a sequence of n integers (each being 1 or 2) based on membership in the first list.\n\n 2. The second Java program (atcoder_AGC046_A) reads an integer x and then computes the smallest positive integer count \n    such that after adding x repeatedly (and taking modulo 360 by subtracting 360 if over 360) we get 360.\n\n 3. The third Java program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a binary string and then computes a dynamic programming result modulo M.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is a sequence of n integers (each 1 or 2) and the second program expects a single integer.\n\n How to chain?\n - The first program produces n numbers (each 1 or 2). But the second program expects one integer? This is a mismatch.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n But the first program outputs multiple integers (n of them) and the second program expects one integer? \n\n How should we interpret the chain?\n\n After reading the problem again: \n \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \n \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we have to design the entire data flow.\n\n However, the three programs are independent and have different inputs and outputs. \n\n Let me see the intended flow:\n\n Original chain: \n   Input for the first program: n, a, b, then a integers for list1 and b integers for list2.\n   Output of first program: n integers (each 1 or 2) in one line? Actually, it prints each number with a space.\n\n   Then the second program: reads one integer? But the first program output is n integers. \n\n   And the third program: reads a string.\n\n This does not seem to chain naturally.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Therefore, we must consider:\n\n   Step 1: The first program reads from standard input and produces output (n integers) which is then the input to the second program.\n\n   Step 2: The second program reads from standard input (which now is the output of the first program). But the second program expects one integer? \n\n   Step 3: The third program reads the output of the second program? which is one integer? but the third program expects a binary string.\n\n This mismatch suggests that we must reinterpret the chain.\n\n However, the problem states: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n But the original chain is three separate programs. We are to combine them so that the entire program:\n\n   - Reads the input for the first program (n, a, b, then list1 and list2) from standard input.\n   - Then passes the output of the first program (which is a sequence of n integers) as input to the second program? But the second program expects a single integer.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might intend that the entire program reads the same input that the first program reads, then internally processes through the three steps, and then outputs what the last program outputs.\n\n However, the chain is:\n\n   Input1 -> Program1 -> Output1 (which becomes Input2) -> Program2 -> Output2 (which becomes Input3) -> Program3 -> Output3.\n\n But the types:\n\n   Program1: Input: n, a, b, list1 (a numbers), list2 (b numbers). Output: n numbers (each 1 or 2) in one line? Actually, each printed with a space.\n\n   Program2: Input: one integer (x). Output: one integer (count).\n\n   Program3: Input: a string (binary digits). \n\n How can we chain Program1's output to Program2? Program1 outputs n numbers, but Program2 expects one number? \n\n We have two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The chain is not as written? Maybe we are to run the three programs independently on the same initial input? But that doesn't match the description.\n\n   Possibility 2: We are to run the first program and then use its entire output as the input for the second program? But the second program only reads one integer. So it would take the first integer of the first program's output? Then what happens to the rest?\n\n   Possibility 3: The problem might be misstated. But note: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n After reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Therefore, the output of the first program (a sequence of integers) must be the input to the second program. But the second program only reads one integer. \n\n This implies that the second program would only read the first integer of the sequence and leave the rest for the third program? \n\n But the third program expects a string.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me look at the programs individually:\n\n   Program1: It outputs n integers (each either 1 or 2) separated by spaces. So the output is a line of n integers.\n\n   Program2: It reads one integer (x) from standard input.\n\n   Program3: It reads one line (a string of binary digits).\n\n So the chain would break because the second program only consumes the first integer of the first program's output, and the third program would then get the rest of the tokens? But the rest of the tokens are integers and the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's.\n\n This does not work.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire output of the first program is treated as the input to the second program? But the second program only uses the first token. Then the third program would get the next tokens? But the third program expects a string.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n After re-thinking: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". We are to mimic the behavior of running the three programs in sequence, with the output of the first becoming the input of the second, and then the output of the second becoming the input of the third.\n\n But the output of the first program is a sequence of n integers (each 1 or 2) on one line. The second program then reads one integer from standard input. So if we chain:\n\n   $ java Program1 < input.txt | java Program2 | java Program3\n\n Then Program2 would only get the first integer from Program1's output? But Program1 outputs n integers on one line. The FastReader of Program2 uses tokenization. So it would read the first token (the first integer) and then the rest of the output would be available for the next tokens? But Program2 only reads one integer and then produces one integer (which it prints). Then Program3 would read the entire output of Program2 (one integer) as a string? But that integer might be more than one digit? Then the string would be that integer? But the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's.\n\n This chain does not make sense.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the three programs are not meant to be chained in this manner. Or there is a misunderstanding.\n\n However, the problem states: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, I will assume that the intended chain is:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program and use its entire output (the n integers) as the input for the second program? But the second program only needs one integer. \n\n   Step 2: Then the second program outputs one integer, which is then the input for the third program? But the third program expects a binary string.\n\n This does not work.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the three programs are independent and the entire program should run all three on the same initial input? But the problem says \"sequence\" and \"output of each is input to the next\".\n\n I see no way to chain them as given.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will design the Fortran program as follows:\n\n   We are to read the input for the first program (n, a, b, list1, list2) and then:\n\n   Step 1: Process the first program to produce an array of n integers (each 1 or 2). But then what?\n\n   Step 2: The second program: we are to take the output of the first program as the input for the second. But the second program expects one integer. \n\n   How about: we take the first integer from the array produced by the first program? But the array contains 1's and 2's. Then the second program would get either 1 or 2? Then it would compute the count for that x (either 1 or 2). \n\n   Step 3: Then the third program would take the output of the second program (an integer, say k) and then treat k as a string? But the third program expects a binary string.\n\n This does not match.\n\n Another possibility: the entire output of the first program (the string of n integers) is fed as a string to the third program? But the third program expects a string of '0' and '1' and here we have a string of '1' and '2'. \n\n This also does not work.\n\n After careful thought, I notice that the three programs are from different problems (codeforces, atcoder). They are not designed to be chained. \n\n Therefore, I suspect the problem is actually to run the three programs independently on the same input? But the problem says \"sequence\" and \"output of each is input to the next\".\n\n I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n Given the time, I will assume the following:\n\n   The problem intended that the entire input for the chain is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first program is passed as input to the second program, and the output of the second program is passed as input to the third program.\n\n   But to make it work, we must reinterpret the second and third programs to take the output of the previous program appropriately.\n\n   Specifically:\n\n      The first program outputs n integers (each 1 or 2). We must then aggregate these n integers to form a single string? But the second program expects an integer. So we can take the first integer? \n\n      However, that would lose information.\n\n   Alternatively, we might take the entire output string of the first program (without spaces) as a binary string? But the digits are 1 and 2, not 0 and 1.\n\n   Then we could map 1->0 and 2->1? But the problem doesn't say.\n\n   Or we might interpret the n integers as digits of a base-3 number? But that is not indicated.\n\n   I think the problem is flawed.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will do the following:\n\n   I will combine the three programs into one Fortran program that reads the input for the first program, then runs the first program's logic, then uses the entire array of n integers (the output of the first program) as the input for the second program? But how?\n\n   The second program expects one integer. So I will arbitrarily choose the first element of the array as the input for the second program.\n\n   Then the third program will take the output integer of the second program and convert it to a binary string? But the third program expects a string of 0s and 1s. \n\n   However, the third program's logic is for a binary string. If we give it a binary representation of the integer from the second program, that might work? \n\n   But note: the third program is from atcoder_ABC129_E and it counts the number of ways to split the binary string? It's a DP for a specific problem.\n\n   Alternatively, we might convert the integer to a binary string and then feed that to the third program.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, a, b, list1, list2 (as the first program).\n      Step 2: Create an array `arr` of n integers: for i=1..n, if i is in list1 then 1 else 2.\n      Step 3: Take the first element of `arr` as `x` for the second program? But what if the array is empty? Then we cannot. \n\n      Step 4: If the array is non-empty, let x0 = arr(1). Then run the second program with x = x0? But x0 is either 1 or 2. Then we compute the count for that x.\n\n      Step 5: Convert the count (an integer) to a binary string? Then feed that to the third program.\n\n      Step 6: Run the third program's DP on that binary string.\n\n   Then output the result of the third program.\n\n   But note: the original first program outputs n integers. We are not outputting that. The problem says only the last block should output.\n\n   However, the chain is:\n\n        Input1 -> Step1 (output: arr) -> Step2 (input: first element of arr) -> Step2 computes count -> Step3 (input: binary representation of count) -> Step3 computes result -> Output.\n\n   This is arbitrary but meets the requirement of chaining.\n\n   But is it what the problem intended? We cannot be sure.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire output of the first program (the string of n integers) is used as the input string for the third program? But then the second program is skipped? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Given the instructions, I will proceed with the arbitrary choice: the second program uses the first integer from the first program's output array.\n\n   Steps in Fortran:\n\n     1. Read n, a, b.\n     2. Read a integers for list1.\n     3. Read b integers for list2.\n     4. Create an array `res1` of size n: for each i from 1 to n, set:\n          res1(i) = 1 if i is in list1, else 2.\n\n     5. Let x = res1(1)   [the first element]\n     6. Compute the count for the second program:\n\n          count = 0\n          current = 0\n          do while (current /= 360)\n             current = current + x\n             if (current > 360) then\n                 current = current - 360\n             end if\n             count = count + 1\n          end do\n\n     7. Now, convert the integer `count` to a binary string? But note: the third program expects a string of characters '0' and '1'. We can write `count` in binary without any separators.\n\n        How to convert an integer to a binary string in Fortran? We can write a conversion function.\n\n     8. Then run the DP of the third program on that binary string.\n\n     9. Output the result of the DP.\n\n   But note: the third program uses modulo 1000000007.\n\n   However, the third program's logic:\n\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for each char in the string:\n          if char == '0'\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n            then: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n          else: // char=='1'\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n            then: \n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n        Then result = (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M\n\n   Actually, let me reexamine the third program:\n\n        It has two states: state 0 and state 1.\n\n        For s[i]=='0':\n            Without the next part: \n                dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n                dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n            Then it adds: \n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M   --> so state1 gets multiplied by 2? and added to state1 of next.\n\n        But wait, the code:\n\n            if (s[i] == '0') {\n                dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n                dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n                // Then:\n                dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n                dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n            } else {\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n                // Then:\n                dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n                dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n                dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n                dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n            }\n\n        This doesn't match the known problems? \n\n        Actually, the known problem ABC129 E is \"Sum Equals Xor\", and the solution is known to be 3^(number of zeros) but with a DP.\n\n        I think there's a simpler solution, but we'll implement as given.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        Let M = 1000000007\n        Let s = binary string representation of the integer `count` (without leading zeros? but we want all the digits? yes, because the DP goes digit by digit)\n\n        However, note: the binary representation of `count` does not have any '0' and '1'? Yes.\n\n        But the conversion: we must represent `count` in base-2, and then form a string of the binary digits.\n\n        Example: if count=5, then the binary string is \"101\"\n\n        Then run the DP.\n\n   But note: the DP in the third program has two states. \n\n   However, the third program in the given code uses a 2D DP array of dimensions [n+1][2] for the string of length n.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        n = len_trim(binary_str)   [but we have to form the binary string and then get its length]\n\n        But note: the third program expects the string to be in an array of characters.\n\n   Implementation in Fortran:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial integers (n, a, b) and the two lists.\n\n        Step 2: Build the array of n elements: for i=1 to n, check if i is in list1 -> mark as 1, else 2.\n\n        Step 3: x = the first element of that array (if n>=1, else we need to handle n=0? but the problem says n, a, b, so n>=1 probably)\n\n        Step 4: Compute the count for the second program.\n\n        Step 5: Convert the count to a binary string.\n\n        Step 6: Run the DP on that binary string.\n\n        Step 7: Print the result.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and only the last block outputs.\n\n   We are only reading at the beginning and printing at the end.\n\n   But note: the first program originally outputs n integers. We are not outputting them. We are using only the first one for the chain. This is arbitrary, but we have to make a decision.\n\n   Since the problem is ambiguous, this is the best we can do.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Steps for converting an integer to a binary string in Fortran:\n\n        We can write a function that repeatedly divides by 2 and builds the string.\n\n        Example:\n\n          integer :: count, i\n          character(:), allocatable :: bin_str\n          integer, parameter :: max_bits = 100  ! since 360*? the count is at most 360? actually: the second program: count = 360 / gcd(tmp, 360). \n          character(max_bits) :: temp  ! we'll build backwards\n\n          Actually, the maximum value of count: \n            The second program: \n               x = either 1 or 2? then:\n                 if x=1: count=360\n                 if x=2: count=180\n\n          So the binary representation of 360 is about 9 bits, 180 is 8 bits.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          if count==0 then\n             bin_str = \"0\"\n          else\n             i = max_bits\n             temp = \"\"\n             num = count\n             do while (num > 0)\n                 remainder = mod(num, 2)\n                 if (remainder==0) then\n                     temp(i:i) = '0'\n                 else\n                     temp(i:i) = '1'\n                 end if\n                 num = num / 2\n                 i = i-1\n             end do\n             bin_str = trim(temp(i+1:max_bits))\n          end if\n\n        But note: the above is for fixed length. Alternatively, we can use an adjustable string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can count the number of bits.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n          integer :: num_bits\n          num_bits = floor(log(real(count))/log(2.0)) + 1\n          allocate(character(len=num_bits) :: bin_str)\n\n        But we don't know the exact length without converting? So we can do:\n\n          We'll use a temporary array of characters of sufficient length (say 32 bits).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        character(32) :: bin_str_temp\n        write(bin_str_temp, '(B32)') count   ! but this will write with leading spaces and without leading zeros? \n        bin_str = trim(adjustl(bin_str_temp))\n\n        But note: the format 'B0' would write without leading zeros? Actually, we can use:\n\n        However, the internal write will give a string of 32 characters including leading spaces? Then we adjust left and trim.\n\n        But we want the exact binary digits.\n\n        Example: write with format '(B0)' is available in Fortran 95? Actually, we can use:\n\n          write(bin_str_temp, '(B0)') count   ! B0 means minimum width\n\n        But this is not standard? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          bin_str = \"\"\n          do while (count > 0)\n             if (mod(count,2)==0) then\n                 bin_str = '0' // bin_str\n             else\n                 bin_str = '1' // bin_str\n             end if\n             count = count / 2\n          end do\n\n        But note: we need to preserve the value of count for the DP? We have already computed count. We are going to convert it to a string.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          num = count\n          bin_str = \"\"\n          if (num==0) then\n             bin_str = \"0\"\n          else\n             do while (num > 0)\n                 if (mod(num,2)==0) then\n                     bin_str = '0' // bin_str\n                 else\n                     bin_str = '1' // bin_str\n                 end if\n                 num = num / 2\n             end do\n          end if\n\n   Then we have the string bin_str.\n\n   Then we run the DP:\n\n        M = 1000000007\n        n = len(bin_str)\n        dp(0,0) = 1   -> but Fortran indexing: we can do from 1 to n\n\n        We'll use a 2D array dp(0:n, 0:1)   -> 0-indexed for the state and 0-indexed for the position.\n\n        But note: the original Java program:\n\n            for i in [0, n-1]:\n                if s[i]=='0'\n                    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n                    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n                    then: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M\n                else\n                    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n                    then: \n                         dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M\n                         dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M\n\n        Actually, in the else part, note: the first assignment sets dp[i+1][1] and then the next two are additions to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]? \n\n        But in the Java code:\n\n            else {\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;   // this sets dp[i+1][1] to a value\n                // then:\n                dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;   // so we are adding to dp[i+1][0] which was not set? \n\n        This is a bug? In Java, uninitialized elements are 0? But in the dp array, we have:\n\n            int[][] dp = new int[n+1][2];   // which initializes to 0.\n\n        So in the else part:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] is initially 0, then we add (dp[i][0]*2) % M.\n\n            dp[i+1][1] is set to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M, then we add (dp[i][1]*2) % M.\n\n        So:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M = (dp[i][0] + 3*dp[i][1]) % M\n\n        But that doesn't look like the known problem.\n\n        Alternatively, the known solution for \"Sum Equals Xor\" is 3^k where k is the number of free bits? \n\n        I think the intended DP for the problem is:\n\n          dp[i][0] = number of ways for the prefix i such that the sum is strictly less than the prefix of L (the binary string) so far? \n          dp[i][1] = number of ways such that the sum is equal to the prefix of L.\n\n        And the transitions:\n\n          For a bit 0:\n            If we choose 0 for the next bit: then the state remains tight? because 0 equals the bit.\n            If we choose 1: then the sum would exceed? so not allowed in state1.\n\n          But the given code does:\n\n            if s[i]=='0':\n                tight: \n                    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]   # because we must choose 0 to remain tight? and then the state remains tight.\n                non-tight:\n                    we can choose 0 or 1? but the problem allows (a,b) such that a+b = a xor b? which means no carry? so the bits must be (0,0) or (0,1) or (1,0). \n\n            Actually, the known solution: \n                dp[i][0] = state for not tight, dp[i][1] = state for tight.\n\n                For a bit '0' in L at position i:\n                  tight: we can only choose (0,0) -> then next state is tight? \n                  non-tight: we can choose (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) -> 3 ways? but also we have to account for the constraint? \n\n            The known solution: \n                if tight: \n                    if L[i]=='0':\n                        then only (0,0) is allowed -> then next state tight: \n                        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] \n                    else: # L[i]=='1'\n                        then (0,0) would make the sum 0 which is less -> then state becomes non-tight, and (0,1) or (1,0) would be tight? \n                        dp[i+1][1] = 2 * dp[i][1]   ? \n                        dp[i+1][0] = ... ?\n\n            This is complicated.\n\n        Given the time, I will stick to the given Java code for the third program.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          Let n = len(bin_str)\n          dp(0,0) = 1   -> meaning at the start, we have one way and we are in state 0? (the Java code has state0 and state1, but what do they represent?)\n\n        The Java code:\n\n          for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if s[i]=='0'\n                dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n                dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n                then: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M   --> so it adds twice the state1 of the previous step to state1 of the next?\n            else\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n                then: \n                    dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n                    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n        This is not standard. But we'll code it as is.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          dp(0,0) = 1\n          dp(0,1) = 0   ? In the Java code, they initialized an array of zeros. So at step0, state0=1, state1=0.\n\n        Then for each character in the binary string:\n\n          if the character is '0':\n\n             dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n             dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n             then: dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1)   --> so total state1: 3 * dp(i,1) ?\n\n          else: (character is '1')\n\n             dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,0) + dp(i,1)\n             then: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0)\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1)\n\n        So:\n\n          For '0': \n             state0_next = dp(i,0)\n             state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1)\n\n          For '1':\n             state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n             state1_next = dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1) = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n\n        Then set:\n\n             dp(i+1,0) = state0_next mod M\n             dp(i+1,1) = state1_next mod M\n\n        Then the result is (dp(n,0)+dp(n,1)) mod M.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Summary of the entire Fortran program:\n\n     Steps:\n\n       1. Read n, a, b.\n       2. Read list1 (a integers) and list2 (b integers).\n       3. Create an array res1 of n integers: \n             do i=1, n\n                 if (i is in list1) then\n                     res1(i) = 1\n                 else\n                     res1(i) = 2\n                 end if\n             end do\n\n       4. x = res1(1)   [the first element]\n\n       5. Compute count for the second program:\n\n            count = 0\n            current = 0\n            do while (current /= 360)\n                current = current + x\n                if (current > 360) then\n                    current = current - 360\n                end if\n                count = count + 1\n            end do\n\n       6. Convert count to a binary string.\n\n       7. Run the DP for the third program on that binary string.\n\n       8. Print the result of the DP.\n\n   We assume that the input n>=1.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must use modules for dynamic strings? Or we can use fixed-length strings for the binary representation (max 20 digits?).\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer :: count, current, x\n        character(100) :: bin_str   ! we'll build it by hand, then we know the length.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll write the program in Fortran.\n\n   Note: The first program reads list1 and list2. We must store them.\n\n        We'll read a and then read a integers for list1.\n        Then read b and then read b integers for list2.\n\n   We'll assume:\n\n        integer, dimension(100) :: list1, list2   ! but the problem says a, b up to n, and n up to 100? the first program doesn't specify, but let's assume max 100.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n\n          !

Read list1 (a integers)\n          do i=1, a\n             read(*,*) list1(i)\n          end do\n\n          ! Read list2 (b integers)\n          do i=1, b\n             read(*,*) list2(i)\n          end do\n\n          ! Build res1: for i from 1 to n, check if i is in list1\n          do i=1, n\n             res1(i) = 2   ! default to 2\n             do j=1, a\n                if (list1(j) == i) then\n                   res1(i) = 1\n                   exit\n                end if\n             end do\n             ! If we didn't find in list1, we leave as 2. Also, we don't need to check list2 because if it's in list1 we set to 1, else 2.\n          end do\n\n          ! Step 4: x = res1(1)\n          x = res1(1)\n\n          ! Step 5: Compute count_val\n          count_val = 0\n          current_val = 0\n          do while (current_val /= 360)\n             current_val = current_val + x\n             if (current_val > 360) then\n                 current_val = current_val - 360\n             end if\n             count_val = count_val + 1\n          end do\n\n          ! Step 6: Convert count_val to a binary string\n          if (count_val == 0) then\n             bin_str = \"0\"\n             len_bin = 1\n          else\n             num = count_val\n             bin_str = \"\"\n             do while (num > 0)\n                 remainder = mod(num, 2)\n                 if (remainder == 0) then\n                     bin_str = '0' // bin_str\n                 else\n                     bin_str = '1' // bin_str\n                 end if\n                 num = num / 2\n             end do\n             len_bin = len_trim(bin_str)\n          end if\n\n          ! Step 7: Run the DP for the third program\n          ! Initialize dp\n          dp(0,0) = 1\n          dp(0,1) = 0\n\n          do i=0, len_bin-1\n             c = bin_str(i+1:i+1)   ! because the string starts at index 1\n\n             if (c == '0') then\n                 ! First part: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n                 ! Then add: \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M)\n             else\n                 ! First part: \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)\n                 ! Then add: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = mod(2 * dp(i,0), M)   ! because initially 0? \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M)\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Result: \n          write(*,*) mod(dp(len_bin,0) + dp(len_bin,1), M)\n\n          deallocate(res1)\n\n        end program combined\n\n   But note: in the else part, the Java code does:\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + 2 * dp[i][0]) % M\n\n        However, in the Java code, dp[i+1][0] was not set before the addition? But in Fortran, we have initialized dp to 0? \n\n        But in our code, we set:\n\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod(2 * dp(i,0), M)\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n\n            dp[i+1][0] = 0 + 2 * dp[i][0]   (mod M)\n\n        And then for state1: we set initially to (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) and then add 2 * dp[i][1] -> so total: dp[i][0] + 3 * dp[i][1]\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (c == '0') then\n                state0_next = dp(i,0)\n                state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1)\n            else\n                state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n                state1_next = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n            end if\n\n        Then:\n\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod(state0_next, M)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod(state1_next, M)\n\n        But note: the Java code in the '0' case does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] + 2 * dp[i][1] = 3 * dp[i][1]\n\n        So the above is equivalent.\n\n   We can rewrite the loop as:\n\n          do i=0, len_bin-1\n             c = bin_str(i+1:i+1)   ! because the string starts at index 1\n\n             if (c == '0') then\n                 state0_next = dp(i,0)\n                 state1_next = 3 * dp(i,1)\n             else\n                 state0_next = 2 * dp(i,0)\n                 state1_next = dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n             end if\n             dp(i+1,0) = mod(state0_next, M)\n             dp(i+1,1) = mod(state1_next, M)\n          end do\n\n   This is cleaner.\n\n   Let me update the code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        [See below]\n\n   Note: We assume the input sizes are small.\n\n   However, note: the first program's list1 and list2: we are storing the integers. And we are using a double loop for checking membership (n up to 100, a up to 100) -> 100*100=10000, acceptable.\n\n   Let's run with an example: \n\n        Example input for the first program: \n            n=3, a=1, b=1, list1 = [1], list2 = [2]\n\n        Then res1 = [1, 2, 2]   (since for i=1: in list1 -> 1; i=2: in list2? but we only check list1 -> so if not in list1 then 2. We don't check list2? because the first program: \n            if (list1.contains(i+1)) -> 1; else 2.\n\n        So x = res1(1) = 1.\n\n        Then the second program: \n            x=1: \n                current=0 -> 1 -> 1 (count=1)\n                current=1 -> 2 (count=2) ... until 360 steps? \n            Actually, we do 360 steps: \n                count_val = 360\n\n        Then convert 360 to binary: \n            360 in binary: 101101000 -> 9 bits.\n\n        Then run the DP on \"101101000\"\n\n        We don't know the expected result, but the program should run.\n\n   We output the result of the DP.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: The third program's DP for the string \"101101000\" is computed.\n\n   This is the best we can do given the ambiguity.\n\n   Let's code accordingly."
