Actually, when we add back, we break the chain? This method is known as \"disjoint set\" for next available. Steps:\n\n                    Initialize an array `next_avail` of size 0 to n (we can go to n, so set next_avail[n] = n, meaning no available beyond n-1?). For i in 0..n-1: next_avail[i] = i.\n\n                    next_avail[n] = n  (as sentinel) For a query [l, r, win]:\n                         i = l\n                         while i <= r:\n                              i = find(i)   // returns the next available index >= i\n                              if i > r: break\n                              set answer[i] = win\n                              next_avail[i] = find(i+1)   // remove i by pointing to the next available after i\n                              i = next_avail[i]   // then we jump to the next available Then we set answer[win-1] = 0 and we add win-1 back? But note: win-1 might be already removed? and we are adding it back. To add win-1 back: \n                             We set next_avail[win-1] = win-1   // but note: we might have to update the chain? Actually, we are using union-find so when we do find(win-1) we will get win-1? However, if there is a chain: ... -> win-1 -> ... and we set next_avail[win-1] = win-1, then when we do find(win-1) we get win-1. But if the next_avail of win-1 was previously set to something else (because it was removed) then we break the chain? Actually, we want to mark win-1 as available again. So we set next_avail[win-1] = win-1. Then the chain that previously skipped win-1 might still point to a value beyond? But we don't update the previous links? We don't need to? Because when we do find(i) for i<=win-1, we will eventually get to win-1? Example: Initially: [0,1,2,3] -> next_avail: [0,1,2,3,4]\n                            Remove 1: \n                                 set next_avail[1] = find(2) = 2\n                            Then remove 2: \n                                 set next_avail[2] = find(3)=3 Then we add 1 back: set next_avail[1]=1. Now, if we start at 0: \n                                 find(0)=0 -> then remove 0: set next_avail[0]=find(1)=1 -> because we set next_avail[1]=1? Then we start at 1: find(1)=1 -> available.

We read l, r, win_orig\n                    l = l - 1\n                    r = r - 1\n                    win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    Then we do the segment with assignment: answer(curr) = win_orig\n\n                    Then at the end: set answer(win_index) = 0 and then add win_index back to the available set? But wait: we already have the available set implemented with next_avail. How do we add win_index back? We set next_avail(win_index) = win_index   // because we are adding it back. However, note: win_index might be outside the current segment? and we are not traversing it? It might have been removed in a previous query? and now we are adding it back. So the code for the query:\n\n                    read *, l, r, win_orig\n                    l = l - 1\n                    r = r - 1\n                    win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    i = l\n                    do while (i <= r)\n                         curr = find(next_avail, i, n)   ! returns the next available index >= i\n                         if (curr > r) exit\n                         answer(curr) = win_orig\n\n                         ! remove curr: set next_avail[curr] = find(next_avail, curr+1, n)\n                         next_avail(curr) = find(next_avail, curr+1, n)\n\n                         ! update i to skip to the next available after curr: i = next_avail(curr)   ! but note: next_avail(curr) is the next available starting at curr+1? so we can set i = curr+1? \n                         ! Actually, we can set i = curr+1? because the next available might be beyond? but we are in a loop that starts at i. Alternatively, we can set i = next_avail(curr) and then the loop condition checks. end do\n\n                    ! Then set the winner index: \n                    answer(win_index) = 0\n                    ! Add win_index back: \n                    next_avail(win_index) = win_index   ! this marks it as available? but note: if there was a chain that pointed beyond win_index, we break it? However, we are using path compression: the find function will still work? Example: Initially: [0,1,2,3] -> next_avail = [0,1,2,3,4]\n                         We remove 0: set next_avail[0]=find(1)=1 -> so next_avail[0]=1. Then remove 1: set next_avail[1]=find(2)=2. Then we add 1 back: set next_avail[1]=1. Then if we do find(0): \n                             find(0): next_avail[0]=1 -> then find(1): next_avail[1]=1 -> so returns 1. This is correct. But note: when we add back, we do not update the pointers that might point to win_index? For example, if we have next_avail[0] = 2 (because 1 was removed) and then we add 1 back, then next_avail[0] is still 2? So we skip 1? We need to update the chain? Actually, the find function uses recursion and path compression. So when we set next_avail[1]=1, then if we call find(0):\n\n                    find(0): \n                         next_avail[0] = 2 -> then we call find(2) -> which returns 2? but then we set next_avail[0]=2? and return 2. But we want find(0) to return 1 now? How can we fix? The union-find style for next available is usually for the next available starting at i. When we remove an index, we set next_avail[i]=find(i+1). When we add an index i back, we have to update the next_avail of the indices that point beyond i? Alternatively, we can avoid the path compression? The original method without path compression: \n\n                     function find(i):\n                         if next_avail[i] == i then \n                             return i\n                         else \n                             return find(next_avail[i]) But then we don't update the path? Without path compression, the set next_avail[1]=1 doesn't help for find(0) because next_avail[0] is still 2. We need path compression? But then we update the pointers?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the first program (codeforces_356_A) reads integers `n` and `q`, then processes `q` queries. It maintains a TreeSet `left` of indices that haven't been assigned a winner yet. For each query [l, r, win], it removes all indices in [l, r] from `left` and sets `answer[curr] = win` for each such index. Then it sets `answer[win-1]` to 0 and adds `win-1` back to `left`. Finally, it prints the `answer` array.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) reads a line of space separated integers and then finds the first occurrence of \"0\" and outputs its index (1-indexed). However, note that in the chain the input to this program is the output of the first program. But the first program outputs an array of integers (each element is either 0 or the winner index) without spaces? Actually, the first program does:\n        ans.append(answer[i] + \"\");\n    which appends the string of the integer without space. So the output is a string of digits (without spaces). For example, if the answer array is [0,2,0], then it outputs \"020\".\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Then prints \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n However, note: the chain is such that the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program, and then the output of the second program becomes the input of the third program.\n\n But wait: the second program expects a line of space separated integers? Actually, it splits the input line by space. But the first program outputs a string without spaces. So the second program will see one token? Then it will split and get an array of one element? Then the for-loop will break at the first token if that token is \"0\", otherwise it will count the tokens until it finds a \"0\". However, the input to the second program is a string of digits without spaces. So the entire string is one token. Then the second program does:\n\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        -> input_array will be an array of one element: the entire string.\n\n        Then it iterates over each string in input_array (only one string) and:\n            result = 0\n            for each string (only one) it does:\n                result += 1 -> becomes 1\n                then if the string is \"0\", break -> but the string is the entire output of the first program (e.g., \"020\"), which is not \"0\". So it doesn't break.\n\n        Then it outputs 1.\n\n 4. Then the third program gets the output of the second program as input? Actually, the chain is:\n\n        Input for the first program: the original input (n and q, then the queries)\n        Output of first program: a string of digits (without spaces) of length n.\n        This becomes the input to the second program.\n\n        The second program outputs \"1\" (because it counts one token and doesn't break?).\n\n        Then the third program gets the string \"1\" as input? \n\n But wait, the second program outputs the number of tokens until it finds a \"0\", but in this case it never finds a \"0\" in the tokens? Actually, the tokens are the entire string. So if the entire string is \"0\", then the second program will output 1 (and break). Otherwise, it will output the total number of tokens? Actually, the for-loop:\n\n        for each token:\n            result = current count (starting at 0, then we add one for the first token) -> becomes 1\n            if token equals \"0\", break -> then we break and output 1.\n\n        But if the token is not \"0\", then we just have one token? Then we output 1.\n\n        So regardless of what the first program outputs (as long as it's one token without any zeros in the tokens? but note: the token is the entire string) we output 1? Unless the entire string is \"0\", then we break and output 1 as well.\n\n        Actually, the break condition is: if we find a token that is \"0\", then we break and output the current result (which is the count of tokens we have processed, which is 1 in the first token). So the second program always outputs 1.\n\n 5. Then the third program gets the string \"1\". It checks the string \"1\": \n        It has one character? \n        Then the map: \n            character '1' -> count=1.\n        Then we check: we require each character to appear twice? and exactly two distinct characters? \n        Here: only one distinct character and it appears once -> so it prints \"No\".\n\n However, this does not seem to be the intended chain? But we are just translating the chain.\n\n But note: the original chain of programs is independent and we are supposed to run them in sequence. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So:\n\n        Step 1: Run the first program with the original input (from standard input) and capture its output.\n        Step 2: Run the second program with the output of step 1 as its input and capture its output.\n        Step 3: Run the third program with the output of step 2 as its input.\n\n We are to combine into one Fortran program that does the same without intermediate I/O.\n\n How?\n\n We break down:\n\n  The first program:\n      Reads: n, q, and then q lines each with l, r, win (each one is an integer, and we subtract 1 from l, r, win? actually win is subtracted one when stored: answer[win-1]=0 and left.add(win-1))\n\n      We note: the first program's output is a string of n digits (each digit is the corresponding element of the answer array).\n\n  The second program:\n      Input: a string (without spaces) of n digits? Then it splits by space -> one token. Then it counts tokens until it finds a \"0\". Since the token is the entire string, it will break only if the entire string is \"0\". But note: the entire string is the output of the first program. How often is that? \n\n      Actually, the first program's output: \n          The answer array: initially all zeros? But then we set some indices to `win` (which is an integer) and then set the winner index to zero? \n\n      However, note: we set `answer[win-1] = 0` and then add `win-1` back to the set. So the winner index is set to zero. But other indices in the segment [l, r] (except the winner) are set to `win`. So the output string will contain zeros and the winner numbers (which are integers, but note: the winner number is given in the input and can be any integer? but the output is the string of the integer without spaces. However, the winner number might be more than one digit? \n\n      The problem: the first program uses `ans.append(answer[i] + \"\");` so it converts the integer to string. If the winner number is, say, 10, then the output for an index set by that winner would be \"10\". But then the entire output string would have multiple digits per element? and no spaces? \n\n      However, the original problem context (codeforces 356 A) is about knights: n and m (queries) and the winner for each knight is either 0 or the knight that beat it. The constraints: n,m up to 300000. But the numbers in the answer array can be as large as n? which is 300000 -> so each element might be a number with up to 6 digits. \n\n      Therefore, the output of the first program is a string of n numbers (each number is an integer) without any separation. For example, if n=3 and we have two queries: \n          [1,3,2] -> then we set indices 0,1,2 to 2? then we set index 1 (win-1=2-1=1) to 0? and add index 1 back? so the array becomes [2,0,2]. Then output: \"202\"\n\n      But wait: what if we have a winner number of 10? then we set the element to 10 -> so the element would be printed as \"10\", and the output for two adjacent elements would be ... without space? so \"010\" would be the output for an array [0,10]? but that would be \"010\", which is ambiguous.\n\n      Actually, the Java program appends the string of the integer for each element. So the output is the concatenation of the string representation of each element in the array. There are no spaces. \n\n      Example: \n          array: [0, 10, 0] -> output \"0100\"\n\n      Then the second program reads \"0100\", splits by space -> one token: \"0100\". Then it iterates over tokens: \n          token1 = \"0100\"\n          result = 1 (because we count the first token) and then check if the token is \"0\"? -> \"0100\" != \"0\", so no break.\n          Then output 1.\n\n      So the second program always outputs 1? \n\n  The third program then gets \"1\" and outputs \"No\".\n\n But note: if the first program's output string has multiple tokens? Only if we output spaces? But we don't. So the second program always outputs 1.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n      Input: the original input (n, q, and then q queries) for the first program.\n      Output: \"No\"\n\n However, that is not the same as running the chain independently? Because the second program's output is always 1? and the third program outputs \"No\" for \"1\". \n\n But wait: what if the first program's output string is \"0\" (if n=1 and the only knight is beaten and then set to zero? Then the first program outputs \"0\". Then the second program:\n\n        token = \"0\"\n        count the token: result becomes 1, then check: \"0\".equals(\"0\") -> true -> break -> output 1.\n\n      So still 1.\n\n What if the first program outputs a string that has a space? It never does.\n\n Therefore, we can simulate the entire chain without actually simulating the first program? because the second program always outputs 1 and the third program always outputs \"No\". \n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs a string that is exactly \"0\"? Then the second program breaks and outputs 1. So regardless, the second program outputs 1.\n\n And the third program: input is \"1\", which is a string of one character. Then:\n\n        It counts frequency: one character '1' -> frequency 1.\n        Then checks: two distinct characters? no. each character must appear twice? no -> output \"No\".\n\n So the entire chain always outputs \"No\".\n\n However, that cannot be the case? Because the first program does a lot of work and the output of the first program might be long, but the second program always outputs 1 and the third always outputs \"No\". \n\n But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if we run the chain, we always get \"No\". Therefore, the Fortran program can be:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          ! We skip the first program's computation because it doesn't affect the final output? \n          ! But wait: the first program might crash? or the input might be invalid? but we have to read the input for the first program.\n\n          ! Actually, we must read the same input as the first program, because the first program reads from stdin. Then we must simulate the first program to produce the string that the second program would read? but then the second program always outputs 1, and the third always outputs \"No\". \n\n          ! However, the first program might have side effects? None. And we don't care about the intermediate string? because the second program's output is always 1? \n\n          ! But note: the first program might be heavy? but we are to combine the entire sequence. We must run the first program's logic to be faithful? Actually, we don't need to produce the intermediate string if we know the second program always outputs 1 and the third always outputs \"No\". However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The behavior of the chain is: \n                read the input for the first program (n, q, and the queries) -> then output \"No\".\n\n          However, the chain might take a long time if n and q are large? So we must simulate the first program's computation? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not say we can skip steps. We must do the same computations.\n\n          Therefore, we must:\n\n            Step 1: Simulate the first program: read n, q, and the queries, and compute the answer array as a string? but note: we don't actually need the string for the second program's output? because the second program always outputs 1. But we do need to compute the entire first program? because the problem says \"behaves identically\". The chain might have side effects? None. But the first program's computation time? We must simulate the same complexity? \n\n          However, the first program uses a TreeSet and removes elements. The complexity is O(q log n). We must do that in Fortran? \n\n          But note: the second and third programs are independent of the first program's output? because the second program always outputs 1 and the third always outputs \"No\". So we can skip the first program? \n\n          But wait: what if the first program crashes for invalid input? Then we must crash too? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So we must read the same input and do the same operations? even if the intermediate outputs are not used? \n\n          However, the second program's output is always 1, and the third program's output is always \"No\", regardless of the first program's output. So we can skip the heavy computation? \n\n          But the problem does not say we can optimize. We are to translate the entire sequence.\n\n          Therefore, we must:\n\n            - Read the input (n, q, and the q queries) as the first program does.\n            - Simulate the first program's logic (with the TreeSet and the answer array) but we don't need to build the string? because we know the second program will ignore it? However, the problem says \"without I/O\" in the middle. But we are allowed to do the computation? \n\n          However, the first program produces a string that is the output. The second program then reads that string and outputs 1. The third program then reads 1 and outputs \"No\". \n\n          So in the combined Fortran program:\n\n            - We read the input for the first program.\n            - We run the first program's logic (with the TreeSet) and compute the answer array? but we don't need to convert the array to a string? because we don't need to output it? \n\n          But note: the second program's output is always 1, so we don't need the intermediate string. However, the first program must run to completion? because it might have an effect on the state? But the state is only the answer array and the set? and we don't use them? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must do the same computations? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            - We run the first program's logic (with the TreeSet) and then we know that the second program's output is 1 and the third program's output is \"No\". \n\n          Therefore, the combined program:\n\n            program combined\n              implicit none\n\n              ! We need to read the input for the first program: n, q, and then q queries (each: l, r, win)\n\n              ! Then we simulate the first program: we need a sorted set to represent the available indices? We can use a linked list? or a tree? But Fortran doesn't have built-in TreeSet. We can use a boolean array to mark available? but removal and ceiling might be expensive? \n\n              However, the first program does:\n\n                  TreeSet<Integer> left = new TreeSet<>();\n                  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) left.add(i);\n\n                  for each query: \n                    l, r, win (adjusted to 0-indexed)\n                    while (there exists an index in left that is >= l and <= r) {\n                         curr = the smallest such index\n                         answer[curr] = win\n                         remove curr from left\n                    }\n                    then set answer[win-1] = 0 and add win-1 back to left.\n\n              We can simulate with a sorted set? We can use a linked list? But the TreeSet operations are logarithmic. We can use a balanced BST in Fortran? Not standard. Alternatively, we can use a skip list? But that's complex.\n\n              Alternatively, note: the operations are:\n\n                  ceiling(l): the smallest element >= l in the set.\n\n                  remove an element.\n\n              We can use a segment tree? or a Fenwick tree? Actually, we don't need to update and query arbitrarily? We are doing:\n\n                  while (there is an element in [l, r] in the set) {\n                      take the smallest one and remove it.\n                  }\n\n              We can use a union-find? or a linked list with next pointers? \n\n              Another idea: we can use a parent array for next available? \n\n              We can maintain an array `next` that for each index points to the next available index. But we also need to quickly jump to the next available index >= l.\n\n              We can use a disjoint set union that points to the next available? \n\n              We'll maintain an array `next_avail` that for each index i, points to the next available index >= i. Initially, next_avail[i] = i. When we remove an index i, we set next_avail[i] = next_avail[i+1]? But then we can have a path compression.\n\n              Algorithm:\n\n                  next_avail: array of integers, size 0..n-1, initially next_avail[i] = i.\n\n                  Then for a query [l, r, win]:\n                    i = l\n                    while i <= r:\n                         i = next_avail(i)   -> if i is beyond r, break? \n                         if i > r: break\n                         then set answer[i] = win\n                         then remove i: set next_avail[i] = next_avail[i+1]? but we want to jump to the next available index.\n\n                    Then set answer[win-1] = 0, and we have to add win-1 back. But note: we removed win-1 at some point? Actually, we set answer[win-1] to 0 and then add win-1 back to the set. So we need to mark win-1 as available again? \n\n                  How to add back? We set next_avail[win-1] = win-1? But then if win-1 was removed, we have to update the links. We also need to update the links of the previous available indices? \n\n                  Actually, we can do:\n\n                    We maintain an array `next` that for each index i, points to the next available index that is >= i. We can update when we remove an index by setting the next_avail of the previous available index to skip the removed index? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can use a union-find style:\n\n                    function find(i): \n                         if next_avail[i] == i then return i\n                         else next_avail[i] = find(next_avail[i]); return next_avail[i]\n\n                  But when we remove an index i, we set next_avail[i] = find(i+1)\n\n                  And when we add an index i back, we set next_avail[i] = i, and then we also have to update the next_avail of the previous indices? Actually, when we add back, we break the chain? \n\n                  This method is known as \"disjoint set\" for next available.\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    Initialize an array `next_avail` of size 0 to n (we can go to n, so set next_avail[n] = n, meaning no available beyond n-1?).\n\n                    For i in 0..n-1: next_avail[i] = i.\n\n                    next_avail[n] = n  (as sentinel)\n\n                    For a query [l, r, win]:\n                         i = l\n                         while i <= r:\n                              i = find(i)   // returns the next available index >= i\n                              if i > r: break\n                              set answer[i] = win\n                              next_avail[i] = find(i+1)   // remove i by pointing to the next available after i\n                              i = next_avail[i]   // then we jump to the next available\n\n                         Then we set answer[win-1] = 0 and we add win-1 back? But note: win-1 might be already removed? and we are adding it back.\n\n                         To add win-1 back: \n                             We set next_avail[win-1] = win-1   // but note: we might have to update the chain? Actually, we are using union-find so when we do find(win-1) we will get win-1? \n\n                         However, if there is a chain: ... -> win-1 -> ... and we set next_avail[win-1] = win-1, then when we do find(win-1) we get win-1. But if the next_avail of win-1 was previously set to something else (because it was removed) then we break the chain? \n\n                         Actually, we want to mark win-1 as available again. So we set next_avail[win-1] = win-1. Then the chain that previously skipped win-1 might still point to a value beyond? But we don't update the previous links? \n\n                         We don't need to? Because when we do find(i) for i<=win-1, we will eventually get to win-1? \n\n                         Example: \n                            Initially: [0,1,2,3] -> next_avail: [0,1,2,3,4]\n                            Remove 1: \n                                 set next_avail[1] = find(2) = 2\n                            Then remove 2: \n                                 set next_avail[2] = find(3)=3\n                            Then we add 1 back: set next_avail[1]=1.\n\n                            Now, if we start at 0: \n                                 find(0)=0 -> then remove 0: set next_avail[0]=find(1)=1 -> because we set next_avail[1]=1? \n                            Then we start at 1: find(1)=1 -> available.\n\n                         So it works.\n\n                    However, note: when we add back, we have to set next_avail[win-1] to win-1, regardless of what it was? \n\n                    But what if win-1 was not removed? Then we are setting it to win-1 (which it already is) and that is fine.\n\n                  Implementation of find:\n\n                    function find(i):\n                         if next_avail[i] == i then \n                             return i\n                         else \n                             next_avail[i] = find(next_avail[i])\n                             return next_avail[i]\n\n                  But note: we have an array `next_avail` that we update.\n\n              However, the first program does not use union-find? It uses a TreeSet. But we are free to change the data structure as long as the behavior is the same? \n\n              But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The behavior: the answer array is set as described.\n\n              The TreeSet approach: \n                  It removes the indices in sorted order (from smallest to largest) in the segment [l, r]. Then sets answer[win-1]=0 and adds win-1 back.\n\n              The union-find approach: \n                  It also removes the indices in increasing order? because we start at l and then we jump to the next available? \n\n              So the same.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            integer, allocatable :: next_avail(:), answer(:)\n            integer :: n, q, i, j, l, r, win, curr\n\n            read *, n\n            allocate(next_avail(0:n))   ! indices 0 to n; next_avail(n) = n\n            allocate(answer(0:n-1))\n\n            ! initialize next_avail: for i=0 to n-1, next_avail(i)=i; next_avail(n)=n\n            do i=0, n-1\n                next_avail(i) = i\n            end do\n            next_avail(n) = n\n\n            ! initialize answer to 0? Actually, the Java program initially sets the array to 0? \n            ! But note: in Java the array is initialized to 0. But then we set some values to win, and then set win-1 to 0? \n            answer = 0\n\n            read *, q\n            do j=1, q\n                read *, l, r, win\n                l = l - 1   ! because in Java it adjusted to 0-indexed\n                r = r - 1\n                win = win - 1   ! because we are going to use win-1 as index? but note: the Java program sets win-1 as index. Also, the winner is stored in the answer array for other indices? \n\n                ! We traverse the available indices in [l, r]\n                i = l\n                do while (i <= r)\n                    ! Find the next available index >= i\n                    curr = find(next_avail, i, n)   ! we pass the array and the current i and the sentinel n\n                    if (curr > r) exit\n                    ! set the answer for curr to win+1? because in the Java program, they set to the original win (which is the input, and they stored it without subtracting one). \n                    ! But note: the input win is an integer. The Java program does: \n                    !   answer[curr] = win   [win is the input]\n                    !   then after the while loop: answer[win-1] = 0 and then adds win-1 back to the set.\n                    ! So we set:\n                    answer(curr) = win + 1   ! because we subtracted one from win? but note: we read win and subtracted one? but the win we have now is win-1? \n\n                    ! Actually, we did:\n                    !   read win (the input) -> then set win = win - 1 (so we have the index win-1)\n                    ! But when storing in the answer array for the indices in the segment, we stored the original win (which is win+1 in our variable now) -> no: \n                    !   In Java: \n                    !        int win = in.nextInt();  // original win\n                    !        then in the segment: answer[curr] = win   (the original win)\n                    !   So we must store the original win (which is the input, not win+1).\n\n                    ! Therefore, we should not have subtracted one from the win for the assignment? \n\n                    ! How about we don't subtract one from the win for the assignment? We subtract one only for the index at the end? \n\n                    ! We read l, r, win (as integers)\n                    ! Then we adjust: l = l-1, r = r-1, but for win we need two things:\n                    !   For the segment: we assign the original win to the answer array for the indices in the segment.\n                    !   Then we set the element at index (win-1) to 0.\n\n                    ! Therefore, we should store the original win for the segment? and also remember win_index = win-1 for the last step.\n\n                    ! Let me change: \n                    !   We read l, r, win_orig\n                    !   l = l-1, r = r-1\n                    !   win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    ! Then in the segment: set answer[curr] = win_orig\n                    ! Then at the end: set answer[win_index] = 0 and then add win_index back.\n\n                    ! So we must read the win as win_orig and then compute win_index.\n\n                    ! Therefore, we adjust:\n\n                    !   read *, l, r, win_orig\n                    !   l = l - 1\n                    !   r = r - 1\n                    !   win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    ! But we already read win and subtracted one? So we lost the original win? \n\n                    ! Let me restructure: we will read into temporary variables without modifying?\n\n                    ! Actually, we haven't implemented that part. We are reading in the loop: \n                    !   read *, l, r, win\n                    ! then adjust: l = l-1, r = r-1, and then we set win_index = win-1 and then use win_orig = win for the segment.\n\n                    ! So:\n\n                    win_orig = win\n                    win_index = win - 1\n\n                    Then in the segment: answer(curr) = win_orig\n\n                    But note: we already subtracted one from win? So we did:\n\n                         read win  -> then set win = win - 1   (so win now is win_index)\n\n                    How about we don't do that? \n\n                    We read l, r, win_orig\n                    l = l - 1\n                    r = r - 1\n                    win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    Then we do the segment with assignment: answer(curr) = win_orig\n\n                    Then at the end: set answer(win_index) = 0 and then add win_index back to the available set? \n\n              But wait: we already have the available set implemented with next_avail. How do we add win_index back? \n\n                    We set next_avail(win_index) = win_index   // because we are adding it back.\n\n              However, note: win_index might be outside the current segment? and we are not traversing it? It might have been removed in a previous query? and now we are adding it back.\n\n              So the code for the query:\n\n                    read *, l, r, win_orig\n                    l = l - 1\n                    r = r - 1\n                    win_index = win_orig - 1\n\n                    i = l\n                    do while (i <= r)\n                         curr = find(next_avail, i, n)   ! returns the next available index >= i\n                         if (curr > r) exit\n                         answer(curr) = win_orig\n\n                         ! remove curr: set next_avail[curr] = find(next_avail, curr+1, n)\n                         next_avail(curr) = find(next_avail, curr+1, n)\n\n                         ! update i to skip to the next available after curr: \n                         i = next_avail(curr)   ! but note: next_avail(curr) is the next available starting at curr+1? so we can set i = curr+1? \n                         ! Actually, we can set i = curr+1? because the next available might be beyond? but we are in a loop that starts at i. Alternatively, we can set i = next_avail(curr) and then the loop condition checks.\n\n                    end do\n\n                    ! Then set the winner index: \n                    answer(win_index) = 0\n                    ! Add win_index back: \n                    next_avail(win_index) = win_index   ! this marks it as available? but note: if there was a chain that pointed beyond win_index, we break it? \n\n                    However, we are using path compression: the find function will still work? \n\n                    Example: \n                         Initially: [0,1,2,3] -> next_avail = [0,1,2,3,4]\n                         We remove 0: set next_avail[0]=find(1)=1 -> so next_avail[0]=1.\n                         Then remove 1: set next_avail[1]=find(2)=2.\n                         Then we add 1 back: set next_avail[1]=1.\n                         Then if we do find(0): \n                             find(0): next_avail[0]=1 -> then find(1): next_avail[1]=1 -> so returns 1.\n\n                    This is correct.\n\n              But note: when we add back, we do not update the pointers that might point to win_index? For example, if we have next_avail[0] = 2 (because 1 was removed) and then we add 1 back, then next_avail[0] is still 2? So we skip 1? \n\n              We need to update the chain? Actually, the find function uses recursion and path compression. So when we set next_avail[1]=1, then if we call find(0):\n\n                    find(0): \n                         next_avail[0] = 2 -> then we call find(2) -> which returns 2? but then we set next_avail[0]=2? and return 2.\n\n              But we want find(0) to return 1 now? \n\n              How can we fix? \n\n                  The union-find style for next available is usually for the next available starting at i. When we remove an index, we set next_avail[i]=find(i+1). When we add an index i back, we have to update the next_avail of the indices that point beyond i? \n\n              Alternatively, we can avoid the path compression? \n\n                  The original method without path compression: \n\n                     function find(i):\n                         if next_avail[i] == i then \n                             return i\n                         else \n                             return find(next_avail[i])\n\n                  But then we don't update the path? \n\n                  Without path compression, the set next_avail[1]=1 doesn't help for find(0) because next_avail[0] is still 2. \n\n              We need path compression? But then we update the pointers? \n\n              How about when we add an index i back, we update the next_avail of the indices that point to beyond i to now point to i? That's complicated.\n\n              Alternatively, we can use a separate array for the actual next available? without union-find? We can use a linked list: \n\n                  next_node: array of next pointers? \n                  prev_node: array of prev pointers? \n\n                  We maintain a doubly linked list of available indices? \n\n                  We start with a list: 0<->1<->2<->...<->n-1.\n\n                  Then for a query [l, r]:\n                      we traverse the list starting from the head? but we need to start at the first available >= l.\n\n                  We can use a balanced BST? Not in Fortran.\n\n              Given the complexity and constraints (n,q up to 300000), we need an efficient method.\n\n              Alternatively, we can use a skip list? But Fortran doesn't have that.\n\n              Or we can use a heap? But we need to remove arbitrary elements? \n\n              Another idea: we use a boolean array `is_avail` and then a Fenwick tree to quickly find the next available index >= l? Then we can do:\n\n                 while (there is an available index in [l, r]):\n                    find the smallest index i in [l, r] that is available -> we can use a Fenwick tree for range minimum? but we want the minimum index that is available? \n\n                 But we can maintain a segment tree for the minimum index that is available in a range? \n\n                 We start with an array A: for index i, if available then A[i]=i, else A[i]=infinity.\n\n                 Then we can query the segment [l, r]: min_value = min(A[l..r]). If min_value is infinity, then break. Otherwise, we get the index i = min_value? \n\n                 Then we remove i: set A[i] = infinity, update the segment tree.\n\n                 Then we add win_index back: set A[win_index]=win_index, update the segment tree.\n\n                 The complexity: O(q log n)\n\n              But we already have the union-find method? and we are having trouble with adding back? \n\n              Actually, the adding back is only for win_index, and it happens once per query. And the union-find method we described earlier (with path compression) does not update the pointers that point to a removed node? \n\n              How about we do not use path compression for the next_avail? Then we cannot do the recursive find? \n\n              But without path compression, the find might be O(n). \n\n              Alternatively, we can do a while loop to find the next available: \n\n                  function find(i):\n                     j = i\n                     do while (j < n)\n                         if next_avail(j) == j then \n                             return j\n                         else\n                             j = next_avail(j)\n                     end do\n                     return n   ! sentinel\n\n              Then when we remove an index i, we set next_avail(i) = find(i+1)\n\n              And when we add an index i back, we set next_avail(i) = i.\n\n              Then to find the next available from i, we do:\n\n                  j = i\n                  do while (j < n)\n                      if next_avail(j) == j then \n                          return j\n                      else\n                          j = next_avail(j)\n                  end do\n                  return n\n\n              But worst-case the find is O(n) and then the entire program is O(n*q) -> 300000*300000 = 90e9, which is too slow.\n\n              Therefore, we need a faster method. The segment tree method is O(q log n).\n\n          Given the time constraints, and since Fortran doesn't have built-in trees, we choose the union-find with path compression and hope that the adding back doesn't break the chain? \n\n          But earlier we saw that if we add back an index, then the next_avail for indices pointing to it won't be updated? \n\n          How the path compression works in find:\n\n             function find(i):\n                 if next_avail(i) == i then \n                     return i\n                 else\n                     next_avail(i) = find(next_avail(i))\n                     return next_avail(i)\n\n          When we add back an index i, we set next_avail(i)=i. Then if there is a chain that points to i from behind, the next_avail of the previous nodes are not updated? \n\n          Example:\n\n             Initially: [0,1,2,3] -> next_avail = [0,1,2,3,4]\n\n             Remove 0: \n                 set next_avail(0) = find(1) = 1 -> so next_avail(0)=1.\n             Remove 1:\n                 set next_avail(1) = find(2)=2.\n             Then find(0): \n                 next_avail(0)=1 -> then find(1): next_avail(1)=2 -> then find(2)=2 -> so returns 2.\n                 Then we set next_avail(0)=2? (by path compression)\n\n             Then we add 1 back: set next_avail(1)=1.\n             Then find(0): \n                 next_avail(0)=2 -> then find(2)=2 -> returns 2.\n\n          So we skipped 1? \n\n          That's not what we want. We want find(0) to return 1 now? \n\n          How can we fix? \n\n             We might not want to use path compression? But then the find is O(n) and it might be slow.\n\n          Alternatively, when we add back an index i, we can update the next_avail for all indices that point to beyond i to now point to i? That's expensive.\n\n          Or, we can avoid the path compression and use a different method: \n\n             next_avail(i) points to the next available index >= i. But then if we remove i, we set next_avail(i) = next_avail(i+1). Then to find the next available from i, we look at next_avail(i). \n\n             And when we add back i, we set next_avail(i) = i, and then we also have to update next_avail(i-1) to min(next_avail(i-1), i) ? \n\n             But that's not enough: the next_avail for indices < i might be pointing to something beyond i.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the first program in Java uses a TreeSet which is O(q log n), and we are in Fortran, and we are not required to be efficient? But the constraints are 300000, so we must be efficient.\n\n          Therefore, we decide to use a balanced BST? But Fortran doesn't have one.\n\n          Or we can use a sorted list and use bisect? But removal and insertion in a list is O(n).\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a priority queue? but we need to remove arbitrary elements.\n\n          Another idea: we use a lazy segment tree that marks available indices. Then we can do:\n\n             - To get the first available index >= l: we can do a binary search on a segment tree that stores the minimum available index in the range? \n\n          But we already have a segment tree for the available indices? \n\n          Let's do a segment tree that stores the minimum available index in the segment. If there is none, store a big number.\n\n          We can do:\n\n             tree_size = 1\n             do while (tree_size < n)\n                 tree_size = tree_size * 2\n             end do\n\n             allocate(tree(2*tree_size))\n             tree = a big number (like n+1)\n\n             subroutine update(pos, value)\n                 ! update the leaf at pos to value, and then update parents.\n\n             function query(l, r):\n                 ! return the minimum value in [l, r]\n\n          Initially, for i=0 to n-1: tree[leaf(i)] = i.\n\n          Then for a query [l, r, win_orig] and win_index=win_orig-1:\n\n             do\n                 pos = query(l, r)   ! the smallest available index in [l, r]\n                 if (pos > r) exit\n                 answer(pos) = win_orig\n                 ! remove pos: update(pos, big_number)\n\n                 ! then set in our segment tree: update(pos, big_number)\n             end do\n\n             ! Then add win_index back: update(win_index, win_index)\n\n             ! Also, we set answer(win_index)=0\n\n          But the Java program does not remove win_index in this query? because it is added back. But win_index might be in [l, r]? \n\n          In the Java program, they remove all indices in [l, r] including win_index? and then they set answer[win_index]=0 and add it back. So in our segment tree, we remove win_index in the do loop? and then we add it back at the end.\n\n          How many times can win_index appear in a query? only once per query? \n\n          But win_index might be outside [l, r]? then we don't remove it in the do loop, but then we set answer(win_index)=0 and add it back? but it was not removed? so we shouldn't add it back? \n\n          In the Java program: \n             they do: \n                 while (remove all indices in [l, r]) -> win_index might be in [l, r]? then it is removed? and then later they set answer[win_index]=0 and add it back.\n\n          So regardless of whether win_index is in [l, r] or not, they set it to 0 and add it back.\n\n          Therefore, in our segment tree, if win_index is in [l, r], then we remove it in the do loop and then add it back at the end. If it is not in [l, r], then we set answer(win_index)=0 and add it back? but it was never removed? so we are setting it to available again? \n\n          But note: win_index might have been removed in a previous query? and then we are adding it back now.\n\n          The Java program does: \n             left.add(win-1)   // win-1 might be in the set or not? but if it was removed in a previous query, then we are adding it back. \n\n          So in our segment tree, when we add win_index back, we set it to available.\n\n          Therefore, the update for win_index should be: \n             if it is not available, then we set it to available.\n\n          But in our segment tree, we update: update(win_index, win_index)   // which means it is available.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          The complexity: O(q * (number of indices in the segment) * log n) -> worst-case O(n*q*log n) -> too slow.\n\n          The Java program uses a TreeSet and it removes each knight exactly once (except win_index which is removed and added back once per query that covers it). So the total number of removals is O(n + q) because win_index might be added and removed multiple times. But in the worst-case, each query might remove O(n) knights, so total O(q*n) which is 300000 * 300000 = 90e9, which is too slow.\n\n          But the original problem (codeforces 356 A) is with constraints 300000, and they use a TreeSet and break out of the loop by removing each knight only once. Specifically, each knight is removed at most once (except win_index which is removed and then added back) so win_index might be removed and added many times. \n\n          However, the win_index for a query is then added back, so it might be removed in future queries. The total number of times a knight is removed is at most the number of queries in which it is in the segment (and not the win_index) or when it is the win_index, it is removed and then added back, so it might be removed again.\n\n          The worst-case might be O(q) per knight? \n\n          Therefore, the total number of knight removals is O(n + q) because the first time a knight is removed (other than win_index) it is gone forever, and win_index is removed and added back. In one query, win_index might be removed and then added back, so net change is 0. But then in a future query, win_index might be removed again? \n\n          So the total number of times the do-while loop runs is: \n             initially n knights.\n             then in each query, we remove (number of indices in [l, r] that are still available) - 1 (because win_index is added back) or if win_index was in the segment and removed, then we remove (count-1) because we add win_index back.\n\n          Therefore, the total number of removals is n + q? because win_index is added back q times, so it can be removed up to q times, and the other knights are removed once.\n\n          Therefore, the entire loop over all queries will remove at most n + q elements. \n\n          So the segment tree method would be O((n+q) * log n) = 600000 * log2(300000) which is about 600000 * 19 = 11.4e6, which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we will use a segment tree for range minimum query.\n\n          Steps for the segment tree:\n\n            We will build a segment tree that supports:\n               update(i, value): set the value at position i to value.\n               query(l, r): return the minimum value in [l, r] and also the index where that minimum occurs? or just the value? \n\n            Actually, we want the smallest available index in [l, r]. So we store in the tree the available index if the leaf is available, or a big number if not. Then the minimum value in [l, r] will be the smallest available index, or a big number if none.\n\n            But note: we only care about the smallest available index. So we can do:\n\n               tree_size = 1\n               do while (tree_size < n)\n                   tree_size = tree_size * 2\n               end do\n\n               allocate(tree(2 * tree_size))\n               tree = big   ! big = n+1\n\n               ! build: for i=0 to n-1, tree(tree_size + i) = i   ? because initially available.\n               !        for i=n to tree_size-1, tree(tree_size+i) = big\n\n               then for i=tree_size-1 downto 1, tree(i) = min(tree(2*i), tree(2*i+1))\n\n            Then update(pos, value): \n                 set tree(tree_size+pos) = value\n                 then update the parents: i = (tree_size+pos)/2, then up to 1.\n\n            Then query(l, r): \n                 res = big\n                 l0 = l + tree_size  [if we stored from index 0 to tree_size-1 in the leaves? but we have tree_size leaves for indices 0..tree_size-1? and we only care about 0..n-1]\n                 r0 = r + tree_size\n                 while (l0 <= r0) ... (standard segment tree for range minimum query)\n\n            Then in the query: \n                 do \n                    idx = query(l, r)   ! the smallest available index in [l, r]\n                    if (idx > r) exit\n                    ! remove idx: update(idx, big)\n                    answer(idx) = win_orig\n                    call update(idx, big)\n                 end do\n\n            Then set answer(win_index) = 0\n            call update(win_index, win_index)   ! add win_index back\n\n          But note: win_index might have been removed in a previous query? and then we are setting it to available again.\n\n          However, it might be currently available? then we are setting it to win_index (which is its index) and that's the same as before? \n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Also, initially, we set for i=0..n-1: tree[tree_size+i]=i.\n\n          Then the first query: \n               query(0, n-1) will return 0.\n\n          We remove 0: update(0, big)\n          Then win_index might be 0? then we set answer(0)=0 and update(0,0) -> available again.\n\n          But note: in the first query, win_index might be 0? then after the do loop, we set answer(0)=0 and then update(0,0) -> available.\n\n          However, in the do loop we removed 0? and then win_index=0, so we add it back.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          We must be cautious: indices in Fortran: do we use 0-indexed or 1-indexed? \n\n          The problem: the input and the array in Java are 0-indexed. In Fortran, we can use 0-indexed arrays.\n\n          Fortran allows:\n\n             integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: answer\n\n          But the segment tree: we will use 0-indexed for the leaves from 0 to tree_size-1.\n\n          However, our data: only indices 0 to n-1 matter.\n\n          Implementation of the segment tree for range minimum query (with index 0 to n-1 stored in leaves starting at tree_size to tree_size+n-1).\n\n          We'll use:\n             tree_size = 1\n             do while (tree_size < n)\n                 tree_size = 2 * tree_size\n             end do\n\n             tree(1:2*tree_size)   ! 1-indexed tree: the leaves are at tree_size to tree_size+n-1, and tree_size+n to 2*tree_size are leaves for n to tree_size-1? and we set them to big.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do a 0-indexed tree? \n\n          Let me do a 1-indexed tree for the segment tree array, but the leaves for index i (0<=i<n) will be at position tree_size + i + 1? \n\n          Instead, let's do:\n\n             segment_tree%n = n\n             segment_tree%size = 1\n             do while (segment_tree%size < n)\n                 segment_tree%size = segment_tree%size * 2\n             end do\n\n             allocate(segment_tree%tree(2 * segment_tree%size))   ! size of the array: 2 * segment_tree%size\n\n             do i=0, n-1\n                 segment_tree%tree(segment_tree%size + i) = i   ! if available, else big\n             end do\n             do i=n, segment_tree%size-1\n                 segment_tree%tree(segment_tree%size + i) = big\n             end do\n             do i= segment_tree%size-1, 1, -1\n                 segment_tree%tree(i) = min(segment_tree%tree(2*i), segment_tree%tree(2*i+1))\n             end do\n\n          Then the update and query accordingly.\n\n          Given the complexity of implementation, and the fact that we then have to do the second and third programs? which are trivial, we will do:\n\n             - Read n, q.\n             - Build the segment tree.\n             - Initialize answer array to 0.\n             - For each query: \n                   read l, r, win_orig\n                   l = l-1, r = r-1, win_index = win_orig-1\n                   do \n                         idx = query(l, r)   ! the smallest available index in [l, r]\n                         if (idx > r) exit\n                         answer(idx) = win_orig\n                         call update(idx, big)   ! remove it\n                   end do\n                   answer(win_index) = 0\n                   call update(win_index, win_index)   ! add it back\n\n             - Then we are done with the first program.\n\n             - Then we know that the second program would have output \"1\", and the third program would have output \"No\", so we output \"No\".\n\n          But wait, the first program's output is a string of the answer array? and then the second program reads that string and outputs 1, and then the third program reads 1 and outputs \"No\". \n\n          Therefore, we don't need to build the string at all? \n\n          However, the first program might have side effects on the available set? But then the available set is not used beyond the program. \n\n          And the answer array is not used beyond the first program's output? and we are not outputting it? \n\n          But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The behavior of the chain is: \n                output of the entire chain is \"No\", and it reads the input and processes it as the first program.\n\n          Therefore, we can skip building the answer array? \n\n          But the first program's output is the answer array as a string. The second program then reads that string. We said the second program always outputs 1, but what if the string is very long? The first program might take a long time to build the string? \n\n          In the first program, it does:\n\n                StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    ans.append(answer[i] + \"\");\n                }\n                System.out.println(ans);\n\n          This is O(n). In Fortran, we could do:\n\n                character(len=:), allocatable :: long_str\n                allocate(character(len=10*n) :: long_str)   ! in case each number has up to 10 digits, but n up to 300000, so 3e6 digits? \n\n          But then we know the second program will output 1 regardless, and the third program will output \"No\". \n\n          And the combined program should not do I/O in the middle. \n\n          Therefore, we can skip building the string? \n\n          But the first program's output is provided to the second program. We are to avoid I/O, but we are allowed to not use the string? because the second program's output is independent of the string. \n\n          However, to be faithful, we must at least know that the first program's output is a string of n integers. The second program will then read that string and split it? and then output 1. \n\n          Since we are not using the string, and we are not doing I/O, we can skip it. \n\n          Therefore, the combined program:\n\n             program combined\n                 implicit none\n\n                 integer, parameter :: big = 10000000   ! big number, larger than n (which is <=300000)\n                 integer :: n, q, i, j, l, r, win_orig, win_index, idx\n                 integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: answer\n                 ! variables for the segment tree\n                 integer :: tree_size\n                 integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: tree\n\n                 !

We hope to get the segment tree right.\n\n          If not, we might use a brute-force for the first program? but n and q up to 300000 -> not possible.\n\n          Given the time, here is the Fortran program."
