Step 3: Now we have min_cost (an integer). This becomes the input to the second program. The second program:\n\n          n = min_cost   [but note: the original program2 uses a long, so we use a long variable for n2]\n\n          However, note: min_cost might be negative? The first program outputs either -1 or a positive integer (costs are positive). The second program expects a positive long? Because it does factorization. But what if min_cost is -1? Then we pass -1 to program2. The second program:\n\n            sqrt = sqrt(n) [if n is negative, sqrt is complex -> but Fortran would take the absolute value? Actually, the original Java uses (long) and then sqrt -> for negative, it would be NaN?] However, the original program2 starts with:\n\n            long n = scanner.nextLong();\n\n            Then it computes sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   -> if n is negative, Math.sqrt(n) is NaN, then cast to int becomes 0? Actually, in Java, Math.sqrt for negative returns NaN, and converting NaN to int is 0? But the loop runs from 2 to sqrt (which is 0) -> so the loop runs from 2 to 0 (which doesn't run). Then it checks if n>1? If n==-1, then n>1 is false -> so answer=0. Then the third program: gets the string \"0\" -> which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B' -> outputs \"No\". So we have to handle negative numbers? But note the problem context: the first program outputs either -1 (if no valid combination) or a positive integer. We can do:\n\n            n2 = min_cost [if min_cost is -1, then n2=-1]\n\n          Then we run the second program on n2. Steps for program2:\n\n            Let n2 = min_cost (as a long integer) If n2 <= 1, then we skip the factorization? Actually, the original program:\n\n                for (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) ... then if n>1, then answer++. For n2 = -1: \n                sqrt = floor(sqrt(-1)) -> but in Fortran, the argument to SQRT must be nonnegative? We must avoid negative. How about: if n2 <= 1, then we don't run the factorization loop? But note the original program does:\n\n                int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   -> if n is negative, then sqrt becomes 0? (But in Java, Math.sqrt returns NaN for negative, and then cast to int is 0). Then the loop runs from 2 to 0 -> does not run. Then if n>1: if n2>1 then add 1? But -1 is not >1 -> so answer remains 0. So we can do:\n\n            exponent_count = 0 if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = floor(sqrt(real(n2)))   -> but wait, n2 might be negative? We must avoid. Actually, we should mimic the Java program: it only runs the factorization for positive n? The problem of the second program is for positive integers? The problem: factorizing a positive integer. How to handle negative? The original program2 does not handle negative. But the input is a long, and the program does:\n\n            for (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) ... In Java, if n is negative, the condition (0 == (n % i)) is checked. But modulus for negative: in Java, the modulus can be negative? Actually, the condition is: while (0 == (n % i)) But if n is negative, then n%i is negative? For example, (-1)%2 is -1? Then the condition fails. So the loop is skipped. Then the program checks: if (n>1) then answer++. For n=-1: n>1 is false -> exponent_count remains 0. So we can do:\n\n            n2 = min_cost [if min_cost is -1, then n2=-1]\n\n            exponent_count = 0\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8))) [but n2>1 so positive]\n\n            However, what if n2 is 0? Then we skip the factorization and then n2>1 is false -> exponent_count=0. What if n2=1? Then same. But note: the original program2 also handles n2=0? The condition: n>1? 0>1 -> false. So exponent_count=0. So we can write:\n\n            exponent_count = 0\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)), but note: n2 might be large, so we use integer arithmetic? Actually, we can compute the integer square root. However, in Fortran, we can use:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: n2\n            integer :: sqrt_val\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)), but this might be inexact for large integers. Alternatively, we can compute the integer square root by:\n\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8))) [and then we can adjust by checking if (sqrt_val+1)**2 <= n2?] But the Java program uses:\n\n            int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n); This truncates to the next lower integer? Yes. We do:\n\n            sqrt_val = floor(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8))) [but we are using integers]\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))",

But the first program's cost can be up to 12 books * 10000 (per cost) -> 120000, which fits in 4-byte integer. But the second program uses long. So we can use a 4-byte integer for min_cost, but then we cast to 8-byte for n2. Step 4: Convert exponent_count to a string. We write the integer exponent_count to a character variable. Step 5: Check the string (from step4) for containing both 'A' and 'B'.

Actually, we can use a temporary variable. temp = n2   ! but note: we are going to modify temp\n\n            if (temp > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(temp, kind=8)))   ! this is the integer square root (truncated)\n\n                ! note: we must iterate i from 2 to sqrt_val\n                do i=2, sqrt_val\n                    count = 0\n                    do while (mod(temp, int(i, kind=8)) == 0)\n                        temp = temp / i\n                        count = count + 1\n                    end do\n\n                    j = 1\n                    do while (count >= j)\n                        exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                        count = count - j\n                        j = j + 1\n                    end do\n                end do\n\n                if (temp > 1) then\n                    exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                end if\n            end if\n\n        Now exponent_count is the result of program2. 4. Convert exponent_count to a string:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        write(str, *) exponent_count\n        str = adjustl(str)   ! left adjust\n\n        But note: the original program3 reads the entire token? The next() in Java reads the next token. The token would be the entire string of digits. 5. Simulate program3:\n\n        logical :: foundA = .false., foundB = .false.\n        integer :: idx\n\n        do idx=1, len_trim(str)\n            if (str(idx:idx)=='A') foundA = .true. if (str(idx:idx)=='B') foundB = .true.\n        end do\n\n        if (foundA .and. foundB) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original code is:\n\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n  This matches. But note: what if the exponent_count is negative? But the second program only outputs nonnegative, so no.\n\n  Also note: the second program does not output negative. But what about the first program: min_cost can be -1. Then the second program: \n        n2 = -1 -> skip the factorization loop (because -1<=1) -> exponent_count=0. Then the string is \"0\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\". This matches. However, let's test with a small example:\n\n    Example for program1: \n        n=3, m=3, x=10\n        Books:\n          cost1=10, [1, 1, 1]   -> book1: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n          book2: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n          book3: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n\n        Then any single book: understanding=1+1+1=3 <10 -> invalid. Two books: 2+2+2=6 <10 -> invalid. Three books: 3+3+3=9 <10 -> invalid. Then min_cost = -1. Then program2: input=-1 -> exponent_count=0. Then program3: input string \"0\" -> output \"No\". What if we have a valid set? Example: \n        n=2, m=2, x=10\n        Book1: [10, 10, 10]\n        Book2: [20, 10, 10]\n\n        Then we can take book1: cost=10, and understanding=10,10 -> valid -> min_cost=10. Then program2: input=10. Factorize 10: 2 and 5. i=2: count=1 -> then j=1: 1>=1 -> exponent_count=1, then count=0 -> done with 2. Then i=3,4,... up to sqrt(10)=3 -> then i=3: no. Then after the loop, temp=5>1 -> exponent_count becomes 2. Then the string is \"2\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\". So the entire chain for this example outputs \"No\". We are done. But note: the Java programs are independent and we are chaining. We have to be cautious about data types. Let's code accordingly. Important: The Fortran program should read from stdin and write to stdout. We'll write:\n\n    program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! ... declarations ...\n\n        !

Step 2: Simulate program1\n        min_cost = big\n        do bitmask = 0, 2**n - 1\n            !

Then we check `n2>1` at the end. This is the same as the original. However, the original program2 uses the same variable. We'll test with n2=10: Initially, n2=10\n        sqrt_val = int(sqrt(10.0)) = 3\n        i=2: \n            mod(10,2)==0 -> count=1, n2=5\n            then jj=1: count=1>=1 -> exponent_count=1, count=0 -> break inner while. i=3: \n            mod(5,3) ! =0 -> skip. Then n2=5>1 -> exponent_count becomes 2. Then the string is \"2\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\". But the expected exponent_count for 10 is 2? The original program2: \n        n=10\n        i=2: count=1 -> then j=1: count-1=0 -> exponent_count=1, then j=2: 0-2<0 -> break. then i=3: ... then at the end n=5>1 -> exponent_count=1+1=2. So it's correct. However, note: the inner loop for j in the original program2 is:\n\n        for (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) { count -= j;\n            answer++;\n        }\n\n  We did:\n\n        jj=1\n        do while (count>=jj)\n            exponent_count = exponent_count+1\n            count = count - jj jj = jj+1\n        end do\n\n  This is the same. We are done. But note: the condition in the original program2 for the factorization loop: i runs from 2 to sqrt (inclusive). We do the same. Let me write the final code. However, note: the mod function for large integers? We are using integer(kind=8) for n2, but i is integer(4). We convert i to kind=8 when doing mod. We do: mod(n2, int(i, kind=8)) This is safe. Also, the division: n2 = n2 / i   -> i is integer(4). But Fortran will promote? We do: n2 = n2 / int(i, kind=8) to avoid overflow?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The idea is to chain the programs: the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and then the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n However, note that the original Java programs are independent and each reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n We are to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC167_C) reads integers n, m, x, and then a matrix of n rows and m+1 columns.\n    It then does some computation and outputs an integer (either the minimum cost or -1).\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC169_D) reads a long integer (which would be the output of the first program) and then does factorization and counts exponents.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string (which would be the output of the second program, an integer) and then checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n    But note: the output of the second program is an integer, so when passed to the third program as a string, it would be a string of digits.\n\n    However, the third program expects a string and then checks for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'. Since the string is composed of digits, it will never contain 'A' or 'B'. \n    Therefore, the third program would always output \"No\".\n\n But wait, let's reexamine the chain:\n\n  Program 1: Input -> integers (n, m, x) and a matrix. Output -> an integer (min or -1).\n  Program 2: Input -> a long integer (the output of program 1). Output -> an integer (the answer of the exponent counting).\n  Program 3: Input -> a string (the output of program 2). Then checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n This chain does not make sense in terms of the problem contexts. However, we are to reproduce the chain.\n\n But note: the instructions say \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we have:\n\n  Step1: Run the logic of program1 on the original input (from stdin) to get an integer (let's call it result1).\n  Step2: Use result1 as the input to program2. Program2 will then output an integer (result2).\n  Step3: Convert result2 to a string and use that as the input to program3. Program3 will then output either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n However, the third program in the original code (atcoder_ABC158_A) does not read an integer but a string. The problem in the original ABC158 A is:\n\n    There are three towns A, B, C, and a string S of length 3. The bus service might be unavailable in some towns. \n    The input is a string S (like \"AAB\", \"ABC\", etc.). The program checks if there is a town with bus and one without? \n    Actually, the problem: \"We have a string S of length 3. Determine if S contains both 'A' and 'B'.\"\n\n    Example: \n        \"ABA\" -> contains both -> \"Yes\"\n        \"BBB\" -> does not contain 'A' -> \"No\"\n\n But note: the output of program2 is an integer, which is then passed as a string to program3.\n\n However, the integer from program2 is a nonnegative integer (number of operations). For example, if the output of program2 is 12, then the string is \"12\". \n This string does not contain the letter 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the third program will always output \"No\".\n\n But wait, the chain is fixed: we must follow the sequence.\n\n How to structure the Fortran program:\n\n  - We read the input for the first program (n, m, x and the matrix) from standard input.\n  - Then we run the logic of program1 to compute result1 (an integer).\n  - Then we run the logic of program2 using result1 as the starting value of n (which is now a long integer? but note: program2 uses a long for n, and result1 is an integer which can be cast to long).\n  - Then we run the logic of program3 using the integer output of program2 (converted to a string) as the input string.\n\n However, note: the third program expects a string. We have to convert the integer (result2) to a string.\n\n But Fortran does not have built-in string conversion for integers? Actually, we can use internal files (write to a string).\n\n Steps:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n\n  Step 2: Simulate program1 to get an integer (min_cost). If no valid combination, then min_cost = -1.\n\n  Step 3: Use min_cost as the input to program2. But note: program2 expects a long integer. We can pass the integer value.\n\n  Step 4: Simulate program2 to get an integer (exponent_count).\n\n  Step 5: Convert exponent_count to a string (say, str).\n\n  Step 6: Simulate program3: check if the string str contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it's a string of digits, we know it won't, but we do the check.\n\n  Step 7: Output the result of program3: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n However, note: the original program3 outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the final output of the chain is one of these.\n\n But wait: the chain is:\n\n   Input (for program1) -> Output of program1 (integer) -> becomes input for program2 -> Output of program2 (integer) -> becomes input for program3 (as string) -> Output of program3 (string)\n\n So the entire program should read the input for program1 and then output the string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Implementation:\n\n  We break down the Fortran program:\n\n    Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, m, x, and then the matrix of n rows, each with m+1 integers).\n\n    Step 2: Simulate the first program:\n\n        We are to try all subsets of the n books (bitmask from 0 to 2**n-1). For each subset:\n            - Create an array `res` of length m+1 (indexed 0..m) to accumulate the cost (index0) and the understanding (index1..m).\n            - For each book j in the subset, add the j-th row of the matrix to `res`.\n            - Then check if for every j from 1 to m: res[j] >= x.\n            - If yes, then update min_cost = min(min_cost, res[0])\n\n        If min_cost remains at the initial large value, set min_cost = -1.\n\n    Step 3: Now we have min_cost (an integer). This becomes the input to the second program.\n\n        The second program:\n\n          n = min_cost   [but note: the original program2 uses a long, so we use a long variable for n2]\n\n          However, note: min_cost might be negative? The first program outputs either -1 or a positive integer (costs are positive). \n          The second program expects a positive long? Because it does factorization. \n\n          But what if min_cost is -1? Then we pass -1 to program2.\n\n          The second program:\n\n            sqrt = sqrt(n)   [if n is negative, sqrt is complex -> but Fortran would take the absolute value? Actually, the original Java uses (long) and then sqrt -> for negative, it would be NaN?]\n\n          However, the original program2 starts with:\n\n            long n = scanner.nextLong();\n\n            Then it computes sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   -> if n is negative, Math.sqrt(n) is NaN, then cast to int becomes 0? Actually, in Java, Math.sqrt for negative returns NaN, and converting NaN to int is 0? But the loop runs from 2 to sqrt (which is 0) -> so the loop runs from 2 to 0 (which doesn't run). Then it checks if n>1? If n==-1, then n>1 is false -> so answer=0.\n\n          Then the third program: gets the string \"0\" -> which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B' -> outputs \"No\".\n\n          So we have to handle negative numbers? But note the problem context: the first program outputs either -1 (if no valid combination) or a positive integer.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            n2 = min_cost   [if min_cost is -1, then n2=-1]\n\n          Then we run the second program on n2.\n\n          Steps for program2:\n\n            Let n2 = min_cost (as a long integer)\n\n            If n2 <= 1, then we skip the factorization? Actually, the original program:\n\n                for (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) ... \n                then if n>1, then answer++.\n\n            For n2 = -1: \n                sqrt = floor(sqrt(-1)) -> but in Fortran, the argument to SQRT must be nonnegative? We must avoid negative.\n\n            How about: if n2 <= 1, then we don't run the factorization loop? But note the original program does:\n\n                int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   -> if n is negative, then sqrt becomes 0? (But in Java, Math.sqrt returns NaN for negative, and then cast to int is 0). Then the loop runs from 2 to 0 -> does not run.\n\n            Then if n>1: if n2>1 then add 1? But -1 is not >1 -> so answer remains 0.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            exponent_count = 0\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = floor(sqrt(real(n2)))   -> but wait, n2 might be negative? We must avoid.\n\n          Actually, we should mimic the Java program: it only runs the factorization for positive n? The problem of the second program is for positive integers? The problem: factorizing a positive integer.\n\n          How to handle negative? The original program2 does not handle negative. But the input is a long, and the program does:\n\n            for (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) ... \n\n          In Java, if n is negative, the condition (0 == (n % i)) is checked. But modulus for negative: in Java, the modulus can be negative? Actually, the condition is: while (0 == (n % i)) \n\n          But if n is negative, then n%i is negative? For example, (-1)%2 is -1? Then the condition fails. So the loop is skipped.\n\n          Then the program checks: if (n>1) then answer++.\n\n          For n=-1: n>1 is false -> exponent_count remains 0.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            n2 = min_cost   [if min_cost is -1, then n2=-1]\n\n            exponent_count = 0\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))   [but n2>1 so positive]\n\n            However, what if n2 is 0? Then we skip the factorization and then n2>1 is false -> exponent_count=0.\n\n            What if n2=1? Then same.\n\n          But note: the original program2 also handles n2=0? The condition: n>1? 0>1 -> false. So exponent_count=0.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            exponent_count = 0\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)), but note: n2 might be large, so we use integer arithmetic? Actually, we can compute the integer square root.\n\n          However, in Fortran, we can use:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: n2\n            integer :: sqrt_val\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)), but this might be inexact for large integers.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the integer square root by:\n\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))   [and then we can adjust by checking if (sqrt_val+1)**2 <= n2?]\n\n          But the Java program uses:\n\n            int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);\n\n          This truncates to the next lower integer? Yes.\n\n          We do:\n\n            sqrt_val = floor(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))   [but we are using integers]\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))   [this truncates to the integer part, which is the floor for positive]\n\n          Then we iterate i from 2 to sqrt_val.\n\n          Then, for each i, we count the exponent:\n\n            count = 0\n            do while (mod(n2, i) == 0)\n                n2 = n2 / i\n                count = count + 1\n            end do\n\n            Then, for j from 1 upwards until count < j:\n                if (count >= j) then\n                    exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                    count = count - j\n                end if\n\n          Then after the loop, if n2>1, exponent_count = exponent_count + 1.\n\n          But note: the Java program uses integer division and modulus for long integers. We must use integer(kind=8) for n2 and for modulus.\n\n          However, the input to the second program is the output of the first program, which is an integer. The maximum value of min_cost might be large? But the first program's cost can be up to 12 books * 10000 (per cost) -> 120000, which fits in 4-byte integer. But the second program uses long. So we can use a 4-byte integer for min_cost, but then we cast to 8-byte for n2.\n\n    Step 4: Convert exponent_count to a string.\n\n        We write the integer exponent_count to a character variable.\n\n    Step 5: Check the string (from step4) for containing both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n        Since the string is composed of digits (and possibly a minus sign? but exponent_count is nonnegative: the second program outputs a nonnegative integer) -> no minus.\n\n        So we traverse the string and check:\n\n            foundA = .false.\n            foundB = .false.\n            do i=1, len_trim(string)\n                if (string(i:i) == 'A') foundA = .true.\n                if (string(i:i) == 'B') foundB = .true.\n            end do\n\n        Then if (foundA .and. foundB) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n\n    However, note: the original program3 outputs without newline? Actually, it uses println -> adds a newline.\n\n    But the problem: the third program in the original ABC158_A outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" and then a newline.\n\n    We do the same.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We must use modules for large integers? Actually, we can use integer(kind=8) for n2.\n\n   Steps:\n\n    1. Declare variables for the first program.\n\n        integer :: n, m, x\n        integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)   ! (n, 0:m)  or (n, 1:m+1) -> we'll use (1:n, 1:m+1)\n\n        Read: \n            read(*,*) n, m, x\n            allocate(a(n, m+1))\n            do i=1, n\n                read(*,*) (a(i, j), j=1, m+1)\n            end do\n\n    2. Simulate program1:\n\n        integer :: min_cost = huge(0)   ! huge integer\n        integer :: i, j, k, bitmask, total\n        integer, allocatable :: res(:)   ! size m+1\n\n        allocate(res(m+1))\n\n        do bitmask = 0, 2**n - 1\n            res = 0\n            do i = 0, n-1   ! we are going to check the i-th bit of bitmask\n                if (btest(bitmask, i)) then   ! the i-th bit is set? (i=0 corresponds to the first element)\n                    do k = 1, m+1\n                        res(k) = res(k) + a(i+1, k)   ! because the first row is a(1,:)\n                    end do\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            flag = .true.\n            do k = 2, m+1   ! because the understanding starts at index 2? Actually, the first element is cost, then the m understandings are at indices 2 to m+1? \n                if (res(k) < x) then\n                    flag = .false.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (flag) then\n                if (res(1) < min_cost) min_cost = res(1)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (min_cost == huge(0)) then\n            min_cost = -1\n        end if\n\n    3. Now min_cost is the result of program1.\n\n        Then we set n2 = min_cost (as a long integer)\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: n2 = min_cost   ! but min_cost might be negative? so we use integer(kind=8) for n2.\n\n        Now simulate program2:\n\n            integer :: exponent_count = 0\n            integer :: sqrt_val, i, j, count\n            integer(kind=8) :: temp   ! we don't want to destroy n2? Actually, we can use a temporary variable.\n\n            temp = n2   ! but note: we are going to modify temp\n\n            if (temp > 1) then\n                sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(temp, kind=8)))   ! this is the integer square root (truncated)\n\n                ! note: we must iterate i from 2 to sqrt_val\n                do i=2, sqrt_val\n                    count = 0\n                    do while (mod(temp, int(i, kind=8)) == 0)\n                        temp = temp / i\n                        count = count + 1\n                    end do\n\n                    j = 1\n                    do while (count >= j)\n                        exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                        count = count - j\n                        j = j + 1\n                    end do\n                end do\n\n                if (temp > 1) then\n                    exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                end if\n            end if\n\n        Now exponent_count is the result of program2.\n\n    4. Convert exponent_count to a string:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        write(str, *) exponent_count\n        str = adjustl(str)   ! left adjust\n\n        But note: the original program3 reads the entire token? The next() in Java reads the next token. The token would be the entire string of digits.\n\n    5. Simulate program3:\n\n        logical :: foundA = .false., foundB = .false.\n        integer :: idx\n\n        do idx=1, len_trim(str)\n            if (str(idx:idx)=='A') foundA = .true.\n            if (str(idx:idx)=='B') foundB = .true.\n        end do\n\n        if (foundA .and. foundB) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original code is:\n\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n  This matches.\n\n  But note: what if the exponent_count is negative? But the second program only outputs nonnegative, so no.\n\n  Also note: the second program does not output negative.\n\n  But what about the first program: min_cost can be -1. Then the second program: \n        n2 = -1 -> skip the factorization loop (because -1<=1) -> exponent_count=0.\n\n  Then the string is \"0\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\".\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, let's test with a small example:\n\n    Example for program1: \n        n=3, m=3, x=10\n        Books:\n          cost1=10, [1, 1, 1]   -> book1: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n          book2: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n          book3: [10, 1, 1, 1]\n\n        Then any single book: understanding=1+1+1=3 <10 -> invalid.\n        Two books: 2+2+2=6 <10 -> invalid.\n        Three books: 3+3+3=9 <10 -> invalid.\n\n        Then min_cost = -1.\n\n    Then program2: input=-1 -> exponent_count=0.\n    Then program3: input string \"0\" -> output \"No\".\n\n  What if we have a valid set?\n\n    Example: \n        n=2, m=2, x=10\n        Book1: [10, 10, 10]\n        Book2: [20, 10, 10]\n\n        Then we can take book1: cost=10, and understanding=10,10 -> valid -> min_cost=10.\n\n        Then program2: input=10.\n\n        Factorize 10: 2 and 5.\n          i=2: count=1 -> then j=1: 1>=1 -> exponent_count=1, then count=0 -> done with 2.\n          Then i=3,4,... up to sqrt(10)=3 -> then i=3: no.\n          Then after the loop, temp=5>1 -> exponent_count becomes 2.\n\n        Then the string is \"2\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\".\n\n  So the entire chain for this example outputs \"No\".\n\n  We are done.\n\n  But note: the Java programs are independent and we are chaining. We have to be cautious about data types.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: The Fortran program should read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n    program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! ... declarations ...\n\n        !

Step 3: Simulate program2 with input n2 = min_cost\n        n2 = min_cost\n        exponent_count = 0\n\n        if (n2 > 1) then\n            ! Compute the integer square root of n2\n            sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)))\n\n            do i=2, sqrt_val\n                count = 0\n                do while (mod(n2, int(i, kind=8)) == 0)\n                    n2 = n2 / i\n                    count = count + 1\n                end do\n\n                jj = 1\n                do while (count >= jj)\n                    exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n                    count = count - jj\n                    jj = jj + 1\n                end do\n            end do\n\n            if (n2 > 1) then\n                exponent_count = exponent_count + 1\n            end if\n\n        else if (n2 < 0) then\n            ! For negative numbers, we skip the factorization loop.\n            ! But we need to check the condition at the end? The original program2 does: if (n>1) then ... \n            ! But n2 is negative -> n2>1 is false -> so exponent_count remains 0.\n            ! Do nothing.\n        end if\n\n        ! However, note: we modified n2 in the factorization. But we are done with it.\n\n        ! Step 4: Convert exponent_count to a string\n        write(str, '(I20)') exponent_count\n        str = adjustl(str)   ! left adjust\n\n        ! Step 5: Simulate program3\n        foundA = .false.\n        foundB = .false.\n        do i=1, len_trim(str)\n            if (str(i:i) == 'A') foundA = .true.\n            if (str(i:i) == 'B') foundB = .true.\n        end do\n\n        if (foundA .and. foundB) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n\n    end program\n\n  But note: in the factorization loop of program2, we used n2 and modified it. However, the condition at the end uses the modified n2 (which may be 1 or greater). \n\n  Also note: the original program2 uses a temporary variable (n) and modifies it. We did the same.\n\n  However, we have a problem: in the factorization loop, we are using the global n2. But we are done with the original n2? We only need the exponent_count.\n\n  But what about negative? We skip the loop and then the condition at the end? We already skipped the loop for n2<=1, and for negative we skip the loop. Then we don't do the condition at the end? \n\n  Actually, the condition at the end is only done if n2>1. For negative, we skip the entire if (n2>1) block. So we are safe.\n\n  However, note: we did not handle n2=0 or n2=1? They are skipped because the condition is n2>1.\n\n  Also note: the factorization loop only runs for n2>1.\n\n  But wait, the original program2 does:\n\n        if (n>1) { ... }\n\n  So we are consistent.\n\n  But there is a bug: in the factorization loop, we are using the global n2 and modifying it. Then after the loop, we check the same n2 (which has been divided by factors). This is correct.\n\n  However, we must note: we are using the same variable n2 for the factorization. But we have to use a temporary variable? Actually, we did:\n\n        n2 = min_cost   ! and then we factorize n2? \n\n  But we don't care about the original n2 after the factorization. We only need the exponent_count.\n\n  But what about the condition at the end? We use the modified n2. This is the same as the original program2.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  However, there is a potential problem: the factorization loop runs for i from 2 to sqrt_val, but after dividing, n2 becomes smaller and sqrt_val was computed at the beginning. \n\n  The original program2 also computes sqrt_val at the beginning. This is inefficient but correct? Actually, the factors we remove are primes, and the remaining n2 might have a factor larger than the original sqrt_val? But the condition at the end is: if after removing all factors up to sqrt_val, the remaining n2 is greater than 1, then it is prime -> so we add 1.\n\n  But the original program2 does:\n\n        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   // at the beginning\n\n        then iterates i from 2 to sqrt.\n\n        Then after the loop, if n>1, then answer++.\n\n  So we are consistent.\n\n  But note: the factorization loop might remove factors and then the value of n2 becomes smaller, so the condition i<=sqrt_val might be inefficient? But the original program2 does the same.\n\n  We'll leave it.\n\n  One more issue: the exponent_count might be negative? No, it's always nonnegative.\n\n  Now, the Fortran program.\n\n  However, note: the exponent_count is an integer, and we write it with format I20. That is 20 characters. Then we adjust left.\n\n  The string might have leading spaces? But we adjustl.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the btest function: it is for nonnegative integers. The bitmask is from 0 to 2**n-1, which is nonnegative.\n\n  Also, the number of books n is at least 1? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume n>=1.\n\n  However, if n=0, then the loop bitmask from 0 to 2**0-1=0. Then we do the empty subset.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: The exponentiation 2**n: if n is 12, then 2**12=4096, which is safe. But if n is large? The original Java program uses Math.pow(2, n) which is double. We are using integer exponentiation. But in Fortran, 2**n for n=30 would be 2^30 which is about 1e9, which is safe for integers? In 4-byte integers, 2**30 is 1e9 which is within 2e9. But if n>30? The problem says n, m up to 12? The original problem: n and m are at most 12. So we are safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n    program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: n, m, x\n        integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)\n        integer :: i, j, k, bitmask, min_cost, total\n        integer, parameter :: big = huge(0)\n        logical :: flag\n        integer(kind=8) :: n2\n        integer :: exponent_count, sqrt_val, count, jj\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        logical :: foundA, foundB\n        integer, allocatable :: res(:)\n\n        !

Then we check `n2>1` at the end. This is the same as the original.\n\n  However, the original program2 uses the same variable.\n\n  We'll test with n2=10: \n        Initially, n2=10\n        sqrt_val = int(sqrt(10.0)) = 3\n        i=2: \n            mod(10,2)==0 -> count=1, n2=5\n            then jj=1: count=1>=1 -> exponent_count=1, count=0 -> break inner while.\n        i=3: \n            mod(5,3) !=0 -> skip.\n        Then n2=5>1 -> exponent_count becomes 2.\n\n  Then the string is \"2\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\".\n\n  But the expected exponent_count for 10 is 2? The original program2: \n        n=10\n        i=2: count=1 -> then j=1: count-1=0 -> exponent_count=1, then j=2: 0-2<0 -> break.\n        then i=3: ... then at the end n=5>1 -> exponent_count=1+1=2.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  However, note: the inner loop for j in the original program2 is:\n\n        for (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) {\n            count -= j;\n            answer++;\n        }\n\n  We did:\n\n        jj=1\n        do while (count>=jj)\n            exponent_count = exponent_count+1\n            count = count - jj\n            jj = jj+1\n        end do\n\n  This is the same.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  But note: the condition in the original program2 for the factorization loop: i runs from 2 to sqrt (inclusive). We do the same.\n\n  Let me write the final code.\n\n  However, note: the mod function for large integers? We are using integer(kind=8) for n2, but i is integer(4). We convert i to kind=8 when doing mod.\n\n  We do: mod(n2, int(i, kind=8)) \n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Also, the division: n2 = n2 / i   -> i is integer(4). But Fortran will promote? We do: n2 = n2 / int(i, kind=8) to avoid overflow? Actually, the value of i is at most sqrt_val which is about 1e9? But the original min_cost is at most 120000, so n2 is at most 120000, then sqrt_val is at most about 346. So i is small.\n\n  Therefore, we can do: n2 = n2 / i   (without conversion) and it will be promoted to 8-byte.\n\n  But to be safe, we do: n2 = n2 / int(i, kind=8)\n\n  Alternatively, we can declare i as integer(kind=8) but then the loop variable? We can do:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: i   ! for the factorization loop?\n\n  But sqrt_val is integer(4). We can change:\n\n        sqrt_val = int(sqrt(real(n2, kind=8)), kind=8)   -> but no, the loop variable i from 2 to sqrt_val: sqrt_val is 4-byte.\n\n  Since n2 is at most 120000, then sqrt_val is about 346, so we can use 4-byte for i.\n\n  We'll leave it.\n\n  Final code:\n\n  Note: We must be cautious: the first program's matrix indices: the matrix a is n rows and m+1 columns.\n\n  And the understanding indices: the first element of the row is the cost, and then the next m elements are the understanding.\n\n  We are checking from k=2 to m+1? Actually, k=1 is the cost, k=2 to m+1 are the m understandings.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  We write the code accordingly."
