Actually, in Java dp has size n+1 and dp[n] is set to -1 initially but then we set dp[n-1] = a[n-1] and then for i from n-1 down to 0. We can do:\n\n                dp(n) = a(n) do i = n-1, 1, -1\n                    dp(i) = max(a(i), dp(i+1)) end do\n\n            Then for i=1 to n-1:\n                if (a(i) > dp(i+1)) then \n                    res1(i) = 0\n                else\n                    res1(i) = dp(i+1) - a(i) + 1\n                end if\n            For i=n: \n                Since in Java, when i=n-1 (0-indexed) the last element, then we use dp[i+1] which is dp[n] (0-indexed) but our dp for n is set? Actually, the Java program sets dp for indices 0 to n-1, and then when i = n-1, it uses dp[n] (which was set to -1 initially) but then overwritten? Actually, in the Java code:\n\n                dp[n-1] = a[n-1]   [for the last element]\n\n                Then for i from n-1 down to 0: \n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], a[i])\n\n                Then for i from 0 to n-1:\n                    if a[i] > dp[i+1] ... \n\n                But note: for i = n-1, we use dp[i+1] = dp[n], which was initialized to -1 and never overwritten? Actually, the loop for dp starts at i = n-1 and goes down to 0. For i=n-1, we set dp[n-1] = max(dp[n], a[n-1]). Since dp[n] is -1 and a[n-1] is at least 0, so dp[n-1] = a[n-1]. Then for i=n-2: we set dp[n-2] = max(dp[n-1], a[n-2]) = max(a[n-1], a[n-2]), etc. But note: the array `dp` is of size n+1, and the loop for i from n-1 down to 0: \n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], a[i]) So for i = n-1, we use dp[n] which is -1. Then we set dp[n-1] = max(-1, a[n-1]) = a[n-1]. Then for i=n-2, we set dp[n-2] = max(dp[n-1], a[n-2]) = max(a[n-1], a[n-2]), etc. Then when outputting for i from 0 to n-1:\n                    for i=0: use dp[1]\n                    for i=1: use dp[2]\n                    ...\n                    for i = n-1: use dp[n] (which is -1) -> but note: the array a has nonnegative numbers?

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The plan:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_581_B) reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` long integers.\n    Then it computes an array `dp` where `dp[i] = max(a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1])` for i from 0 to n-1, and `dp[n]` is not used in the same way.\n    Then it outputs for each element: if a[i] > dp[i+1] then 0 else (dp[i+1] - a[i] + 1).\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string and checks if it has exactly 2 distinct characters and each character appears exactly twice.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC164_D) reads a string of digits and counts the number of substrings that form numbers divisible by 2019.\n\n However, note the instruction: \n    - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n    - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n But the three programs are independent and each reads its own input. We are to chain them: the output of the first becomes the input of the second? \n Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n However, looking at the programs:\n   Program 1: reads an integer `n` and then `n` long integers, and outputs a list of numbers (space separated) and then a newline.\n   Program 2: reads a single string (without spaces) and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n   Program 3: reads a string of digits.\n\n The output of program 1 is a sequence of numbers (each as a string of digits) separated by spaces and ending with a newline.\n\n How to chain?\n   The output of program 1 must be the input to program 2? But program 2 expects a string that has exactly 4 characters (like \"AABB\")? \n   The output of program 1 is a list of numbers (for example, if n=3, it outputs three numbers). \n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact chaining. But note: the input to the entire sequence is the input to the first program, and the output of the entire sequence is the output of the last program.\n\n But the three programs are independent. They are not designed to be chained. \n\n Clarification: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. The output of the first program is the input to the second. The output of the second is the input to the third. The output of the third is the final output.\n\n However, the first program outputs numbers (which are integers) as a string of digits with spaces. The second program expects a string of exactly 4 characters? Actually, the second program counts the frequency of each character and expects two distinct characters each appearing twice. The example input to the second program is a string of 4 characters (like \"AABB\", \"ABAB\", etc.). \n\n The output of the first program is a sequence of numbers. For example, if the input to the first program is:\n   3\n   1 2 3\n Then the output of the first program is: \"0 1 0 \" (without quotes) but note the program prints:\n      for i=0: 0 and space, i=1: 1 and space, i=2: 0 and space, then a newline.\n\n So the entire output is \"0 1 0 \\n\". This is 7 characters. The second program will read the entire string (without the newline? or with?) and then check. But the second program uses `in.next()` which reads tokens (by default space delimited) but in this case the entire string is passed? Actually, in the second program, the input is read as a single token? But note the first program outputs multiple tokens.\n\n How to resolve?\n\n The problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n We must design the chain:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer `n` and then `n` long integers).\n   Step 2: Compute the output of the first program (a string of numbers and spaces) but do not output it. Instead, pass this string as the input to the second program.\n\n   Step 3: The second program takes a string. It will take the entire string (without the trailing newline? or with?) and then process it. But note: the second program expects a string of 4 characters? Actually, the second program does not specify the length. It just counts the frequency of each character. However, the example inputs are 4 characters. But the output of the first program is a string of variable length (depending on `n` and the numbers).\n\n   Step 4: The output of the second program is either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (with a newline). Then this string becomes the input to the third program? But the third program expects a string of digits. \n\n This chaining does not make sense. \n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n However, the three programs are from different problems and are not designed to be chained. The problem does not specify what the input to the entire chain is. \n\n But note: the instruction says \"when run on the same input\". The entire chain must be run on the same input that the first program originally took? Then the output of the entire chain is the output of the third program? \n\n But the input to the chain is the input to the first program. The output of the first program becomes the input to the second. The output of the second becomes the input to the third. The output of the third is the final output.\n\n However, the second and third programs are not designed to take the output of the previous program as valid input.\n\n We must reinterpret the problem: \n\n   We are to simulate the entire chain. The input to the entire Fortran program is the input that the first Java program would read. Then we run the first program's logic and capture its output as a string (without actually printing it). Then we use that string as the input to the second program. Then capture the output of the second program as a string and use that as the input to the third program. Then the Fortran program should output the same as the third program.\n\n However, the second program expects a string that has exactly two distinct characters each repeated twice. The output of the first program is a string of numbers and spaces. It is highly unlikely that this string would meet the condition of the second program. Similarly, the third program expects a string of digits, but the second program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is 3 or 2 characters? Actually, \"Yes\" is 3 and \"No\" is 2. And then the third program will process that? \n\n This seems arbitrary. \n\n But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". However, the behavior of the entire chain is defined by the chaining. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the three programs are independent and the entire chain runs all three on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After reconsideration: the problem does not specify the initial input for the entire chain. We must assume that the entire chain takes the same input as the first program? Then the second and third programs are run on the outputs of the previous programs.\n\n However, the example input for the first program is integers, for the second is a string, for the third is a string. They are incompatible.\n\n Therefore, we must assume that the problem has provided three separate programs and we are to run them in sequence, but the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and so on. The entire Fortran program should read the input for the first program, then process it through the three stages, and output the result of the third.\n\n How to handle:\n\n   We will design:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program: an integer `n` and then `n` long integers.\n\n      Step 2: Compute the output of the first program as a string (without actually printing it). We will form a string that has the numbers (as in the first program) separated by spaces and ending with a newline? But note the second program reads a token (by default without spaces? Actually, the second program uses `next()` which reads the next token (by default delimited by whitespace). However, the entire output of the first program is one string. But the second program reads one token? Then it will only read the first number? \n\n   This is problematic.\n\n   Alternatively, we can reinterpret the chaining as:\n\n        The entire output of the first program (as a string) is the input to the second program. The second program then reads the entire string (including spaces) as one string? \n\n   In Java, if we do:\n\n        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String s = in.next();\n\n   then `next()` reads the next token (without spaces). So the second program would only read the first token of the first program's output.\n\n   But the second program then converts the string to a char array and checks the frequency. So if the first program outputs \"0 1 0\", then the second program would only read \"0\" (the first token). This is not the entire output.\n\n   To fix, we would have to change the second program to read the entire line? But we are not allowed to change the Java code.\n\n   Therefore, the problem must be that the entire output of the first program (including spaces and the newline) is passed as the input to the second program. But the second program uses `next()` which only takes the first token.\n\n   This indicates that the chaining as described is not straightforward.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". In a typical shell pipeline:\n\n        java Program1 | java Program2 | java Program3\n\n   Then Program2 would read the entire output of Program1 as its standard input. And Program2's `in.next()` would read the first token. But that is not the entire string.\n\n   So the second program is not designed to take the entire output of the first program. \n\n   Given the confusion, I suspect the problem intended that we run the three programs independently on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   After reading the problem again: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n   So we must chain them. But we are allowed to reinterpret the input and output in Fortran as internal data.\n\n   We will:\n\n        Stage 1: Read the input for the first program: n and array a.\n\n        Stage 2: Compute the result of the first program: an array of numbers (for each index i: res[i] = 0 if a[i] > max(a[i+1..n-1]) else (max - a[i] + 1)). Then we form a string that is the entire output of the first program: each number converted to string, separated by space, and then a newline.\n\n        Stage 3: Use this string as the input to the second program. The second program will:\n                - Take the string and convert it to a char array? Actually, the second program counts frequency of each character in the entire string? But note: the second program uses `in.next()` which only takes the first token. However, the problem says we are to reproduce the same behavior of the chain. In the chain, the second program would only read the first token of the first program's output.\n\n        This leads to: the second program's input is the first token (a string of digits) from the first program's output.\n\n        Stage 4: The second program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (with a newline). Then this string becomes the input to the third program.\n\n        Stage 5: The third program reads a string of digits. But the output of the second program is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the third program would try to parse \"Yes\" as a string of digits? This would cause an exception? \n\n   This does not seem to be the intended chain.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the three programs are to be run independently on the same initial input? That is, the entire Fortran program reads the initial input (which is the input for the first program) and then runs all three programs on that same input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the chaining is as follows:\n\n        Input to the entire program: the input for the first program.\n        Then the output of the first program (as a string) is the input for the second program.\n        Then the output of the second program (as a string) is the input for the third program.\n        The entire program outputs the output of the third program.\n\n   But we must simulate the exact behavior of each program.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read the first input: integer n and an array a of n long integers.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the result of the first program: an array `res1` of n integers (or long integers) and form a string `s1` that is the concatenation of each element of `res1` converted to string, separated by space, and then a newline.\n\n        Step 3: Use `s1` as the input string for the second program. The second program will:\n                - Count the frequency of each character in the string `s1`? But note: the second program uses `in.next()` which by default uses whitespace as delimiter. So it will read the first token of `s1` (which is the first number as a string). Then the rest of the string (including the next space and subsequent numbers) is not read.\n\n        Step 4: The second program checks if in that token (which is a string) there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n        Step 5: The second program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then a newline. We capture this as a string `s2`.\n\n        Step 6: Use `s2` as the input to the third program. The third program reads a string of digits. But `s2` is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are not digits. This will cause the third program to crash? Or the third program will process the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" as a string of digits? The third program does:\n\n                int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n            This will subtract the character '0'. For 'Y' (which is 89) minus '0' (48) gives 41, which is a number. Similarly, 'e' is 101 -> 101-48=53, etc. So it will process the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" as a sequence of digits? But these are not digits. However, the program will run without crashing, but the result is not meaningful.\n\n   This is not the same as running the three programs independently on the same initial input.\n\n   Given the confusion, I think there might be a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence, each on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   I think the safest is to ask for clarification, but since we cannot, we must make an assumption.\n\n   Let's assume that the entire chain is run on the initial input of the first program, and then the output of the first program is the input to the second, and so on.\n\n   We will implement the chain as described, even if the results are not meaningful.\n\n   Steps in Fortran:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial input: an integer `n`, and then `n` long integers (as the array `a`).\n\n        Step 2: Compute the first program's result:\n\n                Allocate an array `dp` of size `n` (or n+1) and compute:\n                    dp(n) = a(n)   ! if we index from 1 to n\n                    for i from n-1 down to 1: dp(i) = max( dp(i+1), a(i) )\n                Then for i from 1 to n:\n                    if (a(i) > dp(i+1)) then \n                        res1(i) = 0\n                    else\n                        res1(i) = dp(i+1) - a(i) + 1\n                    end if\n\n                Then we form a string `s1` that contains the values of `res1` converted to strings, separated by space, and then a newline.\n\n        Step 3: Process the second program with input string `s1`:\n\n                We note that the second program reads the first token from the input (which is the first word in `s1`). We can extract the first token from `s1` (by taking the first contiguous non-space characters). Let this token be `token1`.\n\n                Then we count the frequency of each character in `token1`.\n\n                If the number of distinct characters in `token1` is exactly 2 and each distinct character appears exactly twice, then the second program would output \"Yes\", else \"No\". We form a string `s2` = \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then append a newline.\n\n        Step 4: Process the third program with input string `s2` (without the newline? or with? In Java, the newline is part of the string? The third program reads with `sc.next()`, which would read the next token? But `s2` is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then a newline. The `next()` method would read the token without the newline? Actually, the newline is a delimiter. So the third program would read the token \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the newline is left in the input stream? But there is no more data. \n\n                However, the third program does:\n\n                    String S = sc.next();\n\n                So `S` is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then it processes that string.\n\n                Steps for the third program:\n\n                    Let N = len_trim(S)   ! the length of the token\n                    We then compute an array `mod_arr` of length N, and an array `mod_cnt` of size 0 to 2018 (initialized to 0).\n\n                    We iterate from the last character to the first (i from 0 to N-1 in the original Java, but we can do from 1 to N in Fortran, but note the indexing).\n\n                    We use a variable `radix` initialized to 1.\n\n                    For each character in `S` from last to first:\n\n                        digit = ichar(S(j:j)) - ichar('0')   ! but the string is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so this will give non-digit values.\n\n                    Then we compute:\n\n                        tmp = digit * radix mod 2019\n                        if i>0 then tmp = (tmp + mod_arr(i-1)) mod 2019\n                        mod_arr(i) = tmp\n                        mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                        radix = (radix * 10) mod 2019\n\n                    Then we do:\n\n                        mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1   [Note: the Java program does: mod_cnt[0]++ at the end]\n\n                    Then we compute:\n\n                        ans = 0\n                        do i = 0, 2018\n                            ans = ans + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n                        end do\n\n                    Then we output `ans`.\n\n        Step 5: The entire Fortran program should output `ans`.\n\n   But note: this is a very odd chain and the final answer will be based on processing the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" as if it were digits.\n\n   Given the problem statement, we have to do it.\n\n   However, I suspect the problem intended that the three programs are run on the same initial input independently, and then the entire chain output is the output of the third program? But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next.\n\n   Let me look at the original problem of each program:\n\n        Program1: from a Codeforces problem, it's about calculating the required value for each element.\n        Program2: from Atcoder, it's about checking if a string has exactly two distinct characters, each twice.\n        Program3: from Atcoder, it's about counting the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\n   They are unrelated. \n\n   Given the instructions, we must chain them as described.\n\n   Implementation details:\n\n        We will read the initial input: \n            read(*,*) n\n            allocate(a(n))\n            read(*,*) (a(i), i=1, n)\n\n        Step 2: Compute the first program's logic.\n\n        We will use 1-indexing in Fortran.\n\n        Note: the Java program uses 0-indexed arrays.\n\n        In Java:\n            dp[n-1] = a[n-1]\n            for i from n-2 down to 0: dp[i] = max(a[i], dp[i+1])\n\n            Then for i from 0 to n-1:\n                if a[i] > dp[i+1] then output 0\n                else output (dp[i+1] - a[i] + 1)\n\n        In Fortran:\n\n            allocate(dp(n+1))   ! we'll index dp from 1 to n, and dp(n+1) is not used in the same way? Actually, in Java dp has size n+1 and dp[n] is set to -1 initially but then we set dp[n-1] = a[n-1] and then for i from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                dp(n) = a(n)\n                do i = n-1, 1, -1\n                    dp(i) = max(a(i), dp(i+1))\n                end do\n\n            Then for i=1 to n-1:\n                if (a(i) > dp(i+1)) then \n                    res1(i) = 0\n                else\n                    res1(i) = dp(i+1) - a(i) + 1\n                end if\n            For i=n: \n                Since in Java, when i=n-1 (0-indexed) the last element, then we use dp[i+1] which is dp[n] (0-indexed) but our dp for n is set? Actually, the Java program sets dp for indices 0 to n-1, and then when i = n-1, it uses dp[n] (which was set to -1 initially) but then overwritten? \n\n            Actually, in the Java code:\n\n                dp[n-1] = a[n-1]   [for the last element]\n\n                Then for i from n-1 down to 0: \n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], a[i])\n\n                Then for i from 0 to n-1:\n                    if a[i] > dp[i+1] ... \n\n                But note: for i = n-1, we use dp[i+1] = dp[n], which was initialized to -1 and never overwritten? Actually, the loop for dp starts at i = n-1 and goes down to 0. For i=n-1, we set dp[n-1] = max(dp[n], a[n-1]). Since dp[n] is -1 and a[n-1] is at least 0, so dp[n-1] = a[n-1]. Then for i=n-2: we set dp[n-2] = max(dp[n-1], a[n-2]) = max(a[n-1], a[n-2]), etc.\n\n                But note: the array `dp` is of size n+1, and the loop for i from n-1 down to 0: \n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], a[i])\n\n                So for i = n-1, we use dp[n] which is -1. Then we set dp[n-1] = max(-1, a[n-1]) = a[n-1]. Then for i=n-2, we set dp[n-2] = max(dp[n-1], a[n-2]) = max(a[n-1], a[n-2]), etc.\n\n                Then when outputting for i from 0 to n-1:\n                    for i=0: use dp[1]\n                    for i=1: use dp[2]\n                    ...\n                    for i = n-1: use dp[n] (which is -1) -> but note: the array a has nonnegative numbers? So a[n-1] > -1, so it outputs 0? \n\n                However, the problem states: \n                    \"if a[i] > dp[i+1] then output 0 else output (dp[i+1] - a[i] + 1)\"\n\n                But for the last element, we are comparing a[n-1] and dp[n] (which is -1). Since a[n-1] is nonnegative, it will be greater, so output 0.\n\n                But what if the numbers can be negative? The problem says \"long integers\", so they can be negative.\n\n                So we must do as the Java program.\n\n            In Fortran, we'll set:\n\n                dp(n+1) = -1   ! because Java initializes dp[n] to -1 (which is the last element of the dp array of size n+1, index n in Java is the last)\n\n                do i = n, 1, -1\n                    dp(i) = max(dp(i+1), a(i))\n                end do\n\n                Then for i=1 to n:\n                    if (a(i) > dp(i+1)) then\n                        res1(i) = 0\n                    else\n                        res1(i) = dp(i+1) - a(i) + 1\n                    end if\n\n        Step 3: Form the string `s1` for the output of the first program.\n\n                We will create a string that contains the n numbers of `res1` converted to strings, separated by a space, and then a newline.\n\n                How to convert integers to strings? We can use internal writes.\n\n                Example:\n\n                    character(len=2000) :: s1   ! we need to estimate the length: each number might be up to 20 digits, and n up to ...? \n                    But the problem does not specify n. We can use a large buffer or use a loop to form the string.\n\n                Alternatively, we can write each number to a temporary string and then concatenate.\n\n                We'll do:\n\n                    s1 = ''\n                    do i=1, n\n                        write(str, *) res1(i)   ! this will write the number with a leading space for positive?\n                        ! we want to remove the leading space? Or we can use trim(adjustl(str))?\n                        ! but note: the Java program prints without any extra space at the beginning? It does: pw.print( ... \" \")\n\n                    Actually, the Java program prints: \n                         for i: number and then a space.\n\n                    So we can do:\n\n                        if (i==1) then\n                            write(s1, '(i0)') res1(i)\n                        else\n                            temp_str = ''\n                            write(temp_str, '(i0)') res1(i)\n                            s1 = trim(s1) // ' ' // trim(temp_str)\n                        end if\n\n                    Then at the end: s1 = trim(s1) // new_line('a')\n\n                But we don't know the maximum length. We can use a character array with sufficient length.\n\n        Step 4: Extract the first token from `s1` for the second program.\n\n                We can find the first non-space character and then the next space.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `index` to find the first space.\n\n                Let `token1` be the substring from the first non-space to the next space (or end if no space).\n\n                How about:\n\n                    read(s1, *) token1   ! this reads the first token? But we want to keep the entire string for later? \n\n                We can do:\n\n                    pos1 = 1\n                    do while (s1(pos1:pos1) == ' ' .and. pos1 <= len_trim(s1))\n                        pos1 = pos1+1\n                    end do\n                    pos2 = index(s1(pos1:), ' ') \n                    if (pos2 == 0) then\n                        token1 = s1(pos1:)\n                    else\n                        token1 = s1(pos1:pos1+pos2-2)\n                    end if\n\n                But an easier way: we can read the first token using internal read:\n\n                    read(s1, *) token1   ! token1 will be the first token\n\n                However, we don't know the length of the token. We can declare token1 as a string of sufficient length.\n\n        Step 5: Count frequency in `token1`:\n\n                We'll use an array or a map. But Fortran does not have a built-in hash map for characters. We know the token is a string of digits (from the first program's output) so the characters are digits and possibly minus sign? \n\n                But note: the first program outputs nonnegative integers. So the token is a string of digits (no minus).\n\n                However, the first program outputs 0 or a positive integer. So the token is composed of digits only.\n\n                We can use an array of integers for counts of each character? But the character set is small: '0' to '9'. But the token might be long? \n\n                We'll do:\n\n                    integer :: count(0:255)   ! for all ASCII, but we can do by integer representation\n                    or better: we can use an array indexed by the character value.\n\n                    integer :: freq(0:255) = 0   ! initialize to 0\n\n                    do i = 1, len_trim(token1)\n                        c = token1(i:i)\n                        ic = ichar(c)\n                        freq(ic) = freq(ic) + 1\n                    end do\n\n                Then we count the distinct characters that have freq>0. And also check if each such character has frequency 2.\n\n                However, note: the second program does:\n\n                    for each entry in the map: if the frequency is not 2, then set ok = false.\n\n                    then if (ok and the map size is 2) then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n                We'll do:\n\n                    distinct = 0\n                    allTwo = .true.\n                    do i = 0, 255\n                        if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                            distinct = distinct + 1\n                            if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                                allTwo = .false.\n                            end if\n                        end if\n                    end do\n\n                    if (allTwo .and. distinct==2) then\n                        s2 = 'Yes' // new_line('a')\n                    else\n                        s2 = 'No' // new_line('a')\n                    end if\n\n        Step 6: Process the third program with input string = s2 (but without the newline? Or including the newline? The third program uses `sc.next()`, which reads the next token. The token in s2 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the newline is a delimiter. So the third program will read the token without the newline.\n\n                Therefore, we should use the string without the trailing newline? Or we can use the entire s2? \n\n                The Java program reads the token, so we can take the first token of s2? But s2 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then a newline. The newline is a delimiter. So the token is the word without the newline.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    read(s2, *) token2   ! to get the first token\n\n                But then we use token2 as the input string for the third program.\n\n        Step 7: Run the third program on the string token2.\n\n                Let S = token2\n                Let N = len_trim(S)\n\n                We'll compute:\n\n                    mod_arr(0) = 0   ! but we are going to index from 1 to N\n                    We need an array mod_arr of size N (we can index 1..N) and mod_cnt(0:2018) = 0.\n\n                    radix = 1\n                    do i = 1, N   ! i from 1 to N: we process the string from last character to first? \n                         But the Java program processes from last character to first (i=0 to N-1 in Java corresponds to the last character to the first).\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                         do i = 1, N\n                            j = N - i + 1   ! j goes from N down to 1: we process the j-th character of S (from last to first)\n\n                            digit = ichar(S(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n                            ! But note: the Java program does: \n                            !   int tmp = (digit) * radix % 2019\n                            !   if (i != 0) then tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019   [here i is the index in the reversed processing]\n\n                    We are going to build the array mod_arr for positions 1 to N.\n\n                    We can define:\n\n                         mod_arr(i) = (digit * radix) % 2019\n                         if (i > 1) then   ! because the first in the reversed order (i=1) has no previous\n                             mod_arr(i) = (mod_arr(i) + mod_arr(i-1)) % 2019\n                         end if\n\n                    But wait, in the Java program:\n\n                         i=0: the last character of S -> index = N-1 in Java (0-indexed) -> in Fortran: j = N\n                         mod_arr[0] = (digit * radix) % 2019   [if i=0, no addition]\n\n                         i=1: the second last character -> j = N-1\n                         mod_arr[1] = (digit * radix + mod_arr[0]) % 2019\n\n                    So we can do:\n\n                         do i = 1, N   ! i is the position in the mod_arr array (which is the same as the index in the reversed order)\n                             j = N - i + 1   ! so for i=1, j=N; i=2, j=N-1, etc.\n\n                             digit = ichar(S(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n                             temp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n                             if (i > 1) then\n                                 temp = mod(temp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n                             end if\n\n                             mod_arr(i) = temp\n                             mod_cnt(temp) = mod_cnt(temp) + 1\n\n                             radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n\n                         end do\n\n                    Then we do:\n\n                         mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1   ! the Java program does this after the loop.\n\n                    Then compute:\n\n                         ans = 0\n                         do i = 0, 2018\n                             nci = mod_cnt(i)\n                             ans = ans + nci*(nci-1)/2\n                         end do\n\n        Step 8: Output `ans`\n\n   However, note: the Java program uses a radix that is a power of 10 mod 2019. And the mod_arr is the suffix mod value: \n        for the substring from the last character to the current character.\n\n   But the above does not match exactly: the Java program does:\n\n        for i in [0, N-1]:\n            index = N-1-i   (because they do S.charAt(N-1-i))\n            digit = S[N-1-i] - '0'\n            tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019\n            if i != 0: \n                tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n            mod_arr[i] = tmp\n            mod_cnt[tmp]++\n            radix = (radix * 10) % 2019\n\n        Then mod_arr[0] corresponds to the last digit.\n\n   We are doing:\n\n        i=1: j=N -> last digit -> same as Java i=0.\n\n        i=2: j=N-1 -> same as Java i=1.\n\n        So mod_arr(1) in Fortran = mod_arr[0] in Java.\n        mod_arr(2) in Fortran = mod_arr[1] in Java.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            if i>1 (i>=2) then we add mod_arr(i-1) which is mod_arr(1) for i=2 -> which is Java mod_arr[0]. This matches.\n\n        So the algorithm is the same.\n\n   But note: the third program then does:\n\n        mod_cnt[0]++   // in Java\n\n        This is to account for the empty suffix? Actually, the Java program does:\n\n            mod_cnt[0]++;   // This is after the loop.\n\n        Why? Because they are counting pairs of indices (i, j) such that the substring from i to j is divisible by 2019. They use the trick that if the same mod appears at two different positions, then the substring between them is divisible. And they also consider the substring that is divisible by itself? Actually, the empty substring is not considered. \n\n        The explanation: they are counting the pairs (i, j) (i < j) such that the mod value at i-1 and j are the same? But then they do:\n\n            ans = 0\n            for each mod value: ans += C(count,2)\n\n        And then they add mod_cnt[0]? Actually, they do:\n\n            mod_cnt[0]++;   // and then for every mod value (including 0) they do C(count,2)\n\n        The reason: if the mod value is 0 at a position, then the substring from the beginning to that position is divisible. But the Java program does not explicitly have a starting point at -1? \n\n        We'll do the same: after the loop, do:\n\n            mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n        Then compute the combinations.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        We'll write a Fortran program that:\n\n            Step 1: Reads n and the array a.\n\n            Step 2: Computes the dp array and the result array for the first program.\n\n            Step 3: Forms a string s1 of the result array (space separated) and then a newline.\n\n            Step 4: Extracts the first token from s1 (which is the first word) into token1.\n\n            Step 5: Counts the frequency of each character in token1, and then sets s2 to \"Yes\" or \"No\" with a newline.\n\n            Step 6: Extracts the first token from s2 (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") into token2.\n\n            Step 7: Runs the third program on token2.\n\n            Step 8: Outputs the answer from the third program.\n\n   Note: The program might be inefficient for large inputs, but we assume n is small? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n   We must be cautious with array sizes:\n\n        The array `mod_cnt` has size 0:2018 -> 2019 elements.\n\n        The array `mod_arr` has size N (the length of token2) which is either 3 (\"Yes\") or 2 (\"No\"). So it's small.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: max_len_string = 100000   ! for s1, but we are only taking the first token, which might be up to 20 digits? \n        But to be safe, we use dynamic allocation for strings? Or we can use very long strings.\n\n        We'll assume the first token has at most 100 characters.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            !

Step 8: output ans\n            write(*,*) ans\n\n            end program\n\n   However, note: the Java program uses `long` for `ans`. We'll use integer(kind=8) for ans if the numbers might be large? \n\n   The maximum value: the number of substrings? The third program: the maximum number of pairs for a given mod value is about (n*(n-1))/2, where n is the length of the string? But our string is only 2 or 3 characters. So the maximum mod_cnt[i] is at most 3? So ans is small.\n\n   But to be safe, we use:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: ans8\n            ans8 = 0\n            do i=0, 2018\n                if (mod_cnt(i) >= 2) then\n                    ans8 = ans8 + int(mod_cnt(i),8)*(int(mod_cnt(i)-1,8))/2\n                end if\n            end do\n            write(*,*) ans8\n\n   But the problem says the third program uses `long ans` in Java. We'll do:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: ans = 0\n\n   But the numbers are small, so integer(4) would suffice. But to be safe.\n\n   Also note: the digit might be negative? Only if the character is not a digit. But our token2 is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the digits are not digits. We are subtracting '0'. For 'Y' (89) - 48 = 41, which is positive. So no problem.\n\n   Let's run a small example:\n\n        Input to the entire program: \n           3\n           1 2 3\n\n        Step 2: \n            a = [1,2,3]\n            dp(4) = -1\n            dp(3) = max(dp(4), a(3)) = max(-1,3)=3\n            dp(2) = max(dp(3),2)=3\n            dp(1) = max(dp(2),1)=3\n\n            res1(1)=0 because a(1)=1 and dp(2)=3 -> 1<=3 -> res1(1)=3-1+1=3? \n            But wait: in Java, for i=0: a[0]=1, dp[1]=3 -> so output 3? \n\n            Then the output of the first program is \"3 1 0\" (with spaces and newline).\n\n        Step 4: token1 = \"3\"\n\n        Step 5: \n            token1 = \"3\" -> one character '3'\n            freq(ichar('3'))=1 -> distinct=1, and it is not 2 -> so s2=\"No\" with newline.\n\n        Step 6: token2 = \"No\"\n\n        Step 7: \n            S3=\"No\", N3=2\n            i=1: j=2 (the last character) -> character 'o'\n                digit = 'o' (111) - 48 = 63\n                temp = (63 * 1) mod 2019 = 63\n                mod_arr(1)=63, mod_cnt(63)=1\n                radix = 10 mod 2019 = 10\n\n            i=2: j=1 -> character 'N' -> ascii 78 -> digit=78-48=30\n                temp = (30 * 10) mod 2019 = 300 mod 2019 = 300\n                then add mod_arr(1)=63 -> 300+63=363 mod 2019=363\n                mod_arr(2)=363, mod_cnt(363)=1\n                radix = 10*10=100 mod 2019=100\n\n            Then mod_cnt(0) becomes 1 (so mod_cnt(0)=1, mod_cnt(63)=1, mod_cnt(363)=1)\n\n            Then we do:\n                mod_cnt(0)=1 -> pairs: 0\n                mod_cnt(63)=1 -> 0\n                mod_cnt(363)=1 -> 0\n            ans = 0\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n   This is the result.\n\n   But note: the third program in the original would be run on the string \"No\", and we are simulating that.\n\n   We'll write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" So we are not doing any I/O until the last step.\n\n   We are only using internal writes and reads.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We are using internal reads to extract tokens. This is acceptable.\n\n   We'll write the program as described.\n\n   One more thing: the first program in Java uses long integers. We use integer(kind=8) for a, dp, res1.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: n   ? But the first read is for n, which is an integer. The problem says: int n. So we can use integer for n.\n\n        But the array a is long in Java -> 8-byte integers.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        integer :: n   ! for the size\n        integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:), dp(:), res1(:)\n\n   For the rest, we use default integers (4-byte) for counting and indices, but for the numbers in the first program we use 8-byte.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Let's write the code."
