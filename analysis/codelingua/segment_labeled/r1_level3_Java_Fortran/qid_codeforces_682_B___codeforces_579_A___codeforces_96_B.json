  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The input is read only at the beginning (from the first program) and output is written at the end (from the last program).\n However, note that the second and third programs also read from stdin. But according to the instructions, we must not have I/O in the middle.\n\n We have to chain the outputs:\n   Program1: reads n and a list of n integers, then outputs a single integer (c).\n   Program2: reads an integer (which is the output of Program1) and outputs the number of ones in its binary representation.\n   Program3: reads a long integer (which is the output of Program2) and outputs a super lucky number (>= the input).\n\n But note: the original chain would be:\n   Input for the chain: the input for the first program (n and n integers)\n   Then the output of the first program (c) becomes the input for the second program.\n   Then the output of the second program (the count of ones) becomes the input for the third program.\n   Then the third program outputs the super lucky number.\n\n However, the third program in the given code expects a long integer. The output of the second program is an integer (count of ones) which is small.\n\n Steps:\n  1. We read the input for the first program: an integer n, and then n integers.\n  2. We process the first program: sort the list, and then compute c (which is the mex-like value).\n  3. The value of c becomes the input for the second program: we compute the number of ones in the binary representation of c.\n  4. The count (let's call it cnt) becomes the input for the third program: we find the smallest super lucky number (with equal number of 4 and 7) that is >= cnt.\n\n But note: the third program uses a while loop that starts from a mask (beginning with 2) and increases until the generated number (of even length, with half 4's and half 7's) is >= the input.\n\n However, the third program in the provided code does not exactly do that? Let me explain:\n\n   It uses a mask starting at 2 (which in binary is \"10\") and then takes the substring from index 1 (so the first character is skipped). \n   Then it checks if the number of zeros equals the number of ones? Actually, it checks if zeros = length - zeros -> meaning zeros = ones? Then it replaces 0 by 4 and 1 by 7.\n\n   This method generates numbers of even length (since the mask starts at 2: \"10\" -> substring(1) gives \"0\", then mask=3: \"11\" -> substring(1) gives \"1\", then mask=4: \"100\" -> substring(1) gives \"00\", mask=5: \"101\"->\"01\", etc.). But note the length of the binary string without the first bit is increasing.\n\n   Actually, the mask is incremented and then converted to a binary string without the first character. This generates all binary strings of length = (number of bits of mask - 1). And then we require that the number of zeros equals the number of ones? Actually, that would require that the string has even length and exactly half zeros? But the length of the string is mask_bits-1. For mask=2: length=1 -> zeros=1? then ones=0 -> not equal. So it skips. Then mask=3: length=1 -> same. Then mask=4: \"100\" -> substring(1) is \"00\" -> zeros=2, ones=0 -> not equal. Then mask=5: \"101\" -> substring(1) is \"01\" -> zeros=1, ones=1 -> equal. Then we get: replace 0 by 4 and 1 by 7 -> becomes \"47\". Then value=47.\n\n   The algorithm in the third program: it generates numbers in increasing order of length? Actually, the mask increases so the binary string (without the first bit) increases in length as the mask grows. But note: the numbers generated are in lex order of the binary string? But the binary string is being generated for increasing mask, which is increasing numerically? However, the generated numbers (after replacing 0->4, 1->7) are not necessarily in increasing numerical order? Actually, they are: because the string length increases, and then within the same length, we are generating in increasing order of the binary number (mask is increasing). So the numbers generated are in increasing order? But note: the same length: mask=5: \"01\" -> \"47\", mask=6: \"10\" -> \"74\", mask=7: \"11\" -> \"77\", then mask=8: \"000\" -> \"444\", mask=9: \"001\" -> \"447\", ... etc.\n\n   But the problem: we are looking for the smallest super lucky number (which has equal number of 4 and 7) that is >= the input. The algorithm in the third program starts from the smallest mask (2) and goes until the generated number is >= the input. That will be the answer.\n\n   However, note: the third program expects a long integer as input? But the output of the second program is an integer (the count of ones) which is small. So we can represent it as a long integer without problem.\n\n Plan for Fortran:\n\n  We'll do:\n\n    Step 1: Read n and the list of integers (from the first program).\n    Step 2: Process the list to compute c (as in the first program).\n    Step 3: From the second program: take c and compute the number of ones in its binary representation (which is the same as the population count). Let this be cnt.\n    Step 4: From the third program: take cnt and find the smallest super lucky number (with equal number of 4 and 7) that is >= cnt.\n\n  Then output that super lucky number.\n\n  Note: The third program uses a while loop that starts from mask=2 and goes until the generated value is >= the input. We must do the same.\n\n  How to generate the number from the mask in Fortran?\n    We can convert the mask to a binary string? But note: in Fortran, we don't have a direct equivalent of Integer.toBinaryString. However, we can generate the binary representation by repeatedly dividing by 2? But note: we want to skip the first bit? Actually, the mask is an integer that we increment. We can compute the length of the binary representation of mask, then take the substring from 2 to the end? Actually, the Java code: Integer.toBinaryString(mask) returns a string without leading zeros? Then we take substring(1) which skips the first character.\n\n    Example: mask=5 -> binary \"101\" -> substring(1) is \"01\".\n\n    How to do that in Fortran? We can generate the binary representation of mask without the leading '1'? Actually, we want to generate the binary representation of mask, then remove the first character? But note: the mask starts at 2 -> binary \"10\" -> remove first character -> \"0\". Then mask=3 -> \"11\" -> \"1\", mask=4 -> \"100\" -> \"00\", mask=5 -> \"101\" -> \"01\", etc.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note that the mask is being incremented and we are effectively generating all binary strings of length L (for L starting at 1 and increasing) by starting at 2^L and going up to 2^(L+1)-1? Actually, the binary representation of mask (without the leading '1') is the same as the binary representation of (mask - 2^L) in L bits? Actually, the mask starts at 2 (which is 10 in binary) and then we remove the first character? So we are generating the binary numbers of L bits for L=1, then L=2, then L=3, etc. But the mask goes continuously: L= floor(log2(mask))? Actually, the length of the binary string of mask is k, then the substring is of length k-1? So we are generating all binary strings of length k-1? And k increases as mask increases.\n\n    We can generate the binary representation of mask, then remove the first character? But we can also generate the binary representation for the number (mask - 2^(k-1)) in k-1 bits? Actually, that is exactly what we have: the mask is represented in k bits, and the first bit is always 1? Then the rest k-1 bits is the binary representation of (mask - 2^(k-1)).\n\n    However, we can avoid string manipulation? We can use bit operations? But note: we need to count zeros and ones? And then form a number by replacing 0 by 4 and 1 by 7? It might be easier to use a string.\n\n    Steps for the third part:\n\n      Let mask = 2 (as an integer)\n      Let value = 0 (as a long integer)\n      We are going to iterate until value >= cnt (which is the input to the third program, the population count from step2)\n\n      In each iteration:\n        Convert mask to a binary string without the leading '1'. How to get the binary representation without the leading one?\n          First, find the position of the highest set bit? Let k = bit_length(mask)  [the number of bits needed to represent mask]\n          Then the binary string of mask has k bits. We want the substring from bit 2 to k? In Fortran, we can generate the binary representation of mask, then take a substring from index 2 to the end.\n\n        But note: the mask starts at 2 -> k=2 -> binary \"10\" -> we take from index2: which is only one character? How? In Fortran, if we have a string of \"10\", then we can take s(2:2) -> which is '0'. For mask=3: \"11\" -> s(2:2) -> '1'. For mask=4: \"100\" -> s(2:3) -> \"00\".\n\n        How to generate the binary representation? We can write a function to convert an integer to a binary string of length (without leading zeros) and then remove the first character? But note: we want to remove the first character? Actually, we can compute the length of the binary representation of mask, then form the string for mask without the first bit? Alternatively, we can generate the binary representation for mask and then take the substring from 2 to the end.\n\n        Steps for converting an integer to a binary string:\n\n          We can do:\n            k = bit_size(mask)  -> but that gives the total bits? Actually, we can use bit_len = floor(log(real(mask))/log(2.0)) + 1   [if mask>0]\n          Then we can form a string of length bit_len by processing the bits from the highest to the lowest? Actually, we can do:\n\n          Alternatively, we can generate the binary representation by repeatedly taking the modulus by 2? But that gives the bits in reverse? Then we reverse? And then remove the first character? Actually, the mask is at least 2, so the first bit is always 1? Then we can skip the first bit? Actually, we can generate the bits without the leading one by:\n\n            Let s = \"\"\n            Let temp = mask\n            Let bit_len = 0\n            We can compute the bit length? Then set the string to be of length bit_len-1? Actually, we can do:\n\n            We can do:\n\n              bit_len = 0\n              temp = mask\n              do while (temp > 0)\n                 bit_len = bit_len + 1\n                 temp = ishft(temp, -1)  ! shift right by 1\n              end do\n\n            Then we form a string of length = bit_len-1? Actually, we want the bits from the second highest to the lowest? We can:\n\n              temp = mask\n              ! Clear the highest bit? Then the remaining value is in the lower (bit_len-1) bits?\n              Then we can set: temp2 = mask - 2**(bit_len-1)   [because the highest bit is 2^(bit_len-1)]\n\n            Then we convert temp2 to a binary string of length = bit_len-1? And then we can count the zeros and ones in that string? But note: the string might have leading zeros? Actually, we want to represent it in exactly bit_len-1 bits? Then we pad with zeros on the left? Then we can form a string of length bit_len-1 by:\n\n              do i = bit_len-1, 1, -1\n                 if (btest(temp2, i-1)) then ... but note: the bit positions? Actually, we can do:\n\n            Alternatively, we can generate the bits without the leading one by:\n\n              s = \"\"\n              temp = mask\n              first = .true.\n              do while (temp > 0)\n                 bit = iand(temp, 1)\n                 temp = ishft(temp, -1)\n                 if (first) then\n                    first = .false.   ! skip the first bit (which is the highest, but we are going from low to high? Actually, we are going from low to high, but then we reverse? So the first bit we get is the lowest? This doesn't work.\n\n            This might be messy.\n\n        Instead, we can generate the full binary string for mask and then take the substring from the second character to the end? That might be easier.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let s = \"\"\n          temp = mask\n          do i = bit_len-1, 0, -1\n             if (btest(temp, i)) then\n                 s = trim(s) // '1'\n             else\n                 s = trim(s) // '0'\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          Then we take s(2:bit_len) as our string? Actually, the first character is at index 1? Then we take s(2:bit_len) for the substring without the first character.\n\n        But note: the mask starts at 2 -> bit_len=2 -> s = \"10\", then we take s(2:2) -> \"0\". For mask=4: bit_len=3 -> s=\"100\", then s(2:3)=\"00\".\n\n        Then we count the number of '0' and the total length? Then if the number of zeros equals the total length - zeros (i.e., half the length) then we form the number by replacing '0' by '4' and '1' by '7'. Then convert that string to a long integer.\n\n        Then we set value = that long integer.\n\n        Then we check if value >= cnt? Then we break? Then output value.\n\n        Then mask = mask + 1\n\n      We have to be cautious: the integer mask might become large? But note: the input cnt is the population count of the integer c (from the first program). The value of c is at most n+1 (from the first program) and n is the input size? The first program reads n (which can be up to 100,000) so c is at most 100,001. Then the population count of c is at most about 17 (because 2^17=131072). So cnt is at most 17. Therefore, the third program will run very quickly: it will generate super lucky numbers until it finds one >= 17. The smallest super lucky number that is >=17 is 44? Actually, the super lucky numbers: 47, 74, 4477, 4747, ... but wait: 44 is not super lucky? Because it has two 4's and zero 7's -> not equal. The next is 47? Then 74? Then 4477? Actually, 47 is 47 -> 47>=17? So it will break at the first one? So the answer for the third program when input is 17 is 47.\n\n      But note: the third program in the original code starts at mask=2 and then mask=3,4,5... until it finds one. When cnt=17, mask=5: the binary string for mask=5 is \"101\" -> substring(1) is \"01\" -> which has one zero and one one -> so it forms \"47\", and 47>=17 -> then output 47.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n    We'll write the Fortran program with:\n\n      Step 1: Read n and the list of n integers.\n\n      Step 2: Sort the list and compute c (as in the first program).\n\n      Step 3: Compute the population count of c (the number of ones in its binary representation). We can do by repeatedly shifting and counting.\n\n      Step 4: Set cnt = popcount(c)\n\n      Step 5: Then we do:\n\n          mask = 2\n          value = 0\n          found = .false.\n\n          do while (.not. found)\n             ! Compute the bit length of mask\n             if (mask == 0) then\n                 bit_len = 1\n             else\n                 temp = mask\n                 bit_len = 0\n                 do while (temp > 0)\n                    bit_len = bit_len + 1\n                    temp = ishft(temp, -1)\n                 end do\n             end if\n\n             ! Now, form the full binary string of mask (without leading zeros) of length = bit_len\n             allocate(character(len=bit_len) :: bin_str\n             temp = mask\n             do i = bit_len, 1, -1\n                 if (btest(temp, i-1)) then   ! bit numbering: from 0 to bit_len-1? The highest bit is at position i=bit_len-1?

Count zeros and ones in s?\n             zeros = 0\n             ones = 0\n             do i = 1, len_s\n                 if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n                     zeros = zeros + 1\n                 else\n                     ones = ones + 1\n                 end if\n             end do\n\n             ! Check if zeros == ones? And note: the total length is even? Actually, zeros+ones = len_s, so we require zeros == len_s/2? But len_s must be even? If not, skip.\n             if (mod(len_s,2) == 0 .and. zeros == ones) then\n                 ! Form the number: replace '0' by '4', '1' by '7'\n                 do i = 1, len_s\n                     if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n                         s(i:i) = '4'\n                     else\n                         s(i:i) = '7'\n                     end if\n                 end do\n\n                 ! Convert s to an integer? But note: the number might be large? The original Java used Long. So we use a Fortran integer of kind=8? Or we can use read(s,*) to a integer(kind=8)\n                 read(s, *) value   ! But note: s might be empty? Then we set value=0? But if len_s=0 then s is empty -> read will fail? We should avoid.\n\n                 if (len_s == 0) then\n                     value = 0\n                 else\n                     read(s, *) value   ! This reads into a default integer? We need a 64-bit integer? We can use a kind=8 integer.\n                 end if\n\n                 if (value >= cnt) then\n                     found = .true.\n                 end if\n             end if\n\n             mask = mask + 1\n          end do\n\n      Step 6: Print value\n\n  However, note: the third program uses a long integer? In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for value and cnt? But note: cnt is the population count (small). But the generated number (like 47) is small? But later ones are large (e.g., 4477). So we should use integer(kind=8) for value.\n\n  But note: the mask might become very large? Since we are only going until we get a value>=cnt and cnt is small (<=17), we break very early (mask=5). So it's safe.\n\n  However, we can avoid the string conversion for the entire mask? We can note that the mask starts at 2 and we break early? So it's acceptable.\n\n  But we can also avoid the string conversion? We can generate the number from the substring without forming the entire binary string? Actually, we have the substring as a binary number? Then we can form the super lucky number by:\n\n      We have the substring s (which is a binary string of length L). Then the super lucky number is formed by replacing 0->4, 1->7? Then the number is in base-10? We can compute the number by:\n\n          value = 0\n          do i = 1, len_s\n              digit = 4\n              if (the bit at position i was 1) then digit = 7\n              value = value * 10 + digit\n          end do\n\n      How to get the bits? We have the string s? Or we can avoid the string? We can use the value (mask - 2^(bit_len-1)) which is the number represented by the substring? But then we don't know the positions? Actually, we need to replace each bit by a digit? Then we need to know the bits from left to right? So we need the string representation? Or we can generate the digits from left to right? We can traverse the bits of the substring? How?\n\n      Actually, we can generate the digits without the string by:\n\n          Let L = bit_len - 1   (the length of the substring)\n          Let x = mask - 2**(bit_len-1)   [this is the value of the substring in binary? But we have the bits? We can extract the bits from the most significant to the least?]\n\n          But note: the substring is the binary representation of x in L bits? Then we can:\n\n            do i = L-1, 0, -1   ? But we want from the highest (leftmost) to the lowest (rightmost). How to get the i-th bit (from the left) of x? We can do:\n\n            Actually, we can form the digits without the string by:\n\n              temp_val = x\n              digit_arr = array of length L (from left to right)\n\n              for i = L, 1, -1\n                 digit_arr(i) = mod(temp_val, 2)   ! but then we get the bits in reverse? Then we reverse the array? Then we can form the number? \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the string for the entire mask, but we are only doing a few iterations? It's acceptable.\n\n  Considering the simplicity and the fact that cnt is small, we'll stick with the string method.\n\n  But note: the Fortran standard does not have dynamic strings? We can allocate a character string of the required length? Actually, we can use an allocatable character.\n\n  Steps for the third part without string? Actually, we can avoid the string by:\n\n      We have the substring value: x = mask - 2**(bit_len-1)  [which is an integer in the range [0, 2^(bit_len-1)-1]? Actually, the mask is in the range [2^(bit_len-1), 2^(bit_len)-1]? So x is in [0, 2^(bit_len-1)-1]? But we want to represent x in exactly L=bit_len-1 bits? Then we can traverse the bits from the highest to the lowest? How?\n\n        We can do:\n\n          value_out = 0\n          do i = 0, L-1\n             bit = ibits(x, L-1-i, 1)   ! extract the i-th bit from the left? Actually, ibits extracts a field of bits? We can extract the bit at position pos? But note: the bit positions: we want the most significant bit? Then we can do:\n\n             We can do:\n\n                 bit = ibits(x, L-1-i, 1)   ! starting at bit position L-1-i, take 1 bit.\n\n          But note: the bits are stored from low to high? Actually, the bit at position 0 is the least significant. Then the bit at position L-1 is the most significant? Then:\n\n            do i = L-1, 0, -1\n                if (btest(x, i)) then   ! but this gives the bit at position i (from 0 to L-1) where 0 is the least? Then i=L-1 is the most significant? Then we can traverse from the most to the least.\n\n          Then:\n\n            value_out = 0\n            do i = L-1, 0, -1\n                if (btest(x, i)) then\n                    digit = 7\n                else\n                    digit = 4\n                end if\n                value_out = value_out * 10 + digit\n            end do\n\n      Then we have the number without string? But note: we must check the condition: zeros == ones? We can count the bits as we go? We know the total length L is even? Then we require that the number of set bits in x is L/2? But note: the condition in the original program: zeros (which are the bits that are 0) should be L/2? Then the ones (bits that are 1) are L/2? So we require:\n\n          popcount(x) = L/2?   -> but note: the condition is that the number of zeros in the substring is L/2? Actually, the substring is of length L, and we require zeros = L/2 and ones = L/2? But zeros = L - popcount(x)? So we require:\n\n          L - popcount(x) = L/2   => popcount(x) = L/2.\n\n      Therefore, we can avoid the string? We can do:\n\n          L = bit_len - 1\n          if (mod(L,2)==0) then\n             if (popcount(x) == L/2) then\n                 ! Then form the number by traversing the bits from the most significant to the least?\n                 value_out = 0\n                 do i = L-1, 0, -1\n                    if (btest(x, i)) then\n                        digit = 7\n                    else\n                        digit = 4\n                    end if\n                    value_out = value_out * 10 + digit\n                 end do\n                 if (value_out >= cnt) then\n                     ! break\n                 end if\n             end if\n          end if\n\n      How to compute popcount? We can use the Fortran intrinsic popcnt? But note: Fortran 2008 has popcnt. Alternatively, we can write a small function.\n\n      But note: the value of x is in the range [0, 2^(L)-1]? And L is at most 20? Because we break when value_out>=cnt and cnt<=17, and the first super lucky number we meet is 47 (L=2) -> then we break? So L is small.\n\n      Steps for the third part without string:\n\n          mask = 2\n          value_out = 0\n          found = .false.\n          integer(kind=8) :: value_out, digit, cnt8   ! cnt8 is the same as cnt but as kind=8\n\n          cnt8 = int(cnt, kind=8)\n\n          do while (.not. found)\n             if (mask == 0) then\n                 bit_len = 1\n             else\n                 temp = mask\n                 bit_len = 0\n                 do while (temp /= 0)\n                    bit_len = bit_len + 1\n                    temp = ishft(temp, -1)\n                 end do\n             end if\n\n             L = bit_len - 1\n             if (L < 0) L = 0\n\n             if (L > 0) then\n                 x = mask - ishft(1, bit_len-1)   ! 2**(bit_len-1) = ishft(1, bit_len-1)\n\n                 ! Check if L is even?\n                 if (mod(L,2)==0) then\n                    ! Count the number of ones in x? (popcount for x in L bits? But note: x has exactly L bits? So we can use:\n                    ones = 0\n                    temp = x\n                    do i = 0, L-1\n                         if (btest(temp, i)) ones = ones + 1\n                    end do\n                    if (ones == L/2) then\n                         ! Form the number\n                         value_out = 0\n                         do i = L-1, 0, -1   ! from the highest bit (position L-1) to the lowest (0)\n                             if (btest(x, i)) then\n                                 digit = 7\n                             else\n                                 digit = 4\n                             end if\n                             value_out = value_out * 10 + digit\n                         end do\n                         if (value_out >= cnt8) then\n                             found = .true.\n                         end if\n                    end if\n                 end if\n             end if\n\n             mask = mask + 1\n          end do\n\n      Then output value_out.\n\n  But note: the mask starts at 2? Then for mask=2: bit_len=2, L=1 -> skip because L is odd? Then mask=3: L=1 -> skip. mask=4: bit_len=3, L=2 -> even. Then x = 4 - 2^(2) = 4-4=0? Then ones in 0? 0. Then we require ones==1? (because L/2=1) -> 0 !=1 -> skip. mask=5: bit_len=3, L=2, x=5-4=1. The binary representation of 1 in 2 bits: 01? But when we traverse the bits from high to low: \n        i=1: bit at position 1? For x=1 (which is 01 in two bits): \n          i=1: btest(1,1) -> is the second bit? 2^1=2 -> 1 < 2 -> false -> digit=4.\n          i=0: btest(1,0) -> true -> digit=7.\n        Then value_out = 0*10+4 -> 4, then 4*10+7 = 47.\n\n      Then 47>=cnt8 (which is cnt) -> found=true.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: the bits of x are stored in a fixed number of bits? But we are only considering the L bits? The number x might have more than L bits? Actually, we subtracted 2^(bit_len-1) so x is in the range [0, 2^L-1]? Then the bits above L-1 are zero? But when we do btest(x, i) for i>=L, it would be false? But we are only looping i from L-1 to 0? So it's safe.\n\n  But note: the btest intrinsic considers the bit representation of x in the machine? But if x is nonnegative and we are only looking at bits 0 to L-1, it's safe? Because x < 2^L? So the bits from L upwards are zero? And we don't look at them.\n\n  Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n    integer(kind=8) function popcount8(x, L)\n        integer, intent(in) :: x, L\n        integer :: i, cnt\n        cnt = 0\n        do i = 0, L-1\n            if (btest(x, i)) cnt = cnt + 1\n        end do\n        popcount8 = cnt\n    end function\n\n  But we don't need a function? We can inline.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read n and the array of n integers.\n\n    Step 2: Sort the array? We can use the Fortran intrinsic sort? But note: the array is of integers. We can use a bubble sort? Or we can use an intrinsic? Fortran doesn't have a standard sort? We can write a simple sort? Since n can be up to 100000? We should use a quick sort? But we are not allowed to use external libraries? We can write a recursive quicksort? Or use the intrinsic from the compiler? But to be standard, we'll write a simple one? Actually, we can use the `sort` from the `iso_fortran_env`? Actually, Fortran 2003 does not have a sort. We'll write a sort? But note: the first program in Java uses Collections.sort -> which is a stable sort? We don't care about stability? We can use a quick sort? Or we can use the minloc repeatedly? That would be O(n^2) -> too slow for n=100000.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the merge sort? Or we can use the Fortran intrinsic subroutine from the `stdlib`? But the problem says we cannot rely on external? So we write a quick sort? \n\n    We'll write a recursive quick sort? But the array size is 100000 -> recursion might be deep? We can use an iterative quick sort? Or we can use heap sort? \n\n    Since the problem does not specify the performance, and to keep it simple, we'll use a built-in sort if available? But the instructions say to write a single Fortran program? We can use a simple sort? Actually, the original Java program uses a sort that is efficient? We should use an efficient sort.\n\n    We'll write a quick sort in Fortran? \n\n    Alternatively, note: the first program only uses the sorted array to compute c. The algorithm for c:\n\n        sort the list\n        c = 1\n        for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if list[i] >= c: c++\n\n        This is: we are counting how many numbers are at least c? Actually, it is: we traverse the sorted list and whenever we see a number >= c, we increment c? So we can do without sorting? Actually, no: we need to traverse in increasing order? \n\n        How about: we don't need the entire sorted array? We can use a frequency array? But we don't know the range? The numbers in the list are integers? The problem doesn't specify? But the first program uses integers? We can assume they are positive? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a min-heap? But that is more complex.\n\n        We'll do a quick sort? \n\n    We'll write a recursive quick sort? \n\n    Steps for quick sort:\n\n        subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n          integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n          integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n          if (low < high) then\n             pivot = arr(high)\n             i = low - 1\n             do j = low, high-1\n                 if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                     i = i+1\n                     temp = arr(i)\n                     arr(i) = arr(j)\n                     arr(j) = temp\n                 end if\n             end do\n             temp = arr(i+1)\n             arr(i+1) = arr(high)\n             arr(high) = temp\n             call quicksort(arr, low, i)\n             call quicksort(arr, i+2, high)\n          end if\n        end subroutine\n\n    But note: worst-case O(n^2)? We can use a random pivot? But for simplicity, we use the last element? And hope the input is not worst-case? The problem does not specify the input.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `sort` from the `stdlib`? But we are not allowed? \n\n    Given the constraints (n up to 100000) we need an efficient sort? We can use the merge sort? \n\n    But to keep the code short, we'll use the quick sort with the first element as pivot? Actually, the above uses the last? \n\n    We'll do:\n\n      pivot = arr( (low+high)/2 )   ? Actually, we can choose the middle? Then swap with the last? Then proceed? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the Fortran intrinsic `sort` if we are using a compiler that supports it? But the problem says to write a single Fortran program? So we write a sort.\n\n    We'll use the quick sort from Rosetta code? \n\n    Actually, we can use a simple one: \n\n      recursive subroutine quicksort(a)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        integer :: split\n        if (size(a) > 1) then\n            call partition(a, split)\n            call quicksort(a(:split-1))\n            call quicksort(a(split:))\n        end if\n      end subroutine\n\n      subroutine partition(a, marker)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        integer, intent(out) :: marker\n        integer :: i, j, temp, x\n        x = a(1)   ! pivot\n        i = 0\n        j = size(a) + 1\n        do\n            j = j-1\n            do while (a(j) > x)\n                j = j-1\n            end do\n            i = i+1\n            do while (a(i) < x)\n                i = i+1\n            end do\n            if (i < j) then\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n            else if (i == j) then\n                marker = i+1\n                return\n            else\n                marker = i\n                return\n            end if\n        end do\n      end subroutine\n\n    But note: the above is for 1-based indexing? \n\n    However, we don't want to write a long sort? We can use the intrinsic from the `iso_fortran_env`? Actually, there isn't one. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the `sort` from `stdlib`? But the problem says not to use external libraries? \n\n    Considering the constraints, we can use an O(n^2) sort? But n=100000 -> O(n^2)=10^10 -> too slow.\n\n    Therefore, we'll write a quick sort? \n\n    We'll use the iterative version? Or we can use the recursive and hope the stack is deep enough? \n\n    We'll write a non-recursive quick sort using a stack? \n\n    But to save time, we'll write a recursive one and hope the input is not worst-case? We can use a random pivot? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the heap sort? \n\n    We decide to write a quick sort with random pivot? \n\n    Steps for quick sort (recursive) with random pivot:\n\n        recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n          integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n          integer :: i, j, pivot, temp, pivot_index\n          if (left < right) then\n             ! Choose a random pivot between left and right\n             call random_number(u)\n             pivot_index = left + floor((right-left+1)*u)\n             pivot = arr(pivot_index)\n             ! Swap pivot to the end\n             temp = arr(pivot_index)\n             arr(pivot_index) = arr(right)\n             arr(right) = temp\n\n             i = left - 1\n             do j = left, right-1\n                 if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                     i = i+1\n                     temp = arr(i)\n                     arr(i) = arr(j)\n                     arr(j) = temp\n                 end if\n             end do\n             temp = arr(i+1)\n             arr(i+1) = arr(right)\n             arr(right) = temp\n\n             call quicksort(arr, left, i)\n             call quicksort(arr, i+2, right)\n          end if\n        end subroutine\n\n    But we don't have a random number? We don't care about the pivot? We can use the middle? \n\n    We'll use the middle: pivot_index = (left+right)/2\n\n    Actually, we'll use:\n\n        pivot_index = (left+right)/2\n\n    Then swap with the rightmost? \n\n  However, to avoid deep recursion, we can use an iterative quick sort? \n\n  Given the time, we'll use the Fortran intrinsic if available? But it's not. \n\n  We decide to use the merge sort? It is O(n log n) and stable? \n\n  But to keep the code as short as possible, and since n can be up to 100000, we'll use the merge sort? \n\n  We'll write a merge sort? \n\n  Steps for merge sort (iterative, bottom-up):\n\n      subroutine merge_sort(arr, n)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer :: width, i\n        integer, allocatable :: work(:)\n        allocate(work(n))\n        width = 1\n        do while (width < n)\n          do i = 0, n-1, 2*width\n             call merge(arr, work, i, min(i+width, n), min(i+2*width, n))\n          end do\n          arr = work   ! copy back? Actually, we should swap\n          width = width * 2\n        end do\n        deallocate(work)\n      end subroutine\n\n      subroutine merge(arr, work, left, mid, right)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:), work(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: left, mid, right\n        integer :: i, j, k\n        i = left\n        j = mid\n        k = left\n        do while (i < mid .and. j < right)\n            if (arr(i) <= arr(j)) then\n                work(k) = arr(i)\n                i = i+1\n            else\n                work(k) = arr(j)\n                j = j+1\n            end if\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (i < mid)\n            work(k) = arr(i)\n            i = i+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (j < right)\n            work(k) = arr(j)\n            j = j+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        ! Copy work(left:right-1) to arr(left:right-1)? Actually, we are not using work for the whole array? \n        ! But we are passing the entire array? Then we should copy the merged segment back? But in the above, we are not copying back? \n        ! In the main loop, we are doing: arr = work? That copies the entire array. So we don't need to copy in merge? \n        ! Actually, in the main loop we are merging from arr to work, then setting arr=work. Then in the next pass, we merge from arr to work again? So we need to swap? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the copy by swapping the roles of arr and work? \n\n        But to keep it simple, we'll do a copy at the end of the width pass? \n\n      end subroutine\n\n  But note: the above is for 0-based indexing? Fortran is 1-based? \n\n  We'll adjust to 1-based indexing? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a recursive merge sort? \n\n  Considering the complexity, we decide to use the quick sort with middle pivot? \n\n  We'll do:\n\n      recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n        integer :: i, j, pivot, temp\n        i = left\n        j = right\n        pivot = arr((left+right)/2)\n        do while (i <= j)\n            do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n                i = i+1\n            end do\n            do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n                j = j-1\n            end do\n            if (i <= j) then\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = temp\n                i = i+1\n                j = j-1\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (left < j) call quicksort(arr, left, j)\n        if (i < right) call quicksort(arr, i, right)\n      end subroutine\n\n  This is the classic quick sort? \n\n  We'll use this.\n\n  Now, we write the entire program in Fortran? \n\n  We'll use:\n\n      program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i, c, cnt, ones, bit_len, L, x, temp, mask, j\n        integer(kind=8) :: value_out, cnt8, digit\n        integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n        logical :: found\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n and the list\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(list(n))\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) list(i)\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 2: Sort the list using quicksort\n        call quicksort(list, 1, n)\n\n        !

Step 3: Compute the population count of c\n        cnt = 0\n        temp = c\n        do while (temp > 0)\n            if (btest(temp, 0)) cnt = cnt + 1\n            temp = ishft(temp, -1)\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 4: Find the super lucky number >= cnt\n        ! Convert cnt to kind=8\n        cnt8 = int(cnt, kind=8)\n        mask = 2\n        found = .false.\n        value_out = 0\n\n        do while (.not. found)\n            ! Compute bit_len of mask\n            if (mask == 0) then\n                bit_len = 1\n            else\n                bit_len = 0\n                temp = mask\n                do while (temp > 0)\n                    bit_len = bit_len + 1\n                    temp = ishft(temp, -1)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n            L = bit_len - 1\n            if (L <= 0) then\n                x = 0\n            else\n                x = mask - ishft(1, bit_len-1)   ! 2^(bit_len-1)\n            end if\n\n            !

Output the value_out\n        print *, value_out\n\n        deallocate(list)\n\n      contains\n\n        recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n          integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n          integer :: i, j, pivot, temp\n          i = left\n          j = right\n          pivot = arr((left+right)/2)\n          do while (i <= j)\n              do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n                  i = i+1\n              end do\n              do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n                  j = j-1\n              end do\n              if (i <= j) then\n                  temp = arr(i)\n                  arr(i) = arr(j)\n                  arr(j) = temp\n                  i = i+1\n                  j = j-1\n              end if\n          end do\n          if (left < j) call quicksort(arr, left, j)\n          if (i < right) call quicksort(arr, i, right)\n        end subroutine quicksort\n\n      end program combined\n\n  But note: the quicksort might be slow for worst-case? But we hope the input is average? \n\n  Also, note: the btest might not work for negative integers? But c is positive? And mask is positive? So x is nonnegative? \n\n  Let's test with a small input for the first program:\n\n      n=3, list = [1, 2, 3]\n\n      Sorted: [1,2,3]\n      c=1: 1>=1 -> c=2; 2>=2 -> c=3; 3>=3 -> c=4.\n      Then cnt = popcount(4) = 1 (because 4 in binary is 100 -> one '1')\n      Then we look for the smallest super lucky number >= 1.\n\n      mask=2: L=1 (bit_len=2) -> skip (L must be even and positive? L=1 is odd -> skip)\n      mask=3: L=1 -> skip.\n      mask=4: L=2 -> even. x=4 - 2^(3-1)=4-4=0. Then ones in x (in 2 bits) = 0? Then we require ones=1? -> no.\n      mask=5: L=2 -> x=5-4=1. The ones: in 2 bits: 01 -> one '1'? -> yes. Then form the number: \n          j=1: btest(1,1) -> false -> digit=4\n          j=0: btest(1,0) -> true -> digit=7\n          value_out = 4*10+7 = 47.\n      Then 47>=1 -> break. Output 47.\n\n      But the expected output from the chain? The first program outputs 4? The second program: input=4 -> binary representation of 4 is \"100\", then the string \"100\" -> then the count of ones is 1. Then the third program: input=1 -> then the same as above: output 47.\n\n      So the chain outputs 47.\n\n  However, the second program: when input is 4, it does:\n\n        n=4\n        s = \"\"\n        while (n>0): \n            x = n % 2 = 0, n=2 -> s=\"0\"\n            x = 2 % 2 = 0, n=1 -> s=\"00\"\n            x = 1 % 2 = 1, n=0 -> s=\"001\"\n        Then count the ones: 1 -> output 1.\n\n      So the second program outputs 1.\n\n  Therefore, the third program is given 1.\n\n  And the third program: \n        number=1\n        mask=2: binary \"10\" -> substring(1) is \"0\" -> zeros=1, ones=0 -> not equal -> skip.\n        mask=3: \"11\" -> \"1\" -> zeros=0, ones=1 -> not equal? \n        mask=4: \"100\" -> \"00\" -> zeros=2, ones=0 -> not equal.\n        mask=5: \"101\" -> \"01\" -> zeros=1, ones=1 -> equal. Then form \"47\" -> 47. Then output 47.\n\n  So the chain output is 47.\n\n  Our Fortran program outputs 47 for input [1,2,3]? \n\n  Therefore, we are good.\n\n  But note: the second program in the original chain reads the output of the first program? Which is 4? Then outputs 1? \n\n  In our Fortran program, we computed:\n        c=4\n        cnt = popcount(4) = 1\n\n  How did we compute the popcount? We did:\n\n        cnt = 0\n        temp = 4\n        while (temp>0):\n            if (btest(temp,0)) then cnt++  -> btest(4,0): 4 in binary: 100 -> the bit0 is 0 -> skip.\n            then temp = ishft(4,-1) = 2\n            then btest(2,0): 10 -> bit0=0 -> skip.\n            then temp=1\n            btest(1,0): true -> cnt=1.\n            then temp=0 -> break.\n\n  So we get 1.\n\n  Therefore, correct.\n\n  We'll write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  Note: We must use integer(kind=8) for value_out because 47 is small, but later super lucky numbers might be large? But the input to the third program is small (<=17) so we only generate numbers up to 47? But if the population count is 17, then we generate 47? But what if the population count is 100? Then we might generate a large number? But the population count of an integer c (which is at most n+1, n<=100000) is at most about 17? So it's safe? \n\n  But to be safe, we use integer(kind=8) for value_out.\n\n  Also, mask is an integer? It will be at most 2^(L+1)-1? And L is at most 20? So mask is at most 2^21? which is 2097152? So integer is enough.\n\n  Final code:"
