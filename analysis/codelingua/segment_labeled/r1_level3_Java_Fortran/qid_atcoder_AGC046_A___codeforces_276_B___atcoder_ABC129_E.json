Actually the code does two separate blocks?] Actually, the third program has two parts for each character:\n\n   Part A:\n        if (s[i]=='0') {\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            // and then it doesn't set dp[i+1][0] in the else of part A?

So the entire chain:\n\n   Input: an integer (x0)\n\n   Step 1: Compute count (from the first program) for x0. Step 2: Convert count to a string (say S1). Step 3: For the second program:\n        - Count frequency of each char in S1 -> get a map. - oddCount = number of chars in the map with odd frequency.\n        - Then:\n            if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)==1) then\n                S2 = \"First\"\n            else\n                S2 = \"Second\"\n            endif\n\n   Step 4: For the third program:\n        - Let n = length of S2. - Initialize dp(0,0)=1, dp(0,1)=0? Actually the Java code initializes a 2D array of size [n+1][2] and sets dp[0][0]=1, dp[0][1] is not set explicitly? But in Java, integers are initialized to 0. So we have:\n            dp(0,0) = 1\n            dp(0,1) = 0\n        - Then for each character in S2 (from i=0 to n-1, where n is the length of S2):\n            if the character is '0':\n                dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n                dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1) Then: dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2) mod M\n            else:   // meaning not '0'\n                dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i,0) + dp(i,1)) mod M   // note: this sets dp(i+1,1) but does not set dp(i+1,0) at this point? Then: \n                    dp(i+1,0) = (dp(i+1,0) + dp(i,0)*2) mod M\n                    dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2) mod M\n\n        - But note: in the else part of the first block, we set dp(i+1,1) to a new value. Then in the second block (which is the same for both) we do an update. Actually, the code in the third program:\n\n            if (s[i] == '0') {\n                dp[i + 1][0] = dp[i][0];\n                dp[i + 1][1] = dp[i][1];\n            } else {\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            }\n\n            // Then, separate if-else for the second update?\n            if (s[i] == '0') {\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n            } else {\n                dp[i + 1][0] = (dp[i + 1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n            }\n\n        So we must do the same. Step 5: Output = (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod M.\n\nNow, we write a Fortran program that does:\n\n   - Read an integer (x0) from standard input. - Step 1: Compute count for x0 (like the first program). - Step 2: Convert count to a string (S1).\n   - Step 3: Process S1 to compute the frequency of each character -> then compute oddCount -> then set S2 as either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n   - Step 4: Process the string S2 with the DP of the third program (mod 1000000007).\n   - Step 5: Print the result (the output of the third program). Important: We must not do any I/O in between. Only the initial read and the final write. Let's code accordingly. Note: Fortran has fixed-size arrays. We need to set maximum lengths for the strings.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each program:\n\n1. **File 1 (atcoder_AGC046_A)**:\n   - Reads an integer `x`.\n   - Then it computes the smallest number of steps (count) such that repeatedly adding `x` (and subtracting 360 if the sum exceeds 360) until the sum becomes 360.\n   - Outputs the count.\n\n   Example: If x=90, then steps: 90 -> 180 -> 270 -> 360 -> count=4.\n\n2. **File 2 (codeforces_276_B)**:\n   - Reads a string.\n   - Counts the frequency of each character and then counts how many characters have an odd frequency (oddCount).\n   - If oddCount is 0, 1, or an odd number, it prints \"First\". Otherwise, it prints \"Second\".\n\n3. **File 3 (atcoder_ABC129_E)**:\n   - Reads a string of binary digits (without spaces).\n   - Uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to split the binary number under certain conditions (mod 1000000007).\n\nHowever, note the sequence: \n   - The first program outputs an integer (the count).\n   - The second program expects a string as input. Therefore, the integer output from the first must be converted to a string to become the input of the second.\n   - The third program also expects a string (a binary string). But the second program outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\". This does not match the input expected by the third (which is a binary string). \n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the chain as described might not be intended. But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo, we have to consider:\n\nStep 1: Run first program with the initial input (an integer read from stdin). It outputs an integer (say `n`).\nStep 2: The second program is then run with the input being the string representation of `n` (because the second program reads a string). \nStep 3: The second program outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\". Then the third program uses that string as its input.\n\nBut the third program expects a binary string (only '0's and '1's). The string \"First\" or \"Second\" is not a binary string. This will cause the third program to process a non-binary string.\n\nThis implies that the chain might not be correctly specified? However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nWe must replicate the entire chain exactly. So:\n\n1. The initial input is an integer (for the first program).\n2. Then the output of the first program (an integer) is passed as a string to the second program.\n3. The output of the second program (either \"First\" or \"Second\") is passed as a string to the third program.\n\nWe must write a Fortran program that:\n   - Reads an integer (for the first step).\n   - Then processes the chain without intermediate I/O.\n\nHowever, the third program is designed for binary strings. We must run it with the string \"First\" or \"Second\". The original Java program for the third program (atcoder_ABC129_E) will process any string of characters. It uses `char[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();` and then checks for each character if it is '0' or not. For non-'0' characters, it treats them as '1'? Actually, note:\n\nIn the third program:\n   - It checks `if (s[i]=='0')` and then an `else` block. So any character that is not '0' is treated as non-zero (like '1').\n\nBut the string \"First\" contains non-zero characters? Actually, the third program will process the string regardless.\n\nBut note: the original third program is for a problem about binary numbers. However, the code does not validate the input. It will run on any string.\n\nSo we have to do:\n\nStep 1: Read an integer (let's call it `x0`).\nStep 2: Compute the first program's result: `count` (an integer).\nStep 3: Convert `count` to a string (say `str1`).\nStep 4: For the second program: \n        - Count the frequency of each character in `str1`.\n        - Count the number of characters with odd frequency (oddCount).\n        - Then, if oddCount<=1 or oddCount is odd, then set `str2 = \"First\"`, else `str2 = \"Second\"`.\nStep 5: For the third program: \n        - Take the string `str2` (which is either \"First\" or \"Second\") and process it as a string of characters.\n\nBut note: the third program uses modulo 1000000007 and a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me reexamine the third program:\n\n   - The state `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` are updated for each character.\n   - The rules:\n        If the current character is '0':\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n            Then additionally: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M   [but note: this is done after the above? Actually the code does two separate blocks?]\n\nActually, the third program has two parts for each character:\n\n   Part A:\n        if (s[i]=='0') {\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            // and then it doesn't set dp[i+1][0] in the else of part A? Actually, it sets only the [1] state in the else of part A.\n        }\n\n   Part B:\n        if (s[i]=='0') {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n        }\n\nThis is a bit complex, but we can replicate it for the string \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n   Input: an integer (x0)\n\n   Step 1: Compute count (from the first program) for x0.\n\n   Step 2: Convert count to a string (say S1).\n\n   Step 3: For the second program:\n        - Count frequency of each char in S1 -> get a map.\n        - oddCount = number of chars in the map with odd frequency.\n        - Then:\n            if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)==1) then\n                S2 = \"First\"\n            else\n                S2 = \"Second\"\n            endif\n\n   Step 4: For the third program:\n        - Let n = length of S2.\n        - Initialize dp(0,0)=1, dp(0,1)=0? Actually the Java code initializes a 2D array of size [n+1][2] and sets dp[0][0]=1, dp[0][1] is not set explicitly? But in Java, integers are initialized to 0. So we have:\n            dp(0,0) = 1\n            dp(0,1) = 0\n        - Then for each character in S2 (from i=0 to n-1, where n is the length of S2):\n            if the character is '0':\n                dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n                dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n                Then: dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2) mod M\n            else:   // meaning not '0'\n                dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i,0) + dp(i,1)) mod M   // note: this sets dp(i+1,1) but does not set dp(i+1,0) at this point?\n                Then: \n                    dp(i+1,0) = (dp(i+1,0) + dp(i,0)*2) mod M\n                    dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2) mod M\n\n        - But note: in the else part of the first block, we set dp(i+1,1) to a new value. Then in the second block (which is the same for both) we do an update.\n\n        Actually, the code in the third program:\n\n            if (s[i] == '0') {\n                dp[i + 1][0] = dp[i][0];\n                dp[i + 1][1] = dp[i][1];\n            } else {\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            }\n\n            // Then, separate if-else for the second update?\n            if (s[i] == '0') {\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n            } else {\n                dp[i + 1][0] = (dp[i + 1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n                dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n            }\n\n        So we must do the same.\n\n   Step 5: Output = (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod M.\n\nNow, we write a Fortran program that does:\n\n   - Read an integer (x0) from standard input.\n   - Step 1: Compute count for x0 (like the first program).\n   - Step 2: Convert count to a string (S1).\n   - Step 3: Process S1 to compute the frequency of each character -> then compute oddCount -> then set S2 as either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n   - Step 4: Process the string S2 with the DP of the third program (mod 1000000007).\n   - Step 5: Print the result (the output of the third program).\n\nImportant: We must not do any I/O in between. Only the initial read and the final write.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nNote: Fortran has fixed-size arrays. We need to set maximum lengths for the strings.\n\nHow long can the intermediate strings be?\n\n   Step 1: The integer `x0` is read. The first program: the count is the number of steps to reach 360 by adding `x0` repeatedly. The maximum count? \n        The worst-case: if x0=1, then count=360. So the string representation of count is at most 3 digits (360 -> 3 characters) or 4? Actually, 360 is 3, but 1 gives 360 -> 360 is 3 digits. So maximum 3 digits? Actually, the count is at most 360, so 3 digits.\n\n   Step 2: S1 is a string of 1 to 3 digits.\n\n   Step 3: S2 is either \"First\" (5 characters) or \"Second\" (6 characters). So the maximum length is 6.\n\n   Step 4: The DP for the third program: we can allocate an array for up to 6+1=7 states.\n\nSo we can safely set:\n\n   - For S1: character variable of length 10 (to be safe).\n   - For S2: character variable of length 6.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   Read x0 (integer)\n\n   Step 1: Compute count (integer) for the first program.\n\n   Step 2: Convert count to a string (S1) and get its length (L1).\n\n   Step 3: For S1 (of length L1), count the frequency of each digit. Then compute oddCount. Then set S2.\n\n   Step 4: Let n = len_trim(S2)  [we don't have trailing spaces? Actually, we will build S2 without spaces] but note: we are going to process each character. We can use the entire string of 5 or 6 characters.\n\n   Step 5: Run the DP for the third program on S2.\n\n   Step 6: Print the result.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nNote: The third program uses modulo M = 1000000007.\n\nWe'll write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nImportant: We must use the same logic as the original Java programs.\n\nLet me write the Fortran code:\n\n  1. Read the integer\n  2. First program logic (with the while loop)\n  3. Convert the integer result to a string (using internal write)\n  4. Build frequency map for the string (only for digits, but the string is composed of digits). We can use an array of size 0:9? But note: the string might have non-digit? No, it's the integer we converted. Actually, it's digits. But to be generic? Actually, the integer converted to string will have only digits. But the second program in Java uses a HashMap that works for any character. However, our string is only digits. We can use an array of size 48:57 (ASCII for '0' to '9') but easier: we can use a map? Fortran doesn't have built-in maps. Alternatively, we can use an array of size 0:9 and index by the digit.\n\n  How about: \n        integer :: freq(0:9) = 0\n        for each character in S1 (trimmed):\n            read the character as a digit? Or convert to integer? Or we can use the ASCII value? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the string is short (max 3) and the digits are in the set '0'..'9'. We can do:\n\n        do i = 1, len_trim(S1)\n            c = S1(i:i)\n            ! convert character to integer index: \n            idx = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n            freq(idx) = freq(idx) + 1\n        end do\n\n  Then, oddCount = count of frequencies that are odd (for each index in 0:9, if freq(idx) is odd and nonzero? note: if freq is zero we skip? but it's zero so not odd).\n\n  But note: the Java program counts for every character in the string. It doesn't matter if the digit is the same as another? It uses the character. But in our case, the same digit might appear multiple times? Yes. Our frequency array counts per digit. This is the same as the Java program: it maps each character (so same digit is the same character) -> then we get the frequency per digit.\n\n  Then we compute oddCount = 0\n        do i=0,9\n            if (freq(i) > 0 .and. mod(freq(i),2)==1) then\n                oddCount = oddCount + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n  5. Then set S2: \n        if (oddCount<=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)==1) then\n            S2 = \"First\"\n        else\n            S2 = \"Second\"\n        end if\n\n  6. Then run the third program on S2.\n\n  7. The DP for the third program:\n\n        integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n        integer :: n, i\n        integer :: dp(0:6, 0:1)   ! 0:6 because n up to 6, and two states: 0 and 1.\n\n        n = len_trim(S2)\n\n        ! Initialize: dp(0,0) = 1, dp(0,1)=0\n        dp(0,0) = 1\n        dp(0,1) = 0\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            c = S2(i:i)\n            if (c == '0') then\n                ! First block: for '0'\n                dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n                dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n                ! Then the second block for '0'\n                dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + mod(2 * dp(i-1,1), M), M)\n                ! But note: we must mod at each step? The Java program mods each operation.\n            else\n                ! First block: for non-'0'\n                dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n                ! Then the second block for non-'0'\n                dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + mod(2 * dp(i-1,0), M), M)   ! but note: initially dp(i,0) is not set? Actually, we just set dp(i,1) above. dp(i,0) is still uninitialized? \n\n                How did the Java program do?\n                  In the first block for non-zero: they set only dp(i+1,1). Then in the second block, they do:\n                    dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n                    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n\n                But note: initially, dp[i+1][0] was 0? Because the array is allocated and initialized to 0? \n\n                In Fortran, we have to initialize the current state to 0? Actually, we are using an array we defined. We set the previous states. For the new state at index i, we haven't set them. So we must initialize the current state (for index i) to 0? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  Before the if-else, set the current state (for step i) to 0 for both?\n\n                Let me reexamine the Java code: the dp array is of size [n+1][2] and is initialized to 0 by Java. Then we set dp[0][0]=1. Then for each i from 0 to n-1, we update dp[i+1][?] by adding. So in Fortran, we should initialize the current row to 0 before the first block?\n\n                How about: at the start of each iteration, set dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) to 0? Actually, the Java code does not set the current state to zero? It sets the next state only by assignment and then addition? But note:\n\n                  For '0':\n                    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];   -> overwrites\n                    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];   -> overwrites\n                    Then: dp[i+1][1] = ...   -> which is an addition? Actually, it is: dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + ...)\n\n                  For non-'0':\n                    dp[i+1][1] = ...   -> sets to a value (overwriting any previous value? because the array was zero initially? but we are at step i+1, which was zero initially) \n                    Then: dp[i+1][0] = ... (which is adding to the current value? but at the time of the second block, the value was set in the first block for non-zero? only for [1] and [0] is still zero? Then we add.\n\n                Actually, the Java code does not initialize the next state to zero? It relies on the array being zero initially? So we must set the current state (for row i) to zero at the beginning of the iteration? Or we can do:\n\n                We'll have a dp array for the current and next? Actually, we are using a 2D array. We can initialize the row for step i (which we are about to compute) to 0 at the start of the loop.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use two variables for the previous state and update the next state. But the problem is that the next state is updated in two separate blocks.\n\n                I think it's easier to use:\n\n                  Let dp_prev0 = dp(i-1,0)\n                  Let dp_prev1 = dp(i-1,1)\n\n                  Then compute the next state for i (which we will store in dp(i,0) and dp(i,1)) from scratch.\n\n                But note: the second block in the Java code adds to the state that was set in the first block.\n\n                How about we break the state for the current step into two parts? \n\n                Instead, we can:\n\n                  Initialize the current state (for step i) to zero at the beginning of the iteration.\n\n                But the Java code doesn't do that? It relies on the array being zero initially? Actually, the array is allocated to zeros. So at step i+1, the state starts as 0. Then the first block might set some values (overwriting the zero) and then the second block adds.\n\n                Therefore, we can:\n\n                  For each i (from 0 to n-1) for the current character:\n\n                    dp(i,0) = 0\n                    dp(i,1) = 0   ? But wait, we are going to set them in the first block? \n\n                Actually, no: for the first block:\n\n                  For '0': \n                    we set dp(i,0) = dp_prev0 -> overwrites the zero\n                    dp(i,1) = dp_prev1 -> overwrites the zero\n\n                  Then the second block: \n                    dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1\n\n                  For non-zero:\n                    we set dp(i,1) = dp_prev0 + dp_prev1   -> overwrites the zero\n                    Then the second block:\n                       dp(i,0) = dp(i,0) + 2 * dp_prev0   -> but dp(i,0) is still zero? because we set only dp(i,1) in the first block? Then we add 2*dp_prev0 to dp(i,0) (which becomes 2*dp_prev0)\n                       dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1\n\n                So if we initialize the current state to zero at the beginning of the loop, we can do the same.\n\n                Therefore, we do:\n\n                  do i = 1, n\n                    dp(i,0) = 0\n                    dp(i,1) = 0\n\n                    if (c=='0') then\n                       dp(i,0) = dp(i,0) + dp(i-1,0)\n                       dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + dp(i-1,1)\n                       ! Then second block\n                       dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)\n                    else\n                       dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n                       ! Then second block\n                       dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2 * dp(i-1,0), M)\n                       dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)\n                    end if\n                  end do\n\n                But wait, in the Java code for non-zero, the first block sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) mod M. Then the second block adds to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]. So:\n\n                  dp(i,1) = (dp_prev0 + dp_prev1)  [from the first block]\n                  then: \n                      dp(i,0) += 2 * dp_prev0\n                      dp(i,1) += 2 * dp_prev1\n\n                So we can write:\n\n                  if (c=='0') then\n                     dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)   ! because we started at 0 and then add the first part\n                     dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)   ! same\n                     ! Then add: 2 * dp(i-1,1) to state1\n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)\n                  else\n                     ! First block: set state1 to the sum\n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n                     ! Then second block: add 2 * dp(i-1,0) to state0 and 2 * dp(i-1,1) to state1\n                     dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2 * dp(i-1,0), M)   ! note: dp(i,0) is currently 0? but we set only dp(i,1) above? so we can write:\n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)\n                  end if\n\n                However, note: in the non-zero case, the state0 is being set to 2 * dp_prev0? and state1 is set to (dp_prev0+dp_prev1) + 2 * dp_prev1.\n\n                But wait: in the Java code, the second block for non-zero does:\n\n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n\n                But note: at the time of the second block, dp[i+1][0] was 0? because the first block didn't set it? Then we add 2 * dp_prev0 to state0? and 2 * dp_prev1 to state1? \n\n                So:\n\n                  state0 = 2 * dp_prev0\n                  state1 = (dp_prev0+dp_prev1) + 2 * dp_prev1 = dp_prev0 + 3 * dp_prev1\n\n                But that doesn't look right. \n\n                Let me check the Java code again:\n\n                  // First block for non-zero: \n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n                  // Then second block for non-zero:\n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;   // here, dp[i+1][0] was 0 (by initialization) so becomes 2 * dp[i][0]\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;   // so we add 2 * dp[i][1] to the value set in the first block.\n\n                Therefore, we have:\n\n                  dp(i,0) = 2 * dp_prev0\n                  dp(i,1) = (dp_prev0 + dp_prev1) + 2 * dp_prev1   -> no, we add 2 * dp_prev1 to the state1 that we set in the first block.\n\n                So:\n\n                  dp(i,0) = 2 * dp_prev0\n                  dp(i,1) = (dp_prev0 + dp_prev1) + 2 * dp_prev1 = dp_prev0 + 3 * dp_prev1? \n\n                Actually, no: the state1 is set to (dp_prev0+dp_prev1) and then we add 2 * dp_prev1 -> so it becomes dp_prev0 + dp_prev1 + 2 * dp_prev1 = dp_prev0 + 3 * dp_prev1? \n\n                But that is not what the code does: the second block is adding 2 * dp_prev1 to the current state1 (which is the value from the first block). So yes.\n\n                However, note: the state1 in the second block is the same state we set in the first block? So we can do:\n\n                  if (c=='0') then\n                     dp(i,0) = dp_prev0\n                     dp(i,1) = dp_prev1\n                     dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1\n                  else\n                     dp(i,0) = 0   ! we are going to set it below? \n                     dp(i,1) = dp_prev0 + dp_prev1   ! from the first block\n                     dp(i,0) = dp(i,0) + 2 * dp_prev0\n                     dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1\n                  end if\n\n                But note: we are modding? And we must mod each operation? The Java code mods at each operation.\n\n                Alternatively, we can avoid initializing the current state to zero by doing:\n\n                  if (c=='0') then\n                     dp(i,0) = dp_prev0\n                     dp(i,1) = dp_prev1 + 2 * dp_prev1   ! but wait: we are adding 2*dp_prev1 to the state1 that we set to dp_prev1 -> so dp_prev1 * 3? \n                  else\n                     dp(i,0) = 2 * dp_prev0\n                     dp(i,1) = (dp_prev0 + dp_prev1) + 2 * dp_prev1\n                  end if\n\n                But that is not what the Java code does for '0'? For '0':\n\n                  First block: \n                    dp(i,0) = dp_prev0\n                    dp(i,1) = dp_prev1\n                  Then second block: \n                    dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1   -> so becomes dp_prev1 + 2 * dp_prev1 = 3 * dp_prev1\n\n                Actually, the Java code for '0' in the second block is:\n\n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n                So the state1 becomes the value from the first block (dp_prev1) plus 2 * dp_prev1? \n\n                But note: the second block for '0' uses the previous state? Actually, it uses the same previous state as the first block? Yes, because the first block uses the previous state and then the second block also uses the same previous state? \n\n                However, the Java code uses the state at index i (which is the previous state for the next state). So the two blocks for the same next state index (i+1) both use the state at index i (the previous state). \n\n                Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                  For '0':\n                     state0 = dp_prev0\n                     state1 = dp_prev1 + 2 * dp_prev1   -> but wait, the first block set state1 to dp_prev1, then we add 2 * dp_prev1 -> so state1 = 3 * dp_prev1? \n\n                That doesn't match the Java code? The Java code for '0':\n\n                  dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];   // so state0 = dp_prev0\n                  dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];   // state1 = dp_prev1\n                  then: \n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;   // so state1 = state1 + 2 * dp_prev1 = dp_prev1 + 2 * dp_prev1 = 3 * dp_prev1\n\n                But wait, that seems odd. Why would we do that?\n\n                Actually, the Java code for the first block and the second block for '0' are:\n\n                  if (s[i] == '0') {\n                    dp[i + 1][0] = dp[i][0];\n                    dp[i + 1][1] = dp[i][1];\n                  } else {\n                    dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n                  }\n                  if (s[i] == '0') {\n                    dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n                  } else {\n                    dp[i + 1][0] = (dp[i + 1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n                    dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i + 1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n                  }\n\n                So for '0', the second block is an update to the state that was set in the first block? \n\n                Therefore, we can compute without initializing the current state to zero? Because the first block sets the current state to the previous state? Then the second block adds an amount that is computed from the previous state? \n\n                So we don't need to initialize the current state to zero? Because we set it in the first block? \n\n                Then for non-zero: the first block sets state1, and the second block sets state0 and updates state1? \n\n                How about we do:\n\n                  if (c=='0') then\n                     dp(i,0) = dp_prev0\n                     dp(i,1) = dp_prev1\n                     ! Then update state1: \n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1, M)\n                  else\n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp_prev0 + dp_prev1, M)\n                     dp(i,0) = mod(0 + 2 * dp_prev0, M)   ! because state0 was not set? \n                     ! But wait: in the Java code, state0 is set by the second block: it adds 2 * dp_prev0 to the current state0 (which was not set in the first block, so it was 0). \n                     dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp_prev1, M)\n                  end if\n\n                However, note: in the non-zero case, the state0 is only set in the second block? and we are setting it to 2 * dp_prev0? \n\n                But what about if the state0 was set elsewhere? We haven't set it? So it's safe.\n\n                Therefore, we don't need to initialize the current state to zero? Because:\n\n                  For '0': we set both states in the first block and then update state1 in the second block.\n                  For non-zero: we set state1 in the first block and then set state0 and update state1 in the second block.\n\n                But note: the state0 for non-zero: we set it to 2 * dp_prev0? That's correct.\n\n                However, we must be cautious: the array dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) might contain garbage? So we must initialize the entire dp array to 0 at the beginning? \n\n                We can do:\n\n                  integer :: dp(0:6, 0:1) = 0   ! initialize to zero.\n\n                Then:\n\n                  dp(0,0) = 1\n                  dp(0,1) = 0\n\n                  do i=1, n\n                     if (c=='0') then\n                         dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)   ! overwrites the zero\n                         dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)   ! overwrites the zero\n                         dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)   ! then add\n                     else\n                         dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)   ! overwrites the zero\n                         dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2 * dp(i-1,0), M)   ! here, dp(i,0) was zero? so becomes 2 * dp_prev0\n                         dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), M)   ! then add to state1\n                     end if\n                  end do\n\n                This matches.\n\n                But note: in the non-zero case, the second block for state0 is:\n\n                  dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2 * dp(i-1,0), M)\n\n                And at that point, dp(i,0) is zero? so it becomes 2 * dp_prev0.\n\n  8. Finally, output = mod(dp(n,0) + dp(n,1), M)\n\nLet me write the entire Fortran program.\n\nNote: We assume the input integer is positive and in the range that the first program expects (1 to 359, as in the problem for atcoder_AGC046_A?).\n\nSteps:\n\n  program main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, count, tmp, i, j, oddCount, M, n, idx, k\n    integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n    character(len=10) :: S1   ! to hold the integer string\n    character(len=6) :: S2    ! either \"First\" or \"Second\"\n    character(len=10) :: buffer   ! for reading\n    integer :: freq(0:9)      ! frequency for digits\n    character :: c\n    integer :: dp(0:6, 0:1)   ! dp table: index 0 to 6 (0 is start) and states 0 and 1.\n\n    ! Read the initial integer\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    ! Step 1: the first program logic\n    count = 0\n    tmp = x\n    x = 0\n    do while (x /= 360)\n        x = x + tmp\n        if (x > 360) then\n            x = x - 360\n        end if\n        count = count + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Step 2: convert count to string\n    write(S1, '(I10)') count   ! writes into a 10-character string, right-aligned with leading spaces\n    ! We want to remove leading spaces? Because the second program counts every character including space? \n    ! But note: the Java program reads the integer and then converts to string? Actually, the first program outputs the integer with `System.out.println(count);` -> so the string has no leading spaces? \n    ! We can adjust: we'll use trim(adjustl(S1))? But note: the Java program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? \n    ! However, the second program in Java reads a string from stdin. The string is the entire line? The first program outputs the integer and then a newline? But the second program uses `bufferedReader.readLine()` which reads the integer without the newline? and without any spaces? \n    ! So we want the string without leading spaces? \n\n    ! Let's do: we adjust to remove leading spaces -> we'll use the trimmed string.\n    S1 = adjustl(S1)   ! left adjust, then we can use the trimmed part.\n\n    ! But note: the string might have trailing spaces? We are going to use the length of the non-space part? \n\n    ! Step 3: count frequency of each character in the string representation (without trailing spaces? but we have left adjusted, so trailing spaces are not present? but we have fixed length? we will use the trimmed length)\n\n    ! However, we have to consider: the integer count might be up to 3 digits? and we have 10 characters? so there are trailing spaces? \n\n    ! We want to consider only the non-space characters? The Java program counts every character in the string. The string we output is the integer without any extra spaces? Actually, the first program outputs the integer as a decimal number without spaces. \n\n    ! How did we write? `write(S1, '(I10)')` gives 10 characters: if the integer is 3 digits, then 7 leading spaces? Then we adjustl: moves the 3 digits to the left and the rest becomes spaces? \n\n    ! But the second program in Java reads the entire line? It will read the integer as a string without the leading spaces? \n\n    ! Actually, we are going to use the entire string? But we want only the digits? We can use the trimmed string? \n\n    ! Let L1 = len_trim(S1)\n\n    L1 = len_trim(S1)\n\n    ! Initialize frequency array\n    freq = 0\n    do i = 1, L1\n        c = S1(i:i)\n        if (c >= '0' .and. c <= '9') then\n            idx = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n            freq(idx) = freq(idx) + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Count the number of digits that have odd frequency\n    oddCount = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        if (mod(freq(i),2) == 1) then\n            oddCount = oddCount + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Then set S2\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)==1) then\n        S2 = \"First\"\n    else\n        S2 = \"Second\"\n    end if\n\n    ! Now, the third program: \n    n = len_trim(S2)   ! n is the length of S2 (without trailing spaces? but we set S2 to either \"First\" or \"Second\", which are 5 and 6, and no trailing spaces? because we assigned a fixed string? \n    ! But note: we defined S2 as character(len=6). So \"First\" has 5 characters: the 6th is space? and \"Second\" has 6. \n    ! We can use n = len_trim(S2) to get the actual length? \n\n    ! Initialize dp: \n    dp = 0   ! set entire array to 0\n    dp(0,0) = 1   ! starting state\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        c = S2(i:i)\n        if (c == '0') then\n            dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n            dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), MOD)\n        else\n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), MOD)\n            dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2 * dp(i-1,0), MOD)   ! because dp(i,0) was 0? \n            dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i-1,1), MOD)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output: \n    write(*,*) mod(dp(n,0) + dp(n,1), MOD)\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: the dp array is indexed from 0 to n? and we are using i from 1 to n? and the state at index n is the final state.\n\nHowever, the Java program uses:\n\n      System.out.println((dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M);\n\nSo we do the same.\n\nBut wait: the Java program uses an array of [n+1] and the state at index n (0-indexed) is the state after processing the entire string.\n\nIn our Fortran, we have:\n\n      dp(0,0:1) -> state at start (before any character)\n      dp(1,0:1) -> after first character\n      ...\n      dp(n,0:1) -> after n characters.\n\nSo we use the state at index n.\n\nBut note: the length of the string is n, and we process from character 1 to n? so state at index n is the final state.\n\nTherefore, the program should be correct.\n\nLet me test with a small input for the chain:\n\n  Input: 90\n\n  Step1: \n        count = 4   (because 90*4=360)\n  Step2: S1 = \"4\" (without quotes, and without spaces? but we write as I10: so S1 = \"         4\" -> then adjustl -> \"4         \" -> then len_trim=1.\n        Frequency: \n            digit '4': freq(4)=1 -> oddCount=1.\n        Then S2 = \"First\"   (because oddCount<=1 -> true)\n\n  Step3: Process the string \"First\" (n=5) with the third program.\n\n        We have to compute the dp for \"First\".\n\n        Let M=1000000007.\n\n        We'll do by hand:\n\n          state0 = 1, state1=0 at start.\n\n          Process 'F' (which is not '0'):\n\n            state1 = (state0_prev + state1_prev) = 1+0 = 1\n            state0 = 0 + 2 * state0_prev = 2*1 = 2\n            state1 = 1 + 2 * state1_prev = 1+0 = 1   -> but wait, we do:\n\n                dp(1,1) = mod(1+0, M) = 1\n                then: \n                dp(1,0) = mod(0 + 2*1, M) = 2\n                dp(1,1) = mod(1 + 2*0, M) = 1\n\n          So after first char: state0=2, state1=1.\n\n          Then 'i' (not '0'):\n\n            state1 = (2+1)=3\n            state0 = 2*2 = 4\n            state1 = 3 + 2*1 = 5\n\n          Then 'r' (not '0'):\n\n            state1 = (4+5)=9\n            state0 = 2*4=8\n            state1 = 9 + 2*5 = 19\n\n          Then 's' (not '0'):\n\n            state1 = (8+19)=27\n            state0 = 2*8=16\n            state1 = 27 + 2*19 = 27+38=65\n\n          Then 't' (not '0'):\n\n            state1 = (16+65)=81\n            state0 = 2*16=32\n            state1 = 81 + 2*65 = 81+130=211\n\n          Then total = 32+211 = 243.\n\n        So the program should output 243.\n\n  But we don't know the expected value? We are replicating the chain.\n\n  We can run the original Java chain? \n\n  However, we are required to write the Fortran program that replicates the chain.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as described.\n\n  One more note: the Java program for the third program uses:\n\n        dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] for the next state.\n\n        We are using:\n\n          dp(i,0) for the state after the i-th character.\n\n        And we start at i=0 as the start state.\n\n        Then the first character (i=1) is the first character of the string.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the string \"First\" has 5 characters, so we use n=5. Then the final state is dp(5,0) and dp(5,1). \n\n  We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n  Also note: the second program sets S2 to either \"First\" or \"Second\". We are using a fixed length of 6, so \"First\" will be stored as \"First \" (with a trailing space) but we use len_trim(S2) which is 5? and we only process the first 5 characters? \n\n  How we assign? \n\n        if (...) then\n            S2 = \"First\"\n        else\n            S2 = \"Second\"\n        end if\n\n  In Fortran, when assigning a string of length 5 to a variable of length 6, it becomes \"First \" (with a space at the end). But we are processing each character by position: \n\n        do i=1, n   ! n = len_trim(S2) = 5 for \"First\"\n\n        So we take the first 5 characters: \n            i=1: 'F'\n            i=2: 'i'\n            i=3: 'r'\n            i=4: 's'\n            i=5: 't'\n\n        The 6th is not used.\n\n  Similarly for \"Second\", we take 6 characters.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Final program:"
