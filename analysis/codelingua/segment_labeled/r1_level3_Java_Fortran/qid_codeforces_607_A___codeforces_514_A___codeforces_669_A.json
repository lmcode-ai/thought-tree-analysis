But note: the Java program builds the list from least significant digit to most. Then it builds the newNumber by:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    pow = 0\n                    for (int i=0; i<list.size(); i++) {\n                         newNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * (long) Math.pow(10, pow);\n                         pow++;\n                    } So the first digit we get (r from the least significant) becomes the pow=0, then next becomes pow=1, etc. We can do the same in Fortran: we don't need to store the list, we can build the newNumber as we go:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    pow = 0\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         ... compute digit ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * (10_8 ** pow)\n                         pow = pow + 1\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But wait: the exponentiation: 10**pow might be inefficient? And also, the exponent pow is increasing. Alternatively, we can build the number by shifting: However, note: the number of digits is small (max 7). So we can do exponentiation. But: 10**pow: we can use a variable that accumulates the power? Or we can avoid exponentiation by building the number in a different way: by starting from the least significant digit, we can do:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    factor = 1\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         ... compute digit ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n                         factor = factor * 10\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But note: the factor might become very large? The maximum factor is 10^(digits) and the maximum digits is 7 -> 10^7 which is 10000000, which is within 8-byte integer? 10^7 is 10 million, which is within the range of 8-byte integer (which can go up to about 10^18). So we can use:\n\n                    integer(kind=8) :: factor\n                    factor = 1\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         r = mod(x,10_8)\n                         ... compute digit as above ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n                         factor = factor * 10\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But note: the condition for the most significant digit: we are checking `x` (the entire number) at the beginning of the iteration.

Then we read n=0, and then we don't read any pairs. Then beacon is all zeros. Then dp(0)=0, then for i from 1 to 1000000: dp(i)=dp(i-1)=0. Then max_val=0, then result1=0. Then the second program: 0 -> 0. Then the third program: 0 -> 0. So it's consistent. We must test with a small example? But we are not allowed to run. One more note: the first program's dp array: the condition for beacon(i) ! =0: if beacon(i) is non-zero, then we set dp(i) accordingly. But note: if beacon(i) is non-zero and beacon(i) < i, then we use the recurrence. But if beacon(i) >= i, then we set dp(i)=1. But note: the recurrence: dp[i] = dp[i - beacon[i] - 1] + 1. We must ensure that the index i - beacon[i] - 1 is nonnegative? The condition beacon[i] < i ensures that i - beacon[i] - 1 >= 0? Actually: if beacon[i] < i, then i - beacon[i] > 0, so i - beacon[i] - 1 >=0? Not necessarily: if beacon[i] = i-1, then index = i - (i-1) - 1 = 0 -> which is valid. If beacon[i] = i-2, then index=1 -> valid. If beacon[i] = 0, then index = i - 0 - 1 = i-1 -> valid for i>=1? But the condition beacon[i] < i: if i=1, then beacon[i] must be 0? Then index = 1-0-1=0 -> valid. But if i=0: we don't go into the loop for i=0? We set dp(0) above. So it's safe. Let's run a tiny example for the first program:\n\n    n=1\n    pair: (0, 0) -> wait, but then beacon[0]=0 -> then dp(0)=0. Then for i=1: beacon[1]=0 -> dp(1)=dp(0)=0 -> max_val=0 -> result1=1-0=1. But what if we have (0,1): then beacon[0]=1 -> dp(0)=1 (max_val=1) -> result1=0. Then the second program: input 0 -> output 0 -> third program: 0 -> output 0. But the original first program: output 0. Now, if the pair is (1,0): then beacon[1]=0 -> dp(1)=dp(0)=0? But we set dp(0)=0 -> so dp(1)=0 -> max_val=0 -> result1=1. Then second program: input 1 -> \n        x=1: r = mod(1,10)=1\n            9-1=8<1? false -> digit=1.\n            newNumber = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\n            factor=10, x=0 -> break. newNumber=1 -> then third program: \n            n2=1 -> result3 = (1/3)*2 = 0 + 1 (because mod(1,3)!=0) -> 1. Then the entire chain outputs 1. But the original chain: \n    First program: output 1 -> becomes input to second: output 1 -> becomes input to third: output 1. So it matches. We'll write the code accordingly. One more note: the second program in Java for input 0: \n    while (x>0) -> doesn't run -> then newNumber=0 -> output 0. So we are safe. We'll code accordingly. But note: the arrays beacon and dp are of size 0:1000000 -> that's 1000001 elements. Fortran can handle that. We'll write the Fortran code accordingly.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (codeforces_607_A) outputs an integer (n - max) and the second program (codeforces_514_A) expects a long integer (x). The third program (codeforces_669_A) then reads an integer (n).\n\nWe must design a single Fortran program that:\n1. Reads the initial input (for the first program) from standard input.\n2. Processes the data through the three steps without intermediate I/O.\n3. Outputs the final result of the third program.\n\nBut note: the first program expects an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers (a and b). The second program expects a single long integer. The third program expects a single integer.\n\nTherefore, the entire input for the chain is the input for the first program.\n\nPlan:\n1. Read the input for the first program: an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers (a, b). We note that in the first program, the array `beacon` is indexed by `a` (which is in the range [0, 1000000]) and the value is `b`.\n\n2. Execute the first program's logic:\n   - We have an array `beacon` of size 0:1000000 (indexed from 0 to 1000000) and a `dp` array of the same size.\n   - Initialize `beacon` to 0? (In Java, arrays are initialized to 0). In Fortran, we can initialize to 0.\n   - Read `n` and then `n` pairs: the first integer of each pair is the index, and the second is the value for `beacon` at that index.\n   - Then compute the `dp` array and the maximum value `max` in `dp` (but note: in the loop, we are updating `max` as we go).\n   - The output of the first program is `n - max` (which we will call `result1`).\n\n3. Then, the second program uses `result1` as its input `x`. However, note the second program expects a long integer. Since `result1` is an integer (and nonnegative), we can convert it to a long integer.\n\n   - The second program's logic: \n        x = result1\n        Then, while x>0, for each digit:\n            r = x % 10\n            if (9 - r) < r then use (9 - r) unless we are at the last digit (i.e., x/10==0) and (9-r)==0, then use r.\n            otherwise use r.\n        Then, form the new number by reversing the list? Actually, the list is built from least significant digit to most. Then we rebuild the number by starting from the least significant digit (so the first element in the list is the units, then tens, etc.).\n\n   - We have to be cautious: the second program uses `long` and the numbers can be large? But note: the first program's output is `n - max` and `n` is at most 1000000, so the value is at most 1000000. Therefore, we can use integer(kind=8) for Fortran to handle the same range as Java long.\n\n   - However, note: the second program might output a number that is then read as an integer by the third program? But the third program reads an integer. So we must ensure that the output of the second program is within integer range? Actually, the second program transforms the digits. Since the input to the second program is at most 1000000 (6-7 digits), the transformed number will be at most 9999999 (7 digits) which is within integer range.\n\n4. The third program takes the output of the second program (call it `result2`) and then computes: \n        (result2 / 3) * 2 + (if result2 mod 3 != 0 then 1 else 0)\n\n   - Then outputs that.\n\nBut note: the third program's function `solve` prints: `(n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`\n\nWe must chain without I/O: so we will store the intermediate results in variables.\n\nImplementation in Fortran:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read the initial `n` and the `n` pairs.\n\n2. Execute the first program (using arrays of size 0 to 1000000).\n\n3. Compute `result1 = n - max`\n\n4. Use `result1` as the input to the second program.\n\n5. Process the digits of `result1` (which is an integer) to form a new integer (or long integer, but then we'll store as integer for the third program?).\n\n6. Then take the result of the second program (call it `result2`) and compute `result3 = (result2 / 3) * 2 + (if mod(result2,3) /= 0 then 1 else 0)`\n\n7. Print `result3`.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `long` for the input and the output. However, since the input `result1` is an integer and the transformed number is built from its digits, we can use a Fortran integer of kind=8 to mimic the Java long. But the third program then reads an integer. However, the transformed number might be within the range of a 32-bit integer? We know the value is at most 9999999 (7 digits) so we can use a 32-bit integer.\n\nBut to be safe and consistent with the Java long, we will use integer(kind=8) for the second program's variables, and then convert to a regular integer for the third program? Or note: the third program uses `int n = ...`. So we can convert the long to int? In Java, if the long is within int range, it's safe. Similarly in Fortran, we can assign an integer(kind=8) to an integer(kind=4) if the value is in range.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the input to the third program is at most 9999999, which is about 10^7, which is within the range of 32-bit integers (which go up to about 2*10^9). So we can use a 32-bit integer for the third program.\n\nBut to be consistent with the Java program, we'll do:\n\n  - Step 1: read n and pairs -> use integer (kind=4) for n and indices, and for the beacon array.\n\n  - Step 2: compute result1 (n - max) -> integer (kind=4) is enough (n<=1000000).\n\n  - Step 3: second program: \n        Let x = result1 (but we need to process as a long? Actually, in Java the second program uses long. But result1 is an integer and we can represent it as an integer(kind=8) to match the Java long.\n\n        We'll use an integer(kind=8) for x and for the newNumber.\n\n  - Step 4: then for the third program, we take newNumber (which is integer(kind=8)) and convert to integer (kind=4) for the third program? But note: the third program uses an integer. And the value is at most 10^7, which is within the range of a 32-bit integer.\n\n  - However, the third program does: n / 3 (integer division) and then multiplies by 2. So we can do that with a 32-bit integer.\n\nBut to be safe, we'll do:\n\n  Let result2 = the newNumber from the second program (as integer(kind=8)), then convert to integer (kind=4) for the third program? But what if the second program produces a number that is too big? It won't because the input is at most 1000000 (7 digits) and the transformed number has the same number of digits. The maximum transformed digit is 9, so the maximum number is 9999999 (if the input was 1000000, then transformed: \n    For 1000000: \n        digit0: 0 -> 9-0=9 -> but then condition: 9-0=9>0 -> but condition: if (9-0<0) -> false -> so we use 0? Actually, no:\n\n        Condition: if (9 - r < r) then ... \n        r=0: 9-0=9, 9<0 is false -> so we use 0.\n\n        Then the next digits: \n        r=0 -> 0\n        r=0 -> 0\n        r=0 -> 0\n        r=0 -> 0\n        r=1 -> then: 9-1=8, 8<1? false -> so we use 1.\n\n        So the number becomes 1000000 -> 1000000? Actually, no: the digits are processed from least to most. So we get the list: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1] -> then the number is 1000000.\n\n        But if we change the digits: for example, if we have 8: then 9-8=1<8 -> so we use 1. So 8 becomes 1. \n\n        The maximum number we can get is 9999999? Actually, the input is 1000000, so the output is 1000000? Then the third program input is 1000000.\n\n        But note: 1000000 is within the range of a 32-bit integer.\n\n  So we can safely convert the integer(kind=8) from the second program to integer(kind=4) for the third program.\n\nAlternatively, we can do the entire chain with integer(kind=4) for the second program? But the second program uses long in Java to avoid overflow? Actually, the input is at most 1000000, which is 6-7 digits, so no overflow in the transformation. We can use integer(kind=4) for the second program as well? But the Java program uses long. To be safe and match the digit processing (like if the number was 10^18, we would need long, but here it's not) we can use integer(kind=8) for the second program and then convert to integer(kind=4) for the third.\n\nBut note: the third program uses integer (32-bit) in Java. So we can safely convert.\n\nImplementation:\n\nWe'll use:\n  integer :: n, i, a, b, max_val, result1\n  integer, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n  beacon and dp are integer arrays of size 0:1000000.\n\nFor the second program:\n  integer(kind=8) :: x, r, newNumber, digit\n  integer(kind=8) :: pow  (but note: the pow is the exponent, but the maximum exponent is 6, so we can use integer, but to avoid type mixing, we use kind=8 for all? Or we can use integer for the exponent because 10^6 is 1000000, which is within 32-bit. But we are multiplying by 10^pow? The maximum newNumber is 10^7, which is 10,000,000 -> so we can use integer(kind=4) for the exponent? Actually, the exponent is at most 6 (since 10^6 is 1e6, and we have at most 7 digits). But to be safe, we can use integer(kind=8) for all variables in the second program.\n\nBut note: the third program only needs an integer.\n\nSo:\n\n  Step 1: read n and the pairs.\n\n  Step 2: initialize beacon and dp arrays.\n\n  Step 3: compute the dp array and max_val.\n\n  Step 4: result1 = n - max_val\n\n  Step 5: set x = int(result1, kind=8)   (to convert to 8-byte integer)\n\n  Step 6: process x to get newNumber (using the second program's logic)\n\n  Step 7: set n2 = int(newNumber, kind=4)   (for the third program)\n\n  Step 8: compute result3 = (n2 / 3) * 2 \n           if (mod(n2,3) /= 0) then result3 = result3 + 1\n\n  Step 9: print result3\n\nBut note: the third program does integer division (like in Java, which truncates toward zero). In Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? Actually, for positive numbers it's the same: 5/3 = 1.\n\nBut note: the third program uses: \n      (n / 3) * 2 + (if n mod 3 != 0 then 1 else 0)\n\nExample: n=1 -> (1/3)=0 -> 0*2=0, then 1 mod 3 !=0 -> 1 -> total=1.\n         n=2 -> (2/3)=0 -> 0, then 1 -> total=1.\n         n=3 -> (3/3)=1 -> 2, then 0 -> total=2.\n         n=4 -> (4/3)=1 -> 2, then 1 -> total=3.\n\nBut wait: \n      (3/3)=1 -> 2, then 0 -> 2.\n      (4/3)=1 -> 2, then 1 -> 3.\n\nBut the formula: (n/3)*2 + (if n%3 !=0 then 1 else 0) is equivalent to:\n        = 2*(n//3) + (if mod(n,3) !=0 then 1 else 0)\n\nIn Fortran, we can do:\n\n        n2 = ... ! integer\n        result3 = (n2 / 3) * 2\n        if (mod(n2, 3) /= 0) then\n            result3 = result3 + 1\n        end if\n\nBut note: the mod function for positive integers is the same as in Java.\n\nHowever, what if n2 is negative? The input to the third program is nonnegative? Yes, because the second program transforms a nonnegative integer (result1) and produces a nonnegative integer.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nNow, let's code accordingly.\n\nImportant: Fortran arrays are 1-indexed by default? But the first program uses indices from 0 to 1000000. We can define:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\nBut note: in Fortran, we must declare the lower bound.\n\nAlso, the first program initializes beacon to 0. In Fortran, we can initialize:\n\n        beacon = 0\n        dp = 0\n\nBut note: the first program does:\n\n        if (beacon[0] != 0) dp[0] = 1;\n\n        for i from 1 to 1000000:\n            if (beacon[i] != 0) then\n                if (beacon[i] < i) then \n                    dp[i] = dp[i - beacon[i] - 1] + 1\n                else \n                    dp[i] = 1\n            else \n                dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n\nWe must be cautious: the condition \"beacon[i] < i\" might be true for i=0? But we start at i=1.\n\nIn Fortran, we can write:\n\n        if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n            dp(0) = 1\n        else\n            dp(0) = 0   ! but in the Java, if beacon[0]==0, then dp[0] remains 0? Actually, the Java code does not set dp[0] in the else. But note: the Java dp array is initialized to 0. So in Fortran, we set dp(0)=0 initially, then conditionally set to 1.\n\n        Then for i from 1 to 1000000.\n\nBut note: the loop in Java: for (int i = 1; i < 1000001; i++) -> i from 1 to 1000000 (inclusive). In Fortran, we can do:\n\n        do i = 1, 1000000\n\nNow, the second program: we have to break the number into digits. How to do that in Fortran? We can use modulo arithmetic.\n\nBut note: the Java program:\n\n        while (x>0) {\n            long r = x % 10;\n            ... \n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n\nWe can do the same in Fortran:\n\n        x = result1   (as int64)\n        digits = 0   ! we'll count the digits? Actually, we are storing the transformed digits in a list, then rebuilding the number.\n\n        But the Java program uses a list. We can use an array? But we don't know the number of digits in advance (max 7). So we can use an array of size 20.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          i = 0\n          do while (x > 0)\n             r = mod(x, 10_8)   ! 10 as integer(kind=8)\n             x = x / 10          ! integer division truncates toward zero for positive numbers.\n\n             if (9 - r < r) then\n                 if (x == 0 .and. (9 - r) == 0) then   ! note: in Java, condition is (x/10==0) meaning after removing the current digit, there are no more? Actually, in the loop condition, we set x = x/10, so at the last digit, x becomes 0 and then we break. But in the condition, we are at the current digit: we have not updated x for the next iteration? \n\n                 Actually, in Java: \n                      long r = x % 10;\n                      if (9 - r < r) {\n                         if (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) ... \n\n                 Here, `x / 10` is the next state? Actually, it is the value of x after removing the last digit? But note: we haven't updated x to x/10 yet. So the condition `x / 10 == 0` means that after we remove this digit, the remaining part is 0? So that condition is equivalent to: the current digit is the most significant digit? \n\n                 In our loop, we are about to set x = x/10, but we haven't. So we can check: if (x / 10 == 0) in Java is the same as: if (x < 10) then ... because x is nonnegative.\n\n                 But note: the condition in Java is `x / 10 == 0` -> which is equivalent to `x < 10`? Actually, for nonnegative integers: if x is in [0,9] then x/10=0. If x>=10, then x/10>=1.\n\n                 So we can do:\n\n                    if (x < 10) then ...   ? But wait: we are at the current digit and x is the current value (which includes the current digit and the rest). Actually, in the loop condition we have the entire x. Then we take r = x % 10, then we set x = x/10. But in the condition, we are checking the current state of x (the entire number) for the condition about being the most significant digit? Actually, no: the condition checks `x / 10` (which is the same as the next state of x) and then we set x to that.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can note: the condition in Java is: if we are going to have x become 0 after removing this digit? Then we are at the most significant digit? \n\n                 So in the loop, at the beginning, x is the entire number. Then we take r = mod(x,10). Then we check: if (9 - r < r) then ... and then we check if (x/10 == 0) meaning that after we remove the last digit, the rest becomes 0? So that condition is: if (x < 10) then ... because if x is less than 10, then x/10 is 0.\n\n                 Therefore, in Fortran:\n\n                    if (9 - r < r) then\n                         if (x < 10 .and. (9 - r == 0)) then   ! but note: in Java, the condition is (x/10 == 0) -> which is (x < 10) for positive x? Actually, x/10==0 means x<=9. Since x is nonnegative.\n\n                 However, note: the condition in Java is `x / 10 == 0` and `x` is a long. So if x is in [0,9] then x/10 is 0.\n\n                 So in Fortran, we can check: if (x < 10) then ... \n\n                 But note: we have to compute the condition before updating x? Actually, in the Java code, the condition is checked on the current x (the entire number). Then we update x to x/10.\n\n                 So in our loop:\n\n                    current_x = x\n                    r = mod(current_x, 10_8)\n                    if (9 - r < r) then\n                         if (current_x < 10 .and. (9 - r == 0)) then   ! then use r\n                         else use 9 - r\n                    else use r\n\n                 Then update x = current_x / 10\n\n                 But note: we are going to update x to current_x/10.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    r = mod(x, 10_8)\n                    temp = x / 10   ! this is the rest of the digits\n\n                 But then we break the loop condition? We are updating x to temp at the end of the iteration.\n\n                 So we can do:\n\n                    r = mod(x, 10_8)\n                    if (9 - r < r) then\n                         if (x < 10 .and. (9 - r == 0)) then   ! because x is the current entire number, so if x<10 then the current digit is the most significant?\n                         Actually, if x is 123, then at the first iteration: x=123, r=3 -> then we check: if 9-3=6<3 -> false -> use 3. Then x becomes 12.\n                         Then next: x=12, r=2 -> false -> use 2 -> then x=1.\n                         Then x=1: r=1 -> 9-1=8>1 -> false -> use 1? But wait: condition: 8>1 -> so false? Actually, condition: 9-1=8 < 1? -> false -> use 1.\n\n                 But the condition is: if (9 - r < r) -> then use 9-r unless ... \n\n                 Actually, for 1: 9-1=8, and 8<1 is false -> so we use 1.\n\n                 Now, consider 9: \n                    x=9: r=9 -> 9-9=0 < 9 -> true -> then check: x<10 -> true and 0==0 -> true -> so we use 9? (because we add r, which is 9).\n\n                 But the condition says: if (9 - r == 0) and we are at the most significant digit, then use r (which is 9). Otherwise, we would use 0? But if we used 0 at the most significant digit, then the number would become 0? But that is not allowed? Actually, the condition is: we don't want the most significant digit to become 0? So we leave it as 9.\n\n                 So in Fortran:\n\n                    if (9_8 - r < r) then\n                         if (x < 10 .and. (9_8 - r == 0)) then\n                             digit = r\n                         else\n                             digit = 9_8 - r\n                         end if\n                    else\n                         digit = r\n                    end if\n\n                 Then we store the digit in an array (or we can build the newNumber by adding digit * 10^pow, where pow starts at 0 and increments).\n\n                 But note: the Java program builds the list from least significant digit to most. Then it builds the newNumber by:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    pow = 0\n                    for (int i=0; i<list.size(); i++) {\n                         newNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * (long) Math.pow(10, pow);\n                         pow++;\n                    }\n\n                 So the first digit we get (r from the least significant) becomes the pow=0, then next becomes pow=1, etc.\n\n                 We can do the same in Fortran: we don't need to store the list, we can build the newNumber as we go:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    pow = 0\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         ... compute digit ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * (10_8 ** pow)\n                         pow = pow + 1\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But wait: the exponentiation: 10**pow might be inefficient? And also, the exponent pow is increasing. Alternatively, we can build the number by shifting:\n\n                 However, note: the number of digits is small (max 7). So we can do exponentiation.\n\n                 But: 10**pow: we can use a variable that accumulates the power? Or we can avoid exponentiation by building the number in a different way: by starting from the least significant digit, we can do:\n\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    factor = 1\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         ... compute digit ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n                         factor = factor * 10\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But note: the factor might become very large? The maximum factor is 10^(digits) and the maximum digits is 7 -> 10^7 which is 10000000, which is within 8-byte integer? 10^7 is 10 million, which is within the range of 8-byte integer (which can go up to about 10^18). So we can use:\n\n                    integer(kind=8) :: factor\n                    factor = 1\n                    newNumber = 0\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         r = mod(x,10_8)\n                         ... compute digit as above ...\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n                         factor = factor * 10\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But note: the condition for the most significant digit: we are checking `x` (the entire number) at the beginning of the iteration. Then we update x at the end. However, we have already taken the last digit via mod? Then we update x to x/10. So the condition `x < 10` in the next iteration? Actually, we are processing the entire number in one iteration per digit.\n\n                 However, we are updating x at the end of the iteration. But we use x in the condition at the beginning of the next iteration. So the condition for the next digit will see x = x_old / 10.\n\n                 But for the current digit, we have the entire x (so the condition for the most significant digit is when the entire x is less than 10? Actually, at the iteration that processes the most significant digit, we have x < 10? Because the next update will set x=0 and the loop will break.\n\n                 However, in the condition for the current digit, we need the entire x to check if it is the most significant? So we have to check at the beginning of the iteration: the current x is the entire number for which we are going to take the last digit? And after taking the last digit, we set x to the rest (which is x/10). So the condition for the most significant digit is: the current x is less than 10? Because then the rest (x/10) will be 0? Actually, if x is in [0,9] then x/10 is 0. But note: we are in the loop only when x>0. So x is at least 1.\n\n                 Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    x_temp = x   ! we don't need to store the entire state? Because we are updating x at the end.\n\n                 Actually, we are using x to get the current digit and then update. The condition for the most significant digit is: if the current x is less than 10? Then after we remove the last digit, the rest becomes 0? So we can use:\n\n                    if (x < 10) then ...\n\n                 This condition is correct.\n\n                 Example: \n                    x=123 -> first iteration: x=123 -> condition: 123>=10 -> so for the digit 3, we are not at the most significant -> so if (9-3<3) -> false -> use 3.\n                    Then x = 123/10 = 12 -> then next iteration: x=12 -> condition: 12>=10 -> not most significant -> then digit 2: use 2.\n                    Then x=1 -> condition: 1<10 -> true -> so for the digit 1: we are at the most significant.\n\n                 So we'll write:\n\n                    do while (x > 0)\n                         r = mod(x, 10_8)\n                         if (9_8 - r < r) then\n                             if (x < 10 .and. (9_8 - r == 0)) then\n                                 digit = r\n                             else\n                                 digit = 9_8 - r\n                             end if\n                         else\n                             digit = r\n                         end if\n                         newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n                         factor = factor * 10\n                         x = x / 10\n                    end do\n\n                 But note: the condition `9_8 - r == 0` only happens when r=9. So we could also write:\n\n                    if (x < 10 .and. r == 9) then ...\n\n                 But we'll write as above for clarity.\n\n5. Then the third program: \n\n        n2 = int(newNumber)   ! convert to default integer (kind=4) for the third program.\n\n        result3 = (n2 / 3) * 2\n        if (mod(n2,3) /= 0) then\n            result3 = result3 + 1\n        end if\n\n        print *, result3\n\nBut note: the first program reads from standard input: first an integer n, then n pairs of integers. How to read in Fortran?\n\n        read(*,*) n\n        do i=1, n\n             read(*,*) a, b\n             beacon(a) = b   ! but note: a must be between 0 and 1000000? The problem says: the array beacon is of size 1000001 (indexed 0 to 1000000). So if a is out of range? The problem says: \"int[] beacon = new int[1000001];\" and then we set beacon[a] = b. So we assume a in [0,1000000].\n\n        We must be cautious: if a is not in [0,1000000]? The problem does not specify, but the array is of size 1000001. So we assume a is in [0,1000000].\n\n        We'll read the pairs.\n\nAlso, we must initialize the arrays:\n\n        beacon(0:1000000) = 0\n        dp(0:1000000) = 0\n\nThen set:\n\n        do i=1, n\n             read(*,*) a, b\n             if (a < 0 .or. a > 1000000) then\n                 ! error? But the problem says the array is that size. We assume a is in range.\n                 ! but let's set only if in range? Or the problem guarantees? We'll assume.\n             end if\n             beacon(a) = b\n        end do\n\nThen the rest.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nWe note: the entire program must be in one Fortran program. We must declare all variables.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! For the first program\n        integer :: n, i, a, b, max_val, result1\n        integer, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n        ! For the second program\n        integer(kind=8) :: x, r, digit, factor, newNumber\n        ! For the third program\n        integer :: n2, result3\n\n        ! Step 1: read input for the first program\n        read(*,*) n\n\n        ! Initialize beacon to 0\n        beacon = 0\n\n        ! Read the n pairs\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a, b\n            if (a >= 0 .and. a <= 1000000) then\n                beacon(a) = b\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 2: compute dp and max_val\n        ! Initialize dp(0)\n        dp(0) = 0\n        if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n            dp(0) = 1\n        end if\n\n        max_val = dp(0)   ! but we will update in the loop\n\n        do i = 1, 1000000\n            if (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n                if (beacon(i) < i) then\n                    dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) - 1) + 1\n                else\n                    dp(i) = 1\n                end if\n            else\n                dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n            end if\n            if (dp(i) > max_val) then\n                max_val = dp(i)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        result1 = n - max_val\n\n        ! Step 3: second program\n        x = int(result1, kind=8)   ! convert to 8-byte integer\n\n        ! If result1 is 0, then the loop won't run -> we need to handle 0? \n        ! In the Java program: if x=0, then the while loop condition (x>0) fails -> so newNumber=0? But we initialized newNumber=0 and factor=1, but then we don't run the loop -> so newNumber=0. That is correct.\n\n        newNumber = 0\n        factor = 1\n        do while (x > 0)\n            r = mod(x, 10_8)\n            if (9_8 - r < r) then\n                if (x < 10 .and. (9_8 - r == 0)) then\n                    digit = r\n                else\n                    digit = 9_8 - r\n                end if\n            else\n                digit = r\n            end if\n            newNumber = newNumber + digit * factor\n            factor = factor * 10\n            x = x / 10\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 4: third program\n        n2 = int(newNumber)   ! convert to default integer (should be within range)\n\n        result3 = (n2 / 3) * 2\n        if (mod(n2, 3) /= 0) then\n            result3 = result3 + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Output the final result\n        print *, result3\n\n        end program combined\n\nBut note: what if result1 is 0? Then the second program produces newNumber=0. Then the third program: \n        n2=0\n        result3 = (0/3)*2 = 0, then mod(0,3)=0 -> so result3=0 -> output 0.\n\nBut the original first program: if n=0? Then we read n=0, and then we don't read any pairs. Then beacon is all zeros. Then dp(0)=0, then for i from 1 to 1000000: dp(i)=dp(i-1)=0. Then max_val=0, then result1=0. Then the second program: 0 -> 0. Then the third program: 0 -> 0. So it's consistent.\n\nWe must test with a small example? But we are not allowed to run.\n\nOne more note: the first program's dp array: the condition for beacon(i) !=0: if beacon(i) is non-zero, then we set dp(i) accordingly. But note: if beacon(i) is non-zero and beacon(i) < i, then we use the recurrence. But if beacon(i) >= i, then we set dp(i)=1.\n\nBut note: the recurrence: dp[i] = dp[i - beacon[i] - 1] + 1. We must ensure that the index i - beacon[i] - 1 is nonnegative? The condition beacon[i] < i ensures that i - beacon[i] - 1 >= 0? Actually: if beacon[i] < i, then i - beacon[i] > 0, so i - beacon[i] - 1 >=0? Not necessarily: if beacon[i] = i-1, then index = i - (i-1) - 1 = 0 -> which is valid. If beacon[i] = i-2, then index=1 -> valid. If beacon[i] = 0, then index = i - 0 - 1 = i-1 -> valid for i>=1? But the condition beacon[i] < i: if i=1, then beacon[i] must be 0? Then index = 1-0-1=0 -> valid.\n\nBut if i=0: we don't go into the loop for i=0? We set dp(0) above.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nLet's run a tiny example for the first program:\n\n    n=1\n    pair: (0, 0) -> wait, but then beacon[0]=0 -> then dp(0)=0.\n    Then for i=1: beacon[1]=0 -> dp(1)=dp(0)=0 -> max_val=0 -> result1=1-0=1.\n\n    But what if we have (0,1): then beacon[0]=1 -> dp(0)=1 (max_val=1) -> result1=0.\n\n    Then the second program: input 0 -> output 0 -> third program: 0 -> output 0.\n\n    But the original first program: output 0.\n\n    Now, if the pair is (1,0): then beacon[1]=0 -> dp(1)=dp(0)=0? But we set dp(0)=0 -> so dp(1)=0 -> max_val=0 -> result1=1.\n\n    Then second program: input 1 -> \n        x=1: \n            r = mod(1,10)=1\n            9-1=8<1? false -> digit=1.\n            newNumber = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\n            factor=10, x=0 -> break.\n        newNumber=1 -> then third program: \n            n2=1 -> result3 = (1/3)*2 = 0 + 1 (because mod(1,3)!=0) -> 1.\n\n    Then the entire chain outputs 1.\n\nBut the original chain: \n    First program: output 1 -> becomes input to second: output 1 -> becomes input to third: output 1.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nOne more note: the second program in Java for input 0: \n    while (x>0) -> doesn't run -> then newNumber=0 -> output 0.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nWe'll code accordingly.\n\nBut note: the arrays beacon and dp are of size 0:1000000 -> that's 1000001 elements. Fortran can handle that.\n\nWe'll write the Fortran code accordingly."
