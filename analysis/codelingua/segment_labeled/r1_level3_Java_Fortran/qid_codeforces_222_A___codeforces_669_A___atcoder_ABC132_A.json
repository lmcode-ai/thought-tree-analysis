Code:\n\n    program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, k, a, l, c, X, Y, i, quotient, remainder\n        character(len=50) :: temp, s\n        integer :: freq(0:255), distinct, ascii, len_s\n        logical :: allTwice\n\n        ! Step 1: read n and k\n        read(*,*) n, k\n\n        ! Initialize for the first program\n        l = 0\n        c = 1\n\n        ! Read the n integers do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a\n            if (a == l) then\n                c = c + 1\n            else\n                c = 1\n            end if\n            l = a\n        end do\n\n        ! Compute X\n        if (c + k > n) then\n            X = n - c\n        else\n            X = -1\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 2: Compute Y from X (second program) quotient = X / 3\n        remainder = mod(X, 3) if (remainder == 0) then\n            Y = 2 * quotient\n        else\n            Y = 2 * quotient + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 3: Convert Y to a string\n        write(temp, *) Y\n        s = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\n        ! Step 4: Process the string s (third program)\n        ! Initialize frequency array\n        freq = 0\n\n        len_s = len_trim(s) do i = 1, len_s\n            ascii = iachar(s(i:i))\n            freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n        end do\n\n        distinct = 0\n        allTwice = .true. do i = 0, 255\n            if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                distinct = distinct + 1\n                if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                    allTwice = .false.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Output\n        if (distinct == 2 .and. allTwice) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n    end program combined\n\n  However, note: the first program uses an initial value l=0. But what if the first integer is 0? Then the first comparison: a (which is the first integer) == l (0) -> true? So c becomes 2? Then if the next integer is 0, then c becomes 3? But the consecutive run at the end: we are counting the consecutive same at the end? Actually, the first program:\n\n            int l = 0, c = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int a = in.nextInt();\n                if (a == l) c += 1;\n                else c = 1;\n                l = a;\n            } So for the first integer: \n            a = first integer, l=0 -> if the first integer is 0, then c becomes 2? But if the first integer is not 0, then c becomes 1. Then at the end, we are counting the consecutive run at the end? Example: Input: n=3, k=?, and integers: [0,0,0]\n            Step1: \n                i0: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=2, l=0. i1: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=3, l=0.\n                i2: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=4, l=0. Then condition: c+k>n -> 4+k>3 -> if k>=0, then true -> output n-c = 3-4 = -1? But wait: c started at 1 and then we added for each consecutive same?",

But the original problem: \n            The first sample: \n                \"7 3\n                 4 3 3 3 2 2 1\" \n                -> output 2.\n\n          How does the code compute: \n                n=7, k=3\n                the integers: [4,3,3,3,2,2,1]\n                l=0, c=1\n                a=4: not 0 -> c=1, l=4. a=3: not 4 -> c=1, l=3. a=3: equals 3 -> c=2, l=3. a=3: equals 3 -> c=3, l=3. a=2: not 3 -> c=1, l=2.\n                a=2: equals 2 -> c=2, l=2. a=1: not 2 -> c=1, l=1. Then c=1, condition: c+k=1+3=4<=7 -> false -> output -1. But sample output is 2. So the code is not for the problem I thought?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The plan:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_222_A) reads integers n and k, then n integers. It counts the consecutive same numbers at the end.\n    Then it computes: if (c + k > n) then output (n - c) else output -1.\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n and then outputs (n/3)*2 + (if n%3==0 then 0 else 1).\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string and checks if there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n However, note the instruction: \n   - Only the first block reads input, and only the last block produces output.\n   - Intermediate steps without I/O.\n\n How to chain?\n   Input for the entire program: \n     First, we have the input for the first program: n, k, then n integers.\n     Then the output of the first program (which is either an integer or -1) becomes the input for the second program? \n        But the second program expects a single integer (n). \n     Then the output of the second program becomes the input for the third? But the third expects a string.\n\n But wait: the original chain is three separate programs. The output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n However, the outputs of the first two are integers, and the third expects a string.\n\n How do we reconcile? \n\n Let's reexamine the problem: \n   \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So:\n   Program 1: outputs either an integer (n-c) or -1 -> as a string? (without any extra text, just the number or -1)\n   Program 2: reads that integer (if the first program outputs -1, then the second program gets -1) and then outputs an integer (computed by (n/3)*2 + (n%3==0?0:1)).\n   Program 3: reads the integer output by the second program? But the third program expects a string of 4 letters.\n\n This doesn't chain naturally because the types and meaning of the data are different.\n\n Therefore, we must assume that the chain is independent? But the problem states they are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that we are given three separate programs and we are to combine them as if they are three steps on the same input? \n\n But the inputs are different.\n\n After reading the problem again: \n   \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. The output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third. The final output is the output of the third.\n\n However, the second program expects a single integer, and the first program outputs an integer (either a nonnegative number or -1). The third program expects a string, but the second program outputs an integer.\n\n This type mismatch is a problem.\n\n We must reinterpret: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". But the chain as described would break at the second program if the first program outputs a negative number? And then the third program would break because it expects a string.\n\n Alternatively, note that the three programs are independent and solve different problems. The chain might be intended to be run on the same initial input? But that doesn't make sense because they require different inputs.\n\n Let me look at the programs again:\n\n Program 1: \n   Input: first two integers: n, k. Then n integers.\n   Output: either (n-c) or -1.\n\n Program 2:\n   Input: one integer n.\n   Output: an integer = (n/3)*2 + (if n mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0)\n\n Program 3:\n   Input: a string.\n\n How can the output of program1 (an integer) be the input to program2? That matches: program2 takes one integer.\n\n How can the output of program2 (an integer) be the input to program3? It expects a string. We must convert the integer to a string? \n\n But note: the third program expects a string of exactly 4 characters? Actually, it can be any string. It counts the frequency of each character and checks that there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n So if we convert the integer to a string, then the third program will check that string.\n\n However, the original chain would be:\n\n   $ java codeforces_222_A\n        input: [n, k, then n integers] -> outputs an integer (say X)\n\n   $ java codeforces_669_A\n        input: X -> outputs an integer (say Y)\n\n   $ java atcoder_ABC132_A\n        input: Y (but Y is an integer, so we must convert Y to a string? But the program expects a string of digits? And then it checks if the string of digits has exactly two distinct digits and each appears twice? \n\n But note: the third program does not require the string to be of length 4? It can be any length. However, the condition is:\n        - There are exactly two distinct characters.\n        - Each of these two characters appears exactly twice.\n\n So the string must have length 4? Actually, no: it could have more than 4? But if there are two distinct characters and each appears twice, then the length must be 4.\n\n However, the output of the second program might be a multi-digit integer? Then the string would have more than 4 characters? Then the condition (each distinct char twice and two distinct) would require exactly 4 characters? \n\n This is a problem: the integer output by the second program might be any integer. How often is it a 4-digit number with exactly two distinct digits and each digit appearing twice? Almost never.\n\n Therefore, it seems the chain as described by the problem might not be intended to run on the same initial data? \n\n But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n So we have to do:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program on the initial input (n, k, and then n integers). Let the output be X (an integer).\n   Step 2: Run the second program on input X. Let the output be Y (an integer).\n   Step 3: Run the third program on input the string representation of Y.\n\n However, note the third program: \n        It reads a string and then checks: \n          - The string must have exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n The output of the third program is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Therefore, the entire chain's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But wait: the first program outputs either an integer (nonnegative) or -1. Then the second program:\n        If we run the second program on -1: \n            n = -1\n            n/3 = -1 (integer division truncates toward 0? In Java, for negative, it truncates toward 0? Actually, in Java: -1/3 is 0? Let me check: \n                In Java: -1 / 3 is 0? Actually, no: integer division in Java truncates toward 0. So -1/3 is 0? \n                Actually: -1 / 3 is 0? Because 3 * 0 = 0 which is greater than -1? But that would be floor division? \n                Actually, in Java: integer division rounds toward zero. So -1/3 is 0? \n                But then: (n/3)*2 = 0, and n%3 is -1 mod 3? In Java, the remainder has the same sign as the dividend. So -1 % 3 is -1.\n                Then the expression: 0 * 2 + (n%3==0?0:1) = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n        Then we run the third program on the string \"1\": \n            The string \"1\" has one distinct character and it appears once -> output \"No\".\n\n        Alternatively, if the first program outputs a nonnegative integer, then we convert that to a string and run the third program? \n\n How to do in Fortran?\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Read the initial input: first two integers (n, k) and then n integers.\n\n  2. Process the first program: \n        l = 0, c = 1\n        do i = 1, n\n            read the next integer a\n            if (a == l) then\n                c = c + 1\n            else\n                c = 1\n            endif\n            l = a\n        end do\n\n        if (c + k > n) then\n            X = n - c\n        else\n            X = -1\n        endif\n\n  3. Now, use X as input to the second program:\n        n2 = X   (the output of the first program)\n        Then compute: \n            quotient = n2 / 3   (integer division, truncates toward zero? Fortran integer division truncates toward zero? Actually, it truncates toward the next lower integer? But note: for positive it truncates, for negative it truncates toward zero? Actually, Fortran standard says: integer division truncates toward zero? \n            But let me check: in Fortran, 5/2 = 2, -5/2 = -2? Actually, it truncates toward zero? \n            However, we have to mimic Java: which truncates toward zero.\n\n        But note: the second program in Java: \n            (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)\n\n        How to compute in Fortran?\n            Let quotient = n2 / 3   (this is integer division in Fortran, truncating toward zero? Actually, for negative: \n                Fortran: -1/3 -> 0? Because 0 is the integer part? \n                But: -1 divided by 3 is -0.333... -> truncation toward zero gives 0? \n                However, note: in Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? Actually, the standard says: \n                    \"The result of an integer division is the integer closest to the quotient and between zero and the quotient inclusively.\"\n                Actually, it truncates toward zero? \n\n            Then remainder = mod(n2, 3)   -> but mod in Fortran: for negative, it returns a nonnegative remainder? \n                Actually, the MOD function in Fortran: \n                    MOD(8,5)=3, MOD(-8,5)=-3? \n                But we want the modulus as in the condition: (n % 3 == 0) -> in Java, the remainder has the same sign as the dividend.\n\n            We need to mimic Java's behavior. In Java, the condition (n % 3 == 0) is true only if n is divisible by 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            if (n2 >= 0) then\n                remainder = mod(n2, 3)\n            else\n                ! For negative: we want remainder such that (n2 = 3 * quotient + remainder) with |remainder| < 3 and the sign of remainder same as n2?\n                ! But Java: -1 % 3 -> -1, and -4 % 3 -> -1? \n                ! We can compute: \n                remainder = mod(n2, 3)\n                ! But Fortran's MOD with negative: \n                !   MOD(-1, 3) = -1   -> because: -1 = 3 * (-1) + 2? But Fortran's MOD(-1,3) returns 2? \n                !   Actually, Fortran has MOD and MODULO: MOD gives the remainder with the same sign as the first argument? \n                !   MOD(A,P) for integer: \n                !       MOD(8,5)=3, MOD(-8,5)=-3? Actually, no: \n                !   According to gfortran: \n                !       MOD(10,3)=1, MOD(-10,3)= -1? \n                !   Actually: \n                !       MOD(A,P) = A - INT(A/P)*P\n                !       For A=-10, P=3: INT(-10/3) is -4? But wait: -10/3 is -3.333 -> truncation toward zero gives -3? Then MOD(-10,3) = -10 - (-3)*3 = -10 +9 = -1? \n                !   Actually, Fortran truncates integer division toward zero? Then MOD(-10,3) = -1, which is the same as Java? \n                !   But what about MOD(-1,3)? = -1 - (INT(-1/3)*3) = -1 - (0)*3 = -1? \n                !   So yes, MOD in Fortran for integers gives the same remainder as Java? \n\n                So we can compute: \n                    remainder = mod(n2, 3)\n\n            Then: \n                if (remainder == 0) then\n                    Y = (n2/3)*2\n                else\n                    Y = (n2/3)*2 + 1\n                endif\n\n        However, note: the expression in Java: (n/3)*2 + (n%3==0?0:1) \n            =  (n2/3)*2 + (if remainder==0 then 0 else 1)\n\n        But wait: the Java program uses integer arithmetic. We are doing the same.\n\n        So: \n            quotient = n2 / 3   ! integer division\n            remainder = mod(n2, 3)\n            if (remainder == 0) then\n                Y = 2 * quotient\n            else\n                Y = 2 * quotient + 1\n            endif\n\n        However, note: the original Java program does: \n            System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n\n        So we have that.\n\n  4. Now, take Y (an integer) and convert it to a string. Then run the third program on that string.\n\n        Steps for the third program:\n            Let s = the string representation of Y.\n\n            We need to check:\n                - The string s must have exactly two distinct characters.\n                - Each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n\n            But note: the string might have more than 4 characters? Then it's impossible to have two distinct characters each twice? \n                Because total length would be 4? Actually, the condition is that each distinct character that is in the string must appear twice? And there must be exactly two distinct characters? \n                So the string must have exactly 4 characters? Actually, no: if there are two distinct characters, and each appears twice, then the total length is 4? \n\n            However, the string we get from Y might have any length. For example, if Y=1, then the string is \"1\" (length 1). \n            Then we have only one distinct character -> fails.\n\n            How about if Y=1122? Then the string is \"1122\" -> two distinct: '1' and '2', each twice -> output \"Yes\".\n\n            But note: the program does not require the string to be of length 4? It just counts the frequency of each character. \n            However, if the string has more than 4 characters, then we cannot have two distinct characters and each appearing exactly twice? \n            Because the total frequency would be 2+2=4, so the string must be of length 4? \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: If the length of the string is not 4, then output \"No\".\n\n                Step 2: Otherwise, count the frequency of each character. \n                    There must be exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n            But note: the original program does not check the length? It just counts. So if the string has more than 4, then we have more than 4 characters? \n                Example: \"aabb\" -> two distinct, each twice -> that's 4 characters -> valid.\n                What about \"aabc\"? -> three distinct -> invalid.\n\n            Actually, the program: \n                It iterates over the string and builds a frequency map.\n                Then it checks: for every entry in the map, the value must be 2? \n                And then it checks: if (ok and map.size()==2) -> then output \"Yes\".\n\n            So if the string has 5 characters? Then we have at least one character that does not appear twice? Then ok becomes false.\n\n            And also, if the string has 3 characters? Then we have at most 3 distinct? Then map.size() would be 1,2, or 3? But we require 2 -> fails.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Build a frequency map for the string.\n\n                Conditions:\n                  - The map must have exactly 2 entries.\n                  - For each entry, the frequency must be 2.\n\n            However, note: what if the string has 4 characters? but with three distinct? e.g., \"aabc\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> then we break at the first non-2 -> condition fails.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                integer, dimension(0:255) :: freq   ! we can use an array for ASCII, but note: the string is from an integer -> digits? But wait, what if the integer is negative? \n                Then the string would have a minus sign? \n\n            Example: \n                If Y = -1, then the string is \"-1\" -> two characters: '-' and '1'. \n                Then we have: \n                    freq('-') = 1, freq('1') = 1 -> not 2 -> fails.\n\n            How about if Y = -11? Then the string is \"-11\": \n                distinct: '-' and '1'. \n                freq: \n                    '-' -> 1\n                    '1' -> 2 -> then we have one character with 2 and one with 1 -> fails.\n\n            How about if Y = 1122? -> \"1122\": two distinct, each twice -> passes.\n\n            How about if Y = 12? -> \"12\": two distinct, each once -> fails.\n\n            How about if Y = 1212? -> \"1212\": two distinct: '1' and '2', each twice -> passes.\n\n            But note: the original program does not require the string to be of length 4? It can be any length? \n                However, the condition that each distinct character appears twice and there are exactly two distinct characters implies the string length is 4.\n\n            So we can also check: if the length is not 4, then we can immediately set ok = .false. and skip the frequency count? \n\n            But the original program does not do that. It counts anyway. So we should do the same.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Let s = the string representation of Y (without any extra spaces, just the integer as a string)\n\n                Initialize a frequency array for characters? Or we can use a loop to count.\n\n                Since the string might be long? But the integer Y might be large? But the chain: \n                    The first program: n and k, then n integers. Then the output X: in the range [ -1, n] (since n-c, and c>=1, so at most n-1). \n                    Then the second program: Y = (X/3)*2 + (if mod(X,3)!=0 then 1). \n                    The maximum absolute value of X is at most n (or -1). Then the absolute value of Y is at most about (n/3)*2 + 1, which is about 2*n/3. \n                    The number of digits in Y is about log10(2*n/3) + 1. For n up to ... the first program reads n which is the first integer, so it might be large? \n\n                But we are not given constraints. We have to be efficient? The string length is small? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use a hash map? But Fortran doesn't have built-in. We can use a fixed-size array for ASCII? \n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let len = LEN_TRIM(s)   ? But note: the string we create from the integer might not have spaces? We create it without spaces.\n\n                  Actually, we can write the integer to a character variable using an internal write.\n\n                  Then, we can do:\n\n                    integer :: i, ascii\n                    integer, dimension(0:255) :: freq = 0   ! if we assume ASCII\n\n                  But what if the integer is negative? Then we have the minus sign? \n\n                  We traverse each character in the string.\n\n                  Then we build freq array:\n\n                    do i = 1, len\n                        ch = s(i:i)\n                        ascii = iachar(ch)\n                        freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n                    end do\n\n                  Then we traverse the freq array? But we don't know which characters appeared? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can:\n\n                    distinct = 0\n                    allTwice = .true.\n\n                    do i = 0, 255\n                        if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                            distinct = distinct + 1\n                            if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                                allTwice = .false.\n                            endif\n                        endif\n                    end do\n\n                  Then check: \n                    if (distinct == 2 .and. allTwice) then\n                        print*, \"Yes\"\n                    else\n                        print*, \"No\"\n                    endif\n\n                  But wait: the condition in the original program: \n                    It checks that every character in the map has frequency 2? \n                    But the above does: \n                        We count the distinct characters and we check that each distinct character has frequency 2? \n                    However, note: the above loop sets allTwice to false if any distinct character does not have frequency 2. \n\n                  But the condition in the original program: \n                    for (Entry<Character, Integer> c : map.entrySet()) {\n                        if (c.getValue() != 2) {\n                            ok = false;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                  And then also checks that the map size is 2.\n\n                  So we are doing the same.\n\n            However, note: the original program does not require the entire string to be of length 4? It just requires that every distinct character appears twice? \n                But if the string has a character that appears 3 times? Then we break. \n\n            Example: \"1111\": \n                distinct = 1 (only '1') -> distinct==1 -> fails.\n\n            Example: \"1122\": distinct=2, and each character has frequency 2 -> passes.\n\n            Example: \"1112\": \n                distinct=2: '1' and '2'\n                but '1' has frequency 3 -> so we set allTwice = false -> fails.\n\n            This matches.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n    We need to write the integer Y to a string. How?\n\n        We can use:\n\n          character(len=50) :: str\n          write(str, *) Y\n\n        But this will write with a leading space (if positive) or a minus (if negative) and then the digits. \n        Also, it may have trailing spaces? And the format is fixed? \n\n        We can then remove leading and trailing spaces? \n\n        Actually, we want the exact string representation? \n\n        We can use:\n\n          write(str, '(I0)') Y   ! I0 means integer with no leading spaces? \n\n        But note: the integer might be negative? Then the minus sign is included.\n\n        Then we can set:\n\n          s = trim(adjustl(str))   ? Actually, the I0 format should write without leading spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          character(len=50) :: temp\n          write(temp, *) Y\n          s = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\n        But adjustl removes leading spaces? \n\n        Example: \n            Y = 123 -> temp = \"         123\" -> adjustl moves to the left -> then trim removes trailing spaces.\n\n        However, the I0 format is better? But not all Fortran compilers support? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          write(str, *) Y\n          s = trim(adjustl(str))\n\n        This should give the integer without leading spaces? \n\n        But note: if Y is negative, then the minus sign is the first character? Then adjustl will leave the minus at the beginning? \n\n        Example: Y=-1 -> str = \"        -1\" -> adjustl becomes \"-1         \" -> trim becomes \"-1\"\n\n        This is the string we want.\n\n  Summary:\n\n    Steps in Fortran:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, k, then n integers.\n\n      Step 2: Process the n integers to compute c (the consecutive same at the end) and then X.\n\n      Step 3: Compute Y from X (using the second program's logic).\n\n      Step 4: Convert Y to a string s.\n\n      Step 5: Process the string s with the third program's logic to check the frequency condition.\n\n      Step 6: Output either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n  Note: The entire chain's output is the output of the third program.\n\n  But note: the original chain would output:\n\n      First program: outputs an integer (or -1) -> then the second program outputs an integer -> then the third program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n  So the final output of the chain is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n      Reads: first two integers (n, k) and then n integers.\n\n      Then does:\n\n        ! Step 1: process the n integers to compute X\n        l = 0\n        c = 1\n        do i = 1, n\n            read*, a   ! we are reading from the same input? But we already read n and k? Then the next n integers.\n\n        But wait: the entire input is read at the beginning? \n\n        How to structure the reading?\n\n          We read the first two integers: n, k.\n\n          Then we read n integers. We can store them? Or we can process on the fly? \n\n          The first program processes the integers one by one and only needs the last consecutive run.\n\n          So we don't need to store the entire array? \n\n        So:\n\n          integer :: n, k, a, l, c, X, Y, i\n          read(*,*) n, k\n\n          l = 0   ! but what if the first integer is 0? then we get a==l? \n          c = 1\n\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) a\n              if (a == l) then\n                  c = c + 1\n              else\n                  c = 1\n              endif\n              l = a\n          enddo\n\n          if (c + k > n) then\n              X = n - c\n          else\n              X = -1\n          endif\n\n        Step 3: Compute Y from X.\n\n          integer :: quotient, remainder\n          quotient = X / 3\n          remainder = mod(X, 3)\n\n          if (remainder == 0) then\n              Y = 2 * quotient\n          else\n              Y = 2 * quotient + 1\n          endif\n\n        Step 4: Convert Y to a string.\n\n          character(len=50) :: temp, s\n          write(temp, *) Y\n          s = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\n        Step 5: Process the string s.\n\n          integer :: freq(0:255) = 0, distinct, i, ascii\n          logical :: allTwice\n          integer :: len_s\n\n          len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n          ! Initialize freq to zero? already set to zero.\n\n          do i = 1, len_s\n              ascii = iachar(s(i:i))\n              freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n          enddo\n\n          distinct = 0\n          allTwice = .true.\n\n          do i = 0, 255\n              if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                  distinct = distinct + 1\n                  if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                      allTwice = .false.\n                  endif\n              endif\n          enddo\n\n          if (distinct == 2 .and. allTwice) then\n              write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n          else\n              write(*,*) \"No\"\n          endif\n\n  However, note: the condition in the original program: \n        if (ok && map.size() == 2) \n        where ok is set by checking that every entry has value 2.\n\n        We are checking: distinct==2 and allTwice. \n\n        But what if there are two distinct characters, but one of them does not appear twice? Then allTwice is false -> condition fails. \n\n        And if distinct==2 and allTwice is true -> condition passes.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  But note: what if the string is empty? Then distinct=0 -> condition fails.\n\n  Also, the integer Y might be zero? Then s = \"0\", distinct=1 -> fails.\n\n  This is the intended behavior.\n\n  However, note: the second program: \n        If X is negative? Then Y might be negative? Then the string will have a minus sign? \n\n  Example: X = -1 -> \n        quotient = -1/3 = 0? (in Fortran: -1/3=0? because truncation toward zero: 0 is the integer part? \n        remainder = mod(-1,3) = -1? \n        Then Y = 2*0 + 1 = 1.\n\n        Actually, wait: \n            In Java: \n                (-1)/3 = 0? -> no: in Java, integer division truncates toward zero? \n                Actually, in Java: -1/3 is 0? \n                But: -1 divided by 3 is -0.333... -> truncation toward zero is 0? \n                Then: (-1) % 3 = -1? \n                So: 0*2 + (if remainder==0? then 0 else 1) = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n        So we did: \n            quotient = X/3 = -1/3 -> in Fortran: integer division truncates toward zero? \n            -1/3 in Fortran: \n                According to the standard: the result is the integer closest to the quotient and between zero and the quotient? \n                Actually, truncation toward zero: so -1/3 -> 0? \n            Then remainder = mod(-1,3) = -1? \n            Then we do: if (remainder==0) ... else ... -> we add 1 -> Y=1.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Then the string is \"1\", which is one distinct character -> fails.\n\n  Therefore, the code.\n\n  Let's write the entire Fortran program.\n\n  Note: We are reading from standard input. We write to standard output only at the end.\n\n  We assume the input integers are within the range of default integers.\n\n  Code:\n\n    program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, k, a, l, c, X, Y, i, quotient, remainder\n        character(len=50) :: temp, s\n        integer :: freq(0:255), distinct, ascii, len_s\n        logical :: allTwice\n\n        ! Step 1: read n and k\n        read(*,*) n, k\n\n        ! Initialize for the first program\n        l = 0\n        c = 1\n\n        !

Compute X\n        if (c + k > n) then\n            X = n - c\n        else\n            X = -1\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 2: Compute Y from X (second program)\n        quotient = X / 3\n        remainder = mod(X, 3)\n        if (remainder == 0) then\n            Y = 2 * quotient\n        else\n            Y = 2 * quotient + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 3: Convert Y to a string\n        write(temp, *) Y\n        s = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\n        ! Step 4: Process the string s (third program)\n        ! Initialize frequency array\n        freq = 0\n\n        len_s = len_trim(s)\n        do i = 1, len_s\n            ascii = iachar(s(i:i))\n            freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n        end do\n\n        distinct = 0\n        allTwice = .true.\n        do i = 0, 255\n            if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                distinct = distinct + 1\n                if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                    allTwice = .false.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Output\n        if (distinct == 2 .and. allTwice) then\n            write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*,*) \"No\"\n        end if\n    end program combined\n\n  However, note: the first program uses an initial value l=0. But what if the first integer is 0? \n        Then the first comparison: a (which is the first integer) == l (0) -> true? \n        So c becomes 2? \n\n        Then if the next integer is 0, then c becomes 3? \n\n        But the consecutive run at the end: we are counting the consecutive same at the end? \n\n        Actually, the first program:\n\n            int l = 0, c = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int a = in.nextInt();\n                if (a == l) c += 1;\n                else c = 1;\n                l = a;\n            }\n\n        So for the first integer: \n            a = first integer, l=0 -> if the first integer is 0, then c becomes 2? \n            But if the first integer is not 0, then c becomes 1.\n\n        Then at the end, we are counting the consecutive run at the end? \n\n        Example: \n            Input: n=3, k=?, and integers: [0,0,0]\n            Step1: \n                i0: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=2, l=0.\n                i1: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=3, l=0.\n                i2: a=0 -> equals l (0) -> c=4, l=0.\n\n            Then condition: c+k>n -> 4+k>3 -> if k>=0, then true -> output n-c = 3-4 = -1? \n\n        But wait: c started at 1 and then we added for each consecutive same? \n\n        Actually, the consecutive run at the end: the entire array is the same? \n\n        But the count c at the end is 4? which is one more than the length? \n\n        How about if we have [1,2,3]? \n            Start: l=0, c=1.\n            a=1: not 0 -> c=1 -> then l=1.\n            a=2: not 1 -> c=1 -> l=2.\n            a=3: not 2 -> c=1 -> l=3.\n\n            Then condition: c=1, then 1+k>n? -> if k>=n? \n\n        This doesn't seem to match the intended? \n\n        The problem of the first program: \n            It counts the consecutive run at the end? \n\n        But note: the variable c is reset to 1 when a new number appears. So at the end, c is the length of the consecutive run at the end.\n\n        However, the initial state: \n            l=0, c=1.\n\n        Then the first number: \n            if the first number is 0, then it becomes 2? -> but that counts the first element as the second in the run? \n\n        Actually, we want the consecutive run at the end to be counted without any initial condition.\n\n        The original program in Java: \n            It starts with l=0? But the first number might not be 0? \n\n        This seems to be a bug? \n\n        But note: the problem statement of the first program? \n\n        From the code: \n            It's from codeforces_222_A -> we can recall: \n                Problem: A. Solitaire\n\n            But without context, we have to rely on the code.\n\n        How to fix? \n\n          The consecutive run at the end should be the number of consecutive same numbers starting from the last element and going backward.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            c = 1\n            l = a (the last element) -> but we don't have the array stored.\n\n          Actually, the program does:\n\n            It reads the entire sequence and updates l to the current a. And at the end, l is the last element and c is the consecutive run at the end.\n\n          But the initial state: \n            l=0, c=1.\n\n          Then the first element a0: \n            if a0==0 -> c=2 -> which is wrong because we haven't seen 0 before? \n\n          So the initial state should be: \n            l = the first element? \n\n          But then how? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            read the first element -> set l = that element, c=1.\n\n          Then for the next n-1 elements.\n\n          How the original Java code handles the first element? \n\n            It reads the first element: \n                a = first element.\n                compares with l (which is 0) -> if the first element is 0, then c becomes 2? -> which is wrong.\n\n          This suggests the original Java code might be flawed? \n\n          But let me check: the problem \"codeforces 222 A\" -> I recall: \n              The problem: \n                  There is a sequence of n integers. You can do an operation: remove the first element and append it to the end. \n                  You want to have the entire sequence of the last k elements to be the same. \n                  What is the minimum number of operations? \n\n          And the solution: \n              Count the consecutive same numbers at the end. \n              Let c be the consecutive same numbers at the end (at least 1 for the last element).\n              Then if the entire array is the same, then c = n.\n              Now, if we remove the first element and append it to the end, we can only change the beginning? \n\n          Actually, the solution in the code: \n              It says: \n                  if (c + k > n) then output (n - c) \n                  else output -1.\n\n          Why? \n\n          Condition: after some moves, the last k elements must be the same. \n          The consecutive run at the end must be at least k? \n\n          Actually, the consecutive run at the end must be at least k? \n\n          Then the condition: if the consecutive run at the end (c) is at least k? \n          But the code: \n                if (c + k > n) ... \n\n          What does that mean? \n\n          Example: \n            n=5, k=2, and the array: [1,2,3,3,3] -> consecutive run at the end: 3,3,3 -> c=3.\n            Then condition: c+k = 3+2=5 > n=5? -> false -> output -1? \n\n          But wait: we require the last k=2 to be the same. They are 3 and 3 -> same. \n\n          So why output -1? \n\n          Actually, the problem might be: we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily? \n\n          After checking: \n            The problem: \n                \"One move consists of removing the card on the top of the deck and placing it on the bottom of the deck. \n                 Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to make some k of the last cards of the deck have the same number?\"\n\n          And the solution: \n              If the entire deck is the same, then we don't need any moves? \n              Otherwise, we need to remove the first (n - c) moves? \n\n          Condition for possibility: \n              The consecutive run at the end must be at least k? Then we can do (n - c) moves? \n              Otherwise, it's impossible? -> output -1.\n\n          But the code: \n                if (c + k > n) \n                    then output (n - c)\n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          Why? \n\n          If we have a consecutive run at the end of length c, then we require that the entire segment from the (n-c)th to the end is the same? \n          And we want the last k to be the same. \n\n          Condition: if c >= k, then we can do (n - c) moves? \n          But the code condition: c + k > n -> which implies c > n - k.\n\n          Then the consecutive run at the end is longer than n-k? meaning the last k are included in the consecutive run? \n\n          So if c >= k, then the last k are the same? Then we can do at most (n - c) moves? \n\n          However, note: we don't necessarily need to remove all the non-consecutive part? \n\n          Actually, the solution: \n              The minimum number of moves is (n - c) if the consecutive run at the end is at least k? \n              Otherwise, it's impossible? \n\n          But the condition in the code: \n                if (c + k > n) \n                    then output (n-c) \n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          Why c + k > n? \n\n          Note: \n            c + k > n   =>   c > n - k.\n\n          And n - k is the maximum number of moves we can do without affecting the last k? \n\n          Actually, if we remove (n - k) cards, then the last k become the entire deck? \n\n          But we require that the last k are the same. \n\n          If the consecutive run at the end is at least k, then we can leave the last k as the same? \n\n          How many moves are needed? \n            We need to remove the first (n - c) cards? because then the last c cards remain? and the last k are included? \n\n          But note: we can do fewer moves? \n\n          Actually, the solution might be: \n            The condition for possibility is that the consecutive run at the end is at least k? \n            Then the answer is (n - c) moves? \n\n          Then why the condition c+k>n? \n\n          Actually, if c >= k, then we can do (n - c) moves? \n          But note: if we do (n - c) moves, then the consecutive run at the end (of length c) becomes at the end? and then the last k are the same? \n\n          So the condition should be: \n                if (c >= k) then \n                    output (n - c) \n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          But the code: \n                if (c + k > n) \n                    then output (n-c)\n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          How is that equivalent? \n\n          Condition: \n                c + k > n   <=>   c > n - k\n\n          But note: if c >= k, then c > n - k? \n            Not necessarily: if n=5, k=3, c=3 -> then 3+3=6>5 -> true -> output 5-3=2.\n          But if n=5, k=2, c=2 -> 2+2=4 <=5 -> false -> output -1? \n          But wait: if the consecutive run at the end is 2 and k=2, then the last two are the same -> we should output (n-c)=3? \n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          Actually, the problem: \n            The consecutive run at the end must be at least k? \n\n          So the condition should be: \n                if (c >= k) then \n                    output (n - c) \n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          But the code uses: \n                if (c + k > n) ...\n\n          How about: \n                if (c >= k) then \n                    then c >= k -> then c + k >= k + k = 2k? \n                    but we don't know if 2k > n? \n\n          Therefore, the original Java program might be wrong? \n\n          After checking: \n            I found the original problem: \n                http://codeforces.com/contest/222/problem/A\n\n            The solution: \n                The condition is: \n                  if (c + k > n)   -> then we can remove the first (n-c) moves? \n                else it's impossible? \n\n          Why? \n\n          Explanation from the editorial: \n            After some moves, the last k elements must be the same. \n            The entire sequence after the moves must be: [ ... , x, x, ..., x] (with k x's at the end) \n            And the consecutive run of x's at the end must be at least k? \n\n          But note: we can have more than k x's? \n\n          Condition: \n            The entire deck must have at least k x's at the end? \n\n          How many moves? \n            We can remove the cards until the last k are the same and the card just before the last k is not x? \n\n          Actually, we can have the entire deck being x's? then we remove all the way until the last k? \n\n          The solution in the code: \n            Count the consecutive run at the end (c). \n            Then the condition: \n                if the consecutive run at the end is at least k? \n                    then we can remove the first (n - c) cards? \n                else \n                    we can try to see if there is a card that appears at least k times at the end? \n\n          But note: if the consecutive run at the end is less than k, then even if there are k x's at the end (but not consecutive) it's not enough? \n                because the problem requires the last k to be the same? \n\n          Actually, the problem requires the last k to be the same. They must be consecutive? \n\n          The problem says: \"some k of the last cards\" -> meaning the last k cards? \n\n          So they are consecutive by the deck order.\n\n          Therefore, the consecutive run at the end must be at least k? \n\n          So the condition should be: \n                if (c >= k) then \n                    moves = n - c   (because we remove until the consecutive run at the end becomes the last k, and we leave the last c untouched? \n                else \n                    moves = -1 (impossible)\n\n          But the code condition: \n                if (c + k > n) \n                    then output (n-c) \n                else \n                    output -1\n\n          How is c + k > n equivalent to c>=k? \n            c + k > n  ->  c > n - k.\n            But if c >= k, then c > n - k? \n                c >= k  and  k <= n  -> then c >= k >= 0, but n-k might be large.\n\n          Example: \n            n=5, k=3, c=3: \n                c>=k -> true -> should output 2.\n                condition: 3+3>5 -> true -> output 2.\n\n            n=5, k=2, c=2: \n                c>=k -> true -> should output 3.\n                condition: 2+2>5 -> false -> output -1 -> this is wrong.\n\n          Therefore, the condition in the code is flawed? \n\n          But the original problem: \n            The first sample: \n                \"7 3\n                 4 3 3 3 2 2 1\" \n                -> output 2.\n\n          How does the code compute: \n                n=7, k=3\n                the integers: [4,3,3,3,2,2,1]\n                l=0, c=1\n                a=4: not 0 -> c=1, l=4.\n                a=3: not 4 -> c=1, l=3.\n                a=3: equals 3 -> c=2, l=3.\n                a=3: equals 3 -> c=3, l=3.\n                a=2: not 3 -> c=1, l=2.\n                a=2: equals 2 -> c=2, l=2.\n                a=1: not 2 -> c=1, l=1.\n\n                Then c=1, condition: c+k=1+3=4<=7 -> false -> output -1.\n\n          But sample output is 2.\n\n          So the code is not for the problem I thought? \n\n          After rechecking: \n            The problem code is \"codeforces_222_A\", but the problem is actually \"A. Shooshuns and Sequence\"? \n\n          Let me search: \n            codeforces 222 A: \n                Problem A: \"Shooshuns and Sequence\"\n\n          The problem: \n                There is a sequence of n integers. \n                In one move: \n                    remove the first element and then append a number to the end: the number is the first element?

by changing them when we move them to the end? \n                And the elements that are already in the last k positions might be changed by moves that happen before they are moved? \n\n          Actually, after we move the first (n-k) elements, the last k elements are the ones that were originally in the middle? \n\n          This is complex.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem is to translate the given Java programs, we will keep the first program as is.\n\n          But the sample: \n                n=7, k=3, array = [4,3,3,3,2,2,1]\n                the consecutive run at the end: \n                    starting from the last: \n                        1 -> distinct? \n                        2, then 2: run=2\n                        3, then 3, then 3: run=3? -> but wait, the array is: [4,3,3,3,2,2,1] \n                    the last element is 1, then 2, then 2 -> not the same.\n\n          The consecutive run at the end of the same number: \n                only the last element: 1 -> c=1.\n\n          Then condition: c+k = 1+3=4<=7 -> output -1.\n\n          But the sample output is 6.\n\n          Therefore, the first program might be for a different problem? \n\n          I found the actual solution for \"222A\": \n                public class codeforces_222_A {\n\n                    public static void main(String[] args) {\n                        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n                        int n = in.nextInt(), k = in.nextInt() - 1, l = 0, c = 0;\n                        int[] a = new int[n];\n                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                            a[i] = in.nextInt();\n                        }\n                        for (int i = k; i < n - 1; i++) {\n                            if (a[i] != a[i+1]) {\n                                System.out.println(-1);\n                                return;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                            if (a[i] != a[k]) {\n                                System.out.println(i+1);\n                                return;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        System.out.println(0);\n                    }\n                }\n\n          This is different.\n\n          Given the confusion, and since the problem says to translate the given Java programs, we will keep the first program as given.\n\n          The first program in the provided set is:\n\n            import java.util.*;\n\n            public class codeforces_222_A {\n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    int n = in.nextInt(), k = in.nextInt(), l = 0, c = 1;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        int a = in.nextInt();\n                        if (a == l) c += 1;\n                        else c = 1;\n                        l = a;\n                    }\n                    if (c + k > n) System.out.println(n - c);\n                    else System.out.println(-1);\n                }\n            }\n\n          We will use that.\n\n          Therefore, the Fortran program is as above.\n\n          Let's hope the chain input is such that the first program's output is an integer that then is processed by the second and third.\n\n          We are not given the context of the chain, so we follow the provided code.\n\n  Final Fortran code:\n\n    Note: We are reading from standard input and writing to standard output.\n\n    We assume the input order: \n        first line: n and k\n        then n lines (or one line?

But we did `freq = 0` before the loop. That is fine.\n\n  We also note that the frequency array covers ASCII 0 to 255, and the string from an integer should only contain digits and possibly '-' -> these are in ASCII.\n\n  This should be the final program."
