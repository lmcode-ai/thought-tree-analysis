  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note the following:\n- The first program (atcoder_ABC109_B) reads an integer N and then N strings. It checks:\n  1. All strings are distinct.\n  2. For each string (from the second onward), the first character must match the last character of the previous string.\n  It outputs \"Yes\" if both conditions hold, otherwise \"No\".\n\n- The second program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and outputs the next character (the character with the next ASCII value). For example, if input is 'a', output is 'b'. But note: it only reads one line. However, the first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program would take that as input.\n\n  Example: \n      Input to second program: \"Yes\" -> then it will output the next character of the first character of \"Yes\", which is 'Y' -> next is 'Z'. \n      But wait: the program does `s.charAt(0) + 1` and then prints as a char. So for 'Y' (ASCII 89) we get 90 which is 'Z'.\n\n- The third program (codeforces_147_A) reads a string and processes it: \n  It ensures that:\n    - Latin letters are kept.\n    - Punctuation marks (.,!?) are kept but without any extra spaces.\n    - Non-letter and non-punctuation (like spaces) are used to separate words: so when we have a letter after a non-letter, we insert a space.\n\n  However, note that the input to the third program is the output of the second: which is a single character? Actually, the second program outputs one character. Then the third program will process that one character.\n\n  Example: if second program outputs 'Z', then the third program will output 'Z' because:\n      - It appends the first character (which is 'Z').\n      - Then for the rest (none) -> so the output is \"Z\".\n\nBut note: the chain of input and output:\n\n  Original chain:\n    Input to first: \n        First integer N, then N strings.\n\n    Output of first: either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes, and with a newline? but note: in Java, println adds a newline).\n\n    Then the second program reads one line. So it reads either \"Yes\" or \"No\". But wait: the first program prints either \"Yes\" or \"No\" and then a newline. The second program uses `readLine()`, so it will read the entire line (without the newline). Then it takes the first character and outputs the next character.\n\n    Then the third program reads one line (the output of the second, which is a single character? but note: the second program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` so no newline? Actually, it does not output a newline. Then the third program uses `readLine()`. How does that work?\n\n    However, the second program outputs one character without a newline. Then when the third program reads, it will read that one character? But note: the second program doesn't flush? Actually, it does not flush explicitly. But the program exits, which flushes. Then the third program reads one line: which is that single character (without a newline).\n\n    So the input to the third program is a string of length 1 (without newline). Then the third program processes and prints the same character? because:\n        - It appends the first character (the only one).\n        - Then the loop runs for i=1 to n-1 (but n=1, so loop doesn't run).\n\n    Then it prints the string and flushes.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain output is the same as the output of the third program: which is the same character as the output of the second.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs \"No\"? Then the second program reads \"No\", takes the first character 'N', then outputs 'O' (because 'N' + 1 = 'O'). Then the third program outputs \"O\".\n\nHowever, the problem says: the entire sequence must be translated into one Fortran program.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We must read the input for the first program: an integer N and then N strings.\n\n2. Then we simulate the first program: \n   - We store the N strings.\n   - We check two conditions:\n        a. All strings are distinct.\n        b. For i from 1 to N-1, the last character of the i-th string equals the first character of the (i+1)-th string.\n\n   If both conditions hold, we set a variable (say, `ans1`) to \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n3. Then we pass this string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") to the second program. But note: the second program only uses the first character of the input. So we take the first character of `ans1` and compute the next character.\n\n   However, note: the second program reads one line. But in our chain, the output of the first program is the entire string (without newline? but actually the first program does println, so it includes a newline). But the second program uses `readLine` which consumes the entire line including the newline? Actually, `readLine` in Java returns the line without the newline. So we have to mimic that.\n\n   But in our Fortran program, we are not actually doing I/O in between. We are processing in memory.\n\n   So after the first block, we have a string `ans1` (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and note that the first program outputs that string and then a newline. However, the second program reads the entire line and then takes the first character (without the newline). So we can simulate: the string that the second program sees is either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without the trailing newline).\n\n   Therefore, we take the first character of `ans1` (which is either 'Y' or 'N') and then compute the next character.\n\n   Example: \n        If `ans1` is \"Yes\", then first char is 'Y'. Then we compute the next char: 'Z' (because ASCII of 'Y' is 89, then 89+1=90 -> 'Z').\n\n        If `ans1` is \"No\", then first char is 'N'. Then next char is 'O' (ASCII 79).\n\n   So we get a single character as the output of the second step.\n\n4. Then we pass this single character (let's call it `c2`) to the third program.\n\n   The third program processes a string. The string is just the one character (so no spaces or punctuation in between). The processing:\n        - The string is of length 1: so we output the first character (which is `c2`).\n        - Then for i=2 to n (which doesn't exist) we do nothing.\n\n   So the output of the third program is the same single character.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program should:\n\n  Step 1: Read N and then N strings.\n  Step 2: Check the conditions and set a string variable `ans1` to either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n  Step 3: Take the first character of `ans1` and compute the next character (by converting to ASCII, adding 1, then converting back to character).\n  Step 4: Output that next character (with a newline? but note the third program does `pw.println(sb)`, so it adds a newline).\n\nBut wait: the third program outputs the string and then a newline. So we must output the character and then a newline.\n\nHowever, note: the original third program does:\n\n    pw.println(sb);   // which appends a newline.\n\nSo our final output should be the character from step 3 and then a newline.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the chain outputs 'Z' and then a newline.\n\nBut let's test:\n\n  Input for first program:\n      3\n      apple\n      letter\n      robot\n\n  Conditions:\n      Distinct? yes.\n      Last of \"apple\" is 'e', first of \"letter\" is 'l' -> not equal -> condition fails -> output \"No\".\n\n  Then second program: takes \"No\", first char 'N', then outputs 'O'.\n\n  Third program: takes \"O\" (without newline) and outputs \"O\" and then a newline.\n\n  So final output: \"O\\n\"\n\nBut note: the first program might output a string with a newline, but we are not outputting that in the middle. We are only outputting at the end.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n  We must read the input for the first program.\n\n  How to represent the strings? We don't know the maximum length of the words, but we can assume a maximum. Let's set a maximum for the number of words (say, 100) and maximum length of each word (say, 100 characters).\n\n  Steps:\n\n    integer :: n, i\n    character(len=100) :: words(100)   ! up to 100 words, each 100 characters\n    logical :: distinct = .true.\n    logical :: chain_ok = .true.\n    character(len=1) :: last_char\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) words(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Check distinctness: for each word, see if it appears again in the following\n    do i = 1, n\n        do j = i+1, n\n            if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n                distinct = .false.\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Check chain: for i from 1 to n-1, the last character of words(i) must equal the first character of words(i+1)\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        if (words(i)(len_trim(words(i)):len_trim(words(i))) /= words(i+1)(1:1)) then\n            chain_ok = .false.\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (distinct .and. chain_ok) then\n        ans1 = \"Yes\"\n    else\n        ans1 = \"No\"\n    end if\n\n    ! Now, the second step: take the first character of ans1 and compute the next character.\n    c1 = ans1(1:1)\n    ! Convert to ASCII, add one, then back to character.\n    c2 = char(ichar(c1) + 1)\n\n    ! Then the third step: the third program would output the same character and then a newline.\n    ! But note: the third program does some processing? However, as we reasoned, for a string of one character that is a letter, it just outputs that character.\n\n    ! Therefore, we output c2 and then a newline.\n\n    write(*,*) c2   ! This will output the character and then a space? Actually, in Fortran, writing a character variable with list-directed I/O (using *) might add a space? We want exactly the character and then a newline.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        write(*,'(a)') c2\n\n    But note: the third program outputs the string without any extra spaces and then a newline. So we do the same.\n\n  However, wait: what if the third program's input is more than one character? In our chain, the second program outputs one character without a newline, so the third program sees one character. But what if the first program outputs \"Yes\" and then the second program outputs 'Z' (without newline) and then the third program outputs that? So the third program outputs exactly that character and then a newline.\n\n  Therefore, we can simply output the character and then a newline.\n\n  But note: the second program does not output a newline? Then the third program reads the entire line? Actually, the entire line is just that one character. Then the third program outputs the same character and then a newline.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      write(*, '(a)') c2   ! This will output the character and then a newline.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: what if the first program outputs \"No\" and then the second program outputs 'O'? Then the third program outputs 'O' and a newline.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs \"Yes\", which is 3 letters? The second program only uses the first letter. So we only take the first letter of the string `ans1`.\n\nBut note: the second program does `s.charAt(0)`, which is the first character of the entire line (without the newline). So we are correct.\n\nHowever, what if the first program outputs a string with spaces? It doesn't: it's either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo we can write the program accordingly.\n\nBut note: the first program might output \"Yes\" or \"No\", but the second program only uses the first character. So even if the string is \"Yes\", we only use 'Y'. Similarly for \"No\", we use 'N'.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  We assume the input for the first program: first integer n, then n words.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Read n\n    Read n words\n\n    Check distinctness: loop over i and j.\n\n    Check chain condition: loop over i from 1 to n-1.\n\n    Set ans1 to \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n    c1 = first character of ans1\n    c2 = next character (by ichar+1)\n\n    Output c2 and a newline.\n\nBut note: the distinctness check: the Java program uses a HashMap to store the words and then checks if the current word is already in the past words. We can do the same with an array and a double loop.\n\nAlso note: the Java program breaks at the first duplicate or chain break. We can break early too.\n\nLet's optimize the loops:\n\n  distinct = .true.\n  do i = 1, n\n      do j = i+1, n\n          if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n              distinct = .false.\n              exit  ! but note: the Java program breaks out of the inner loop? Actually, it breaks the outer loop too? \n                    ! The Java program breaks the outer loop when it finds a duplicate? Actually, it breaks the entire loop when it finds one duplicate OR one chain break. But note: it does both checks in the same loop.\n\n  How the Java program works:\n\n      It iterates i from 0 to N-1:\n        - Check if the current word is already in the `past` (which is a HashMap of the previous words). So if it's found, set ans=false and break.\n        - Then if i != 0, check if the first character of the current word is equal to `next` (which is the last character of the previous word). If not, set ans=false and break.\n\n      So we must break at the first failure.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      logical :: valid = .true.\n      character(len=100) :: current\n      character(len=1) :: last_char\n\n      ! Check distinctness: we can do as we go and also the chain condition in the same loop.\n\n      ! First word: no chain condition to check.\n\n      ! We'll store the words we've seen in an array? But we already have the array. We can check for duplicates in the previous words? \n\n      Actually, the Java program uses a HashMap `past` that is built as we go. We can do:\n\n          valid = .true.\n          ! For the first word: \n          !   Check duplicate? only if it appears in the past (which is empty) -> no duplicate.\n          !   Then set last_char to the last character of the first word.\n\n          Then for the second word and beyond:\n             - Check if the current word is in the set of words from 1 to i-1 -> duplicate? if yes, break.\n             - Check if the first character of the current word equals the last_char of the previous word.\n\n      How to check duplicate for the current word in the previous words? We can do:\n\n          do j = 1, i-1\n              if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n                  valid = .false.\n                  exit\n              end if\n          end do\n\n      Then if valid is false, break.\n\n      Then check the chain condition (if i>=2) and set last_char.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      valid = .true.\n      ! For i=1, we don't check duplicate? Actually, the first word: the past is empty -> so no duplicate. Then we set last_char = last character of word1.\n\n      Then for i=2 to n:\n          ! Check duplicate: see if words(i) is in words(1:i-1)\n          do j = 1, i-1\n              if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n                  valid = .false.\n                  exit\n              end if\n          end do\n          if (.not. valid) exit\n\n          ! Check chain condition: last_char (from previous word) must equal the first character of words(i)\n          if (last_char /= words(i)(1:1)) then\n              valid = .false.\n              exit\n          end if\n\n          ! Then set last_char to the last character of words(i)\n\n      But note: the Java program sets the last_char even if it breaks? Actually, if it breaks, it doesn't set? But it doesn't matter because we break.\n\n      Also, the Java program sets the last_char for the current word even if it is the first word? Yes.\n\n  So:\n\n      last_char = words(1)(len_trim(words(1)):len_trim(words(1)))\n      valid = .true.\n      do i = 2, n\n          ! Check duplicate: words(i) in words(1:i-1)\n          do j = 1, i-1\n              if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n                  valid = .false.\n                  exit\n              end if\n          end do\n          if (.not. valid) exit\n\n          ! Check chain condition\n          if (last_char /= words(i)(1:1)) then\n              valid = .false.\n              exit\n          end if\n\n          last_char = words(i)(len_trim(words(i)):len_trim(words(i)))\n      end do\n\n  Then if valid is true, then ans1 = \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nBut note: the duplicate check in the Java program is done for every word (including the first) but the first word is not in the past set at the time of check (so it passes). Then the first word is added to the past. Our loop for i=2..n does not check the first word for duplicate? Actually, the first word is stored in words(1). Then when we get the second word, we check if it equals the first word. Then the third word, we check if it equals the first or the second, etc. So we are checking duplicates correctly.\n\n  However, what if the first word is duplicated? Then the duplicate will be caught when we read the second word? But what if the first word is duplicated in the first word? That cannot happen. Actually, the first word is only one. The duplicate can only occur when a later word equals an earlier word.\n\n  But note: the Java program checks for the current word in the set of words that have been processed (so words 0 to i-1). We are doing the same.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, j, length\n          character(len=100) :: words(100)   ! assuming at most 100 words\n          character(len=1) :: last_char, c1, c2\n          logical :: valid\n          character(len=3) :: ans1   ! \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n          ! Read n\n          read(*,*) n\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) words(i)\n          end do\n\n          valid = .true.\n          !

Trim the word to remove trailing spaces? because the input may have trailing spaces? \n              ! Actually, the read with * will remove trailing spaces? Not exactly: the read with * reads a word without spaces. But the problem says: the input words are strings. They might contain spaces? \n              ! The Java program uses `sc.next()` which reads tokens (without spaces). So we assume each word is a token without spaces.\n\n              ! How to get the last character? we use the length of the string as stored? But Fortran stores with trailing spaces. We need the actual string without trailing spaces.\n\n              ! We can use `trim` to remove trailing spaces, then take the last character.\n              length = len_trim(words(1))\n              if (length == 0) then\n                  valid = .false.   ! empty word? but the problem says N words, and each word is given. We assume non-empty.\n              else\n                  last_char = words(1)(length:length)\n              end if\n\n              ! Check for duplicate in the first word? none because only one.\n\n          end if\n\n          ! Now, if n==0, then we skip the loop? but the Java program: \n          !   It would run the loop for i=0 to N-1, but if N=0, then the loop runs 0 times -> sets ans to true -> outputs \"Yes\".\n\n          ! We'll handle n=0 separately? but the problem says at least one word? not specified. Let's be safe.\n\n          if (n == 0) then\n              valid = .true.\n          else\n              ! We start from the second word to the last.\n              do i = 2, n\n                  !

Update last_char to the last character of words(i)\n                  length = len_trim(words(i))\n                  last_char = words(i)(length:length)\n              end do\n          end if\n\n          if (valid) then\n              ans1 = \"Yes\"\n          else\n              ans1 = \"No\"\n          end if\n\n          ! Second step: take the first character of ans1\n          c1 = ans1(1:1)\n          c2 = char(ichar(c1) + 1)\n\n          ! Third step: output the character and a newline\n          write(*, '(a)') c2\n\n      end program\n\nBut note: the first program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then the second program reads the entire line. But in our simulation, we have the string `ans1` which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then we take the first character. However, what if `ans1` is \"Yes\", then the entire string is 3 characters? But the second program only takes the first. So we are correct.\n\nAlso, note: the first program does not output anything else. We are not outputting the entire `ans1` in the middle, only using it to compute `c1`.\n\nBut what about the newline? The second program in the chain would read the entire line (without the newline). So the string it gets is \"Yes\" (without the newline) or \"No\". Then it takes the first character. We are taking the first character of the string \"Yes\" (which is 'Y') and that matches.\n\nTherefore, the program is as above.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious about the trimming: when comparing words for duplicate, we should compare without trailing spaces? because the read with * will remove the trailing spaces? Actually, no: the read with * will read the next token (without any spaces). So the words are stored without leading or trailing spaces? \n\n  Example: if the input word is \"abc  \", then Fortran read with * will store \"abc\" (without the trailing spaces). So we can use `trim` to be safe? Actually, the variable `words(i)` is read as a token without spaces. So we don't have trailing spaces. Therefore, we can compare without trimming? \n\n  But note: the read(*,*) words(i) will read the next token (so without spaces). So the words are stored without trailing spaces. Therefore, the length of the string is exactly the length of the token. And we can compare with `words(i) == words(j)`.\n\n  However, what if the word has leading spaces? The read(*,*) will remove leading spaces too.\n\n  So we can assume that the words are stored without leading or trailing spaces.\n\n  Then, to get the last character of a word, we can do:\n\n        length = len_trim(words(i))   ! actually, the whole string is the token, so no trailing spaces. But the variable is declared as 100 characters. So we need to get the actual length.\n\n        last_char = words(i)(length:length)\n\n  Similarly, the first character is words(i)(1:1).\n\n  And for duplicate check: we can simply do:\n\n        if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n  Because they are stored without spaces and of the same length? But if they are the same token, then the entire string is the same.\n\n  But note: if two tokens are the same, then the strings are the same. So we are safe.\n\n  Also, the chain condition: the last character of the previous word must equal the first character of the current word. We get the last character of the previous word by the above method.\n\n  Therefore, we can remove the trims in the duplicate check? Actually, we don't need trim because the words are stored without trailing spaces. But note: if the word is exactly 100 characters, then there are no trailing spaces? Actually, if the word is 100 characters, then it fills the entire variable. Then len_trim would return 100? because there are no trailing spaces? \n\n  However, if the word is shorter than 100, then the rest are spaces. So we must use `len_trim` to get the actual length.\n\n  So the duplicate check: we compare the entire 100-character string? which might have trailing spaces? But the read(*,*) stores the token without trailing spaces? Actually, no: the read(*,*) will put the token in the variable and then pad with spaces to the full length? \n\n  Example: if we have:\n\n        character(len=100) :: s\n        read(*,*) s   ! and input is \"abc\"\n\n        Then s is \"abc\" followed by 97 spaces.\n\n  Then when we do:\n\n        if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n  It compares the entire 100 characters. But if one word is \"abc\" and the other is \"abc\", then they are both \"abc\" followed by 97 spaces -> same.\n\n  But if one word is \"abc\" and the other is \"abc \", then they are the same? because Fortran pads with spaces. Actually, the read(*,*) will read \"abc\" and store as \"abc\" and then spaces. So both are stored the same.\n\n  Therefore, we can compare without trimming? \n\n  However, what if the word has leading spaces? The read(*,*) will skip leading spaces. So they are stored without leading spaces.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  But note: the chain condition: we compare the last character of the previous word. We must take the non-space last character. But we are using `len_trim` to get the last non-space character. So that's correct.\n\n  Therefore, the program:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, j, length\n          character(len=100) :: words(100)   ! up to 100 words, each up to 100 characters\n          character(len=1) :: last_char, c1, c2\n          logical :: valid\n          character(len=3) :: ans1   ! \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n          read(*,*) n\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) words(i)\n          end do\n\n          !

Second step: take the first character of ans1\n          c1 = ans1(1:1)\n          c2 = char(ichar(c1) + 1)\n\n          ! Third step: output the character and a newline\n          write(*, '(a)') c2\n\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: what if n=1? Then the loop for i=2 to n doesn't run. So we set valid to true (if the first word is non-empty) and then set ans1 to \"Yes\".\n\n  Then we output the next character of 'Y' -> 'Z'. So output 'Z'.\n\n  Example: input \n        1\n        a\n    -> valid: true -> ans1=\"Yes\", then output 'Z'\n\n  But the original chain: \n        First program: outputs \"Yes\" (with newline)\n        Second program: reads \"Yes\", then outputs 'Y'+1 -> 'Z' (without newline)\n        Third program: reads \"Z\" (without newline) and outputs \"Z\" and then a newline.\n\n  So our output is 'Z' and a newline.\n\n  Therefore, it matches.\n\n  Another example: \n        Input:\n            2\n            apple\n            error\n\n        Conditions: \n            Distinct? yes.\n            Last of \"apple\" is 'e', first of \"error\" is 'e' -> valid.\n\n        Then ans1=\"Yes\", then output 'Z'.\n\n  But wait: what if the first word is \"Yes\"? Then we output 'Z'? but the chain would output 'Z'? Yes.\n\n  But what if the first program outputs \"No\", then the output is 'O'.\n\n  However, what if the first word is \"No\"? Then the chain:\n\n        First program: \n            words: \"No\" (one word) -> valid: true -> outputs \"Yes\"? no: wait, n=1 -> valid=true -> \"Yes\".\n\n        But if the input is:\n\n            1\n            No\n\n        Then the first program: \n            distinct: yes (only one word).\n            chain condition: none (only one word) -> valid -> output \"Yes\".\n\n        Then the second program: outputs 'Z'.\n\n        Therefore, the word \"No\" in the input does not cause the first program to output \"No\". Only if the conditions fail.\n\n  So our program is correct.\n\n  However, note: the first program in Java breaks the loop as soon as it finds a duplicate or chain break. We break similarly.\n\n  We'll run the example from the problem: \n        3\n        apple\n        letter\n        robot\n\n        Conditions: \n            Distinct: yes.\n            Chain: \n                apple -> last char 'e'\n                letter -> first char 'l' -> fails.\n\n        So valid becomes false at i=2.\n\n        Then ans1=\"No\", then output 'O'.\n\n  Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n  But note: what if there is an empty word? We check for length==0 and set valid to false.\n\n  We assume the input words are non-empty? The problem doesn't say, but the Java program would crash if a word is empty? because `map.get(i).substring(0,1)` would throw an exception if the word is empty. So we assume non-empty words.\n\n  If we get an empty word, we set valid to false and break.\n\n  Therefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, j, length\n          character(len=100) :: words(100)   ! maximum 100 words, each 100 characters\n          character(len=1) :: last_char, c1, c2\n          logical :: valid\n          character(len=3) :: ans1\n\n          !

Handle n=0 separately: valid = true\n          if (n == 0) then\n              valid = .true.\n          else\n              ! Process the first word\n              length = len_trim(words(1))\n              if (length == 0) then\n                  valid = .false.\n              else\n                  last_char = words(1)(length:length)\n                  valid = .true.\n              end if\n\n              ! Process the rest of the words if there are more and if still valid\n              if (valid .and. n > 1) then\n                  do i = 2, n\n                      ! Check for duplicates in the previous words\n                      do j = 1, i-1\n                          if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n                              valid = .false.\n                              exit\n                          end if\n                      end do\n                      if (.not. valid) exit   ! break the outer loop\n\n                      ! Check the chain condition: the first character of the current word must match last_char\n                      if (words(i)(1:1) /= last_char) then\n                          valid = .false.\n                          exit\n                      end if\n\n                      ! Update last_char to the last character of the current word\n                      length = len_trim(words(i))\n                      if (length == 0) then\n                          valid = .false.\n                          exit\n                      end if\n                      last_char = words(i)(length:length)\n                  end do\n              end if\n          end if\n\n          if (valid) then\n              ans1 = \"Yes\"\n          else\n              ans1 = \"No\"\n          end if\n\n          c1 = ans1(1:1)\n          c2 = char(ichar(c1) + 1)\n          write(*, '(a)') c2\n\n      end program combined"
