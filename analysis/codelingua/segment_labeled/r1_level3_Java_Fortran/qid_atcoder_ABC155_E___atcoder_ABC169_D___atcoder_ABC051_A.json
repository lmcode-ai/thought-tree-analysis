Specifically, for each prime factor `i` with exponent `count`, it subtracts 1, then 2, then 3, etc., until the remaining exponent is non-negative, and counts the number of subtractions (which is the number of operations for that prime).\n   - Then, if after factorization there is a prime left (i.e., `n>1`), it adds one more operation.\n   - Outputs the total number of operations.\n\n3. **File 3 (atcoder_ABC051_A)**:\n   - Reads a string that contains commas and replaces each comma with a space.\n   - Outputs the modified string.\n\nHowever, note the sequence: \n   Input -> File1 -> Output1 (which becomes input to File2) -> File2 -> Output2 (which becomes input to File3) -> File3 -> Output3.\n\nBut observe the inputs and outputs:\n   - File1: input is a string of digits (e.g., \"12345\"), output is an integer (e.g., 5).\n   - File2: input is a long integer (e.g., 5), output is an integer (e.g., 1).\n   - File3: input is a string (which in the chain would be the output of File2, so an integer as a string) and it replaces commas (but the input string from File2 doesn't have commas) so it just outputs the same integer as a string but without any commas? Actually, the example input for File3 is something like \"1,000,000\" and it becomes \"1 000 000\". However, the output of File2 is a single integer without commas. So in the chain, the input to File3 is a string of digits (without commas). Therefore, the replacement in File3 would have no effect.\n\nBut note: the chain must be preserved. The output of File1 (an integer) is passed as a string to File2? Actually, in the Java programs, each reads from standard input and writes to standard output. So when chaining, we use the text representation.\n\nHowever, the challenge is to combine them without intermediate I/O. We must design the data flow:\n\n   Step 1: The first program reads a string (from the user) and produces an integer (which we'll call `bills`). But then this integer must be passed to the second program as a long integer? Actually, the second program expects a long integer. But the output of the first is an integer, which is within the range of a long.\n\n   Step 2: The second program takes the long integer (which is the `bills` from the first) and produces an integer (the answer). Then this integer is passed to the third program.\n\n   Step 3: The third program takes a string. But note: the output of the second program is an integer (printed without any commas). So the third program will read a string that is just the integer. It then replaces commas in that string by spaces. Since there are no commas, the output will be the same integer as a string.\n\nHowever, the third program in the original code reads a whole line and replaces commas by spaces. In the chain, the input to the third program is a single integer on one line. So the replacement will do nothing.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first is the integer as a string (without commas) and the second program reads that string and converts it to a long. Similarly, the output of the second is an integer as a string (without commas) and the third program reads that string and replaces commas (if any) by spaces. Since there are no commas, the third program outputs the same integer string.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input: a string of digits (e.g., \"12345\")\n   Output1: an integer (say 5) -> then passed as the string \"5\" to the second program.\n   The second program: reads \"5\", converts to long 5, then processes and outputs an integer (say 1) -> the string \"1\" to the third.\n   The third program: reads \"1\", replaces commas (none) and outputs \"1\".\n\nBut note: the first program might output a string without a newline? Actually, `System.out.println` prints with a newline. The second program uses `scanner.nextLong()` which ignores leading whitespace and reads the next token. Similarly, the third program reads a whole line.\n\nIn Fortran, we have to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O. Therefore:\n\n   We will design:\n     1. Read the initial string (from standard input) for the first program.\n     2. Process the first program to get an integer `bills`.\n     3. Use `bills` as the input for the second program (which expects a long integer, but Fortran integers can be large enough? We have to check the constraints).\n     4. Process the second program to get an integer `answer2`.\n     5. Then, we want to output the string representation of `answer2` but without any commas? Actually, the third program just replaces commas by spaces. Since we don't have commas, we can just output the integer as a string.\n\nBut note: the third program in the original code reads a line and replaces commas. In the chain, the input to the third program is the string representation of `answer2` (without commas). So the third program would output the same string. Therefore, we can skip the replacement step because there are no commas? However, we must exactly mimic the behavior.\n\nBut observe: the third program was designed to handle inputs that have commas. In our chain, the input to the third program (which is the output of the second) is a string of digits without commas. Therefore, the third program will output the same string of digits. So we can just output the integer `answer2` as a string? However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if we pass a string without commas, the third program outputs the same. Therefore, we can just output the integer.\n\nHowever, the third program also reads a whole line. What if the output of the second program had multiple lines? It doesn't: the second program outputs a single integer and then a newline. The third program then reads one line (the integer) and replaces commas. Then it outputs that line.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can:\n\n   - Read the initial string (the one that the first Java program reads) from standard input.\n   - Process the first program to get an integer `bills`.\n   - Process the second program using `bills` as the input (so we set `n = bills` and then factorize and compute the answer for the second program).\n   - Then, we have the integer result from the second program, which we then output (as a string without any commas and without any extra spaces) and that's the final output.\n\nBut note: the third program doesn't change the string if there are no commas. So we can skip the replacement? Actually, we must not skip: if the integer from the second program had commas, we would have to replace. But it doesn't. However, to be safe, we can output the integer as a string without any formatting (so no commas).\n\nBut the original third program would output the same as the input string if there are no commas. So we can just output the integer from the second program? Yes.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n   Step 1: Read a string (the initial number string).\n   Step 2: Process as in the first Java program to get `bills`.\n   Step 3: Use `bills` as `n` for the second program and compute the answer (which we call `answer2`).\n   Step 4: Print `answer2` (as an integer, which Fortran will output without commas).\n\nBut note: the third program in Java outputs the same string as it got? Actually, it outputs the same string but with commas replaced by spaces. Since the input to the third program is a string of digits without commas, the output is the same. Therefore, we can just output `answer2`.\n\nHowever, we must note: the third program does not convert the integer to a string? It reads a string and then replaces commas. So the output of the third program is the same as the input string. Therefore, we can skip the explicit replacement because the input to the third program (which is the output of the second) is a string without commas.\n\nBut what if the integer from the second program is very large and we want to output it as a string without commas? Fortran's `write` statement for integers does not include commas. So we are safe.\n\nConstraints from the original Java programs:\n\n   - The first program: the input string can be up to 10^6 digits? Actually, the problem atcoder_ABC155_E constraints: the number has up to 10^6 digits. But we cannot store an array of 10^6 integers in Fortran? Actually, we can if we use dynamic allocation. But note: the problem says the entire sequence must be translated.\n\n   However, the second program: the input `n` is the `bills` from the first program. How big can `bills` be? The first program processes a number with up to 10^6 digits. The worst-case scenario for `bills` is that we use about 5 * 10^5 bills? Actually, the algorithm: for each digit, we add at most 10. So worst-case, `bills` could be up to 10^7? But note: the algorithm in the first program does a carry-over. Actually, the number of bills is linear in the number of digits. Since the number of digits is up to 10^6, the `bills` could be up to 10^6 * 10? But worst-case, each digit might require 10 bills? Actually, worst-case: the digit is 9 -> then we add 10-9=1 bill and carry over. Then the next digit becomes 1 (from the carry) plus the original digit. But worst-case, the entire number is 9's? Then we have to carry over all the way. The total bills would be about the number of digits? Actually, each digit 9 becomes 1 bill and a carry to the next. The last carry adds one more bill? So total bills = number of digits + 1? So at most 10^6+1.\n\n   Therefore, the second program will get an integer `n` that is at most 10^6+1 (which is 1000001). Then the second program factorizes this integer? 1000001 is a prime? Actually, 1000001 = 101 * 9901. So the factorization is feasible.\n\n   So we can safely use integer(kind=8) for `bills` and the second program.\n\nPlan for Fortran:\n\n   We'll use:\n     - A character array to read the initial string (we'll assume a maximum length, but the problem says up to 10^6 digits? We must be cautious. However, Fortran may have limitations on the length of a string. We'll use a large enough length and dynamic allocation if possible? But standard Fortran doesn't have dynamic allocation for character variables in the same way. Alternatively, we can read the string and then get its length. But we can use a fixed maximum length? The problem says the first program reads a string that can be up to 10^6 characters. So we must allocate a string of 1000000 characters? But Fortran can handle that? Yes, but we have to be careful.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read the initial string from standard input. We assume it is one line.\n\n   2. Reverse the string to get the digits from least significant to most significant? The Java program does:\n          for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n              digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n          }\n\n      So we'll create an integer array `digits` of length (len+1) (with len being the length of the string) and store the digits in reverse order.\n\n   3. Process the digits as in the first program to compute `bills`.\n\n   4. Then, set `n = bills` (for the second program).\n\n   5. Factorize `n`? We need to factorize an integer up to 10^6. We can do trial division up to sqrt(n) (which is about 1000).\n\n   6. For each prime factor, we count the exponent and then for each exponent we subtract consecutive integers (starting at 1) until we cannot subtract anymore, and count the number of subtractions (which is the number of operations).\n\n   7. Then, if after factorization, `n>1`, we add one more operation.\n\n   8. Then, we output this final integer (the total operations).\n\n   Note: The third program is effectively a no-op because the string representation of the integer has no commas, so we just output the integer.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n   - Reads a string (the initial number)\n   - Processes the first program to get `bills`\n   - Processes the second program with `n = bills` to get `answer2`\n   - Writes `answer2` to standard output.\n\nBut note: the first program might have a carry beyond the last digit? The digits array has length (number.length()+1). The Java program indexes from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). So we must allocate an array of size len+1, and set the last element (for the carry) to 0 initially? Then during processing, we might set the next digit.\n\nImplementation details for the first program in Fortran:\n\n   Let `str` be the input string, and `len_str = LEN_TRIM(str)`? Actually, we read the entire line. We can use:\n\n        character(1000000) :: str   ! but 1000000 might be too long? We can use allocatable?\n        integer :: len_str\n\n        read(*, '(a)') str\n        len_str = len_trim(str)\n\n   But note: the input string might have leading zeros? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume it's a positive integer.\n\n   Then, we create an integer array `digits` of size 0:len_str (or 1:len_str+1). We'll index from 1 to len_str for the original string, but we want the first digit in the array (index 1) to be the least significant.\n\n        do i = 1, len_str\n            digits(i) = ICHAR(str(len_str-i+1:len_str-i+1)) - ICHAR('0')\n        end do\n        digits(len_str+1) = 0   ! for the carry beyond the last digit\n\n   Then we process from i=1 to len_str (but note the Java program goes to `number.length()` which is `len_str` and then also one more at `i = len_str+1`? Actually, the loop in Java is for `i` from 0 to `number.length()` (inclusive). The array `digits` is of length `number.length()+1` and the last element (at index `number.length()`) is set to 0 initially? Actually, the last element is beyond the string. The Java code:\n\n        digits = new int[number.length() + 1];   // all zeros initially.\n\n   So we can set our `digits` array of size 1 to len_str+1, and initialize to 0? Actually, we set the first `len_str` from the string and the last one (index len_str+1) to 0.\n\n   Then, the loop: for i from 1 to len_str+1? But note: the Java loop runs from i=0 to i<=number.length() (i.e., i from 0 to number.length() inclusive). That is, the loop runs for (number.length()+1) times. The last index of the array is number.length() (0-indexed) so the array has indices 0..number.length(). But we allocated an array of size number.length()+1.\n\n   In our Fortran, we'll let the array be indexed from 1 to len_str+1. Then we process i from 1 to len_str+1.\n\n   Steps for the first program:\n\n        bills = 0\n        do i = 1, len_str+1\n            if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                digits(i) = 0\n            end if\n\n            if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                bills = bills + digits(i)\n            else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                if (i < len_str+1) then   ! because digits(i+1) might be out of bounds? But we allocated up to len_str+1, and we are at i, then i+1 is at len_str+2? So we allocated only to len_str+1. Therefore, we must extend the array to len_str+2? Or note the Java code: the array is of length len_str+1, so the last valid index is len_str (0-indexed) -> in our 1-indexed: index len_str+1. Then when i = len_str+1, we cannot access i+1? Actually, the Java code has an array of length len_str+1, which means indices 0..len_str (so the last index is len_str). Then when i = len_str (the last index) then digits[i+1] would be beyond the array? But the Java code initializes the array of length len_str+1, so the last element is at index len_str. Then the loop goes to i=len_str (which is the last element) and then we set digits[i+1] -> which is beyond? That would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException? \n\n   Let me check the Java code:\n\n        digits = new int[number.length() + 1];   // indices 0 to number.length()\n        ... then in the loop for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive) -> that is, i = number.length() is the last index? Then when i = number.length(), we do:\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {   // then set digits[i+1]++ -> but that would be index number.length()+1 -> which is beyond the array.\n\n   This is a bug? Or note: the array is initialized to zeros and the last element (at index number.length()) is 0? But if the last digit (the most significant) becomes 10, then we try to set the next one? But the array only has index up to number.length(). \n\n   However, the problem says the input string is nonnegative and the processing might require a carry beyond the most significant digit. Therefore, the array must be of length number.length()+2? \n\n   Actually, the original problem at ABC155_E: the solution uses an array of length (n+1) and then the loop runs for i=0 to n (where n = number.length()). But then the array has n+1 elements, so the last element is at index n. Then when i=n, we access digits[i+1] -> index n+1 -> which is out of bounds.\n\n   Looking at the original problem and solution: it is known that the array must be of length n+2? Actually, the solution I see in the contest uses:\n\n        int[] s = new int[n+1];\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            s[i] = S.charAt(n-1-i) - '0';\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n            // ... and then they use s[i+1] in the carry\n        }\n\n   But then the array s is of length n+1, so the valid indices are 0..n. Then when i=n, we do s[i+1] -> index n+1 -> out of bounds.\n\n   Correction: the solution in the problem might use an array of length n+2? Actually, in the code we have:\n\n        String number = sc.next();\n        int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\n   That's an array of length (number.length()+1). Then the loop runs for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). And inside, we have:\n\n        if (digits[i] == 10) {\n            digits[i+1]++;\n            digits[i] = 0;\n        }\n\n   And then we access digits[i+1]. For i = number.length(), we are accessing digits[number.length()+1] -> which is beyond the array (the array only goes to index number.length()).\n\n   This is an error. However, note that the array is of size number.length()+1, which in Java means indices 0 to number.length() (so the last index is number.length()). Then i+1 for i=number.length() would be number.length()+1 -> which is out of bounds.\n\n   How to fix? We should allocate an array of size number.length()+2? Then set the last two to zero.\n\n   But the original code might have run without error because the last digit might not be 10? Actually, the initial digits are set only for indices 0 to number.length()-1, and then the last two (index number.length() and number.length()+1) are 0? But we allocated only up to number.length(). So it's an error.\n\n   We must fix: we allocate an array of size (number.length()+2) and set the extra element to 0.\n\n   In our Fortran, we'll allocate an array of size 1 to len_str+2 (so indices 1 to len_str+2). Then we set:\n\n        digits(1:len_str) = the reversed digits of the string\n        digits(len_str+1:len_str+2) = 0\n\n   Then we process i from 1 to len_str+1 (which corresponds to the loop from 0 to number.length() in Java).\n\n   Now, the condition for 5:\n\n        else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n            if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then   ! note: we have allocated up to len_str+2, so i+1 is within bounds for i up to len_str+1? Actually, when i = len_str+1, then digits(i+1) is at index len_str+2, which we have set to 0 -> so 0>=5 is false.\n            ... so we just add 5.\n\n   So the Fortran code for the first program:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        character(1000000) :: str  ! maximum length 1000000\n        integer :: len_str, i, bills, temp\n        integer, allocatable :: digits(:)\n        integer :: n, answer2, j, count, k, factor\n        integer*8 :: n8   ! we don't need int64 because the bills is at most 10^6+1, which is within 4-byte integer? But to be safe, we use 8-byte for the second program? The second program uses long.\n\n        ! Read the string\n        read(*, '(a)') str\n        len_str = len_trim(str)\n\n        ! Allocate digits array: from 1 to len_str+2, set to 0\n        allocate(digits(len_str+2))\n        digits = 0\n\n        ! Convert the string to reversed digits\n        do i = 1, len_str\n            ! str: the first character is the most significant? We want the last character of str to be the least significant -> so we reverse.\n            digits(i) = ichar(str(len_str-i+1:len_str-i+1)) - ichar('0')\n        end do\n\n        bills = 0\n        do i = 1, len_str+1\n            if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                digits(i) = 0\n            end if\n\n            if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                bills = bills + digits(i)\n            else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                if (i < len_str+1) then   ! because at i = len_str+1, digits(i+1) is the last allocated (index len_str+2) which is 0 -> but we don't want to check if i+1 is beyond? Actually, we allocated up to len_str+2, so we can check without bound error. But the condition in Java: if (digits[i+1] >= 5). We can do:\n                    if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n                bills = bills + 5\n            else\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Now bills is the result from the first program.\n\n        ! Second program: input n = bills\n        n = bills   ! Note: bills is an integer, and the second program uses a long. But our bills is within 4-byte integer? So we can use integer for n.\n\n        answer2 = 0\n        ! Factorize n\n        factor = 2\n        ! We'll go up to sqrt(n)\n        do while (factor * factor <= n)\n            count = 0\n            do while (mod(n, factor) == 0)\n                n = n / factor\n                count = count + 1\n            end do\n            j = 1\n            do while (count - j >= 0)\n                count = count - j\n                j = j + 1\n                answer2 = answer2 + 1\n            end do\n            factor = factor + 1\n        end do\n        if (n > 1) then\n            answer2 = answer2 + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Now, output the answer2 (which is the result of the second program, and then the third program would output the same string without commas, so we just output the integer)\n        write(*,*) answer2\n\n        deallocate(digits)\n        end program combined\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `long n` but the value of `bills` is at most 10^6+1, so we can use a 4-byte integer. However, to be safe, we can use 8-byte integers for the second program? But the factorization loop: factor goes up to sqrt(n) which is about 1000. So it's safe.\n\nAlso, note: the second program uses:\n\n            for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt; i++)\n\n   But we are using a while loop with factor starting at 2 and incrementing. This is equivalent.\n\n   However, note: the second program does not skip non-prime factors? Actually, by the time we get to a composite factor, the number has already been divided by its prime factors. So it's safe.\n\n   Also, the inner loop for subtracting consecutive integers: we use a while loop that subtracts j (starting at 1) and increments j until we can't subtract anymore.\n\n   Finally, we output `answer2`.\n\n   But note: the third program would output the same as the second program's output? So we just output `answer2` as an integer.\n\n   However, the original third program outputs the string without any extra spaces? The Fortran `write(*,*)` adds a space at the beginning? We can use `write(*,'(i0)')` to output without any extra spaces.\n\n   So the last write statement:\n\n        write(*, '(i0)') answer2\n\n   This will output the integer without any leading/trailing spaces and without commas.\n\n   Therefore, the complete Fortran code:\n\n   (Note: We assume the input string is without spaces and only digits. We also assume the string is at most 1000000 characters.)\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the array `digits` has size len_str+2. If the input string is 1000000 characters, then we are allocating 1000002 integers -> which is about 4*1000002 = 4e6 bytes -> 4MB, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the Java program for the first step uses an array of integers for each digit. We do the same.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        implicit none\n        character(1000000) :: str   ! fixed length 1000000, but we read the actual string and then use len_trim to get the length? However, if the string is shorter, we have trailing blanks? We read with a format that reads the entire line? But we use '(a)' which will read the entire line and store without trailing blanks? Actually, the `read` with '(a)' will store the entire line and if the variable is longer, it will be padded with spaces. Then `len_trim` returns the length without trailing spaces.\n\n   But note: the input string might have leading zeros? The problem does not specify, but we assume it's a positive integer without any extra characters.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Let's write the Fortran program."
