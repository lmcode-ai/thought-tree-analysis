Then if we have two '2's: \n            Initially: \"22\"\n            After forward: \n                i=1: compare s1[0]='2' and s1[1]='2' -> equal -> flip s1[1] to '1' -> becomes \"21\", count=1. Then next: compare '2' and '1' -> not equal -> no flip. Similarly, backward pass: \n            Start from the end: \n                i = len-1: compare s1[len-1] and s1[len-2]: \n                    if equal, then flip the left one: \n                        if the left one is '1' -> flip to '0'; else to '1'. For \"22\": \n                flip the left one: becomes \"12\", count=1. Then T = min(1,1)=1. So we can run the same logic on a decimal digit string? It will work? But note: the goal is to make the string alternating? But after flipping, the string might still have non-binary digits? However, the problem does not specify the domain. We are just translating the chain. So we will implement the same flipping rules for any character: When flipping, we set:\n            if the current char is '1', then set to '0'; else set to '1'. This is done regardless of the original value?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC171_B) reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers.\n    It sorts the array and sums the first k smallest numbers, then outputs the sum.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string (which will be the output of the first program, i.e., an integer) \n    but note: the first program outputs an integer, and the second program expects a string of '0's and '1's? \n    Actually, the chain is broken: the first program outputs an integer, the second expects a string of digits (like \"0101\").\n    However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n    But note the input to the second program is a string of '0' and '1'? How can the integer output of the first program become the string of the second?\n    We must reconsider: the problem states that the entire sequence is executed, meaning the output of the first is the input of the second.\n\n    However, the second program expects a string of characters '0' and '1' (like \"0011\"). The first program outputs an integer (say 123). \n    We must convert that integer to a string? But the second program is designed for a string of alternating 0s and 1s? \n\n    This indicates that the programs are not intended to be chained arbitrarily. We must follow the specification: \n    \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n    How the chain works?\n      Program1: reads n, k and an array of n integers -> outputs an integer (sum of first k smallest)\n      Program2: reads a string (which in the chain will be the string representation of that integer) -> but note the second program expects a string of 0/1? \n      However, the example input for program2 might be \"000\" or \"101\", but the output of program1 is a decimal integer.\n\n    This mismatch suggests that the chain as described might be artificial? \n\n    Let me look at the third program: \n      Program3: reads a string (which is the output of program2, which is the integer from program1 after being transformed by program2?).\n\n    Actually, program2 does: \n        It takes a string of 0s and 1s and counts the minimum changes to make it alternating. Then outputs an integer (the count).\n\n    Then program3: \n        It takes a string (which is the output of program2, an integer) and then does a DP on the string of digits? \n\n    But note: the output of program2 is an integer (say 2) and then program3 expects a string? That string would be \"2\", which is a single digit? \n\n    However, the program3 is designed for a string that might contain '?' and digits, and it does modulo 13. \n\n    So the chain is:\n        Input for the entire system: \n          First program: two integers (n, k) and then n integers.\n        Output of first program: an integer (say S)\n        Input to second program: the string representation of S? But note the second program expects a string of 0/1? \n        This is a problem.\n\n    After re-examining the problem: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we have three independent programs that we are to chain? \n    But the inputs and outputs do not match. \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n    We have two possibilities:\n      1. The chain is not arbitrary and we are to run the three programs in sequence on the same initial input? \n         But each program has its own input format.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n    So we must read the entire input at the beginning (which is the input for the first program) and then pass the output of each as the input to the next without I/O.\n\n    But the first program expects: \n        n, k and then n integers.\n\n    The second program expects a string (which in the original code is read as a single token of 0/1s).\n\n    The third program expects a string (which in the original code is read as a single token of digits and possibly '?').\n\n    How to reconcile? \n\n    The problem does not specify that the programs are chained by the same data, but by the output of the previous. \n\n    Therefore, we must design the Fortran program as:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, k, and an array of n integers).\n        Step 2: Process the first program: sort the array, take the first k and sum -> we get an integer S.\n        Step 3: Use the integer S as the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of 0/1s? \n                 But S is an integer, so we must convert S to a string? However, the second program is designed for a string of 0/1s? \n\n    This implies that the chain is broken. \n\n    Let me check the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n    The behavior of the entire sequence: \n        Input: the input for the first program (n, k, and n integers) and then the second and third programs would run on the output of the previous.\n\n    But the second program is not designed to take an arbitrary integer? It is designed for a string of 0/1s? \n\n    This suggests that the chain might be intended to run on the same initial input? But that doesn't make sense because the second program expects a string.\n\n    Alternatively, the problem might have intended the programs to be independent and the chain is defined by the user? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n    After careful thought, I think there is a misunderstanding. The three programs are independent and the chain is artificial? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\"\n\n    So the intention is that the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n    Therefore, we must convert the output of the first program (an integer) to a string of digits (in base 10) and then feed that string to the second program.\n\n    However, the second program (atcoder_ABC124_C) is designed to process a string of '0' and '1' to make it alternating. \n    But if we give it a string of decimal digits (like '123'), it will still run: \n        It will try to make the string of decimal digits alternating? \n\n    This is not the intended use of the second program? But we have to follow the chain.\n\n    Similarly, the output of the second program is an integer (the minimum number of changes) and we then convert that integer to a string (in base 10) and feed to the third program.\n\n    The third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) processes a string that may contain '?' and digits? But the string we give it is the string representation of an integer? \n    It will contain only digits? Then the program will run the DP for the entire string (without '?') and compute the number of ways (mod 13) that the number is divisible by 13 and ending with 5? \n    But note: the third program does not actually use the '?' in the example because the string we give is just digits? \n\n    So the chain is:\n        Input: n, k, and n integers.\n        Step1: compute S = sum of the first k smallest of the array.\n        Step2: convert S to a string (of decimal digits) -> call this string1.\n        Step3: process string1 with the second program: \n            The second program has two ways: \n                a. Forward: \n                    Start with the first character. Then for each next, if it's same as previous, flip it and count a flip.\n                b. Backward: \n                    Start from the end and flip backwards.\n            Then it takes the minimum of the two counts and outputs that integer, say T.\n\n        Step4: convert T to a string (of decimal digits) -> call this string2.\n        Step5: process string2 with the third program: \n            The third program does a DP for the string of digits (without any '?' because the string2 is just digits) to count the number of ways the number mod13 equals 5? \n            But note: the problem says the string may contain '?' but in our case it doesn't. So we can skip the '?' branch.\n\n            Actually, the program is written to handle both: if the character is '?' then it tries 0-9, otherwise it uses the digit.\n\n            However, our string2 has no '?' so we only use the branch for fixed digit.\n\n        Step6: output the result of the third program: dp[length-1][5] mod (1e9+7)\n\n    But wait: the third program's output is the number of ways to replace the '?' such that the number mod13=5? \n    In our case, there are no '?' so the number of ways is either 1 (if the number mod13 is 5) or 0? \n\n    However, the program does not check for '?' in the input? It does: \n        if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... } else { ... }\n\n    In our case, we are in the else branch.\n\n    And the DP state: \n        dp[i][r] = number of ways for the suffix of length i (from the end) to form the remainder r mod13.\n\n    But without any '?', the number is fixed? Then the entire DP will have only one non-zero state? \n\n    However, the program does: \n        For each position, we take the current digit and then update the state.\n\n        Actually, the DP is deterministic: \n          state j: current remainder for the suffix we've processed so far (from the end).\n          Then we add the current digit and then multiply the base (which is 10^i mod13) and add to the previous state.\n\n        But without any choices, there is exactly one path. \n\n        So at the end, we get dp[length-1][5] which will be 1 if the entire number mod13 is 5, else 0.\n\n    But the problem? The third program is designed for a string that might have '?'? We are giving a string without '?'.\n\n    So the chain is defined by the outputs and inputs as strings? \n\n    Therefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and an array of n integers.\n\n        Step 2: Sort the array and take the sum of the first k -> integer S.\n\n        Step 3: Convert S to a string (in base10) -> this is the input to the second program.\n\n        Step 4: For the string (from step3), we need to compute the minimum number of flips to make it alternating? \n                 But note: the second program was designed for a string of '0' and '1'. We are giving it a string of decimal digits (which are in '0'..'9'). \n                 The program will run, but it will compare each adjacent pair and if they are equal, it will flip one of them to the opposite (if it was '0', flip to '1', if it was '1', flip to '0')? \n                 But what if we have a digit like '2'? The program does:\n\n                    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n                        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n                        else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n                    }\n\n                 For a digit that is not '0' or '1', it will be in the else branch? So if we have two adjacent '2's, it will flip the second to '1'. \n\n                 Then the program continues. \n\n                 This algorithm was designed for binary strings? Now we are applying it to a decimal string? \n\n        This is a problem. \n\n    After rethinking, I suspect that the chain is not intended to be on the same data? But the problem states: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we run the three programs one after the other, with the output of the first becoming the input of the second, and so on.\n\n    Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the chain is as follows:\n\n        Program1: input is (n, k, array) -> output: integer S (the sum) -> then we convert S to a string of decimal digits.\n\n        Program2: input is that string -> output: integer T (the minimum number of flips to make the string alternating, where a flip is changing a digit to either '0' or '1'? But the program only flips to '0' or '1'? \n\n        However, the program does not check for non-binary? It just runs. \n\n        Then Program3: input is the string representation of T (because T is an integer) -> then we run the DP for that string (which is a string of decimal digits) and output the number of ways the number mod13=5? But without '?' it will be 1 if T mod13=5, else 0.\n\n    But note: the output of the second program is an integer T. Then we must convert T to a string to feed to the third program.\n\n    Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n        Reads: n, k, and an array of n integers.\n\n        Step1: sort the array and compute S = sum of the first k.\n\n        Step2: convert S to a string (call it s1)\n\n        Step3: process s1 with the second program's logic (which was designed for binary, but we run it on any string) to compute T.\n\n        Step4: convert T to a string (call it s2)\n\n        Step5: process s2 with the third program's logic (DP for mod13) to compute the result.\n\n        Step6: print the result.\n\n    However, the second program in Java has two methods: one from left to right and one from right to left, then takes the minimum. \n    The flipping rule: \n        If two adjacent are the same, flip the second (in the forward pass) to the opposite of the first? \n        But note: the opposite for a non-binary digit? The program does:\n            if the current char is '1', then flip to '0'; otherwise flip to '1'. \n        This only works for binary. For non-binary, if we have a '2', then we flip it to '1' (because it's not '1'). \n        Then if we have two '2's: \n            Initially: \"22\"\n            After forward: \n                i=1: compare s1[0]='2' and s1[1]='2' -> equal -> flip s1[1] to '1' -> becomes \"21\", count=1.\n            Then next: compare '2' and '1' -> not equal -> no flip.\n\n        Similarly, backward pass: \n            Start from the end: \n                i = len-1: compare s1[len-1] and s1[len-2]: \n                    if equal, then flip the left one: \n                        if the left one is '1' -> flip to '0'; else to '1'. \n            For \"22\": \n                flip the left one: becomes \"12\", count=1.\n\n        Then T = min(1,1)=1.\n\n    So we can run the same logic on a decimal digit string? It will work? But note: the goal is to make the string alternating? \n    But after flipping, the string might still have non-binary digits? \n\n    However, the problem does not specify the domain. We are just translating the chain.\n\n    So we will implement the same flipping rules for any character: \n        When flipping, we set:\n            if the current char is '1', then set to '0'; else set to '1'. \n        This is done regardless of the original value? \n\n    Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        We'll have to do:\n\n        Step 1: Read input for the first program.\n\n        Step 2: Compute S.\n\n        Step 3: Convert S to a string (s1)\n\n        Step 4: Apply the second program's logic to s1 to get T.\n\n        Step 5: Convert T to a string (s2)\n\n        Step 6: Apply the third program's logic to s2 to get the result (mod 1e9+7) and print.\n\n    However, note: the third program expects a string that might have '?'? Our s2 is just digits, so no '?'.\n\n    Implementation details:\n\n        Step 2: \n            Sort the array (of size n) and take the first k and sum.\n\n        Step 3: \n            Convert integer S to string s1.\n\n        Step 4: \n            We have two passes for s1:\n                Pass1 (forward): \n                    a = s1 (we'll use an array of characters)\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for i from 2 to len(s1) (Fortran: 2 to LEN_TRIM(s1))? \n                        if a(i) == a(i-1) then\n                            if a(i) == '1' then \n                                a(i) = '0'\n                            else \n                                a(i) = '1'\n                            end if\n                            count1 = count1 + 1\n                        end if\n\n                Pass2 (backward): \n                    b = s1 (original string again)\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for i from len(s1) down to 2\n                        if b(i) == b(i-1) then\n                            if b(i-1) == '1' then \n                                b(i-1) = '0'\n                            else \n                                b(i-1) = '1'\n                            end if\n                            count2 = count2 + 1\n                        end if\n\n                T = min(count1, count2)\n\n        Step 5: Convert T to string s2.\n\n        Step 6: \n            We run the DP for the string s2 (which is the representation of T) to compute the number of ways? \n            But note: the third program processes the string from right to left? \n\n            Steps:\n                Let L = len(s2)\n                We'll have dp(0:12) for the current state (remainder) and update for each digit.\n\n                We traverse the string from the last character to the first.\n\n                Let base = 1 (mod13) and then for each digit we update base = (base * 10) mod 13.\n\n                Actually, the Java program does:\n                    for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                        // cs is the string, and they are processing from the last character to the first? \n                        // because: cs[cs.length - 1 - i]\n\n                So we can process the string in reverse order.\n\n                We'll have an array dp_prev(0:12) for the state of the suffix processed so far.\n\n                Initialize: \n                    dp_prev(0) = 1   [for the empty suffix, we have remainder 0?] \n                    but for the first digit (the last character of the string), we do:\n\n                Steps for the DP:\n\n                  MODVAL = 1000000007\n                  base = 1\n                  dp(0:12) for the current position (starting with the last character) -> initially for no digits we have state 0.\n\n                  We'll iterate from the last character to the first (i.e., reverse the string? or traverse backwards).\n\n                  Actually, we can traverse the string from the end to the beginning.\n\n                  For each character c at position i (from the last to the first) in s2:\n\n                    Let d = integer value of c.\n\n                    Then for each remainder r_prev in 0..12:\n\n                         new_rem = (d * base + r_prev) mod 13\n\n                         Then we add dp_prev(r_prev) to dp_current(new_rem)\n\n                    Then update base = (base * 10) mod 13.\n\n                  But note: the Java program does:\n\n                      for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                         index = cs.length - 1 - i   // so the last character is at i=0, then the next to last at i=1? \n                         Actually, for i=0: index = last, then i=1: index = last-1, etc.\n\n                  And they update base at the end of the loop: base = base * 10 % 13.\n\n                  Also, they use a 2D dp array: dp[i][r] for the state after processing the first i+1 digits (from the end).\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                      Let dp(0:12) be the state for the current suffix (starting with the empty suffix: dp(0)=1, others 0).\n\n                      For i = 1 to len(s2)  [we are going to process the i-th digit from the end]\n\n                         new_dp(0:12) = 0\n\n                         Let d = the digit at position (len(s2) - i + 1) [if we index the string from 1 to L]\n\n                         But in Fortran, we can index the string: \n                            Let s2 = \"1234\", then we want to start from the last character: position L, then L-1, etc.\n\n                         For each remainder r from 0 to 12:\n\n                             new_rem = (d * base + r) mod 13\n\n                             new_dp(new_rem) = (new_dp(new_rem) + dp(r)) mod MODVAL\n\n                         Then set dp = new_dp\n\n                         base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n                  After processing all digits, the answer is dp(5)\n\n            But note: the Java program has no '?' in our case, so we don't need the loop for next=0 to 9.\n\n        Step 7: Print dp(5)\n\n    However, note: the third program outputs dp[dp.length-1][5] which is the state after processing the entire string and remainder 5.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Important: We must use modulo 1000000007 for the DP.\n\n    But note: the second program outputs an integer T, which might be large? The first program: S <= 100000? (if k<=1000 and each integer <=100, then S<=100000). \n    Then the second program: T is at most the length of the string (which is at most 6 for S up to 100000) so T <= 6? \n\n    Then the third program: the string s2 is the string representation of T (so at most 1 digit? if T=0..9 then 1 digit, if T=10.. then 2 digits). \n\n    So the DP for the third program will be over a string of length 1 or 2.\n\n    Example: \n        Step1: n=3, k=2, array = [3,1,2] -> sorted=[1,2,3] -> S=1+2=3.\n        Step2: s1 = \"3\"\n        Step3: \n            Forward for \"3\": \n                only one character -> no adjacent -> T1=0\n            Backward: same -> T2=0\n            T = 0.\n\n        Step4: s2 = \"0\"\n\n        Step5: \n            Process the string \"0\": \n                base = 1\n                digit = 0 (from the last character? the string has only one character -> last is the only one)\n                dp_prev: initially [1,0,...,0] (only state0=1)\n\n                Then for the digit 0:\n                    for each state r in 0..12:\n                         new_rem = (0*1 + r) mod13 = r\n                    So new_dp(r) = dp_prev(r) for each r? \n\n                Then base = 1*10 mod13 = 10.\n\n                Then the next character? none.\n\n                Then the answer is dp_prev(5) = 0? because initially we had state0=1, then we set new_dp(r)=dp_prev(r) so state5 remains 0.\n\n            Output: 0.\n\n        But the Java program for the third program: \n            Input \"0\": \n                cs = ['0']\n                i=0: index = 0 (the last character is the only one) -> then base=1.\n                Then we do: \n                    if the char is not '?', then next = 0.\n                    For pre from 0 to 12: \n                         new_rem = (1*0 + pre) % 13 = pre\n                         Then we set dp[0][new_rem] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (if pre==0? 1:0))\n                For i=0 (the first digit from the end): \n                    we are at i=0, so we use the else branch: we add 1 to dp[0][pre] only when pre==0? \n                    Actually: \n                         dp[0][ (0 + pre) % 13 ] += (if i>0? ... : (pre==0?1:0))\n                    So for pre=0: we add 1 to dp[0][0]. \n                    For others, we add 0.\n\n                Then base = 1*10 mod13 = 10.\n\n                Then we output dp[0][5] -> which is 0.\n\n        So we get 0.\n\n    But the expected output of the entire chain? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". We are following the chain.\n\n    So we code accordingly.\n\n    Implementation in Fortran:\n\n        We'll use:\n          implicit none\n\n        Step1: read n, k, and array of n integers.\n\n        Step2: sort the array (using a simple sort or the Fortran intrinsic) and compute S = sum of the first k.\n\n        Step3: convert S to a string (using internal write)\n\n        Step4: \n            Let s1 = the string from step3.\n            Let L = len_trim(s1)   [if we use fixed length, we can use the entire string? but the conversion might have leading spaces?]\n\n            Actually, internal write will give a string without leading spaces? \n\n            We'll use:\n\n                character(len=20) :: s1\n                write(s1, '(I0)') S   ! This will write without leading spaces.\n\n            Then we set L = len_trim(s1) and work on s1(1:L)\n\n            Then do two passes:\n\n                count1 = 0\n                a = s1(1:L)   ! we make a copy so we can modify\n                do i = 2, L\n                    if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n                        if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n                            a(i:i) = '0'\n                        else\n                            a(i:i) = '1'\n                        end if\n                        count1 = count1 + 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                count2 = 0\n                b = s1(1:L)   ! original string\n                do i = L, 2, -1\n                    if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n                        if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                            b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n                        else\n                            b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n                        end if\n                        count2 = count2 + 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                T = min(count1, count2)\n\n        Step5: convert T to string s2:\n\n                character(len=20) :: s2\n                write(s2, '(I0)') T\n                Let M = len_trim(s2)\n\n        Step6: \n            We do the DP for the string s2(1:M) in reverse order (from last character to first).\n\n            MODVAL = 1000000007\n            base = 1\n            dp = array of 13 integers, initialized to 0\n            dp(0) = 1   ! state0: remainder 0 for the empty suffix\n\n            We'll use:\n                integer, dimension(0:12) :: dp, new_dp\n\n            Then for each character from last to first (i.e., from M down to 1):\n\n                new_dp = 0   ! we'll compute new states for this digit\n\n                d = ichar(s2(i:i)) - ichar('0')   ! convert to integer digit\n\n                For each current remainder r in 0..12:\n\n                    rem_new = mod(d * base + r, 13)\n                    new_dp(rem_new) = mod(new_dp(rem_new) + dp(r), MODVAL)\n\n                Then set dp = new_dp\n\n                base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n            After the loop, the result is dp(5)\n\n        Step7: print dp(5)\n\n    However, note: the Java program does the digits from the last to the first, but in the order of the string? \n        They have a loop for i in 0 to len-1, and they use the character at (len-1-i). \n        So we can do:\n\n            for i = 1 to M   [but we want to start with the last character?]\n\n            We can index the string from the last character to the first:\n\n                do j = M, 1, -1\n\n            Then for each j:\n\n                d = digit at j\n\n            Then update the dp.\n\n        But note: the base in the Java program starts at 1 for the last digit, then 10, then 100 mod13, etc.\n\n        We are doing:\n\n            base = 1 at the beginning of the loop (for the last digit) -> then update base = base * 10 mod13 for the next digit (which is the one before the last).\n\n        This matches.\n\n    Therefore, the Fortran code:\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          program combined\n          implicit none\n\n          !

The first program in Java uses parallelSort. \n        But we can use a simple quicksort? or use the Fortran intrinsic? \n\n        Fortran doesn't have a standard sort for integer arrays? We can use an external sort.\n\n        We'll write a simple bubble sort? That is O(n^2) and n can be 100000 -> too slow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the `sort` from the intrinsic module? But Fortran 90 doesn't have one. \n\n        We can use a heap sort? or use an available library? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. We must be efficient? \n\n        Since the Java program uses parallelSort (which is a parallel merge sort), we can use a quicksort.\n\n        We'll write a recursive quicksort? But Fortran doesn't like recursion for large arrays? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the `qsort` from the C library? But the problem says Fortran.\n\n        We can write a simple quick sort in Fortran.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify the constraints? But the original Java program handles up to 100000? \n\n        We can use an efficient sort. I'll write a recursive quicksort.\n\n        But we are not sure about the stack size? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the selection sort for the first k? \n\n        Since we only need the first k smallest, we can do:\n\n            Use a partial sort: find the k smallest.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Use a max-heap of size k? \n\n        But Fortran doesn't have a heap.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We can use the fact that k is small? The Java program: k <= n, but note k can be large? \n\n        Actually, the first program: n and k are read, and k<=n, but n can be up to 100000.\n\n        We can use the Fortran intrinsic to sort the entire array? \n\n        But Fortran doesn't have an intrinsic sort? \n\n        Actually, Fortran 2003 and later have the `intrinsic` module? But we are not sure.\n\n        Let me check: we can use `sort` from `iso_fortran_env`? Not available.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an external subroutine from a library? \n\n        But the problem doesn't specify the Fortran version.\n\n        We'll write a quicksort.\n\n        However, to keep it simple and portable, we can use a built-in? \n\n        Actually, we can use the `sort` function from the GNU extension? But we want standard.\n\n        I found: we can use the `qsort` from the C standard library via Fortran's C binding? But that complicates.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we'll write a recursive quicksort and hope the stack is enough.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a non-recursive sort? \n\n        I'll write a simple recursive quicksort.\n\n        But note: the array is of integers.\n\n        Subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n\n        However, we don't need to sort the entire array? We need the first k smallest. We can do a partial sort? \n\n        We can use the selection algorithm? \n\n        We can find the k-th smallest and then partition? \n\n        But the original program sorts the entire array and then takes the first k. \n\n        We'll sort the entire array.\n\n        Steps for quicksort:\n\n          recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(*)\n          integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n          integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n          if (low < high) then\n             pivot = arr(high)\n             i = low-1\n             do j = low, high-1\n                if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                   i = i+1\n                   temp = arr(i)\n                   arr(i) = arr(j)\n                   arr(j) = temp\n                end if\n             end do\n             temp = arr(i+1)\n             arr(i+1) = arr(high)\n             arr(high) = temp\n             call quicksort(arr, low, i)\n             call quicksort(arr, i+2, high)\n          end if\n\n        But this is the Lomuto partition which is inefficient.\n\n        Alternatively, Hoare's partition:\n\n          subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(*)\n          integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n          integer :: i, j, pivot, temp\n\n          if (low < high) then\n             pivot = arr(low + (high-low)/2)   ! or use the middle\n             i = low-1\n             j = high+1\n             do \n                do \n                   i = i+1\n                   if (arr(i) >= pivot) exit\n                end do\n                do \n                   j = j-1\n                   if (arr(j) <= pivot) exit\n                end do\n                if (i>=j) exit\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = temp\n             end do\n             call quicksort(arr, low, j)\n             call quicksort(arr, j+1, high)\n          end if\n\n        But we'll use the Hoare partition.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the indices.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `qsort` via the `iso_c_binding`? \n\n        But to avoid complexity, we'll write a non-recursive quicksort? \n\n        Given the time, we'll write a recursive one and hope that the stack is enough for 100000.\n\n        But worst-case recursion depth is O(n). \n\n        We can do iterative quicksort? \n\n        Actually, we can use the `sort` from the standard library if we assume a modern Fortran? \n\n        But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Let me assume we are allowed to use the Fortran 2008 standard? It doesn't have a sort.\n\n        We'll write a recursive quicksort with random pivot to avoid worst-case.\n\n        But for simplicity, we use the first element? \n\n        We'll use the Hoare partition with middle element.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          module qsort_mod\n          contains\n          recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n          integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n          integer :: i, j, pivot, temp, mid\n\n          if (low < high) then\n             mid = low + (high - low) / 2\n             pivot = arr(mid)\n             i = low\n             j = high\n             do \n                do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n                   i = i+1\n                end do\n                do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n                   j = j-1\n                end do\n                if (i >= j) exit\n                ! swap arr(i) and arr(j)\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = temp\n                i = i+1\n                j = j-1\n             end do\n             call quicksort(arr, low, j)\n             call quicksort(arr, j+1, high)\n          end if\n          end subroutine\n          end module\n\n        But note: the above partition might not be standard.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `sort` from the `stdlib`? \n\n        We are not sure if we are allowed.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since n can be up to 100000, we should use an efficient sort.\n\n        But the problem says \"entire sequence\", and we are free to implement as long as the behavior is the same.\n\n        We'll use the `qsort` from the C library via Fortran's C binding.\n\n        However, to keep it self-contained, we'll write a heap sort.\n\n        Heap sort:\n\n          subroutine heapsort(n, arr)\n          integer, intent(in) :: n\n          integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n          integer :: i, temp\n\n          ! Build heap\n          do i = n/2, 1, -1\n             call heapify(arr, n, i)\n          end do\n\n          ! Extract\n          do i = n, 2, -1\n             ! swap root (max) with last\n             temp = arr(1)\n             arr(1) = arr(i)\n             arr(i) = temp\n             call heapify(arr, i-1, 1)\n          end do\n\n          But note: this builds a max-heap and then sorts in increasing order? \n\n          However, we want increasing order.\n\n          After sorting, the array is increasing? \n\n          Actually: \n            Build a max-heap: then the largest is at root. Then we swap the root (largest) to the end, and then heapify the rest. \n            So the array becomes increasing order.\n\n          But we want the smallest first? Then we need to reverse? \n\n          Alternatively, we can build a min-heap? \n\n          But standard heap sort with max-heap gives increasing order? \n\n          Example: [3,1,2] \n            Build heap: \n                n=3, i from 1 to 1? \n                i=1: \n                    heapify at 1: \n                        left=2, right=3? \n                        if left<=n and arr(left)>arr(largest) -> then largest=left? \n                        if right<=n and arr(right)>arr(largest) -> largest=right? \n                        then swap arr(1) and arr(largest) -> then we get [3,1,2] -> no change.\n\n            Then extract:\n                i=3: swap arr(1) and arr(3) -> [2,1,3]\n                then heapify(2,1): \n                    largest=1, left=2: arr(2)=1, right=3? not present -> so if left>largest? \n                    largest=1, then if left=2: 2<=2 and arr(2)=1 < arr(1)=2 -> so no swap.\n\n                then i=2: swap arr(1) and arr(2) -> [1,2,3] -> then heapify(1,1): nothing.\n\n            So we get [1,2,3]? \n\n          So it works.\n\n        But the heap sort is O(n log n) and in-place.\n\n        We'll write heapify:\n\n          subroutine heapify(arr, n, i)\n          integer :: arr(n), n, i\n          integer :: largest, l, r, temp\n\n          largest = i\n          l = 2*i\n          r = 2*i+1\n\n          if (l <= n) then\n             if (arr(l) > arr(largest)) then\n                 largest = l\n             end if\n          end if\n\n          if (r <= n) then\n             if (arr(r) > arr(largest)) then\n                 largest = r\n             end if\n          end if\n\n          if (largest /= i) then\n             temp = arr(i)\n             arr(i) = arr(largest)\n             arr(largest) = temp\n             call heapify(arr, n, largest)\n          end if\n          end subroutine\n\n        But note: we use 1-indexed.\n\n        We are reading the array from index 1 to n.\n\n        So we use heap sort.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          call heapsort(n, arr)\n\n        Then the array is sorted in increasing order.\n\n    Therefore, the complete Fortran code:\n\n        We'll include the heap sort.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Note: the entire program might be long, but we'll write it.\n\n    However, note: the second program's flipping: we are modifying copies of the string? \n\n    We are using:\n\n        a = s1(1:L)   -> this copies the string? \n\n        But in Fortran, we can assign strings.\n\n    We are done.\n\n    Let's write the code.\n\n    Note: the heap sort is recursive in heapify? But the depth is O(log n) so it's safe.\n\n    We'll write the heap sort non-recursive in heapify? We can do iterative heapify? \n\n    But the recursive heapify is acceptable.\n\n    Code structure:\n\n        module heapsort_mod\n        contains\n        recursive subroutine heapify(arr, n, i)\n        ... as above ...\n\n        subroutine heapsort(n, arr)\n        ... as above ...\n\n        end module\n\n        program combined\n        use heapsort_mod\n        ... rest ...\n\n    But we can put the subroutines in the main program? \n\n    Alternatively, we can put them at the end.\n\n    We'll put the heap sort subroutines at the end.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Important: the array indexing: we are using 1-indexed for the array.\n\n    When we read the array: do i=1, n -> arr(i)\n\n    The heap sort also uses 1-indexed.\n\n    Now, the entire program.\n\n    Note: the second program's string copies: we have to be cautious with the string lengths.\n\n    We'll declare:\n\n        character(len=20) :: s1, s2\n        character(len=20) :: a, b   ! they will have the same length as s1? \n\n        a = s1   ! copies the entire 20 characters? but we only care about the first L.\n\n        Then when we do a(i:i), we use i from 1 to L.\n\n    This is safe.\n\n    We'll run and hope.\n\n    Let me test with a small example: n=3, k=2, array=[3,1,2] -> S=3, then T=0, then DP on \"0\" -> result=0.\n\n    But the third program: the result is 0? \n\n    We output 0.\n\n    Now, we write the code.\n\n    Note: the third program's DP: \n        base = 1\n        dp(0)=1, others 0.\n        Then for the string \"0\": \n            j = 1 (the only character) -> d=0.\n            new_dp = [0,0,...,0]\n            for r=0: new_rem = (0*1+0) mod13=0 -> new_dp(0) = 0+dp(0)=1.\n            Then set dp = new_dp: dp(0)=1, others 0.\n            Then base = 1*10 mod13=10.\n        Then ans = dp(5)=0.\n\n    So we output 0.\n\n    Now, if we use the example from the first program's comments? \n\n    But note: the second program was originally designed for binary, but we are using decimal. \n\n    We are following the chain.\n\n    We code accordingly.\n\n    Due to the complexity, we'll write the entire Fortran program."
