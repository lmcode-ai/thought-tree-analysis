Then we multiply by 1 (factor=1) for the first, then by 10 for the next? That means the first digit (i=1) becomes the least significant? and the last digit (i=ndigits) becomes the most significant? That is correct. But what if the transformed digit is 9? Then it's 0? But we avoid that for the most significant? Only when we are at the last digit (x==0 after extraction) and 9-r==0, we leave it as r. So for example, if the number is 9, then we get r=9, and then we check: 9-9=0, and then we are at the last digit? Actually, when we extract 9, then x becomes 0 (because 9/10=0) so we are at the last digit. Then we cannot set it to 0? So we leave it as 9? Correct. Example: 9 -> becomes 9? because 9-9=0 and we avoid leading zero? Then the number is 9. But what about 19? Step1: extract 9 -> becomes 0? (because 9-9=0, but then we are not at the last digit? because after extracting 9, x becomes 1 (then we extract 1). Then we set 9 to 0? Then the digits we store: first (least) is 0, then next we extract 1: then 9-1=8 which is less than 1? Actually, 9-1=8, which is greater than 1? So we leave 1 as 1? Then the new number is 10? Actually: \n          19: \n            first digit (least): 9 -> 0?

Actually, 8>1? so we leave it as 1? then the number is 1 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0 = 10. But the expected transformation? We want to minimize the number?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note the following:\n1. The first program (codeforces_629_A) reads an integer `num` and then `num` strings. It outputs a single integer (the value of `fine`).\n2. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string and outputs a single integer modulo 1e9+7 (the value of `dp[dp.length-1][5]`).\n3. The third program (codeforces_514_A) reads a long integer and outputs a transformed long integer.\n\nBut the output of the first program is an integer, which is to be used as the input for the second program. However, the second program expects a string (a sequence of digits). Similarly, the output of the second program is an integer, which is to be the input for the third program (which expects a long integer).\n\nTherefore, we must design the Fortran program to:\n- First, read the input for the first program (an integer `n` and then `n` strings of length `n` each? because it's an n x n grid of characters).\n- Then, compute the result of the first program (an integer, say `fine`).\n- Then, convert this integer `fine` to a string and use it as the input for the second program (which processes a string of digits and possibly '?' but note the second program only expects digits and '?' and in our case the integer `fine` is a nonnegative integer so we can convert to a string of digits).\n- The second program then outputs a long integer (which is the result of the DP computation modulo 1e9+7, and then we take the result at state 5).\n- Then, use that long integer (which is the output of the second program) as the input for the third program.\n\nHowever, note that the second program actually expects a string that may contain '?' but in our case, the integer `fine` is a fixed number so we don't have any '?'. But the second program is designed to handle '?' as wildcards. Since we are converting the integer `fine` to a string of digits, there will be no '?' so we can simplify the second program's logic for the case without '?'.\n\nBut we must be cautious: the second program processes the string from rightmost character to leftmost (i.e., reversed). Also, note that the base is updated as base = base * 10 % 13.\n\nGiven the complexity, we must chain the three programs without intermediate I/O.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read the first integer `n` and then `n` strings (each of length `n`? because the next loops run for `num` and each string is of length `num`?).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the `fine` integer).\n\n3. Convert `fine` to a string. However, note that the second program expects a string that might have leading zeros? But the first program's output is a nonnegative integer without leading zeros. Also, the second program can handle any string of digits.\n\n4. Run the second program's logic on the string representation of `fine`. But note: the second program is designed for a string that might have wildcards, but we don't have any. So we can use the branch for non-wildcards.\n\n5. The result of the second program is a long integer (the value at state 5 for the entire string). We then take that result and use it as the input for the third program.\n\n6. The third program transforms the number: for each digit, if 9-digit is less than the digit and non-zero (with a special case for the leading digit: we don't want a leading zero) then replace the digit by 9-digit.\n\nBut note: the third program reads a long integer and processes it from least significant digit to most. Then it reconstructs the number.\n\nHowever, the challenge is that the three programs are written in Java and we must combine them in Fortran without any I/O in between.\n\nWe'll write a Fortran program that:\n- Reads the input for the first program (n and n strings of n characters each).\n- Computes the first program's result (fine).\n- Converts fine to a string (without any extra characters, just the decimal representation).\n- Then, for the second program, we process the string from the last character (least significant) to the first? Actually, the second program reverses the string: it processes from the last character (index cs.length-1) to the first (index 0). But note: the string we get from `fine` is in normal order (most significant first). The second program reverses the index: `cs[cs.length - 1 - i]`. So we can either reverse the string or process in reverse order.\n\nBut note: the base is updated as base = base * 10 % 13, and the base is initially 1 and then multiplied by 10 mod 13 at each step. The DP state: \n   dp[i][ (base * next + pre) % 13 ] += ... \n\nWe are going to process the string from rightmost (least significant) to leftmost (most significant). So we can keep the string as is and process from the last character backwards? Actually, the Java code uses `cs.length - 1 - i` to get the character at position `i` from the end. So if we have the string in normal order, the last character is the least significant. We can process the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, we can reverse the string so that the first character we process is the least significant? Actually, in the Fortran code, we can index the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nBut note: the base is increasing by a factor of 10 for each digit to the left. In the second program, the base for the i-th character (from the end) is base = (10^i) mod 13.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  Let s = string representation of `fine`\n  Let len = LEN_TRIM(s)   ? But note: we have the exact digits without spaces.\n\nActually, we can get the length of the string.\n\nWe'll create an array dp(0:12) for the current state and then update for each digit. We'll do:\n\n  dp_prev(0:12) for the state after processing the previous digits (starting from the end) and then update to dp_current.\n\nWe start with the base = 1, and then for each digit from the last character to the first (i.e., from the least significant to the most significant) we update the dp.\n\nSteps for the second program:\n\n  MOD = 1000000007\n  dp_prev(0) = 1   [because at the start, for the first digit we are processing, the remainder is 0? and we haven't processed any digit, so the base is 1 and we are going to add the first digit?]\n\n  Actually, in the Java code, for i=0 (the first digit we process, which is the last character of the string), we consider the digit at the last position. The state: \n      dp[0][ (base * next) % 13 ] += 1   [if pre=0 and we are at the first step]\n\n  Then for the next digit (moving left), base becomes 10 mod 13? and then we multiply that digit by base and add to the previous state.\n\nSo we can simulate:\n\n  base = 1\n  dp(0:12) = [0,0,...,0] except dp(0)=1\n\n  Then for i from len down to 1 (if we index from 1 to len) we process the i-th character? Actually, we need to traverse the string backwards.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      do i = len, 1, -1\n          next = digit at position i (converted to integer)\n          new_dp = 0 for all states\n          for pre = 0 to 12\n              if dp(pre) > 0 then\n                 state = (base * next + pre) % 13\n                 new_dp(state) = (new_dp(state) + dp(pre)) % MOD\n              end if\n          end do\n          then set dp = new_dp\n          base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n  But wait, the Java code does not condition on dp[pre] being non-zero? It just iterates and adds. We can do without condition.\n\n  However, note: the Java code for a non-wildcard digit only uses one next value. So we do:\n\n      do pre = 0, 12\n          state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n          dp_current(state) = (dp_current(state) + dp_prev(pre)) % MOD\n      end do\n\n  And then update base and set dp_prev = dp_current (and then reset dp_current to zero for the next iteration).\n\n  But note: the Java code does the same for each digit without wildcard.\n\n  Since our string has no wildcards, we only have one digit per position.\n\n  Then at the end, the result is dp_prev(5) (since we processed all digits).\n\n7. Then we take the result (a long integer, which is dp_prev(5)) and use it as the input for the third program.\n\n8. The third program: \n   - It reads a long integer (the result from the second program, say `x`).\n   - Then it processes each digit of `x` from least significant to most significant (by repeatedly taking x mod 10 and then x = x/10).\n   - For each digit `r`:\n          if (9 - r) < r and (if it's the most significant digit then avoid making it 0) then we use 9-r, else we use r.\n          But note: the condition for the most significant: if we are at the last digit (when x becomes 0 after this digit) and 9-r is 0, then we use the original digit.\n\n   However, note that in the third program, the digits are processed from least to most, and then stored in a list. Then the list is used to form the number by taking the i-th element and multiplying by 10^i (starting from the first element in the list being the least significant, so when we reconstruct we do: newNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * (10^i) for i from 0 to size-1? but note the loop: the first digit we process (the least significant) is stored first in the list. Then when reconstructing, we start with pow=0 and then add list.get(0) * 10^0, then list.get(1)*10^1, etc. So the first element in the list becomes the least significant? Actually, no: because we are building the number by starting at the least significant and then adding more significant digits? Actually, the reconstruction is:\n\n        newNumber = 0\n        pow = 0\n        for i=0 to list.size()-1:\n            newNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * (10^pow)\n            pow++\n\n        But the list has the digits from least significant (the first digit we processed) to the most significant (the last digit we processed). So the first element in the list is the least significant? Then when we multiply by 10^0, that's correct. Then the next digit is more significant (by 10^1). So we are building the number correctly.\n\n   However, note: the transformation might change the number of digits? For example, if the most significant digit becomes 0? But we avoid that: if we are at the most significant digit (when x/10==0) and 9-r==0, we leave it as r.\n\n   So in Fortran, we can do:\n\n        x = result_from_second_program\n        if (x == 0) then ... we have to handle 0? Because the third program doesn't read 0? Actually, the third program: while (x>0). So if x is 0, we skip the loop? Then we output 0? But note the third program: if x is 0, the loop doesn't run and then we output newNumber which is 0. But we have to set newNumber=0 initially.\n\n        Alternatively, we can handle x=0 by having a special case? But the third program does:\n\n            while (x > 0) { ... }\n\n        So if x==0, the list remains empty and then newNumber=0.\n\n        But what if x is negative? The problem says: long x = sc.nextLong(); and then while (x>0). So if x is 0, we output 0? Actually, the third program doesn't handle negative. The input is a positive long? The output of the second program is nonnegative (mod result). So we are safe.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        list = []   (we can use an array, but we don't know the length? maximum 20 digits for a long integer? but Fortran integer might be 8 bytes, so up to 19 digits? We can use an array of size 20 and an index)\n\n        x = input_value (from the second program)\n        if (x==0) then\n            newNumber = 0\n        else\n            i = 0\n            allocate an array of integers, or we can use a fixed size (say 30) and count the digits.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            digits = 0\n            temp = x\n            do while (temp > 0)\n                digits = digits + 1\n                temp = temp / 10\n            end do\n\n            allocate an array of size digits? or we can use a fixed array of size 30.\n\n        But we can also avoid pre-counting and just store in a dynamic way? In Fortran we can use an array and grow it? Or we can use a fixed size.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate the Java code: store the digits in an array as we extract them.\n\n        Let:\n            i = 0\n            do while (x > 0)\n                r = mod(x, 10)\n                x = x / 10\n                if (9 - r < r) then\n                    if (x == 0 .and. (9 - r == 0)) then\n                        digit = r\n                    else\n                        digit = 9 - r\n                    end if\n                else\n                    digit = r\n                end if\n                then we store digit in an array at position i? and then i = i+1\n            end do\n\n        Then we need to form the newNumber: \n            newNumber = 0\n            power = 1  (for the least significant digit we have 10^0, then 10^1, ...)\n            do j=0, i-1   (the first digit we stored is the least significant? and then we have the next more significant? Actually, we stored the least significant first. Then the next digit we stored is the next more significant? But when we reconstruct, we start with the least significant and then add the next digit multiplied by 10, then the next by 100, etc. So:\n\n                newNumber = newNumber + digit_array(j) * (10 ** j)   [but 10**j might be too big?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid storing and just build the number as we go? But note: we have to consider the digits from least significant to most significant? Actually, we can build the number by:\n\n            newNumber = 0\n            factor = 1\n            do j = 0, i-1\n                newNumber = newNumber + digit_array(j) * factor\n                factor = factor * 10\n            end do\n\n        But note: the digit_array(0) is the least significant? Yes.\n\n9. Finally, output the newNumber.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs a long integer that might be very large? But the third program uses long integers (in Java, long is 64 bits). In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for the entire program to handle 64-bit integers.\n\nHowever, the second program uses modulo 1e9+7, so the result is at most 10^9+6, which is within the range of a 4-byte integer? But then the third program might get a number up to 10^9+6, which is about 10^9, which has 10 digits. So we can use integer(kind=8) for the third program to avoid overflow in the reconstruction? Because 10^9 * 10 is 10^10, which is within 2^35, so 8-byte integers are safe.\n\nBut note: the first program: the integer `num` and the `fine` might be large? The `fine` is the total number of pairs in rows and columns. The maximum `num` is not given, but we assume it's not too large? The input grid is `num` x `num`, so `num` might be up to 100? (because the problem is from codeforces and typical constraints). But the second program might get a string of digits that is the `fine` which might be up to (n*(n-1))? for each row/column, and then added: so maximum pairs is about 2 * (n*(n-1)/2) = n*(n-1) per row? Actually, the first program does:\n\n   For each row (or column) it counts the number of 'C', say c. Then the pairs in that row is c*(c-1)/2. Then it sums over all rows and columns.\n\n   The maximum c is n, so the maximum for one row is n*(n-1)/2. Then total fine = (number of rows + columns) * [n*(n-1)/2] maximum? Actually, no, because each row and column is independent. The maximum total is 2 * n * (n*(n-1)/2) = n^2*(n-1). For n=100, that is 100^2*99 = 990000, which is 6 digits. So the string for the second program is at most 6 digits.\n\nTherefore, the second program will process a string of at most 6 digits.\n\nNow, we design the Fortran program:\n\n  We'll use:\n      integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n      integer(kind=8) :: ... for large integers? Actually, the second program uses long in Java, which is 64 bits. But the numbers in the DP are mod 1e9+7, so they are within 32 bits? But we'll use 4-byte integers for the DP? However, the MOD is 1e9+7, which is about 2e9, so we need 4-byte integers (which can hold up to 2e9) but in Fortran, integer might be 4 bytes and the modulus is 1e9+7, so the maximum value in the DP is less than 2e9? Actually, the additions: we do modulo, so we can use 4-byte integers? But to be safe, we can use 8-byte integers for the DP? Because the intermediate sums might be large? The Java code uses long for the dp array? Actually, the dp array is of type `long[][]` in Java. So we'll use integer(kind=8) for the dp arrays and for the MOD arithmetic.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  Program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      ! For the first program\n      integer :: n, i, k, counter, fine\n      character(len=100), allocatable :: grid(:)   ! assuming n<=100, each string length n\n      character(len=100) :: s\n\n      ! For the second program\n      integer(kind=8) :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n      character(len=20) :: s_fine   ! to hold the string representation of fine\n      integer :: len_fine, j, base, digit_val\n      integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_curr(0:12)   ! dp states: 0 to 12\n      integer :: state, pre, next_digit\n\n      ! For the third program\n      integer(kind=8) :: x, r, newNumber, factor, temp\n      integer(kind=8) :: digit_list(30)   ! fixed size array for digits, max 30\n      integer :: ndigits, idx\n\n      ! Read input for the first program\n      read(*,*) n\n      allocate(grid(n))\n      do i=1, n\n          read(*,*) grid(i)\n      end do\n\n      ! First program logic\n      fine = 0\n      counter = 0\n      ! First: for each column i (from 1 to n) in the grid\n      do i=1, n\n          do k=1, n\n              if (grid(k)(i:i) == 'C') then   ! note: Fortran substring: grid(k) is a string, we take the i-th character\n                  counter = counter + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n          fine = fine + (counter * (counter - 1)) / 2\n          counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Then: for each row i (from 1 to n)\n      do i=1, n\n          do k=1, n\n              if (grid(i)(k:k) == 'C') then\n                  counter = counter + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n          fine = fine + (counter * (counter - 1)) / 2\n          counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, convert fine to string for the second program\n      write(s_fine, '(I0)') fine   ! I0 writes without leading spaces and without leading zeros, and without fixed width\n      len_fine = len_trim(s_fine)   ! but note: the string might have leading spaces? Actually, I0 writes without leading spaces? Then we can use trim? But we need the entire string including trailing? Actually, the write will put the number at the beginning and then spaces to the right? We want the entire string without trailing spaces? But we have the variable s_fine of fixed length 20. We can take the substring of the non-space part? Actually, the I0 format writes the integer without leading zeros and then pads the rest with spaces. We can use:\n\n      ! Actually, we can do: \n      !   s_fine = adjustl(s_fine)   ! to remove leading spaces? But the write with I0 should write without leading spaces? Then we can use the entire string and then take the non-space part? But we have the length via len_trim.\n\n      ! But note: we are going to process the string from the last character to the first? So we can use:\n      !   do j = len_fine, 1, -1   but we need the last character to be the least significant? Actually, the string is written in normal order: the first character is the most significant.\n\n      ! The second program: we process the string from the last character (least significant) to the first (most significant). So we can do:\n\n      !   do j = len_fine, 1, -1\n\n      ! But note: the base starts at 1 and then becomes base*10 mod 13.\n\n      ! Initialize dp_prev: \n      dp_prev = 0\n      dp_prev(0) = 1\n      base = 1\n\n      do j = len_fine, 1, -1\n          ! Read the character at j\n          next_digit = ichar(s_fine(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n          ! Initialize dp_curr to zero\n          dp_curr = 0\n          do pre = 0, 12\n              if (dp_prev(pre) > 0) then\n                  state = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n                  dp_curr(state) = dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre)\n                  ! Modulo\n                  if (dp_curr(state) >= MOD) then\n                      dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state), MOD)\n                  end if\n              end if\n          end do\n          ! But note: the Java code doesn't condition on non-zero? We can do without condition? Actually, we can loop without condition and do modulo at the end? But to be efficient, we can avoid the condition.\n\n          ! Alternatively, we can do:\n          !   do pre = 0, 12\n          !       state = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n          !       dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n          !   end do\n\n          ! But the above inner loop is small (13 states). We'll do:\n\n          ! Actually, the above inner loop I did with condition is fine. But we can do without condition? We can always add? Even if dp_prev is zero? It doesn't hurt.\n\n          ! Let me change to without condition:\n\n          do pre = 0, 12\n              state = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n              dp_curr(state) = dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre)\n          end do\n\n          ! Then modulo for each state? We can do modulo after the inner loop?\n          do state = 0, 12\n              dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state), MOD)\n          end do\n\n          ! Update base\n          base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n          ! Update dp_prev to dp_curr for next iteration\n          dp_prev = dp_curr\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, the result of the second program is dp_prev(5)\n      x = dp_prev(5)\n\n      ! Third program: transform the number x\n      newNumber = 0\n      ndigits = 0\n      temp = x\n      if (x == 0) then\n          newNumber = 0\n      else\n          ! We'll extract the digits and store in digit_list in reverse order (least significant first)\n          idx = 0\n          do while (x > 0)\n              r = mod(x, 10_8)\n              x = x / 10_8\n              if (9 - r < r) then\n                  if (x == 0 .and. (9 - r == 0)) then\n                      ! Keep r\n                      digit_list(idx+1) = r\n                  else\n                      digit_list(idx+1) = 9 - r\n                  end if\n              else\n                  digit_list(idx+1) = r\n              end if\n              idx = idx + 1\n          end do\n          ndigits = idx\n\n          ! Now, reconstruct the number: the digit_list(1) is the least significant, digit_list(ndigits) is the most significant.\n          ! But note: we want to form the number: \n          !   newNumber = 0\n          !   factor = 1\n          !   do i=1, ndigits\n          !       newNumber = newNumber + digit_list(i) * factor\n          !       factor = factor * 10\n          !   end do\n\n          factor = 1\n          do i=1, ndigits\n              newNumber = newNumber + digit_list(i) * factor\n              factor = factor * 10\n          end do\n      end if\n\n      ! Output the newNumber\n      print *, newNumber\n\n  end program\n\nHowever, note: the second program in Java has a special case for the first digit? It does:\n\n      if (i>0) then use dp[i-1] else if pre==0 then 1.\n\n  But in our initialization, we set dp_prev(0)=1 and then we process the first digit (j from len_fine to ...) and we use dp_prev which is set to [1 at 0 and 0 elsewhere]. Then we update. So it's the same.\n\nBut note: the base update: the base is updated at the end of the loop. The base for the current digit is the base at the beginning of the loop? Yes, as in the Java code: after processing the digit, they update base.\n\nAlso, the modulo operation: we do modulo for the state? The state is mod(...,13). But the base is updated as base = base * 10 mod 13? Yes.\n\nBut note: in Fortran, the mod function for integers: \n   mod(a, b) returns the remainder of a divided by b, and the sign is the same as a. But our numbers are nonnegative? So it's safe.\n\nHowever, the base * next_digit + pre might be negative? No, base is nonnegative (0 to 12), next_digit is 0-9, pre is 0-12. So it's nonnegative.\n\nAlso, the modulo for the dp_curr: we do mod(dp_curr(state), MOD) after adding? But the addition might be huge? We do modulo at the end of the inner loop? Actually, we can do modulo after each addition? But we do modulo after we have added all contributions for a state? Then we do modulo. Since the maximum value we can add in one digit is 13 * (previous dp_prev maximum) and the maximum dp_prev is MOD (about 1e9) then 13*1e9 is 13e9 which is less than 2^34, so we can do modulo at the end? But to be safe for the MOD arithmetic, we do modulo after adding all contributions? Actually, we do:\n\n   dp_curr(state) = dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre)\n\n   and then after the inner loop (over pre) we do modulo for each state? That's acceptable because the maximum number of pre states is 13, so the maximum added to dp_curr(state) is 13 * (max value in dp_prev). And max value in dp_prev is MOD (1e9+7) so 13*1e9+7 is about 13e9, which is less than 2^34? And 2^34 is about 17e9, so it's safe? But 13 * 1e9+7 is about 13e9, and 13e9 is less than 2^34 (which is 17,179,869,184). So we can do modulo at the end of the state.\n\nAlternatively, we can do modulo in the inner loop? But we do:\n\n   dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n  But then we are doing modulo at every addition? That's safe and might be better? Because the numbers don't get too big.\n\n  I'll change to:\n\n      do pre = 0, 12\n          state = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n          dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n      end do\n\n  But note: dp_curr(state) might be non-zero from a previous pre? So we have to do:\n\n      dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n  But then we are doing modulo at every step? It's acceptable.\n\n  However, note: the state index might be the same for different pre? So we are accumulating. But modulo at every step? It's inefficient? But 13 states, so 13*13=169 operations per digit? and the string is at most 6 digits? So it's acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      do pre = 0, 12\n          state = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n          dp_curr(state) = dp_curr(state) + dp_prev(pre)\n      end do\n      do state = 0, 12\n          dp_curr(state) = mod(dp_curr(state), MOD)\n      end do\n\n  Which is better? The first one does modulo 169 times? The second does 13 modulo operations? The second is more efficient? But both are acceptable for 6 digits.\n\n  I'll choose the second.\n\n  Also, note: the base update: base = mod(base * 10, 13) and base is an integer. We can do:\n\n      base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n  But note: if base*10 is negative? No, base is between 0 and 12, so base*10 is nonnegative.\n\n  Now, the third program: we use 8-byte integers for x, r, newNumber, factor, temp.\n\n  Also, note: the digit_list is stored in the order of extraction: the first extracted digit (the least significant) is stored first. Then we reconstruct by:\n\n      factor = 1\n      do i=1, ndigits\n          newNumber = newNumber + digit_list(i) * factor\n          factor = factor * 10\n      end do\n\n  But note: the digit_list(i) is the i-th extracted digit? and the first extracted is the least significant? Then we multiply by 1 (factor=1) for the first, then by 10 for the next? That means the first digit (i=1) becomes the least significant? and the last digit (i=ndigits) becomes the most significant? That is correct.\n\n  But what if the transformed digit is 9? Then it's 0? But we avoid that for the most significant? Only when we are at the last digit (x==0 after extraction) and 9-r==0, we leave it as r. So for example, if the number is 9, then we get r=9, and then we check: 9-9=0, and then we are at the last digit? Actually, when we extract 9, then x becomes 0 (because 9/10=0) so we are at the last digit. Then we cannot set it to 0? So we leave it as 9? Correct.\n\n  Example: 9 -> becomes 9? because 9-9=0 and we avoid leading zero? Then the number is 9.\n\n  But what about 19? \n      Step1: extract 9 -> becomes 0? (because 9-9=0, but then we are not at the last digit? because after extracting 9, x becomes 1 (then we extract 1). Then we set 9 to 0? Then the digits we store: first (least) is 0, then next we extract 1: then 9-1=8 which is less than 1? Actually, 9-1=8, which is greater than 1? So we leave 1 as 1? Then the new number is 10? Actually: \n          19: \n            first digit (least): 9 -> 0? (because 9-9=0, and it's not the last digit? so we set to 0) -> stored first.\n            then x=1, then we extract 1: \n                for 1: 9-1=8 which is greater than 1? Actually, 8>1? so we leave it as 1? \n            then the number is 1 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0 = 10.\n\n        But the expected transformation? We want to minimize the number? Actually, the problem says: transform each digit to either itself or 9-digit, whichever is smaller, but if 9-digit is 0 and it's the most significant then we leave as the digit.\n\n        Actually, the condition in the Java code:\n\n            if (9 - r < r) {\n                if (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) \n                    then use r\n                else\n                    use 9-r\n            } else {\n                use r\n            }\n\n        For 9: 9-9=0 < 9? true. Then if it's the last digit (x/10==0) and 9-9==0, then use r=9. So 9 remains 9.\n\n        For 19: \n            the last digit (least significant) is 9: 9-9=0 < 9 -> true. And then x/10 = 1 (which is not 0) so we use 0. Then the next digit (1): 9-1=8 which is less than 1? Actually, 8 is not less than 1? So we use 1? Then the number becomes 10.\n\n        But wait: 9-1=8, which is greater than 1? So we use 1? Then the number is 10.\n\n        Alternatively, we could change the condition? The condition is: if (9 - r < r). For r=1: 8<1? false. So we leave as 1.\n\n        So the transformation of 19 is 10.\n\n        But note: the transformation is applied per digit independently? and we are forming a new number? So 19 becomes 10? That's acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran code for the third program is as above.\n\n  Let's test the entire chain on a small input?\n\n  But the problem does not require testing, only translation.\n\n  We write the entire Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  Note: We assume the input for the first program is as expected: first integer n, then n strings of n characters.\n\n  We'll write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n  Important: In the first program, when we read the grid, we read n strings. We assume the strings are given one per line? Or they might be separated by space? The Java code uses sc.next() which reads tokens (separated by whitespace). So we can read the grid: each string is a token? So we read n tokens? In Fortran, we read each line? But the problem does not specify. We'll assume that the grid is given as n lines, each containing one string of n characters? Or the grid might be given as n tokens in one line? The Java code: \n\n        for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {\n            String s = sc.next();\n            arr.add(s);\n        }\n\n  So it reads tokens. The tokens could be in one line or multiple lines? But the next() method reads the next token. So we can read in Fortran: \n\n        do i=1, n\n            read(*,*) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n  This will read one token per read? So if the tokens are on separate lines, it works. If they are on one line, it will also work? Because the * format reads tokens.\n\n  We'll write accordingly.\n\n  Now, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  Note: We use integer(kind=8) for the variables that might be large? Specifically, for the second program's dp_prev and dp_curr, and for the third program's x, r, newNumber, factor, temp.\n\n  But note: the variable `fine` in the first program might be an integer? We used integer (4 bytes). But for n up to 100, the maximum fine is about 100^2*99 = 990000, which is within 4-byte integers.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  Let me write the code with detailed comments.\n\n  We assume Fortran 90 or later.\n\n  Code:"
