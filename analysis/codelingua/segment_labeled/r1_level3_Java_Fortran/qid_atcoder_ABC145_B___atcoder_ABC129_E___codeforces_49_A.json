Since M is 1000000007, and the numbers can be large, we do mod at every addition. We'll use:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M) , M) But we can also do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2 * dp(j-1,1), M) because mod(a+b, M) = mod(mod(a,M)+mod(b,M), M) and mod(2*dp(j-1,1), M) is mod(2 * mod(dp(j-1,1), M), M).

But 2*M = 2000000014, which is greater than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So we must avoid overflow. We can use 8-byte integers? Or do mod after multiplication. Let's use 8-byte integers for the dp array? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            temp = mod(2 * int(dp(j-1,1), int8), M)   ! but this is messy. Since the modulus is 1000000007, we can use 8-byte integers for the intermediate results. We'll declare:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp8(0:200,0:1)   ! and then at the end of each step mod by M to store in 4-byte? or we use 8-byte throughout? But the problem says M=1000000007, which fits in 4-byte? but intermediate results might be up to 3*M (which is about 3e9) and 3e9 is less than 2^32 (about 4e9) so 4-byte unsigned? but Fortran integers are signed. The maximum for 4-byte signed is 2147483647, which is less than 3000000000. Therefore, we must use 8-byte integers for the dp array to avoid overflow.

So we can do without mod in the multiplication? Then we can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        is safe. But note: in the '0' branch, we set:\n\n            dp(j,0) = dp(j-1,0) [which is already mod M8? but we are storing the mod value? Actually, we store the value mod M8?] Then we do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        which is the same as:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j-1,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )   -> because dp(j,1) was set to dp(j-1,1) = mod(3_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8) That is correct. Similarly, in the else branch: First: dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j-1,0)+dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n            Then: \n                dp(j,0) = mod( dp(j,0) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,0), M8 )   -> but note: initially, dp(j,0) is 0? So: dp(j,0) = mod( 0 + 2_8 * dp(j-1,0), M8 ) = mod(2 * dp(j-1,0), M8) Then: dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 ) \n                   = mod( (dp(j-1,0)+dp(j-1,1)) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n                   = mod( dp(j-1,0) + 3_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 ) But the Java code does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = 0 + (dp[i][0]*2) % M [but then mod]\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) % M + (dp[i][1]*2) % M   and then mod So it's the same. Therefore, we can write:\n\n        We'll use 8-byte integers for the dp array and for M8. We'll declare:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: M8 = 1000000007_8\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:200,0:1)   ! 0-indexed: 0..200, and 0:1\n            integer(kind=8) :: variable2 And then do the dp as above. One more issue: the string for the second program: s = result1, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so n2=3 for \"Yes\", or 2 for \"No\". We'll set:\n\n            s = result1   ! and then n2 = len_trim(s) But note: result1 is either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters). We don't have trailing space? So n2 = 3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\". Now, the third program: we write variable2 to s3. Then we process s3. The string s3 is the decimal representation of variable2.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC145_B) reads an integer `n` and then a string `str`. It checks if the string is formed by two same halves.\n    - It outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string (binary digits) and computes a dynamic programming problem modulo 1000000007.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_49_A) reads a string and checks the last non-space, non-question-mark character to see if it is a vowel (or 'y') and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is executed in order, with the output of one being the input of the next.\n\n The chain:\n   Input for the first program: \n        first integer n, then a string of length n (on the next line)\n   Output of the first program: either \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n   Then the second program takes the output of the first as its input? \n        But the second program expects a string of binary digits? However, the output of the first is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is not binary digits.\n\n Similarly, the third program expects a sentence.\n\n This does not seem to form a valid chain? Let me reexamine.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the three programs are independent? They read from standard input independently.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we must chain them: \n   The first program reads the initial input (an integer and a string on the next line).\n   Then its output (a string: \"Yes\" or \"No\") becomes the input to the second program.\n\n   The second program then takes that string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and processes it as a string of characters? \n        But the second program is designed for a string of binary digits? \n\n   Then the third program takes the output of the second (which is an integer modulo 1000000007? but the second program prints an integer) and then tries to read that integer as a string? \n\n This does not match.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire set of inputs is provided at the beginning? and then each program runs independently on the same initial input? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After reevaluating, it appears the example may be flawed? However, the problem states: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n Let me clarify the chain:\n\n Step 1: Run the first program with the initial input (n and then a string of n characters). It produces either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Step 2: The second program is run with the input being the output of the first, i.e., either the string \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n          The second program expects a string of binary digits? But \"Yes\" is not binary. This will cause the second program to behave in a way that is not intended.\n\n Step 3: Similarly, the third program would get the output of the second (which is an integer) as a string? \n\n This does not make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire input is provided at once? and then each program reads from the same input stream? \n\n But the first program reads an integer and a string. The second program reads a string. The third program reads a string. \n\n So the initial input must be:\n   <integer>\n   <string1>\n   <string2>\n   <string3>\n\n But then the chain would be:\n   Program1: reads the integer and the next line (string1) -> outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n   Program2: reads the next line of the input (which is string2) and ignores the previous output? \n   Program3: reads the next line (string3) and ignores the previous output?\n\n That is not chaining the output of the first to the input of the second.\n\n After reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the entire input to the chain is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first becomes the input to the second. The output of the second becomes the input to the third. The third produces the final output.\n\n Therefore, the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program: an integer n and a string of length n.\n\n Then the first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\". This string is the input to the second program.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) is designed for a string of binary digits? But we are giving it \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\n This will cause the second program to process:\n   s = \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n Then the second program does:\n   dp[0][0] = 1\n   for each character in s:\n        if char is '0' -> ... \n        else -> ...\n\n   But the string \"Yes\" has no '0'? So it will use the else branch for the first char 'Y' (which is not '0').\n\n   Then for the transition, when the char is not '0', it does:\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\n   Then the next part: since it's not '0', it does:\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n   Then for the next char (which is 'e') the same.\n\n   Then the second program outputs (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M, which is a number.\n\n   Then the third program takes that number (as a string? because it uses sc.nextLine())? But the output of the second is a number, so it would be a string of digits.\n\n   The third program then reads that string and checks the last non-space, non-question-mark character? \n\n   Since the string is a number (without any spaces or question marks), the last character is the last digit.\n\n   Then it checks if that last character (digit) is a vowel? or 'y'. \n\n   Vowels: 'a','e','i','o','u','y'. But note: the third program converts to lower case.\n\n   However, the string is a sequence of digits (like \"1234\"), and the last character is a digit. Digits are not vowels.\n\n   So the third program would output \"NO\".\n\n But this chain is not meaningful.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the programs are independent and run on the same initial input? \n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So we must design the Fortran program to:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (an integer n and then a string of length n).\n\n   Step 2: Run the first program's logic on that input, producing a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n   Step 3: Pass that string to the second program as its input.\n\n   Step 4: The second program runs on the string \"Yes\" or \"No\", producing an integer.\n\n   Step 5: Convert that integer to a string (because the third program reads a string) and pass it to the third program.\n\n   Step 6: The third program runs on that integer string and produces either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is the final output.\n\n However, note: the second program in Java reads the entire next line. So we are passing the string from step2 as the entire input to the second program.\n\n The third program also reads the entire next line, which is the output of the second program (the integer as a string).\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n   - Read the initial input: an integer n and a string of n characters (which we read as one line after the integer).\n\n   - Process the first program's logic: check if the string is equal to the concatenation of its first half with itself.\n\n   - Let variable1 = \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n   - Then use variable1 as the input string for the second program.\n\n   - The second program processes the string variable1 and computes a number (mod 1000000007). Let this be variable2.\n\n   - Convert variable2 to a string (without any extra spaces) to be the input for the third program.\n\n   - The third program processes that string: finds the last non-space, non-question-mark character and checks if it is a vowel (or 'y').\n\n   - Output the result (\"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We'll write one program that does:\n\n      program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        !

We know the length is n, but we read with A format so we get exactly the line.\n        ! But note: the input string might have trailing spaces? The Java program uses nextLine() so it includes the entire line including any trailing spaces? \n        ! However, the problem says the string is of length n.

But in Fortran, we read n and then the next line. We assume that the next line has at least n characters? \n\n        ! Extract the first n characters? Actually, the Java program uses charAt(i) for i from 0 to n/2-1.\n        ! We'll take the first n characters of the string we read.\n\n        ! Adjust: the string we read might have trailing newline? But Fortran read with '(A)' will remove the newline? \n        ! We know that the string has exactly n characters? So we can do:\n        len_str = len_trim(str)   ! But note: the problem says the string has length n. So we should use n.\n        ! However, the Java program uses the entire next line?

Then the second part: not '0'\n            dp(j,0) = mod(dp(j,0) + mod(dp(j-1,0) * 2, M), M)\n            dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1) + mod(dp(j-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n        end if\n\n However, note that in the else branch for the first part we set dp(j,1) to a new value. Then in the second part we add more. \n But in the Java code, the second part for the else branch is:\n\n        else {\n            dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n            dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n        }\n\n And note that the first part already set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M. Then we add (dp[i][0]*2 and dp[i][1]*2) mod M.\n\n So in Fortran, for the else branch we have:\n\n        dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j-1,0) + dp(j-1,1), M)   ! This sets dp(j,1) to a value, but note: initially dp(j,0) and dp(j,1) are 0? \n        ! Then we add to dp(j,0) and dp(j,1) the doubled values.\n\n        dp(j,0) = mod(dp(j,0) + mod(dp(j-1,0) * 2, M), M)\n        dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1) + mod(dp(j-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n\n But note: in the first part of the else branch, we set dp(j,1) to a value, but we did not set dp(j,0) at all? \n\n However, in the Java code, for the else branch of the first part, we only set dp[i+1][1]. Then in the second part we add to both.\n\n So in Fortran, we must do:\n\n        else\n            ! First part: \n            dp(j,0) = 0   ? Actually, we don't set dp(j,0) in the first part? Then we add to it in the second part? \n            ! But the Java code: \n            !   The first part: only sets [1] and leaves [0] unset? Actually, no: the Java code only sets [1] in the first part? and then in the second part we add to [0] and [1]. \n            !   But the dp array for the new index is initially zero? \n\n            ! So in Fortran, we start with dp(j,0)=0 and dp(j,1)=0.\n\n            ! First part: \n            dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j-1,0) + dp(j-1,1), M)\n            ! Second part: \n            dp(j,0) = mod(dp(j,0) + mod(dp(j-1,0) * 2, M), M)\n            dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1) + mod(dp(j-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n\n        end if\n\n But wait: the Java code for the second part in the else branch does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n So we are adding to the current state.\n\n However, we just set dp(j,1) in the first part. Then we add to it.\n\n Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n But for the '0' branch:\n\n        First part: \n            dp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0]\n            dp[j][1] = dp[j-1][1]\n        Then second part: \n            dp[j][1] += (dp[j-1][1] * 2) % M\n\n        So in Fortran:\n\n            dp(j,0) = dp(j-1,0)\n            dp(j,1) = dp(j-1,1)\n            dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1) + mod(dp(j-1,1) * 2, M), M)\n\n        But note: the second part uses dp[j-1][1] again? \n\n        However, we have already set dp(j,1) to dp(j-1,1). Then we add dp(j-1,1)*2.\n\n        So total for state1: dp(j-1,1) + 2 * dp(j-1,1) = 3 * dp(j-1,1)\n\n        But in the Java code: \n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M   -> so 3 * dp[i][1] mod M.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n However, note: the Java code for the '0' branch in the second part:\n\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        So they are using the current value of dp[i+1][1] (which was set to dp[i][1]) and then add 2 * dp[i][1]. \n\n        So we do: \n            dp(j,1) = dp(j,1) + mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n            then mod.\n\n        But note: we must do mod at each step to avoid overflow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M) , M)\n\n        But we can also do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n\n        However, if we do mod at the end, we must be cautious of the intermediate values.\n\n        Since M is 1000000007, and the numbers can be large, we do mod at every addition.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M) , M)\n\n        But we can also do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n\n        because mod(a+b, M) = mod(mod(a,M)+mod(b,M), M) and mod(2*dp(j-1,1), M) is mod(2 * mod(dp(j-1,1), M), M). \n\n        But we are already storing dp(j-1,1) mod M? Not exactly: we did mod in the previous step? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n\n        However, the product 2 * dp(j-1,1) might be huge? So we do:\n\n            temp = mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + temp, M)\n\n        But for simplicity and to avoid overflow, we do mod after each multiplication and then after addition.\n\n        But Fortran integers are 4-byte? M is 1000000007, so 2*dp(j-1,1) might be up to 2*M, which is about 2e9 -> which is within the range of 4-byte integer (if signed, max is about 2e9). But 2*M = 2000000014, which is greater than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So we must avoid overflow.\n\n        We can use 8-byte integers? Or do mod after multiplication.\n\n        Let's use 8-byte integers for the dp array? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            temp = mod(2 * int(dp(j-1,1), int8), M)   ! but this is messy.\n\n        Since the modulus is 1000000007, we can use 8-byte integers for the intermediate results.\n\n        We'll declare:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp8(0:200,0:1)   ! and then at the end of each step mod by M to store in 4-byte? or we use 8-byte throughout? \n\n        But the problem says M=1000000007, which fits in 4-byte? but intermediate results might be up to 3*M (which is about 3e9) and 3e9 is less than 2^32 (about 4e9) so 4-byte unsigned? but Fortran integers are signed. The maximum for 4-byte signed is 2147483647, which is less than 3000000000.\n\n        Therefore, we must use 8-byte integers for the dp array to avoid overflow.\n\n        We'll change:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:200,0:1)\n            integer(kind=8) :: M8 = 1000000007_8\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            dp(j,0) = ... mod(..., M8)\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 4-byte and do mod at every step? but then we have to break the multiplication:\n\n            mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M) might be computed as: \n               temp = mod(dp(j-1,1), M)\n               mod(2 * temp, M)\n\n        But note: dp(j-1,1) might be in the range [0, M-1] so we can do:\n\n            mod(2 * dp(j-1,1), M)\n\n        without overflow? Because 2*(M-1) = 2000000012, which is less than 2147483647? \n            M = 1000000007 -> 2*M = 2000000014, which is greater than 2^31-1 (2147483647) -> so 2 * (M-1) = 2000000012, which is greater than 2147483647 -> overflow.\n\n        Therefore, we must use 8-byte integers for the dp array and for the intermediate multiplications.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007   ! but we'll use 8-byte constant for modulus\n          integer(kind=8) :: M8 = 1000000007_8\n          integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:200,0:1)\n\n        Then do mod with M8.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: mod8 = 1000000007_8\n\n        But the problem says M=1000000007, so we'll use 8-byte modulus.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), mod8)\n\n        However, we must be cautious: all operations should be in 8-byte.\n\n        We'll change the dp array to 8-byte and the modulus to 8-byte.\n\n        Also, the variable2 must be 8-byte? But then we write to string: that's fine.\n\n        Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the initial dp(0,0)=1 -> we can assign as 1_8.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 4-byte if we break the operations? but it's safer to use 8-byte.\n\n        Given the constraints (string length up to 200, modulus 1000000007) and the multiplications by 2 and 3, we need 8-byte.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: M8 = 1000000007_8\n\n        and then use mod with M8.\n\n        Also, the variable2: integer(kind=8) and then write to string.\n\n        But note: the third program expects a string of digits. The number can be up to (at most) 2 * M8? Then the string length is at most 10 digits.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            write(s3, '(I0)') variable2   ! I0 for integer of kind=8? \n\n        But Fortran: if variable2 is integer(kind=8), then we use I0 and it will work? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            character(len=20) :: s3   ! 20 characters enough for integer up to 10^18\n\n        and then:\n\n            write(s3, *) variable2   ! but this may have leading spaces? \n            s3 = adjustl(s3)   ! to remove leading spaces? but the Java program reads the entire line including spaces? \n\n        But the third program skips spaces at the end? Actually, it goes backwards and the first non-space, non-question mark is the last character of the number? \n\n        However, the string we write with '(I0)' has no leading spaces. So we can use:\n\n            write(s3, '(I0)') variable2\n\n        But variable2 is 8-byte. We must use I0 for 8-byte? Actually, in Fortran, if we use '(I0)' for an 8-byte integer, it works? \n\n        Yes, in modern Fortran.\n\n        Now, the Fortran code:\n\n        We'll use 8-byte integers for the dp array and for M8.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          M8 = 1000000007_8\n\n          dp(0,0) = 1_8\n          dp(0,1) = 0_8\n\n          do j = 1, n2\n            if (s(j:j) == '0') then\n                dp(j,0) = dp(j-1,0)\n                dp(j,1) = dp(j-1,1)\n                ! Then the second part for '0'\n                dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n                ! Then mod?\n                dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1), M8)\n            else\n                ! First part: not '0'\n                dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j-1,0) + dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n                ! Second part: not '0'\n                dp(j,0) = mod( dp(j,0) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,0), M8 )\n                dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n                ! Then mod? Actually, we did mod at each step? \n                ! But we can do mod at the end of each line? \n                dp(j,0) = mod(dp(j,0), M8)\n                dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1), M8)\n            end if\n          end do\n\n          variable2 = mod( dp(n2,0) + dp(n2,1), M8 )\n\n        However, in the '0' branch, we did:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        and then mod again? Actually, the mod function in the expression does the mod. So we don't need the next mod? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        and then we don't need the next mod? \n\n        Similarly, in the else branch, we do mod at the assignment.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1)\n            dp(j,1) = mod(dp(j,1), M8)\n\n        But the first way is safe.\n\n        However, the multiplication by 2 might cause overflow in the intermediate step? But we are using 8-byte and M8 is about 1e9, so 2 * dp(j-1,1) is at most 2e9, which is less than 2^63-1. So we can do without mod in the multiplication? \n\n        Then we can do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        is safe.\n\n        But note: in the '0' branch, we set:\n\n            dp(j,0) = dp(j-1,0)   [which is already mod M8? but we are storing the mod value? Actually, we store the value mod M8?]\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        which is the same as:\n\n            dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j-1,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )   -> because dp(j,1) was set to dp(j-1,1)\n\n        = mod(3_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8)\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Similarly, in the else branch:\n\n            First: dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j-1,0)+dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n            Then: \n                dp(j,0) = mod( dp(j,0) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,0), M8 )   -> but note: initially, dp(j,0) is 0? \n                So: dp(j,0) = mod( 0 + 2_8 * dp(j-1,0), M8 ) = mod(2 * dp(j-1,0), M8)\n            Then: dp(j,1) = mod( dp(j,1) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 ) \n                   = mod( (dp(j-1,0)+dp(j-1,1)) + 2_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n                   = mod( dp(j-1,0) + 3_8 * dp(j-1,1), M8 )\n\n        But the Java code does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = 0 + (dp[i][0]*2) % M   [but then mod]\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) % M + (dp[i][1]*2) % M   and then mod\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        We'll use 8-byte integers for the dp array and for M8.\n\n        We'll declare:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: M8 = 1000000007_8\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:200,0:1)   ! 0-indexed: 0..200, and 0:1\n            integer(kind=8) :: variable2\n\n        And then do the dp as above.\n\n        One more issue: the string for the second program: s = result1, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so n2=3 for \"Yes\", or 2 for \"No\".\n\n        We'll set:\n\n            s = result1   ! and then n2 = len_trim(s)\n\n        But note: result1 is either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters). We don't have trailing space? \n\n        So n2 = 3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\".\n\n        Now, the third program: we write variable2 to s3. Then we process s3.\n\n        The string s3 is the decimal representation of variable2.\n\n        We then find the last non-space, non-question-mark character? But the string s3 has no spaces? So we take the last character.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java:\n\n            for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n                    ch = s.charAt(i);\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n        So if there are trailing spaces or question marks, we skip them. But our string s3 is just digits, no spaces. So we take the last character.\n\n        Then we check if that character is a vowel? \n\n        Vowels: 'a','e','i','o','u','y'. But note: we are using digits. The last character is a digit. \n\n        So the third program will always output \"NO\", because no digit is a vowel.\n\n        However, let's test with the chain:\n\n          First program: \n             Input: n=4, string=\"ABAB\" -> not \"ABAB\" = \"AB\"+\"AB\" -> so output \"No\"\n\n          Then second program: \n             Input: \"No\" (string of length 2)\n                 j=1: char 'N' -> not '0'\n                    dp(1,1) = mod( dp(0,0)+dp(0,1), M8) = 1+0 = 1\n                    dp(1,0) = mod(0 + 2*dp(0,0), M8) = 2\n                    dp(1,1) = mod(1 + 2*dp(0,1), M8) = 1 -> then mod both: dp(1,0)=2, dp(1,1)=1\n                 j=2: char 'o' -> not '0'\n                    dp(2,1) = mod( dp(1,0)+dp(1,1), M8) = 2+1=3\n                    dp(2,0) = mod(0 + 2*dp(1,0), M8) = 4\n                    dp(2,1) = mod(3 + 2*dp(1,1), M8) = 3+2=5 -> then mod: 4 and 5.\n\n                 variable2 = mod(4+5, M8) = 9\n\n          Then third program: \n             Input: \"9\" -> the last non-space, non-question-mark is '9'. \n             Convert to lowercase: still '9'. \n             Check: is it a vowel? -> no -> output \"NO\"\n\n        So the chain produces \"NO\".\n\n        But if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then:\n\n          s = \"Yes\" (3 characters)\n\n          j=1: 'Y' -> not '0'\n             dp(1,1)=1 (from dp0:0+1=1)\n             dp(1,0)=2\n             dp(1,1)=1+0=1? then becomes 1? Actually: \n                 dp(1,0)=0 + 2*1=2\n                 dp(1,1)=1 + 2*0=1\n          j=2: 'e' -> not '0'\n                 dp(2,1)= mod( dp(1,0)+dp(1,1), M8) = 2+1=3\n                 dp(2,0)= mod(0+2*dp(1,0), M8)=4\n                 dp(2,1)= mod(3+2*dp(1,1), M8)=3+2=5\n          j=3: 's' -> not '0'\n                 dp(3,1)= mod(4+5, M8)=9\n                 dp(3,0)= mod(0+2*4, M8)=8\n                 dp(3,1)= mod(9+2*5, M8)=9+10=19\n          variable2 = mod(8+19, M8)=27\n\n          Then third program: last character of \"27\" is '7' -> not vowel -> \"NO\"\n\n        So regardless, the third program outputs \"NO\".\n\n        But this is the chain.\n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the first program might have a bug? The Java program:\n\n            if (str.equals(a + a)) cout(\"Yes\");\n\n        But note: the string a is the first n/2 characters. Then a+a has length n. And we are comparing to the entire string (which has length n). So it's correct.\n\n        But in Fortran, we did:\n\n            a = str(1:half)\n            if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n\n        This is correct if the string str has exactly n characters? \n\n        How did we read the string? \n\n            read(*,'(A)') str   ! This reads the entire line, which might have more than n characters? \n\n        But the problem says the string has length n. So we assume that the next line has exactly n characters? \n\n        But if the next line has more than n, then we are comparing the first n characters of the read string to a+a? \n\n        Actually, the Java program: \n\n            str = cin.nextLine();\n\n        and then it uses the entire string? But the problem says the string is of length n.\n\n        So we can assume the input string has exactly n characters? \n\n        Therefore, we can take the substring of the read string to the first n characters? \n\n        How? We read the entire line, but we know n. So we can do:\n\n            if (len_trim(str) > n) then\n                ! We take the first n characters? \n                temp_str = str(1:n)\n            else\n                temp_str = str\n            end if\n\n        But the problem says the string has length n. So we can simply use:\n\n            a = temp_str(1:half)\n            if (temp_str == a // a) then\n\n        But what if the string we read has less than n characters? Then we pad with spaces? \n\n        The Java program: if the nextLine() returns a string of length less than n? Then the for loop would run for n/2, but we might get an exception? \n\n        So we assume the input is valid.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            ! We know n, so we take the first n characters of the read string? \n            ! But if the read string has less than n, we pad with spaces? \n            ! The problem says the string has length n.\n\n            if (len(str) < n) then\n                ! This should not happen? \n                ! We take the entire string and pad with spaces to n?\n                temp_str = str\n                do i = len(str)+1, n\n                    temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n                end do\n            else\n                temp_str = str(1:n)\n            end if\n\n        But the Java program uses the entire next line. And if the next line has less than n, then the rest is not there? \n\n        Actually, the Java program: \n\n            str = cin.nextLine();\n\n        and then it uses str.charAt(i) for i from 0 to n/2-1. So if n is 4 and the string is \"AB\" (only 2 characters), then when i=0,1 we get the two characters, but then we form a+a = \"ABAB\", and compare to the entire string \"AB\", which is not equal.\n\n        So we don't need to pad: we can use the entire string we read and then compare to a+a? But note: the entire string we read might have length < n? \n\n        The problem says: the string is of length n. So we assume the read string has exactly n characters.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply:\n\n            a = str(1:half)   ! but if the string we read has less than half characters? \n\n        We'll assume the input is as described.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            if (len_trim(str) < n) then\n                ! We take the entire string and then form a from the first min(half, len_trim(str)) characters? \n                ! But the problem says n, so we assume the string has at least n characters? \n            end if\n\n        Since the problem states the input format, we assume the next line has at least n characters? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            temp_str = str(1:n)\n\n        Then use that.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Note: we must declare variables appropriately.\n\n        We'll assume:\n\n            character(len=200) :: str, temp_str, a, s, s3\n            integer :: n, half, i, j, n2, length, last_index\n            character :: ch\n            character(len=3) :: result1, result3\n\n        For the dp array: we use 8-byte and up to 200.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the first program: we are reading n and then a string. The string we read may have more than 200 characters? \n\n        We'll assume the maximum length is 200.\n\n        We'll declare:\n\n            character(len=300) :: input_line   ! for reading the string, to be safe\n\n        But we read with:\n\n            read(*,*) n   ! reads the integer\n            read(*,'(A)') str   ! reads the next line\n\n        And then we take the first n characters? \n\n        We'll set:\n\n            if (n > 200) then\n                write(*,*) \"n is too large\"\n                stop\n            end if\n\n        Then:\n\n            temp_str = str(1:n)\n\n        But if the string we read has less than n, then we pad? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            temp_str = \"\"\n            if (len_trim(str) < n) then\n                temp_str = str\n                do i = len_trim(str)+1, n\n                    temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n                end do\n            else\n                temp_str = str(1:n)\n            end if\n\n        But the problem says the string has length n. So we'll assume it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read exactly n characters:\n\n            read(*,'(A)') str   ! but this reads the whole line, which might be more than n? \n\n        We can read with:\n\n            read(*,'(A)') str   ! read the entire line\n            ! then take the first n characters\n\n        So:\n\n            temp_str = str(1:n)\n\n        But if n is greater than the length of str, we get an error? \n\n        We can avoid by:\n\n            temp_str = str\n            if (len(temp_str) < n) then\n                ! pad to n\n                temp_str = trim(temp_str)\n                do i = len_trim(temp_str)+1, n\n                    temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n                end do\n            else\n                temp_str = str(1:n)\n            end if\n\n        But to be safe, we'll do that.\n\n        However, the problem says the string has length n. So we assume the input is correct.\n\n        We'll simply use:\n\n            a = str(1:half)\n            if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n\n        But if the string we read has length < n, then str(1:n) would be undefined for the positions beyond the length of the string? \n\n        We'll pad the string to n characters with spaces.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            ! After reading str, we create a string of n characters by taking the first n characters, padding with spaces if necessary.\n            character(len=200) :: padded_str\n            padded_str = ' '   ! initialize with spaces\n            if (len_trim(str) > 0) then\n                padded_str(1:min(n, len_trim(str))) = str(1:min(n, len_trim(str)))\n            end if\n\n        But the problem says the string has length n, so we assume we read at least n characters? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            padded_str = str(1:min(n, len(str)))   ! but we want exactly n characters? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            padded_str = str\n            if (len(padded_str) < n) then\n                padded_str = padded_str // repeat(' ', n - len(padded_str))\n            else\n                padded_str = padded_str(1:n)\n            end if\n\n        But Fortran: the assignment padded_str = str may truncate if str is longer than padded_str? \n\n        We are using character(len=200) for str and padded_str. \n\n        Actually, we read the string into str which is 200 characters. Then we create padded_str of length 200? \n\n        But we only care about the first n.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            ! We'll form a string of length n: take the first min(n,200) characters of str, and then pad to n if necessary? \n            ! But n is at most 200? we already checked.\n\n        So:\n\n            padded_str = ' '\n            if (n <= 200) then\n                padded_str(1:n) = str(1:n)\n            else\n                ! n>200 -> we already checked and stopped.\n            end if\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            if (n>200) then ... stop\n\n        Then:\n\n            padded_str = str(1:n)   ! because n<=200 and str is 200 long -> we can do this? \n\n        But if the actual string we read is shorter than n? then we get an error? \n\n        We'll use:\n\n            if (len_trim(str) < n) then\n                padded_str(1:len_trim(str)) = str(1:len_trim(str))\n                ! the rest is space by initialization\n            else\n                padded_str(1:n) = str(1:n)\n            end if\n\n        But we don't need to, because the problem says the string has length n.\n\n        We'll assume the input is correct.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        We'll write the program with 8-byte for dp, and padding for the string to n characters only if necessary? but we assume n is the length and the string has exactly n characters.\n\n        We'll not pad.\n\n        But we do: \n\n            read(*,*) n\n            read(*,'(A)') str\n\n            if (n>200) then\n                write(*,*) \"n is too large, max 200\"\n                stop\n            end if\n\n            ! Extract the first n characters of str? \n            ! If the string we read has less than n, then we take what we have and then the rest is undefined? But the problem says the string has length n.\n\n            half = n/2\n            a = str(1:half)\n\n            if (n <= len_trim(str)) then\n                if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n                    result1 = \"Yes\"\n                else\n                    result1 = \"No\"\n                end if\n            else\n                ! The string we read has less than n characters? \n                if (str == a(1:len_trim(str))) then  ? \n                Actually, we cannot form a+a because it would be of length 2*half, which is n. But we don't have n characters? \n\n                So we compare the entire string to a // a? but a // a has length n, and our str has length < n -> not equal.\n\n                result1 = \"No\"\n            end if\n\n        But again, the problem says the string has length n. So we skip.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            if (n > len(str)) then\n                result1 = \"No\"\n            else\n                if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n                    result1 = \"Yes\"\n                else\n                    result1 = \"No\"\n                end if\n            end if\n\n        But len(str) is the declared length? 200. So we always have n<=200 (because we checked) and then we can use:\n\n            a = str(1:half)\n            if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n\n        But note: str(1:n) is a substring of str from index1 to n.\n\n        And a // a is a string of length n? because a is half, and half = n/2, so n is even? \n\n        The first program: it only runs the loop for i from 0 to n/2-1, so n must be even? \n\n        The Java program: \n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) \n\n        So if n is odd, then n/2 is integer division? In Java, integer division truncates. Then the first half is the first floor(n/2) characters? \n\n        And then a+a has length 2 * floor(n/2) which is less than n? \n\n        Then the string will never be equal to a+a? \n\n        Example: n=5, then we take the first 2 characters (because 5/2=2). Then a+a is 4 characters. Then we compare to the entire string of 5 characters -> not equal.\n\n        So the first program only outputs \"Yes\" if n is even? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (mod(n,2) /= 0) then\n                result1 = \"No\"\n            else\n                half = n/2\n                a = str(1:half)\n                if (str(1:n) == a // a) then\n                    result1 = \"Yes\"\n                else\n                    result1 = \"No\"\n                end if\n            end if\n\n        This matches the Java program.\n\n        Now, we code accordingly.\n\n        Let's write the final Fortran code.\n\n        Note: we must be careful with the dp array indexing: we use j from 1 to n2.\n\n        We'll assume:\n\n            dp(0,0:1) -> index 0\n            dp(1,0:1) -> index 1, ... up to n2.\n\n        And the string s has length n2, and we index from 1 to n2.\n\n        We do:\n\n            do j = 1, n2\n                ... s(j:j) ...\n\n        And we use dp(j,0) for the state at j.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        We'll put it all together.\n\n        IMPORTANT: the second program uses the entire string (including any trailing spaces? no, because we set s = trim(result1)? \n\n        But result1 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which have no trailing spaces? \n\n        So we can set:\n\n            s = result1\n            n2 = len_trim(s)\n\n        But result1 is exactly \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we can set n2 = 3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\". \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            n2 = len(result1)   ! which is 3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\"? \n\n        But we declared result1 as character(len=3), so len(result1)=3. But if result1 is \"No\", then it is \"No \"? with a space at the end? \n\n        We did:\n\n            if ... then\n                result1 = \"Yes\"\n            else\n                result1 = \"No\"\n\n        But \"No\" is two characters, but we assigned to a variable of length 3 -> so it becomes \"No \" (with a trailing space).\n\n        Then when we do s = result1, we get \"Yes \" or \"No \"? \n\n        Then n2 = len_trim(s) would be 3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\". \n\n        But in the second program, we want to process only the non-space part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n\n            s = trim(result1)\n\n        Then n2 = len_trim(s)\n\n        We'll do that.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Note: The entire program is in one file.\n\n        Let's write it."
