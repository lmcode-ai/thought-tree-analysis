It only does moves for 'L','R','U','D'. Our string str1 is composed of digits, so there will be no moves. Therefore, the entire path is (0,0) for all points. Then the collision check: \n            We have at least 4 points (if len_str1>=3) and all are (0,0). For i=0 and j=3: \n                dx = 0, dy=0 -> then (dx<=1 and dy==0) -> true -> so flag becomes false. Therefore, we will always set input3 = \"BUG\", unless the string has length less than 4? For example, if max_value is 0, then the string is \"0\" -> len_str1=1 -> then the points are [0,0] at step0 and step1. Then the loop for i from 0 to len_str1-3 = 1-3 = -2 -> so the loop is not entered -> flag remains .true. -> then input3=\"OK\". But note: the condition in the second program's loop: \n            for (i = 0; i < k - 3; ++i) [k = len_str1+1, because k starts at 1 and then increments for each character?] Actually, in the Java program:\n\n            k = 0 initially. co[0][k] = x0, co[1][k] = y0; then k++ -> k=1. Then for each character, we update x,y, then set co[0][k]=x, co[1][k]=y, then k++. So at the end, k = len_str1+1. Then the loop: i from 0 to k-3-1? because condition i < k-3 -> i from 0 to k-4. So if k-3 is the upper bound? In our case, k = len_str1+1, so the loop is i from 0 to (len_str1+1-3-1) = len_str1-3? But note: the condition is i < k-3 -> so i from 0 to k-4. We have k points: indices 0 to k-1.",

The Java loop: i from 0 to k-4 (inclusive) and j from i+3 to k-1? Our condition: j goes to len_str1, which is k-1 -> same. So if the number of points is k, then we do:\n\n                i: 0 to k-4\n                j: i+3 to k-1\n\n            This is the same. Therefore, if the string has length 1, then k=2 (points: index0 and index1). Then the loop is i from 0 to 2-4 = -2 -> not entered -> flag remains .true. -> \"OK\". But if the string has length 3, then k=4, then i from 0 to 4-4=0? -> i=0, then j from 3 to 3 (the last point).

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The input for the entire chain is the input of the first program (atcoder_ABC145_E), and the output of the entire chain is the output of the last program (codeforces_32_B).\n However, note that the three programs are independent and meant to be run in sequence. The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC145_E) reads:\n      N T\n      then N pairs of integers (A_i, B_i)\n\n    and outputs a single integer.\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_8_B) reads a string.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_32_B) reads a string.\n\n Therefore, the output of the first program (an integer) must be converted to a string to become the input of the second program?\n However, the second program expects a string of characters (which are 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D') and the third also expects a string (which is a sequence of '.' and '-').\n\n This suggests that the programs are not meant to be chained by the output of the first being the input of the second? \n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How can we chain them?\n\n Let's reexamine:\n\n Program 1: Input is integers, output is an integer.\n Program 2: Input is a string (from the first token of the input? but the example input for program2 is a string of moves).\n Program 3: Input is a string (which is a sequence of '.' and '-').\n\n So the chain would be:\n\n   Input for program1 -> Output of program1 (an integer) -> becomes the input for program2? But program2 expects a string of moves.\n\n This does not match.\n\n Therefore, we must consider that the entire set of input for the chain is the input for the first program, and then the output of the first program is the input for the second, and so on.\n\n But the inputs for the three programs are different.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that we are to run the three programs independently on the same initial input? \n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How to resolve?\n\n After reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So:\n\n   - The entire input is read at the beginning (by the first block).\n   - Then we process the first program's logic and get its output (which is an integer) but we don't print it. Instead, we pass it as input to the second program? \n     But the second program expects a string.\n\n This is a problem.\n\n Alternatively, the chain might be:\n\n   Input for the chain = input for program1.\n   Then the output of program1 (an integer) is converted to a string and that string becomes the input for program2?\n   Then the output of program2 (which is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") becomes the input for program3?\n\n But program3 expects a string of '.' and '-'. \n\n This doesn't match.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider the intended chain. It is more likely that the three programs are independent and the chain is over three different inputs? \n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After reading the examples, it seems that the three programs are from different problems and are not designed to be chained. \n\n However, the problem requires us to chain them. So we must design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N, T, and the array AB of N pairs).\n   Step 2: Run the first program and capture its output (an integer, say `res1`).\n   Step 3: Convert `res1` to a string? But the second program expects a string of moves (like \"LRUD\"). \n\n How can we use `res1` as the input string for the second program? It doesn't make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the entire input file contains:\n\n   First, the data for program1 (N, T, and the pairs)\n   Then, the data for program2 (a string)\n   Then, the data for program3 (a string)\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we must assume that the input to the entire Fortran program is only the input for the first program? \n\n And then the output of the first program becomes the input for the second, and the output of the second becomes the input for the third.\n\n But the second program expects a string of characters (which are commands). How can the integer output of the first program be converted to such a string?\n\n We must reinterpret the problem: the three programs are independent and the chain is not by data but by the fact that we are to run them sequentially on separate inputs that are all provided at the start? \n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n After careful thought, I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem likely means that we are to simulate the three programs in sequence, but each program has its own input which is the output of the previous one. \n\n But then the entire input for the chain is just the input for the first program? \n\n How about the input for the second and third? They are the outputs of the previous program.\n\n Therefore:\n\n   Input for the chain: the input for the first program (N, T, and the pairs)\n   Then, the first program produces an integer -> that integer is the entire input for the second program? \n        But the second program expects a string. So we must convert the integer to a string.\n\n   Then, the second program reads that string and produces either \"OK\" or \"BUG\" -> that string becomes the input for the third program? \n        The third program expects a string of '.' and '-'. But \"OK\" is two characters: 'O' and 'K'. \n\n This does not match the expected input of the third program.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the chain is over three separate runs, but the problem states \"a single Fortran program\".\n\n How to resolve? \n\n I think we must stick to the requirement: \n   - Only the first block reads the entire input (which includes the inputs for all three programs?).\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", meaning that the input for the second program is the output of the first, and the input for the third is the output of the second.\n\n Therefore, the entire input that the Fortran program reads is only the input for the first program.\n\n Then:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N, T, and the array AB).\n   Step 2: Run the first program and get an integer result (res1).\n   Step 3: Convert res1 to a string (say, using internal write) and use that string as the input for the second program.\n   Step 4: Run the second program on the string representation of res1 and get its output (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", but note the second program outputs one of these two strings).\n   Step 5: Use the output string of the second program as the input for the third program.\n   Step 6: Run the third program on that string and produce the final output.\n\n However, the second program (codeforces_8_B) is designed for a string of moves. It will break if we give it a string of digits? \n And the third program (codeforces_32_B) expects a string of '.' and '-' (or actually, the example input for the third program is a string of '.' and '-').\n\n But the second program outputs either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", which are not composed of '.' and '-'. \n\n So the third program will not work.\n\n This indicates that the three programs are not intended to be chained by their outputs and inputs? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are run independently on the same initial input? \n\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n I think we have to assume that the entire input file has the data for all three programs? \n\n But the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\"\n\n So we read everything at the beginning.\n\n How about:\n\n   The entire input is structured as:\n\n      [Input for program1]\n      [Input for program2]   (on the next line? or after the last number of program1? but program1 reads until N pairs, then program2 reads a string)\n      [Input for program3]   (on the next line?)\n\n But then the chain is:\n\n      Program1 runs on its part and produces output -> which is ignored? \n      Instead, the input for program2 is read from the input file, not from the output of program1.\n\n This contradicts the requirement.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So we must design:\n\n   The Fortran program reads the input for the first program only.\n\n   Then:\n\n        output1 = run_program1(input)\n        output2 = run_program2(output1)\n        output3 = run_program3(output2)\n\n   And then output output3.\n\n But then we have to convert the output of program1 (an integer) to a string for program2, and the output of program2 (a string) to the input for program3.\n\n However, program2 and program3 are designed for specific string formats that are not the integer string.\n\n This will not work.\n\n Given the confusion, let's look at the actual programs:\n\n   Program1: atcoder_ABC145_E - it is a knapsack-like problem.\n   Program2: codeforces_8_B - it is a path checking problem (with moves in 2D).\n   Program3: codeforces_32_B - it is a ternary? number system decoder.\n\n They are completely unrelated.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the problem intended for us to run the three programs independently on three separate inputs that are provided in one go. \n\n But then the requirement \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\" is not satisfied.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have provided the wrong set of programs.\n\n Given the instructions, we must chain them as:\n\n   Input for the chain = input for program1.\n\n   Then:\n\n        output1 = program1(input_chain)\n        output2 = program2( string_of(output1) )   // convert integer to string\n        output3 = program3(output2)                // output2 is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\"\n\n   But program3 expects a string of '.' and '-'. If we pass \"OK\", then:\n\n        '.' -> outputs 0 if not preceded by anything, or if preceded by a non-'.' then it might be different.\n\n   Specifically, for \"OK\":\n\n        O is not '.' or '-' -> so it will be treated as if it were '-'? But the program only has two cases: '.' and other (which is '-').\n\n        The code of program3:\n\n            if (n[i] == '.') {\n                if (s) {   // s is a boolean that is set to true when we see a '-' (or any non-'.') and then reset after printing 1 or 2\n                    print 1\n                    s = false\n                } else {\n                    print 0\n                }\n            } else {\n                if (s) {\n                    print 2\n                    s = false\n                } else {\n                    s = true\n                }\n            }\n\n        For the string \"OK\":\n\n          O: not '.' -> then we are in the else branch.\n            s is initially false -> so we set s to true and print nothing.\n\n          K: not '.' -> then in the else branch, and now s is true -> we print 2 and set s to false.\n\n        So the output would be \"2\".\n\n   But this is not meaningful.\n\n Given the above, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement or the example programs.\n\n However, we must produce a Fortran program that does the following:\n\n   1. Read the input for the first program (N, T, and then N pairs of integers).\n   2. Run the first program's logic and capture its output (an integer).\n   3. Convert that integer to a string (say, by writing it to a character variable).\n   4. Run the second program's logic on that string. The second program's logic is to simulate moves and then check for collisions in the path. It outputs either \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n   5. Take the string output of the second program (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") and use it as the input for the third program.\n   6. Run the third program's logic on that string and produce a string output (which will be a sequence of '0','1','2').\n\n   7. Then output the result of the third program.\n\n But note: the third program does not output a string with newlines, it just prints digits. So the final output is that digit string.\n\n However, this is unlikely to be meaningful, but it satisfies the requirement of chaining.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read N and T, and then N pairs of integers.\n\n   Step 2: Implement the first program's logic (knapsack) to compute an integer result (max_value).\n\n   Step 3: Convert max_value to a string. We have to be cautious: the second program expects a string of 'L','R','U','D'. \n            But our integer string will be digits. How will the second program interpret digits?\n\n        The second program:\n\n            It reads a string and then for each character:\n\n                'L' -> x--\n                'R' -> x++\n                'U' -> y++\n                'D' -> y--\n\n            Then it records the coordinates at each step.\n\n            Then it checks for collisions: it looks for two points that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) and at least 3 steps apart in time.\n\n        If we give it a string of digits, then it will try to interpret each digit as a move command. For example, '1' is not one of the commands, so it will do nothing? \n        Actually, the switch statement will not match, so the coordinates will remain unchanged for that step.\n\n        This means the entire path will be (0,0) repeated for the length of the string.\n\n        Then the collision check: \n            The points are all (0,0). So for any i and j (with j>=i+3), the distance is 0 -> which satisfies (dx==0 and dy<=1) -> so it will be adjacent.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will output \"BUG\".\n\n   Step 4: Then the third program gets the string \"BUG\" (or \"OK\", but in this case it will be \"BUG\") and processes it as described above.\n\n        For \"BUG\":\n            B: not '.' -> else branch: s is initially false -> set s to true, no output.\n            U: not '.' -> else branch: s is true -> output '2', then set s to false.\n            G: not '.' -> else branch: s is false -> set s to true, no output.\n\n        So the output is \"2\".\n\n   Step 5: The final output is \"2\".\n\n But this is not the intended behavior of the original programs.\n\n Given the instructions, we have to do it anyway.\n\n Implementation details in Fortran:\n\n   We'll read the input for the first program.\n\n   We'll declare variables for the first program:\n\n        integer :: N, T\n        integer, allocatable :: AB(:,:)   ! dimension (N,2)\n\n   Then we'll do the dynamic programming for the first program.\n\n   We'll capture the result (max_value) by taking the max of the last row of dp.\n\n   Then we convert max_value to a string. We don't know the number of digits, so we can use an internal write.\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        write(str1, '(I0)') max_value   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces.\n\n   But note: the string might have leading spaces? We want just the digits. Using I0 should give the integer in the minimum width.\n\n   Then we pass this string to the second program.\n\n   For the second program:\n\n        We need to simulate the moves. The string is `str1` (trimmed? but note that the string is fixed length 20, so we need the actual length of the digits?).\n\n        We can use:\n\n            len_str1 = len_trim(str1)\n\n        Then we create an array of coordinates for the path. The path has len_str1+1 points (including the start).\n\n        We'll have:\n\n            integer, dimension(0:len_str1) :: x_arr, y_arr   ! 0-indexed: from step0 to step(len_str1)\n\n        Initialize: x0=0, y0=0.\n\n        Then loop over i=1 to len_str1:\n\n            c = str1(i:i)\n\n            if (c == 'L') then\n                x = x - 1\n            else if (c == 'R') then\n                x = x + 1\n            else if (c == 'U') then\n                y = y + 1\n            else if (c == 'D') then\n                y = y - 1\n            else\n                ! do nothing? (as in the Java program, if it's not one of these, then no move? but the Java program only has these cases)\n                ! In our case, it will be a digit -> so we do nothing.\n            end if\n\n            record x_arr(i)=x, y_arr(i)=y.\n\n        Then we check for collisions: \n            We need to check for every i from 0 to len_str1-3, and j from i+3 to len_str1:\n\n                dx = abs(x_arr(i) - x_arr(j))\n                dy = abs(y_arr(i) - y_arr(j))\n\n                if ((dx <= 1 .and. dy == 0) .or. (dy <= 1 .and. dx == 0)) then\n                    flag = .false.\n                    exit the loops\n                end if\n\n        Then if flag, then the second program's output is the string \"OK\", else \"BUG\".\n\n   Then we pass this string (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") to the third program.\n\n   For the third program:\n\n        We have a string (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") and we want to convert it to a string of digits.\n\n        We'll have a logical variable `s` (initialized to .false.) and a string to accumulate the output.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java prints the digits without spaces. We'll build an output string.\n\n        However, the length of the output string is at most the length of the input string (because for each character we output 0, 1, or 2 at different times? \n        actually, we output one digit per two characters sometimes?).\n\n        Actually, the Java program:\n\n            for each character in the input string:\n\n                if it is '.':\n                    if s is true -> output '1' and set s to false.\n                    else -> output '0'\n                else (meaning '-' in the original problem, but we have 'O','K','B','U','G'):\n                    if s is true -> output '2' and set s to false.\n                    else -> set s to true (and output nothing at this character)\n\n        We cannot output in the middle, so we'll build a string.\n\n        We'll have:\n\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: input3   ! which is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\"\n            integer :: len3\n            character(len=100) :: output3   ! we'll build the string, but we don't know the exact length, 100 should be enough.\n\n            integer :: pos = 0   ! current position in the output string\n            logical :: s = .false.\n\n            do i=1, len_trim(input3)\n                if (input3(i:i) == '.') then\n                    if (s) then\n                        pos = pos + 1\n                        output3(pos:pos) = '1'\n                        s = .false.\n                    else\n                        pos = pos + 1\n                        output3(pos:pos) = '0'\n                    end if\n                else\n                    if (s) then\n                        pos = pos + 1\n                        output3(pos:pos) = '2'\n                        s = .false.\n                    else\n                        s = .true.\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then the output3(1:pos) is the result.\n\n   Then we write output3(1:pos) as the final output.\n\n However, note: the third program does not have any '.' in the input if we give it \"OK\" or \"BUG\". So the entire input is non-'.' characters.\n\n   For \"OK\": \n        O: non-'.' -> s is .false. -> set s to .true. (and output nothing)\n        K: non-'.' -> s is .true. -> output '2', then set s to .false.\n        Then we have output = \"2\"\n\n   For \"BUG\":\n        B: non-'.' -> set s to .true.\n        U: non-'.' -> output '2', then set s to .false.\n        G: non-'.' -> set s to .true.\n        Then at the end, we have output = \"2\" (only one digit).\n\n   So in both cases we get \"2\", but note that the third program might not output anything for the last character if it sets s to true and then the string ends? \n   The Java program does not output at the end if s is true.\n\n   Therefore, we must note that the third program does not output an extra digit if the last character leaves s set to true.\n\n   We'll do the same.\n\n   Finally, we print the output3(1:pos).\n\n But note: the first program might be heavy (N up to 3000? and T up to 3000? but the dp array in the first program is of size (N+1) x 6001, which is about 18e6 integers, which is acceptable in Fortran?).\n\n   We must be cautious: the original Java program uses 6001 as the second dimension.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:N, 0:6000) :: dp   ! we use 0-indexing for timeAfterEat? \n\n        But note: in the Java program, the inner loop is from 0 to 6000 (inclusive). So we need 0 to 6000.\n\n        We can define:\n\n            dp(0, :) = 0\n            for i = 1 to N\n                for timeAfterEat = 0 to 6000\n                    dp(i, timeAfterEat) = dp(i-1, timeAfterEat)\n                    time = AB(i,1)   ! because AB(i-1) in Java corresponds to the i-th element in our AB array (we index from 1)\n                    value = AB(i,2)\n                    if (timeAfterEat - time >= 0 .and. timeAfterEat - time < T) then\n                        candidate = dp(i-1, timeAfterEat - time) + value\n                        if (candidate > dp(i, timeAfterEat)) then\n                            dp(i, timeAfterEat) = candidate\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end do\n\n        Then max_value = maxval(dp(N, :))\n\n   Note: We must be cautious with the bounds of timeAfterEat - time: it must be nonnegative and less than T.\n\n   Also note: the original Java program uses:\n\n        if (0 <= timeAfterEat - time && timeAfterEat - time < T)\n\n   We'll do the same.\n\n   However, note: the dp array in Java is [N+1][6001] -> so the indices for timeAfterEat go from 0 to 6000.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        dp(0:i, 0:6000)\n\n   and we initialize dp(0, j) = 0 for all j.\n\n   Then the state for the i-th item (i from 1 to N) is computed.\n\n   We'll use 0-indexing for the dp array? Actually, in Fortran we can use:\n\n        dp(0, :) for the initial state (no items)\n        dp(i, :) for after processing the first i items.\n\n   So:\n\n        do j = 0, 6000\n            dp(0, j) = 0\n        end do\n\n        do i = 1, N\n            do j = 0, 6000\n                dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j)   ! not taking the item\n                time_val = AB(i, 1)\n                value_val = AB(i, 2)\n                prev_time = j - time_val\n                if (prev_time >= 0 .and. prev_time < T) then   ! note: the condition is timeAfterEat - time in [0, T-1] (strictly less than T)\n                    candidate = dp(i-1, prev_time) + value_val\n                    if (candidate > dp(i, j)) then\n                        dp(i, j) = candidate\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        max_value = maxval(dp(N, :))\n\n   But note: the condition in Java is: \n        if (0 <= timeAfterEat - time && timeAfterEat - time < T)\n\n        which is equivalent to: \n            timeAfterEat - time >= 0 and timeAfterEat - time < T\n\n        -> time <= timeAfterEat and timeAfterEat - time < T.\n\n   However, we have:\n\n        prev_time = j - time_val   [where j is timeAfterEat]\n\n        condition: prev_time >=0 and prev_time < T   -> but note: prev_time is j - time_val, so we require:\n\n            0 <= j - time_val < T\n\n        -> time_val <= j <= time_val + T - 1\n\n   So we can optimize the inner loop to j from time_val to min(6000, time_val+T-1) but we are already looping from 0 to 6000.\n\n   Since N is at most 3000 and 6001 states, the inner loop is 6001 * 3000 = 18.003e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   Now, the entire program structure:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        !

It only does moves for 'L','R','U','D'. \n        Our string str1 is composed of digits, so there will be no moves. Therefore, the entire path is (0,0) for all points.\n\n        Then the collision check: \n            We have at least 4 points (if len_str1>=3) and all are (0,0). \n            For i=0 and j=3: \n                dx = 0, dy=0 -> then (dx<=1 and dy==0) -> true -> so flag becomes false.\n\n        Therefore, we will always set input3 = \"BUG\", unless the string has length less than 4? \n\n        For example, if max_value is 0, then the string is \"0\" -> len_str1=1 -> then the points are [0,0] at step0 and step1. \n            Then the loop for i from 0 to len_str1-3 = 1-3 = -2 -> so the loop is not entered -> flag remains .true. -> then input3=\"OK\".\n\n        But note: the condition in the second program's loop: \n            for (i = 0; i < k - 3; ++i)   [k = len_str1+1, because k starts at 1 and then increments for each character?]\n\n        Actually, in the Java program:\n\n            k = 0 initially.\n            co[0][k] = x0, co[1][k] = y0; then k++ -> k=1.\n            Then for each character, we update x,y, then set co[0][k]=x, co[1][k]=y, then k++.\n\n            So at the end, k = len_str1+1.\n\n            Then the loop: i from 0 to k-3-1? because condition i < k-3 -> i from 0 to k-4.\n\n            So if k-3 is the upper bound? \n\n            In our case, k = len_str1+1, so the loop is i from 0 to (len_str1+1-3-1) = len_str1-3? \n\n            But note: the condition is i < k-3 -> so i from 0 to k-4.\n\n            We have k points: indices 0 to k-1.\n\n            Our Fortran code uses i from 0 to len_str1 (which is k-1) and we allocated 0:len_str1.\n\n            Then the loop in Fortran: i from 0 to len_str1-3 (inclusive) and j from i+3 to len_str1.\n\n            The Java loop: i from 0 to k-4 (inclusive) and j from i+3 to k-1? \n\n            Our condition: j goes to len_str1, which is k-1 -> same.\n\n            So if the number of points is k, then we do:\n\n                i: 0 to k-4\n                j: i+3 to k-1\n\n            This is the same.\n\n        Therefore, if the string has length 1, then k=2 (points: index0 and index1). Then the loop is i from 0 to 2-4 = -2 -> not entered -> flag remains .true. -> \"OK\".\n\n        But if the string has length 3, then k=4, then i from 0 to 4-4=0? -> i=0, then j from 3 to 3 (the last point). \n            Then we check point0 and point3: both (0,0) -> adjacent -> flag becomes false -> \"BUG\".\n\n        So our Fortran code for the second program is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition in the collision check in Java is:\n\n        if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0))\n\n        This includes:\n          - same point (dx=0, dy=0) -> then both conditions: (0<=1 and 0==0) -> true.\n          - adjacent horizontally: dx=1, dy=0 -> true.\n          - adjacent vertically: dy=1, dx=0 -> true.\n\n        But note: the original problem is about not revisiting a cell? and the path should be without adjacent crossings? \n\n        Anyway, we are simulating the Java code.\n\n   We'll run the above Fortran code.\n\n   Note: There might be performance issues in the first program: 3000 * 6001 = 18.003e6 iterations, which is acceptable in Fortran? It depends on the system, but we assume so.\n\n   Also, the second program: the double loop over coordinates: \n        The outer loop: (k-3) times, inner loop: (k - i - 2) times? worst-case when k is 20 (max_value up to 10^18? but we write without leading zeros, so the string length is at most 19) -> then k=20 -> points: 21 -> then outer loop: 21-3 = 18, inner loop at worst 18 -> 18*18=324, which is acceptable.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Important: We must free the allocated arrays at the end.\n\n   We'll write the entire Fortran program accordingly.\n\n   Note: The dp array for the first program: we defined dp(0:N, 0:6000). We can make the second dimension 0:6000.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        dp(0, 0:6000) = 0\n        do i=1, N\n          do j=0, 6000\n             ... as above ...\n\n   We assume the maximum timeAfterEat is 6000.\n\n   Now, the Fortran code:"
