  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_274_A) reads two integers `n` and `k`, then a list of `n` long integers.\n    It then processes the list to count the numbers that are either not divisible by k or whose division by k is not in the set.\n    Then it prints the count.\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_59_A) reads a string and counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters.\n    Then it prints the string in all uppercase if uppercase count > lowercase, else in lowercase (if equal, also lowercase).\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer `position` and then computes an index in a sequence.\n    The sequence is defined such that the value at index `n` is 1 + (n-1)*n/2. It then finds the largest starting index `nrstSeqStartIndx`\n    such that the value at that index is <= position, and then prints (position - startIndex + 1).\n\n However, note that the entire sequence of programs is to be run with the output of each becoming the input of the next.\n\n How the chain works:\n   Input for the first program: \n        n k\n        list of n integers\n\n   Output of first program: a single integer (count)\n\n   Then the second program uses that integer (converted to a string? but note: the second program expects a string) -> but wait, the second program reads a single word.\n\n   However, the first program outputs an integer (without any space) so that integer is the entire string for the second program.\n\n   Then the second program converts that string (which is a number) to either uppercase or lowercase? Actually, it's a string of digits. \n   Converting digits to uppercase or lowercase doesn't change them. So the output of the second program is the same string of digits? \n   Because if the string is all digits, then `uppercase` and `lowercase` counts: digits are not letters. In Java, `Character.isUpperCase` and `isLowerCase` return false for digits. \n   Therefore, for a string of digits, both uppercase and lowercase counts are 0. So we have:\n        uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0 -> then the condition: if uppercase>lowercase -> false, else if lowercase>uppercase -> false -> so it goes to the else: print word.toLowerCase().\n   But toLowerCase on a string of digits leaves it unchanged.\n\n   Therefore, the second program outputs the same integer as a string (unchanged).\n\n   Then the third program reads that integer (which is the count from the first program) as `position`.\n\n   But note: the original third program expects a single long integer.\n\n   So the chain:\n        Input: n, k, and list of n longs\n        Step1: compute count -> output count (as a string of digits)\n        Step2: take that string of digits and output it unchanged (so same digits)\n        Step3: take that string of digits as a long integer and compute the result.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain can be seen as:\n        Read n and k and the list of n numbers.\n        Compute count (as in the first program).\n        Then use that count as the input to the third program (the second program does nothing for digits).\n\n   However, note: the second program is effectively a no-op for a string of digits? But what if the count is negative? The first program's count is non-negative (count of numbers) so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the second program would output the same string, so we can skip the second program? \n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence of Java programs\" so we must simulate the chain.\n\n   But note: the chain of I/O:\n\n        First program writes an integer (without any space) and then the second program reads that as a string. Then the second program writes the same string. Then the third program reads that string as a long.\n\n   So in Fortran, we can avoid the intermediate string if we are sure the second program doesn't change the digits? However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n   But note: the second program might change the string if it contained letters. However, the output of the first program is a string of digits. Therefore, the second program will output the same string of digits.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program (n, k, and the list of n numbers)\n        Step2: Compute the count (as in the first program)\n        Step3: Then take that count and use it as the input for the third program (bypassing the string conversion and then reading back, because the second program doesn't change the digits).\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must do:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program -> compute count -> output count (to a string, then read that string as the input for the second program) -> then the second program processes the string -> then output that string -> then the third program reads that string.\n\n   But note: the third program expects a long integer. The second program outputs the same string of digits. So we can read the integer from the string.\n\n   However, the problem says: the entire sequence must be in one Fortran program without I/O in the middle. Therefore, we will:\n\n        - Read the initial input (n, k, and the list of n numbers) and then compute the count (step1).\n        - Then, we have a string representation of that count (which we can form, but note the second program does not change it) so we can just use the count as an integer for the third step? \n          But the third step requires a long integer which is the same as the count.\n\n   However, note: the chain is:\n\n        First program: outputs the integer `count` (which is an int in Java, but then printed as a decimal string without spaces).\n\n        Second program: reads that string and then outputs the same string.\n\n        Third program: reads that string and converts it to a long integer.\n\n   So the input to the third program is the same as the output of the first program.\n\n   Therefore, we can avoid the intermediate string and just use the integer `count` as the input to the third program.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior is the same because the second program doesn't alter the digits.\n\n   However, to be safe, we must note: the second program might change non-digit characters? But the first program outputs only digits. So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        Step 1: Read n (integer) and k (integer, but note in Java it's long, so we use integer of kind=8 for k and the numbers) and then n integers (kind=8) for the array.\n\n        Step 2: Process the array as in the first program to compute `count`.\n\n        Step 3: Then take `count` (which is an integer) and use it as the `position` for the third program.\n\n        Step 4: Solve the third program: find the largest index `nrstSeqStartIndx` such that the value at that index (1 + (index-1)*index/2) is <= `count`, and then compute the result = (count - startIndex) + 1.\n\n        Step 5: Print the result.\n\n   But wait: what about the second program? We are skipping it? \n\n   The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". However, the second program does nothing for an input of digits. So the output of the first program is the same as the input to the third program.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate the entire chain without actually converting to a string and back. But note: the second program might have side effects? It doesn't. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we are not going to print and then read. We are going to use the integer `count` directly.\n\n   But note: what if the second program did something else? It doesn't. The string is digits -> so the output is the same as the input.\n\n   Therefore, we can combine the three without the intermediate I/O.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n and k (as integers, but k and the array elements are long in Java -> use integer(kind=8) for k and the array and count and everything that might be large)\n\n        Then, read the array of n integers (each long)\n\n        Then, process the array to compute `count` (as in the first program)\n\n        Then, use that `count` (which is an integer) as the input to the third program.\n\n        Then, compute the result for the third program.\n\n        Then, output that result.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses a set to record the numbers that are kept. We can do the same in Fortran? But we can use an array for lookup? \n        But note: the set in the first program stores the numbers that are kept. We can sort the array and then traverse, but the set is used to check for the condition: \n            if (arr[i] % k != 0) -> then count++ and add to set.\n            else if (!set.contains(arr[i] / k)) -> then count++ and add to set.\n\n        We cannot use a set in Fortran without a library? We can use an array of booleans? But the numbers can be large.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Sort the array.\n\n            Then, we traverse and mark numbers that are kept. But note: the condition: if a number x is divisible by k, then we check if x/k has been kept? \n\n            However, we traverse in increasing order? So if we see a number that is divisible by k, then we check if we have already kept x/k? \n\n            But note: we are adding the number only if we keep it. And we traverse from smallest to largest? \n\n            Actually, the array is sorted. So when we see a number x, if x is divisible by k, then x/k must be a smaller number (if k>1) and we might have encountered it? \n\n            However, what if k=1? Then x/k = x, and we are checking if we have kept x? But note: we haven't added x yet. So we won't find it? \n\n            But the condition: \n                if (arr[i] % k != 0) -> then we keep and add to set.\n                else if (!set.contains(arr[i] / k)) -> then we keep and add to set.\n\n            So for k=1: \n                x % 1 == 0 -> so we check the set for x/1 = x. Since we haven't added x (we are at the current element) then we keep it? \n                But what if there is a duplicate? The set does not allow duplicates. And we are traversing in sorted order? \n\n            Actually, the array might have duplicates? The problem does not say distinct.\n\n            Example: [1, 1] and k=1: \n                First element 1: \n                    divisible by 1 -> check set for 1 -> not present -> so we add 1 to set and count=1.\n                Second element 1:\n                    divisible by 1 -> check set: contains 1 -> so we skip.\n\n            So we avoid duplicates.\n\n            How to do without a set? We can use a dynamic array and then use a map? But Fortran doesn't have a built-in set.\n\n            We can use an array to mark which indices are kept? But then how to check for x/k? We need to know if x/k has been kept? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a boolean array to mark which numbers we keep? But the numbers can be very large.\n\n            Another idea: we traverse the sorted array and for each element x, we check if we have already kept a number that is x * k? \n            But note: condition is about x/k (so a smaller number). Actually, the condition is: if x is divisible by k, then we check if x/k has been kept? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                We'll create an array `keep` of booleans of size n, initially all false.\n\n                Then, we traverse from i=1 to n:\n\n                    if the current number is not divisible by k, then we mark keep[i]=true.\n\n                    else:\n                         let y = x / k\n                         we need to check if there is an element y that has been kept? But note: the set only contains numbers that we have kept.\n\n                         However, the array is sorted and we traverse from small to large. So if y exists, it must have appeared earlier? \n\n                         But note: the array is sorted, so if y is present, it must be at an index j < i? But we are traversing in increasing order. \n\n                         So we can do:\n\n                            We can use a hash table? But Fortran doesn't have one.\n\n                         Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                            We traverse backwards? Actually, the condition is: if we have kept y? \n\n                            We can try to use a dynamic set by maintaining a list of kept numbers? And then use binary search? \n\n            Given the constraints? The first program has n up to 10^5? We can use a binary search tree? But Fortran doesn't have one.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use an array and then use binary search to check for y in the set of kept numbers? But we are building the set as we go.\n\n            How about:\n\n                We create an empty array (or a dynamic array) of kept numbers? Then we can use a binary search for y? But then we are building the set and doing binary search for each element -> O(n log n). \n\n            Since n is 10^5, that is acceptable.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Sort the array.\n\n                Create an array (or a list) of kept numbers. We can use an array of booleans? But we need to check for the value y.\n\n                Instead, we can use a dynamic array that stores the kept numbers? Then for each element:\n\n                    if the element is not divisible by k -> then we add it to the kept array and mark count++.\n\n                    else: \n                         let y = x / k\n                         search in the kept array (which we can sort and then use binary search? but we are building it as we traverse and the kept array is also increasing? because we traverse the sorted array? \n\n                         But note: we are traversing the array in increasing order. The kept array is also increasing? because we are adding in increasing order? \n\n                         So we can use a binary search on the kept array to check for y? \n\n                However, note: we are adding the current element only if we decide to keep it. And we are checking the kept array for y? The kept array does not include the current element.\n\n            But note: the condition in the original program: we check the set that we have built so far (which does not include the current element). \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                We'll have an array `kept` (dynamic) and we traverse the sorted array:\n\n                    if (x % k != 0) then \n                         count = count + 1\n                         add x to `kept` and also mark that we added it? and then sort `kept`? But we are adding in increasing order so we can just append and then use binary search? \n\n                But we are adding in increasing order? So the kept array is sorted? Then we can do a binary search for y in the kept array.\n\n            However, we are adding the numbers in increasing order, so we can maintain the kept array as sorted by appending at the end? Then we can use binary search.\n\n            But note: we are only adding when we decide to keep. The array `arr` is sorted, so the kept array is also sorted? \n\n            But what if we skip some? Then the kept array is a subsequence of the sorted array? Then it is sorted? \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                kept = []   (empty array)\n                count = 0\n\n                for i from 1 to n:\n                    if (mod(arr(i), k) /= 0) then\n                         count = count + 1\n                         append arr(i) to kept\n                    else\n                         y = arr(i) / k   (integer division? note: in Java, for integers, if not divisible we skip? but we are in the else branch so divisible? but note: k is long, and arr(i) is long -> integer division? But in the condition we already checked mod, so it is divisible)\n\n                         Now, we want to check if y is in the kept array? \n\n                         We can do a binary search in the kept array (which is sorted) for the value y.\n\n                         If we don't find y, then we add arr(i) to kept and increment count.\n\n            But note: the set in Java is a HashSet, so it doesn't guarantee order? But we are building the kept array in increasing order? and the binary search will work.\n\n            However, what if there are multiple copies of y? We only need to know if at least one y is in kept.\n\n            But note: the kept array does not have duplicates? Because we are traversing the sorted array and we are adding an element only if it is not divisible or if divisible and then we check for y? \n\n            But what if we have two copies of y? Then the first time we see y (if it is not divisible by k) we add it. Then the next time we see y (as a divisor for y*k) we will skip? \n\n            Actually, the condition for the second y: \n                if y is divisible by k? then we check if y/k is in the set? \n\n            So it's recursive? But note: we are processing in increasing order. So when we see y, we add it (if it is not divisible by k) and then when we see y*k, we check and then skip? \n\n            Therefore, the kept array does not contain duplicates? \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                kept = []   (dynamic array of integers of kind=8, initially size=0)\n                count = 0\n\n                sort the array (we read the array and then sort it)\n\n                do i = 1, n\n                    if (modulo(arr(i), k) /= 0) then\n                         count = count + 1\n                         call insert_into_kept(arr(i))   (and also maintain the sorted order? actually we are appending? but we want to keep sorted? but we are traversing sorted array and appending at the end? so kept is sorted? \n                    else\n                         y = arr(i) / k   (integer division? but note: k might not be integer? but k is integer. And we checked mod=0, so integer division is exact.\n\n                         call binary_search(kept, y, found)\n\n                         if (.not. found) then\n                             count = count + 1\n                             call insert_into_kept(arr(i))\n                         endif\n                    endif\n\n            We need to write a binary search routine for the kept array? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a while loop to traverse the kept array? But the kept array is sorted and we are building it in increasing order, so we can do a binary search? \n\n            But note: the kept array is growing. We can use a binary search on the entire kept array? \n\n            However, we are adding one element at a time? So we can do:\n\n                We maintain the kept array as sorted. We are adding in increasing order? So we can just append at the end? Then the kept array is sorted? \n\n            Therefore, we can do a binary search in the entire kept array (from index 1 to current size) for the value y.\n\n            How to do binary search in Fortran? We can write a function.\n\n            But note: the array might be large? 10^5 elements, and we do a binary search for each element? That would be O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a hash table? But Fortran doesn't have one. So we do binary search.\n\n        Step 3: Then we have the integer `count` (which is the result of the first program).\n\n        Step 4: Now, we use `count` as the input to the third program.\n\n            We need to compute:\n\n                We are looking for the largest index `nrstSeqStartIndx` such that:\n\n                    value = 1 + (index-1)*index/2 <= count\n\n                Then, we set:\n\n                    startIndex = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx-1)*nrstSeqStartIndx/2\n\n                Then, result = (count - startIndex) + 1\n\n            How to find `nrstSeqStartIndx`?\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n                    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) <= count)\n                         nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n                    end do\n\n                    Then, do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= count)\n                         nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n                    end do\n\n                Then, startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n                Then, result = count - startIndex + 1\n\n        Step 5: Print result.\n\n   However, note: the third program in Java uses a while loop that doubles until the value at index*2 is less than the position? Actually:\n\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n            nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n        }\n\n        Then, while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\n        So we are looking for the largest index such that the value at that index <= position.\n\n        Then, the value at that index is `startIndex`, and then the result is (position - startIndex) + 1.\n\n   But note: the value at index `n` is: 1 + (n-1)*n/2.\n\n   How to compute: \n\n        function getValueAtIndex(n) = 1 + n*(n-1)/2\n\n   We have to be cautious: n is integer, so we can do integer arithmetic.\n\n   But note: n*(n-1)/2 might be large? But count is at most 10^5? Actually, the first program: n is the size of the array (up to 10^5) so the count is at most 10^5. Then the third program input is up to 10^5.\n\n        Then, the index we are looking for: the value at index `n` is about n^2/2. So the index we are looking for is about sqrt(2 * count). Since count <= 10^5, then the index is about sqrt(200000) ~ 447, so we can even do a linear scan? But the doubling is efficient.\n\n   But let's do the doubling as in the original.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        function getValueAtIndex(index) result(val)\n            integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: index\n            integer(kind=8) :: val\n            val = 1 + (index-1)*index/2   ! Note: integer arithmetic: (index-1)*index is even? Not necessarily, but then divided by 2 -> integer division? \n            ! But in Fortran, for integers, it truncates? We want integer division? But the formula: n*(n-1) is even? because consecutive integers? Yes, so it's an integer.\n\n        end function\n\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n        do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) <= count)   ! Actually, in Java: < position (which is count) -> but note the condition: \n            ! The original: while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) \n            if (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) < count) then\n                nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n            else\n                exit\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        Then, do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= count)\n            nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n        end do\n\n        startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n        result = count - startIndex + 1\n\n   Then print result.\n\n   But note: the doubling loop condition: the original uses <, not <=? \n\n        while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n\n        So we do:\n\n            do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) < count)\n\n        Then the next loop: while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position) -> so we do:\n\n            do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= count)\n\n   Then compute the result.\n\n   However, note: the doubling loop multiplies by 2 until the value at the doubled index is at least `count`. Then we do the increment.\n\n   This finds the largest index such that the value at that index is <= count? \n\n        The next loop: we increment nrstSeqStartIndx as long as the next index (nrstSeqStartIndx+1) has value <= count.\n\n        So at the end, nrstSeqStartIndx is the largest index such that the value at that index <= count.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   Now, let's code in Fortran.\n\n   We assume that the integers can be large, so we use integer(kind=8) for:\n\n        n, k, the array, count, the kept array, the binary search, the third program variables.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Program main\n\n        implicit none\n\n        !

But the problem does not specify the language version. We assume we can use a built-in? \n        ! Actually, Fortran 90 and above do not have a built-in sort. We have to write one.\n\n        !

So integer division is exact.\n\n   However, in Fortran, for integers, the division truncates towards zero. But since (index-1)*index is even, then (index-1)*index/2 is an integer.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   However, note: the doubling loop might run forever if position is very large? But the value at index `index` is about index^2/2. So the doubling loop will break when index*2 is about sqrt(2*position). Since position is at most 10^5, then the doubling loop runs about log2(sqrt(200000)) ~ 8 steps? \n\n   Then the increment loop runs at most about the step from the doubled index to the next? But we break when we exceed. So the increment loop runs at most the gap between the doubled index and the desired index? which is about sqrt(2*position)? So about 447 steps? which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the doubling loop condition: \n\n        do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) < position)\n\n        If position is 0? Then the condition fails? \n\n        The first program: count1 is at least 0. If position=0, then the doubling loop condition: getValueAtIndex(2) = 1+ (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2 -> 2<0 is false -> so skip. Then the next loop: getValueAtIndex(1+1)=getValueAtIndex(2)=2<=0? false. Then result = 0 - getValueAtIndex(1) + 1 = 0 - (1) + 1 = 0.\n\n        But what is the third program for input 0? \n\n        The original Java program: \n            position = 0.\n            nrstSeqStartIndx = 1.\n            Then while (getValueAtIndex(2) < 0) -> false -> skip.\n            Then while (getValueAtIndex(2) <= 0) -> 2<=0 -> false -> skip.\n            Then startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n            Then result = (0-1)+1 = 0.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n   But note: the quicksort subroutine: we use a simple pivot at the middle. And we do the Hoare partition. \n\n   We must test with small cases? But we assume it works.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the built-in sort? But Fortran doesn't have one? We can use an external library? The problem does not specify.\n\n   We'll write the quicksort.\n\n   However, note: the array is of integers (kind=8). \n\n   Let's test with a small array.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler bubble sort? But n=10^5 -> too slow.\n\n   So we use the quicksort above.\n\n   But note: the partition might be inefficient? We use a pivot at the middle. \n\n   We'll assume it works.\n\n   Now, write the entire Fortran program.\n\n   Note: We must use integer(kind=8) for all large integers.\n\n   One more thing: the set in the first program is a HashSet, which does not preserve order. But we are building the kept array by traversing the sorted array and appending? And then we sort the kept array? No, we are not sorting the kept array again. We are appending at the end? And the array `arr` is sorted. So the kept array is sorted? \n\n   Therefore, the binary search in the kept array is valid.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Code:\n\n   (We'll write the entire program)\n\n   Important: We must not use any I/O in the middle.\n\n   We assume that the input is from standard input and output to standard output.\n\n   We read the first two integers (n, k) and then n integers for the array.\n\n   Then we process.\n\n   Then we output one integer (the result).\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious with the integer division: in Fortran, for negative numbers? But the problem states: the numbers in the array are positive? (because in the first program: we have modulo and division). The problem does not specify, but the example inputs are positive. We assume non-negative.\n\n   Since k is positive (the problem says k is long, but the input constraints? k>=1? because in the condition we do modulo and division by k). We assume k>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we proceed."
