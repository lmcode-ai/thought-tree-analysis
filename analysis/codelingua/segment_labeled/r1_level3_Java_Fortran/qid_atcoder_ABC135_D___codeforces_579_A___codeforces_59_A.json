In this string, all the characters are digits (so they are neither uppercase nor lowercase? Actually, the `Character.isUpperCase` and `isLowerCase` for digits return false). \n\n   Let's check the third program: \n        It counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. \n        Since the string we are passing is a string of digits (and possibly a minus sign? but note: the second program's input is nonnegative because it's from the first program's output which is a nonnegative integer modulo 1e9+7, and the count of ones is also nonnegative) so the string of `res2` will be composed of digits only.\n\n   Therefore, in the third program:\n        uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0 -> so the condition: \n            if uppercase > lowercase -> false\n            else if lowercase > uppercase -> false\n            else -> use word.toLowerCase() -> which will return the same string of digits in lowercase? but digits are not affected by case conversion.\n\n   So the output of the third program would be the same as the input string (the string of digits of `res2`).\n\n   However, this does not match the original chain? \n\n   But note: the original chain is independent and we are just chaining the output of one as input to the next. The third program is designed to work on arbitrary strings, but in our chain the input to the third program is a string of digits. So the output is the same.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that the chain is not as described? But the instruction says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we run the first, then the second, then the third.\n\n   However, looking at the programs, they are not designed to be chained. The first program reads a string of digits and '?' and outputs an integer. The second program reads an integer from stdin and outputs the count of ones. The third program reads a string and outputs a string. \n\n   So the chain would be:\n        Input to the entire system: the string for the first program.\n        Output of the entire system: the string from the third program.\n\n   How to run:\n        Step 1: Read the string (for the first program).\n        Step 2: Run the first program to get an integer (res1).\n        Step 3: Pass res1 to the second program to get an integer (res2) which is the count of ones in the binary representation of res1.\n        Step 4: Convert res2 to a string (without any non-digit characters) and pass to the third program. The third program will then output that same string (because the string is all digits, so the case conversion does nothing).\n\n   Therefore, the final output of the entire Fortran program is the string representation of res2 (the count of ones).\n\n   But wait: the original third program would output the string in lowercase if there are as many uppercase as lowercase, which is the case for a string of digits? Actually, in the third program, the string of digits has no letters at all, so both counts are 0 -> so it outputs the string in lowercase. However, converting a string of digits to lowercase leaves it unchanged.\n\n   So the output is the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can skip the third program's processing because we know the string is digits? But we are to reproduce the same behavior.\n\n   However, note: the third program is designed for letters. For a string of digits, the output is the same as the input. So we can just output the string representation of res2.\n\n   But we are to write the entire sequence without I/O in the middle.\n\n   Steps in Fortran:\n\n    1. Read the initial string (from stdin).\n    2. Run the first program's logic (without printing anything) to get an integer `res1`.\n    3. Run the second program's logic on `res1` to get an integer `res2` (the count of ones).\n    4. Convert `res2` to a string and then run the third program's logic on that string? But the third program's logic for a string of digits is to output the same string. However, we are required to run the entire sequence.\n\n   But note: the third program does not output the string until the very end. We are to have only the last block producing output.\n\n   However, the third program's output is the same as the input string (if it's digits) so we could just output the string representation of `res2`. But we must follow the instructions: run the entire sequence.\n\n   Therefore, we will do:\n\n      Step 1: Read the string for the first program.\n\n      Step 2: Process the first program (atcoder_ABC135_D) to compute `res1`.\n\n      Step 3: Use `res1` as input to the second program (codeforces_579_A) to compute `res2` (the count of ones).\n\n      Step 4: Convert `res2` to a string (call it `s_res2`).\n\n      Step 5: Process the third program (codeforces_59_A) on the string `s_res2` to produce an output string. Since `s_res2` is a string of digits, the output will be `s_res2` (because converting to lowercase leaves digits unchanged).\n\n      Step 6: Write the output string (which is `s_res2`).\n\n   But note: the third program's output is the string after conversion. Since the conversion does nothing, we can just output `s_res2`.\n\n   However, to be faithful, we will code the logic of the third program.\n\n   How to represent:\n\n     We are to write a single Fortran program.\n\n     We'll have:\n\n        program main\n          implicit none\n\n          ! ... variables ...\n\n          ! Step 1: Read the initial string\n          character(100000) :: s  ! We don't know the length, but let's assume a large enough size.\n          integer :: res1, res2\n          character(100) :: s_res2  ! For the integer from res2, 100 digits is enough.\n\n          ! Step 2: Run the first program's logic on s to get res1.\n\n          ! Step 3: Run the second program's logic on res1 to get res2.\n\n          ! Step 4: Convert res2 to a string -> s_res2\n\n          ! Step 5: Run the third program's logic on s_res2 to produce the output string.\n\n          ! Step 6: Write the output string.\n\n        end program\n\n   However, note: the first program uses a modulus of 1e9+7. We can use a parameter for that.\n\n   But the first program uses a DP array of size [length of string][13]. The string can be long? We need to allocate accordingly.\n\n   We must be cautious about the length.\n\n   Steps for the first program:\n\n      We are processing the string in reverse. We have a DP array for each character position and modulo 13.\n\n      We need:\n          integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n          character(:), allocatable :: cs   ! The input string\n          integer :: n   ! length of the string\n          integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)   ! dp(0:n-1, 0:12)  [n rows, 13 columns] but note: the original uses 0-indexed for the string and the modulus.\n\n      However, Fortran arrays are column-major and we can do:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:12, 0:n-1)   ! But we are going to iterate by position. Alternatively, we can have dp(0:n-1, 0:12) but then we have to be careful with memory.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a 2D array: dp(0:12, 0:1) for current and previous? because we only need the previous step.\n\n      The original code:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n            ... update dp[i][*] based on dp[i-1][*] (if i>0) ...\n\n      We can do:\n\n          dp_prev(0:12)  ! for the previous row\n          dp_current(0:12) ! for the current row\n\n      Steps:\n\n          base = 1\n          for i from 0 to n-1:\n             index in the string: we are processing from last character to first? \n                 original: cs[cs.length-1-i]\n\n          So we traverse the string backwards.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          n = len_trim(s)   ! or we read the string and then set n = len_trim(s) ? but the original reads the entire string including trailing?\n\n          Actually, the Java program uses `sc.next()` so it's a token without spaces.\n\n      We assume the input string has no spaces.\n\n   Let's code the first program:\n\n      MOD = 1000000007_8   ! using 8-byte integers\n\n      We read the string:\n\n          read(*,*) s   ! s is a character variable of sufficient length.\n\n          n = len_trim(s)\n\n      Then we set:\n\n          integer :: base\n          integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_current(0:12)\n          integer :: i, j, k, digit\n\n          ! Initialize: \n          base = 1\n          dp_prev = 0\n          dp_prev(0) = 1   ! because at the beginning (i=-1) we have state 0.\n\n          But note: the original dp array for i=0: \n            if we are at the first character (i=0) then we do:\n                if the character is '?' then we try digits 0-9, and set:\n                   dp[0][ (base * next) % 13 ] += 1   (because pre is 0 and we use the initial state)\n\n          So we can do:\n\n             for i = 0, n-1\n\n                dp_current = 0   ! set current row to zero\n\n                ! Get the character at position: n - i   (because the string is stored from 1 to n, and we want the last character first)\n\n                c = s(n-i:n-i)   ! if we have s as a string of length n, then the first character is at 1, last at n.\n\n                if (c == '?') then\n                   do next = 0, 9\n                      do pre_state = 0, 12\n                         if (dp_prev(pre_state) > 0) then\n                            new_state = mod(base * next + pre_state, 13)\n                            dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n                         end if\n                      end do\n                   end do\n                else\n                   read(c, *) digit   ! convert char to integer\n                   do pre_state = 0, 12\n                      if (dp_prev(pre_state) > 0) then\n                         new_state = mod(base * digit + pre_state, 13)\n                         dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n                      end if\n                   end do\n                end if\n\n                ! Then update base: base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n                base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n                ! Then set dp_prev = dp_current for the next iteration.\n\n          Then after the loop, res1 = dp_prev(5)   because the last state is stored in dp_prev (which is the dp_current of the last step) and we want the state 5.\n\n      But note: the original uses the entire string and the last row's state 5.\n\n   However, note: the base is updated for each character. We start at base=1 for the last character, then base=10, then 100 mod13, etc.\n\n   The above loop goes from the last character to the first? Actually, in the original:\n\n        for i=0: we process the last character (index cs.length-1-0) -> the last.\n\n        then i=1: the second last, etc.\n\n        and base is multiplied by 10 mod13 at the end of each iteration.\n\n   So we are processing the string from the last character to the first.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        base = 1\n        dp_prev(0) = 1   ! and others 0\n\n        do i = 1, n   ! we are going to process each character in the string from last to first.\n\n           c = s(n-i+1:n-i+1)   ! because the string s(1:n): \n                   i=1 -> position: n - 1 + 1 = n -> last character\n                   i=2 -> n-1 -> second last, etc.\n\n        Then update.\n\n   Then after the loop, res1 = dp_prev(5)\n\n   Step 3: Second program\n\n        input: res1 (an integer)\n\n        We want to compute the number of ones in the binary representation of res1.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            res2 = 0\n            temp = res1\n            do while (temp > 0)\n                if (mod(temp,2) == 1) res2 = res2 + 1\n                temp = temp / 2\n            end do\n\n        But note: the original uses a string and then counts the ones. But we can do without the string.\n\n   Step 4: Convert res2 to a string.\n\n        We can write to an internal file:\n\n            write(s_res2, '(I0)') res2   ! This writes the integer without leading zeros and adjusts the length.\n\n        Then we set the actual string to use: but we have to know the length? \n\n        Then we pass s_res2 to the third program.\n\n   Step 5: Third program\n\n        input: the string s_res2 (which is the string representation of res2)\n\n        We need to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters? But the string is digits, so both counts will be 0.\n\n        Then the program outputs the string in lowercase? which is the same as the input.\n\n        So we can simply output s_res2.\n\n        However, to be faithful, we'll code the logic:\n\n            integer :: uppercase, lowercase, i\n            character(len=len_trim(s_res2)) :: output_str\n\n            uppercase = 0\n            lowercase = 0\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(s_res2)\n                c = s_res2(i:i)\n                if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                    uppercase = uppercase + 1\n                else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n                    lowercase = lowercase + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n                ! convert the whole string to uppercase\n                output_str = to_upper(s_res2)   ! we have to write to_upper?\n            else\n                ! convert to lowercase\n                output_str = to_lower(s_res2)\n            end if\n\n        But note: the string is digits, so we don't need to change anything. We can avoid the conversion, but we do it for correctness.\n\n        However, Fortran doesn't have built-in to_upper or to_lower for strings? We can write our own.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the string is digits and skip the conversion? But to be general we write the conversion.\n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must do.\n\n        We can write helper functions? But the program is short.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            output_str = s_res2   ! by default\n\n            if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n                do i = 1, len_trim(s_res2)\n                    c = s_res2(i:i)\n                    if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n                        output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)   ! to uppercase\n                    end if\n                end do\n            else\n                do i = 1, len_trim(s_res2)\n                    c = s_res2(i:i)\n                    if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                        output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end if\n\n        But note: the original uses `word.toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`. These convert all letters to the case. But our string has no letters, so no change.\n\n   Step 6: Write output_str (trimmed to the actual length) without trailing spaces? But we stored without leading spaces.\n\n   However, we write the entire string without trailing spaces: we can output trim(output_str) but note: we wrote the integer without leading spaces and without trailing spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the string as:\n\n        write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)\n\n   But note: the original third program outputs exactly the string (with the same case as determined) and no extra spaces.\n\n   However, the third program does not trim. The input string might have spaces? But in our case, the string is the integer representation without spaces.\n\n   So we output the entire string that we processed? But we stored the integer in a string of fixed length (100) and then we trimmed the spaces? Actually, when we write with '(I0)', it has no leading spaces. Then we stored in s_res2 which is a fixed length of 100, so we have trailing spaces? \n\n   We need to remove the trailing spaces.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        s_res2 = adjustl(s_res2)   ! remove leading spaces? but I0 doesn't have leading spaces. Actually, we can use:\n\n        write(s_res2, '(I0)') res2   ! and then the string will have the integer without leading zeros and without leading spaces, but the variable s_res2 is of length 100, so the rest are spaces.\n\n        Then when we do the third program, we should consider the entire variable? But the original third program counts the entire string. We only want the digits.\n\n        So we should only process the non-space part? \n\n        How about we work with a substring without trailing spaces? \n\n        We can define:\n\n            character(len=100) :: temp_str\n            integer :: len_str\n\n            write(temp_str, '(I0)') res2\n            s_res2 = trim(adjustl(temp_str))   ! but adjustl is not necessary because I0 doesn't have leading spaces.\n\n        Actually, we can just use:\n\n            write(s_res2, '(I0)') res2\n\n        and then when processing, use the trimmed length? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            len_str = len_trim(s_res2)\n\n            uppercase = 0\n            lowercase = 0\n            do i = 1, len_str\n                c = s_res2(i:i)\n                ... \n\n            and then when building the output_str, we also build a string of the same length (without trailing spaces).\n\n        But then output_str must be of length len_str? \n\n        We can define:\n\n            character(len=len_str) :: output_str\n\n        But we don't know len_str until after we write s_res2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            output_str = s_res2(1:len_str)   ! and then do the conversion on that substring? but we are going to write the entire variable.\n\n        Actually, we can just do:\n\n            ! Count the letters in the non-space part: from 1 to len_trim(s_res2)\n\n            ! Then convert that substring? But we have to output the entire substring without trailing spaces.\n\n        So we'll create a substring without the trailing spaces for processing.\n\n        However, we can also note that the trailing spaces are not letters, so they don't affect the count. But we must not convert the trailing spaces? \n\n        The original program would convert the entire string including trailing spaces? But in the original, the input string is read by `in.next()` which is tokenized (without spaces). So we don't have spaces.\n\n        In our case, the string s_res2 is written without leading spaces, but we stored in a fixed-length string so it has trailing spaces. However, the original third program would have read the entire token (without spaces). So we should only consider the non-space part.\n\n        Therefore, we can:\n\n            s_trim = trim(s_res2)   ! remove trailing spaces\n\n            Then use s_trim for the third program.\n\n        But note: the third program doesn't know about trailing spaces because the input token is without spaces. So we process the trimmed string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the fixed-length string for the integer by using a variable-length string? Fortran 2003 allows allocatable character:\n\n        character(:), allocatable :: s_trim\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') res2\n        s_trim = trim(temp_str)\n\n        Then we can use s_trim as the input to the third program.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\", but we are allowed to do internal processing.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        ! Step 4: \n        character(100) :: temp_str\n        character(:), allocatable :: s_trim\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') res2\n        s_trim = trim(temp_str)\n\n        ! Step 5: \n        ... process the string s_trim ...\n\n        Then output the result.\n\n   But note: the third program outputs the entire string. We output s_trim (possibly converted) and that's the same as the integer string without spaces.\n\n   Now, we code.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses a modulus of 1e9+7 and the numbers can be large. We use integer(kind=8) for the dp arrays and for the modulus arithmetic.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n\n   and declare:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_current(0:12)\n\n   Also, base: integer (mod 13) so 4-byte is enough.\n\n   Let's code step-by-step.\n\n   Due to complexity, we break the first program into a loop with dynamic allocation of the string length.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Read the string s.\n\n      n = len_trim(s)   ! but note: the string might have trailing spaces? the original uses next(), so no. So we read without trailing spaces? \n\n      How we read: \n\n          character(10000) :: s   ! assume max length 10000\n\n          read(*, '(A)') s   ! but this will read up to 10000 characters? \n\n          But we want the actual length without trailing spaces: \n\n          n = len_trim(s)\n\n      Then we do the DP.\n\n   We note: the original program uses the entire string including the trailing part? But the string is read by `sc.next()` so it's a token without spaces.\n\n   So we assume the input string is without trailing spaces.\n\n   Now, write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The base starts at 1 and then is updated: base = base * 10 mod 13 at the end of each iteration.\n\n   We do:\n\n        base = 1\n        dp_prev = 0_8   ! set to zero with kind=8\n        dp_prev(0) = 1_8\n\n        do i = 0, n-1   ! we process each character: from the last to the first.\n\n           pos = n - i   ! because the string s is from 1 to n: the last character is at n, then n-1, etc.\n\n           c = s(pos:pos)\n\n           dp_current = 0_8   ! reset current row\n\n           if (c == '?') then\n              do next_digit = 0, 9\n                 do pre_state = 0, 12\n                    if (dp_prev(pre_state) > 0) then\n                       new_state = mod(next_digit * base + pre_state, 13)\n                       dp_current(new_state) = dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state)\n                       if (dp_current(new_state) >= MOD) dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state), MOD)\n                    end if\n                 end do\n              end do\n           else\n              ! Convert the character to integer\n              read(c, *) digit\n              do pre_state = 0, 12\n                 if (dp_prev(pre_state) > 0) then\n                    new_state = mod(digit * base + pre_state, 13)\n                    dp_current(new_state) = dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state)\n                    if (dp_current(new_state) >= MOD) dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state), MOD)\n                 end if\n              end do\n           end if\n\n           base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n           dp_prev = dp_current   ! for the next iteration\n\n        end do\n\n        res1 = dp_prev(5)\n\n   Then step 3: compute res2 (the number of ones in the binary representation of res1)\n\n        res2 = 0\n        temp = res1\n        do while (temp > 0)\n            if (mod(temp,2) == 1) res2 = res2 + 1\n            temp = temp / 2\n        end do\n\n   Then step 4: convert res2 to a string.\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') res2\n        s_trim = trim(adjustl(temp_str))   ! adjustl is not necessary because I0 has no leading spaces, but we trim.\n\n        But note: we can just do:\n\n            s_trim = trim(temp_str)\n\n   Then step 5: process the third program on s_trim.\n\n        We count the uppercase and lowercase letters? But the string is digits, so both counts are 0.\n\n        Then we choose to output the string in lowercase? which is the same as the input.\n\n        So we can simply output s_trim.\n\n        But we code:\n\n            uppercase = 0\n            lowercase = 0\n            len_str = len(s_trim)\n\n            do i = 1, len_str\n                c = s_trim(i:i)\n                if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                    uppercase = uppercase + 1\n                else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n                    lowercase = lowercase + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n                ! convert to uppercase: but no letters, so we just assign\n                output_str = s_trim\n                ! But if there were letters, we would convert to uppercase? But there are none.\n            else\n                output_str = s_trim   ! and we could convert to lowercase? but same.\n            end if\n\n        Then write(*,*) trim(output_str)   ? But the original uses System.out.println which outputs without extra spaces? \n\n        However, we must output without any extra spaces. We can use:\n\n            write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)\n\n        But note: the string s_trim is already without trailing spaces.\n\n   However, the third program in the original outputs the entire string without any extra spaces.\n\n   But note: the original third program outputs the string as is? Actually, it outputs either word.toUpperCase() or word.toLowerCase() and then a newline.\n\n   We output the string and then a newline? \n\n        write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)   ! this will output the string without quotes and with a newline.\n\n   But the original Java programs output without extra spaces and then a newline.\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   Now, we write the entire program.\n\n   Note: We are using Fortran 90 or later.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The modulus operation for base is mod(base * 10, 13) and base is integer.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer :: base, new_base\n\n        base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n   But base can be negative? no, because we start with 1 and mod 13 is positive.\n\n   Also, the new_state calculation: mod(next_digit * base + pre_state, 13) -> we want a nonnegative modulo.\n\n        new_state = mod( ... , 13)   ! in Fortran, mod returns a nonnegative result if the modulus is positive.\n\n   However, if the number is negative? We are using nonnegative numbers.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   We'll code the entire program.\n\n   Due to the complexity of the first part, we'll use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_current(0:12)\n        integer :: base, i, j, digit, pre_state, next_digit, new_state\n        character(10000) :: s   ! for the first string\n        integer :: n, temp, res1, res2\n        character(100) :: temp_str   ! for converting res2\n        character(:), allocatable :: s_trim\n        integer :: uppercase, lowercase, len_str\n        character :: c\n        character(100) :: output_str   ! for the third program's output, but we know the length of s_trim is small.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        read(*, '(A)') s\n        n = len_trim(s)\n\n        !

But we are not testing, we are writing.\n\n   We assume the logic.\n\n   But note: the first program is complex and we must be cautious.\n\n   We can avoid the inner loops for the '?' case by vectorizing? But we do the straightforward way.\n\n   Also, we must note: the modulus operations for the DP: we do mod at the end? The original does modulo at every step.\n\n   We do: if (dp_current(new_state) >= MOD) then mod. But we can do modulo every time? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n\n   But the numbers can be huge? We do modulo after adding.\n\n   We change:\n\n        dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n\n   But note: the original does modulo at every addition.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n\n   But we are using 8-byte integers and MOD is 10^9+7, so we can do modulo at every step.\n\n   So we change the inner loop to:\n\n        dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n\n   But note: we are accumulating over next_digit and pre_state? So we cannot do modulo until we finish the pre_state loop? \n\n   Actually, we can do modulo at every addition because the modulus is large enough and the additions are linear.\n\n   We do:\n\n        dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n\n   Then we remove the if condition.\n\n   So:\n\n        do next_digit = 0, 9\n            do pre_state = 0, 12\n                new_state = mod(next_digit * base + pre_state, 13)\n                dp_current(new_state) = mod(dp_current(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD)\n            end do\n        end do\n\n   But note: the original does:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\n        then mod MOD.\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   Similarly for the non-question mark branch.\n\n   We can simplify.\n\n   Now, we write the entire code.\n\n   Note: The variable base is multiplied by 10 mod 13, and we do that at the end of the loop.\n\n   We also note: the modulus 13 is small, so we can use integer(4) for base and new_state.\n\n   But dp_prev and dp_current are 8-byte because the numbers can be up to 10^9+7.\n\n   We'll do.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The first program's state is modulo 13, and the base is mod 13. We do:\n\n        new_state = mod( ... , 13)\n\n   But note: the expression (next_digit * base + pre_state) might be negative? \n\n        next_digit: 0 to 9 -> nonnegative\n        base: 1, 10, 9, 12, ... mod13 -> nonnegative\n        pre_state: 0 to 12 -> nonnegative\n\n   So nonnegative.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        new_state = mod( ... , 13)\n\n   which is nonnegative.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   We'll write the Fortran program.\n\n   Note: We must declare the variables.\n\n   We assume the input string is no longer than 10000.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n\n        integer, parameter :: MOD8 = 1000000007_8\n        character(100000) :: s  !

This will pad with spaces to the right? but we are going to output only the non-space part.\n\n        if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n            do i = 1, len_str\n                c = s_trim(i:i)\n                if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n                end if\n            end do\n        else\n            do i = 1, len_str\n                c = s_trim(i:i)\n                if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n                end if\n            end do\n        end if\n\n        ! Write the output: we output the string without trailing spaces? \n        ! But output_str is of fixed length 100. We want only the first len_str characters.\n        write(*, '(A)') output_str(1:len_str)\n\n        end program\n\n   But note: the third program's output might be the entire fixed-length string? We must only output the part that corresponds to the integer.\n\n   We use:\n\n        write(*, '(A)') output_str(1:len_str)\n\n   This outputs the string without trailing spaces.\n\n   We assume that the output_str(1:len_str) is the string we built.\n\n   This should be the same as s_trim (because there were no letters) so we are effectively outputting the integer string.\n\n   Now, we hope it works.\n\n   We note: the first program is complex and might have off-by-ones? We did:\n\n        do i = 0, n-1: \n            character at position n-i.\n\n        and we started with the last character.\n\n        The original: \n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                cs[cs.length - 1 - i]   -> so for i=0: the last character (index cs.length-1)\n\n        In Fortran, our string s is indexed from 1 to n. \n            The last character is at n -> so we want: n - i, with i=0 -> n-0 = n -> correct.\n\n        Then i=1: we get n-1 -> the second last.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n   We run the loop for n steps.\n\n   We start with dp_prev(0)=1 and then update.\n\n   After the loop, res1 = dp_prev(5) -> the state after processing the entire string.\n\n   This matches the original.\n\n   We are done."
