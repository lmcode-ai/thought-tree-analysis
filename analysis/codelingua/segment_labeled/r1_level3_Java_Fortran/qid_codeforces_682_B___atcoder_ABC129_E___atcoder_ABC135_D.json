Let n2 = len(str1_trimmed) We need a DP array: dp2(0:n2, 2)   -> in Fortran: dp2(0:n2, 0:1) because the original had [0] and [1]. Steps as in the Java code:\n\n          M = 1000000007\n          dp2(0,0) = 1\n          dp2(0,1) = 0   ? Actually, in the Java code, the array is initialized to zeros? Then we set [0][0]=1.

Similarly:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str2\n        write(str2, '(I0)') result2\n        str2_trimmed = trim(str2)\n\n   Step 8: Run the third program's logic on the string `str2_trimmed`. We note: the third program processes the string from right to left. Let s = str2_trimmed\n        Let n3 = len(s) We'll reverse the string? Or process from the last character to the first? The original Java code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') {\n                    ... \n                } else {\n                    next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0'\n                }\n            } So it processes the string from the last character to the first (i=0 corresponds to the last character). We can process the string in the same order: for i=0 to n3-1, we take the character at position n3 - i.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          MOD3 = 1000000007 (but note: the third program uses MOD = 10^9+7, which is the same as M? Actually, 10^9+7 = 1000000007, so same modulus). We have dp3(0:n3-1, 0:12)   -> in Fortran: dp3(0:12, 0:n3-1) might be more efficient? But the original uses [i][pre].

The first program (codeforces_682_B) reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and then computes a value `c`.\n    Output: `c`\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string of binary digits (without spaces) and computes a dynamic programming solution for counting valid expressions modulo M=1000000007.\n    Output: (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string (which may contain digits and '?') and computes a DP for the number of ways to form a number that modulo 13 is 5 (with the string processed from right to left) modulo 1e9+7.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is an integer, which becomes the input to the second program? But looking at the second program, it reads a string of characters. Similarly, the third program reads a string.\n\n But the problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n How the chain works?\n   Input for the first program: \n        n\n        a1 a2 ... an\n   Output of first program: an integer c.\n\n   Then the second program takes as input a string (which in the example above was read by `sc.nextLine()`). So the integer c would be the first token? But the second program expects a string of binary digits.\n\n   Similarly, the third program expects a string.\n\n However, note the example in the problem: the entire sequence is executed in sequence. So the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first program is passed as input to the second, and the output of the second is passed to the third.\n\n But the second program expects a string. How do we reconcile?\n\n Let's reexamine the instructions: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n For the chain to work, the output of the first program must be the input of the second. The first program outputs a single integer (c). The second program expects a string. So we must convert the integer c to a string? But note: the second program in the example reads the entire next line. So if the first program outputs \"3\", then the second program would read the string \"3\". However, the second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) is designed for a string of binary digits. The example input for the second program might be \"1\" or \"0\", but actually the example in the problem is a string of 0s and 1s. \n\n But wait: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". And we are to run the chain on the same input. The original input is for the first program. Then the second program would get the output of the first as its input. Similarly, the third gets the output of the second.\n\n However, the three programs are independent and were not designed to be chained. Therefore, we must reinterpret the problem: the input to the entire Fortran program is the input for the first program (n and n integers). Then the output of the first step (the integer c) is passed as the input to the second program. The second program now must take an integer as input? But in the original, the second program takes a string. How do we handle?\n\n The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would have the first program output the integer, and then the second program would read that integer as a string. So we must format the integer as a string without any extra spaces (just the decimal representation) and then pass that string to the second program. Similarly, the second program outputs an integer (the result of the modulo computation) and the third program expects a string. So we must convert the integer output of the second program to a string and then feed it to the third program.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the list of n integers).\n Step 2: Compute the first program's result (c).\n Step 3: Convert c to a string (without any extra spaces, just the number) and use that string as the input for the second program.\n Step 4: Run the second program's logic on that string (which now is the string representation of c).\n Step 5: The second program produces an integer (modulo 1000000007). Convert that integer to a string and use it as the input for the third program.\n Step 6: Run the third program's logic on that string (which is the string representation of the second program's output).\n Step 7: Output the result of the third program.\n\n However, note: the third program outputs a long (the count modulo 1e9+7). That will be the final output.\n\n But wait: the original second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) expects a string of binary digits? But we are giving it the string representation of an integer. That integer might be, for example, 5. Then the string is \"5\", which is not a binary string. So the second program might break? \n\n Let me look at the second program: \n    It expects a string of 0s and 1s? Actually, the problem in the original context (atcoder_ABC129_E) is about counting the number of ways to split a binary string. But our input is an integer? \n\n This indicates that the chain might not be meaningful. However, the problem states: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must do exactly that.\n\n Therefore, we have to run the second program with the string that is the decimal representation of the integer c. Similarly, the third program gets the decimal representation of the integer result from the second.\n\n But note: the third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) is designed for a string that may contain digits and '?'. Our string from the second program is a string of digits (no '?')? So the third program will work because it handles digits and '?'. Since our string has only digits (no '?'), then we can run it.\n\n However, the third program processes the string from right to left. It is computing the number of ways to assign digits (if there were '?' we would consider all digits) but in our case, the string is fixed (no '?') so we are just computing the number of ways for a fixed string? Actually, the program handles both: if the character is not '?', then it uses that digit.\n\n Therefore, we can run the third program on the string of digits from the second program's output.\n\n Steps in Fortran:\n\n 1. Read the first input: an integer n, then n integers.\n 2. Compute the first program's result (c).\n 3. Convert c to a string (call it s1).\n 4. Use s1 as the input string for the second program.\n    - We have to run the dynamic programming of the second program on s1.\n 5. The second program produces an integer result (res2) modulo 1000000007.\n 6. Convert res2 to a string (call it s2).\n 7. Use s2 as the input string for the third program.\n 8. The third program produces a long integer result (res3) modulo (10^9+7).\n 9. Print res3.\n\n Important: We must not do any I/O in the intermediate steps. So we do all computations in memory and only the final output is printed.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We'll write a Fortran program that:\n\n   - Reads the initial integer n and then n integers.\n   - Sorts the integers and computes c (as in the first Java program).\n   - Converts c to a string (we'll use internal file I/O for conversion, but note: no I/O to external files, just internal formatting).\n   - Then runs the DP of the second program on that string.\n   - Then converts the result (an integer) to a string.\n   - Then runs the DP of the third program on that string.\n   - Finally, prints the result of the third program.\n\n We note:\n\n   - The second program uses modulo M = 1000000007.\n   - The third program uses modulo MOD = 1000000007 (which is 10^9+7).\n\n We must be cautious with the string lengths: the integer c from the first program is at most n+1 (since we increment at most n times). So the string length of c is at most 6 or 7 digits for n up to 100000? Actually, the list values can be up to 10^9, but c starts at 1 and increments at most n times, so c <= n+1. So if n is 100000, then c is at most 100001 -> 6 digits.\n\n   Then the second program: the input string is 6 digits. The second program's DP array is of dimension [n+1][2]. The maximum n (the string length) is 6, so it's small.\n\n   The third program: the input string is the output of the second program (which is an integer modulo 1000000007, so at most 9 or 10 digits). So the string length is at most 10. The third program uses an array dp[length][13]. The length is at most 10, so it's manageable.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and the list of integers.\n\n   Step 2: Sort the list. We can use a simple sort (like bubble sort) but for efficiency we might use a better one? But n can be up to 100000? The first Java program does a sort. In Fortran, we can use the intrinsic sort? However, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort for arrays in the standard. We can write a quick sort or use a simple one if we assume the compiler has extensions? But the problem says to write a program that behaves identically.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the `sort` intrinsic if we are using a recent Fortran. But to be safe, we can write a quick sort.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". We are not constrained by performance? But we must be able to handle n up to 100000. So we need an efficient sort.\n\n   We can use a heap sort or quick sort. Let's write a quick sort.\n\n   Step 3: Then compute c.\n\n   Step 4: Convert c to a string. We can do:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        write(str1, *) c\n        ! But this will have leading spaces. We need to remove them? Actually, the second Java program reads the entire line and then converts to char array. In Java, if we print an integer, it prints without leading spaces? Actually, the Java program uses `pw.println(c)`, which prints the integer in decimal and then a newline. The next program reads the next line. So we must form a string without leading spaces and without trailing spaces? And without newline? Actually, when we convert the integer to a string, we want just the digits.\n\n        We can do: \n            write(str1, '(I0)') c\n        This gives the integer without leading spaces.\n\n   Step 5: Now we have the string `str1` (we need to know its length and remove any trailing spaces? Actually, the `I0` format gives the minimal width). But note: the string might have trailing spaces if we allocated more? We should adjust the length: we can use `trim(adjustl(str1))`? But actually, the `I0` format does not add leading spaces. However, the write statement might put the number at the beginning and then fill the rest of the string with spaces? We don't care about the spaces beyond the digits? The second program in Java does `char[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();` which would read the entire line. In Fortran, if we write the integer to a string of length 20, then the string will have the digits and then spaces. We must only use the non-space part? But the Java program will read the entire line (including the spaces after the digits?) as the next token? Actually, the nextLine() reads the entire line. But the integer we wrote did not have any space after? Actually, we are writing without any extra spaces. So the string we have in Fortran is the integer and then spaces. We want to pass the entire line? But the second program expects the entire line? We can form a string that is exactly the digits and then a newline? But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we are working with strings in memory.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        str1_trimmed = trim(str1)   ! This removes trailing spaces.\n\n   But note: the second program does not care about spaces? It will take the entire line and then convert to char array. The char array will include the digits and then the trailing spaces? Actually, no: in Java, `nextLine()` returns the entire line without the newline, and then `toCharArray` returns the characters. But if our Fortran string has trailing spaces, then the char array would include those spaces? That is not what we want.\n\n   Therefore, we should form a string that has exactly the digits and no trailing spaces. Then the length of the string is the number of digits.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        write(str1, '(I0)') c\n        len1 = len_trim(str1)   ! Actually, we don't need to store the length? We can use the trimmed string.\n\n        But then we can define:\n\n        str1_trimmed = trim(str1)\n\n   Then we use the string `str1_trimmed` for the second program.\n\n   Step 6: Run the second program's logic on the string `str1_trimmed`.\n\n        Let n2 = len(str1_trimmed)\n        We need a DP array: dp2(0:n2, 2)   -> in Fortran: dp2(0:n2, 0:1) because the original had [0] and [1].\n\n        Steps as in the Java code:\n\n          M = 1000000007\n          dp2(0,0) = 1\n          dp2(0,1) = 0   ? Actually, in the Java code, the array is initialized to zeros? Then we set [0][0]=1.\n\n          Then for i from 1 to n2 (which corresponds to index i in the string, from the first character to the last):\n\n            char = str1_trimmed(i:i)\n\n            if char == '0' then\n                dp2(i,0) = dp2(i-1,0)\n                dp2(i,1) = dp2(i-1,1)\n            else\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i-1,0) + dp2(i-1,1), M)\n            end if\n\n            Then, if char == '0'\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i,1) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,1), M), M)\n            else\n                dp2(i,0) = mod(dp2(i,0) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,0), M), M)\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i,1) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,1), M), M)\n            end if\n\n          Then result2 = mod(dp2(n2,0) + dp2(n2,1), M)\n\n   Step 7: Convert result2 to a string. Similarly:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str2\n        write(str2, '(I0)') result2\n        str2_trimmed = trim(str2)\n\n   Step 8: Run the third program's logic on the string `str2_trimmed`.\n\n        We note: the third program processes the string from right to left.\n\n        Let s = str2_trimmed\n        Let n3 = len(s)\n\n        We'll reverse the string? Or process from the last character to the first? The original Java code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') {\n                    ... \n                } else {\n                    next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0'\n                }\n            }\n\n        So it processes the string from the last character to the first (i=0 corresponds to the last character).\n\n        We can process the string in the same order: for i=0 to n3-1, we take the character at position n3 - i.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          MOD3 = 1000000007 (but note: the third program uses MOD = 10^9+7, which is the same as M? Actually, 10^9+7 = 1000000007, so same modulus).\n\n          We have dp3(0:n3-1, 0:12)   -> in Fortran: dp3(0:12, 0:n3-1) might be more efficient? But the original uses [i][pre]. We'll do dp3(0:12, 0:n3-1) or we can do dp3(0:n3-1, 0:12). Let me follow the original: we'll have the first index as the step (from 0 to n3-1) and the second as the remainder (0:12).\n\n          But note: the original dp array: dp[cs.length][13]. We have n3 steps (n3 = length of the string). We'll do:\n\n            dp3(0:n3-1, 0:12)\n\n          However, the original base starts at 1 and then base = base * 10 % 13.\n\n          We initialize:\n\n            base = 1\n            dp3(0, :) = 0   ! for the first step (i=0)\n\n          But note: in the original, for the first character (i=0) and pre=0, they add 1? Actually:\n\n            (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0))\n\n          So for i=0 and pre=0, the initial value is 1.\n\n          How do we handle?\n\n          We can initialize:\n\n            dp3(-1, pre) = 1 if pre==0, else 0? But we don't have index -1.\n\n          Instead, we can do:\n\n            We'll let our dp3 for step0 be computed from an initial state at step -1 that is [1 at remainder 0, 0 otherwise].\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i = 0 to n3-1\n              for rem = 0 to 12\n                 dp3(i, rem) = 0\n\n            Then for the first character (i=0) we consider:\n\n              if the character (at the last character of the string) is '?', then for each digit next from 0 to 9:\n                 rem_new = (base * next) % 13\n                 dp3(0, rem_new) += 1   (if the initial state is 1 at pre=0)\n\n              else:\n                 next = digit of the character\n                 rem_new = (base * next) % 13\n                 dp3(0, rem_new) += 1\n\n          But note: the original does:\n\n            dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0))\n\n          So for i=0, they do:\n\n            dp[0][ (base * next) % 13 ] += 1   (because pre must be 0)\n\n          Then for the next step, base becomes base * 10 % 13.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            base = 1\n            do i = 0, n3-1\n                char = s(n3 - i : n3 - i)   ! because the string is from left to right: the first character is at index 1, the last at index n3.\n\n                if (char == '?') then\n                    do pre = 0, 12\n                        do next_digit = 0, 9\n                            new_rem = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n                            if (i == 0) then\n                                if (pre == 0) then   ! only then we add 1\n                                    dp3(i, new_rem) = mod(dp3(i, new_rem) + 1, MOD3)\n                                end if\n                            else\n                                dp3(i, new_rem) = mod(dp3(i, new_rem) + dp3(i-1, pre), MOD3)\n                            end if\n                        end do\n                    end do\n                else\n                    next_digit = ichar(char) - ichar('0')\n                    do pre = 0, 12\n                        new_rem = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n                        if (i == 0) then\n                            if (pre == 0) then\n                                dp3(i, new_rem) = mod(dp3(i, new_rem) + 1, MOD3)\n                            end if\n                        else\n                            dp3(i, new_rem) = mod(dp3(i, new_rem) + dp3(i-1, pre), MOD3)\n                        end if\n                    end do\n                end if\n\n                base = mod(base * 10, 13)   ! note: mod 13\n\n            end do\n\n          But note: the original does not have a nested loop for pre when i==0? Actually, they do: they loop pre from 0 to 12. But in the case i==0, they only add when pre==0? So we can break out the pre loop and handle pre=0 separately? Or we can keep the pre loop and condition.\n\n          However, we can optimize: if i==0, then we only care about pre=0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can initialize an array `prev` of size 13 for the previous state (at step i-1). For step -1, we have:\n\n            prev(0) = 1\n            prev(1:12) = 0\n\n          Then for i=0 to n3-1:\n\n            current(0:12) = 0\n            if the character is '?' then\n                for each digit next_digit from 0 to 9:\n                    for each pre in 0..12:\n                        new_rem = (base * next_digit + pre) % 13\n                        current(new_rem) = (current(new_rem) + prev(pre)) % MOD3\n            else:\n                next_digit = ... \n                for each pre in 0..12:\n                    new_rem = ... \n                    current(new_rem) = (current(new_rem) + prev(pre)) % MOD3\n\n            Then set prev = current\n            base = (base * 10) % 13\n\n          Then at the end, we want prev(5) (because the original outputs dp[dp.length-1][5]).\n\n          But note: the original base is updated at the end of the loop.\n\n          This method uses two arrays of size 13 (prev and current). And we iterate over the string.\n\n          This is more efficient and avoids a 2D array of size n3 x 13 (which is acceptable because n3 is at most 10, but still).\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            MOD3 = 1000000007\n            base = 1\n            prev = [1, (0, i=1,12)]   ! size 13: prev(0)=1, others 0.\n\n            do i = 1, n3   ! we are going to process the string from the last character to the first? Actually, the string s is the one we have (without reversal). We need to take the i-th character from the end.\n\n            How to index the string? \n\n                original: for i=0, they take cs[cs.length-1-i]\n\n            We can define:\n\n                j = n3 - i + 1   ! in Fortran: the j-th character from the left? Actually, if we have the string \"1234\", and i=0 (first iteration) we want the last character '4'. So if we index the string from 1 to n3, then for step i=0 we want the character at position n3. Then for step i=1, we want position n3-1.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                do i_step = 0, n3-1\n                    pos = n3 - i_step   ! the position in the string from the left: the first character is at 1, the last at n3.\n\n            Then the character is s(pos:pos)\n\n          Steps:\n\n            current = [0,0,...,0] (13 zeros)\n\n            if the character is '?' then\n                do next_digit = 0, 9\n                    do pre = 0, 12\n                        new_rem = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n                        current(new_rem) = mod(current(new_rem) + prev(pre), MOD3)\n                    end do\n                end do\n            else\n                read the character: next_digit = ichar(s(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\n                do pre = 0, 12\n                    new_rem = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n                    current(new_rem) = mod(current(new_rem) + prev(pre), MOD3)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n            Then set prev = current\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n            Then next step.\n\n          Then after processing all characters, we output prev(5).\n\n   Step 9: Print prev(5)\n\n   But note: the original third program uses the modulus 10^9+7, which is the same as MOD3=1000000007.\n\n   We must be cautious: the modulus operations in the third program are modulo 13 for the remainder and modulo 10^9+7 for the counts.\n\n   Now, write the entire Fortran program.\n\n   We assume that the input n can be up to 100000, so we must allocate an array of size 100000 for the integers.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     - Read n\n     - Read n integers into an array\n     - Sort the array (using a quick sort routine we write)\n     - Compute c\n     - Convert c to string s1 (without spaces)\n     - Run the second program on s1 to get res2\n     - Convert res2 to string s2\n     - Run the third program on s2 to get res3\n     - Print res3\n\n   We'll write the program in Fortran 90 style.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious with the indices and with the modulo arithmetic.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n     program combined\n     implicit none\n\n     !

But it might be inefficient for already sorted arrays? But the problem does not specify the input. We can use Hoare's partition? But for simplicity, we use the above.\n\n But note: the original Java program uses `Collections.sort()` which is a stable sort? The quicksort we wrote is not stable. But for integers, stability is not an issue? And the problem only requires the same value of c.\n\n However, the algorithm for c: we sort the array and then traverse. The value of c depends on the sorted order? Yes, but the sorted order is well defined. Our quicksort sorts in non-decreasing order? Yes.\n\n But note: the Lomuto partition scheme we wrote uses the last element as pivot. This can be bad for sorted arrays. We can change to use a random pivot? But the problem does not specify performance. Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic sort? But Fortran standard does not have a sort intrinsic. However, some compilers have `qsort` but we are to write standard Fortran.\n\n Since the problem says n can be up to 100000, we need to avoid worst-case O(n^2) for sorted arrays. We can use a median-of-three or random pivot.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a heap sort or merge sort. But for simplicity, we can use a random pivot in quicksort.\n\n Let me modify the quicksort to use a random pivot to avoid worst-case behavior.\n\n We'll do:\n\n        recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n            integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n            integer :: i, j, pivot, temp, pivot_index\n            real :: r\n\n            if (low < high) then\n                ! Choose a random pivot index between low and high\n                call random_number(r)\n                pivot_index = low + floor(r * (high - low + 1))\n                ! Swap arr(pivot_index) with arr(high)\n                temp = arr(pivot_index)\n                arr(pivot_index) = arr(high)\n                arr(high) = temp\n\n                pivot = arr(high)\n                i = low - 1\n                do j = low, high-1\n                    if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                        i = i + 1\n                        temp = arr(i)\n                        arr(i) = arr(j)\n                        arr(j) = temp\n                    end if\n                end do\n                temp = arr(i+1)\n                arr(i+1) = arr(high)\n                arr(high) = temp\n\n                call quicksort(arr, low, i)\n                call quicksort(arr, i+2, high)\n            end if\n        end subroutine\n\n But note: we must initialize the random seed? However, we are not required to have the same sort as Java, only the same c. And the array can be sorted arbitrarily as long as it is in non-decreasing order? Yes. But the algorithm for c is independent of the stability? Yes.\n\n However, the random number might cause different runs to sort differently? But the set of numbers is the same. The condition for c: we traverse in increasing order. So any non-decreasing sort will yield the same c.\n\n Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". The Java sort is a stable sort? The quicksort we wrote is not stable. But since we are sorting integers, stability is not an issue.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a merge sort? But that would be more code.\n\n We'll use the random pivot quicksort.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the input size. We assume that the input n can be up to 100000.\n\n But note: the worst-case recursion depth might be O(n) and cause stack overflow. We can do iterative quicksort? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic sort from the Fortran standard library? But the problem says to write a single program without external libraries.\n\n We'll write the quicksort with random pivot and hope that the input is not worst-case for the random pivot.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a heap sort to avoid recursion and worst-case O(n log n). But heap sort is longer.\n\n Considering the constraints (n up to 100000) and that we are using random pivot, it is acceptable.\n\n But note: the original Java program uses a dual-pivot quicksort for primitive arrays? Which is efficient.\n\n We'll write the quicksort with random pivot.\n\n Steps:\n\n   - We need to initialize the random seed? Actually, we don't care about the exact order as long as it's sorted. But we want to avoid worst-case. The random pivot is chosen randomly, so we don't need to seed explicitly? Fortran's `random_number` uses an implementation-defined seed. But that is acceptable.\n\n   - However, if we run the program multiple times, the sort might be different? But the value of c is the same for any non-decreasing sort. So it's fine.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a fixed pivot strategy (like median of three) without randomness? But we do random for simplicity.\n\n   But note: we don't want the program to run slowly on sorted arrays. Random pivot will avoid the worst-case.\n\n   Let me write the quicksort.\n\n   However, we must note: the array indices in Fortran start at 1? Our array `arr` is allocated from 1 to n? Actually, we read into arr(1:n). So the quicksort subroutine is called with low=1, high=n.\n\n   We'll write accordingly.\n\n   But note: the random pivot index: we want an integer between low and high (inclusive). We do:\n\n        pivot_index = low + floor( rand * (high - low + 1) )\n\n   But note: `rand` is a real in [0,1). So we might get an index from low to high (if we do floor(rand*(high-low+1)) then we get an integer in [0, high-low] so then adding low gives [low, high]).\n\n   However, the `floor(rand*(high-low+1))` might be 0? Then pivot_index = low. And if rand is 1.0, then we get floor(1.0 * (high-low+1)) = high-low, so pivot_index = low + (high-low) = high.\n\n   So it is correct.\n\n   Now, we write the entire program.\n\n   Note: The second program: in the first part, if the character is not '0', then we set dp2(i,1) = ... but we leave dp2(i,0) untouched? But we initialized the entire row? Actually, we set the row from the previous step? But in the else part, we only set the [1] component? Then in the second part we add to both. So we must initialize the row for the current step? Actually, we set:\n\n        dp2(0,0)=1, dp2(0,1)=0.\n\n        Then for i=1 to n2, we set:\n\n            if (char=='0') then\n                dp2(i,0) = dp2(i-1,0)\n                dp2(i,1) = dp2(i-1,1)\n            else\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(...)   -> and we don't set dp2(i,0) in this branch? Then what is dp2(i,0)? It is uninitialized? \n\n        We must initialize the entire row for the current step to 0? Or we set both components appropriately.\n\n   Actually, in the Java code, the array is allocated with zeros. So we should initialize the entire row to 0? But then we set the components. However, we set the row from the previous row? But in the else branch we only set [1]. Then [0] remains 0? Then in the second part we add 2*dp2(i-1,0) to dp2(i,0) and 2*dp2(i-1,1) to dp2(i,1). So if the character is not '0', then:\n\n        dp2(i,0) = 0 + 2*dp2(i-1,0)\n        dp2(i,1) = (dp2(i-1,0)+dp2(i-1,1)) + 2*dp2(i-1,1) = dp2(i-1,0) + 3*dp2(i-1,1)\n\n   But in the Java code, the second part for non-zero:\n\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n   And they mod each time.\n\n   Therefore, we should initialize the current row to 0? Actually, no: because in the first part we set the row from the previous row (for '0') or set one component (for non-zero). But in the second part we are adding. So we must start from the value we set in the first part.\n\n   We did:\n\n        for the first part: we set the row to either (from the previous row) or set [1] and leave [0] as it was? But what was [0]? It was uninitialized.\n\n   So we should initialize the row for step i to 0 at the beginning of the loop? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n\n        dp2(i,0) = 0\n        dp2(i,1) = 0\n\n        then do the first part and then the second part.\n\n   But the Java code does not reset the row? It uses the row from the previous step? Actually, the array is allocated and then initialized only for step0. Then for step i+1, they set the row by the above computations.\n\n   How did they initialize the row for step i+1? They did not set to zero. They only assign to specific indices. So the rest remains 0? Because the array is allocated as new int[n+1][2] which initializes to zeros.\n\n   Therefore, we should set the entire row to 0 at the beginning of each i? \n\n   We'll do:\n\n        do i = 1, n2\n            dp2(i,0) = 0\n            dp2(i,1) = 0\n\n            if (str1_trimmed(i:i) == '0') then\n                dp2(i,0) = dp2(i-1,0)\n                dp2(i,1) = dp2(i-1,1)\n            else\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i-1,0) + dp2(i-1,1), MOD1)\n            end if\n\n            if (str1_trimmed(i:i) == '0') then\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i,1) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,1), MOD1), MOD1)\n            else\n                dp2(i,0) = mod(dp2(i,0) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,0), MOD1), MOD1)\n                dp2(i,1) = mod(dp2(i,1) + mod(2 * dp2(i-1,1), MOD1), MOD1)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the initialization by setting the row to zero at allocation? But we allocated with:\n\n        allocate(dp2(0:n2,0:1))\n\n   and then set dp2(0,0)=1 and dp2(0,1)=0. The rest is undefined? So we must initialize.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        dp2 = 0   ! after allocation, set all to zero? But note we set step0. So we can set step0 and then for i=1 to n2, set the row to 0 at the beginning.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        dp2 = 0\n        dp2(0,0) = 1   ! then reset step0\n\n   Then the above loop.\n\n   Now, write the entire code.\n\n   We'll also note: the third program part: we set base = mod(base * 10, 13). But note: base might be negative? We use mod with positive divisor, so it should be nonnegative.\n\n   We'll use the Fortran mod function which returns a nonnegative remainder for positive modulus.\n\n   Let me test the mod: mod(-1,13) is 12? But we are multiplying positive numbers. So base is initially 1, then 10, then 100 mod13 -> 9, then 90 mod13 -> 12, etc. So we are safe.\n\n   Now, we write the complete program.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious with the string indexing: in the second program, the string is processed from left to right? Yes, the Java program does:\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {  // n is the length of the string\n            if (s[i]=='0') ...\n\n        So we are processing the string from the first character to the last.\n\n   Similarly, the third program: we process the string from the last character to the first (by our index `pos = n3 - i_step`).\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   We'll compile and run with a sample input? But we are not able to run here.\n\n   We assume the logic is correctly translated.\n\n   We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the third program in the original uses base * next_digit + pre, then mod 13. We do:\n\n        new_rem = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n\n   But note: base * next_digit + pre might be large? We can do mod 13 at the end? Or we can do mod at each step? But since base, next_digit, pre are small (base mod13 is in [0,12], next_digit in [0,9], pre in [0,12]), so the maximum is 12*9+12 = 108+12=120, which is less than 13*10, so mod 13 is safe.\n\n   Now, the complete Fortran code."
