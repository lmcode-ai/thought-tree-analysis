  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The first program (atcoder_AGC033_A) computes the maximum distance from any '#' in a grid (using BFS) and outputs the maximum depth (steps).\n The second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) simply replaces commas in a string with spaces.\n The third program (codeforces_678_B) finds the next year that has the same calendar as the given year (same leap status and same day of the week for Jan 1).\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is to be executed in sequence: the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs an integer (ans), the second program expects a string (with commas) and replaces commas by spaces. The third program expects an integer (year).\n\n How do we chain?\n   Input for the entire sequence: \n      The first program expects: H, W and a grid of H lines of W characters.\n      The second program expects a string (which in the example is read by BufferedReader and then processed).\n      The third program expects an integer.\n\n However, the output of the first is an integer (ans) and the second program expects a string. We can convert the integer to a string and then the second program will replace commas in that string by spaces? But the integer output of the first doesn't have commas. Then the second program won't change anything? Then the third program expects an integer but the second program outputs a string without commas (same as the integer string). \n\n But note: the second program in the example reads a whole line and replaces commas by spaces. However, the first program outputs just an integer (without commas). So the second program will read the integer as a string (without commas) and output the same string. Then the third program reads an integer? \n\n However, the third program uses Scanner to read an integer. But in the chain, the output of the second is a string of an integer. So if we chain:\n\n   Program1: outputs \"3\" (for example)\n   Program2: reads the string \"3\", replaces commas (there are none) -> outputs \"3\"\n   Program3: reads the integer 3.\n\n But the third program is about years? It expects a year. So the input for the entire sequence must be the grid for the first program? And then the output of the first is an integer that becomes the input for the second? Then the output of the second is the same integer? Then the third program uses that integer as the year? \n\n However, the original programs are independent. The problem says: the entire sequence is executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n But the first program expects a grid and the second expects a string? How do we connect? The problem says: the entire sequence. So the input for the entire Fortran program is the grid (as the first program expects). Then the output of the first program (an integer) is passed as the input string to the second. The second program then outputs a string (the integer without any commas, so same as input string). Then the third program reads that string as an integer (the year) and then computes the next year with the same calendar.\n\n However, the third program then outputs a year.\n\n Therefore, the entire Fortran program will do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the grid (H, W and H lines) and compute the BFS maximum step (ans1).\n   Step 2: Convert ans1 to a string and then \"process\" it by replacing commas by spaces (which does nothing because there are no commas) -> same string.\n   Step 3: Convert that string to an integer (which is the same as ans1) and then use that as the year in the third program to compute the next year with the same calendar.\n\n But wait: the third program expects a year? And the output of the first is a number of steps (which could be 0, 1, 2, ...). Is that a valid year? The problem says the entire sequence is run on the same input. The original input for the first program is a grid. Then the chain runs:\n\n      Grid -> (first) -> integer A -> (second) -> string of A -> (third) -> integer A (as year) -> output next year.\n\n This does not make sense: the grid input is not a year? \n\n Clarification: The problem states: \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of each program is the input to the next. The input to the entire chain is the input for the first program. The output of the entire chain is the output of the last program.\n\n However, the three programs were originally independent and meant for different problems. The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" when run on the same input.\n\n But note: the input for the entire chain is the grid. The first program outputs the maximum steps (an integer). The second program takes that integer as a string and outputs the same integer (without commas). The third program takes that integer as a year and outputs the next year that has the same calendar.\n\n However, the third program expects a year (like 2016) and the output from the first program is a small integer (like 3). So the third program will run with year=3? That is acceptable? The check_leap function will work for any integer. But the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would run the first program and output 3, then the second program would output \"3\", then the third program would take 3 as the year and output the next year that has the same calendar as 3.\n\n The third program: \n   check_leap(3): 3 % 400 != 0, 3 % 4 = 3 !=0 -> not leap.\n   Then it starts from 4: \n        i=4: check_leap(4): 4 % 4==0 and 4%100!=0 -> leap -> add 366 -> 366 mod 7 = 366/7 = 52*7=364, so 2 mod7 -> not 0.\n        i=5: 365 mod7 = 1 -> total 366+365 = 731 -> 731 mod7 = 731-7*104=731-728=3 -> 3 mod7.\n        ... until we find a year when the total days from y+1 to that year is divisible by 7 and the leap status is same as the starting year.\n\n So the entire chain is defined.\n\n Steps in Fortran:\n\n   1. We must read the grid (H and W, then H lines) without any extra I/O in the middle.\n   2. Perform the BFS (first program) to compute ans1 (an integer).\n   3. Then we have to pass that integer to the second program: which means converting it to a string and then replacing commas by spaces. But since the integer string has no commas, we get the same string. Then we convert that string back to an integer for the third program? \n      But note: the second program outputs a string. The third program then reads that string as an integer. So in Fortran, we can skip the unnecessary step of converting to string and then back to integer? However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". But the second program does nothing. So we can just use the integer ans1 as the input for the third program.\n\n   4. However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\".\n\n   So we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle. Therefore, we will store the intermediate results in variables.\n\n   But the second program is a no-op? Then we can skip it? Actually, the problem says to translate the entire sequence. So we must include the step of processing the integer as a string? Even if it does nothing? \n\n   However, note: what if the integer has commas? Actually, the integer from the first program is printed as a decimal number without any commas. So the second program will not change it. Therefore, we can avoid the explicit conversion if we are sure. But to be safe and exactly follow the chain, we can:\n\n        Step 2: take the integer ans1 and convert to a string. Then we remove any commas? But the original integer string has no commas. Then we have a string without commas. Then we pass that string to the third program? But the third program expects an integer. So we convert that string (without commas) to an integer? \n\n   However, in Fortran, we can avoid the string conversion if we are just passing the same integer. But the problem says: the entire sequence. So we have to mimic the chain.\n\n   But note: the chain is defined by the programs. The second program is:\n\n        String a = br.readLine();   // reads the entire line (which is the output of the first program: a string of the integer without any commas, and no extra spaces? because the first program uses System.out.println(ans) which prints the integer and then a newline)\n        Then it replaces every comma by a space -> but there are none -> then prints the string.\n\n   So the third program then reads from standard input that string? How? It uses Scanner which by default uses whitespace as delimiter? So it would read the integer from the string? \n\n   Therefore, the integer is preserved.\n\n   Since we are writing one Fortran program, we can avoid the intermediate string conversion because it doesn't change the integer. So we can use the integer ans1 directly as the input for the third program.\n\n   But note: what if the integer is negative? The first program: the grid and BFS: H, W are positive, and the steps are nonnegative. So no negative.\n\n   5. Therefore, we can do:\n\n        integer :: ans1   ! result of the first program\n        ... compute ans1 from the grid ...\n\n        integer :: year = ans1   ! because the second program does nothing, so the year for the third program is ans1.\n\n   6. Then run the third program: given a year (year = ans1), find the next year that has the same calendar.\n\n   However, the third program in Java uses:\n\n        int y = in.nextInt();\n\n        then leap = check_leap(y)\n        then for i = y+1, ... until it finds a year i such that:\n            the total days from y to i (exclusive of y, inclusive of i? actually, note: from y+1 to i) is a multiple of 7, and the leap status of i is the same as y.\n\n        How the total days is computed? \n\n            for (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i)) {\n                    sum += 366;\n                } else {\n                    sum += 365;\n                }\n                if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                    if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                        print(i); break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        This is incorrect? Because the total days from y+1 to i is the sum of the days in years [y+1, i]. Then the day of the week for January 1 of the next year is shifted by (days mod 7). The condition is that the total shift mod7 is 0 so that the next year starts on the same day? And also the leap status must be the same so that the entire calendar is the same.\n\n        However, note: the starting year y: January 1 of year y has a day of the week. Then we are adding total days from y+1 to i. Then January 1 of year i+1? Actually, the program computes the next year that has the same calendar as y? \n\n        Actually, the calendar of a year is determined by the day of the week of January 1 and whether it is leap. So two years have the same calendar if they have the same leap status and the day of the week of January 1 is the same.\n\n        How do we compute the day of the week for January 1 of the next year? \n            For a non-leap year: 365 mod7 = 1 -> shifts by 1.\n            For a leap year: 366 mod7 = 2 -> shifts by 2.\n\n        The program is accumulating the total shift from the starting year (y) to the candidate year (i). It starts at y+1 and goes to i. Then the shift from y to i (the year i) is the total days from y+1 to i? Actually, from the beginning of y+1 to the beginning of i+1? \n\n        But note: the day of the week for January 1 of year y is fixed. Then the day of the week for January 1 of year y+1 = (day0 + 365 mod7) [if not leap] or (day0+366 mod7) if leap of y.\n\n        Then for the year y+2: we add the days of year y+1, and so on.\n\n        The program starts at year y, and then for the next year i (starting from y+1) we add the days of that year. Then after k years, the shift is the total days mod7. We want the shift to be 0 mod7 so that the day of the week is the same as the starting year y. And also the leap status of the candidate year i must be the same as the starting year y? Actually, the condition in the code is:\n\n            if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                    print(i);\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: the candidate year i is the current year we are at in the loop. The condition checks that the leap status of i is the same as the leap status of the starting year y. However, the calendar of a year depends on its own leap status and the day of the week of Jan 1. The condition for the same calendar is:\n\n            - The leap status of the candidate year i must equal the leap status of the starting year y.\n            - The day of the week of Jan 1 of the candidate year i must equal that of the starting year y.\n\n        How is the shift computed? The shift from y to i is the total days from y (exclusive) to i (exclusive)? Actually, from Jan 1 of year y to Jan 1 of year i? \n\n        The program adds the days for the years from y+1 to i. But that would be the shift from Jan 1 of year y to Jan 1 of year i+1? \n\n        Example: from y to y+1: we add the days of year y? Actually, the program starts at i=y+1 and adds the days of year y+1? Then at the first step (i=y+1) we are adding the days of year y+1 to get the shift for Jan 1 of year y+2? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Actually, the program does:\n\n            i = y+1: add the days of year y+1 -> then we get the shift for Jan 1 of year y+2? \n\n        We are looking for a year i (>= y+1) such that the shift from y to i is 0 mod7? and the leap status of i is same as y? \n\n        But note: the condition in the code checks the leap status of the candidate year i, not the leap status of the starting year? and compares it to the leap status of the starting year? That is correct.\n\n        However, the shift we are accumulating is from the starting year y to the candidate year i? Actually, the shift from Jan1, y to Jan1, i is the total days in the years [y, i-1]. But the program is accumulating the days in the years [y+1, i]. So that would be the shift from Jan1, y+1 to Jan1, i+1. \n\n        We want the shift from Jan1, y to Jan1, i? That would be the days from y to i-1.\n\n        The program is accumulating:\n\n            i = y+1: add days of i (which is y+1) -> then that is the shift from y to y+1? Actually, from Jan1, y to Jan1, y+1: that is the days of year y. But the program doesn't have the days of year y? \n\n        This suggests the program is not computing the shift for the candidate year i relative to y.\n\n        How about we reindex: \n            Let d0 = day of week of Jan1, y.\n            Then d1 (Jan1, y+1) = (d0 + days_in_year(y)) mod7.\n            Then d2 = (d0 + days_in_year(y) + days_in_year(y+1)) mod7.\n\n            For the candidate year i (so that Jan1, i is the same as d0), we require:\n\n                (d0 + total_days) mod7 = d0  => total_days mod7 = 0\n\n            where total_days = days_in_year(y) + days_in_year(y+1) + ... + days_in_year(i-1)\n\n        But the program is adding the days for the year i (which is the candidate year) and then checks the condition? \n\n        Actually, the program starts at i=y+1 and adds the days of that year. Then the total_days at i=y+1 is the days of year y+1, which is the shift from Jan1, y+1 to Jan1, y+2? \n\n        We need the shift from Jan1, y to Jan1, i: which is the days from year y to year i-1.\n\n        The program does:\n\n            for i from y+1 to ...:\n                if check_leap(i) then add 366 else 365   -> this is the days of the year i? but that is the year that is the candidate? Actually, we are adding the year that we are currently at? \n\n        The condition should be: the shift for the year i (meaning that we are at the beginning of year i) is the total days from y to i-1. \n\n        How to compute that? \n\n            total = 0\n            for j from y to i-1:\n                total += days_in_year(j)\n\n        The program is doing:\n\n            for i from y+1 upwards, and adding the days of the year i? That would be the days from y+1 to i? \n\n        Then the shift for the year i+1 is total? \n\n        But we want the shift for the year i? \n\n        Actually, the program is accumulating the shift for the next year? \n\n        The condition in the program: when the accumulated sum mod7 is 0, then the candidate year is i? \n\n        Then the shift from Jan1, y to Jan1, i+1 is the accumulated sum? \n\n        But we want the shift for Jan1, i to be the same as Jan1, y? \n\n        This indicates that the program is off by one.\n\n        However, the original program in codeforces_678_B is accepted on Codeforces? So it must be correct? \n\n        Let me check a small example: \n            Start at year y=2016 (leap year). The next year with the same calendar: 2044? \n\n        The program:\n\n            leap = check_leap(2016) -> true.\n\n            i=2017: \n                check_leap(2017)=false -> add 365 -> sum=365 -> 365 mod7=1 -> not 0.\n            i=2018: add 365 -> sum=730 -> 730 mod7=730-7*104=2 -> not 0.\n            i=2019: add 365 -> 730+365=1095 -> 1095 mod7=1095-1092=3? (1092=7*156) -> 3\n            i=2020: leap -> 366 -> 1095+366=1461 -> 1461 mod7=1461-1463? 7*208=1456 -> 5 -> not 0.\n            ... until i=2044? \n\n        Actually, 2016 to 2044 is 28 years? 28 is a multiple of 7? 28/7=4. And 28 years is a cycle? \n\n        How many days in 28 years? \n            In 28 years, there are 7 leap years? (if the period is 4 years) but 2000 was leap, 2004,2008,2012,2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040 -> 10 leap years? \n\n        Actually, 28 years: 7 leap years? (because 28/4=7) but note century? 2000 is divisible by 400? so it's leap. Then 2004,2008,2012,2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040 -> 10 leap years? \n\n        Then total days = 28*365 + 10 = 28*365+10 = 10220+10=10230 -> 10230 mod7: 7*1461=10227 -> 3 mod7 -> not zero.\n\n        So 2044 is not the same? \n\n        Actually, the calendar repeats every 28 years only if the 28 years contain exactly 7 leap years? But 2000-2028: 8 leap years? (2000,2004,2008,2012,2016,2020,2024) -> 7 leap years? because 2028 is not included? \n\n        The program is adding the days of the year i? and then checking at the end of the year i? \n\n        Actually, the condition: when we are at candidate year i, we have added the days for every year from y+1 to i. Then the shift from Jan1, y+1 to Jan1, i+1 is the total? \n\n        We want the shift from Jan1, y to Jan1, i? \n\n        shift_i = (days_in_year(y) + days_in_year(y+1) + ... + days_in_year(i-1)) mod7\n\n        The program is computing:\n\n            shift_i+1 = (days_in_year(y+1) + ... + days_in_year(i)) mod7\n\n        And then condition: shift_i+1 mod7==0? \n\n        Then the shift from y to i+1 is shift_i+1? \n\n        But we want the shift from y to i to be 0? \n\n        This suggests that the candidate year should be i+1? \n\n        However, the program outputs i? \n\n        Alternatively, the program might be computing the shift for the year i? meaning that after adding the days of year i, we are at the beginning of year i+1? and we want that to be the same as the beginning of year y? \n\n        Then condition: total shift mod7=0 and the leap status of the candidate year i must be the same as the starting year? \n\n        But the calendar of the candidate year i is determined by its own leap status and the day of the week of Jan1 of that year? The day of the week of Jan1 of year i is the same as the day of the week of Jan1 of year y? \n\n        How do we compute that? \n\n            day_i = (day_y + shift) mod7, where shift = total days from y to i-1.\n\n        The program is accumulating the shift from y+1 to i? which is the same as the total days from y to i without the year y? \n\n        So shift_i = (day_y + (total_days_from_y_to_i-1)) mod7 = (day_y + (shift_program - days_in_year(i) + days_in_year(y))? ) -> not matching.\n\n        Given the complexity and that the program is accepted, we assume the logic is correct and translate as is.\n\n        Steps for the third part:\n\n            function check_leap(y) -> logical\n            set leap0 = check_leap(y)   ! the starting year (which is ans1)\n\n            set sum = 0\n            i = y+1\n            do while (.true.)\n                if (check_leap(i)) then\n                    sum = sum + 366\n                else\n                    sum = sum + 365\n                end if\n\n                if (mod(sum,7) == 0) then\n                    if ( (check_leap(i) .and. leap0) .or. (.not.check_leap(i) .and. .not.leap0) ) then\n                        print *, i   ! and break\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n                i = i+1\n            end do\n\n   7. But note: the entire Fortran program must not do I/O in the middle. Therefore, the output of the entire chain is the output of the third program: the integer i (the next year with the same calendar).\n\n   However, the problem says: the last block (the third program) should handle producing output.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will read the grid for the first program.\n\n   Then compute the BFS for the first program to get ans1.\n\n   Then set the starting year for the third program to ans1.\n\n   Then run the third program as described.\n\n   But note: the third program might run for a long time? However, the period is at most 28 years? Actually, the calendar repeats every 28 years? But if the starting year is 3, then the next year might be 14 years later? \n\n   However, worst-case the period is 28? because the cycle of the leap years and mod7 is 28? \n\n   But note: the condition in the third program does not require that the leap status of the candidate year is the same as the starting year? Actually, it does: the condition:\n\n        if ( (check_leap(i) .and. leap0) .or. (.not.check_leap(i) .and. .not.leap0) )\n\n   So it will eventually find a candidate? \n\n   We'll do:\n\n        integer :: H, W\n        character, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: A\n        ... read H, W and grid ...\n\n        ! Then BFS: \n        !   We need a queue. We'll use two arrays: one for the current queue and one for the next? or we can use a list? \n        !   But Fortran doesn't have a built-in queue. We can use two arrays and manage the front and rear? \n\n        ! Alternatively, we can use a large array for the queue and use two pointers (front and rear). \n\n        ! Steps for BFS:\n\n        !   We'll have an array 'flag' (integer or logical) to mark visited.\n        !   We start by enqueueing every '#' at depth 0.\n\n        !   Then we traverse until the queue is empty.\n\n        !   We'll use an array for the queue: \n        !        integer, dimension(1000000, 3) :: queue   ! 1: y, 2: x, 3: depth\n        !        integer :: front, rear\n\n        !   We initialize front=1, rear=0.\n        !   Then for each '#' we do rear=rear+1, and set queue(rear,:) = [i, j, 0]\n\n        !   Then while front<=rear:\n        !        pop from front: y = queue(front,1), x=queue(front,2), depth=queue(front,3)\n        !        then front=front+1\n        !        then for each neighbor: if not visited and is '.' then mark, set depth+1, and set ans = depth+1, then enqueue.\n\n        !   Note: the Java program sets ans = depth+1 every time it enqueues a new node? That means the last enqueued node will have the maximum depth. So we can do the same.\n\n   However, the grid size: H, W up to? the Java program uses H, W without bounds. We'll assume up to 1000? But we can allocate arrays dynamically.\n\n   We'll read H and W.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        read*, H, W\n        allocate(character(len=1) :: A(H, W))\n        allocate(flag(H, W))   ! integer array for visited? or logical? in Java it's integer. We can use integer.\n\n        do i=1, H\n            read*, line   ! but Fortran doesn't read a string of length W? We can read a string of length W and then split?\n            do j=1, W\n                A(i,j) = line(j:j)\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        ! Initialize the queue and flag\n        integer, dimension(1000000, 3) :: queue   ! but the maximum size is H*W, so we can allocate with size H*W.\n        integer :: front, rear\n        front = 1\n        rear = 0\n        flag = 0   ! all zeros\n        ans1 = 0\n\n        ! dx, dy\n        integer :: dx(4) = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n        integer :: dy(4) = [0, 0, 1, -1]\n\n        ! Enqueue all '#' positions\n        do i=1, H\n            do j=1, W\n                if (A(i,j) == '#') then\n                    rear = rear + 1\n                    queue(rear, 1) = i\n                    queue(rear, 2) = j\n                    queue(rear, 3) = 0\n                    flag(i,j) = 1   ! mark visited? In the Java program, the '#' are already visited? and then we check for '.' neighbors. But the Java program marks the '.' neighbors as visited when enqueuing. The '#' are not marked in flag? Actually, the Java program does not mark the '#' as visited? \n\n                    But note: the Java program does:\n                        if (flag[y+dy[i]][x+dx[i]] == 0 && A[y+dy[i]][x+dx[i]] == '.') \n\n                    So the '#' are not visited? and we don't enqueue them again? because we check for '.'? \n\n                    But we start by enqueuing the '#'? and then we check neighbors: if the neighbor is '.' and not visited, then enqueue.\n\n                    So we do not mark the '#' as visited? Then we might revisit a '#'? \n\n                    However, the condition A[y+dy[i]][x+dx[i]] == '.' will skip the '#' neighbors? \n\n                    So we don't need to mark the '#' as visited? \n\n                    But what about a neighbor that is '#'? it will be skipped? \n\n                    Therefore, we don't need to mark the '#' initially. We only mark the '.' neighbors when we enqueue.\n\n                    So in Fortran: we do not mark the '#' in the flag array.\n\n        Then the BFS loop:\n\n            do while (front <= rear)\n                y = queue(front,1)\n                x = queue(front,2)\n                depth = queue(front,3)\n                front = front+1\n\n                do k=1,4\n                    ny = y + dy(k)\n                    nx = x + dx(k)\n\n                    if (ny>=1 .and. ny<=H .and. nx>=1 .and. nx<=W) then\n                        if (flag(ny,nx)==0 .and. A(ny,nx)=='.') then\n                            flag(ny,nx) = 1\n                            rear = rear+1\n                            queue(rear,1) = ny\n                            queue(rear,2) = nx\n                            queue(rear,3) = depth+1\n                            ans1 = depth+1   ! update the answer to the current depth+1\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end do\n\n        Then we have ans1.\n\n        Then we set year0 = ans1   ! for the third program.\n\n        Then we run the third program:\n\n            logical :: leap0, leap_i\n            integer :: total, i\n\n            leap0 = check_leap(year0)\n\n            total = 0\n            i = year0 + 1\n            do \n                leap_i = check_leap(i)\n                if (leap_i) then\n                    total = total + 366\n                else\n                    total = total + 365\n                end if\n\n                if (mod(total,7)==0) then\n                    if ( (leap_i .and. leap0) .or. (.not.leap_i .and. .not.leap0) ) then\n                        print*, i\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n                i = i+1\n            end do\n\n        The function check_leap:\n\n            function check_leap(y) result(leap)\n                integer, intent(in) :: y\n                logical :: leap\n                leap = .false.\n                if (mod(y,400)==0) then\n                    leap = .true.\n                else if (mod(y,4)==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0) then\n                    leap = .true.\n                end if\n            end function\n\n   8. But note: the grid indices in Fortran: we used 1-indexed? The Java program uses 0-indexed: \n        if (0 <= y+dy[i] && y+dy[i] <= H-1 && ...) \n\n        We are using:\n            ny = y + dy(k) \n            if (ny>=1 .and. ny<=H .and. nx>=1 .and. nx<=W) \n\n        This is 1-indexed? But our grid A is dimensioned (1:H, 1:W). And we read the grid into A(1,1) to A(H,W). \n\n        The Java program: \n            for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) { ... }\n\n        Our Fortran: \n            do i=1, H\n\n        So the same grid? \n\n        Also, the starting positions: in Java, the '#' at (i,j) for i in [0, H-1] and j in [0, W-1]. In Fortran, we are at (i,j) for i in [1, H] and j in [1, W]. \n\n        Therefore, the BFS should be equivalent.\n\n   9. Memory: the queue might be large: H*W. We set the queue array to have size H*W? \n\n        We can allocate: \n            integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: queue\n            allocate(queue(H*W, 3))\n\n        But we don't know the maximum size? It might be H*W. \n\n   10. Edge: if there is no '.' at all? then ans1 remains 0? Then the third program runs with year0=0.\n\n        The leap year for 0: \n            mod(0,400)=0 -> leap.\n        Then we start at i=1: \n            check_leap(1): 1 mod400 !=0, 1 mod4=1 -> not leap -> add 365 -> total=365 -> 365 mod7=1 -> not 0.\n            then i=2: add 365 -> total=730 mod7=2 -> not 0.\n            ... until we find the next leap year that is 4? and then ... \n\n        But note: the condition: when total mod7=0 and the leap status of i is the same as the starting year (which is leap). So we need a candidate year i that is leap? and total mod7=0.\n\n        It will eventually find 4? \n            i=4: leap? yes -> total = 365+365+365+366 = 1461 -> 1461 mod7 = 1461/7 = 208*7=1456 -> 5 -> not 0.\n\n        It might take a while? But the period is 28 years? \n\n        Actually, the year 0 is not a real year? But the program is mathematical. \n\n   11. We assume the grid is not empty? \n\n   Code structure:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n\n        ! ... variables ...\n\n        ! Read H and W\n        read(*,*) H, W\n        ! Allocate and read grid\n        allocate(A(H, W))\n        allocate(flag(H, W))\n        do i=1, H\n            read(*,*) line   ! but we need to read a string of length W? \n            !

But we don't know. \n\n        Actually, we can compute the maximum queue size: at most H*W? So we allocate:\n\n            allocate(queue(H*W, 3))\n\n        Then we do the BFS.\n\n        Then we set year0 = ans1\n\n        !

But note: the second program is omitted? We decided that it does nothing? So we skip the explicit conversion to string and back? \n\n   This is acceptable because the problem says \"behaves identically\". The second program in the chain does nothing to the integer. \n\n   However, if the integer had commas, the second program would remove them? But the first program outputs an integer without commas. \n\n   13. We must not output anything extra.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Important: the BFS in the first program: the Java program uses a queue that initially contains all '#' at depth 0. Then it traverses. The ans is the maximum depth encountered.\n\n   We do the same.\n\n   Let me test the BFS with a small grid.\n\n   Example grid:\n\n        2 2\n        .#\n        #.\n\n   Then we have two '#' at (1,2) and (2,1). Then we enqueue both at depth 0.\n\n   Then we pop (1,2,0): neighbors: \n        (0,2): invalid\n        (2,2): valid? and A[2,2] is '.'? -> no, because the grid at (2,2) is not read? Actually, the grid:\n\n            A(1,1)='.', A(1,2)='#'\n            A(2,1)='#', A(2,2)='.'?\n\n        The grid:\n            Row1: .#\n            Row2: #.\n\n        So (2,2) is '.'? \n\n        Then we enqueue (2,2) at depth=1? \n\n        Then we pop (2,1,0): \n            neighbors: \n                (3,1): invalid\n                (1,1): valid? and A(1,1)=='.'? -> yes, and not visited? -> enqueue (1,1) at depth=1.\n\n        Then we pop (2,2,1): \n            neighbors: \n                (3,2): invalid\n                (1,2): '#' -> skip (because we check for '.' and also it might be visited? but we mark only the '.' we enqueue? and (1,2) is '#' so not visited? but we skip because not '.'.\n                (2,3): invalid\n                (2,1): '#' -> skip.\n\n        Then pop (1,1,1): \n            neighbors: \n                (0,1): invalid\n                (2,1): '#' -> skip\n                (1,0): invalid\n                (1,2): '#' -> skip.\n\n        Then ans1 = 1? \n\n        The Java program: \n            The last enqueued node is (2,2) and (1,1) at depth=1? Then ans=1.\n\n        Then the third program: starting at year0=1? \n            leap0 = check_leap(1) -> false.\n            Then we start i=2: \n                leap_i = false -> add 365 -> total=365 mod7=1 -> not 0.\n            i=3: add 365 -> total=730 mod7=2 -> not 0.\n            ... until we find the next non-leap year such that the total shift mod7=0 and the year is non-leap? \n\n            Actually, the condition: when the total shift mod7=0 and the candidate year is non-leap (since leap0 is false). \n\n            The first candidate: \n                total = 365 * n = multiple of 7? \n                365 mod7=1, so we need n mod7=0? and the candidate year is non-leap? \n\n            The first time total mod7=0 is after 7 years? total=365*7=2555 -> 2555 mod7=0? \n                365*7=2555 -> 2555 /7 = 365 -> exact? \n            Then candidate year = 1+7 = 8? \n            And check_leap(8)=true? because 8 mod4=0 and 8 mod100!=0 -> leap? -> so condition fails.\n\n            Then next: add 365 for year 8? no, wait: we added years 2 to 8? \n\n            Actually, we are adding the year i in the loop? \n                i=2: add 365 -> total=365 -> mod7=1\n                i=3: total=730 -> mod7=2\n                i=4: total=730+366=1096 -> mod7=1096-1092=4? (1092=7*156) -> 4\n                i=5: 1096+365=1461 -> mod7=1461-1456=5\n                i=6: 1461+365=1826 -> mod7=1826-1820=6? (1820=7*260)\n                i=7: 1826+365=2191 -> 2191 mod7=2191-2184=7? 0? -> then candidate year i=7? \n                    and leap_i = check_leap(7)=false -> same as leap0? -> so output 7.\n\n            So the entire chain: input grid, output 7.\n\n        Therefore, we output 7.\n\n   Code:\n\n        We'll write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the grid reading: we read H and W, then H lines of W characters.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            2 2\n            .#\n            #.\n\n        Output: 7\n\n   But the original first program would output 1? and then the second program outputs \"1\", then the third program outputs 7? \n\n   So the entire chain outputs 7.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let's code.\n\n   Note: We assume the grid is not huge (H*W up to 10^6?).\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer :: H, W, i, j, k, front, rear, ans1, year0, total, i_year, ny, nx, depth, y, x\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: line_str\n        character, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: A\n        integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: queue\n        integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: flag\n        integer, dimension(4) :: dx = [1, -1, 0, 0], dy = [0, 0, 1, -1]\n\n   Steps:\n\n        read*, H, W\n        allocate(character(len=1) :: A(H, W))\n        allocate(flag(H, W))\n        allocate(queue(H*W, 3))   ! each row: [y, x, depth]\n\n        !

But the period is at most 28 years? So the loop will run at most 28 iterations? \n\n   Actually, the condition: the calendar repeats every 28 years? So we can break after at most 28 iterations? \n\n   However, the program does not know that. But worst-case 28 iterations is safe.\n\n   But what if the starting year is very large? The leap year rule is the same? \n\n   We'll assume it runs at most 28 iterations.\n\n   However, the example with year0=1: we found 7 in 6 iterations (from 2 to 7). \n\n   So we don't worry.\n\n   Let's write the complete code.\n\n   Note: We must declare all variables.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: H, W, i, j, k, front, rear, ans1, year0, total, i_year, ny, nx, depth, y, x\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: line_str\n        character, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: A\n        integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: queue\n        integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: flag\n        integer, dimension(4) :: dx, dy\n        logical :: leap0, leap_i\n        integer :: mod_result\n\n        !
