Actually: dp[0] is at index 0, then dp[1] = len[0], dp[2] = len[0]+len[1], etc.\n- Then for i from 1 to k-1 (0-indexed, so i=0 is already done) and for j from 1 to q:\n      dp[i*(q+1)+j] = dp[i*(q+1)+j-1] + dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)] * len[j-1]   (mod mod)\n\n- Then output dp[k*(q+1)-1] (which is the last element of the last row).

This is the element at the (q - j + 1)-th position of the previous row? Note: j goes from 1 to q, so q - j + 1 goes from q down to 1. We must be cautious: the dp array for the previous row has indices from 0 to q (q+1 elements). The index (q - j + 1) is in the range [1, q] (since j=1 -> q, j=q -> 1). But note: the first row (i=0) has been set for indices 0 to q: \n        index0 = 0\n        index1 = len0\n        index2 = len0+len1\n        ... \n        index q = len0+len1+...+len_{q-1} So when we access dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)], that is the cumulative sum for the first (q - j + 1) blocks?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. However, note that the second and third programs also read from standard input. But according to the instructions, only the first program should read input and only the last should produce output. Moreover, the intermediate steps should process without I/O.\n\nBut looking at the three programs:\n\n1. The first program (atcoder_ABC132_F) reads two integers (n and k) and computes a value which it prints.\n2. The second program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and prints the next character of the first character of the string.\n3. The third program (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string and prints \"Yes\" if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', otherwise \"No\".\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, the output of the first program (a number) becomes the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string. Similarly, the output of the second program (a character) becomes the input to the third? The third expects a string.\n\nThis chain does not seem to naturally connect because the data types are mismatched.\n\nBut let's reconsider the problem: we are to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. The original chain runs three separate programs, with the output of the first becoming the input of the second, and the output of the second becoming the input of the third.\n\nHowever, the first program outputs a long integer (the result of a dynamic programming computation). The second program expects a string. The third program also expects a string.\n\nThis implies that the output of the first program must be converted to a string to be fed to the second program. Similarly, the output of the second program (a character) is then fed to the third program.\n\nBut note: the second program only reads one line and then takes the first character of that line. It then prints the next character (so if the input is \"A\", it prints 'B').\n\nSo the chain:\n\nInput to the entire chain: the first program reads two integers: n and k.\n\nStep 1: The first program runs and outputs a single number (say, X).\n\nStep 2: The second program takes the string representation of X (without any extra spaces) and then outputs the next character of the first character of that string.\n\nExample: if X is 65, the string is \"65\". The first character is '6'. The next character after '6' is '7'. So it prints '7'.\n\nStep 3: The third program takes the string \"7\" (a single character) and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. It does not, so it prints \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire chain would output \"No\".\n\nBut note: the third program actually checks the entire string. However, the output of the second program is a single character. So the third program's input is a string of length 1. It will never contain both 'A' and 'B'? So it will always output \"No\"? \n\nHowever, we must be faithful to the chain.\n\nBut wait: the second program only outputs one character (without a newline? Actually, the second program uses `printf` with `%c`, so it outputs exactly one character. The third program then reads one token? Actually, the third program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). However, the input to the third program is a single character and no whitespace, so it will read that one character.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\nInput: two integers (n, k)\n\nOutput: the third program's output, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut note: the second program's output is a single character (without a newline). Then the third program reads a string from standard input. How is the input provided? It is the output of the second program. So the third program will read a string that is one character long.\n\nSo the overall Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read two integers (n and k) from standard input.\n2. Compute the value X as in the first program (using the same algorithm).\n3. Convert X to a string and take the first character of that string, then compute the next character (so if the first character is c, then the next character is CHAR(ICHAR(c)+1).\n4. Then, check if the string (which is just that single character) contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it is a single character, it cannot contain both. So the output will always be \"No\"? \n\nBut wait: what if the first character of the string representation of X is a multi-byte character? Actually, in Java, the `charAt(0)` gives the first UTF-16 code unit, but in Fortran we are dealing with single-byte characters (ASCII). Also, the problem is from AtCoder and the inputs are integers. The value X is computed modulo 1e9+7, so it is between 0 and 1e9+6. Therefore, the string representation of X is a sequence of digits (0-9). So the first character is a digit.\n\nThe next character of a digit: for example, if the digit is '0', then the next character is '1'; ... if the digit is '9', then the next character is ':' (since the ASCII after '9' is ':').\n\nSo the third program will see a string that is one character, which is either a digit (if we are in the range '0' to '8') or a colon (if the first character was '9'). In any case, it does not contain both 'A' and 'B'. So the third program will always output \"No\".\n\nBut note: the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. So we must compute the same way.\n\nHowever, let's check the first program: it computes a DP for a problem. We must implement that in Fortran.\n\nSteps for the first program:\n\n- Read n, k.\n- Break the range [1, n] into contiguous blocks where in each block [l, r], the value floor(n/i) is constant for i in [l, r]. The length of each block is (r - l + 1). We store these lengths in a list `len`.\n- Then, we have `q` = number of blocks.\n- We create a dp array of length k*(q+1). The dp array is indexed in a flattened 2D way: dp[i*(q+1) + j] for i in [0, k-1] and j in [0, q].\n- Initialize: for j from 1 to q: dp[j] = (cumulative sum of the lengths? Actually: dp[0] is at index 0, then dp[1] = len[0], dp[2] = len[0]+len[1], etc.\n- Then for i from 1 to k-1 (0-indexed, so i=0 is already done) and for j from 1 to q:\n      dp[i*(q+1)+j] = dp[i*(q+1)+j-1] + dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)] * len[j-1]   (mod mod)\n\n- Then output dp[k*(q+1)-1] (which is the last element of the last row).\n\nWe must implement this in Fortran.\n\nThen, we take the output (a long integer) and convert it to a string. Then take the first character of that string, compute the next character (by ASCII code plus one). Then check: if the string (which is now the single next character) contains both 'A' and 'B'? But note: the third program is given the entire output of the second program. The second program outputs one character. The third program then reads a string (which is that one character). Then it checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the string has only one character, it cannot contain both. So we can hardcode the third part to output \"No\", but we must be faithful.\n\nHowever, let's consider: what if the next character we computed is 'A'? Then the string is \"A\", which does not contain both 'A' and 'B'? It only contains 'A'. Similarly, if it's 'B', then only 'B'. So always \"No\".\n\nBut what if the string of the first program's output is empty? Then the second program would try to read the first character and get an exception? But the first program's output is at least 1 (if n>=1 and k>=1) because the dp array has at least one element? Actually, the dp array has k*(q+1) elements. The output is the last element. But if k=0? The problem states: k is at least 1? The original problem constraints: n and k are at least 1? So we don't have to worry.\n\nBut note: the second program: if the input string is empty, then s.charAt(0) would throw. However, the output of the first program is at least 0? And 0 as a string is \"0\", which is non-empty.\n\nSo we can safely assume the string representation of X is non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Compute the value X (as the first program does).\n3. Convert X to a string and extract the first character.\n4. Compute the next character in the ASCII sequence.\n5. Then, check: if this single character string contains both 'A' and 'B'? Since it has length 1, it cannot. So output \"No\".\n\nBut note: the third program does:\n\n   if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) then ... \n\nBut in Fortran, we can check if the string has both 'A' and 'B'? For a string of length 1, we can simply check:\n\n   if ( (c == 'A' .or. c == 'B') ... ) \n\nBut that is not the same. We need to know if it has at least one 'A' AND at least one 'B'. Since the string has one character, it can only be one of them. So the condition is false.\n\nSo we can just output \"No\".\n\nBut to be faithful, we do:\n\n   if (index(s, 'A') > 0 .and. index(s, 'B') > 0) then\n        write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n   else\n        write(*,*) \"No\"\n   end if\n\nBut note: the third program uses `out.println` so it outputs the string and then a newline.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n   write(*, '(a)') \"No\"\n\nBut wait: what if the next character we computed is a character that is not a digit? For example, if the first character of the string representation of X is '9', then the next character is ':'. Then we have a string \":\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B'. So always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire chain always outputs \"No\". But that seems odd. However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior.\n\nBut note: the first program's output is a number. The second program then takes the first character of that number (as a string) and outputs the next character. The third program then checks if that one-character string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it never does, the output is always \"No\".\n\nBut we must compute the first program's output correctly because the second program's input depends on it.\n\nSo we must implement the first program's algorithm in Fortran.\n\nSteps for the first program:\n\n   mod = 1000000007\n   Read n, k\n   l = 1\n   q = 0\n   We'll create an array for the lengths (we don't know the size in advance, so we can count the blocks first? Or we can use an allocatable array and reallocate? But in Fortran, we can precompute the number of blocks? Alternatively, we can first count the blocks.\n\nHow to compute the blocks:\n\n   l = 1\n   while l <= n:\n        t = n / l   [integer division]\n        r = n / t   [because for i in [l, r], n//i is t, and r is the maximum i such that n//i = t]\n        then the length of the block is r - l + 1\n        then set l = r + 1\n\nWe can count the number of blocks (q) and also store the lengths.\n\nThen we set:\n\n   dp is a 2D array? Or a 1D array of size (0:k-1, 0:q) or (0:k, 0:q)? The Java code uses:\n\n   dp = new long[k * (q+1)]   -> size k*(q+1)\n\n   Then for j from 1 to q: \n        dp[j] = len[j-1] + dp[j-1]   [but dp[0] is at index 0?]\n\n   Actually, in Java, the array is zero-initialized. So:\n\n        dp[0] = 0\n        for j=1: dp[1] = len[0] + dp[0] = len[0]\n        for j=2: dp[2] = len[1] + dp[1] = len[0]+len[1]\n\n   So we are building the cumulative sum for the first row (i=0) for j from 1 to q.\n\n   Then for i from 1 to k-1 (row i, where i=0 is the first row):\n\n        for j from 1 to q:\n            dp[i*(q+1)+j] = dp[i*(q+1)+j-1] + dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)] * len[j-1]   mod mod\n\n   Note: the index for the previous row is: (i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)\n\n   Why q - j + 1? This is the element at the (q - j + 1)-th position of the previous row? Note: j goes from 1 to q, so q - j + 1 goes from q down to 1.\n\n   We must be cautious: the dp array for the previous row has indices from 0 to q (q+1 elements). The index (q - j + 1) is in the range [1, q] (since j=1 -> q, j=q -> 1). But note: the first row (i=0) has been set for indices 0 to q: \n        index0 = 0\n        index1 = len0\n        index2 = len0+len1\n        ... \n        index q = len0+len1+...+len_{q-1}\n\n   So when we access dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1)], that is the cumulative sum for the first (q - j + 1) blocks? Actually, no: because the cumulative sum at index j is the sum of the first j blocks.\n\n   But note: the Java code for the first row sets dp[j] (for j from 1 to q) to the cumulative sum of the first j blocks.\n\n   So the element at index (q - j + 1) in the previous row is the cumulative sum of the first (q - j + 1) blocks? Actually, that index is in the range [0, q]. Specifically, the element at index (q - j + 1) is the cumulative sum of the first (q - j + 1) blocks? But note: the cumulative sum at index j is the first j blocks. Therefore, the element at index (q - j + 1) is the cumulative sum of the first (q - j + 1) blocks? Yes.\n\n   However, we must note: the dp array for the previous row is stored from index0 to index q (inclusive). The index we are accessing is (q - j + 1), which is between 0 and q? Actually, j from 1 to q: so (q - j + 1) from q down to 1. So we are not accessing index0 in the previous row? Only indices 1 to q.\n\n   Therefore, we can implement:\n\n   Let mod = 1000000007\n   Precompute the blocks and the lengths. We'll store the lengths in an array `lens` of size q.\n\n   Then, we create a 1D array `dp` of size (0: k*(q+1)-1) [but in Fortran, we can use a 1D array of size (0: k*(q+1)-1)].\n\n   Steps:\n\n      dp(0) = 0\n      do j = 1, q\n          dp(j) = lens(j) + dp(j-1)   [but note: in Java, the j-th element in the first row is stored at index j (0-indexed). But wait: in Java, the array is zero-indexed. So the first row is stored in positions 0 to q (q+1 elements). The first element of the first row (j=0) is at index0, which we set to 0. Then j=1: index1 = lens(0) + dp(0). But in our Fortran, we have stored lens in an array of size q. We can store lens(1) for the first block? Or we can store the blocks in order.\n\n   How we computed the blocks: we start with l=1, then get a block [l, r] with length = r-l+1. We store that length. Then set l = r+1. So the first block is the first element.\n\n   So in the array `lens`, the first element is the length of the first block.\n\n   Therefore, for j from 1 to q:\n\n        dp(j) = dp(j-1) + lens(j)   [but wait: j in the loop goes from 1 to q, and we want to use lens for the j-th block? Actually, the j-th block in order?]\n\n   But note: we stored the blocks in the order of increasing l. So the first block is the one with l=1, then the next, etc.\n\n   In the Java code: \n        for j=1: we use len.get(j-1) -> the first block.\n\n   So in Fortran, we can store the lengths in an array `lens(1:q)` (index from 1 to q). Then:\n\n        dp(0) = 0\n        do j = 1, q\n            dp(j) = dp(j-1) + lens(j)\n\n   Then for i = 1, k-1 (so we are now at row i, which is the (i+1)-th row, since we start at row0)\n\n        do j = 1, q\n            idx = i*(q+1) + j   [this is the linear index for the j-th element in row i]\n            term1 = dp(i*(q+1) + j - 1)   [the previous element in the same row]\n            term2 = dp( (i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1) )   [the element in the previous row at index (q - j + 1)]\n            dp(idx) = term1 + term2 * lens(j)\n            dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod)\n\n   But note: the Java code uses:\n\n        dp[i * (q + 1) + j] = ... \n\n   The array `dp` is 0-indexed. In Fortran, if we use a 1D array starting at 0, then:\n\n        dp(i*(q+1)+j)   -> but note: in Fortran, we can define the array with indices starting at 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use 0-based indexing in Fortran? Or we can shift.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let dp(0 : k*(q+1)-1)   [so the indices run from 0 to k*(q+1)-1]\n\n   Then:\n\n        dp(0) = 0\n        do j = 1, q\n            dp(j) = dp(j-1) + lens(j)\n\n        do i = 1, k-1\n            do j = 1, q\n                idx = i*(q+1) + j\n                prev_idx_same_row = idx - 1\n                prev_row = (i-1)*(q+1)   ! base of the previous row\n                col_in_prev = q - j + 1   ! which column in the previous row? This is an integer between 1 and q? \n                prev_idx_prev_row = prev_row + col_in_prev\n\n                dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)\n                dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        result = dp(k*(q+1)-1)   ! the last element\n\n   But note: the last element is at index = k*(q+1)-1? Because the array has indices 0 to k*(q+1)-1. The last element is at the highest index.\n\n   However, in the Java code: \n        System.out.println(dp[k * (q + 1) - 1]);\n\n   So the last element is at index = k*(q+1)-1.\n\n   Then we take that result and convert to a string.\n\n   But note: the result might be negative? But we are taking mod with 1e9+7, which is positive. So nonnegative.\n\n   Then, we convert the result to a string. How? We write the number to a string.\n\n   Then we take the first character of that string.\n\n   Then, we compute the next character: \n\n        c = first character of the string\n        next_char = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\n   Then, we have a string of one character: next_char.\n\n   Then, we check if this string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it has length 1, it cannot. So we output \"No\".\n\n   However, note: the second program outputs the next_char without a newline? Then the third program reads the entire line? Actually, the second program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which does not append a newline. Then the third program uses `in.next()` which reads tokens. How does the Scanner next() work? It skips whitespace and then reads the next token (until whitespace). But the input is one character and no whitespace. So the token is that one character.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n        Input: n, k\n        Compute result (as above)\n        Convert result to a string: str_result\n        c = str_result(1:1)\n        next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n        Then we have a string s = next_char (of length 1)\n        Check: if (index(s, 'A')>0 and index(s, 'B')>0) -> false, so output \"No\"\n\n   But note: the third program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" followed by a newline.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007_8\n        integer :: n, k, l, r, t, q, i, j, idx, prev_idx_same_row, prev_row, col_in_prev, prev_idx_prev_row\n        integer(8) :: temp, result\n        integer(8), allocatable :: dp(:)\n        integer, allocatable :: lens(:)\n        integer :: block_start, block_end, block_length, nblocks\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: str_result\n        character :: c, next_char\n        character(len=1) :: s\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n and k\n        read(*,*) n, k\n\n        ! Step 2: Precompute the blocks (to get the lengths and q)\n        ! First, count the number of blocks (q) and record the lengths.\n        ! We can do two passes: first count the blocks, then store the lengths.\n        q = 0\n        l = 1\n        do while (l <= n)\n            q = q + 1\n            t = n / l\n            r = n / t\n            l = r + 1\n        end do\n\n        ! Now we know q, allocate lens\n        allocate(lens(q))\n        l = 1\n        nblocks = 0\n        do while (l <= n)\n            nblocks = nblocks + 1\n            t = n / l\n            r = n / t\n            lens(nblocks) = r - l + 1\n            l = r + 1\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, allocate dp: from 0 to k*(q+1)-1\n        allocate(dp(0 : k*(q+1)-1))\n        dp = 0\n\n        ! First row (i=0): for j from 1 to q\n        ! dp(0) = 0\n        do j = 1, q\n            dp(j) = dp(j-1) + lens(j)\n        end do\n\n        ! For the next rows: i from 1 to k-1\n        do i = 1, k-1\n            do j = 1, q\n                idx = i*(q+1) + j\n                prev_idx_same_row = idx - 1\n                prev_row = (i-1)*(q+1)   ! base index for the previous row\n                col_in_prev = q - j + 1   ! column index in the previous row (from 0 to q, but note: we are accessing at this column index)\n                prev_idx_prev_row = prev_row + col_in_prev\n\n                ! dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)\n                temp = dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)\n                dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n                dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        result = dp(k*(q+1)-1)\n\n        ! Now, convert result to a string\n        write(str_result, '(I0)') result   ! But we don't know the length? We can use an internal file.\n\n        ! However, we need to take the first character. We can write to a character variable of sufficient length.\n        ! Let's use a character variable to hold the string representation.\n        ! Determine the maximum number of digits: up to 10 (because mod_val is 10^9+7, so result < 10^9+7 -> 10 digits)\n        block\n            character(len=20) :: str_temp\n            write(str_temp, '(I0)') result\n            c = str_temp(1:1)\n        end block\n\n        ! Now, compute next_char\n        next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n        s = next_char   ! now s is a string of length 1\n\n        ! Now, check if s contains both 'A' and 'B'\n        if (index(s, 'A') > 0 .and. index(s, 'B') > 0) then\n            write(*, '(a)') \"Yes\"\n        else\n            write(*, '(a)') \"No\"\n        end if\n\n        deallocate(lens, dp)\n\n        end program\n\nBut note: the above block for writing the integer to a string uses a fixed-length string. We can do that.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the integer `result` might be 0? Then the string is \"0\", then c='0', then next_char is '1'. Then s=\"1\", which doesn't contain A or B.\n\nAlso, note: the dp array might be huge? But k and q: what are the constraints? In the original problem, n up to 1e5, k up to 10? And q is about O(sqrt(n))? So q ~ 2*sqrt(n) ~ 632 for n=1e5. Then k*(q+1) is at most 10*633 = 6330, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the original Java program uses `long[] dp = new long[k * (q + 1)]`. So the same.\n\nBut in Fortran, we are using integers of kind 8 (for dp) to match Java long.\n\nAlso, the modulus is 1000000007.\n\nBut note: the multiplication `dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)` might be huge? We are taking mod at the end of the expression? But the intermediate might overflow the 64-bit integer? The modulus is 1e9+7, so the numbers are modulo 1e9+7. But the multiplication: lens(j) is at most n (<=1e5), and dp(prev_idx_prev_row) is modulo 1e9+7, so the product is at most 1e9 * 1e5 = 1e14, which fits in a 64-bit integer (max ~9e18). So we are safe.\n\nBut we do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp, mod_val)\n\nBut the Java code does:\n\n        dp[idx] = ( ... ) % mod;\n\n   So we should mod the entire expression.\n\n   However, note: we are adding two numbers: dp(prev_idx_same_row) and temp (which is a product). The sum might be huge? We do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + mod(temp, mod_val), mod_val)\n\n   But the Java code does:\n\n        dp[i * (q + 1) + j] = ... % mod;\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        temp = mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j), mod_val)\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n        dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n   Or:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j), mod_val ), mod_val)\n\n   But the original does:\n\n        dp[i * (q + 1) + j] %= mod;\n\n   So it mods the entire expression. So we should mod after the addition.\n\n   However, the intermediate product might be huge? We can mod the product first to keep numbers smaller.\n\n   Let me change:\n\n        temp = mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * int(lens(j), 8), mod_val)\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n        if (dp(idx) >= mod_val) dp(idx) = dp(idx) - mod_val   ! or mod function\n\n        But better to mod:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp, mod_val)\n\n   Since lens(j) is integer, we convert to 8-byte for multiplication? Actually, we can do:\n\n        temp = mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * int(lens(j), 8), mod_val)\n\n   But lens(j) is integer (4-byte), and dp is 8-byte. The multiplication will be done in 8-byte? Yes.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * int(lens(j),8), mod_val), mod_val)\n\n   But note: the modulus might be applied twice? It's the same modulus.\n\n   So to avoid large intermediates, we mod the product first.\n\n   Revised inner loop:\n\n        temp = mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j), mod_val)\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n        if (dp(idx) >= mod_val) then\n            dp(idx) = dp(idx) - mod_val\n        else if (dp(idx) < 0) then\n            dp(idx) = dp(idx) + mod_val\n        end if\n\n   But the numbers are nonnegative, so we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp, mod_val)\n\n   However, the modulus operation for large integers might be expensive? But we are in the range of 1e14, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n        dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   But note: if the sum is negative? The mod_val is positive, so mod should handle it? But the numbers are nonnegative. So we don't need to worry.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + mod( dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * int(lens(j),8), mod_val), mod_val)\n\n   However, the multiplication might overflow? The product of two numbers each up to 1e9+7 might be 1e18, which fits in int64? Yes, 1e9+7 is about 1e9, squared is 1e18, and int64 can hold up to about 9e18. So we are safe without modding the product first? But we are modding the product by 1e9+7, so the product mod 1e9+7 is at most 1e9+6, so then the sum is at most 1e9+6 + (previous value, which is mod 1e9+7) -> at most 2e9+13, which fits in int64. So we can do:\n\n        temp = dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)\n        temp = mod(temp, mod_val)\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + temp\n        dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n   This is two mods. But the original Java does:\n\n        dp[i * (q + 1) + j] = ( ... ) % mod;\n\n   So one mod. But the two mods are equivalent.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j), mod_val)\n\n   But then the multiplication might be 1e18, which is acceptable in int64? Yes, but we are adding then modding. The addition might be huge? The entire expression: \n        dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row)*lens(j)\n\n   The dp(prev_idx_same_row) is mod_val (about 1e9) and the product is up to 1e9 * 1e5 = 1e14, so the sum is about 1e14, which is acceptable for int64.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * int(lens(j), 8)\n        dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n   But note: we must convert lens(j) to 8-byte to avoid overflow in the multiplication? Because if lens(j) is large (like 1e5) and dp(prev_idx_prev_row) is 1e9, then the product is 1e14, which fits in int64. But if we don't convert, then the multiplication would be in 4-byte? No, because dp(prev_idx_prev_row) is int64, so the product will be int64.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        dp(idx) = mod( dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j), mod_val)\n\n   But wait: lens(j) is integer(4) and dp(prev_idx_prev_row) is integer(8). The multiplication will be done in integer(8). So it's safe.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        dp(idx) = dp(prev_idx_same_row) + dp(prev_idx_prev_row) * lens(j)\n        dp(idx) = mod(dp(idx), mod_val)\n\n   However, the Java code does:\n\n        dp[i * (q + 1) + j] = ... % mod;\n\n   So we are doing the same.\n\n   Now, the entire program.\n\n   But note: the first row: we are storing the cumulative sums without mod? The cumulative sum might be huge? The cumulative sum of the lengths (which are the block lengths) is n (because the blocks cover [1, n]). n up to 1e5, so the cumulative sum is at most 1e5, which is less than mod_val. So we don't need mod for the first row.\n\n   However, we do:\n\n        dp(j) = dp(j-1) + lens(j)\n\n   and we are storing as int64. So it's safe.\n\n   Now, let's code accordingly.\n\n   One more issue: the indices for the previous row: we access at index = (i-1)*(q+1) + (q - j + 1). But note: the array dp is 0-indexed. The index (q - j + 1) must be between 0 and q? Actually, j from 1 to q, so (q - j + 1) from q down to 1. So we are accessing indices from 1 to q in the previous row. But the previous row has indices from 0 to q. So it's valid.\n\n   However, note: the first row: we set indices 0 to q. The element at index0 is 0, then index1 is the first cumulative sum, ... index q is the total cumulative sum.\n\n   So when j=1, we access the previous row at index (q - 1 + 1) = q -> which is the last element of the first row? That is the total cumulative sum? Then j=2: index q-1, and so on.\n\n   This matches the Java code: \n        dp[(i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1]\n\n   Therefore, the code.\n\n   Let me write the entire program.\n\n   Note: we must be cautious with the block counting: the first pass we count q, then we allocate lens(q). Then the second pass we fill lens(1:q). Then we use the same q in the dp array.\n\n   But note: the first pass and the second pass must give the same q.\n\n   We can avoid two passes by storing the blocks in a dynamic structure? But in Fortran, we can pre-count.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do one pass to store the lengths in an array and then use the count. But we don't know the size in advance? We can use a large enough array? Since q is about 2*sqrt(n) and n<=1e5, then q <= 700. So we can allocate an array of size 700 initially? Or we can do:\n\n        integer, allocatable :: lens(:)\n        integer :: max_blocks = 1000\n        allocate(lens(max_blocks))\n        nblocks = 0\n        l = 1\n        do while (l <= n)\n            nblocks = nblocks + 1\n            if (nblocks > max_blocks) then ... but we know the maximum is about 2*sqrt(n) ~ 632, so 1000 is safe.\n\n        then set q = nblocks, and then we can reallocate lens to q? Or just use the array of size max_blocks and then q = nblocks.\n\n   But we did two passes: the first to count, then the second to fill. That is acceptable.\n\n   Code:\n\n        q = 0\n        l = 1\n        do while (l <= n)\n            q = q + 1\n            t = n / l\n            r = n / t\n            l = r + 1\n        end do\n\n        ! Then allocate lens with size q\n        allocate(lens(q))\n\n        ! Then reinitialize l=1 and do the same to fill lens\n        l = 1\n        do i = 1, q\n            t = n / l\n            r = n / t\n            lens(i) = r - l + 1\n            l = r + 1\n        end do\n\n   But note: the first pass leaves l at a value > n. Then the second pass starts with l=1 again.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Now, we write the entire program.\n\n   One more note: the modulus value mod_val = 1000000007_8 (as an 8-byte integer).\n\n   And we must use 8-byte integers for dp and for the multiplications.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Also, note: the dp array might be large? k*(q+1) is about 10*633 = 6330, which is acceptable.\n\n   Finally, the output of the chain is always \"No\", so we could just output \"No\". But the problem says to compute the entire chain.\n\n   Therefore, we write the full computation.\n\n   Here is the final Fortran code:\n\n   (Note: I used a block for the string conversion to avoid having to allocate a big string globally)"
