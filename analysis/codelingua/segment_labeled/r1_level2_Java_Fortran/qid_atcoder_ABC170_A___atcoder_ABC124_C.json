However, the first program outputs an integer.\n\n How the original chain works?\n  The problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n  But the first program outputs an integer (say 4) and the second program expects a string (like \"0000\" or \"1010\")? \n\n  This mismatch suggests that the problem might have intended to run the two programs independently? \n  However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n  Let me reexamine:\n\n  The first program (ABC170_A) is:\n      Input: a list of integers (as a string) and we break at the first zero and output the count (starting at 1 until the zero).\n\n  The second program (ABC124_C) is:\n      Input: a string of '0's and '1's (without spaces).\n\n  How can the output of the first (an integer) be the input to the second? \n\n  Example:\n      Input to the first program: \"1 2 3 0 4\" -> outputs 4 (as an integer).\n      Then the second program would take the string \"4\" (which is a single character) and then process it? \n\n  But the second program expects a string of arbitrary length of '0' and '1'. \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire chain starts with the same initial input? \n\n  However, the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  This indicates that the output of the first program (which is the integer) is the input to the second program.\n\n  But the second program requires a string of 0/1. We must convert the integer to a string? \n\n  However, the first program's output is an integer, and the second program reads a string. In the chain, the second program would read the integer as a string.\n\n  Example: \n      First program: input \"1 2 3 0 4\" -> outputs \"4\\n\" (as a string of two characters: '4' and newline).\n      Then the second program would read that as the string? But note that the second program reads one token (using next()).\n\n  In the second program, the InputReader's next() method reads tokens. So if we have \"4\\n\", then the token would be \"4\".\n\n  Then the second program would process the string \"4\". How?\n      It would check the string of length 1? Then the loops (for a string of length 1) would run from 1 to 0 (so no iteration) and then from 0 to 0? \n      Then both a1 and a2 would be 0, and output 0.\n\n  But that doesn't make sense with the original problem of coloring tiles.\n\n  Alternatively, the two programs might be independent? But the problem says \"sequence\".\n\n  After reading the problem statements of the original contests:\n\n  ABC170_A: Five Variables. The problem: we have five variables x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. We are given the values and we break at the first zero and output the index (from 1 to 5).\n\n  ABC124_C: Coloring Colorfully. The problem: we have a string of 0 and 1 representing tiles. We want the minimum flips so that adjacent tiles are alternating.\n\n  There is no inherent connection. \n\n  Therefore, I suspect that the example provided might have two separate programs that are to be chained arbitrarily? \n\n  But the instruction says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n  And the behavior is: \n      Input (for the entire chain) is the input for the first program (a line of space separated integers) and the output of the chain is the output of the last program (an integer).\n\n  How the chain works:\n      Step 1: Run program 1 -> output an integer (say N).\n      Step 2: Run program 2 with input the string representation of N.\n\n  So the entire Fortran program should:\n      - Read the initial input (a line of space separated integers) and compute the integer N (the position of the first zero).\n      - Then convert that integer N to a string (without spaces and without newline) to use as the input for the second program.\n      - Then the second program will process that string (which is the digits of N) and output the minimum number of flips to make adjacent characters different.\n\n  Example:\n      Input: \"1 2 0 3 4\"\n        Program1: finds the first zero at the third number -> outputs 3.\n        Then the string for program2 is \"3\" (a single character).\n\n      For the string \"3\": \n        The second program does:\n          Option 1: from left to right: \n            string \"3\" -> no adjacent pairs? so a1=0.\n          Option 2: from right to left: \n            same, no adjacent pairs? so a2=0.\n          Then output 0.\n\n  But note: the second program is designed for a string of '0' and '1'. However, the string we pass is the digit '3'. \n  The program will still run: it compares the characters regardless of being '0' or '1'. \n\n  However, the original problem of Coloring Colorfully expects only 0 and 1. But the program code doesn't check that. It just flips when two adjacent are same.\n\n  But the flipping condition: \n      In the first pass:\n          for i from 1 to len-1:\n            if current char equals the previous, then flip the current (by setting it to the opposite of what it was? but note: it sets to the opposite of the current? \n            Actually, the code: \n                if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n                    if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n                    else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n                    a1++;\n                }\n\n          This flips the current tile to break the equality with the previous.\n\n      Similarly, the second pass from right to left flips the left tile when adjacent are equal.\n\n  However, when the string contains digits other than '0' and '1', the flip condition is set to flip to either '0' or '1'. \n  But note: the flip is determined by the current character: if it's '1', set to '0'; otherwise set to '1'. \n  So for the character '3', it would set to '1'. \n\n  This might not be what we want? But the problem statement of the second program is about 0 and 1. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original Java chain would do exactly that: it would run the second program on the string \"3\".\n\n  Therefore, we must simulate the same.\n\n  Plan for Fortran:\n\n  1. Read the first input: a line of space separated integers (we don't know how many, but the first program breaks at the first zero and counts the position).\n  2. We'll read the entire line and split by spaces to get tokens. Then we traverse the tokens until we find one that is \"0\". The position (starting at 1) is the result (N).\n\n  3. Convert N to a string. For example, if N is 3, we get the string \"3\".\n\n  4. Then we run the second program's logic on this string.\n\n  5. The second program has two passes:\n        Pass 1: traverse from left to right (from index 2 to the end in 1-indexing). \n                If the current character equals the previous, then flip the current (and count a flip) to the opposite (if it's '1' then set to '0'; else set to '1').\n        Pass 2: traverse from right to left (from the last character down to the second). \n                If the current character equals the next (to the left), then flip the left one (and count a flip).\n\n        Then take the minimum of the two counts.\n\n  6. Output that minimum.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n  - We must read the first line and split into tokens (without knowing the maximum number of tokens). In Fortran, we can read the entire line and then parse.\n\n  - The first program: the input tokens are integers, but we read them as strings. We are only interested in the first zero.\n\n  - How to split the line? We can use Fortran's internal reads and list-directed input? Or we can read the entire line and then split by spaces.\n\n  - We assume the input tokens are separated by one or more spaces.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  Step 1: Read the entire line.\n\n  Step 2: Split the line into tokens (array of strings). We can use a loop and adjustl, adjustr, and index of space.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the fact that the tokens are integers? But the first program reads them as strings.\n\n  We'll split the line into tokens and store them in a string array. We don't know the maximum number of tokens, but the problem ABC170_A has five variables. \n  However, the problem does not specify the maximum. But note: the first program breaks at the first zero and then stops. So we can break when we find a token that is \"0\".\n\n  How to split: we can use a loop that scans for non-space and then space.\n\n  We'll set a maximum length for the line? Let's assume 1000 characters.\n\n  Step 3: Traverse the tokens until we find \"0\". The count is the index (starting at 1) of that token.\n\n  Step 4: Convert the count to a string. For example, if the count is 123, then we get the string \"123\".\n\n  Step 5: Process the string from step 4 for the second program.\n\n  Step 6: Output the result of the second program.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: The second program in Java flips the tiles in two different ways and then takes the minimum. We must do the same.\n\n  However, note: the second program uses two separate passes and two separate StringBuilders. We can do similarly in Fortran by having two copies of the string.\n\n  But note: the second pass in the Java program modifies the left tile when two adjacent are the same? Actually, it goes from the end to the beginning (i from len-1 down to 1) and then compares the current (i) and the left (i-1). If they are equal, it flips the left one (at i-1). \n\n  We must be cautious: Fortran strings are 1-indexed.\n\n  Steps for the second part:\n\n  Let s be the string we got from converting the integer.\n\n  We create two copies: s1 and s2.\n\n  For the first pass (forward):\n      count1 = 0\n      do i = 2, len(s1)\n          if (s1(i) == s1(i-1)) then\n              if (s1(i) == '1') then\n                  s1(i) = '0'\n              else\n                  s1(i) = '1'\n              end if\n              count1 = count1 + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n  For the second pass (backward):\n      count2 = 0\n      do i = len(s2), 2, -1\n          if (s2(i) == s2(i-1)) then\n              if (s2(i-1) == '1') then\n                  s2(i-1) = '0'\n              else\n                  s2(i-1) = '1'\n              end if\n              count2 = count2 + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n  Then the result is min(count1, count2)\n\n  But note: the second program in Java for the backward pass flips the left tile (i-1) and then continues. \n\n  However, in the backward pass, we are going from the end to the beginning. After flipping the left tile, the tile that is left (at i-1) might then become equal to the tile at i-2? But the loop continues to the left. \n\n  This is the same as the Java code: the loop index is decreasing, so the next comparison will be at i-1 and i-2.\n\n  But in the forward pass, we flip the current tile (at i) and then the next comparison is i and i+1? The flip at i might then cause a new conflict at i and i+1? \n\n  The Java code does not try to avoid that? Actually, it is intended to fix the current conflict and then move on. The next comparison is independent.\n\n  However, note: the forward pass flips the current tile, which then becomes the previous for the next tile. So the next tile might see the flip we just did.\n\n  Example: \"00\"\n      i=2: compare s1(1) and s1(2): both '0'. Then flip s1(2) to '1'. Now the string becomes \"01\". \n      Then for i=3? (if any) we would compare s1(2) and s1(3). \n\n  This is the same as the Java code.\n\n  Similarly, the backward pass: \n      \"00\": \n          i=2: compare s2(2) and s2(1): both '0'. Then flip s2(1) to '1'. Then the string becomes \"10\". \n\n  So we are doing the same.\n\n  Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the string we are processing is the string representation of the integer (which may be multiple digits). The digits can be any of the characters from '0' to '9'. \n\n  The flipping rule: \n      if the character is '1', we flip to '0'\n      otherwise (any other character) we flip to '1'\n\n  This is what the Java code does.\n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read the entire input line (with a maximum length, say 1000 characters).\n\n  2. Split the line into tokens (by spaces). We'll use a list of tokens and a counter.\n\n  3. Traverse the tokens until we find a token that is \"0\". The position (starting at 1) is the integer result.\n\n  4. Convert the integer to a character string. We can use internal write.\n\n  5. Then run the two passes on that string.\n\n  6. Print the minimum of the two counts.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  We'll assume the input line is not longer than 1000 characters and has at most 100 tokens.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Note: Fortran requires explicit variable declarations and fixed-size arrays. We'll set:\n\n      character(len=1000) :: line, token\n      character(len=10), dimension(100) :: tokens  ! each token max 10 characters? actually the tokens are single digits? but let's be safe: 10.\n      integer :: n_tokens = 0\n      integer :: i, j, pos\n      integer :: count1, count2\n      character(len=20) :: s  ! to hold the integer string (20 is enough for an integer)\n      character(len=20) :: s1, s2\n\n  Steps for splitting:\n\n      read(*, '(a)') line   ! read the entire line\n\n      i = 1\n      token = ''\n      n_tokens = 0\n      do while (len_trim(line) > 0)\n          ! Skip leading spaces\n          j = verify(line, ' ')\n          if (j == 0) exit\n          line = line(j:)\n          j = scan(line, ' ')\n          if (j == 0) then\n              token = line\n              line = ''\n          else\n              token = line(1:j-1)\n              line = line(j+1:)\n          end if\n          n_tokens = n_tokens + 1\n          tokens(n_tokens) = token\n          ! Check if this token is \"0\"\n          if (token == '0') then\n              pos = n_tokens\n              exit   ! break at the first zero, but note: the problem says break at the first zero and then output the position (which is the count at that time). \n                     ! However, we are breaking the splitting loop? But we have found the first zero. The rest is not needed? \n                     ! But the problem: the first program breaks the loop after the first zero. So we break the splitting loop at the first zero? \n          end if\n      end do\n\n      If we didn't find a zero, then pos would be n_tokens? But the problem says there is at least one zero? \n\n      Actually, the first program: \n          for (String str : input_array) {\n              result += 1;\n              if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n          }\n      So if we don't break, then we go through all tokens? Then the result would be the total number of tokens? \n\n      But the problem states: we break at the first zero. So we must break at the first zero.\n\n      Therefore, we break the splitting loop at the first zero? But note: we are reading tokens one by one. We break when we find a token that is \"0\", and then we set pos = n_tokens and break the loop.\n\n      Then the integer we want is n_tokens (because we break at the first zero, and we have counted that token as the last one).\n\n      But note: the first program counts until the token that is zero. For example:\n\n          tokens: \"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\" -> we break at the third token (which is \"0\") and then the result is 3.\n\n      So we set: pos = n_tokens   (because we break immediately after adding the token \"0\", so n_tokens is the position of the zero).\n\n      However, if we don't break? Then we go through all tokens and then the result would be the total number of tokens? And the problem says there is at least one zero? \n\n      So we don't have to worry.\n\n      But the problem says: break at the first zero. So we break the splitting loop as soon as we find the token \"0\".\n\n      But what if we have multiple zeros? We break at the first.\n\n      Therefore, after the splitting loop, we have the position in the variable 'pos'. Actually, we set pos = n_tokens when we break. \n\n      Then the integer we want is pos.\n\n  4. Convert the integer pos to a string:\n\n      write(s, '(I0)') pos   ! This writes the integer without any extra spaces.\n\n  5. Then we have the string s.\n\n  6. Now we run the two passes.\n\n      Let n = len_trim(s)   ! the length of the string without trailing blanks.\n\n      But note: the string s might have leading spaces? No, because we used I0.\n\n      Then we set:\n\n          s1 = s(1:n)   ! we are going to use the first n characters for s1 and s2? Actually, we need to work on the entire string? \n          s2 = s(1:n)\n\n      But our loops will be from 2 to n (for the forward) and from n down to 2 (for the backward).\n\n      However, note: we have to consider the entire string of n characters.\n\n      Forward pass:\n\n          count1 = 0\n          do i = 2, n\n              if (s1(i:i) == s1(i-1:i-1)) then\n                  if (s1(i:i) == '1') then\n                      s1(i:i) = '0'\n                  else\n                      s1(i:i) = '1'\n                  end if\n                  count1 = count1 + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n      Backward pass:\n\n          count2 = 0\n          do i = n, 2, -1\n              if (s2(i:i) == s2(i-1:i-1)) then\n                  ! flip the left one (at i-1)\n                  if (s2(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                      s2(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n                  else\n                      s2(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n                  end if\n                  count2 = count2 + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n  7. Then result = min(count1, count2)\n\n  8. Print the result.\n\n  However, note: the second program in Java uses the entire string (including the trailing newline? but the InputReader reads tokens without newline). \n\n  We are using the string without any newline.\n\n  But the Java program for the second part: it reads the token by next(), which stops at whitespace. So we have the exact string without any newline.\n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  Let me test with the example: \n      Input: \"1 2 0 3 4\" -> we break at the third token (which is \"0\"). Then the integer is 3 -> string \"3\".\n\n      Then for the string \"3\": \n          Forward pass: \n              i=2: but the string length is 1 -> no loop -> count1=0.\n          Backward pass: \n              i=1 down to 2? no loop -> count2=0.\n          Then output 0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \"0 1 2\" -> we break at the first token -> pos=1 -> string \"1\".\n\n      Then for the string \"1\": same as above -> 0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \"1 0 2\" -> we break at the second token -> pos=2 -> string \"2\".\n\n      Then for the string \"2\": same -> 0.\n\n  But what if the integer has multiple digits? \n      Example: we have 10 tokens? Then the integer is 10 -> string \"10\".\n\n      Now the string \"10\": \n          Forward pass: \n              i=2: compare s1(1)='1' and s1(2)='0' -> not equal -> do nothing. count1=0.\n          Backward pass: \n              i=2: compare s2(2)='0' and s2(1)='1' -> not equal -> count2=0.\n          Then output 0.\n\n  Now, what if we have two consecutive same digits in the integer string?\n      Example: 11 tokens -> string \"11\"\n          Forward pass:\n              i=2: compare '1' and '1' -> equal -> flip the second to '0'. Now the string becomes \"10\". Then count1=1.\n          Then for the backward pass?\n              We start with the original string \"11\" (because we made a copy for s2).\n              i=2: compare s2(2) and s2(1): both '1' -> flip s2(1) to '0'. Then the string becomes \"01\". Then count2=1.\n          Then output min(1,1)=1.\n\n  This matches the Java program.\n\n  Therefore, we code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the first program might not break if there's no zero? The problem states there is at least one zero? \n\n  We'll assume that the input has at least one zero.\n\n  Code:\n\n  Let's write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  Note: We are reading the entire line and then splitting. We break at the first zero. We do not read beyond the first zero.\n\n  But the problem says: the first program breaks at the first zero. So we break the splitting loop at the first zero.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      character(len=1000) :: line, token\n      character(len=10), dimension(100) :: tokens\n      integer :: n_tokens, i, j, pos, count1, count2, n\n      character(len=20) :: s, s1, s2\n      logical :: found_zero\n\n      !

Skip leading spaces\n          j = verify(line, ' ')\n          if (j == 0) exit\n          line = line(j:)\n          j = scan(line, ' ')\n          if (j == 0) then\n              token = trim(line)\n              line = ''\n          else\n              token = line(1:j-1)\n              line = line(j+1:)\n          end if\n\n          n_tokens = n_tokens + 1\n          tokens(n_tokens) = token\n\n          if (token == '0') then\n              pos = n_tokens\n              found_zero = .true.\n              exit   ! break at the first zero\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! If we didn't break, then we didn't find a zero? But the problem says there is at least one zero.\n      ! So we assume found_zero is true. Otherwise, we set pos to n_tokens? \n      ! The first program: if no zero, then it counts every token? \n      if (.not. found_zero) then\n          pos = n_tokens\n      end if\n\n      ! Convert pos to string\n      write(s, '(I0)') pos\n\n      ! Now, we have the string s. Let n = len_trim(s)\n      n = len_trim(s)\n\n      ! If n is zero, then we skip the loops? but the integer must be at least 1? so n>=1.\n\n      ! Make two copies\n      s1 = s(1:n)\n      s2 = s(1:n)\n\n      ! Forward pass (left to right)\n      count1 = 0\n      do i = 2, n\n          if (s1(i:i) == s1(i-1:i-1)) then\n              if (s1(i:i) == '1') then\n                  s1(i:i) = '0'\n              else\n                  s1(i:i) = '1'\n              end if\n              count1 = count1 + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Backward pass (right to left)\n      count2 = 0\n      do i = n, 2, -1\n          if (s2(i:i) == s2(i-1:i-1)) then\n              if (s2(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                  s2(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n              else\n                  s2(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n              end if\n              count2 = count2 + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the minimum of count1 and count2\n      print *, min(count1, count2)\n\n      end program combined\n\n  However, note: the Java program for the second part uses two separate StringBuilders (a and b) and does the two passes independently. We do the same.\n\n  But note: in the backward pass, we are modifying s2. The forward pass modifies s1. They are independent.\n\n  Therefore, this should be correct.\n\n  Let me test with the example: \n      Input: \"1 2 3 0 4\" -> \n          tokens: \n              token1: \"1\" -> not zero -> n_tokens=1\n              token2: \"2\" -> n_tokens=2\n              token3: \"3\" -> n_tokens=3\n              token4: \"0\" -> found_zero, pos=4 -> break.\n\n          Then s = \"4\", n=1 -> then no loops -> min(0,0)=0 -> output 0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \"0\" -> \n          token1: \"0\" -> found_zero, pos=1 -> s = \"1\", n=1 -> output 0.\n\n      But wait: the integer 1 is represented as \"1\", which is one character -> no adjacent pairs -> 0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \"1 0 2\" -> \n          token1: \"1\" -> n_tokens=1\n          token2: \"0\" -> found_zero, pos=2 -> s=\"2\", n=1 -> output 0.\n\n  Example with two consecutive same digits in the integer string: \n      Input: \"1 1 1 1 0\" -> \n          tokens: \n            \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", then \"0\" -> pos=5 -> s=\"5\" -> n=1 -> output 0.\n\n      But wait: the integer is 5 -> string \"5\", so no consecutive same digits.\n\n      How about 11 tokens? \n          We break at the 11th token? -> s = \"11\" (which is two characters: '1' and '1').\n\n          Forward pass: \n              i=2: compare s1(2) and s1(1) -> both '1' -> flip s1(2) to '0'. Then count1=1.\n          Backward pass:\n              i=2: compare s2(2) and s2(1) -> both '1' -> flip s2(1) to '0'. Then count2=1.\n          Then output 1.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n  However, note: the Java program for the first part does not stop reading until the entire array is split? Actually, it splits the entire line. But we break at the first zero. \n\n  The original first program: \n      String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n      for (String str : input_array) {\n          result += 1;\n          if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n      }\n\n  This breaks the loop at the first occurrence of \"0\", but the entire line is split. We break the splitting loop at the first zero? \n\n  But note: the problem says \"break at the first zero\", meaning we stop the counting at the first zero. We don't care about the rest. \n\n  Therefore, we break the splitting loop to avoid unnecessary work? \n\n  Alternatively, we could split the entire line and then traverse the tokens? But the problem says there might be many tokens? \n\n  But since we break at the first zero, we don't need to split the entire line. \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the maximum number of tokens. We set a maximum of 100 tokens. \n\n  But if the first zero is at the 101st token? Then we break at 100 tokens without finding a zero? Then we set pos = 100? Then we break the splitting loop? \n\n  Actually, we break the splitting loop only when we find a zero. Otherwise, we split until the end of the line.\n\n  Our splitting loop condition: while (len_trim(line) > 0). \n\n  So we split the entire line? Then we set n_tokens to the total number of tokens. And if we didn't find a zero, then we set pos = n_tokens.\n\n  This matches the first program.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n  Let me write the complete Fortran code.\n\n  Note: We must declare all variables.\n\n  We'll set:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      character(len=1000) :: line, token\n      character(len=10), dimension(100) :: tokens\n      integer :: n_tokens, i, j, pos, count1, count2, n, min_val\n      character(len=20) :: s, s1, s2\n      logical :: found_zero\n\n  And then the code as above.\n\n  However, note: the variable 'min_val' is not needed, we can print min(count1, count2).\n\n  But let me use:\n\n      print *, min(count1, count2)\n\n  But Fortran's min function works for integers.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  But note: the Java program for the first part: if the input is \"0\", then the output of the first program is 1. Then the second program gets the string \"1\", and then outputs 0.\n\n  So the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n  We'll run the Fortran program with input \"0\", and it should output 0.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:"
