      "text": "However, the maximum k is len0, which is 200000, so building by concatenation in a loop (k steps, each concatenation of a string of length L and a character: O(L)) would be O(k^2) which is 40e9 operations? That is too slow. Therefore, we use the temporary array of characters and then build the string in one go. Steps for Step 2 (replace):\n\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n        allocate(character(len=len0) :: s0_transformed)   ! we will adjust the length later? Actually, we don't know the final length.

Now, we have s0_transformed of length k. Then we do the counting. However, note: the first program does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n            if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (s.charAt(i) == 'D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        cnt8 = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        do i=1, k\n            if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n   Note: tmp and cnt8 are integers. But the count can be large, so we use integer(kind=8) for cnt8? And tmp might be up to the number of consecutive A's, which is <=200000? So integer is enough for tmp? But we use integer for tmp? However, in the accumulation: cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp, and tmp can be 200000 and we do that for every D? The maximum D is 100000? Then the maximum cnt8 is 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer? But 20e9 is 2e10, which is about 20 billion -> 2e10, which is less than 2^35 (about 34e9) so 32-bit integer might be borderline? But 2^31 is about 2e9, so 20e9 is too big for 32-bit. So we should use 64-bit for tmp and cnt8. Therefore:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: cnt8, tmp\n\n        cnt8 = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        do i=1, k\n            if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n   Now, the rest as above. We must be cautious about the string s0: it might be read with trailing spaces? We read with:\n\n        read(*, '(a)') s0\n\n    This reads the entire line? And s0 is 200000 characters?",

Step 2: \n            i=1: \"AB\" -> not \"BC\", so add 'A'\n            i=2: \"BC\" -> found, so add 'D', then i=4\n            i=4: then we are at the last character? if (i<len0) -> false, so we add s0(4:4)='B'\n            So s0_transformed = \"ADB\", k=3.

Example 3: \n        Input: \"AABC\" -> becomes \"AAD\" -> then count: A: tmp=1\n            A: tmp=2\n            D: cnt8=2 -> then s1=\"2\"\n            Frequency: '2' -> distinct=1 -> \"No\"\n\n   Example 4:",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_AGC034_B) processes a string by replacing \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the number of times we can form \"AD\" (which originally was \"ABC\") by counting consecutive 'A's and then adding the count when a 'D' is encountered. The second program (atcoder_ABC132_A) checks if a string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nThe plan:\n1. We will write a Fortran program that reads the input string only once (at the beginning).\n2. We will apply the transformation and computation of the first Java program (replace \"BC\" with \"D\", then count as described) and store the result as an intermediate value. However, note that the second program does not take the output of the first as its input. Instead, the original input to the chain is the same for both? Actually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But looking at the two programs:\n\n   - The first program reads a string and outputs a long integer (the count).\n   - The second program reads a string and then checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\n   So the output of the first program (a number) is the input to the second? But the second program expects a string. This is a problem.\n\n   Let me reexamine the problem statement: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The first program outputs a long integer (for example, 3). Then the second program would read the string \"3\" and check if it has two distinct characters each appearing twice? That doesn't match the sample behavior.\n\n   Alternatively, the two programs might be independent and the problem is misstated? Or the chain is: the same input string is passed to the first program, then the output of the first is a number, which is then passed to the second? But the second expects a string.\n\n   However, note the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n   Since the two programs are independent and take different inputs? This is confusing.\n\n   But the example programs:\n\n   First program: \n        Input: a string (e.g., \"ABCBC\")\n        Output: a number (e.g., 2)\n\n   Second program:\n        Input: a string (e.g., \"AABB\")\n        Output: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n   How can the output of the first (a number) be the input to the second? The second expects a string. We can convert the number to a string? But that doesn't make sense because the second program is checking for two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that the same initial input is used for both? But then it's not a chain.\n\n   After re-reading the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (a number) must be converted to a string to become the input of the second program.\n\n   Example:\n        Input to the chain: \"ABCBC\" (for the first program)\n        Output of first: 2 (which is the integer 2)\n        Then the second program would get the string \"2\" (if we convert 2 to string) and then check: \n            The string \"2\" has only one character -> map: {'2':1} -> fails.\n\n   This does not look like the intended behavior.\n\n   However, looking at the actual programs, they are from two different problems. The first is AGC034_B and the second is ABC132_A. They are not designed to be chained. \n\n   Therefore, I suspect there might be a misunderstanding. The problem states: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So we must chain them as they are.\n\n   We have to do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial string S (for the first program).\n        Step 2: Run the first program on S: replace \"BC\" by \"D\", then count as described -> result is a long integer, say N.\n        Step 3: Convert N to a string, and that becomes the input to the second program.\n        Step 4: The second program checks if the string representation of N has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice? But note: the second program was originally designed for a 4-character string? Actually, the problem ABC132_A says: \"Given a string S of length 4 consisting of uppercase English letters\". But we are giving it a string that is the string representation of a number, which might be of any length? \n\n   This seems inconsistent.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that we are to run the two programs independently on the same input? But the problem says \"in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   Let me look again at the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n   We have two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The two programs are meant to be run on the same initial input? Then the chain would be:\n\n        Program 1: input = S, output = N (integer)\n        Program 2: input = S (the same initial string) -> but then the output of program1 is not used.\n\n   Possibility 2: The output of program1 (an integer) is the input to program2? Then we must convert the integer to a string and then run program2 on that string.\n\n   The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must do:\n\n        Step 1: Read a string S0.\n        Step 2: Process S0 with program1: output is an integer N.\n        Step 3: Convert N to a string S1.\n        Step 4: Process S1 with program2: which will output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n   Then the final output of the entire program is the \"Yes\" or \"No\" from program2.\n\n   But note: the second program (atcoder_ABC132_A) was originally designed for a string of length 4 and uppercase letters. However, the problem does not specify that the input to the second program must be of length 4? Actually, the problem says: \"Given a string S of length 4\", but in our chain the input to the second program is the string representation of an integer which could be of any length and composed of digits. So the second program would not behave as originally intended? \n\n   However, we are to chain the two programs exactly as they are. So we have to run the second program on the string representation of the integer output by the first.\n\n   Therefore, we design:\n\n        Read the initial string S0 (from standard input).\n        Process S0 to get N (by replacing \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counting as in the first program).\n        Convert N to a string S1.\n        Then, for S1, we do:\n            Count frequency of each character in S1.\n            Check if there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n        But note: the second program does:\n            if (ok && map.size() == 2) -> then print \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        However, the second program does not require the string to be of length 4? It just checks that each of the two distinct characters appears twice. That implies the string must be of length 4? Because 2 distinct characters each appearing twice: 2*2=4.\n\n        But if N is 100, then the string is \"100\", which has 3 characters: '1','0','0'. Then the frequency: '1':1, '0':2 -> map.size()=2? But one character appears once and the other twice -> fails.\n\n        So if N is 1122, then the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters '1' and '2', each appearing twice -> then output \"Yes\".\n\n   This is the behavior we must replicate.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input string (call it s0) from stdin.\n\n        Step 2: Process s0 for the first program:\n            Replace every occurrence of \"BC\" in s0 with 'D'. We traverse the string and whenever we see 'B' followed by 'C', we replace by 'D'. But note: the Java program uses `replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\")` which replaces non-overlapping occurrences. We can do the same.\n\n            Then, traverse the new string (call it s0_transformed) and:\n                let tmp = 0, cnt = 0\n                for each character c in s0_transformed:\n                    if c == 'A' then tmp = tmp + 1\n                    else if c == 'D' then cnt = cnt + tmp\n                    else (meaning if we get 'B' or 'C' or anything else) then tmp = 0\n\n            This gives an integer cnt (which we'll call n).\n\n        Step 3: Convert the integer n to a string (call it s1).\n\n        Step 4: Process s1 for the second program:\n            We need to count the frequency of each character in s1.\n            Then check:\n                - There are exactly two distinct characters.\n                - Each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n\n            Note: the original second program did not require the string to be of length 4? It only checks that each character that is present appears twice? But if the string has two distinct characters and each appears twice, then the length must be 4? Because 2*2=4.\n\n            However, what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then we have one distinct character with frequency 3 -> fails.\n\n            So the condition is: \n                if the number of distinct characters is 2 and for each distinct character the frequency is 2 -> then output \"Yes\"\n                else output \"No\"\n\n        Step 5: Output the result (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n   However, note: the second program in Java does:\n\n        for (Entry<Character, Integer> c : map.entrySet()) {\n            if (c.getValue() != 2) {\n                ok = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (ok && map.size() == 2) ...\n\n   So we must check that the map has exactly 2 entries and every entry has value 2.\n\n   Implementation in Fortran:\n\n        We'll read the initial string.\n\n        Step 2: \n            We traverse the initial string to replace \"BC\" by 'D'. But note: we must avoid overlapping. For example, if we have \"BCC\", we replace the first \"BC\" to get \"DC\", then we don't have any more \"BC\". Similarly, \"BBC\" would become \"BD\" (if we replace the \"B\" (first) and the next 'C'? Actually, the first two are \"BB\" -> not \"BC\". Then the second and third are \"BC\", so we replace that. So we have to do a while loop? But the Java replaceAll is non-overlapping and from left to right.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                i = 1\n                do while (i <= len_trim(s0)-1)\n                    if (s0(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                        s0_transformed = s0_transformed // 'D'\n                        i = i + 2   ! skip the next character\n                    else\n                        s0_transformed = s0_transformed // s0(i:i)\n                        i = i + 1\n                    endif\n                end do\n\n            But we must also handle the last character if the length is odd and the last one wasn't replaced.\n\n            Alternatively, we can traverse and build a new string:\n\n                s0_transformed = ''\n                i = 1\n                do while (i <= len(s0))\n                    if (i < len(s0) .and. s0(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                        s0_transformed = s0_transformed // 'D'\n                        i = i + 2\n                    else\n                        s0_transformed = s0_transformed // s0(i:i)\n                        i = i + 1\n                    endif\n                end do\n\n            But note: the Java replaceAll replaces all non-overlapping occurrences. This method does that.\n\n        Then we traverse s0_transformed to compute n.\n\n        Step 3: Convert n to a string. We can use internal write.\n\n        Step 4: \n            We have a string s1 (which is the string representation of n). We need to count frequency.\n\n            We can use an array or a map? But Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps for characters. We can use an array for all possible characters? But the characters in the string are digits and possibly a minus sign? Note: the first program outputs a nonnegative integer? Because the problem in the first program is counting occurrences. So n>=0. Then the string will consist of digits only? So the characters are '0' to '9'.\n\n            But the second program was designed for uppercase letters? Now we have digits? It doesn't matter. We just count.\n\n            However, the string might be long? The maximum length of the integer string: n can be up to 10^5? Actually, the first program: the string s0 can be up to 200000 characters? But the count n is at most (number of A's) * (number of BC's) -> which could be large? We might get an integer that is 10^10, so 11 digits. So the string s1 will be at most 11 characters.\n\n            We can use an array of size 0:255? Or we can use a fixed array for digits? But the second program is generic for any characters. Since the string is short (<=20 digits maybe), we can do:\n\n                integer :: freq(0:255) = 0   ! but we don't know the character set? Actually, we know the string is digits, so we can do:\n\n                We can use an array for '0' to '9'. But note: the string might have a minus? The problem says n>=0, so no minus.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Let s1 = the string of n.\n\n                Initialize an array `freq` for characters from '0' to '9' (we can index by the ASCII, or we can use a mapping).\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    integer :: counts(0:9) = 0   ! for digits '0' to '9'\n\n                But the second program counts any character. Since our string has only digits, we can do:\n\n                    do i=1, len_trim(s1)\n                        c = s1(i:i)\n                        ! convert c to an integer index? Or we can use a larger array.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use a simple array for all ASCII characters? But we don't need that because the string is digits.\n\n                Actually, the second program in Java uses a HashMap for any character. We don't know if the integer might be negative? But the problem states the first program outputs a nonnegative integer. So we are safe for digits.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    integer :: freq(48:57) = 0   ! '0' is 48, '9' is 57\n\n                Or we can do:\n\n                    character(len=20) :: s1\n                    integer :: i, ascii, distinct, total\n                    integer :: freq(0:255) = 0   ! covering ASCII 0 to 255\n\n                Then:\n\n                    do i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n                        ascii = ichar(s1(i:i))\n                        freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n                    end do\n\n                Then we traverse the array of freq? But we only care about the characters that appear? We can:\n\n                    distinct = 0\n                    allTwos = .true.\n                    do i = 0, 255\n                        if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                            distinct = distinct + 1\n                            if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                                allTwos = .false.\n                            end if\n                        end if\n                    end do\n\n                Then if (distinct == 2 .and. allTwos) then\n                    print *, \"Yes\"\n                else\n                    print *, \"No\"\n                end if\n\n            But note: the second program in Java breaks as soon as it finds one character that is not 2. We can break early? But the array is small (256) so it's not a big deal.\n\n            However, the condition in the Java program: \n                It breaks when it finds one character that is not 2 -> sets ok to false and breaks.\n\n                Then it checks: if (ok and map.size()==2) -> then \"Yes\"\n\n            So we must check that there are exactly two distinct characters and every distinct character has frequency 2.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                distinct = 0\n                flag = .true.   ! assume all are two until proven otherwise\n                do i = 0, 255\n                    if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                        distinct = distinct + 1\n                        if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                            flag = .false.\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                if (distinct == 2 .and. flag) then\n                    write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n                else\n                    write(*,*) \"No\"\n                end if\n\n            But note: if there are more than two distinct characters, we don't break early? We are already traversing the entire frequency array. Since the array is small, it's acceptable.\n\n        Step 5: Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n   However, note: the original second program prints \"Yes\" or \"No\" without quotes? Actually, it prints without quotes? But in Java, System.out.println(\"Yes\") prints Yes without quotes. In Fortran, we write without quotes? Actually, we are writing a string without quotes: \n\n        write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n\n    This will output: Yes\n\n    But note: the asterisk format may add extra spaces? We can use:\n\n        write(*,'(a)') \"Yes\"\n\n    to avoid extra spaces.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        program chain\n        implicit none\n        character(len=200000) :: s0   ! the problem says the first string up to 200000 characters?\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s0_transformed\n        integer :: i, j, n, tmp, cnt\n        integer*8 :: cnt8   ! the count might be large, so we use integer*8? In the Java program, it's long.\n        character(len=20) :: s1   ! to hold the string representation of cnt8\n        integer :: freq(0:255)\n        integer :: ascii, distinct\n        logical :: flag\n\n        !

We'll assume the length of s0 is known by len_trim(s0)\n        s0_transformed = ''\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= len_trim(s0))\n            if (i < len_trim(s0) .and. s0(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                s0_transformed = s0_transformed // 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                s0_transformed = s0_transformed // s0(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        ! Now traverse s0_transformed to compute the count\n        cnt8 = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        do i = 1, len(s0_transformed)\n            if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 3: convert cnt8 to string\n        write(s1, *) cnt8\n        ! But this write will put the number with leading spaces? We can adjust to remove leading spaces?\n        ! We don't care because the frequency count doesn't care about spaces? Actually, the string representation should be without spaces? \n        ! The write statement with * format for an integer will right-justify? We can use trim to remove leading and trailing spaces? Actually, we have trailing spaces? The variable s1 is 20 characters. We can use:\n\n        s1 = adjustl(s1)   ! left adjust to remove leading spaces? But we don't want to include spaces in the frequency? Actually, the write might put the number without any extra spaces? Actually, no: the integer is written right-justified in a field of 20? So we have leading spaces.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            write(s1, '(I0)') cnt8   ! this writes without leading spaces.\n\n        But note: the I0 format writes the integer with the minimum width. This is available in Fortran 95 and later.\n\n        Step 4: build frequency array for s1 (without trailing spaces? We can use the trimmed string: s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))? But the second program should consider the entire string including leading zeros? But we don't have leading zeros. And the number is nonnegative. So we can use:\n\n            s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        But wait: the frequency count should be done on the entire string including any leading zeros? Actually, the write with I0 doesn't produce leading zeros. And adjustl removes leading spaces. So we can use:\n\n            s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        But note: the string might have trailing spaces? We allocated s1 as 20 characters. We need to consider only the non-space part? So we'll use:\n\n            s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        Then we traverse the non-space part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without spaces and then we know the length by the integer? But we can just use the trimmed string.\n\n        Let s1_trimmed = adjustl(s1)   ! this left adjusts, then we can use the trimmed part? Actually, we don't need to trim the trailing spaces? Because adjustl moves the non-space to the left and leaves trailing spaces. Then we can use the length of the non-blank part.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        Then the length is len_trim(s1_trimmed).\n\n        But we don't have to create a new variable? We can use the original s1 and then use the trimmed part? But we can just use:\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        But we can do:\n\n            s1 = adjustl(s1)   ! now the string is left aligned, but trailing spaces remain? Then we can use the trimmed part.\n\n            j = len_trim(s1)   ! because after adjustl, the trailing spaces are still there? Actually, adjustl only shifts left and pads with spaces on the right. Then trim removes trailing spaces? Actually, no: adjustl does not remove trailing spaces, it shifts the non-space part to the left and pads the end with spaces. Then trim(s1) will remove the trailing spaces? Actually, trim removes trailing spaces? No, trim removes trailing blanks. So:\n\n            s1_trimmed = trim(adjustl(s1))\n\n        is the string without leading or trailing spaces? Actually, adjustl removes leading spaces and moves the string to the left, and then trim removes the trailing spaces? But the string is now the number without any extra spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid creating a new variable by using:\n\n            s1 = adjustl(s1)   ! now the non-space part is at the beginning, but the total length is still 20? Then we can find the length by scanning for the first space? Or we can use:\n\n            nlen = len_trim(s1)   ! after adjustl, the leading spaces are gone, but trailing spaces are still there? Actually, adjustl does not change the length of the string. So if we have a 20-character string, after adjustl, the non-space part is at the beginning and the rest are spaces. Then len_trim(s1) will give the length without trailing spaces? Actually, len_trim returns the length without trailing spaces.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            s1 = adjustl(s1)   ! left adjust the number string in s1\n            nlen = len_trim(s1)   ! the actual length of the number\n\n        Then we consider s1(1:nlen)\n\n        Now, we initialize freq array to 0.\n\n        freq = 0   ! set entire array to 0\n\n        do i = 1, nlen\n            ascii = ichar(s1(i:i))\n            freq(ascii) = freq(ascii) + 1\n        end do\n\n        distinct = 0\n        flag = .true.\n        do ascii = 0, 255\n            if (freq(ascii) > 0) then\n                distinct = distinct + 1\n                if (freq(ascii) /= 2) then\n                    flag = .false.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (distinct == 2 .and. flag) then\n            write(*, '(a)') 'Yes'\n        else\n            write(*, '(a)') 'No'\n        end if\n\n   However, note: the second program in Java does not break early in the frequency check? Actually, it breaks as soon as it finds one character that is not 2. We are not breaking early, but the array is small (256) so it's acceptable.\n\n   But we can break early? We can do:\n\n        distinct = 0\n        flag = .true.\n        do ascii = 0, 255\n            if (freq(ascii) > 0) then\n                distinct = distinct + 1\n                if (freq(ascii) /= 2) then\n                    flag = .false.\n                    ! We don't break because we still need to count distinct? Actually, we can break only if we are not counting distinct? But we need to know the total distinct. So we cannot break in the middle of the frequency array? We have to check every index.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the loop if we already found one character that is not 2? But that doesn't change the fact that we have to count distinct? Actually, if we break the frequency array scan, we don't know the distinct count. So we must traverse the entire array.\n\n   Therefore, we leave as above.\n\n   But note: the distinct count must be 2, and every character must be 2. We can do:\n\n        if (distinct /= 2) then\n            flag = .false.\n        end if\n\n   But we are already setting flag to false if any character is not 2. And then we check distinct==2 and flag.\n\n   So the condition is: distinct must be 2 and flag must be true (meaning no character had frequency other than 2).\n\n   However, what if there are three distinct characters? Then distinct=3, and we set flag to false? Then we output \"No\". Correct.\n\n   But what if there are two distinct characters, but one of them has frequency 2 and the other has frequency 3? Then distinct=2, but flag becomes false -> output \"No\". Correct.\n\n   What if two distinct characters, both frequency 2? Then distinct=2 and flag remains true -> output \"Yes\".\n\n   So the logic is correct.\n\n   Edge: if the string is empty? Then distinct=0 -> flag is true? But we traverse the frequency array: no positive frequency -> distinct=0, and flag remains true? Then condition: distinct==2? no -> output \"No\". Correct.\n\n   But note: the first program: if the input is empty, then cnt8=0, then s1=\"0\". Then distinct=1 (only '0') and frequency of '0' is 1 -> distinct=1, flag becomes false -> output \"No\". Correct.\n\n   We must use integer*8 for cnt8? Because the count might be large (up to 10^10). In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8). \n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the original Java program uses long (64-bit integer). We'll use integer(kind=8) for cnt8.\n\n   Also, the string s0: the problem says the length can be up to 200000. So we allocate s0 to 200000 characters.\n\n   But when we build s0_transformed, the length is at most the same? Because we replace two characters by one, so the length is at most the original length? Actually, it might be less? But we can allocate s0_transformed to the same length? But we are using an allocatable string? We can use:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s0_transformed\n\n        s0_transformed = ''   ! initialize\n        allocate(character(len=0) :: s0_transformed)   ! not necessary? We can build by concatenation? But that might be inefficient for 200000. \n\n        Alternatively, we can pre-allocate s0_transformed to the same length as s0? Because the transformed string is at most the same length? Actually, it can be shorter? But we can allocate to the same length and then adjust? Or we can build by concatenation and then trim? But in Fortran, concatenation of large strings can be O(n^2). \n\n   We can avoid by pre-allocating:\n\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n        allocate(character(len=len0) :: s0_transformed)   ! but we don't know the exact length? Actually, the transformed string will be shorter? We can count the number of replacements? Or we can use a dynamic string? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a buffer that we fill and then adjust the length? \n\n   Since the maximum length of s0_transformed is len0, we can create an array of characters and then build the string.\n\n        character(len=1), allocatable :: temp(:)\n        integer :: len0, k\n\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n        allocate(temp(len0))   ! maximum length: len0\n        k = 0\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= len0)\n            if (i < len0 .and. s0(i:i+1)==\"BC\") then\n                k = k + 1\n                temp(k) = 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                k = k + 1\n                temp(k) = s0(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, we have k characters in temp(1:k)\n        s0_transformed = ''\n        do i=1, k\n            s0_transformed = s0_transformed // temp(i)\n        end do\n\n        But again, the concatenation in a loop is O(k^2). We can avoid by:\n\n            allocate(character(len=k) :: s0_transformed)\n            do i=1, k\n                s0_transformed(i:i) = temp(i)\n            end do\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the temporary array by building the transformed string in a pre-allocated string of the same length and then taking a substring? But the length is variable.\n\n   However, the maximum k is len0, which is 200000, so building by concatenation in a loop (k steps, each concatenation of a string of length L and a character: O(L)) would be O(k^2) which is 40e9 operations? That is too slow.\n\n   Therefore, we use the temporary array of characters and then build the string in one go.\n\n   Steps for Step 2 (replace):\n\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n        allocate(character(len=len0) :: s0_transformed)   ! we will adjust the length later? Actually, we don't know the final length. We can use:\n\n        ! Instead, we'll use an array of characters and then build the string of exact length.\n\n        character(len=1) :: temp(len0)   ! fixed size array of length len0\n        integer :: k, len0\n\n        k = 0\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= len0)\n            if (i < len0 .and. s0(i:i+1)==\"BC\") then\n                k = k + 1\n                temp(k) = 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                k = k + 1\n                temp(k) = s0(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, allocate s0_transformed with length k\n        allocate(character(len=k) :: s0_transformed)\n        do i=1, k\n            s0_transformed(i:i) = temp(i)\n        end do\n\n   But note: the array temp is of fixed size (len0) and k<=len0, so it's safe.\n\n   Now, we have s0_transformed of length k.\n\n   Then we do the counting.\n\n   However, note: the first program does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n            if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (s.charAt(i) == 'D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        cnt8 = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        do i=1, k\n            if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n   Note: tmp and cnt8 are integers. But the count can be large, so we use integer(kind=8) for cnt8? And tmp might be up to the number of consecutive A's, which is <=200000? So integer is enough for tmp? But we use integer for tmp? However, in the accumulation: cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp, and tmp can be 200000 and we do that for every D? The maximum D is 100000? Then the maximum cnt8 is 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer? But 20e9 is 2e10, which is about 20 billion -> 2e10, which is less than 2^35 (about 34e9) so 32-bit integer might be borderline? But 2^31 is about 2e9, so 20e9 is too big for 32-bit. So we should use 64-bit for tmp and cnt8.\n\n   Therefore:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: cnt8, tmp\n\n        cnt8 = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        do i=1, k\n            if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (s0_transformed(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt8 = cnt8 + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n   Now, the rest as above.\n\n   We must be cautious about the string s0: it might be read with trailing spaces? We read with:\n\n        read(*, '(a)') s0\n\n    This reads the entire line? And s0 is 200000 characters? The input string might be shorter? Then s0 will have trailing spaces? But we use len_trim(s0) to get the actual length.\n\n    Alternatively, we can read and then find the actual length? The read with '(a)' will put the entire line, and then we can use len_trim to remove trailing spaces? But the input string might contain spaces? The problem says: the first program reads a string? The problem says: the string s can be up to 200000 characters and consists of A, B, and C. So no space? Then we can safely use len_trim to get the length without trailing spaces? Actually, the read will read the entire line? The problem says one string? So we assume one token? \n\n    We can do:\n\n        read(*, *) s0   ! this will read one token? But the problem says the string may be long? And it might have no spaces? So we can use:\n\n        read(*, '(a)') s0\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n\n    But note: if the input string has trailing spaces, then we would keep them? But the problem says the string consists of A, B, C. So no space. So we can use len_trim to get the length? Or we can read and then find the first newline? The read with '(a)' will read until the end of the line? So we get the entire line? And the string should be without newline? Then the trailing spaces are part of the string? But the problem says the string consists of A, B, C. So if there is a space, it would be invalid? But we are safe to use len_trim? Actually, we want the entire string including any trailing spaces? But the problem says the string is of A, B, C. So we assume no space? Then we can use:\n\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n\n    to get the length without trailing spaces? But what if the string has no trailing spaces? Then len_trim returns the entire length.\n\n    Alternatively, we can read and then find the length by scanning for the first non-space? Actually, we don't know. Since the problem says the string is of A, B, C, and the first program uses in.next() which in Java reads a token (by default delimited by whitespace). So we should read a token? In Fortran, we can read the next token by:\n\n        read(*, *) s0   ! this reads one token? But the token may be up to 200000 characters? And the variable s0 is 200000 characters? Then if the token is 200000, it fits. If the token is longer, it will be truncated? \n\n    We must avoid truncation. So we read with:\n\n        character(len=200000) :: s0\n        read(*, '(a)') s0   ! reads the entire line? But the problem says the input is one string? So the entire line is the string? And the string has no newline? Then we can use:\n\n        s0 = adjustl(s0)   ! remove leading spaces? But the token might have leading spaces? The Java program uses next(), which skips leading whitespace and then takes the next token. So we should do the same? \n\n        We can read the entire line and then take the first token? Or we can use:\n\n            read(*, *) s0   ! list-directed read: reads one token\n\n        But the token might be up to 200000? And the variable s0 is 200000? Then if the token is 200000, it fits. If it is longer, it will be truncated? So we must ensure the variable is long enough.\n\n        Since the problem says the string is up to 200000, we set s0 to 200000.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            read(*, *) s0   ! list-directed read: skips leading spaces, reads until next space? But the problem says the string has no spaces? So the entire line is the token? But the problem says one string. So we can read the entire line? But the entire line is the string? \n\n        Actually, the Java program uses in.next(), so we should read a token. But the problem says the input is a string of A, B, C. So it has no space? Then the entire line is the token? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            read(*, '(a)') s0   ! read the entire line\n            len0 = len_trim(s0)   ! then remove trailing spaces? But the string might have trailing spaces? The token is the entire line? \n\n        But the problem says the input is one string. So we can use:\n\n            read(*, *) s0   ! this will read the next token (without spaces) and put it in s0, and if s0 is longer than the token, the rest is filled with spaces? Then we can use len_trim(s0) to get the token length? Actually, no: the token is stored without trailing spaces? Actually, no: the token is stored in s0 and then the rest of s0 is space? Then len_trim(s0) returns the length of the token? Because the token has no trailing space? But the token is stored in the left part? So we can do:\n\n            s0 = trim(s0)   ! not necessary? The token is stored without trailing spaces? Actually, no: the read with list-directed will put the token and then the rest of the 200000 characters are undefined? Actually, the standard says: if the input item is shorter than the variable, the rest of the variable is filled with blanks? So we can use:\n\n            len0 = len_trim(s0)   ! this will give the length of the token? Actually, no: because the token might have trailing spaces? But the token is read as the next sequence of non-space? So the token has no leading or trailing spaces? Then the entire s0 has the token left-justified and the rest are spaces? Then len_trim(s0) will give the length of the token? Correct.\n\n        But note: the token might be 200000? Then s0 is exactly 200000, and there are no trailing spaces? Then len_trim(s0) returns 200000? Because the token is 200000 and there are no trailing spaces? Actually, no: the token is 200000 and the variable is 200000, so there are no trailing spaces? Then len_trim(s0) returns 200000? But that's the same as len(s0). So we can use:\n\n            len0 = len_trim(s0)\n\n        But if the token is 200000, then the entire variable is non-blank? Then len_trim returns 200000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            len0 = index(s0, ' ') - 1\n            if (len0 < 0) len0 = len(s0)\n\n        But that's more complicated. We'll use:\n\n            len0 = len_trim(s0)\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        program chain\n        implicit none\n        character(len=200000) :: s0\n        character(len=1), allocatable :: temp(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s0_transformed\n        integer :: i, j, k, len0, nlen, ascii, distinct\n        integer(kind=8) :: cnt8, tmp\n        character(len=20) :: s1\n        integer :: freq(0:255)\n        logical :: flag\n\n        !

(because 1 !=2) -> output \"No\".\n\n   But the original first program outputs 1? Then the second program gets the string \"1\" and outputs \"No\". Correct.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"ABCB\"\n        Step 1: s0 = \"ABCB\", len0=4.\n        Step 2: \n            i=1: \"AB\" -> not \"BC\", so add 'A'\n            i=2: \"BC\" -> found, so add 'D', then i=4\n            i=4: then we are at the last character? \n                if (i<len0) -> false, so we add s0(4:4)='B'\n            So s0_transformed = \"ADB\", k=3.\n        Counting:\n            i1: 'A' -> tmp=1\n            i2: 'D' -> cnt8=1\n            i3: 'B' -> reset tmp to 0 -> so cnt8=1.\n        Then s1=\"1\" -> output \"No\".\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: \"AABC\" -> becomes \"AAD\" -> then count: \n            A: tmp=1\n            A: tmp=2\n            D: cnt8=2 -> then s1=\"2\"\n            Frequency: '2' -> distinct=1 -> \"No\"\n\n   Example 4: \n        We need a string that after the first program produces a number that is a string of two distinct characters each twice.\n\n        How about: \n            Input: \"ABCBC\" -> becomes \"AD\" (from first \"BC\") and then the next \"BC\" becomes 'D'? \n            Actually: \n                \"ABCBC\": \n                    i=1: 'A' -> add 'A'\n                    i=2: \"BC\" -> replace with 'D', then i becomes 4.\n                    i=4: then we have the next character is 'B', and then the next (i=4 and i<5) -> \"BC\" again? \n                    But the string is \"A\", then \"BC\", then \"BC\"? \n                    So we replace the first BC at i=2 to get D, then we are at i=4, and then we see \"BC\" again? \n                So we get \"ADD\"? \n\n            Then counting:\n                A: tmp=1\n                D: cnt8=1, tmp remains 1\n                D: cnt8=1+1=2\n            Then s1=\"2\", which is one character -> distinct=1 -> \"No\".\n\n        How about a string that produces a number 1122? \n            We need a string that the first program outputs 1122.\n\n            How the first program works:\n                It counts consecutive A's until it hits a non-A and non-D, then resets.\n                When it hits a D, it adds the current tmp (which is the number of consecutive A's to the left) to the count.\n\n            Example: \n                We want to get a large count? \n\n            Let me take: s0 = \"A\" repeated 100 times and then \"BC\" repeated 100 times? \n                Then transformed: \"A...A\" (100 times) and then \"D\" repeated 100 times.\n\n                Then when we traverse:\n                    We have 100 A's: tmp=100\n                    Then each D: adds 100 -> 100*100 = 10000.\n\n                Then the number is 10000 -> string \"10000\": distinct characters: '1' and '0'. \n                    '1':1 time, '0':4 times -> distinct=2? But '0' appears 4 times -> not 2 -> output \"No\".\n\n            We want a number that is 1122? \n                How to get 1122? \n                Example: \n                    We can have 1122 = 1122.\n\n                How about: \n                    We have 1122 A's? That's not possible.\n\n                We can break the A's: \n                    We need to have 1122 = a1 * d1 + a2 * d2 + ... \n\n                It might be easier to design the transformed string: \n                    We want the count to be 1122.\n\n                How about: \n                    We have 1122 times: a sequence of one 'A' and then a 'D'? \n                    Then the count would be 1 repeated 1122 times -> 1122.\n\n                Then the transformed string: \"ADADAD...AD\" (1122 times) -> then the count is 1 for each D -> total 1122.\n\n                Then the original string: replace D by BC -> \"ABCABCABC...ABC\" (1122 times).\n\n                Then the string length is 1122 * 3 = 3366.\n\n                Then the number 1122 -> string \"1122\": \n                    distinct: two characters: '1' and '2'\n                    frequency: '1': 2 times, '2': 2 times -> output \"Yes\".\n\n            So input: \"ABC\" repeated 1122 times.\n\n            Step 1: read \"ABCABC...ABC\" (3366 characters)\n\n            Step 2: replace every \"BC\" by 'D' -> becomes \"AD\" repeated 1122 times.\n\n            Step 2: counting: \n                Start: \n                    A: tmp=1\n                    D: add 1 -> cnt8=1, then reset? No, we don't reset at D. Then next A: tmp becomes 2? \n                    Actually, the next character after D is A? Then the transformed string: \"ADAD...\" -> \n                    i1: 'A' -> tmp=1\n                    i2: 'D' -> cnt8=1, and then we leave tmp=1? (because the D doesn't reset) -> but the next character is A? \n                    i3: 'A' -> tmp=2\n                    i4: 'D' -> cnt8=1+2=3\n                    i5: 'A' -> tmp=3\n                    i6: 'D' -> cnt8=3+3=6\n\n                So it's the triangular number? \n\n                The count after k AD pairs: \n                    First pair: 1\n                    Second pair: 1+2\n                    Third pair: 1+2+3\n                    ... \n                    After n pairs: T_n = n*(n+1)/2\n\n                We want T_n = 1122 -> n*(n+1)/2 = 1122 -> n^2 ~ 2244 -> n ~ 47 -> 47*48/2 = 1128.\n\n                So we need 47 pairs? Then count=1128.\n\n                Then the string for the second program is \"1128\": \n                    distinct: '1','2','8' -> distinct=3 -> output \"No\".\n\n            How to get 1122? \n\n                We can have non consecutive: \n                    We can have a block of 1122 A's and then one D? Then the count would be 1122.\n\n                Then the transformed string: \"A...A\" (1122 times) and then 'D'. \n                Then the count: 1122.\n\n                The original string: the D is from \"BC\", so the original string: \"A...ABC\" (1122 A's and then BC).\n\n                Then the number 1122 -> string \"1122\": \n                    distinct: '1' and '2'\n                    frequency: '1':2 times, '2':2 times -> output \"Yes\".\n\n            So input: 1122 A's followed by \"BC\".\n\n            Step 1: s0 = (1122 times 'A') // \"BC\"\n\n            Step 2: replace \"BC\" by 'D' -> becomes 1122 times 'A' and then 'D'\n\n            Step 2: counting: \n                Traverse 1122 A's: tmp=1122\n                Then the D: cnt8 = 1122\n\n            Then s1 = \"1122\"\n\n            Step 4: \n                distinct: \n                    '1': appears twice\n                    '2': appears twice\n                distinct=2, and both frequencies are 2 -> output \"Yes\".\n\n        So the program should output \"Yes\" for this input.\n\n   Therefore, the code above should work.\n\n   We write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: we use integer(kind=8) for cnt8 and tmp.\n\n   Let me write the complete code.\n\n   Note: We must free the allocatables? The program ends, so it's not necessary.\n\n   Code:\n\n        program chain\n        implicit none\n        character(len=200000) :: s0\n        character(len=1), allocatable :: temp(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s0_transformed\n        integer :: i, k, len0, nlen, ascii, distinct\n        integer(kind=8) :: cnt8, tmp_count\n        character(len=20) :: s1\n        integer :: freq(0:255)\n        logical :: flag\n\n        ! Step 1: read the input string (as a token)\n        read(*, *) s0\n        len0 = len_trim(s0)\n\n        ! If the string is empty, we still need to process? \n        if (len0 == 0) then\n            ! Then the transformed string is empty, cnt8=0, then s1=\"0\", then distinct=1 -> output \"No\"\n            ! So we can proceed as below, but we avoid the loop.\n            allocate(character(len=0) :: s0_transformed)\n            cnt8 = 0\n        else\n            ! Allocate temp array for building transformed string\n            allocate(temp(len0))\n            k = 0\n            i = 1\n            do while (i <= len0)\n                if (i < len0) then\n                    if (s0(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                        k = k + 1\n                        temp(k) = 'D'\n                        i = i + 2\n                        cycle\n                    end if\n                end if\n                k = k + 1\n                temp(k) = s0(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n\n            !

But the ichar returns a value in [0,255] for ASCII? Actually, it returns the ASCII value which is in [0,127]? But we defined freq(0:255). So it's safe.\n\n   We can remove the condition and just do:\n\n        ascii_val = ichar(s1(i:i))\n        freq(ascii_val) = freq(ascii_val) + 1\n\n   But if the character is not in 0..255, then we get an out-of-bound? But the string s1 is digits, so in '0' to '9' (48 to 57). So it's safe.\n\n   We'll remove the condition.\n\n   Final code:"
