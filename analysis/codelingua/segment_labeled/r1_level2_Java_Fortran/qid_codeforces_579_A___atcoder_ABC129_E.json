Actually, we have been moding at every step, so dp0 and dp1 are in the range [0, M-1]. Then 3*dp1 might be up to 3*(M-1) -> which is less than 2^31? M=1000000007, so 3*(M-1) = 3000000021, which is less than 2^31 (which is about 2e9) -> actually 2^31 is 2147483648, and 3000000021 > 2147483648. So we must use mod arithmetic to avoid overflow. We can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(int(0, kind=8) + dp0 + 3*dp1, M)   ? But we can break the mod:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0, M)   ! but dp0 is already moded? then add mod(3*dp1, M) and mod again. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3*dp1, M) But if dp0 and dp1 are moded (so less than M), then dp0 + 3*dp1 <= M-1 + 3*(M-1) = 4*M-4 -> which is about 4e9, which is too big for 32-bit integer? Therefore, we must use 64-bit integers for intermediate? Since Fortran integers might be 32-bit, we can use a 64-bit integer for the multiplication? Or we can use modulo arithmetic that avoids overflow. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod( int(dp0, 8) + 3_int64 * int(dp1, 8), M) But we can also do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod( dp0, M )   ! dp0 mod M is dp0\n      temp_val = 3 * dp1\n      temp_val = mod(temp_val, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod(new_dp1 + temp_val, M)\n\n  But that is for the '1' case? Actually, the expression for the '1' case is:\n\n      new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)\n\n  We can compute:\n\n      new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod( dp0, M )\n      new_dp1 = mod( new_dp1 + mod(3 * dp1, M), M)\n\n  But note: 3*dp1 might be huge? We do mod(3 * dp1, M) first. Similarly, for the '0' case: \n      new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n          new_dp0 = dp0   ! but we are going to mod it?

But for the '0' case, new_dp0 is set to dp0, which might be large? Actually, we are doing mod at every step? So we must mod new_dp0 and new_dp1?

Then the second program reads \"0\", and outputs 1. So the chain: input 0 -> first program outputs 0 -> second program reads \"0\" and outputs 1. Our combined program for n=0 outputs 1. Therefore, it matches. However, the first program in Java for n=0 outputs 0? Then the second program would read \"0\" and output 1. So the overall output is 1. But our first step: popcount(0)=0 -> then we run the DP on the binary representation of 0 (which is \"0\") -> which outputs 1. So it's the same. But wait, the first Java program for n=0:\n\n        while (n>0) ... -> doesn't run -> s is empty -> then the for loop: s.length()=0 -> ans=0 -> prints 0. Then the second program reads \"0\" (from the output of the first) and does the DP and outputs 1. Our combined program does the same: reads 0, then outputs 1. Therefore, it is consistent. We must test with n=1:\n\n      n=1: \n          popcount: 1 -> k=1 -> bin_str=\"1\"\n          DP: j=1: character '1'\n                  new_dp0 = 2 * 1 = 2\n                  new_dp1 = 1 + 3*0 = 1\n              then dp0=2 mod M =2, dp1=1 mod M=1\n              total = 3. The expected: \n          First program: n=1 -> binary \"1\" -> count=1 -> output 1. Then the second program: reads the string \"1\", which is the decimal digit 1? But wait, the second program expects a binary string? Actually, the second program reads a string of binary digits. The output of the first program is \"1\", which is a string of one character.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_579_A):\n  Reads an integer `n`.\n  Converts `n` to its binary representation as a string (in reverse order, but that doesn't matter for counting ones).\n  Counts the number of '1's in that binary string and prints the count.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC129_E):\n  Reads a string of binary digits (from the next line of input).\n  Performs a dynamic programming calculation on the string and prints a result modulo 1000000007.\n\nHowever, note that the output of the first program is an integer (the count of ones) and the second program expects a string of binary digits (0s and 1s). But the second program actually expects the input to be a string of 0s and 1s? However, the first program outputs an integer. This would cause a type mismatch.\n\nBut let me reexamine the problem: \n  The entire sequence: The output of the first program becomes the input to the second.\n\nBut the first program outputs an integer (say k), and the second program reads a string of binary digits. This does not match.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding. The problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program is an integer (as a string without any extra spaces) and then the second program reads that integer as a string? \n\nFor example, if the input to the first program is 5, then the first program outputs \"2\" (because 5 in binary is 101 -> two ones). Then the second program would read the string \"2\". But the second program expects a string of binary digits (like \"101\" or \"1\"). It does not expect a string that represents a decimal number.\n\nThis indicates that the two programs were not designed to be chained. However, the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that the entire set of programs are to be combined so that the output of the first is passed as an integer to the next? But the second program expects a string of binary digits. How can we reconcile?\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads a string of binary digits and then processes each character. The first program produces an integer. We cannot directly chain them.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nWhat is the overall behavior?\n  Input to the entire sequence: the input to the first program (an integer).\n  Output of the entire sequence: the output of the second program (an integer modulo 1000000007).\n\nBut the second program expects a string of binary digits. How do we connect the first program's output (an integer) to the second program's input (a binary string)? \n\nActually, the second program does not use the integer value of the first program's output. Instead, the first program's output is an integer that is the count of ones in the binary representation of the input integer. Then the second program would take that count and interpret it as a string? But that string would be a decimal representation of the count.\n\nHowever, the second program is designed for a string of binary digits (each character is either '0' or '1'). If we give it the string \"2\", that is not a binary digit string. So that would break.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the first program's output (the count) is to be converted to its binary representation? But that is not what the second program does. The second program is solving a problem for a given binary string (which originally was a large number in binary). \n\nBut note: the problem states that the programs are meant to be executed in sequence. Therefore, we must interpret the entire chain.\n\nAfter reading the problem again: the entire sequence. The first program takes an integer and outputs the number of ones in its binary representation (as an integer). The second program takes a string (which is a binary representation of a number) and does a DP to compute the number of ways to split the binary string under certain conditions? \n\nHow can we chain them? The output of the first is an integer, say k. Then the second program must use k? But the second program expects a string of 0/1. \n\nWe must reinterpret: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". The input to the chain is the integer n for the first program. The output of the chain is the output of the second program. But the second program must take the output of the first as its input? That output is an integer. So we must convert that integer into a binary string? \n\nBut note: the first program outputs the count of ones. Then we take that count and use it as the input to the second program? However, the second program expects a binary string. So we should convert the count (which is an integer) to a binary string? Then the second program will process that binary string.\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Step 1: Read integer n.\n  Step 2: Convert n to binary and count the ones -> let k = popcount(n).\n  Step 3: Convert k to a binary string (without any extra characters, just the binary digits).\n  Step 4: Run the DP of the second program on the binary string of k.\n\nBut wait, the original second program reads a string from the input. So we are effectively replacing the input to the second program with the binary representation of k.\n\nTherefore, the overall program:\n  - Reads an integer n.\n  - Computes k = popcount(n) (the number of ones in the binary representation of n).\n  - Converts k to a binary string (without any extra characters, and without leading zeros? Actually, we must represent k in base2 as a string of 0s and 1s).\n  - Then runs the DP of the second program on that binary string.\n\nBut note: the second program's DP is designed for a binary string that represents a number? And it counts the number of ways to assign each digit to either of two groups? Actually, the problem from atcoder ABC129 E is \"Sum Equals Xor\", which typically is: given a binary string L, count the pairs (a, b) such that a+b <= L and a XOR b = a+b, modulo 10^9+7.\n\nHowever, we are now applying that to the binary representation of k (which is the popcount of n). \n\nSo the overall output is: the result of the second program when run on the binary string representation of k.\n\nTherefore, we must combine both steps without intermediate I/O.\n\nPlan for Fortran:\n  1. Read an integer n.\n  2. Compute the popcount of n (this is k). We can do this by counting the ones in the binary representation of n.\n  3. Convert k to a binary string. We have to form a string of the binary representation of k (without leading zeros, but note: if k is 0 then the string should be \"0\").\n  4. Then, we run the DP of the second program on that binary string.\n\nBut note: the second program uses modulo 1000000007.\n\nHowever, the second program in Java uses a 2D DP array of dimensions [n+1][2] (where n is the length of the string). We must do the same.\n\nSteps in Fortran:\n  - Read the integer n.\n  - Compute k: the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.\n  - Convert k to a binary string. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 2 until k becomes 0, and then reverse the string? But note: the Java program for the first program built the string in reverse order (least significant bit first) but then counted the ones without reversing. However, for the second program, the binary string is expected to be in the usual order (most significant bit first). So we must form the binary string of k in the usual way (without reversing the digits we get, but actually we have to reverse because we get LSB first?).\n\nAlternatively, we can form the binary string by starting from the highest power. But we can also build the string in reverse and then reverse it? However, note: the second program processes the string from left to right (the first character is the most significant). So we must have the string in the usual order.\n\nBut note: the first program didn't reverse the string and then counted the ones? Actually, it built the string by appending the least significant bit first, so the string was the binary in reverse. But then it counted the ones and that doesn't depend on the order. Then for the second program, we need the binary representation of k in the usual order.\n\nSo for k, we can build the binary string in reverse and then reverse it? Or we can build it from the most significant bit.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid reversing by building the string in the correct order? We can compute the length of the binary representation and then build from the top.\n\nBut note: k is at most about 64 (since n is an integer, which in Java is 32 bits, but Fortran integers can be 32 or 64? We'll assume the same). So we can build the binary representation by:\n\n  if k==0, then the string is \"0\"\n  else:\n      we find the highest power: then go from high to low.\n\nBut we can also use Fortran's bit functions? However, we are forming a string.\n\nApproach for converting k to binary string (big-endian, most significant first):\n\n  Let s = \"\"\n  Let temp = k\n  Find the highest power p such that 2^p <= k. Then for i from p down to 0:\n      if the i-th bit is set, then append '1'\n      else append '0'\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n  s = ''\n  temp = k\n  p = floor(log2(k))   [if k>0]\n\nBut if k is 0, then we output \"0\".\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  if (k == 0) then\n      s = \"0\"\n  else\n      allocate a character array of length, say, 64 (or 32) and then fill from the end and then take the non-zero part? But we don't know the length.\n\n  We can compute the length: L = floor(log2(real(k))) + 1\n\nBut we can avoid logs by:\n\n  s = ''\n  temp = k\n  do while (temp > 0)\n      remainder = mod(temp, 2)\n      temp = temp / 2\n      s = char(ichar('0') + remainder) // s   ! prepend the character\n  end do\n\nBut note: if k is 0, we must handle separately.\n\nThen we have the binary string s.\n\nNow, we run the DP as in the second program:\n\n  M = 1000000007\n  n = len_trim(s)   [if we built with leading zeros? Actually we built without leading zeros, so the string s is the minimal representation? But note: k=1 -> \"1\", k=2 -> \"10\", etc.]\n\n  We'll use a DP array of dimension (0:n, 0:1). We can use two arrays to represent the current state and update? Or a 2D array.\n\n  dp(0,0) = 1\n  dp(0,1) = 0\n\n  Then for each character in s (from the first to the last, i.e., left to right):\n\n      Let c = s(i:i)\n\n      Then we update dp for the next state (i+1) based on the current state (i) and the current character.\n\n      The Java code:\n\n        if (s[i] == '0') {\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n        }\n\n        if (s[i] == '0') {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        }\n\n  Then the result is (dp(n,0)+dp(n,1)) % M\n\nBut note: the Java code has two separate parts: one for the first condition and then the second condition. We must do the same.\n\nWe'll translate the DP step by step.\n\nHowever, note: the Java code uses a 2D array. We can use a 2D array in Fortran as well.\n\nSteps:\n\n  integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n  integer :: dp(0:len, 0:1)   ! but len is the length of the string s.\n\n  We'll allocate the DP array? Or we can use fixed size since the string length is at most 64.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use two state variables for the current state (carrying two values: dp0 and dp1) and update for the next.\n\n  But the problem has two states: \n      state 0: still equal to the prefix of the string (no less)\n      state 1: already less\n\n  We'll iterate over each character.\n\n  Initialize:\n      dp0 = 1   (state0 at the beginning: one way, and we haven't exceeded)\n      dp1 = 0\n\n  Then for each character c in the string (from the first to the last):\n\n      if c == '0' then\n          new_dp0 = dp0   ! because we must put 0 to match? \n          new_dp1 = dp1\n      else\n          new_dp0 = 0    ! because we cannot put 1 and still be equal? Actually, in the first condition: if the current bit is 1, then state0 cannot continue? Actually, the first condition in the Java code sets only state1 for the next state from state0 and state1? \n          new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + dp1, M)\n      end if\n\n      Then the second part:\n\n        if c == '0' then\n            new_dp1 = mod(new_dp1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n        else\n            new_dp0 = mod(new_dp0 + mod(2 * dp0, M), M)\n            new_dp1 = mod(new_dp1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n        end if\n\n      Then set dp0 = new_dp0, dp1 = new_dp1.\n\n  But wait, the Java code does:\n\n      if (s[i]=='0') {\n          // first block: \n          dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n          dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n          // then second block:\n          dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n      } else {\n          // first block: \n          dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n          // then second block:\n          dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n          dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n      }\n\n  Actually, the second block is additive to the state that was set in the first block.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if (c == '0') then\n          ! First block: state0 and state1 carry over without change? \n          temp0 = dp0\n          temp1 = dp1\n          ! Then in the second block: we add 2 * dp1 to state1? \n          next0 = temp0\n          next1 = mod(temp1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)   ? \n\n          But wait, the second block uses the current state (dp[i]) again? Actually, the second block uses the same dp[i] as the first block. So we have:\n\n          next0 = dp0   ! from the first block\n          next1 = dp1   ! from the first block\n          then we add: 2 * dp1 to next1.\n\n          So: next1 = mod(next1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n\n          But note: dp1 is the same as the current dp1? And we have not changed dp0 and dp1 for the current state.\n\n          Actually, the Java code uses the current state (at index i) for the second block. So we can do:\n\n          next0 = dp0\n          next1 = dp1\n          next1 = mod(next1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n\n      else\n          ! First block: \n          next0 = 0\n          next1 = mod(dp0 + dp1, M)\n          ! Then second block: \n          next0 = mod(next0 + mod(2 * dp0, M), M)\n          next1 = mod(next1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n      end if\n\n  Then set dp0 = next0, dp1 = next1.\n\nBut note: the second block in the '0' case uses dp1 (the current state) to multiply by 2? And then add to the next state1. Similarly, in the '1' case, we use dp0 and dp1 (the current state) to multiply by 2 and add to next0 and next1 respectively.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  if (c == '0') then\n      next0 = dp0\n      next1 = dp1\n      next1 = mod(next1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)\n  else\n      next0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)   ! because we are going to add mod(2 * dp0, M) to next0, but note next0 was set to 0? So we can do: next0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n      next1 = mod(dp0 + dp1, M)   ! this is the first block\n      next1 = mod(next1 + mod(2 * dp1, M), M)   ! so next1 becomes mod(dp0+dp1 + 2*dp1, M) = mod(dp0 + 3*dp1, M)? \n\n      Actually, wait: the first block sets next1 = dp0+dp1. Then the second block adds 2*dp0 and 2*dp1? But the second block does:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0]*2) % M\n          dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1]*2) % M\n\n      So for state0: we are adding 2 * dp0 (current state) to the next state0? But the first block set next0 to 0? Then next0 becomes 2 * dp0.\n\n      And for state1: we are adding 2 * dp1 to the next state1 (which was set to dp0+dp1). So next1 becomes dp0+dp1+2*dp1 = dp0+3*dp1? \n\n      Actually, the code:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] = 0? Then we do: dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0]*2) -> becomes 2 * dp0\n          dp[i+1][1] = dp0+dp1, then += 2 * dp1 -> becomes dp0+dp1+2*dp1 = dp0+3*dp1? \n\n      But the Java code does:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + (dp[i][0] * 2)) % M;\n          dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2)) % M;\n\n      So yes.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      if (c == '0') then\n          next0 = dp0\n          next1 = mod(dp1 * 3, M)   ! because next1 = dp1 (from first block) + 2*dp1 = 3*dp1?\n      else\n          next0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n          next1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)   ! because next1 = (dp0+dp1) + 2*dp1 = dp0 + 3*dp1\n      end if\n\n  But wait, in the '0' case: the first block sets next0=dp0 and next1=dp1, then we add 2*dp1 to next1 -> next1 = dp1 + 2*dp1 = 3*dp1? But what about the state0? The state0 remains dp0? And state0 does not get multiplied? \n\n  However, let me check the Java code again for the '0' case:\n\n      if (s[i] == '0') {\n          dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];   -> next0 = dp0\n          dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];   -> next1 = dp1\n          // then:\n          dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2) % M; \n          -> next1 = dp1 + 2 * dp1? But wait: the multiplication is by 2 and then mod, and then added to the current next1? \n\n          So next1 = dp1 + 2 * dp1 = 3 * dp1? \n\n      But note: the second block uses the same current state (dp[i]) as the first block. So the dp1 in the second block is the same as the one we used in the first block.\n\n  However, in the '0' case, the state0 is not multiplied? \n\n  Actually, the state0 is not touched in the second block for the '0' case. So next0 remains dp0.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if (c == '0') then\n          next0 = dp0\n          next1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)   ! because 3*dp1 mod M\n      else\n          next0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n          next1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)\n      end if\n\n  But wait, the '0' case: the first block sets next1 to dp1, then we add 2*dp1 -> so next1 = dp1 + 2*dp1 = 3*dp1? Yes.\n\n  However, the state0 in the '0' case remains the same? \n\n  But note: the state0 in the next state is set to the current state0? That means we are carrying the state0 from the previous state without change? \n\n  So the recurrence:\n\n      For a '0' bit:\n          state0: the next state0 is the current state0? (meaning we have to put 0 to match the string, and then the state0 remains only if we were in state0? and we put 0? And then state1: we can put 0 or 1? Actually, the second block adds 2 * dp1: that represents that we can put either 0 or 1? But only for the state1? \n\n      The problem is: the state0 means we are matching the string exactly so far. For a '0' in the string, if we are in state0 we must put 0. Then state0 continues. For state1, we can put 0 or 1? But wait, the second block in the Java code for the '0' case only adds 2 * dp1 to state1? \n\n  Actually, the original problem (ABC129 E) counts the pairs (a, b) such that a+b <= L and a XOR b = a+b. The DP state is:\n\n      dp[i][0]: the number of ways for the first i bits such that the current a+b is exactly equal to L (the given binary string) so far? \n      dp[i][1]: the number of ways such that a+b is strictly less than L so far.\n\n  And the recurrence:\n\n      For a bit in L being '0':\n          - If we are in state0 (exact match), then we must assign (a_i, b_i) such that a_i+b_i=0 (because the bit is 0). Then (a_i, b_i) can be (0,0). Then state0 remains.\n          - For state1 (already less), we can assign (0,0) and remain less? \n          - Then, the second part: for state1, we can also assign (1,0) or (0,1) but note: if we assign (1,0) or (0,1) then we get a carry? Actually, no? But wait, the problem is done bit by bit without considering carry? \n\n      Actually, the condition a+b = a XOR b means that there is no carry. Therefore, each bit must satisfy a_i and b_i are not both 1. So the pairs are (0,0), (1,0), (0,1).\n\n      For state0 at a '0' bit: we can only assign (0,0) to not exceed. Then state0 continues.\n\n      For state0 at a '1' bit: we can assign (1,0) or (0,1) and then become less? Or (0,0) and then remain state0? But wait, if we assign (0,0) to a '1' bit, then we have a+b < L? So we drop to state1? And if we assign (1,0) or (0,1) we are matching? But then we remain state0? \n\n      Actually, the problem is more complex. \n\n  However, the recurrence in the Java code is well known. We can trust the recurrence.\n\n  So we'll use the optimized recurrence:\n\n      if (c=='0') then\n          next0 = dp0\n          next1 = 3 * dp1\n      else\n          next0 = 2 * dp0\n          next1 = dp0 + 3 * dp1\n      end if\n\n  Then mod by M.\n\n  But wait, the Java code for the '1' case:\n\n      First block: next1 = dp0+dp1   -> then we add 2*dp0 and 2*dp1? \n          next0 = 0 + 2*dp0 = 2*dp0\n          next1 = (dp0+dp1) + 2*dp1 = dp0 + 3*dp1\n\n  So the optimized recurrence is as above.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      dp0_prev = dp0\n      dp1_prev = dp1\n      if (c == '0') then\n          dp0 = dp0_prev\n          dp1 = mod(3 * dp1_prev, M)\n      else\n          dp0 = mod(2 * dp0_prev, M)\n          dp1 = mod(dp0_prev + 3 * dp1_prev, M)\n      end if\n\n  Then after processing all characters, the result = mod(dp0 + dp1, M)\n\nBut note: we must initialize:\n\n      dp0 = 1, dp1 = 0\n\n  Then process each character in the binary string from left to right.\n\nNow, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  1. Read integer n.\n  2. Compute k = popcount(n) (number of ones in binary representation of n).\n  3. If k==0, then the binary string is \"0\".\n     Else, build the binary string of k (without leading zeros) in the usual big-endian order (most significant first).\n  4. Initialize dp0 = 1, dp1 = 0.\n  5. For each character in the binary string (from the first to the last):\n        if character is '0', then:\n            new_dp0 = dp0\n            new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n        else:\n            new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n            new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)\n        Then set dp0 = new_dp0, dp1 = new_dp1.\n  6. Output mod(dp0+dp1, M)\n\nBut note: the modulus operations: we do mod at every step to avoid overflow.\n\nHowever, the multiplication by 3 might be large? We do mod at each step.\n\nLet me test with a small example:\n\n  Input n=3 -> binary: 11 -> k=2 -> binary string \"10\"\n\n  Steps for the string \"10\":\n\n      First character '1': \n          dp0_prev=1, dp1_prev=0\n          then: \n            dp0 = mod(2 * 1, M) = 2\n            dp1 = mod(1 + 3*0, M) = 1\n\n      Second character '0':\n          dp0_prev=2, dp1_prev=1\n          then:\n            dp0 = 2\n            dp1 = mod(3 * 1, M) = 3\n\n      Result = (2+3) mod M = 5.\n\n  The expected result? \n\n  The problem atcoder_ABC129_E for the input \"10\" (which is 2) would give:\n\n      We are counting the pairs (a,b) such that a+b <= 2 and a XOR b = a+b.\n\n      The pairs (a,b) with a<=2, b<=2, and a+b<=2 and no carry (so a XOR b = a+b) are:\n\n          (0,0): 0+0=0 <=2 -> valid.\n          (0,1): 0+1=1 <=2 -> valid.\n          (0,2): 0+2=2 <=2 -> valid.\n          (1,0): valid.\n          (1,1): 1+1=2 -> but 1 XOR 1 = 0, which is not equal to 2? Actually, the condition is a XOR b = a+b? \n          Actually, the condition a XOR b = a+b is equivalent to (a & b) == 0? \n\n          So (1,1): has a&b=1, so not allowed.\n\n          (2,0): valid? 2+0=2 -> and 2 XOR 0 = 2, so valid.\n          (2,1): 2+1=3 -> exceeds 2? not allowed.\n\n          So the valid pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0) -> 5.\n\n      So 5 is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\nNow, write the Fortran code.\n\nNote: We must be cautious about the order of the binary string: we built it in big-endian (most significant first). Then we process from the first character (the most significant) to the last (the least significant).\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nWe assume the input integer n is nonnegative? The first Java program uses nextInt(), so n>=0.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Step 1: Read n\n  Step 2: Count the number of ones (popcount) in n.\n\n  Step 3: Convert k (the popcount) to a binary string. We handle k=0 separately.\n\n  Step 4: Apply the DP.\n\n  Step 5: Print the result.\n\nLet me write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  integer :: n, k, i, temp, remainder\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n  integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n  integer :: dp0, dp1, new_dp0, new_dp1\n  integer :: len_bin, j\n\n  ! Step 1: Read n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  ! Step 2: Compute k = popcount(n)\n  k = 0\n  temp = n\n  do while (temp > 0)\n      if (mod(temp,2) == 1) then\n          k = k + 1\n      end if\n      temp = temp / 2\n  end do\n\n  ! Now, k is the popcount. If n==0 then k==0.\n\n  ! Step 3: Convert k to a binary string (without leading zeros) in big-endian order.\n\n  if (k == 0) then\n      bin_str = \"0\"\n  else\n      ! We'll build the binary representation in reverse (least significant first) and then reverse? \n      ! Or we can build from the front? \n      ! We'll compute the length of the binary representation of k.\n      ! We can use a temporary string of length 64? \n      character(len=64) :: temp_str\n      temp = k\n      i = 64\n      temp_str = ''\n\n      do while (temp > 0)\n          remainder = mod(temp, 2)\n          if (remainder == 0) then\n              temp_str(i:i) = '0'\n          else\n              temp_str(i:i) = '1'\n          end if\n          i = i - 1\n          temp = temp / 2\n      end do\n\n      ! Then the binary string is from i+1 to 64\n      bin_str = trim(temp_str(i+1:64))\n  end if\n\n  ! Step 4: DP\n  dp0 = 1\n  dp1 = 0\n  len_bin = len(bin_str)\n\n  do j = 1, len_bin\n      if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n          new_dp0 = dp0\n          new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n      else\n          new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n          new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)\n      end if\n      dp0 = new_dp0\n      dp1 = new_dp1\n      ! We can do mod for dp0 and dp1? The recurrence already mods? But for the next step, we want them mod M? \n      ! We mod in the expressions above, so we are safe.\n  end do\n\n  ! Step 5: Output\n  write(*,*) mod(dp0 + dp1, M)\n\nBut note: the mod operation for new_dp1 in the '1' case: we did mod(dp0 + 3*dp1, M). However, dp0 and dp1 might be large? But we mod at every step.\n\nBut the expressions:\n\n  For '0': \n      new_dp0 = dp0   -> might be large? but we don't mod? Then we should mod at the end? But the recurrence in the Java code mods at every step.\n\n  We should mod at every assignment to avoid overflow.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n          new_dp0 = mod(dp0, M)   ! but dp0 is already moded? \n          new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n      else\n          new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n          new_dp1 = mod(mod(dp0, M) + mod(3 * dp1, M), M)   ? \n\n  Actually, we have been moding at every step, so dp0 and dp1 are in the range [0, M-1]. Then 3*dp1 might be up to 3*(M-1) -> which is less than 2^31? M=1000000007, so 3*(M-1) = 3000000021, which is less than 2^31 (which is about 2e9) -> actually 2^31 is 2147483648, and 3000000021 > 2147483648. So we must use mod arithmetic to avoid overflow.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(int(0, kind=8) + dp0 + 3*dp1, M)   ? \n\n  But we can break the mod:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0, M)   ! but dp0 is already moded? \n      then add mod(3*dp1, M) and mod again.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3*dp1, M)\n\n  But if dp0 and dp1 are moded (so less than M), then dp0 + 3*dp1 <= M-1 + 3*(M-1) = 4*M-4 -> which is about 4e9, which is too big for 32-bit integer? \n\n  Therefore, we must use 64-bit integers for intermediate? \n\n  Since Fortran integers might be 32-bit, we can use a 64-bit integer for the multiplication? Or we can use modulo arithmetic that avoids overflow.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod( int(dp0, 8) + 3_int64 * int(dp1, 8), M)\n\n  But we can also do:\n\n      new_dp1 = mod( dp0, M )   ! dp0 mod M is dp0\n      temp_val = 3 * dp1\n      temp_val = mod(temp_val, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod(new_dp1 + temp_val, M)\n\n  But that is for the '1' case? Actually, the expression for the '1' case is:\n\n      new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3 * dp1, M)\n\n  We can compute:\n\n      new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n      new_dp1 = mod( dp0, M )\n      new_dp1 = mod( new_dp1 + mod(3 * dp1, M), M)\n\n  But note: 3*dp1 might be huge? We do mod(3 * dp1, M) first.\n\n  Similarly, for the '0' case: \n      new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n          new_dp0 = dp0   ! but we are going to mod it? Actually, we must mod at every step? \n          new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n      else\n          new_dp0 = mod(2 * dp0, M)\n          new_dp1 = mod(3 * dp1, M)\n          new_dp1 = mod( dp0 + new_dp1, M )\n      end if\n\n  Then set dp0 = mod(new_dp0, M)   ? But for the '0' case, new_dp0 is set to dp0, which might be large? \n\n  Actually, we are doing mod at every step? So we must mod new_dp0 and new_dp1? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a 64-bit integer for the entire computation? But the problem says M=1000000007, and the numbers will be less than M? Then we can use 64-bit integers to avoid overflow in intermediate multiplications? \n\n  Since the maximum value is about 4*M (which is about 4e9) and 4e9 is within the range of 32-bit signed integer? Actually, 2^31-1 is 2147483647, which is about 2e9, so 4e9 is too big. Therefore, we must use 64-bit integers for the intermediate multiplications.\n\n  We can declare:\n\n      integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n      integer(kind=8) :: dp0, dp1, new_dp0, new_dp1   ! but then we mod by M, so the result is 32-bit? \n\n  But we can also use 64-bit integers for the state variables. Then:\n\n      dp0 = 1_8\n      dp1 = 0_8\n\n      then in the loop:\n\n          if (bin_str(j:j)=='0') then\n              new_dp0 = dp0\n              new_dp1 = 3_8 * dp1\n          else\n              new_dp0 = 2_8 * dp0\n              new_dp1 = dp0 + 3_8 * dp1\n          end if\n\n          dp0 = mod(new_dp0, M)\n          dp1 = mod(new_dp1, M)\n\n  This will avoid overflow because 3_8 * dp1: dp1 is at most M-1 (about 1e9) -> 3e9, which fits in 64-bit. Similarly, 2_8 * dp0 is at most 2e9.\n\n  Then at the end:\n\n      result = mod(dp0+dp1, M)\n\n  And output as integer.\n\n  We'll do that.\n\nBut note: the initial dp0=1, dp1=0: we can use 64-bit integers.\n\nTherefore, revised:\n\n  integer(kind=8) :: n, k, temp, remainder   ! for n, we read as integer, but we do arithmetic: use 64-bit to avoid overflow?\n  integer(kind=8) :: dp0, dp1, new_dp0, new_dp1\n  integer(kind=8) :: result\n\n  But for the popcount: n might be large? We use 64-bit for n.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      read n as 64-bit integer.\n\n      k = 0\n      temp = n\n      do while (temp > 0)\n          if (mod(temp,2) == 1) then\n              k = k + 1\n          end if\n          temp = temp / 2\n      end do\n\n  Then build the string for k (which is at most 64, so we don't need 64-bit for k? But k is the popcount, so maximum 64 for 64-bit integer? So k can be stored in 32-bit? But we are going to use k to build a string? \n\n  We'll use:\n\n      integer :: k_int = int(k)   ! but k is 64-bit? We can use k as a 32-bit integer? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do the conversion with 64-bit k? But k is at most 64, so we can do:\n\n      temp = k   ! but k is 64-bit, but we can use it as a 32-bit? \n\n  Actually, we can use k as a 32-bit integer? \n\n  To avoid confusion, we'll use:\n\n      integer :: k_int\n      k_int = int(k)   ! convert to 32-bit integer\n\n  Then build the string for k_int.\n\n  Then the DP: we use 64-bit integers for dp0, dp1.\n\n  Code:\n\n      program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, k, temp, remainder\n        integer :: k_int, i, j, len_bin\n        character(len=64) :: temp_str\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n        integer(kind=8), parameter :: M = 1000000007_8\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp0, dp1, new_dp0, new_dp1, total\n\n        !

Let len_bin = 64 - i\n            ! Then bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n            ! But we don't know the length? We can set:\n            len_bin = 64 - i\n            allocate(character(len=len_bin) :: bin_str)\n            bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 4: DP\n        dp0 = 1_8\n        dp1 = 0_8\n\n        if (allocated(bin_str)) then\n            len_bin = len(bin_str)\n        else\n            len_bin = 1\n            bin_str = '0'\n        end if\n\n        do j = 1, len_bin\n            if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n                new_dp0 = dp0\n                new_dp1 = 3_8 * dp1\n            else\n                new_dp0 = 2_8 * dp0\n                new_dp1 = dp0 + 3_8 * dp1\n            end if\n            !

Then in the loop, we have j=1: character is '0'. Then:\n\n    new_dp0 = dp0=1\n    new_dp1 = 3*dp1=0\n    then dp0=1, dp1=0.\n\n    total = 1.\n\nBut the expected result for n=0:\n\n    Step1: n=0 -> k=0.\n    Step2: bin_str=\"0\"\n    Step3: DP for \"0\": \n        state0: at the beginning: 1, state1:0.\n        Then for the character '0':\n            next0 = 1\n            next1 = 0   (because 3*0=0)\n        Then total=1.\n\n    But what is the count for the second program for the input \"0\"? \n        The pairs (a,b) such that a+b<=0? only (0,0). So 1.\n\n    So it is correct.\n\nBut note: the Java program for the first program on n=0:\n\n    n=0: the while loop doesn't run -> s is empty string -> then the for loop runs 0 times -> ans=0 -> output 0.\n\n    Then the second program reads \"0\", and outputs 1.\n\n    So the chain: input 0 -> first program outputs 0 -> second program reads \"0\" and outputs 1.\n\n    Our combined program for n=0 outputs 1.\n\n    Therefore, it matches.\n\n  However, the first program in Java for n=0 outputs 0? Then the second program would read \"0\" and output 1. So the overall output is 1.\n\n  But our first step: popcount(0)=0 -> then we run the DP on the binary representation of 0 (which is \"0\") -> which outputs 1.\n\n  So it's the same.\n\n  But wait, the first Java program for n=0:\n\n        while (n>0) ... -> doesn't run -> s is empty -> then the for loop: s.length()=0 -> ans=0 -> prints 0.\n\n  Then the second program reads \"0\" (from the output of the first) and does the DP and outputs 1.\n\n  Our combined program does the same: reads 0, then outputs 1.\n\n  Therefore, it is consistent.\n\n  We must test with n=1:\n\n      n=1: \n          popcount: 1 -> k=1 -> bin_str=\"1\"\n          DP: \n              j=1: character '1'\n                  new_dp0 = 2 * 1 = 2\n                  new_dp1 = 1 + 3*0 = 1\n              then dp0=2 mod M =2, dp1=1 mod M=1\n              total = 3.\n\n      The expected: \n          First program: n=1 -> binary \"1\" -> count=1 -> output 1.\n          Then the second program: reads the string \"1\", which is the decimal digit 1? But wait, the second program expects a binary string? \n\n      Actually, the second program reads a string of binary digits. The output of the first program is \"1\", which is a string of one character. The second program then processes the string \"1\" (which is a binary string of one bit, representing the number 1).\n\n      The DP for the string \"1\" in the second program:\n\n          n=1: \n          dp[0][0]=1, dp[0][1]=0.\n\n          i=0: s[0]='1'\n             first block: dp[1][1] = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1]) % M = 1.\n             second block: \n                 dp[1][0] += (dp[0][0]*2) % M -> 0 + 2 = 2\n                 dp[1][1] += (dp[0][1]*2) % M -> 1 + 0 = 1\n          Then result = (2+1) % M = 3.\n\n      So 3 is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  We'll write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n  Note: We must be cautious about the string allocation. We built the string for the binary representation of k_int. We did:\n\n        if (k_int==0) then\n            bin_str = '0'\n        else\n            ... build the string in temp_str and then take the substring from i+1 to 64 and assign to bin_str (with the exact length)\n\n  But we did:\n\n        len_bin = 64 - i\n        allocate(character(len=len_bin) :: bin_str)\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  However, the substring temp_str(i+1:64) has length len_bin? And we allocated bin_str to that length? Then we assign: it should work.\n\n  But note: if the substring has trailing spaces? No, because we built from i+1 to 64 and we set each character to '0' or '1'. The rest of temp_str is space? But we take exactly the substring of length len_bin.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  without trimming? And then use bin_str as is? But the length of bin_str would be 64-i? \n\n  We allocated bin_str to that length? Then we assign the substring? \n\n  Actually, we can simply do:\n\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  and then use bin_str.\n\n  But we allocated the exact length? Then the assignment should work.\n\n  However, we might not need to allocate? We can use:\n\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  but then bin_str would be of default length? We can use a deferred-length character and assign the substring? \n\n  We did: \n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n\n        ... \n\n        if (k_int==0) then\n            bin_str = '0'\n        else\n            ... \n            bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)   ! This will set bin_str to the substring? But without allocation? \n\n        end if\n\n  Actually, in Fortran 2003, you can assign a substring to an allocatable character and it will allocate to the length of the substring? \n\n  But we already built the substring? We can do:\n\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  without explicitly allocating? \n\n  Let me test: \n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n        s = 'abc'   -> allocates to length 3.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n        if (k_int==0) then\n            bin_str = '0'\n        else\n            ! ... build temp_str, then\n            bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n        end if\n\n  This will set bin_str to the substring of length (64-i) and allocate accordingly.\n\n  Therefore, we can remove the explicit allocation.\n\n  Revised:\n\n        if (k_int == 0) then\n            bin_str = '0'\n        else\n            temp_str = repeat(' ', 64)   ! we can skip? \n            temp = k_int\n            i = 64\n            do while (temp > 0)\n                ... as before\n            end do\n            bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n        end if\n\n  But note: the substring temp_str(i+1:64) might have trailing spaces? Actually, we built the string from the end, and we set the positions we used to '0' or '1', and the rest to space? Then the substring from i+1 to 64 will be the binary digits without trailing spaces? \n\n  Actually, we set the characters from i+1 to 64 to the binary digits. The rest (to the left) are spaces? Then the substring from i+1 to 64 is the binary representation without any extra spaces? \n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n        bin_str = temp_str(i+1:64)\n\n  and then len_bin = len(bin_str) will be 64-i.\n\n  But note: if the string has leading zeros? We built without leading zeros? \n\n  For example, k_int=2: \n        We set temp_str(63:63)='1', then temp_str(64:64)='0'? \n        Then i would be 62? so bin_str = temp_str(63:64) = \"10\"\n\n  That is correct.\n\n  Therefore, we'll write:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, k, temp\n        integer :: k_int, i, j, remainder\n        character(len=64) :: temp_str\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n        integer(kind=8), parameter :: M = 1000000007_8\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp0, dp1, total\n\n        read(*,*) n\n\n        !

That is correct.\n\n  However, in the expression for dp1 in the '1' case: we use the current (unmodified) dp0 and dp1. Then we update dp0. So we don't need a temporary? \n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if (bin_str(j:j) == '0') then\n            dp1 = mod(3_8 * dp1, M)\n            ! dp0 remains the same? \n        else\n            dp1 = mod(dp0 + 3_8 * dp1, M)\n            dp0 = mod(2_8 * dp0, M)\n        end if\n\n  Then after the update, dp0 and dp1 are the new state.\n\n  But note: in the '0' case, we do not change dp0?
