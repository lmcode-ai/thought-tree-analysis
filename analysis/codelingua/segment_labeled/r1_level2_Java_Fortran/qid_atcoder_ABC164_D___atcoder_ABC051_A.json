  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_ABC164_D) processes a string and computes a result (a long integer) which is printed. The second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces commas with spaces.\n\nHowever, note the requirement: the entire sequence should be translated into a single Fortran program. The first program reads a string and outputs a number. Then the second program reads a string (which in the original chain would be the next input, but here we must consider the flow).\n\nBut wait: the second program does not read a number but a string. The problem states that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. However, the first program outputs a long integer (ans) and the second program expects a string that may contain commas.\n\nThis mismatch indicates that the chain might be intended for independent inputs? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (a number) would be the input to the second? But the second program replaces commas in the input string. \n\nLooking at the second program: it simply reads a string and replaces commas with spaces. It does not use the output of the first program in any calculation. This suggests that the two programs are independent? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut the first program outputs a number and the second expects a string. How can we chain them? \n\nWe must reconsider: the problem states that we are to translate the entire sequence. The example has two programs. The first program reads a string and outputs a number. The second program reads a string and outputs a string with commas replaced by spaces.\n\nIn the chain, the output of the first (a number) would be the input to the second? But the second program expects a string that might contain commas. The number does not contain commas. So the second program would output the same number (as a string) without any change? Because there are no commas to replace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake? Or the two programs are for two different problems and the chain is not intended? \n\nBut the problem says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". So we must design a Fortran program that:\n\n1. Reads the initial input (which is a string, as in the first program).\n2. Processes it as the first program (computes the answer for the first problem, which is a long integer).\n3. Then, instead of printing, it passes that long integer as the input to the next program? But the next program expects a string. So we convert the long integer to a string and then replace commas in that string? However, the long integer doesn't have commas. So replacing commas would do nothing.\n\nBut wait: the second program is designed to read a string and output the same string with commas replaced by spaces. It doesn't matter what the string is. So if we pass the string representation of the long integer, then the second program will output that same string without any commas (so unchanged) because there are no commas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is:\n\nInput to the entire system: \n  First, a string for the first program (like \"1817181712114\").\nThen, the first program outputs a number (like 3).\nThen the second program runs with input \"3\", and outputs \"3\".\n\nBut that doesn't seem useful.\n\nAnother possibility: the two programs are independent and the chain is:\n\nThe first program runs and produces an output (a number). Then the second program runs and reads a new input (which is a string) and processes it. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nTherefore, we must design:\n\n1. Read the initial input (a string) for the first program.\n2. Process it as the first program to compute a long integer (let's call it `ans`).\n3. Then, convert `ans` to a string and pass that string to the second program? \n   The second program then replaces any commas in that string with spaces. But note: the second program reads the entire line. And the long integer might be large? But it's just a number without commas.\n\nSo the second program would output the same number as a string? Then the entire chain output is the string of the number.\n\nBut that is equivalent to just running the first program and then converting the answer to a string and printing? And then the second program is effectively a no-op for this input? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the two programs are run on two separate inputs? But the problem states the chain.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let's stick to the requirement: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nSo the Fortran program should:\n\n- Read a string (the initial input for the first program).\n- Process it as the first Java program to compute a long integer `ans`.\n- Then, convert `ans` to a string and then process that string by the second program: which is to replace commas by spaces. But since `ans` is a number without commas, the output is the same as the string representation of `ans`.\n\nTherefore, the entire program:\n\n1. Reads a string (call it S).\n2. Computes the value `ans` as in the first Java program.\n3. Converts `ans` to a string and then outputs that string (without any commas, so no change).\n\nBut note: the second Java program does a replacement and then prints. So we do the same: we output the string representation of `ans`.\n\nHowever, the first Java program also counts the empty substring? (mod_cnt[0] is incremented at the end). We'll replicate that.\n\nBut wait: what if the problem intended two separate inputs? The problem states: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program runs and produces output which is the input to the second. There is only one initial input: the string for the first program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n- Read the initial string (using read for a string).\n- Process the string to compute the long integer `ans` (as in the first Java program).\n- Then, convert `ans` to a string and output it (without any commas, because there are none, but we are effectively just printing the number).\n\nBut note: the second program replaces commas with spaces. So we must do that step. Even though there are no commas, we must replace any commas that might be present? But the string representation of an integer (in Fortran) does not include commas. So we can skip the replacement? Or do it for correctness.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if we run the two Java programs in sequence:\n\n  java atcoder_ABC164_D <<< \"1817181712114\"\n  Output: 3\n\n  Then: echo 3 | java atcoder_ABC051_A\n  Output: 3\n\nSo the final output is the string \"3\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should output the string representation of `ans` (without commas, so we don't have to do any replacement). But to be faithful, we should simulate the replacement: we take the string of `ans` and replace any commas by spaces. Since there are no commas, it remains the same.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n1. Reads a string (the initial input).\n2. Computes `ans` (a long integer) as in the first Java program.\n3. Converts `ans` to a string and then replaces every comma in that string by a space? But note: the second Java program uses `replace(\",\", \" \")` which replaces every comma by a space. However, the string representation of an integer in Fortran does not use commas. So we can skip the replacement? Or do it anyway for correctness.\n\nBut in Fortran, when we write an integer, it doesn't have commas. So the string we get from converting `ans` has no commas. Therefore, the replacement does nothing.\n\nSo we can simply write the integer? However, the second Java program writes the entire line as a string. So we must output the integer as a string without any extra formatting.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs `ans` as a long integer. The second program then reads that as a string. In Java, when you print a long, it prints without commas. So the string is just the digits.\n\nIn Fortran, we can write the integer to a string and then output that string? But we don't need to do the replacement because there are no commas. Alternatively, we can output the integer directly as an integer? But the second program in the chain would output a string. So we must output the string representation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we output the string representation of `ans` (without any extra spaces or commas) and that is the final output.\n\nHowever, the second Java program uses a `StringBuilder` and then prints. It is designed to handle a string that might have commas. So we must do the replacement? But the string we are going to output (the integer string) has no commas. So we can skip the replacement? Or we can do the replacement for safety? \n\nBut the problem says: \"behaves identically\". Since the integer string has no commas, the replacement does nothing. Therefore, we can skip the replacement step? However, to be faithful, we should do it.\n\nBut note: the second program might read a multi-line input? But the first program outputs a single integer. So we have one line.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial string (one line).\n  Step 2: Compute the integer `ans` from the first program.\n  Step 3: Convert `ans` to a string (without commas) and then replace any commas (if present) by spaces. (But there won't be any.)\n  Step 4: Output that string.\n\nBut the second Java program does not do any other processing. So we can simply output the integer as a string.\n\nBut how to convert an integer to a string in Fortran? We can use internal write.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the integer directly? But the problem says: the last block should produce output. And the last block in the chain is the second program which outputs a string. So we must output the string.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we only have one read (at the beginning) and one write (at the end).\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n\n1. Read the input string (using Fortran character variable).\n2. Process the string to compute the answer (as in the first Java program) to get a long integer (we'll use integer(kind=8) for `ans`).\n3. Convert the long integer to a string (using internal file write).\n4. Then, we must do the replacement: replace every comma in that string by a space. But note: the integer string has no commas. So we can skip? But for correctness, we do the replacement by scanning the string and replacing commas. However, the problem says the entire sequence. So we must do it.\n\nBut note: the second program replaces commas. So we must do that step.\n\nBut the integer string has no commas. So we can skip? However, to be generic and faithful, we should write a replacement step. But the problem says: \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. So we can do the replacement without I/O.\n\nSo:\n\n  character(len=100) :: str_num   ! to hold the integer string\n  write(str_num, *) ans           ! This writes with leading spaces? We must adjust.\n\nBut note: the second Java program reads the entire line. The integer we write might have leading spaces? We want the same as Java: without spaces? Actually, in Java we do `System.out.println(ans)`, which writes the integer without leading zeros and without any extra formatting. In Fortran, if we use list-directed write, we get leading spaces? But we can remove them? However, the replacement of commas does not affect spaces.\n\nBut the problem: the second program replaces commas. We don't have commas, so we just output the string? But the second program outputs the string exactly as the integer string? Not exactly: the second program outputs the entire string without any extra newline? Actually, the second Java program does `System.out.println(sb)`, which appends a newline? Actually, the original first program also uses `println`.\n\nBut the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The entire chain:\n\n  Input: a string (without spaces? without commas? we don't know) for the first program.\n  Output: a string that is the integer, then the second program outputs that integer without commas (so same) and then a newline.\n\nSo the Fortran program must output the integer string and then a newline.\n\nBut note: the second Java program uses `System.out.println(sb)`, which prints the string and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, we must output the integer string (without commas) and then a newline.\n\nBut what if the integer string has commas? It doesn't. So we can skip the replacement? However, the problem requires the entire sequence. So we must do the replacement. \n\nSo:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial string (S) of up to, say, 200000 characters? The problem doesn't specify. But the first Java program reads a string. We can assume the string length is up to 200000? But in Fortran we have to set a maximum length.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must set a maximum length for the input string. Let's assume 200000.\n\n  Step 2: Process the string to compute `ans` (as in the first Java program).\n\n  Step 3: Convert `ans` to a string. We'll use an internal write to a character variable.\n\n  Step 4: Replace every comma in that string by a space. (But note: the integer string has no commas, so this does nothing. But we do it for correctness.)\n\n  Step 5: Output the string (with the replacements) and a newline.\n\nBut note: the second Java program does not output a newline? Actually, it uses `System.out.println` which outputs the string and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, we write the string and then a newline.\n\nHow to do the replacement? We can loop over the characters of the string and replace any comma by a space.\n\nBut note: the integer string might be long? The maximum value of `ans` is about (n*(n+1))/2, where n is the length of the string (which can be 200000). Then the maximum `ans` is about 200000*200001/2 = 20000100000, which is 11 digits. So we can set the string length to 20.\n\nSo:\n\n  character(len=20) :: str_ans\n  write(str_ans, '(I0)') ans   ! This writes without leading spaces.\n\nThen, we replace commas in `str_ans`? But there are none. So we can skip? But to be safe, we do:\n\n  do i = 1, len_trim(str_ans)\n      if (str_ans(i:i) == ',') then\n          str_ans(i:i) = ' '\n      end if\n  end do\n\nBut note: the second program replaces commas by spaces. But in the integer string we don't have commas, so it does nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the loop if we know there are no commas? But the problem says to reproduce the entire sequence.\n\nSo we do the replacement.\n\nBut note: the second program does not trim the string? It replaces commas anywhere. So we do the same.\n\nNow, the first Java program:\n\n  We note the algorithm:\n\n    mod_arr[0..N-1] and mod_cnt[0..2018] (size 2019)\n    radix = 1\n    for i from 0 to N-1:\n        tmp = (digit at position N-1-i) * radix % 2019\n        if i != 0: tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n        mod_arr[i] = tmp\n        mod_cnt[tmp]++\n        radix = (radix * 10) % 2019\n\n    Then, mod_cnt[0]++   (for the empty substring? or for the case when the substring mod 2019 is 0, we add one more? Actually, the formula counts pairs (i, j) such that the substring from i to j is divisible by 2019. The trick is: if we have the same mod value at two indices, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019. Also, the mod value 0 at a single index counts as a substring that is divisible (from the beginning to that index). So mod_cnt[0] is incremented at the end to account for the empty prefix? Actually, the empty prefix is considered to have mod 0.\n\n    Then, for each mod value from 0 to 2018, we do: \n        ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2\n\n  This counts the pairs of indices (i, j) with the same mod value.\n\nWe must replicate this in Fortran.\n\nConstraints: the string length can be up to 200000? We need arrays of size 200000 and 2019.\n\nIn Fortran, we can:\n\n  integer, parameter :: max_len = 200000\n  character(len=max_len) :: S\n  integer :: mod_arr(0:max_len-1)   ! but we don't know the exact length until read\n\nBut we can read the string and then set n = len_trim(S) ? But the input string might not have spaces? The first Java program uses `sc.next()` which reads a token (without spaces). So we can read the entire line and then remove trailing spaces? But the string might have leading spaces? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nActually, the first Java program uses `sc.next()` which reads the next token (non-space). So we assume the input is a string without spaces.\n\nSo we read a non-space string? In Fortran, we can read a character variable and then adjust.\n\nBut note: the input might be long. We set a maximum length, say 200000.\n\nSteps:\n\n  program main\n      implicit none\n\n      ! Declarations\n      character(len=200000) :: S\n      integer :: n, i, tmp, radix\n      integer, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n      integer :: mod_cnt(0:2018)   ! indices 0 to 2018\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans       ! because the answer can be large\n      integer :: stat\n      character(len=100) :: buffer   ! for reading? but we read a long string.\n\n      !

But we don't know the length: we can trim to get the actual string?\n      ! However, the first Java program reads a token. So we remove trailing spaces? \n      ! Actually, we want the entire non-space token? But the input is one token? \n      ! We can read the entire line and then take the first contiguous non-space string? \n      ! But the problem says the input is one string.\n\n      ! Alternatively, we can read with format A, then set n = len_trim(S) ? \n      ! But note: the string might have leading spaces? The Java `sc.next()` skips leading spaces and then reads until next space.\n\n      ! To mimic, we read the entire line and then take the first token? \n      ! But the problem says the input is one string. So we can read the entire line and then remove any trailing spaces? \n      ! And set n = len_trim(S). Then use S(1:n) for the string.\n\n      ! Actually, we can read and then adjust the length:\n\n      n = len_trim(S)\n      ! But note: the input might have spaces at the end? The first Java program would not read them. So we read the next token? \n      ! Fortran doesn't have a direct token read for arbitrary length? \n\n      ! Since the problem says one string, we assume the input line is one string without spaces.\n\n      ! So we set n = len_trim(S) and then use S(1:n).\n\n      ! Allocate mod_arr for 0 to n-1? Actually, we can use an array of size n.\n      allocate(mod_arr(0:n-1))\n\n      ! Initialize mod_cnt to 0\n      mod_cnt = 0\n\n      radix = 1\n      ! We traverse from the last character to the first? \n      ! The Java program: for i=0 to n-1: \n      !   char at n-1-i (so starting from the last character)\n\n      do i = 0, n-1\n          ! Get the digit at position n-1-i (0-indexed in the string, but Fortran is 1-indexed)\n          ! The character at position: n - i (because the string is S(1:n), so the last character is at n, then n-1, ...)\n          tmp = ichar(S(n-i:n-i)) - ichar('0')\n          tmp = tmp * radix\n          tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n\n          if (i > 0) then\n              tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n          end if\n\n          mod_arr(i) = tmp\n          mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n          radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n      end do\n\n      mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1   ! increment mod_cnt[0] by one\n\n      ans = 0\n      do i = 0, 2018\n          ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) / 2\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, ans is the integer we want to pass to the second program.\n\n      ! Step for the second program: convert ans to string and replace commas by spaces.\n      write(str_ans, '(I0)') ans   ! I0 writes without leading spaces.\n\n      ! Now, replace commas in str_ans by spaces? But there are none. But we do:\n      do j = 1, len_trim(str_ans)\n          if (str_ans(j:j) == ',') then   ! but note: Fortran doesn't use commas in integer output? \n              str_ans(j:j) = ' '\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the string and a newline? \n      ! But note: the second program outputs the entire string and then a newline.\n      write(*, '(A)') trim(str_ans)\n\n      deallocate(mod_arr)\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: the modulus operations: when we do `mod(tmp, 2019)`, we might get negative? But in our case, `tmp` is nonnegative? \n\n  tmp = digit * radix, both nonnegative? But radix might be negative? No, because we start at 1 and then mod 2019. So always nonnegative.\n\n  Also, when adding mod_arr(i-1) (which is mod 2019, so in [0,2018]), then mod again.\n\nBut note: in Fortran, mod is nonnegative? Yes, for positive modulus.\n\nBut what about: \n  tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n  We can use modulo? or mod? mod is nonnegative for positive arguments.\n\nBut if tmp + mod_arr(i-1) is negative? It won't be.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut note: the multiplication and addition might be large? The digit is 0-9, radix is mod 2019 (so at most 2018), so tmp is at most 9*2018 = 18162, then adding mod_arr(i-1) (at most 2018) -> at most 20180. So mod 2019 is safe.\n\nAlso, radix is updated by: radix = mod(radix*10, 2019) -> always in [0,2018].\n\nNow, the array mod_arr: we only use the immediate previous element? So we don't need the entire array? We can use a scalar for the previous value? \n\nBut note: we store in mod_arr[i] and then we use it for the next iteration? And then we also use it for mod_cnt? But after we store, we don't use it again until the next iteration? Actually, we only need the previous element? So we can avoid the array? \n\nBut then we cannot go back to use the entire array? Actually, we only use mod_arr[i] for the next iteration and then we store it in mod_cnt. So we can do:\n\n  integer :: prev = 0   ! for the previous mod_arr[i-1]\n  do i = 0, n-1\n      tmp = ... \n      if (i>0) then\n          tmp = mod(tmp + prev, 2019)\n      end if\n      mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n      prev = tmp\n      radix = mod(radix*10, 2019)\n  end do\n\nBut note: the first element (i=0) is stored and then used for i=1? So yes, we can avoid the array.\n\nSo we change:\n\n  integer :: current\n\n  mod_cnt = 0\n  radix = 1\n  current = 0   ! for the previous value? but for i=0, we don't add previous.\n\n  do i = 1, n   ! we can do from 1 to n? but the positions: we are processing from the last character to the first.\n\n  Actually, the original loop index i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      position = n-1-i (in Java, 0-indexed). In Fortran, we have the string S(1:n). The last character is at n, then n-1, ... \n\n      i=0 -> character at n (last)\n      i=1 -> character at n-1 (second last)\n\n  We can change the loop to:\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          j = n - i + 1   ! the character position: for i=1, j=n; i=2, j=n-1; ... i=n, j=1.\n\n  Then:\n\n      tmp = ichar(S(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n      tmp = tmp * radix\n      tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n\n      if (i > 1) then   ! because i=1 is the first iteration (like i=0 in Java) then no previous\n          tmp = mod(tmp + current, 2019)\n      end if\n\n      current = tmp\n      mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n      radix = mod(radix*10, 2019)\n\n  End do\n\n  Then after the loop, we do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1.\n\nBut note: the original Java loop does n iterations. This also does n iterations.\n\nSo we can avoid allocating an array of size n.\n\nWe'll do that.\n\nAlso, note: the radix starts at 1 and then for the next digit it becomes 10, then 100 mod 2019, etc.\n\nSo the updated Fortran code:\n\n  program main\n      implicit none\n\n      character(len=200000) :: S\n      integer :: n, i, j, tmp, radix, current\n      integer :: mod_cnt(0:2018) = 0   ! initialize to zero\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans\n      character(len=20) :: str_ans\n      integer :: pos\n\n      ! Read the input string\n      read(*, '(A)') S\n      n = len_trim(S)   ! get the actual length without trailing spaces\n\n      mod_cnt = 0\n      radix = 1\n      current = 0\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          ! j is the position in the string: from the last to the first.\n          j = n - i + 1\n          tmp = ichar(S(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n          tmp = mod(tmp * radix, 2019)\n\n          if (i > 1) then\n              tmp = mod(tmp + current, 2019)\n          end if\n\n          current = tmp\n          mod_cnt(current) = mod_cnt(current) + 1\n          radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n      end do\n\n      mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1   ! for the empty substring\n\n      ans = 0\n      do i = 0, 2018\n          if (mod_cnt(i) > 0) then\n              ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) / 2\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Convert ans to string\n      write(str_ans, '(I0)') ans   ! I0 format: minimal width\n\n      ! Replace commas by spaces in str_ans? \n      ! But note: the integer string has no commas. But we do it for correctness.\n      do i = 1, len_trim(str_ans)\n          if (str_ans(i:i) == ',') then\n              str_ans(i:i) = ' '\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output\n      write(*, '(A)') trim(str_ans)\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: the division by 2 in the sum: \n  ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) / 2\n\nIn Java, this is integer division? But mod_cnt(i) is integer, so the entire expression is integer. In Fortran, if we do:\n\n  ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) / 2\n\nBut note: the multiplication might be even? Because it's the product of two consecutive integers. So it's divisible by 2. But integer division truncates? But when the numbers are even, it's exact.\n\nBut to avoid any issue, we can do:\n\n  ans = ans + ( int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) ) / 2\n\nBut the multiplication might be large? mod_cnt(i) can be at most 200000, then 200000 * 199999 is about 40e9, which fits in int64? (since 40e9 is 4e10, and int64 max is 9e18). So it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  ans = ans + ( int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) ) / 2_8\n\nBut integer division by 2 in Fortran truncates? But the product is even, so it's exact.\n\nBut note: if mod_cnt(i) is 0 or 1, then the term is 0.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  do i = 0, 2018\n      if (mod_cnt(i) >= 2) then\n          ans = ans + ( int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * (mod_cnt(i)-1) ) / 2\n      end if\n  end do\n\nBut it's the same.\n\nNow, test with a small example? We don't have time, but we trust.\n\nOne more issue: the string might be empty? Then n=0. The loop from 1 to 0? It doesn't run. Then we do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0)+1 -> becomes 1. Then the ans: for i=0: mod_cnt[0]=1 -> term=0. Then output 0.\n\nWhich is correct? For an empty string, there is no non-empty substring divisible by 2019? But note: the empty substring? The problem counts the empty substring? Actually, the original Java program increments mod_cnt[0] at the end. So the empty substring is counted? But then the formula counts pairs: the empty substring with itself? Actually, the formula counts pairs of indices (i, j) with the same mod value. The mod value 0 is achieved by the empty prefix at the beginning (index0) and then also at the end? Actually, the algorithm uses a prefix sum.\n\nBut without any character, the mod_arr is not computed? Then mod_cnt[0] is incremented to 1. Then the formula: 1*0/2 = 0.\n\nBut the empty substring? The problem might not consider the empty substring? But the original problem (ABC164_D) is about counting the number of contiguous subsequences (which can be empty? usually contiguous subsequences are non-empty?).\n\nLooking at the problem: ABC164_D \"Multiple of 2019\". The problem says: \n  \"How many contiguous subsequences of S, consisting of at least one character, are multiples of 2019?\"\n\nSo the empty substring is not counted.\n\nBut the algorithm in the first Java program: \n\n  It does mod_cnt[0]++ at the end. Why?\n\n  Explanation: \n    The algorithm uses the idea: \n        Let P[0]=0, P[i] = (S[0..i-1] as a number) mod 2019.\n        Then a substring from i to j-1 is (P[j] - P[i]) * 10^(??) mod 2019? \n\n  Actually, the common solution for this problem is to use the fact that if two prefix sums (mod 2019) are equal, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019.\n\n  And the empty prefix (P[0]) is considered 0.\n\n  So the algorithm counts pairs (i, j) with i<j such that P[i] = P[j]. Then the number of such pairs is the answer.\n\n  And then the mod_cnt[0] is incremented to account for the empty prefix? Actually, the empty prefix is already included: P[0]=0. So if we have a prefix at index k that is 0, then we count the pair (0, k). \n\n  Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n  In the empty string case: \n      We have only the empty prefix: P[0]=0. Then mod_cnt[0] is incremented to 1 (from the initial 0) at the end. Then the pairs: mod_cnt[0]=1 -> 1*0/2 = 0.\n\n  So the answer is 0.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran code handles the empty string.\n\nNow, we write the code accordingly.\n\nBut note: the string might be very long? 200000 characters. The radix variable: we do mod 2019 at every step, so it stays within 0..2018.\n\nThe variable `current` is also mod 2019, so within 0..2018.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nFinal code:\n\n  We set the string length to 200000.\n\n  We read the entire line and then use the trimmed length.\n\n  We assume the input has no spaces? But if there are leading spaces, then the Java program would skip. In Fortran, when we read with format A, we get the entire line including leading spaces? Then `len_trim` removes trailing spaces? But we want the first token? \n\n  The problem says: the first program uses `sc.next()`. So we might need to read the first token? \n\n  How to read the first token in Fortran? We can read the entire line and then find the first non-space and then the next space? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      read(*, *) S   ! list-directed read: it will read one token? \n\n  But the token might be up to 200000 characters? And list-directed read stops at space.\n\n  But the problem says the string is one token. So we can do:\n\n      read(*, *) S   ! this reads the first token into S.\n\n  Then, we set n = len_trim(S) ? But if the token is exactly 200000, then no trailing space? So we can use:\n\n      read(*, *) S\n      n = len_trim(S)\n\n  But if the token is less than 200000, then the rest of S is filled with spaces? and len_trim returns the length without trailing spaces.\n\n  But then the string we have is S(1:n) without trailing spaces? and without leading spaces? Actually, the list-directed read skips leading spaces and then reads until space or end.\n\n  So we have the token in S(1:n) with n = len_trim(S) (but since we read one token, there are no trailing spaces? Actually, the variable S is 200000 characters long, so after the token, there are spaces? Then len_trim returns the length of the token.\n\n  So we can do that.\n\n  Therefore, we change the read to list-directed.\n\nBut note: the token might be longer than 200000? Then we are in trouble. But the problem says maximum length? We assume 200000 is enough.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the entire line and then extract the first token? But that is more complex.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n      character(len=200000) :: S\n      read(*, *) S   ! reads one token\n      n = len_trim(S)\n\nBut what if the token is exactly 200000? Then n=200000? Because there are no trailing spaces? Actually, if the token is 200000, then S is exactly the token without any trailing space? Then len_trim returns 200000.\n\n  Because the token is stored in S and then the rest of the 200000 characters are not used? Actually, no: the token is stored from the beginning. If the token is 200000, then S is full and there are no trailing spaces? So len_trim(S) would be 200000.\n\n  But if the token is 100, then S(1:100) is the token and S(101:200000) are spaces? Then len_trim(S) returns 100.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\nFinal code:\n\n  program main\n      implicit none\n      character(len=200000) :: S\n      integer :: n, i, j, tmp, radix, current\n      integer :: mod_cnt(0:2018) \n      integer(kind=8) :: ans, term\n      character(len=50) :: str_ans   ! 50 is enough for a 64-bit integer (max 20 digits)\n      integer :: k\n\n      !

If not the first iteration, add the previous current value\n          if (i > 1) then\n              tmp = mod(tmp + current, 2019)\n          end if\n\n          current = tmp\n          mod_cnt(current) = mod_cnt(current) + 1\n          radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n      end do\n\n      ! Account for the empty prefix\n      mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n      ans = 0\n      do i = 0, 2018\n          if (mod_cnt(i) >= 2) then\n              term = mod_cnt(i)\n              term = term * (term - 1) / 2\n              ans = ans + term\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Convert ans to a string\n      write(str_ans, '(I0)') ans   ! I0: minimum width\n\n      ! Replace every comma in str_ans by a space\n      do k = 1, len(str_ans)\n          if (str_ans(k:k) == ',') then\n              str_ans(k:k) = ' '\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the string (trimmed to remove leading spaces? but I0 has no leading spaces) and a newline\n      write(*, '(A)') trim(str_ans)\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: the variable `term` is int64? We defined it as integer(kind=8). Actually, we defined `ans` as int64, and `term` should be too? But mod_cnt(i) is integer (default kind). So when we assign `term = mod_cnt(i)`, it becomes int64? Then the multiplication is int64? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n      term = int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8)\n\nBut we did:\n\n      term = mod_cnt(i)   ! then term is int64? because we declared it as integer(kind=8) ? \n\nYes, because we declared `term` as integer(kind=8).\n\nBut we did not declare `term`? We did:\n\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans, term\n\nYes.\n\nWe also note: the string conversion: the format '(I0)' writes the integer without leading spaces. So we get the exact digit string.\n\nThen we replace commas? (which won't appear) and then output.\n\nThis should be equivalent to the chain.\n\nLet's test with a small input: \"1817181712114\" (which is the sample for the first program).\n\nThe first program: outputs 3.\n\nThen the second program: input \"3\", outputs \"3\".\n\nSo the Fortran program should output \"3\".\n\nWe can run the Fortran program with input \"1817181712114\" and see if it outputs \"3\".\n\nWe'll trust the algorithm of the first program.\n\nTherefore, the code is as above.\n\nNote: We use `character(len=50) :: str_ans` to be safe for large integers (up to 20 digits).\n\nWe write the entire program.\n\nOne more: the modulus operation might be done with negative? We use mod which returns a nonnegative result for positive modulus? Because the arguments are nonnegative.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we output the code."
