  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_ABC128_C) reads integers N and M, then builds a list `a` of integers of size N (each element is a bitmask of switches for M conditions). Then it reads M integers for `p` (a bitmask for the desired outcome). It then iterates over all possible subsets of switches (represented by bitmask `s` from 0 to (1<<N)-1) and for each subset, it computes `t` by XORing the elements of `a` at the positions where the bit in `s` is set. If `t` equals `p`, it counts that subset. Finally, it outputs the count.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC120_C) reads a string and uses a stack to count the number of adjacent pairs that are different (specifically, '0' and '1') and then outputs twice the count (because each removal removes two elements).\n\nHowever, note the sequence: The output of the first program is an integer (the count) and that integer is the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string. \n\nLooking at the second program: \n  Input: a string (from System.in) that is read by `in.next()`.\n\nBut the first program outputs an integer (via `System.out.println(ans)`). \n\nSo the chain would be: \n  First program: reads integers and outputs an integer (say `ans`).\n  Second program: reads a string. But if the output of the first program is an integer, then the input to the second program would be that integer as a string.\n\nBut the second program is designed to count the number of removable pairs in a string of 0s and 1s. How can we chain them?\n\nActually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input string to the second program.\n\nExample: \n  If the first program outputs 10, then the input to the second program is the string \"10\". \n\nBut the second program counts adjacent pairs of different bits. In the string \"10\", there is one adjacent pair (1 and 0) which is removable. Then it outputs 2 (because c=1, and then c*2=2).\n\nHowever, note that the second program expects a string of arbitrary length of 0s and 1s. The output of the first program is an integer, which when converted to a string is a sequence of digits (base 10). But the second program is looking for only the characters '0' and '1'. \n\nThis mismatch suggests that the two programs are not intended to be chained in this way? But the problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nBut note: the two programs are independent and do not share the same logic. The problem does not specify how the output of the first is used as input to the second. However, the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s? But the first program outputs an integer in base 10. \n\nThis seems problematic. Let me reexamine the problem: \n  \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\nBut the second program (atcoder_ABC120_C) reads a string of 0s and 1s. The example in the code is a string of 0s and 1s. The first program outputs an integer (which is a base10 number). \n\nThis implies that the output of the first program (the integer) must be converted to a binary string? Or perhaps the problem intended two separate programs? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have provided two independent programs and we are to chain them arbitrarily? But the example input for the second program is a string of 0s and 1s, and the first program does not output a binary string.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are to run the entire sequence. So the input to the entire sequence is the input for the first program (N, M, and then the switches and the pattern p). Then the output of the first program (an integer) is passed as a string of digits (in base10) to the second program. The second program then processes that base10 string as if it were a string of 0s and 1s? That doesn't make sense because the base10 string might contain digits other than 0 and 1.\n\nThis seems like a mistake. However, let me check the original problems:\n\nFirst program: atcoder_ABC128_C\n  Problem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc128/tasks/abc128_c\n  Input: \n    First line: N and M (two integers)\n    Then M lines: first integer k, then k integers (the switches connected to that bulb)\n    Then a line of M integers (each 0 or 1) for p.\n\n  Output: the number of switch patterns that turn on all bulbs.\n\nSecond program: atcoder_ABC120_C\n  Problem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc120/tasks/abc120_c\n  Input: a string of 0s and 1s\n  Output: the maximum number of removals (each removal removes two adjacent different characters) * 2.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is an integer (say 3) and then the second program would get the string \"3\". The second program would then look for adjacent pairs of different characters. In the string \"3\", there is only one character so no removal. Then output 0.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended that the output of the first program is taken as a binary number? But the output is printed in base10.\n\nI suspect that the two programs are independent and the problem statement is about two separate chains? But the problem says \"entire sequence\".\n\nAfter reconsideration, I notice that the problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". It is possible that the two programs are meant to be run on the same input? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the first program is the input to the second, but the second program is actually designed to process the output of the first? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the chain is as follows:\n  Step 1: Run the first program (atcoder_ABC128_C) on the input (which is integers N, M, then the switch descriptions and the pattern p). It produces an integer (say `ans1`).\n  Step 2: Convert `ans1` to a string (in base10) and use that string as the input to the second program (atcoder_ABC120_C). The second program then processes that string and produces an integer (say `ans2`).\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program should:\n  - Read the input for the first program (N, M, then the M lines of switch data, then the M integers for p).\n  - Compute the result of the first program (ans1).\n  - Convert ans1 to a string (in base10) and then process that string as in the second program to compute ans2 (which is the final output).\n\nBut note: the second program uses a stack to remove adjacent pairs of '0' and '1'. However, the string we are processing is the base10 representation of ans1, which may contain digits from '0' to '9'. The second program's logic is: remove adjacent pairs of different bits? Actually, the original second program is for a string of 0s and 1s. But the problem says: the second program is atcoder_ABC120_C, which is about a string of 0s and 1s.\n\nTherefore, if we pass a base10 string that might contain digits other than 0 and 1, the second program will still run, but it will only remove adjacent pairs of '0' and '1'? Actually, the second program's condition is:\n   if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1'))\nThis condition only triggers for the pairs (1,0) and (0,1). For any other adjacent pair (like '2' and '3') it will not remove.\n\nBut note: the second program's input is arbitrary? The problem says the input is a string of 0s and 1s? But in our chain, we are giving it a base10 string. This is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think there might be a misunderstanding. However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must do exactly that: the output of the first program (as a string) is the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, we will:\n  1. Read the input for the first program (N, M, and then the M lines of data).\n  2. Compute the integer result of the first program (ans1).\n  3. Convert ans1 to a string (in base10) to get a string S.\n  4. Apply the second program's logic to the string S (which is a base10 string, so it has digits in '0'..'9').\n\nThe second program's logic: \n   We use a stack. For each character in S:\n        push the character\n        while the stack has at least two elements:\n            pop the top two (call the top one p and the one below q)\n            if (p,q) is either ('0','1') or ('1','0') then we remove them (and count one removal) and continue to check the next two at the top?\n            else, push them back and break.\n\n   Then the result is the count of removals multiplied by 2.\n\nBut note: the original second program does:\n        s.push(x.charAt(i));\n        while (s.size() > 1) {\n            Character p = s.pop();\n            Character q = s.pop();\n            if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1')) {\n                c++;\n                continue;   // meaning we leave them removed and check the next top two?\n            } else {\n                s.push(q);\n                s.push(p);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\nActually, it breaks after one check? So it only checks the top two? Then moves to the next character.\n\nBut the problem in ABC120_C is about a string of 0s and 1s, and the removals can be done arbitrarily? Actually, the problem allows removals in any order. The algorithm in the second program is simulating a stack: each time we push a new character, we check the top two and if they are removable we remove them and then we can continue checking the new top two? Actually, the inner while loop continues until the top two are not removable.\n\nSo the algorithm for the second program is:\n   Initialize an empty stack and a counter c=0.\n   For each character in the string:\n        push the current character\n        while the stack has at least two and the top two are removable (i.e., one is '0' and the other is '1'):\n            pop them and increment c (by one removal, which removes two characters)\n        (if not removable, then break the while and move to next character)\n\n   Then output c * 2.\n\nBut note: the condition is only for the pair (0,1) or (1,0). In our base10 string, we might have pairs like ('2','3') which are not removable.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N, M, then the M lines: each line starts with k, then k integers, then the M integers for p).\n  Step 2: Compute the first program's result (ans1) as an integer.\n  Step 3: Convert ans1 to a string (base10) -> let this string be S.\n  Step 4: Process the string S with the stack-based removal algorithm, but note that the removal condition is only for the pairs (0,1) and (1,0). Other pairs (like (2,3)) are not removed.\n\n  Step 5: Output the result of step 4 (which is c * 2).\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we must read the input only at the beginning and write the output only at the end.\n\nBut note: the first program's input is multiple integers. We must read them all at the beginning.\n\nLet's design the Fortran program:\n\n  We'll read the integers N and M.\n  Then we'll read M lines. Each line: first integer k, then k integers (each is a switch index, and we subtract 1 to make it 0-indexed).\n\n  Then we read M integers (the pattern p).\n\n  Then we compute the first part:\n\n      We represent the list `a` as an array of integers (size N) initialized to 0.\n      For i in [0, M-1] (0-indexed in Fortran we use 1-indexed? but we can adjust):\n          read k\n          then for j in 1 to k:\n               read an integer s, then set a(s-1) = a(s-1) OR (1 shifted left by i)   [but note: i is from 0 to M-1]\n\n      Then read M integers for the pattern p: \n          p = 0\n          for i in 0 to M-1:\n             read x\n             p = p OR (x * (2**i))   [but note: in the Java code, it's p |= (x << i)]\n\n      Then we iterate over all subsets s from 0 to (2**N - 1):\n          t = 0\n          for i in 0 to N-1:\n             if the i-th bit of s is set, then t = XOR(t, a(i))\n          if t == p then count++\n\n      Then we have ans1 = count.\n\n  Then we convert ans1 to a string (base10) -> let this be S.\n\n  Then we process the string S with a stack:\n\n      We'll simulate a stack (using an array of characters or a string as a stack?).\n\n      Let len = len_trim(S)  [if we use a character array, we can track the top]\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a stack array and a pointer for the top.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        top = 0\n        c = 0\n        stack: character array, say of size 100 (but we don't know the length of S, which is at most the number of digits of (2**N) which is about N*log10(2) -> say 100 is safe? But N is up to 10, so 2**10=1024 -> 4 digits. Actually, the problem says N and M up to 10, so ans1 is at most 2**10=1024 -> 4 digits. So we can use a fixed size.\n\n        Do i = 1, len_trim(S)\n            top = top + 1\n            stack(top) = S(i:i)\n            do while (top >= 2)\n                p = stack(top)   [the top]\n                q = stack(top-1) [the one below]\n                if ( (p=='0' .and. q=='1') .or. (p=='1' .and. q=='0') ) then\n                    c = c + 1\n                    top = top - 2   [remove the two]\n                else\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n        End do\n\n        Then the result is c * 2.\n\n  Then output the result.\n\nBut note: the above stack simulation is not exactly the same as the Java program. The Java program pops the top two and then if removable, it removes and continues (without pushing them back). But if not removable, it pushes them back and breaks the inner while.\n\nHowever, in the above, we are not pushing back when we break? Actually, we don't need to push back because we break and then the stack remains as is. But in the above, we are storing the stack in an array. When we break, we leave the two elements (q and p) in the stack? Actually, we did not remove them. So we break and then move to the next character.\n\nBut in the Java program, when it breaks, it pushes them back. In our simulation, we never removed them? So we don't need to push back. We just break.\n\nBut in our code above, we are checking the top two and if they are removable, we remove and continue. If not, we break. So it's the same.\n\nHowever, in the Java program, the stack is maintained and when we break, the two elements are still there? Actually, the Java program does:\n\n   pop the top two -> now they are removed from the stack.\n   if removable: then we don't push them back and continue (so they are gone) and then we check the next top two (if any).\n   if not removable: we push them back (so the stack is restored) and break.\n\nBut in our simulation, we are only looking at the top two without popping? Actually, we are not popping until we remove. So we must simulate:\n\n   We have the current stack (with top elements). We check the top two without popping? Actually, we are storing the stack in an array. We can check stack(top) and stack(top-1). Then if they are removable, we set top = top-2 and continue. Otherwise, we break.\n\nThis is equivalent to the Java program: because in the Java program, if they are removable, they are popped and gone (so we do top=top-2). If not, they are pushed back (so the stack remains the same) and we break.\n\nSo the algorithm for the stack is:\n\n   top = 0\n   c = 0\n   do i = 1, len_trim(S)\n        top = top + 1\n        stack(top) = S(i:i)\n        do while (top >= 2)\n            if ( (stack(top)=='0' .and. stack(top-1)=='1') .or. (stack(top)=='1' .and. stack(top-1)=='0') ) then\n                c = c + 1\n                top = top - 2\n            else\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n   end do\n\nBut note: the condition in the Java program is:\n   (p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1')\nIn our condition, we have the top element as stack(top) and the one below as stack(top-1). The Java program pops the top (p) and then the next (q). So the top was the last pushed (the current character) and the next is the previous top. In our array, the current character is at the top (index top) and the previous top is at top-1. So the condition is:\n\n   (stack(top) is '1' and stack(top-1) is '0') OR (stack(top) is '0' and stack(top-1) is '1').\n\nSo our condition is correct.\n\nFinally, we output c * 2.\n\nBut note: the Fortran program must not have any I/O in the middle.\n\nWe assume that the input for the first program is read from standard input, and the final result is written to standard output.\n\nLet's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nWe need to consider the maximum values: \n   N and M are at most 10 -> so the bitmask for subsets is 0 to 2^10-1 (1023).\n\nWe'll use:\n\n   integer :: N, M\n   integer, dimension(10) :: a   ! since N<=10, we can have 10 elements\n   integer :: p, i, j, k, s_val, t_val, ans1, c, x, bit, lenS, top, removals\n   character(len=100) :: S  ! to hold the string representation of ans1\n   character(len=1) :: stack(100)  ! stack for the string processing\n   integer :: ios\n\n   ! Read N and M\n   read(*,*) N, M\n\n   ! Initialize a to 0\n   a = 0\n\n   do i = 0, M-1   ! we will loop M times, i from 0 to M-1\n        read(*,*) k\n        do j = 1, k\n            read(*,*) x\n            x = x - 1   ! convert to 0-indexed\n            a(x) = ior(a(x), ishft(1, i))   ! set the i-th bit (if i is from 0 to M-1)\n        end do\n   end do\n\n   ! Read the pattern p\n   p = 0\n   do i = 0, M-1\n        read(*,*) x\n        if (x == 1) then\n            p = ior(p, ishft(1, i))\n        end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Now iterate over all subsets s_val from 0 to (2**N - 1)\n   ans1 = 0\n   do s_val = 0, (2**N - 1)\n        t_val = 0\n        do i = 0, N-1\n            if (btest(s_val, i)) then   ! if the i-th bit is set in s_val\n                t_val = ieor(t_val, a(i))\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (t_val == p) then\n            ans1 = ans1 + 1\n        end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Convert ans1 to a string\n   write(S, '(I0)') ans1   ! This writes the integer without extra spaces\n\n   ! Now, process the string S with the stack algorithm\n   removals = 0\n   top = 0\n   lenS = len_trim(S)\n\n   do i = 1, lenS\n        ! Push the character\n        top = top + 1\n        stack(top) = S(i:i)\n\n        ! Check the top two repeatedly\n        do while (top >= 2)\n            if ( (stack(top) == '0' .and. stack(top-1) == '1') .or. &\n                 (stack(top) == '1' .and. stack(top-1) == '0') ) then\n                removals = removals + 1\n                top = top - 2   ! remove the two\n            else\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n   end do\n\n   ! The result for the second part is removals * 2\n   write(*,*) removals * 2\n\nHowever, note: the Java program for the second part uses a while loop that continues until no more removals at the top? But we break when we find a non-removable pair. Then we move to the next character. But the next character might cause a removal that then allows more removals? Actually, the algorithm in the Java program is:\n\n   for each char in the string:\n        push char\n        while (stack has at least two) and the top two are removable -> remove and continue (and then the stack might have two again? because after removal, the one below the removed pair becomes the new top? and then we can check again).\n\nSo we must use:\n\n        do while (top >= 2)\n            if removable -> remove and then we don't break, we check again the new top two (if any).\n            else break.\n\nBut in our code above, we do:\n\n        do while (top>=2)\n            if removable -> remove and then top becomes top-2 -> then we check again (because the condition is at the top of the loop: top>=2 and we now have top = top-2, so if top>=2 we continue checking the new top two).\n            else break.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut note: after removing, we reduce top by 2. Then the loop condition is checked again (top>=2). So we might remove multiple times in a row.\n\nThis matches the Java program.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program is as above.\n\nBut note: Fortran indexing and bit operations. We use:\n\n   a(x) = ior(a(x), ishft(1, i))   -> but note: ishft(1, i) shifts 1 left by i bits? Yes.\n\n   Similarly, p = ior(p, ishft(x, i)) but note: in the reading of p, we read an integer x (0 or 1) and then set the i-th bit to x. But if x is 1, then we set the bit; if x is 0, we don't. So we can do:\n\n        p = p + ishft(x, i)   -> but if x is 0, then it doesn't change. However, the ior with 0 is the same. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (x==1) p = ibset(p, i)\n\n   But note: the Java code does: p |= (x << i). So if x is 1, then we set the i-th bit; if x is 0, then we set 0.\n\n   We can do: p = ior(p, ishft(x, i))   because if x is 0, then ishft(0,i)=0, and ior(p,0)=p. If x is 1, then we get the bit set.\n\n   However, note: ishft(1, i) is a shift of 1 by i bits. But ishft(x, i) would shift the integer x by i bits. If x is 1, then we get 2^i. If x is 0, then 0.\n\n   But the pattern p is built by: for i=0 to M-1, the i-th bit is set to the i-th integer x.\n\n   So we can do: p = ior(p, ishft(x, i))\n\n   But note: the shift count must be nonnegative and within the bit size. Since M<=10, i is from 0 to 9.\n\n   However, if we use ishft(x, i) and x is 0, then it's 0. If x is 1, then it's 2^i. Then we OR them.\n\n   But the OR of the bits is the same as setting the bit if x is 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the ibset function, which sets a bit. But we would have to conditionally set.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        read(*,*) x\n        if (x == 1) then\n            p = ibset(p, i)\n        end if\n\n   But note: the ibset function sets the bit at position i (which is 0-indexed in the bit position, but Fortran bit positions are 0-indexed from the least significant bit). This is consistent.\n\n   So either way is fine.\n\nWe'll use the ibset for clarity.\n\nBut note: the first part uses ishft(1, i) to set the bit in a. This is equivalent to 2**i. And then we OR. So it's the same.\n\nNow, the subset iteration: \n\n   do s_val = 0, (2**N - 1)\n\n   But note: 2**N is an integer exponentiation. Since N<=10, it's safe.\n\n   Then for each i from 0 to N-1, we check the i-th bit of s_val with btest(s_val, i). Then we XOR the a(i) to t_val.\n\n   The XOR: t_val = ieor(t_val, a(i))\n\n   Then compare t_val and p.\n\nFinally, note: the string conversion: we use write(S, '(I0)') ans1. This writes the integer without leading zeros and without spaces.\n\nThen we process the string.\n\nWe'll write the entire Fortran program accordingly.\n\nWe assume that the input integers are provided in the same format as the first program expects.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nImportant: We must declare variables appropriately.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n   program main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: N, M, i, j, k, x, s_val, t_val, ans1, removals, top, lenS, bit_index\n   integer, dimension(10) :: a   ! because N<=10\n   integer :: p\n   character(len=100) :: S\n   character(len=1) :: stack(100)\n   integer :: temp\n\n   ! Read N and M\n   read(*,*) N, M\n\n   ! Initialize a to 0\n   a = 0\n\n   ! Loop for M switches\n   do i = 0, M-1\n        read(*,*) k\n        do j = 1, k\n            read(*,*) x\n            x = x - 1   ! 0-indexed index for the array a\n            ! Set the i-th bit in a(x)\n            a(x) = ibset(a(x), i)   ! i is the bit position (0-indexed)\n        end do\n   end do\n\n   ! Read the pattern p (M integers)\n   p = 0\n   do i = 0, M-1\n        read(*,*) x\n        if (x == 1) then\n            p = ibset(p, i)\n        end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Now iterate over all subsets: s_val from 0 to 2**N - 1\n   ans1 = 0\n   do s_val = 0, 2**N - 1\n        t_val = 0\n        do bit_index = 0, N-1\n            if (btest(s_val, bit_index)) then\n                t_val = ieor(t_val, a(bit_index+1))   ! because a is 1-indexed array? \n            end if\n        end do\n        if (t_val == p) then\n            ans1 = ans1 + 1\n        end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Convert ans1 to a string\n   write(S, '(I0)') ans1\n   ! Now remove any trailing spaces? We use len_trim to get the length without trailing spaces.\n\n   ! Process the string S\n   removals = 0\n   top = 0\n   lenS = len_trim(S)\n\n   do i = 1, lenS\n        top = top + 1\n        stack(top) = S(i:i)\n\n        do while (top >= 2)\n            if ((stack(top) == '0' .and. stack(top-1) == '1') .or. &\n                (stack(top) == '1' .and. stack(top-1) == '0')) then\n                removals = removals + 1\n                top = top - 2\n            else\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n   end do\n\n   ! Output the result: removals * 2\n   write(*, '(I0)') removals * 2\n\n   end program\n\nBut note: the array `a` is 1-indexed? In Fortran, arrays are 1-indexed by default. However, in the Java program, the array `a` is 0-indexed. We stored the element at index x (0-indexed) in a(x+1). \n\nBut in the reading, we did:\n\n        read x, then x = x-1, then we set a(x) -> that would be a(x) in Fortran which is the element at position x (if x is 0, then a(1)? because Fortran arrays start at 1).\n\nWait, we declared:\n\n        integer, dimension(10) :: a   -> this creates an array of 10 elements: a(1), a(2), ... a(10)\n\nBut when we set a(x) and x is 0 (after subtracting 1) then we are trying to set a(0) which is out of bounds.\n\nSo we must adjust: we should store the value for the switch at index x (0-indexed) in a(x+1). \n\nTherefore, in the reading loop:\n\n        do j = 1, k\n            read(*,*) x\n            x = x - 1   ! now x is 0-indexed\n            a(x+1) = ibset(a(x+1), i)   ! because we want to store in the (x+1)-th element of the array a.\n\nSimilarly, in the subset iteration:\n\n        do bit_index = 0, N-1\n            if (btest(s_val, bit_index)) then\n                t_val = ieor(t_val, a(bit_index+1))   ! because the bit_index-th bit corresponds to the switch at index bit_index (0-indexed), which is stored in a(bit_index+1)\n            end if\n        end do\n\nAlternatively, we can index the array a from 0 to N-1? We can declare:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:9) :: a   ! for indices 0 to 9\n\nBut since we know N<=10, we can do:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:N-1) :: a   ! but we don't know N at compile time? so we can use:\n\n        integer, dimension(10) :: a   and use indices 1 to N? but then we have to adjust the reading.\n\nBut we read x, then set x=x-1, then we set a(x+1) -> that would be a(1) for x=0, which is the first element. But we have an array of size 10, and we are using indices 1..10. So that's okay.\n\nBut note: we have N elements. Our array a has 10 elements, but we only use the first N? Actually, we read N and M, then we read k and k numbers. The numbers are between 1 and N. So after subtracting 1, they are between 0 and N-1. Then we set a(x+1) for x in [0, N-1]. So we are using indices 1..N of the array a.\n\nBut in the subset iteration, we loop bit_index from 0 to N-1 and use a(bit_index+1). So that's the first N elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can declare:\n\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n        allocate(a(0:N-1))\n\nBut since N is small and known after read, we can do:\n\n        read(*,*) N, M\n        allocate(a(0:N-1))\n\nBut we don't need to allocate because N<=10. We can set the dimension to 0:9 and then use indices 0 to N-1.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's use:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:9) :: a   ! indices 0 to 9\n\n        Then in the reading:\n\n            read(*,*) x\n            x = x-1   -> so x in [0, N-1] (if the input is in [1, N])\n            a(x) = ibset(a(x), i)\n\n        Then in the subset iteration:\n\n            do bit_index = 0, N-1\n                if (btest(s_val, bit_index)) then\n                    t_val = ieor(t_val, a(bit_index))\n                end if\n            end do\n\nThis is simpler.\n\nSo we change:\n\n   integer, dimension(0:9) :: a   ! we use indices 0 to 9\n\n   a = 0   ! for all indices 0..9\n\n   Then in the reading:\n\n        do i = 0, M-1\n            read(*,*) k\n            do j = 1, k\n                read(*,*) x\n                x = x-1\n                a(x) = ibset(a(x), i)\n            end do\n        end do\n\n   And in the subset loop:\n\n        do bit_index = 0, N-1\n            if (btest(s_val, bit_index)) then\n                t_val = ieor(t_val, a(bit_index))\n            end if\n        end do\n\nBut note: the array a is defined for indices 0 to 9, but if N is 10, then we use indices 0 to 9. If N is less than 10, we only use the first N indices (0 to N-1). The rest are zero but we don't use them.\n\nSo the program becomes:\n\n   program main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: N, M, i, j, k, x, s_val, t_val, ans1, removals, top, lenS, bit_index\n   integer, dimension(0:9) :: a   ! indices 0 to 9\n   integer :: p\n   character(len=100) :: S\n   character(len=1) :: stack(100)\n   integer :: temp\n\n   !

Output the result\n   write(*, '(I0)') removals * 2\n\n   end program\n\nWe assume that the input is given exactly as for the first program (with the numbers for N, M, then the M lines of switch data, then the M integers for p).\n\nLet me test with a small example.\n\nExample from ABC128_C:\n\n   Input: \n        2 2\n        2 1 2\n        1 2\n        0 1\n\n   This means:\n        N=2, M=2\n        First switch: k=2, switches 1 and 2 -> so for bulb0 (i=0): set a[0] and a[1] with bit0.\n        Second switch: k=1, switch 2 -> for bulb1 (i=1): set a[1] with bit1.\n        Then p: [0, 1] -> so p = (0 for bit0, 1 for bit1) -> p = 2 (binary 10).\n\n   Then we iterate over s_val from 0 to 3 (00, 01, 10, 11):\n\n        s_val=0: t_val = 0 -> not equal to 2.\n        s_val=1: t_val = a[0] = 1 (binary 01) -> not 2.\n        s_val=2: t_val = a[1] = 3 (binary 11) -> not 2.\n        s_val=3: t_val = a[0] XOR a[1] = 1 XOR 3 = 2 -> equals 2. So count=1.\n\n   So ans1=1.\n\n   Then we convert 1 to string -> \"1\"\n\n   Then process \"1\": \n        i=1: push '1' -> stack: ['1'] -> top=1 -> no removal.\n        removals=0 -> output 0.\n\n   But the expected output for the entire sequence? The first program outputs 1, then the second program outputs 0.\n\n   So the final output is 0.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have intended a different chain? \n\n   However, we are following the problem: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n   So the Fortran program should output 0 for this input.\n\n   Another example: if ans1 were 10, then the string is \"10\". \n        Push '1': top=1, stack=[1]\n        Push '0': top=2, stack=[1,0]\n        Then check: top=2: stack(2)='0', stack(1)='1' -> removable. So removals=1, then top=0.\n        Then output 1*2 = 2.\n\n   So the program outputs 2.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   We'll write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We assume that the stack array is large enough (100 elements) because the string representation of ans1 has at most 4 digits (since N<=10 -> 2^10=1024 -> 4 digits).\n\n   We'll write the code."
