However, note: in the first part, we are reading the token with list-directed read. What if the input token has a space in the middle?

  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n The first Java program (atcoder_ABC043_B) processes a string:\n   - It reads a string.\n   - It processes the string character by character:\n        If the character is '0' or '1', it appends it to a StringBuilder.\n        If the character is 'B', it deletes the last character (if any).\n   - Then it prints the resulting string.\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_ABC172_D) reads an integer `n` and computes:\n        ans = sum_{i=1}^{n} [ i * (floor(n/i) * (floor(n/i)+1) ) / 2 ]\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is a string and the second program reads an integer.\n But the problem states that the output of the first program is the input to the next.\n\n How do we connect them?\n   The first program outputs a string (which is a sequence of digits). The second program expects an integer.\n\n Therefore, we must interpret the output of the first program as an integer for the second program.\n\n Steps in the combined Fortran program:\n   1. Read the initial string (which is the input for the first program).\n   2. Process the string as in the first Java program (simulate the StringBuilder with deletions).\n   3. Convert the resulting string to an integer (if the string is empty, we treat it as 0? But note the second program expects a positive integer? However, the problem says same behavior. The first program might output an empty string. The second program would then read an empty string? Actually, the second program uses `nextInt` which would fail on empty string. But in the problem, the input to the first program is a string of '0','1','B' and the output is a string of digits. So we can safely convert to integer? But what if the string is empty? The second program would throw an exception. However, in the problem context, the input string is such that the output of the first program is a nonnegative integer in string form? We have to handle the empty string.\n\n However, note the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". In the original chain, the first program writes a string and the second program reads an integer. How is that connected? In practice, we would run:\n\n   $ java atcoder_ABC043_B < input.txt > temp.txt\n   $ java atcoder_ABC172_D < temp.txt\n\n But the second program uses `nextInt` which expects an integer in the input. So the output of the first program must be a string that can be parsed as an integer. If the first program outputs an empty string, then the second program would throw an exception. We must mimic that.\n\n However, in Fortran, if we try to read an empty string as an integer, we get an error. But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must produce an error in that case? But note the problem does not specify error handling. Alternatively, we can assume the input to the first program is such that the output is a non-empty string of digits? The problem does not specify.\n\n But looking at the first program: the input string consists of '0','1','B'. The output is built by appending '0' or '1' or deleting the last character. The output string is then a string of digits (if non-empty). However, if the string is empty, we cannot convert to integer.\n\n How did the original Java program handle output? The first program outputs the string and then a newline. The second program reads an integer. If the string is empty, the output is just a newline. The second program's `nextInt` would fail.\n\n We are going to do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the entire input line (as the first program reads a string with `in.string()` which is a token, so without spaces? Actually, the LightScanner uses `StringTokenizer` and `nextToken`. But the input for the first program is a single token? The problem says the input is a string.\n\n   We'll read the input string from standard input (one line, and take the first token? But the problem does not specify multiple tokens. The original first program uses `in.string()` which reads one token. So we assume the input is one token.\n\n   Step 2: Process the token to get a string of digits (or empty).\n\n   Step 3: Convert that string to an integer. If the string is empty, we set the integer to 0? But that would not match the original if the second program fails. However, in the original chain, the second program would crash. We cannot crash in Fortran? We can try to mimic by setting the integer to 0 and then the second program would compute with n=0? But that is not the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can check: if the string is empty, then we set n=0? But the second program in Java would throw an exception. The problem does not specify error handling. So we must assume that the input to the first program is such that the output string is a valid integer? The problem says \"same behavior on the same input\".\n\n   Therefore, we assume that the input to the first program is a string that after processing will be a non-empty string of digits? Or we must handle the empty string appropriately.\n\n   The second program expects an integer. In the original chain, if the first program outputs an empty string, then the second program would read an empty token and throw an exception. In Fortran, when reading from a string that is empty, we get an error. We can avoid this by:\n\n        If the string from step 2 is empty, then we set n = 0.\n        Else, we convert the string to integer.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java uses `nextInt` which would throw an exception on empty input. However, in our Fortran program, we are reading from a string that we built. We can do:\n\n        read the string as an integer, but if the string is empty, we set n=0? But that would be different.\n\n   How about: if the string is empty, then we output 0? Because the second program would crash and produce no output? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". We are not required to handle errors? We are to produce the same output.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify error handling and the examples are likely to be valid, we will assume that the output string from the first program is non-empty? Or we can note that the second program in the given example (atcoder_ABC172_D) does not have any input that would cause an empty string? We don't know.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"same behavior\". So we must handle the empty string as the original chain would. But the original chain would crash. In Fortran, if we try to read from an empty string, we get an error and the program stops. That is similar to the Java exception? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the input leads to an empty string in the first program, then the combined program should crash? We cannot avoid that? We can let the conversion to integer fail.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n        We'll convert the string to an integer by reading from the string. If the string is empty, then we set n=0? But that is not what the second Java program does. The second Java program would throw an InputMismatchException.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid reading an empty string by checking: if the string is empty, then we set n=0 and proceed? But the second program in Java would not proceed. So we must crash? But Fortran doesn't have exceptions. We can write an error message and stop? But the original Java program writes a stack trace. We are not required to mimic the stack trace. We are required to have the same output.\n\n   The problem says: \"behaves identically\" meaning same output for same input? And if the chain crashes, then we crash? But the problem does not specify how to handle errors.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we assume that the input is such that the output of the first program is a valid integer string (non-empty). We note that the sample inputs for the first program are strings of '0','1','B' and the output is a string of digits (which might be empty). But the second program expects a positive integer? Actually, the second program works for n>=0? The formula works for n=0.\n\n   So let's do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input string (as a whole line? but the first program uses `nextToken` so we read one token). We'll read one token from the input.\n\n        Step 2: Process the token to get a string (call it `s_result`).\n\n        Step 3: If `s_result` is empty, set `n = 0`.\n                 Else, convert `s_result` to an integer `n`.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the second program with that `n`.\n\n   This will work for n=0? The second program: \n        for i from 1 to n (if n=0, the loop runs from 1 to 0? which does nothing) -> ans=0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n   However, what if the first program outputs \"0\" (a string with one zero)? Then we set n=0? That is the same as the empty string? But the empty string is not the same as \"0\". \n\n   How do we convert the string to an integer? We must convert the string of digits to an integer. The empty string is not a valid integer. But if we set empty string to 0, then both empty and \"0\" become 0. That is not the same as the original chain: the original chain would have the second program read the string \"0\" and set n=0, but if the string is empty, the second program would crash.\n\n   Therefore, we must mimic the crash? Or the problem expects that the input does not lead to an empty string? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we will do:\n\n        We are going to read the entire line for the first program? Actually, the first program reads a token. So we can read a token (the first word) from the input.\n\n        Then process that token to get a string `s_result`.\n\n        Then we try to convert `s_result` to an integer. If `s_result` is empty, we cannot convert. In Fortran, we can use internal read. We can check the length of the string: if it is 0, then we set n=0? But that is not the same. Alternatively, we can use an error condition.\n\n   However, note the second program in the chain: it uses `nextInt` which would skip any whitespace and then try to read an integer. If the input is empty, it would throw an exception. We are not required to do I/O in the intermediate step. We are allowed to do the conversion in code.\n\n   We are going to assume that the output of the first program is a non-empty string of digits? Because the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". And the second program expects an integer. The problem does not specify that the chain must handle invalid data.\n\n   Therefore, we will design for the valid case: the first program produces a non-empty string of digits. If it produces an empty string, we set n=0? Or we can note that the problem context (AtCoder problems) typically have valid inputs.\n\n   Let me check the first problem: ABC043_B. The sample inputs:\n\n        Input: 01B0 -> Output: 00\n        Input: 0BB -> Output: (empty)\n\n   So the empty string is possible.\n\n   How did the second program handle the empty string? It would crash. But in the problem, we are to combine the two. We must decide.\n\n   Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must crash on empty string. But Fortran does not throw exceptions. We can stop the program with an error message? But the original Java program throws an exception with a stack trace. We don't have to mimic the stack trace, but we must not produce an output? And return a non-zero exit code? The problem does not specify.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So if the chain crashes, we don't produce output? That is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\". So if the original chain crashes, we crash. If it produces output, we produce the same output.\n\n   How to crash in Fortran? We can try to read the empty string as an integer and that will cause a runtime error? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        integer :: n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s_result\n        ... process the input string to get s_result ...\n\n        if (len(s_result) == 0) then\n            ! This would cause the next read to fail? But we are not reading from file, we are converting a string.\n            ! We can use an internal read.\n            read(s_result, *) n   ! This will fail on empty string? Let's check: Fortran standard says that an empty string for integer read is an error.\n\n        else\n            read(s_result, *) n\n        endif\n\n   But the read of an empty string in Fortran is an error. The program will crash.\n\n   So we can rely on that? Then we don't need to check. We just do:\n\n        read(s_result, *) n\n\n   and if s_result is empty, the program crashes.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        Step 1: Read a token (the first word) from standard input. (We assume the input has at least one token? The first program uses `nextToken` which throws if there is no token? Actually, it waits for input. We are reading from stdin, so we assume there is one line.)\n\n        Step 2: Process the token as in the first Java program.\n\n        Step 3: Convert the resulting string to an integer by internal read. If the string is empty, the read fails and the program crashes.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the second program with that integer.\n\n   This matches the behavior: crashes when the string is empty, otherwise proceeds.\n\n   Now, the Fortran code:\n\n        We'll read the first token from standard input (using list-directed read? or read the whole line and then take the first word?).\n\n        Since the first program uses `nextToken`, we can read the first word.\n\n        We can read the entire line and then split? But Fortran doesn't have a tokenizer. We can read the first word.\n\n        We do:\n\n            character(1000) :: line  ! assuming the input is not longer than 1000\n            read(*, '(a)') line\n            ! Now, we want the first token: we can trim and then take until space?\n            ! But the original tokenizer by Java uses any whitespace. We can do:\n\n            ! Find the first non-blank, then from there until the next blank.\n\n            But note: the first program reads only one token. The rest of the line is ignored.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read the first token by:\n\n            character(1000) :: token\n            read(*, *) token   ! list-directed read: reads one token\n\n        This will read the first token and ignore the rest of the line? Yes.\n\n        But what if the input line is empty? Then the read will wait? Or fail? We assume there is at least one token? The first program in Java waits until non-empty? Actually, `nextToken` throws if there is no token? But the problem input is provided.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            character(1000) :: token\n            read(*, *) token\n\n   Then process the token: traverse each character.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Initialize an empty string (or a character array that we build) for the result of the first program.\n\n        We traverse each character in `token`:\n\n            if the character is '0' -> append '0'\n            if the character is '1' -> append '1'\n            if the character is 'B' -> remove the last character (if the string is non-empty)\n\n        We have to manage the string: we can use a character array and an integer for the current length.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            character(1000) :: temp = ''   ! initialize to empty\n            integer :: len_temp = 0\n\n        For each character in `token` (from 1 to len_trim(token)):\n\n            if token(i:i) == '0' then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                temp(len_temp:len_temp) = '0'\n            else if token(i:i) == '1' then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                temp(len_temp:len_temp) = '1'\n            else if token(i:i) == 'B' then\n                if (len_temp > 0) then\n                    len_temp = len_temp - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n\n        Then the result string is temp(1:len_temp)\n\n        Then we convert this substring to an integer:\n\n            character(len_temp) :: num_str\n            num_str = temp(1:len_temp)\n\n            integer :: n\n            read(num_str, *) n   ! if len_temp==0, then num_str is unallocated? We cannot have a zero-length character variable in this way.\n\n        How to handle if len_temp==0?\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if (len_temp == 0) then\n                ! We set a dummy string? But we want the read to fail? Or we can avoid and set n=0? But we want to crash on empty? \n                ! We can try to read from a zero-length string? That is not allowed.\n\n            Instead, we can use:\n\n                if (len_temp == 0) then\n                    ! We cannot read an integer from an empty string -> crash by reading from a zero-length string?\n                    ! We can use an internal file of length 0.\n                    character(0) :: dummy\n                    read(dummy, *) n   ! This will crash.\n                else\n                    read(temp(1:len_temp), *) n\n                end if\n\n        But we can also rely on the read of temp(1:len_temp) when len_temp=0: that is reading from a substring of length 0? That will crash.\n\n        So we can simply:\n\n            read(temp(1:len_temp), *) n\n\n        Then if len_temp==0, it crashes.\n\n   Now, the second part: compute\n\n        ans = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            term = i * (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) / 2\n            ans = ans + term\n        end do\n\n        But note: in the Java program, the multiplications are done in long. We must use integer with large range? The problem says n up to 10^6? Then the product might be as large as about 10^12? So we need at least 64-bit integers.\n\n        We'll use integer(kind=8) for n, i, term, ans, and the divisions.\n\n   Steps for the second program:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, i, ans, t1, t2\n\n        ans = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            t1 = n / i   ! integer division\n            t2 = t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n            ans = ans + i * t2\n        end do\n\n        But note: the expression in Java: i * (n/i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n\n        We can factor: t1 = n / i (integer division) and then term = i * ( t1 * (t1+1) ) / 2\n\n        However, note the division by 2: integer division? But the expression in Java: \n\n            (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2\n\n        The division by 2 is integer division? But note: the product is even? Because we have two consecutive integers: t1 and t1+1, so one is even. So it is exact? But integer division truncates? Actually, the expression in Java is integer arithmetic? But note: the numbers are cast to long, so it is integer arithmetic. So we do the same.\n\n        But the multiplication order: \n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        However, the multiplications might cause overflow? We are using 64-bit integers. The maximum value of t1 is n (when i=1) so t1 <= n (<= 10^6). Then t1*(t1+1) is about 10^12, then multiplied by i (which is <=10^6) gives 10^18 which is beyond 64-bit? 2^64 is about 1.8e19, so 10^18 is acceptable? But n is up to 10^6, then i is 10^6 and t1 is about 10^6? Then t1*(t1+1) is about 10^12, then multiplied by i=10^6 -> 10^18 which is 1e18, and 2^60 is about 1e18? Actually, 2^64 is 1.8446744e19. So 1e18 is safe? But 10^6 * (10^6 * (10^6+1)) = 10^6 * (10^12 + 10^6) = 10^18 + 10^12, which is about 1e18, which is less than 2^63-1 (about 9e18). So it is safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can rearrange:\n\n            term = i * ( t1 * (t1+1) / 2 )\n\n        But note: t1*(t1+1) is even, so the division by 2 is exact. And then multiplied by i: the entire expression is an integer.\n\n        However, we must be cautious about the order to avoid overflow? \n\n            Option 1: (i * t1 * (t1+1)) / 2   -> might be too big? because we multiply by i first? \n\n            Option 2: (t1 * (t1+1) / 2) * i   -> this might be better? because t1*(t1+1) is about 10^12, then divide by 2 -> 5e11, then multiplied by i (max 1e6) -> 5e17, which is safe.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            t1 = n / i\n            term = (t1 * (t1+1)) / 2   ! exact division\n            term = term * i\n            ans = ans + term\n\n        But note: the original expression: i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2 -> same as (i * t1 * (t1+1)) / 2, but if we do (t1*(t1+1))/2 * i, it is the same.\n\n        However, the original expression is:\n\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n        This is: i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        We can do:\n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        But the multiplication of three numbers might cause overflow? But we are using 64-bit integers and the maximum product is about 10^18 which is acceptable? Actually, 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^18, which is the maximum? But t1 is at most n (10^6) so the product i * t1 * (t1+1) is at most 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^18, which is 1e18, and 1e18 is 1000000000000000000, which is less than 2^63-1 (9223372036854775807). So we can do:\n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        But we must do the division by 2 as integer division? and the multiplication order? We can do:\n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        This is computed as: (i * t1 * (t1+1)) / 2. Since the entire expression is an integer, and the intermediate value might be even? Actually, the entire expression is even? Because of the consecutive integers? But we are multiplying by i and then by two consecutive integers? The consecutive integers make the product even? Then divided by 2 is exact. But the entire expression might be even? Actually, the consecutive integers ensure that one of them is even, so the product t1*(t1+1) is even. Then multiplied by i: then the entire product is even? Not necessarily: if i is odd? But then the entire product is even? Because we have at least one factor of 2 from the consecutive integers. So the division by 2 is exact.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        But note: the order of operations: multiplication and division from left to right? In Fortran, it is left to right? Actually, same as Java: same precedence and left associative.\n\n        However, we can use parentheses to make sure: \n\n            term = (i * t1 * (t1+1)) / 2\n\n        But the intermediate value might be too big? We are using 64-bit integers and the maximum is 1e18 which is acceptable? \n\n        But let me check: 10^6 * (10^6) * (10^6+1) = 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^18? Actually, 10^6 * 10^6 * (10^6+1) = 10^12 * (10^6+1) = 10^18 + 10^12, which is 1000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 = 1000001000000000000, which is about 1e18, which is less than 2^63-1 (9e18) so it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            term = i * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n\n        But note: in Fortran, integer division truncates? And the expression is positive? So it is the same as Java.\n\n   Finally, we output the ans.\n\n   Summary of the Fortran program:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! For the first part\n        character(1000) :: token, temp_str\n        integer :: i, len_token, len_temp\n        ! For the second part\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, ans, t1, j\n\n        ! Read the first token from standard input\n        read(*, *) token\n\n        ! Process the token\n        len_token = len_trim(token)   ! but note: the token might have trailing spaces? but we read with list-directed, so it doesn't have trailing spaces? Actually, list-directed trims.\n        len_temp = 0\n        temp_str = ''   ! initialize to blanks\n\n        do i = 1, len_token\n            if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '0'\n            else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '1'\n            else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                if (len_temp > 0) then\n                    len_temp = len_temp - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, convert the substring temp_str(1:len_temp) to integer n\n        if (len_temp == 0) then\n            ! We try to read from an empty string: we use an internal file of length 0 -> this will cause an error.\n            read('', *) n\n        else\n            read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n\n        end if\n\n        ! Now the second part: compute the sum\n        ans = 0\n        do j = 1, n\n            t1 = n / j   ! integer division (64-bit integers)\n            ans = ans + j * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n        end do\n\n        ! Output the answer\n        print *, ans\n\n        end program combined\n\n   However, we can avoid the crash for empty string by relying on the read of a substring of length zero? \n\n        read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n   ! if len_temp=0, then the substring is from 1 to 0? That is an empty string? In Fortran, that is allowed? \n\n   But the standard says: if the substring has length zero, then the read of an integer from an empty string is an error.\n\n   So we can remove the if:\n\n        read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n   ! if len_temp==0, it crashes.\n\n   But note: the substring temp_str(1:len_temp) when len_temp=0: in Fortran, this is an empty substring. The read of an integer from an empty string is an error.\n\n   So we can write without the if.\n\n   Also, we can avoid the initialization of temp_str to blanks? Because we are only writing to positions 1:len_temp and then reading from 1:len_temp. The rest doesn't matter.\n\n   But note: if the string is long, we are only reading the first len_temp characters.\n\n   We can also use a character variable for the internal read that is exactly the length we need? But we don't need to.\n\n   Let me write the code without the if.\n\n   Also, note: we are reading the entire token? But the token might be longer than 1000? The problem doesn't specify. We assume 1000 is enough? Or we can use a larger number? The problem says the input string for the first program is up to 10 characters? Actually, from the problem context? But we don't know. We'll use 1000.\n\n   We can also use:\n\n        character(:), allocatable :: token, temp_str\n\n   But that is more complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then take the first token? But we did read the first token.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        character(10000) :: token   ! 10000 to be safe\n\n   But the problem says the input is a string of '0','1','B' and the length is at most 10? Actually, the first problem (ABC043_B) says: |s|<=10? But in the sample, it is 4. So 1000 is enough.\n\n   Now, the complete code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        character(1000) :: token, temp_str\n        integer :: i, len_token, len_temp\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, ans, t1, j\n\n        ! Read the first token\n        read(*, *) token\n\n        ! Get the actual length of the token (without trailing spaces) from the read? \n        ! The list-directed read will put the token without trailing spaces? Actually, it reads a token and stores it without trailing spaces? But the variable token is 1000 characters, so we have to trim to get the actual token? \n        ! How long is the token? We can use len_trim(token) to get the length of the token that was read? Because the read will store the token and then pad with blanks? \n\n        len_token = len_trim(token)   ! This will give the non-blank part? But the token is read without trailing spaces? Actually, the read stores the token and then pads the rest with blanks. So len_trim will give the length.\n\n        len_temp = 0\n        temp_str = ''   ! set to blanks\n\n        do i = 1, len_token\n            if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                if (len_temp > 1000) then\n                    ! We don't expect this, but to be safe?\n                    stop 'buffer overflow'\n                end if\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '0'\n            else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                if (len_temp > 1000) then\n                    stop 'buffer overflow'\n                end if\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '1'\n            else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                if (len_temp > 0) then\n                    len_temp = len_temp - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Now convert the string in temp_str(1:len_temp) to integer n\n        if (len_temp > 0) then\n            read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n\n        else\n            ! We have an empty string: we create a zero-length string for the read to cause an error.\n            read('', *) n\n        end if\n\n        ! Alternatively, we can do without the if by:\n        !   read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n   ! which will crash on len_temp=0.\n        ! But I use the if to avoid a substring of length zero? Actually, in Fortran, a substring of length zero is allowed? \n\n        ! But note: the standard says that an internal file must not be zero-length? Actually, it is allowed but the read must have at least one value? \n\n        ! We'll try without the if? But to be safe, we use the if? Or we can just do:\n\n        !   if (len_temp == 0) then\n        !       n = 0   ! but that would change behavior? We want to crash.\n        !   else\n        !       read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n\n        !   end if\n\n        ! But the problem says: same behavior. So we want to crash. So we do the read of an empty string.\n\n        ! Actually, the above if-else does: if len_temp>0 then read, else read from empty string -> crash.\n\n        ! Now the second part\n        ans = 0\n        do j = 1, n\n            t1 = n / j\n            ans = ans + j * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n        end do\n\n        print *, ans\n\n        end program combined\n\n   But note: the division by 2: we are using integer division? And the expression is integer. But the consecutive integers t1 and t1+1: their product is even, so the division by 2 is exact? So we are safe.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n            ans = ans + j * (t1 * (t1+1) / 2)\n\n   to avoid the large product? But the product j * (t1*(t1+1)) might be larger? Actually, we are doing the same: \n\n        j * t1 * (t1+1) / 2   = j * (t1*(t1+1)/2)\n\n   But the latter avoids the intermediate product j * t1 * (t1+1) which might be larger? But we are in 64-bit and the maximum is 1e18 which is acceptable? \n\n   We'll do as above.\n\n   Let me test with n=1: \n        j=1: t1 = 1/1 = 1, term = 1 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 1 -> ans=1.\n\n        The second program: for n=1, the formula: i=1: 1 * (1) * (1+1)/2 = 1*1*2/2=1.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   But note: in the second program, the variable `n` is integer(kind=8) and j is integer(kind=8). The division t1 = n/j is integer division? Yes.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! We'll use a large buffer for the token and the temporary string.\n        character(1000) :: token, temp_str\n        integer :: i, len_token, len_temp\n        integer(kind=8) :: n, ans, t1, j\n\n        ! Read the first token from stdin\n        read(*, *) token\n        len_token = len_trim(token)\n\n        ! Initialize the temporary string and its length\n        len_temp = 0\n        temp_str = ''   ! fill with blanks\n\n        ! Process each character in the token\n        do i = 1, len_token\n            if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                if (len_temp > 1000) then\n                    stop 'Buffer overflow in temp_str'\n                end if\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '0'\n            else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                len_temp = len_temp + 1\n                if (len_temp > 1000) then\n                    stop 'Buffer overflow in temp_str'\n                end if\n                temp_str(len_temp:len_temp) = '1'\n            else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                if (len_temp > 0) then\n                    len_temp = len_temp - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Convert the processed string to integer n\n        if (len_temp == 0) then\n            ! This causes an error to mimic the Java chain\n            read('', *) n\n        else\n            read(temp_str(1:len_temp), *) n\n        end if\n\n        ! Compute the answer for the second part\n        ans = 0\n        do j = 1, n\n            t1 = n / j\n            ans = ans + j * t1 * (t1+1) / 2\n        end do\n\n        ! Output the answer\n        print *, ans\n\n        end program combined\n\n   But note: the second part uses a loop from 1 to n. If n is large (like 10^6) then the loop runs 10^6 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize the second part? But the problem does not require optimization. The original Java program does a loop from 1 to n.\n\n   We'll leave it as is.\n\n   But note: the original second program uses:\n\n        ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n   We are doing the same.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   However, note: in the first part, we are reading the token with list-directed read. What if the input token has a space in the middle? The first Java program uses `nextToken` so it reads only the next token (without spaces). Our Fortran read(*,*) token does the same.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me test with sample input:\n\n        Input for first program: \"01B0\" -> output \"00\"\n\n        Then the second program gets n=00 -> which is 0? Then it outputs 0.\n\n        But the first program outputs \"00\", which is two zeros. The second program reads that as 00 -> which is 0.\n\n        So for input \"01B0\", the combined program outputs 0.\n\n        But the first program outputs \"00\", then the second program: n=0 -> ans=0.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Another sample: \"0BB\" -> the first program: \n            start: empty\n            '0': becomes \"0\"\n            'B': becomes \"\"\n            'B': remains \"\"\n            so output is empty -> crash.\n\n        So we crash.\n\n   But what if we have a token that is not only '0','1','B'? The first program ignores any other character? The Java program only handles '0','1','B'. Other characters are ignored? \n\n        In the Java program: \n            switch (c) {\n                case '0': ... break;\n                case '1': ... break;\n                case 'B': ... break;\n            }\n\n        So other characters are ignored.\n\n   Therefore, we should do the same: ignore any character that is not '0','1','B'.\n\n   We'll modify the Fortran code: if the character is not one of these, we do nothing.\n\n   But the above code already does that: we have if-else if-else if, and no else. So we do nothing for other characters.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   We write the final code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the second program expects a positive integer? But we are passing 0? That is acceptable? The second program: for n=0, the loop runs from j=1 to 0? which does nothing -> ans=0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code as above."
