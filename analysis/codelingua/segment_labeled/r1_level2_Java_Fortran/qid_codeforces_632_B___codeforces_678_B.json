  "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n The first program (codeforces_632_B) does:\n   - Reads an integer `n`, then an array `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n`.\n   - Computes an initial sum `sum` by adding `a[i]` for every 'B' in `s`.\n   - Then it does two passes (forward and backward) to compute a maximum value `ans`.\n\n The second program (codeforces_678_B) does:\n   - Reads an integer `y`.\n   - Checks if `y` is a leap year (using function `check_leap`).\n   - Then it starts from `y+1` and iterates until it finds a year `i` such that:\n        - The total days from `y+1` to `i` (inclusive) modulo 7 is 0 (meaning same day of the week as the start of `y+1` would be the same as the start of `i+1`? Actually note: the problem is about the same day of the week for January 1st of the next year and the target year?).\n        - And the leap status of `i` is the same as that of `y`.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence of programs means that the output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs a single long integer (ans) and the second program reads an integer (y). So we have:\n\n   Input for the chain: the input for the first program (n, array a, string s)\n   Then the output of the first program (ans) becomes the input (y) for the second program.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We must design the Fortran program to:\n     1. Read the input for the first program (n, array a, string s).\n     2. Perform the computations of the first program to get `ans`.\n     3. Then use `ans` (which is a long integer) as the `y` for the second program. However, note that the second program expects an integer (and the first program's output is a long integer that might be within integer range? We'll use integer in Fortran for y, but note that the year in the second program is an integer).\n\n   But note: the first program's output is printed and then the second program reads from standard input. In the combined program, we avoid I/O in the middle. So:\n\n     - The first part (from program1) will compute a value `ans1` (which is the output of the first program).\n     - Then the second part (from program2) will take `ans1` as the starting year `y` and compute the next year that meets the condition.\n\n   However, we must note: the first program's output is a single integer (the answer). The second program then reads that integer and uses it as `y`.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n        Input: (for program1) -> program1 computes ans1 -> program2 uses ans1 as input and computes ans2 -> output ans2.\n\n   But note: the second program does not output the same type? It outputs a year.\n\n   So the combined program:\n\n        Reads: n, then n integers, then a string of length n.\n        Computes ans1 (as in the first program).\n        Then sets y = ans1 (converted to integer? Note: ans1 is a long in Java, but in Fortran we can use integer(kind=8) for the first part, but the second program uses an integer. However, the problem says the input for the second program is an integer. So we assume ans1 is within integer range? We'll use integer for y, but note that the first program might produce a large number? The problem says the input for the first program: n up to 500,000 and a[i] up to 10,000. Then the maximum sum might be 500000*10000 = 5e9, which is too big for 32-bit integer. So we must use 64-bit integers for the first part.\n\n        But the second program: the year? The problem says \"y\", and in the second program it's an integer. The constraints? The problem doesn't specify, but typically years are 4-digit. However, the first program's output is a large integer (up to 5e9) which is within the range of 64-bit integers, but the second program's algorithm might not be designed for such large numbers? Actually, the second program iterates until it finds a year that matches. The gap might be 6, 11, 12, etc. years? But 5e9 is huge and the iteration would be too slow.\n\n        This suggests that the chain might not be intended? Or perhaps the first program's output is not necessarily a year? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        We must stick to the specification.\n\n        However, note: the second program (codeforces_678_B) is about \"next same calendar year\". The input year is at least 2016? The example? But the first program outputs a number that might be huge (like 5e9). This would break the second program because the loop would run for a very long time.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n        So we have to do exactly that.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll use 64-bit integers for the first part (if needed) and then convert to integer for the second part? But the second part in Java uses `int y = in.nextInt();` which is 32-bit? But 5e9 is too big for 32-bit (max 2e9). So the input to the second program might be out of range? \n\n        This is a problem. However, the problem does not specify the constraints of the second program. But note: the first program might output a number that is too big for the second program's `int`. In Java, `int` is 32-bit. So if the first program outputs a number > 2e9, the second program would not work. But the problem says \"same input\", so we assume the test inputs are such that the first program's output is within [0, 2e9]? Or the second program might break? We have to do as the original.\n\n        Since the original chain would break on such input, we can break similarly? But note: the second program uses `in.nextInt()` which for a number too big would throw an exception? But the problem says we run on the same input. So we assume the input to the first program is such that the computed `ans` is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer? Or maybe the problem expects 64-bit for the second program? Actually, the second program in Java uses `int` for the year. So if `ans` is too big, the chain breaks.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          In Fortran, we can use a 64-bit integer for the first part, and then for the second part we use a 32-bit integer? But Fortran doesn't have strict 32-bit and 64-bit without kind parameters. We can use:\n\n          For the first part: \n             integer(kind=8) :: n, i, sum, ans1, sum1, ... \n          But note: the array `a` might be of size up to 500,000, so we need to use an array of 64-bit integers? Actually, the a[i] are read as integers (32-bit) in Java. But then they are added to a long (64-bit). In Fortran, we can read the array as 32-bit integers and then use 64-bit for the sums.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          integer, parameter :: long = selected_int_kind(18)   ! for 64-bit integers\n          integer, parameter :: int_k = selected_int_kind(9)   ! for 32-bit integers (or use default for integers? but the year in the second program is 32-bit?).\n\n        However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". If the first program outputs a number that is too big for the second program, then the Java chain would throw an exception (InputMismatchException for nextInt() if the number is too big). We cannot do that in Fortran. We can only read as much as the type allows.\n\n        How about we assume that the input to the first program is such that the output `ans` is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer? Then we can store the second program's `y` as a 32-bit integer. But if `ans` is too big, we cannot.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 64-bit integers for the second program? But the original second program uses `int` (32-bit). So we must use 32-bit.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we note:\n\n          The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n          We are to translate the entire sequence. So we must simulate the chain.\n\n          We will do:\n\n            Read the input for the first program (n, array, string) and compute `ans1` (with 64-bit arithmetic).\n\n            Then, if `ans1` is outside the range of a 32-bit integer, we might have an issue. But the problem does not specify, so we assume the test cases are within the range.\n\n            Then, we set `y = int(ans1, kind=4)` (if we use 4 for 32-bit). But Fortran does not have a standard way to convert and check for overflow? We can just assign and hope? Or we can use:\n\n            integer(kind=4) :: y\n\n            But note: the Fortran standard does not specify the exact bit sizes. We can use:\n\n               integer :: y   ! which might be 32-bit or 64-bit? We want 32-bit.\n\n            To be safe, we can use:\n\n               use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n               integer(kind=int32) :: y\n\n            But we don't know if the compiler supports that. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n               integer :: y\n\n            and assume that it is 32-bit? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        However, the problem says to run on the same input. So we assume the input is such that `ans1` is in the range of a typical Fortran integer (which might be 32 or 64 bits). But the second program in Java uses 32-bit. So we must use 32-bit for `y` to match the behavior.\n\n        How to handle overflow? We don't. We assume the test cases are valid.\n\n        Steps for the combined program:\n\n          Step 1: Read n (as integer). Then read n integers (array a). Then read a string s of length n.\n\n          Step 2: Compute the initial sum for 'B' (using 64-bit integers for the sum).\n\n          Step 3: Do the forward and backward passes to get the maximum ans (ans1).\n\n          Step 4: Set y = int(ans1, kind=4) [if we can specify 32-bit]. But note: Fortran has no kind=4 standard. We can use:\n\n                  use iso_fortran_env\n                  integer(kind=int32) :: y\n\n          Step 5: Then for the second program, we need to compute the next year that is \"same calendar\" as y.\n\n          Step 6: Print the result of the second program.\n\n        However, note: the second program uses a helper function `check_leap`. We'll write that as a function.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n          We must be cautious about the first program: the string s has length n, and the array a has n elements.\n\n          In the first program:\n\n            long sum = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n                char ch = s.charAt(i);\n                if (ch == 'B') sum += a[i];\n            }\n\n          Then two passes.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: total_sum, total_sum1, ans1\n            integer :: n, i\n            integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s   ! variable length\n\n          How to read the string? We read after the array. The problem says: the input is n, then n integers, then a string.\n\n          We assume the string is given without spaces? The problem doesn't specify, but the Java code uses `sc.next()`, so it is one token.\n\n          We can read the string as:\n\n             character(len=500000) :: temp   ! but n can be up to 500000, so we need a string of length n\n\n          Actually, the problem says the string has length n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n             read(*,*) n\n             allocate(a(n))\n             do i=1, n\n                 read(*,*) a(i)\n             end do\n             read(*,*) temp\n             ! But we only need the first n characters? Actually, the string has exactly n characters.\n\n          We can do:\n\n             character(len=n) :: s   ! but we don't know n at compile time.\n\n          So we can:\n\n             character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n             read(*,*) n\n             allocate(a(n))\n             do i=1, n\n                 read(*,*) a(i)\n             end do\n             allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n             read(*,'(A)') s   ! read a string of exactly n characters? Actually, the input might be without spaces and exactly n.\n\n          But the Java code uses `sc.next()` which reads a token. So we can read the next token and assume it has exactly n characters.\n\n          Alternatively, we can read the token and then check the length? The problem says the string has length n.\n\n          We'll read the token and take the first n characters? But the token might be longer? We assume the input is correct.\n\n          We can read the token as:\n\n             read(*,*) s   ! and then we set the length? But Fortran will read the entire token and we can allocate s to that length.\n\n          However, we know the length is n. So we can do:\n\n             allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n             read(*,*) s\n\n          But if the token has more than n characters, it will read n characters? Actually, no: it will read the entire token and then we take the first n? We must ensure we read exactly n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can read the entire line? But the problem says the input is: first integer n, then n integers, then a string (without spaces) of n characters.\n\n          We can do:\n\n             read the n integers: then we read the next token and if it has more than n, we take the first n? But the problem says the string has length n.\n\n          Let's do:\n\n             read the next token and then set s = the token (and then check if the length is n? if not, we take the first n). But the problem says it is n.\n\n          To be safe, we do:\n\n             read(*,*) s   ! this will read a token (without spaces) and then we can check the length\n\n          But then we can allocate a string of the actual length? But we know it should be n.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: the string s has length n.\n\n          So:\n\n             allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n             read(*,'(A)') s   ! read a string of exactly n characters? \n\n          But the input token might be padded? We can use:\n\n             read(*,*) s   ! and Fortran will read the next token and store as many characters as the variable has? And if the token is longer, it will be truncated? If shorter, it will be padded with spaces? \n\n          We don't want that. We want exactly the n characters.\n\n          We can use:\n\n             read(*,'(A)') s   ! without specifying the width? Then it will read the entire line? We don't want that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can read the token in a character variable of sufficient length (say 500000) and then take the first n.\n\n          Since n can be up to 500000, we can do:\n\n             character(len=500000) :: buffer\n             read(*,*) buffer\n             s = buffer(1:n)\n\n          But we can also allocate s to length n and then read the token and hope that the token is exactly n? The problem says so.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n             allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n             read(*,*) s\n\n          And if the token is longer than n, the rest is truncated? But the problem says the string has length n.\n\n          Step 2: Compute initial total_sum (for 'B')\n\n          Step 3: Forward pass:\n\n             total_sum1 = total_sum\n             ans1 = total_sum\n             do i=1, n\n                 if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                     total_sum1 = total_sum1 + a(i)\n                 else\n                     total_sum1 = total_sum1 - a(i)\n                 end if\n                 ans1 = max(ans1, total_sum1)\n             end do\n\n          Then backward pass:\n\n             total_sum1 = total_sum\n             do i=n, 1, -1\n                 if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                     total_sum1 = total_sum1 + a(i)\n                 else\n                     total_sum1 = total_sum1 - a(i)\n                 end if\n                 ans1 = max(ans1, total_sum1)\n             end do\n\n          Step 4: Set y = int(ans1, kind=4) but we have to be cautious. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n             integer :: y\n             y = int(ans1)   ! convert to default integer (which we hope is 32-bit)\n\n          But if the system default integer is 64-bit, then it will hold. However, the second program in Java uses 32-bit. So we must simulate 32-bit? We can do:\n\n             y = int(ans1)   ! and if ans1 is too big, it will wrap? But Fortran doesn't specify. We can use modulo arithmetic? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n             use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n             integer(kind=int32) :: y\n\n          Then:\n\n             y = int(ans1, kind=int32)\n\n          Step 5: Then we write the second program:\n\n             We have a function to check leap:\n\n                 logical function check_leap(year)\n                     integer(kind=int32), intent(in) :: year\n                     check_leap = .false.\n                     if (mod(year,400) == 0) then\n                         check_leap = .true.\n                     else if (mod(year,4)==0 .and. mod(year,100)/=0) then\n                         check_leap = .true.\n                     end if\n                 end function\n\n             Then:\n\n                 leap = check_leap(y)\n                 total_days = 0\n                 i = y+1\n                 do \n                     if (check_leap(i)) then\n                         total_days = total_days + 366\n                     else\n                         total_days = total_days + 365\n                     end if\n                     if (mod(total_days,7)==0) then\n                         if ( (check_leap(i) .and. leap) .or. (.not. check_leap(i) .and. .not. leap) ) then\n                             print *, i\n                             exit\n                         end if\n                     end if\n                     i = i+1\n                 end do\n\n          However, note: the second program uses `int` for `sum` and `mod`. But the total_days can become very large? The gap might be 6, 11, 12, ... years? But if the starting year is huge (like 5e9) then we cannot iterate until we find the next one (which might be 6 years? or 11? but actually the cycle is 28 years? but not exactly because leap years). However, the problem says to do the same as the original. The original second program iterates until it finds one. So we do the same.\n\n          But note: the second program might run forever if the gap is too large? We assume the test cases are such that the gap is small? Or the first program output is a reasonable year? \n\n          Given the chain: the first program's output is not necessarily a year? It is a large number. So the second program might not be designed for that.\n\n          But the problem says: same input. So we assume the input for the first program is such that the output `ans1` is a year in a reasonable range? \n\n          Alternatively, the problem might have intended two separate programs? But we are to chain them.\n\n        We'll write the entire Fortran program accordingly.\n\n        We note: we must avoid I/O in the middle. Only the first block reads, and the last block writes.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          program combined\n            use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n            implicit none\n\n            ! For the first program\n            integer :: n, i\n            integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n            integer(kind=8) :: total_sum, total_sum1, ans1   ! 64-bit integers for the first part\n\n            ! For the second program\n            integer(kind=int32) :: y, i_year, total_days\n            logical :: leap, check_leap\n            integer(kind=8) :: big_i   ! we might use 64-bit for i in the second program? But the second program uses int (32-bit). However, the total_days might become huge? We can use 64-bit for total_days? But the original uses int (32-bit) for total_days? \n\n          But note: the second program in Java:\n\n              int sum = 0;\n              for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                  if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                  else sum += 365;\n                  if (sum % 7 == 0) { ... }\n\n          The variable `sum` is a 32-bit integer. It might overflow if the gap is large (like 100,000 years: 100000*366 = 36.6e6, which is less than 2e9? So 32-bit might be enough? Because 2e9 is about 5e6 years? But the gap is at most 28 years? Actually, the cycle of the calendar repeats every 28 years? But not exactly? Actually, the problem finds the next year that has the same leap status and the same day of the week for January 1st. The gap is at most 28 years? I think so. So we can use 32-bit for total_days? \n\n          However, the starting year might be huge, but the gap is small (28 years). So total_days = 28 * 366 = 10248, which is safe for 32-bit.\n\n          Therefore, we can use 32-bit for the second program.\n\n          But note: the second program iterates from y+1 until the next same calendar year. The gap is at most 28 years? So we can iterate at most 28 times.\n\n          Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n (as a 32-bit integer)\n          Allocate a(n) (32-bit integers for a)\n          Read the n integers\n          Allocate s of length n and read the string\n\n          total_sum = 0\n          do i=1, n\n             if (s(i:i)=='B') total_sum = total_sum + a(i)\n          end do\n\n          ans1 = total_sum\n          total_sum1 = total_sum\n          do i=1, n\n             if (s(i:i)=='A') then\n                 total_sum1 = total_sum1 + a(i)\n             else\n                 total_sum1 = total_sum1 - a(i)\n             end if\n             ans1 = max(ans1, total_sum1)\n          end do\n\n          total_sum1 = total_sum\n          do i=n, 1, -1\n             if (s(i:i)=='A') then\n                 total_sum1 = total_sum1 + a(i)\n             else\n                 total_sum1 = total_sum1 - a(i)\n             end if\n             ans1 = max(ans1, total_sum1)\n          end do\n\n          Now set y = int(ans1, int32)\n\n          Then:\n\n          leap = check_leap(y)\n\n          total_days = 0\n          i_year = y+1\n          do\n             if (check_leap(i_year)) then\n                 total_days = total_days + 366\n             else\n                 total_days = total_days + 365\n             end if\n\n             if (mod(total_days,7) == 0) then\n                 if ( (check_leap(i_year) .and. leap) .or. (.not. check_leap(i_year) .and. .not. leap) ) then\n                     write(*,*) i_year\n                     exit\n                 end if\n             end if\n\n             i_year = i_year + 1\n          end do\n\n        We must write the function check_leap.\n\n        Let's write:\n\n          logical function check_leap(year) result(leap_result)\n            integer(kind=int32), intent(in) :: year\n            leap_result = .false.\n            if (mod(year,400)==0) then\n                leap_result = .true.\n            else if (mod(year,4)==0) then\n                if (mod(year,100)/=0) then\n                    leap_result = .true.\n                end if\n            end if\n          end function\n\n        But note: we have two variables named `leap` (a logical) and `check_leap` (a function). So we cannot have the function named `check_leap` and a variable named `leap`? That's okay.\n\n        However, we have a variable named `i` and `i_year`? We use `i_year` for the year in the loop.\n\n        We must be cautious: the first program uses `i` for the loops, and the second program uses `i` for the year? We changed to `i_year`.\n\n        We'll write the entire program.\n\n        Note: We are using `iso_fortran_env` for `int32`. Not all compilers support it? But we assume a modern Fortran compiler.\n\n        If the compiler does not support `iso_fortran_env`, we can use:\n\n            integer, parameter :: int32 = selected_int_kind(9)\n\n        But we'll use the module.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Important: The first program reads from standard input, then the second program reads the output of the first. We avoid I/O in the middle by storing the intermediate value in a variable.\n\n        We assume the input for the first program is given, and then the combined program produces the output of the second program.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            program combined\n            use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n            implicit none\n\n            !

But we are not testing, we are translating.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But note: the second program uses `int` for `sum` (which we called `total_days`). We used `integer(kind=int32) :: total_days`. This is safe because the gap is small.\n\n        We output the year (i_year) at the end.\n\n        This is the entire program.\n\n        One more note: the first program uses 0-indexed string and array? In Fortran, we use 1-indexed. So the string `s` is read and we use s(1:1) for the first character.\n\n        The array `a` is indexed from 1 to n.\n\n        This matches: the first program does:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) -> in Fortran i=1 to n.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        We write the code accordingly.\n\n        Let me write the code."
