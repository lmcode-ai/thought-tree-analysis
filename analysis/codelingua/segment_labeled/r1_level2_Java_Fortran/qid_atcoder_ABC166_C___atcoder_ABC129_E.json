Actually, the problem is: \n          We are counting the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b = a xor b, and a+b <= L (which is given as a binary string). The recurrence is known: \n          Let dp[i][0] = number of ways for the prefix such that the sum is strictly less than L's prefix, and dp[i][1] = equal so far. Then for a '0' in L at position i:\n            - If we are in the equal state, then we can only choose (0,0) -> then state remains equal? and then there's an additional part for the free choices? The recurrence in the Java code might be correct. We follow it. So in Fortran, we do:\n\n          dp(0,0) = 1\n          dp(0,1) = 0\n\n          do i = 0, nbin-1\n             if (bin_str(i+1:i+1) == '0') then\n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)   ! from the first part\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n                 ! then the second part: \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( dp(i,1)*2, M ), M)\n             else\n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)   ! from the first part\n                 ! then the second part: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + mod( dp(i,0)*2, M), M)   ! note: dp(i+1,0) was not set in the first part, so it was 0? dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( dp(i,1)*2, M), M)\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          Then the answer is mod( dp(nbin,0) + dp(nbin,1), M)\n\nBut note: in the else branch, we set dp(i+1,1) in the first part, then we add to it in the second part.

We do:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0)+dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> sets dp(i+1,1) to a value\n        then: \n            dp(i+1,0) = 0 + mod(2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)   -> sets dp(i+1,0) to that mod value\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + mod(2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> then mod again But the Java code does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M; So it is adding. So our code is correct. However, we are doing mod at every step? The Java code does mod at every assignment? In the else branch, the Java code:\n\n      dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;   // first part\n      // then:\n      dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n      dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M; So we do:\n\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0)+dp(i,1), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + mod(2 * dp(i,0), M_mod), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod(2 * dp(i,1), M_mod), M_mod) But we can also do without nested mod:\n\n      dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod) Because mod(a+b, M) = mod( mod(a,M) + mod(b,M), M) ?",

Actually, we don't need to mod the multiplication separately? We can mod the entire expression. So we change to:\n\n        if (bin_str(i+1:i+1) == '0') then\n            dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n        else\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M_mod )\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n        end if\n\nBut note: in the '0' branch, we do:\n\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBut initially, dp(i+1,1) was set to dp(i,1). So:\n\n            = mod( dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod) = mod(3 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nSimilarly, in the else branch, we set dp(i+1,1) to (dp(i,0)+dp(i,1)) mod M_mod, then add 2 * dp(i,1) mod M_mod. But we can combine the addition:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> but wait, we also set dp(i+1,0) to 2 * dp(i,0). And dp(i+1,1) is also added 2 * dp(i,1). So it is:\n\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod) = mod( dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1), M_mod) But the original Java code does two separate assignments? Actually, the Java code does:\n\n        if (s[i]=='0') {\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n        } So it is exactly what we did. But note: in the else branch, the assignment to dp[i+1][0] is adding to what was there? But in the else branch, before the second part, dp[i+1][0] is 0? So we are effectively setting it to (0 + 2 * dp[i][0]) % M. But in the '0' branch, we are setting dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1] and then adding 2 * dp[i][1]. So we are doing the same.

(2,0): same as (0,2) -> valid. (1,2): 1+2=3, 1 XOR 2=3 -> 3? actually 1 XOR 2 = 3? In binary: 01 XOR 10 = 11 -> 3? and 1+2=3 -> equal? -> valid. But 3<=2? no, so invalid. (2,1): same -> invalid.

The output of the first program is the input to the second program.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC166_C):\n- Reads two integers: N and M (where M is a long, but in Fortran we can use integer for both).\n- Then reads an array H of N long integers.\n- Then processes M pairs of integers (edges in a graph).

Actually, the code does two separate parts]\n- Actually, the Java code does two parts for each character.\n\nBut note: The second program reads from standard input. However, in the sequence, the input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\nFirst program outputs an integer (the count). So the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s? \n\nWait: This is a problem. The first program outputs an integer, but the second program expects a string of binary digits (characters '0' and '1'). \n\nWe must adjust: The entire chain must work on the same data flow. \n\nBut the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input to the second program. However, the second program expects a string of binary digits. This is inconsistent.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem: \nThe instruction says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nBut the two programs are independent and the output of the first is the input to the second. However, the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s, but the first program outputs a single integer. \n\nThis implies that the integer from the first program must be converted to a binary string (as a sequence of 0s and 1s) to be the input of the second program? \n\nBut the problem does not specify such conversion. We must be cautious.\n\nLooking at the second program: it is solving a problem that is independent of the first? Actually, the two programs are from different contests (ABC166 and ABC129). \n\nThis suggests that the two programs are not naturally connected. However, the problem states that they are executed in sequence.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nTherefore, we must design the Fortran program so that:\n1. The first part (corresponding to the first Java program) reads the input (N, M, and the array H and the M pairs) and computes the integer result (ans2).\n2. Then, that integer result (ans2) is passed as input to the second program? But the second program expects a string. \n\nWait, the second program reads a string. How is the integer from the first program going to be used as a string? \n\nActually, the second program in the example reads a string that represents a binary number. The integer from the first program must be converted to its binary representation? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the conversion. However, note that the first program outputs an integer and the second program expects a string. So the natural way is to convert the integer to a string of decimal digits? Or to a binary string? \n\nBut the second program's example input is a string of 0s and 1s. For instance, if the first program outputs the integer 5, then the second program expects the string \"101\" or the string \"5\"?\n\nLooking at the second program: it is for the problem \"ABC129 E\" which is \"Sum Equals Xor\". The problem typically takes a binary string L (which can be very long). \n\nTherefore, the output of the first program (an integer) is not in the form that the second program expects. \n\nThis indicates that the two programs are not meant to be connected by the integer value but by the entire output? Or perhaps the problem is misstated.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the confusion, let's assume that the first program's output (an integer) is written as a string of decimal digits? But the second program expects a binary string (with characters '0' and '1'). \n\nAlternatively, we might interpret that the integer from the first program is to be converted into a binary string (without any extra characters) and that binary string is the input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program's problem statement (ABC129 E) says: \n\"Given a string L representing a binary number, ...\"\n\nSo the input to the second program is a string of 0s and 1s. Therefore, we must convert the integer (ans2) from the first program into a binary string (without any prefix, just the binary digits).\n\nHowever, note: the integer from the first program can be zero. The binary representation of zero is \"0\".\n\nBut the second program's DP algorithm must be able to handle that.\n\nBut wait: the problem does not specify the conversion. We are to reproduce the same behavior. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N, M, array H, and M pairs).\n2. Compute the integer result (let's call it `count`).\n3. Convert `count` to a binary string (without any extra spaces, just the binary digits). However, note that the second program expects a string of arbitrary length? But the integer `count` is at most N (which is at most 10^5) so the binary representation will be about 17 digits? \n\nBut the second program is designed for a string that can be up to 100000 digits? Actually, in the problem ABC129 E, the string L can be up to 100000 digits. But our `count` is at most 10^5, so the binary representation has about 17 digits. So the second program will run on a very short string.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to chain two independent programs, but the output of the first is a decimal string? and the second expects a binary string? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire chain is:\n\nInput for the first program -> first program runs -> produces an integer -> that integer is then used as the input to the second program, meaning the second program reads that integer as a decimal string? But the second program expects a binary string.\n\nThis is a fundamental mismatch.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I must assume that the problem expects the integer from the first program to be converted to a binary string (with no leading zeros? or including leading zeros? Actually, we just convert the number to base-2 and then use that string).\n\nBut note: the second program's example input might be \"1\" (which is binary for 1) or \"10\" (binary for 2). \n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N, M, H, and the M pairs).\n2. Compute the integer `count` (the number of good observation towers).\n3. Convert `count` to a binary string. For example, if `count` is 5, then the binary string is \"101\".\n4. Then, use that binary string as the input to the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program uses modulo 1000000007. And the DP is set for the entire string.\n\nHowever, the second program in the example is designed for a string that is a binary number (like the binary representation of a very big number). But our `count` is an integer, so we can convert it to a binary string.\n\nBut the second program does not require the binary string to be of any particular length? It works for any string of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nStep 1: Run the logic of the first program to get `count`.\nStep 2: Convert `count` to a binary string (without any prefix, and without leading zeros, except that zero should be represented as \"0\").\nStep 3: Then run the second program on this binary string.\n\nBut note: the second program expects a line of input. So we will pass the binary string as that line.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo the entire Fortran program should:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (N, M, array H, and M pairs) from standard input.\n- Then, without any I/O, process the first program's logic to get `count`.\n- Then, without I/O, convert `count` to a binary string (stored in a character variable).\n- Then, without I/O, run the second program's logic (the DP) on that binary string.\n- Then, output the result of the second program (an integer modulo 1000000007).\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program structure:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program.\n2. Process the first program (without any output to the screen, just store the result as an integer `count`).\n3. Convert `count` to a binary string (without I/O, just internal conversion).\n4. Process the second program using that binary string (without reading again from standard input).\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nNow, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nNote: The conversion of an integer to a binary string in Fortran:\n\nWe can write a function to do that. But note: the integer `count` can be zero.\n\nSteps for conversion:\n  - If count is 0, then the string is \"0\".\n  - Otherwise, we repeatedly divide by 2 and get the remainders (0 or 1) and build the string in reverse.\n\nBut note: the binary string should not have leading zeros? Actually, we want the standard binary representation without leading zeros (except for zero itself).\n\nWe'll allocate a character string of sufficient length (say 64 characters for a 64-bit integer, but `count` is at most 10^5, so 17 digits is enough). We can use 20 characters.\n\nWe'll write a subroutine or do it inline.\n\nAlternatively, we can use internal write? But we are to avoid I/O. However, internal file is acceptable as it is in-memory.\n\nExample:\n\n  character(len=20) :: bin_str\n  integer :: count_val, temp, i, j\n  ! ... \n  if (count_val == 0) then\n      bin_str = \"0\"\n  else\n      ! We'll build the string backwards\n      temp = count_val\n      i = 1\n      do while (temp > 0)\n          bin_str(i:i) = char(48 + mod(temp, 2))   ! 48 is '0', 49 is '1'\n          temp = temp / 2\n          i = i + 1\n      end do\n      ! Now we have the string in reverse. We need to reverse it.\n      ! But note: we built from the least significant bit to the most.\n      ! We can then reverse the substring of length i-1.\n      ! Alternatively, we can build from the end to the beginning.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n  character(len=20) :: buffer\n  integer :: k, len_bin\n  write(buffer, '(B20)') count_val   ! This writes in binary, but with leading spaces and without the '0b' prefix?\n  But the B20 format will write as a binary number, but it will be right-justified and padded with spaces. Then we can trim and remove leading spaces? But then we might get a string of 20 characters including leading zeros? We don't want leading zeros.\n\n  Actually, we want the minimal representation.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  write(buffer, '(B0)') count_val   ! B0 means use the minimal number of digits? But B0 is not standard? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n  write(buffer, *) count_val   -> but this writes in decimal.\n\n  So we write our own.\n\nPlan:\n\n  character(len=50) :: bin_str\n  integer :: nbin, count_val, temp, i\n  integer, parameter :: max_len = 50\n\n  bin_str = ''\n  if (count_val == 0) then\n      bin_str = \"0\"\n      nbin = 1\n  else\n      temp = count_val\n      nbin = 0\n      do while (temp > 0)\n          nbin = nbin + 1\n          if (mod(temp,2) == 0) then\n              bin_str(nbin:nbin) = '0'\n          else\n              bin_str(nbin:nbin) = '1'\n          end if\n          temp = temp / 2\n      end do\n      ! Now reverse the string of length nbin\n      do i = 1, nbin/2\n          ! swap bin_str(i) and bin_str(nbin-i+1)\n          j = nbin - i + 1\n          c = bin_str(i:i)\n          bin_str(i:i) = bin_str(j:j)\n          bin_str(j:j) = c\n      end do\n  end if\n\nBut note: we don't know the exact length of the binary string. We allocated 50, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid reversing by building the string from the end to the beginning? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      temp = count_val\n      nbin = 0\n      i = max_len\n      do while (temp > 0)\n          if (mod(temp,2) == 0) then\n              bin_str(i:i) = '0'\n          else\n              bin_str(i:i) = '1'\n          end if\n          temp = temp / 2\n          i = i - 1\n          nbin = nbin + 1\n      end do\n      ! Then the binary string is from i+1 to max_len? But we want to shift it to the beginning? Or we can use the substring bin_str(i+1:max_len) as the string? But then we have to store it in a variable of exact length? \n\n  Alternatively, we can then shift the substring to the left? \n\n  But for simplicity, we can do the reversal.\n\nNow, the second program:\n\n  We have the binary string in a variable, say `bin_str` of length `nbin`? Actually, we have the entire string of 50 characters? But we know the actual binary string is of length `nbin` and stored in the first `nbin` characters? Actually, no: in the reversal method we built the string in the first `nbin` characters and then reversed them. \n\n  Actually, in the first method (without shifting) we built the binary digits in the first `nbin` characters but in reverse order (LSB first). Then we reversed the first `nbin` characters to get the correct order.\n\n  So now we have the binary string in bin_str(1:nbin).\n\n  Then we run the DP of the second program on the string `bin_str(1:nbin)`. \n\n  The second program uses a DP array of size [n+1][2]. We'll use a 2D array `dp(0:n, 0:1)`.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n      integer :: dp(0:nbin, 0:1)\n      dp(0,0) = 1\n      dp(0,1) = 0   ! but the Java code initializes only dp[0][0]=1, so we set dp(0,0)=1 and dp(0,1)=0.\n\n      Then for i from 0 to nbin-1:\n          if bin_str(i+1) is '0' then\n              dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n              dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n              then: dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2) mod M\n          else   ! it is '1'\n              dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)\n              then: \n                  dp(i+1,0) = mod(dp(i,0)*2, M)\n                  dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + mod(dp(i,1)*2, M), M)\n          end if\n\n      Actually, the Java code does:\n\n          if (s[i] == '0') {\n              dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n              dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n              // Then add: \n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n          } else {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n              // Then:\n              dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;   // but wait, note: the second part is independent?\n              // Actually, the Java code does:\n              //   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n              //   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n          }\n\n      But note: in the '1' branch, the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]), then the second part adds (dp[i][0]*2) to dp[i+1][0] and (dp[i][1]*2) to dp[i+1][1]. \n\n      So we can break the '1' branch into:\n\n          dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) , M)\n          dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i,0)*2 , M)   ! note: this is assigned, not added? But in the Java code it is added? \n\n      Actually, the Java code:\n\n          if (s[i]=='0') {\n              ... then add for the second part: \n                  dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n          } else {\n              // First: sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) % M\n              // Then: \n                  dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;   // but wait, the Java code doesn't have an addition for dp[i+1][0] in the first part? \n          }\n\n      Actually, the Java code for '1':\n\n          else {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;   // this sets dp[i+1][1] to that value (overwriting any previous value? but there was none)\n          }\n\n          then, regardless of the character, there is a second part:\n\n          if (s[i]=='0') {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n          } else {\n              dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n          }\n\n      Actually, the Java code has:\n\n          if (s[i] == '0') {\n              ... \n          } else {\n              ... \n          }\n\n          // Then, separately:\n\n          if (s[i] == '0') {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n          } else {\n              dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n          }\n\n      Actually, the entire code for one character is:\n\n          if (s[i] == '0') {\n              dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n              dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n          } else {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n          }\n\n          if (s[i] == '0') {\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n          } else {\n              dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n              dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n          }\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if (s(i+1) == '0') then\n              dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n              dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n              ! then add:\n              dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( dp(i,1)*2, M ), M)\n          else\n              dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)\n              ! then add:\n              dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + mod( dp(i,0)*2, M), M)   ! but note: initially dp(i+1,0) is not set? Actually, in the else branch above, we only set dp(i+1,1). So dp(i+1,0) is initially zero? \n\n          Actually, in the Java code, the array is allocated as `new int[n+1][2]` and then initialized to zero? So in the else branch, before the second part, dp[i+1][0] is 0? Then we add.\n\n          But in Fortran, we should initialize the new dp row to zero? Or we can do:\n\n          We'll initialize the entire dp array to zero? Then we set:\n\n          for i in 0..nbin:\n              for j in 0:1\n                 dp(i,j)=0\n\n          Then set dp(0,0)=1.\n\n          Then for each step:\n\n             if (char is '0') then\n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)   -> so we set it to that value (overwriting the zero)\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n                 then: dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2\n             else\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,0) + dp(i,1)   -> sets to that\n                 then: \n                     dp(i+1,0) = dp(i+1,0) + dp(i,0)*2\n                     dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + dp(i,1)*2\n             end if\n\n          But note: in the '0' branch, the second part adds to dp(i+1,1) which we just set to dp(i,1). So then we get: dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1) = 3 * dp(i,1) ?\n\n          However, the Java code does:\n\n            if (s[i]=='0') {\n                dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n                dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n                // then in the next if (which is also for '0') they do:\n                dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n            }\n\n          So it becomes: dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] + 2 * dp[i][1] = 3 * dp[i][1] ?\n\n          But the example in the problem might be different.\n\n          Actually, the problem is: \n          We are counting the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b = a xor b, and a+b <= L (which is given as a binary string).\n\n          The recurrence is known: \n          Let dp[i][0] = number of ways for the prefix such that the sum is strictly less than L's prefix, and dp[i][1] = equal so far.\n\n          Then for a '0' in L at position i:\n            - If we are in the equal state, then we can only choose (0,0) -> then state remains equal? and then there's an additional part for the free choices? \n\n          The recurrence in the Java code might be correct. We follow it.\n\n      So in Fortran, we do:\n\n          dp(0,0) = 1\n          dp(0,1) = 0\n\n          do i = 0, nbin-1\n             if (bin_str(i+1:i+1) == '0') then\n                 dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)   ! from the first part\n                 dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n                 ! then the second part: \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( dp(i,1)*2, M ), M)\n             else\n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)   ! from the first part\n                 ! then the second part: \n                 dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + mod( dp(i,0)*2, M), M)   ! note: dp(i+1,0) was not set in the first part, so it was 0? \n                 dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( dp(i,1)*2, M), M)\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          Then the answer is mod( dp(nbin,0) + dp(nbin,1), M)\n\nBut note: in the else branch, we set dp(i+1,1) in the first part, then we add to it in the second part. So we do:\n\n          dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i,0)+dp(i,1)) + 2 * dp(i,1)\n\n          which is: dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1)\n\nBut that doesn't match the known recurrence? \n\nActually, the known recurrence for the problem is:\n\n  Let dp[i][tight] be the number of ways for the prefix i under the constraint that the sum is less than or equal to L.\n\n  When tight is 1, we are bounded by L, and when 0, we are free.\n\n  For each bit, we consider the bits (a_i, b_i). Note: a_i and b_i are bits and a_i+b_i is the sum at that bit.\n\n  Conditions: \n      a_i and b_i must satisfy: a_i AND b_i = 0, so the only possibilities: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0).\n\n  Also, the constraint of being less than or equal to L.\n\n  The recurrence:\n\n      If tight=1 and the current bit of L is 0:\n          Then we can only choose (0,0) because (0,1) or (1,0) would make the sum 1 which is >0 -> not allowed? But wait, the entire number? \n\n      Actually, the known solution is:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] = (if not tight: then we have 3 choices for (a_i,b_i) and then the next state is not tight) \n          dp[i+1][1] = ... \n\n  But the code we have is the one from the atcoder submission. We trust the code.\n\n  So we follow the code.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      integer :: M_mod = 1000000007\n      integer(kind=8) or just integer? The numbers can be up to 1000000007*3, so we use integer(kind=8) to avoid overflow? Or we do mod at every step.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      integer :: dp(0:max_bin_len, 0:1)   ! max_bin_len is the length of the binary string (which we set to 50, so we can do 0:50)\n\n  But note: the binary string length is at most 50, so we can set:\n\n      integer, parameter :: max_bin_len = 50\n\n  Steps:\n\n      ! First program: read N, M (the first M is the number of edges; note: the first program uses M for two things? Actually, the first program reads two integers: N and M (the number of edges). Then the array H of size N, then M edges.\n\n      ! Then process the edges.\n\n      ! Then count the number of true in the boolean array.\n\n      ! Then convert that count to a binary string.\n\n      ! Then run the DP for the second program.\n\n      ! Then output the result.\n\nNow, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nNote: The first program uses M as the number of edges. We'll call it `n_edges` to avoid confusion with the modulus.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n      integer :: N, n_edges   ! because the first program: N and M (the next is the number of edges, which we call n_edges)\n      integer, allocatable :: H(:)\n      logical, allocatable :: ans(:)\n\n      ! Read N and n_edges\n      read(*,*) N, n_edges\n\n      allocate(H(N))\n      allocate(ans(N))\n\n      do i=1, N\n          read(*,*) H(i)\n          ans(i) = .true.\n      end do\n\n      do i=1, n_edges\n          read(*,*) a, b\n          ! note: the Java code uses 1-indexed indices? Actually, it subtracts 1: so a-1 and b-1.\n          if (H(a) < H(b)) then\n              ans(a) = .false.\n          else if (H(a) > H(b)) then\n              ans(b) = .false.\n          else\n              ans(a) = .false.\n              ans(b) = .false.\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      count_val = 0\n      do i=1, N\n          if (ans(i)) count_val = count_val + 1\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, convert count_val to a binary string.\n\n      ... (as above)\n\n      ! Then run the DP for the second program.\n\n      ... (as above)\n\n      ! Then output the result of the DP.\n\nBut note: the first program uses long for H? In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for H? The problem says M is long in Java, but for the first program M is the number of edges (which is integer). The H array is long. But in Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for H.\n\nBut the input integers for the edges are integers.\n\nSo we declare:\n\n      integer(kind=4) :: N, n_edges   ! but N and n_edges are up to 10^5, which is within 4-byte integer.\n      integer(kind=8), allocatable :: H(:)\n      logical, allocatable :: ans(:)\n      integer(kind=4) :: count_val   ! because N is up to 10^5, so count_val is at most 10^5, which is within 4-byte.\n\nBut to be safe, we can use integer(kind=4) for all indices and counts.\n\nHowever, the second program's DP uses a modulus and the numbers can be big, so we use integer(kind=8) for the DP array? Because the modulus is 1000000007, and the DP values can be up to 3*1000000007, so we use integer(kind=8) for the DP.\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n      integer :: M_mod = 1000000007\n      integer :: dp(0:max_bin_len, 0:1)   ! but then we do modulo arithmetic, so we use integer(kind=4) for the modulus? Actually, 1000000007 is within 4-byte integer, but when we multiply by 2 we get up to 2000000014, which is within 4-byte? Actually, 4-byte signed integer maximum is 2147483647, so 2000000014 is safe.\n\n      However, if we do: dp(i,0)*2, then 1000000007*2 = 2000000014, which is safe. Then we mod by 1000000007.\n\n      But then we add: we might have up to 2000000014 + 2000000014 = 4000000028, which is above 2147483647? So we need 8-byte integers for the intermediate.\n\n      So we use integer(kind=8) for the DP values and for the modulus arithmetic.\n\n      Let's define:\n\n          integer, parameter :: k8 = selected_int_kind(18)\n          integer(kind=k8) :: M_mod = 1000000007_k8\n\n      Or we can use:\n\n          integer, parameter :: M_mod = 1000000007\n          integer(kind=8) :: temp_val\n\n      But we can also do:\n\n          We'll use 8-byte integers for the DP and for the intermediate computations.\n\n      So:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:max_bin_len, 0:1)\n\n      And then do modulo with M_mod (which we also define as 8-byte? or as 4-byte? Actually, 1000000007 is 4-byte. But to avoid conversion, we can define:\n\n          integer(kind=8), parameter :: M_mod = 1000000007_8\n\n      Or we can use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: M_mod = 1000000007\n\n      But the best is to define as a parameter:\n\n          integer, parameter :: M_mod = 1000000007   ! this is 4-byte? But when we do modulo, we can use 8-byte for the intermediate.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i,0)*2, M_mod )   -> but if dp(i,0) is 8-byte and M_mod is 4-byte, it will be converted.\n\n      To be safe, we define:\n\n          integer(kind=8), parameter :: M_mod = 1000000007_8\n\n      Then use 8-byte integers for the DP.\n\nNow, we write the entire Fortran program.\n\nNote: We assume the maximum length for the binary string is 50.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n      integer, parameter :: max_bin_len = 50\n\nBut the actual length of the binary string is `nbin` (<=50). Then the DP array is dimensioned (0:max_bin_len, 0:1). But we run the DP for nbin steps.\n\nCode:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined_program\n    implicit none\n\n    !

Or we can cast:\n\n        mod( 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> but 2 is 4-byte? and if dp(i,1) is 8-byte, then the multiplication is 8-byte? Actually, the constant 2 in Fortran is default integer. To avoid overflow, we can use:\n\n        mod( int(2, kind=8) * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n        mod( 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   ! but 2*dp(i,1) might be large? But if dp(i,1) is 8-byte, then 2 is promoted? \n\nActually, in Fortran, if you multiply an integer(8) by an integer(4), the result is integer(8). So it should be safe.\n\nBut to be explicit, we can use:\n\n        mod( 2_8 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nAlternatively, we can define a constant:\n\n        integer(kind=8), parameter :: two = 2\n\nBut we'll use `2_8`.\n\nHowever, note: the modulus operation: we do mod( a + b, M_mod) and mod( a * b, M_mod). We are doing modulo at every step to keep numbers within 8-byte range.\n\nBut the modulus M_mod is 1000000007, which is less than 2^30, so the intermediate results (even if we do 2 * M_mod) are less than 2^31, which is within 4-byte? But we are using 8-byte integers for dp, so we are safe.\n\nBut to avoid overflow in the multiplication: 2 * dp(i,1) might be up to 2 * M_mod (which is about 2e9) and then we mod by M_mod. But 2e9 is within 8-byte? Actually, it's 2000000000, which is less than 2^31? Actually, 2^31 is 2147483648, so 2000000000 is safe. So we can do 4-byte for everything? \n\nBut we did declare dp as 8-byte. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the DP values can be as big as M_mod (which is 1000000007) and then we multiply by 2: so maximum 2000000014, which is less than 2^31, so 4-byte integers are safe? But then why did we use 8-byte? Actually, the DP array was declared as 8-byte. We could use 4-byte for the entire program? \n\nBut the problem: the first program has H as long in Java (64-bit). So we must use 8-byte for H. But for the DP, the numbers are modulo 1000000007, so they are less than 1000000007, which fits in 4-byte. However, when we multiply by 2 we get up to 2000000014, which is too big for 4-byte? Because 2147483647 is the maximum 4-byte signed integer. So 2000000014 is less than 2147483647? Actually, 2000000014 < 2147483647 -> true. So we can use 4-byte for the DP.\n\nBut to be safe, we use 8-byte for the DP to avoid any overflow in intermediate calculations.\n\nBut note: the multiplication: 2 * dp(i,1) might be 2 * 1000000007 = 2000000014, which is within 4-byte? Actually, 2000000014 is less than 2147483647? \n\nYes, 2147483647 is 2^31-1 = 2147483647, and 2000000014 < 2147483647.\n\nSo we can use 4-byte for the DP? But the problem: the first program uses 8-byte for H, but the second program's DP values are integers modulo 1000000007. We can use 4-byte for the DP.\n\nBut we declared dp as 8-byte. We can change to:\n\n        integer :: dp(0:max_bin_len, 0:1)   ! 4-byte\n\nBut then we have to be cautious: \n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M_mod)   ! mod returns an integer? But the arguments are 4-byte, and M_mod is 4-byte? \n\nActually, we can do:\n\n        integer :: M_mod = 1000000007\n        integer :: dp(0:max_bin_len, 0:1)\n\n        ...\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( int(dp(i,0)) + int(dp(i,1)), M_mod )   ? Not necessary.\n\nBut the modulus function in Fortran for integers: \n\n        mod(a, b) returns the same type as a and b.\n\nSo if we use 4-byte, then:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\n        and\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod(2 * dp(i,1), M_mod), M_mod)\n\nBut 2*dp(i,1) might be 2*1000000007 = 2000000014, which is acceptable in 4-byte? \n\nBut 2000000014 is less than 2147483647, so it is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod( int(2, kind=4) * dp(i,1), M_mod), M_mod)\n\nBut we don't need to. So we change the dp to 4-byte? \n\nBut the problem: the first program has H as 8-byte, but the rest (like count_val) is 4-byte. The second program's DP can be 4-byte.\n\nSo we change the dp to 4-byte.\n\nBut note: the initialization:\n\n        dp(0,0)=1   -> 4-byte integer.\n\nSo we adjust:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined_program\n    implicit none\n\n    !

Because we set the entire dp to zero at the beginning? Actually, we set dp=0 at the start of the DP, but then we do the loop for i=0 to nbin-1, and we set dp(i+1,0) and dp(i+1,1). And we don't use dp(i+1,0) or dp(i+1,1) before setting? So yes, they are zero.\n\nBut in the else branch, we first set dp(i+1,1) in the first part, then we set dp(i+1,0) and dp(i+1,1) in the second part. So the second part is adding to dp(i+1,0) and dp(i+1,1). But initially, dp(i+1,0) is zero and dp(i+1,1) was set in the first part. So the second part adds to it.\n\nWe do:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0)+dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> sets dp(i+1,1) to a value\n        then: \n            dp(i+1,0) = 0 + mod(2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)   -> sets dp(i+1,0) to that mod value\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i+1,1) + mod(2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> then mod again\n\nBut the Java code does:\n\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n\nSo it is adding. So our code is correct.\n\nHowever, we are doing mod at every step? The Java code does mod at every assignment? \n\nIn the else branch, the Java code:\n\n      dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;   // first part\n      // then:\n      dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n      dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n\nSo we do:\n\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0)+dp(i,1), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + mod(2 * dp(i,0), M_mod), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod(2 * dp(i,1), M_mod), M_mod)\n\nBut we can also do without nested mod:\n\n      dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBecause mod(a+b, M) = mod( mod(a,M) + mod(b,M), M) ? \n\nYes, but to avoid overflow, we do mod at every step? But we are using 4-byte and the numbers are safe? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n      dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBut we are already doing mod on the multiplication? Actually, we don't need to mod the multiplication separately? We can mod the entire expression.\n\nSo we change to:\n\n        if (bin_str(i+1:i+1) == '0') then\n            dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n        else\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M_mod )\n            dp(i+1,0) = mod( dp(i+1,0) + 2 * dp(i,0), M_mod)\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n        end if\n\nBut note: in the '0' branch, we do:\n\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBut initially, dp(i+1,1) was set to dp(i,1). So:\n\n            = mod( dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod) = mod(3 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nSimilarly, in the else branch, we set dp(i+1,1) to (dp(i,0)+dp(i,1)) mod M_mod, then add 2 * dp(i,1) mod M_mod.\n\nBut we can combine the addition:\n\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod)   -> but wait, we also set dp(i+1,0) to 2 * dp(i,0). And dp(i+1,1) is also added 2 * dp(i,1). So it is:\n\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i,0) + dp(i,1) + 2 * dp(i,1), M_mod) = mod( dp(i,0) + 3 * dp(i,1), M_mod)\n\nBut the original Java code does two separate assignments? \n\nActually, the Java code does:\n\n        if (s[i]=='0') {\n            dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n            dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n        } else {\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n            dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0]*2) % M;\n            dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1]*2) % M;\n        }\n\nSo it is exactly what we did.\n\nBut note: in the else branch, the assignment to dp[i+1][0] is adding to what was there? But in the else branch, before the second part, dp[i+1][0] is 0? So we are effectively setting it to (0 + 2 * dp[i][0]) % M.\n\nBut in the '0' branch, we are setting dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1] and then adding 2 * dp[i][1]. \n\nSo we are doing the same.\n\nTherefore, the code is as above.\n\nLet me test with a small input:\n\nFirst program:\n\nInput: \n  4 3\n  1 2 3 4\n  1 3\n  1 4\n  2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\n  H = [1,2,3,4]\n  ans = [true, true, true, true]\n\n  Edge (1,3): H[0]=1 < H[2]=3 -> mark ans[0]=false.\n  Edge (1,4): H[0]=1 < H[3]=4 -> mark ans[0] is already false.\n  Edge (2,3): H[1]=2 < H[2]=3 -> mark ans[1]=false.\n\n  Then ans[0]=false, ans[1]=false, ans[2]=true, ans[3]=true -> count_val=2.\n\nConvert 2 to binary: \"10\"\n\nSecond program on \"10\":\n\n  nbin=2\n  dp[0][0]=1, dp[0][1]=0.\n\n  i=0: character '1'\n        dp[1][1] = mod( dp[0][0]+dp[0][1], M_mod) = mod(1+0, M_mod)=1\n        then: \n            dp[1][0] = mod(0 + 2 * dp[0][0], M_mod) = mod(2*1, M_mod)=2\n            dp[1][1] = mod(1 + 2 * dp[0][1], M_mod)= mod(1+0, M_mod)=1\n\n        So after i=0: dp[1][0]=2, dp[1][1]=1.\n\n  i=1: character '0'\n        dp[2][0]=dp[1][0]=2\n        dp[2][1]=dp[1][1]=1\n        then: dp[2][1] = mod(1 + 2 * dp[1][1], M_mod) = mod(1+2*1, M_mod)=3\n\n        Then dp[2][0]=2, dp[2][1]=3 -> total = 5.\n\n  Output: 5.\n\nBut the known answer for the second program when the input is \"10\" (which is 2) is 5? \n\nActually, the problem \"Sum Equals Xor\" asks for the number of pairs (a,b) such that a+b = a XOR b and a+b <= L.\n\nFor L=2 (binary \"10\"), the valid pairs (a,b) are:\n\n    (0,0): 0+0=0, 0 XOR 0=0 -> valid.\n    (0,1): 0+1=1, 0 XOR 1=1 -> valid.\n    (1,0): same as above -> valid.\n    (0,2): 0+2=2, 0 XOR 2=2 -> valid? but a+b=2 which is <=2 -> valid.\n    (1,1): 1+1=2, 1 XOR 1=0 -> not equal -> invalid.\n    (2,0): same as (0,2) -> valid.\n    (1,2): 1+2=3, 1 XOR 2=3 -> 3? actually 1 XOR 2 = 3? \n        In binary: 01 XOR 10 = 11 -> 3? and 1+2=3 -> equal? -> valid. But 3<=2? no, so invalid.\n    (2,1): same -> invalid.\n    (2,2): 2+2=4, 2 XOR 2=0 -> invalid.\n\nSo the valid pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,2), (2,0) -> 5.\n\nSo 5 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nWe write the final Fortran program."
