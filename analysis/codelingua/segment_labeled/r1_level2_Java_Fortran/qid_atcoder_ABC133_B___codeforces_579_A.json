  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_ABC133_B) reads input and produces an integer output. The second program (codeforces_579_A) reads an integer and produces another integer.\n\nHowever, note that the second program expects to read from standard input. But in the chain, the output of the first program becomes the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, we must combine them so that:\n- The entire input for the first program is read at the beginning.\n- The first program's output (an integer) is computed and then used as the input to the second program.\n- The second program's output (another integer) is printed at the end.\n\nBut note: The first program reads:\n   N D\n   then N vectors of D integers.\n\nThe second program reads a single integer (n).\n\nSo the chain is: \n   Input: [N, D, followed by N*D integers] \n   -> First program computes an integer (let's call it X) \n   -> Second program takes X as input and computes an integer Y \n   -> Output: Y.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We read the initial input: two integers N and D, and then a matrix of N rows and D columns.\n\n2. We compute the first program's result (X) without printing it. This involves:\n   - For every pair of vectors (i, j) with i < j, compute the squared Euclidean distance (as an integer).\n   - Then take the square root and check if it is an integer (within a tolerance of 0.001).\n   - Count the number of pairs for which the distance is integer.\n\n3. Then, we take the integer X and use it as input to the second program. The second program:\n   - Converts X to a binary string (but we don't need to form the string explicitly, we can count the ones directly).\n   - Counts the number of ones in the binary representation of X.\n\n4. Finally, we output the result of the second program (the count of ones).\n\nImportant: The second program in the chain does not read from the console but gets the output of the first program as its input. So we must avoid any I/O in between.\n\nWe can combine the two programs as follows:\n\n  Step 1: Read N and D, then the matrix.\n  Step 2: Compute the integer X (from the first program's logic).\n  Step 3: For the second program, instead of reading, we use X as n.\n          Then we count the number of ones in the binary representation of X.\n\n  Step 4: Print the count.\n\nLet's write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nNote: In Fortran, we have to declare variables and arrays appropriately.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  integer :: N, D\n  integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)   ! (N, D)\n  integer :: i, j, k, dist, x, temp\n  integer :: answer1 = 0   ! the result of the first program\n  integer :: answer2 = 0   ! the result of the second program\n  real :: sq\n\n  Read the first two integers: N, D\n  Allocate the matrix with dimensions (N, D) and read the matrix.\n\n  Then, the nested loops for the first program.\n\n  Then, for the second program, we set n = answer1, and then count the number of ones.\n\n  Print answer2.\n\nHowever, note: the second Java program builds a string of the binary representation and then counts the ones. We can avoid the string by using bit operations or by repeatedly dividing by two and counting the remainders.\n\nBut note: the Java program does:\n\n   while (n > 0) {\n        x = n % 2;\n        n /= 2;\n        s += x;   // but note: this builds the binary in reverse order (LSB first) but then we traverse the string from index0 to end? \n        Actually, the string is built from LSB to MSB, but then the for loop traverses from the first character (which is the LSB) to the last (which is the MSB). However, the count of ones is independent of order.\n\n   }\n\nBut we don't need the string. We can do:\n\n   temp = answer1\n   count = 0\n   do while (temp > 0)\n      if (mod(temp,2) == 1) count = count + 1\n      temp = temp / 2   ! integer division\n   end do\n\nBut note: in Java, integer division by 2 is truncating toward zero? Actually, for nonnegative numbers it's the same as floor division. Since our answer1 is nonnegative (a count), we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `popcnt` intrinsic if available, but to be portable, we can do the loop.\n\nHowever, the problem says: translate the entire sequence. We are going to do the same algorithm as the second Java program: we build a string? Actually, we don't need to build the string. We can just count the ones in the remainders.\n\nBut note: the Java program builds the string and then traverses the entire string. However, the remainders we get are the same as the bits in reverse order, but we are only interested in the count of ones. So we can do without the string.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  1. Read N, D and the matrix.\n  2. Compute answer1 (the count of integer-distance pairs) for the first program.\n  3. Set n = answer1, then count the ones in the binary representation of n (without building a string) by the loop method.\n  4. Print the count (answer2).\n\nBut note: the first program uses a tolerance check for integer square root. We do:\n\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   then check: if (abs(sq - floor(sq+0.001)) < 0.001) then ... \n\nActually, the Java code: \n   Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001\n\nBut note: because of floating point precision, we might have issues. Alternatively, we can check if the square root is integer by:\n\n   if (abs(sq - real(nint(sq))) < 0.001) then ... \n\nBut the original code uses floor and then checks the fractional part.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   real :: sq, frac\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   frac = sq - floor(sq)\n   if (frac < 0.001 .or. frac > 0.999) then ... \n\nBut note: the fractional part is between 0 and 1. If the fractional part is very close to 0 (meaning the number is nearly integer) OR if it is very close to 1? Actually, no: because if the fractional part is 0.999, then the number is floor(sq) + 0.999, which is not integer. We are only interested when the fractional part is near 0.\n\nBut wait: what if the square root is 3.999? Then we might want to consider it as integer 4? However, the Euclidean distance is an integer only if the squared distance is a perfect square. And the square root of a perfect square is an integer. So the fractional part should be 0. But due to floating point, we might get 3.9999999 because of rounding. However, the original code only checks the fractional part being close to 0. It doesn't check for near 1.\n\nBut note: if the squared distance is 16, then sqrt(16)=4.0 -> fractional part 0.0.\nIf the squared distance is 15, then sqrt(15)=3.872... -> fractional part 0.872.\n\nBut if the squared distance is 17, then sqrt(17)=4.123... -> fractional part 0.123.\n\nSo we only need to check if the fractional part is very close to 0.\n\nHowever, what about 4.0 vs 3.9999999? The floor of 3.9999999 is 3, and the fractional part is 0.9999999. Then we would miss. So we must check both?\n\nAlternatively, we can check the nearest integer:\n\n   if (abs(sq - anint(sq)) < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut note: the original code uses floor. Actually, the original code checks the fractional part by subtracting the floor. So that fractional part is in [0,1). Therefore, we only have to check if it is less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999? Actually, no: because if the fractional part is 0.999, that means the number is k + 0.999, which is not an integer. But if the number is 3.9999999999, then it is actually 4.0? That might be due to rounding. So we should check the distance to the nearest integer.\n\nBetter approach: check the absolute difference to the nearest integer.\n\nSo:\n\n   real :: sq, diff\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   diff = abs(sq - nint(sq))\n\nBut note: nint rounds to the nearest integer. Then we can check:\n\n   if (diff < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut the original code uses floor and then checks the fractional part. However, the two methods are equivalent for numbers that are very close to an integer? Not exactly: if the number is 4.0, both are 0.0. If the number is 3.999999, then:\n\n   fractional part = 0.999999 -> which is > 0.001, so the original code would not count it.\n\nBut if the number is 4.000001, then:\n\n   fractional part = 0.000001 -> <0.001, so counted.\n\nBut 3.999999: the nearest integer is 4, and the difference to 4 is 0.000001, which is <0.001? So we would count it by the nearest integer method.\n\nTherefore, to be consistent with the original, we must do the same: check the fractional part (the part below the floor). The original code does not consider the nearest integer but the floor.\n\nBut note: the Euclidean distance is nonnegative, so we don't have negative numbers.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   if ( (sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001 .or. (ceiling(sq) - sq) < 0.001 ) then ...\n\nBut that might be overkill. Alternatively, we can check the square root by integer candidate.\n\nA better way: since the squared distance is an integer, we can check if it is a perfect square by:\n\n   k = nint(sq)\n   if (k*k == dist) then ...\n\nBut note: k must be an integer. This avoids floating point inaccuracies.\n\nHowever, the squared distance might be large, and we are using integer arithmetic. But Fortran integers are typically 4 bytes, but the problem doesn't specify the range. We'll assume that the squared distance fits in an integer.\n\nBut note: the original uses floating point and a tolerance. We can do the integer method if we are sure that the squared distance is within the range of integers and that we can compute k without overflow? The problem does not specify constraints.\n\nBut the original Java code uses floating point and tolerance. To be safe, we can do:\n\n   k = nint(sq)\n   if (abs(sq - real(k)) < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut then we must check that k*k is close to dist? Actually, the original only uses the floating point value.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   k1 = floor(sq)\n   k2 = ceiling(sq)\n   if (abs(sq - real(k1)) < 0.001 .or. abs(sq - real(k2)) < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut that is two checks.\n\nBut note: the tolerance is 0.001. The original only checks the fractional part (which is relative to the floor). Actually, the fractional part is sq - k1, so we check if that is <0.001. But what if the fractional part is 0.999? Then we are not close to k1, but we are close to k2? Then we should count? Because 0.999 is very close to 1, meaning we are close to k2 = k1+1.\n\nSo we should check the distance to the nearest integer. So:\n\n   diff = min( abs(sq - real(floor(sq))), abs(sq - real(ceiling(sq))) )\n   but note: the distance to the ceiling: ceiling(sq) - sq, and to the floor: sq - floor(sq). Actually, the fractional part is sq - floor(sq), and the distance to the ceiling is ceiling(sq) - sq.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n   diff = min( sq - floor(sq), ceiling(sq) - sq )\n   if (diff < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut note: the fractional part (sq - floor(sq)) is always <=0.5? Not necessarily: if the fractional part is 0.6, then the distance to the ceiling is 0.4, which is smaller. So we want the minimum of the two.\n\nBut the original code does not do that. The original code only checks the fractional part (the distance to the floor). So it would not count 3.999? But 3.999 is very close to 4, which is an integer. So the original code might have a flaw? \n\nLooking at the original Java code: it does:\n\n   double sq = Math.sqrt(dist);\n   answer += (Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001 ? 1 : 0);\n\nThis only checks the fractional part. But 3.999: \n   sq = 3.999, floor(sq)=3, so the fractional part is 0.999, which is not <0.001 -> not counted.\n\nBut 3.999 is 4-0.001, which is very close to 4. So we should count it. Therefore, the original code might be incorrect for such cases.\n\nHowever, note that the squared distance is an integer. The square root of an integer is either integer or irrational. So we should only get fractional parts that are 0 (if integer) or not zero (if irrational). But due to floating point imprecision, we might get a non-integer that is very close to an integer.\n\nSo the original code is trying to account for floating point imprecision by a tolerance. But the tolerance check is only one-sided. This might miss when the square root is just below an integer? \n\nTherefore, we should do a two-sided check? But the problem says: translate. So we must do the same as the original, even if it has a flaw? Or should we fix it?\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must replicate the behavior, including any flaws.\n\nBut let me test with an example: dist=15 -> sqrt=3.872... -> fractional part=0.872 -> not counted. dist=16 -> sqrt=4.0 -> fractional part=0 -> counted. dist=17 -> sqrt=4.123... -> fractional part=0.123 -> not counted.\n\nWhat about dist= (nearly a perfect square) 16-epsilon? But dist is an integer. The next perfect square is 16, then 25. What about 15? It's not a perfect square. But 8: sqrt(8)=2.828... -> fractional part 0.828.\n\nBut what about 2: sqrt(2)=1.414... -> fractional part 0.414.\n\nBut consider 10000000000000001? That might be a problem. But we don't know the range.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   integer :: k, k1, k2\n   real :: sq\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   k1 = floor(sq)\n   k2 = k1 + 1\n   if (abs(sq - real(k1)) < 0.001 .or. abs(sq - real(k2)) < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut that is two checks. But the original only checks the floor. So we must do the same.\n\nTherefore, we do:\n\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n   if ( (sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001 ) then\n        answer1 = answer1 + 1\n   end if\n\nBut what if the fractional part is 0.999? Then we skip. Even if the number is 3.999, which is very close to 4, we skip. That's what the original does.\n\nSo we do the same.\n\nHowever, note: the original uses `Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq))` but the fractional part is nonnegative? So the absolute is the same as the fractional part.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n   if ( (sq - real(floor(sq, kind=4))) < 0.001 ) then\n        answer1 = answer1 + 1\n   endif\n\nBut note: the fractional part might be negative? No, because sq >= floor(sq).\n\nSo we can write:\n\n   if ( sq - real(floor(sq)) < 0.001 ) then\n\nBut wait: what if the fractional part is very close to 1? Then we are missing the case when it should be rounded to the next integer? But the original code does not consider that. So we stick to the original.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the intrinsic `fractional` part? We just subtract the floor.\n\nBut note: the floor function in Fortran for real numbers: we can use `floor` but it returns a real? Actually, the `floor` function returns a real by default? We can use:\n\n   integer :: int_part\n   real :: frac_part\n   int_part = floor(sq)   ! But floor returns real? Actually, we can use the intrinsic that returns integer.\n\nIn Fortran, we have:\n\n   int_part = floor(sq)   ! This is not standard? Actually, we can use the intrinsic `floor` from ISO_C_BINDING? But to avoid, we can do:\n\n   int_part = int(sq)      ! This truncates toward zero. But for positive numbers, it is the same as floor.\n\n   However, for sq=3.999, int(sq)=3. But note: the fractional part = sq - int(sq) = 0.999.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   frac_part = sq - real(int(sq))\n\nBut then we check: if (frac_part < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut note: if sq is negative? It can't be because it's a distance.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if the fractional part is negative? No, because sq is nonnegative and int(sq) <= sq.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   integer :: intpart\n   real :: fracpart\n   intpart = int(sq)   ! same as floor for nonnegative\n   fracpart = sq - real(intpart)\n   if (fracpart < 0.001) then\n        answer1 = answer1 + 1\n   end if\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the temporary variable:\n\n   if (sq - real(int(sq)) < 0.001) then ...\n\nBut note: if the fractional part is 0.999, then we skip.\n\nThis matches the original Java code.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n   do i = 1, N-1\n      do j = i+1, N\n         dist = 0\n         do k = 1, D\n            x = vectors(i,k) - vectors(j,k)\n            dist = dist + x*x\n         end do\n         sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n         if (sq - real(int(sq)) < 0.001) then\n             answer1 = answer1 + 1\n         end if\n      end do\n   end do\n\nBut note: the Java code uses a tolerance of 0.001. We do the same.\n\nHowever, what if the fractional part is 0.001 exactly? Then we count? The condition is `if (fracpart < 0.001)`. That excludes 0.001. But the Java condition is `Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001`. That includes if the fractional part is 0.000999...? \n\nBut note: the condition in Java is strict: less than 0.001. So fractional part 0.001 is not included.\n\nSo we do the same.\n\nBut note: what if the distance is zero? Then sq=0.0, and fractional part = 0.0 -> counted. That's correct.\n\nNow, the second part: counting ones in the binary representation of answer1.\n\nWe do:\n\n   temp = answer1\n   answer2 = 0\n   do while (temp > 0)\n      if (mod(temp, 2) == 1) answer2 = answer2 + 1\n      temp = temp / 2   ! integer division: use integer arithmetic\n   end do\n\nBut note: in Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? For positive numbers, it's the same as floor division.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the bit_count intrinsic? But that counts the ones in the binary representation. However, the standard only has bit_count for integers of kind that supports bit manipulation. We can use:\n\n   answer2 = popcnt(answer1)\n\nBut the problem: we don't know the Fortran compiler. And the original Java program does not use bit operations but modulus and division. So we do the modulus and division for portability.\n\nBut note: the Java program builds the string in reverse order, but the count of ones is the same. So our modulus method counts the ones in the binary representation.\n\nTherefore, we'll do the modulus and division.\n\nFinally, we print answer2.\n\nLet's write the entire Fortran program.\n\nNote: We must be cautious about array indexing: the Java code uses 0-indexing, Fortran uses 1-indexing. We'll read the vectors into a 2D array of shape (N, D). Then the first vector is row 1, the second row 2, etc.\n\nBut note: the loops:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n   do i = 1, N-1\n      do j = i+1, N\n\nWe'll assume the matrix is stored as: vectors(i, d) for the i-th vector and d-th dimension.\n\nBut note: the Java code stores:\n\n   vectors[i][j] for the i-th vector and j-th dimension.\n\nWe read:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < D; j++) {\n            vectors[i][j] = sc.nextInt();\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   do i = 1, N\n      do j = 1, D\n         read *, vectors(i, j)\n\nBut note: the input order: first vector (row0) then row1, etc. So we read row by row.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the entire array with:\n\n   read *, ((vectors(i, j), j=1,D), i=1,N)\n\nBut the input is given as a sequence of integers: first two numbers (N, D), then N*D integers.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   read *, N, D\n   allocate(vectors(N, D))\n   do i = 1, N\n      do j = 1, D\n         read *, vectors(i, j)\n      end do\n   end do\n\nAlternatively, we can read the entire block without nested loops? But we don't know the order of the input. The problem says the same input.\n\nBut the input is:\n\n   N D\n   x11 x12 ... x1D\n   x21 ... x2D\n   ...\n   xN1 ... xND\n\nSo we can read row by row.\n\nNow, write the entire program.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n   program combined\n   implicit none\n   integer :: N, D, i, j, k, x, dist, temp\n   integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\n   integer :: answer1, answer2\n   real :: sq, fracpart\n   ! Read the input\n   read *, N, D\n   allocate(vectors(N, D))\n   do i = 1, N\n      do j = 1, D\n         read *, vectors(i, j)\n      end do\n   end do\n\n   ! First program: compute answer1\n   answer1 = 0\n   do i = 1, N-1\n      do j = i+1, N\n         dist = 0\n         do k = 1, D\n            x = vectors(i, k) - vectors(j, k)\n            dist = dist + x * x\n         end do\n         sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n         fracpart = sq - real(int(sq))\n         if (fracpart < 0.001) then\n            answer1 = answer1 + 1\n         end if\n      end do\n   end do\n\n   ! Second program: use answer1 as n\n   temp = answer1\n   answer2 = 0\n   do while (temp > 0)\n      if (mod(temp,2) == 1) then\n         answer2 = answer2 + 1\n      end if\n      temp = temp / 2\n   end do\n\n   ! Output the answer2\n   print *, answer2\n\n   end program\n\nBut note: the condition in the first program: we are checking if the fractional part is less than 0.001. But what if the fractional part is negative? It shouldn't be. So it's safe.\n\nHowever, note: the square root of a negative number? But dist is nonnegative.\n\nWe can also note that if dist==0, then sq=0.0, and int(sq)=0, fracpart=0.0 -> counted.\n\nBut what if dist is huge? The real might not be able to represent it exactly? But we are using the same method as the original Java, which uses double. In Fortran, we are using the default real which might be single precision? But the problem does not specify the range.\n\nTo be safe, we can use double precision? But the original Java code uses double (Math.sqrt returns double). So we should use double precision for the square root and the fractional part.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\n   real(kind=8) :: sq, fracpart   ! or use double precision\n\nBut the problem does not specify the constraints. We'll assume the input is such that the original Java program works. So we use double precision to match Java's double.\n\nIn Fortran, we can do:\n\n   real(8) :: sq, fracpart\n\n   sq = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8))\n\nBut note: the integer dist might be large. So we convert dist to double.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n   sq = dsqrt(dble(dist))\n\nBut we'll do:\n\n   use real(8) for sq and fracpart.\n\nBut note: the tolerance 0.001 should be in double? We can write 0.001d0.\n\nSo:\n\n   sq = dsqrt(dble(dist))   ! dble converts to double precision\n   fracpart = sq - dble(floor(sq, kind=8))   ! but floor for double precision? Actually, we can use the intrinsic floor that returns a double? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   integer(8) :: intpart   ? But we don't know the size of dist. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   intpart = floor(sq)   ! but this returns a real? \n\nActually, we can use:\n\n   intpart = int(sq)   ! but this truncates to integer and then we convert to double? \n\nBut we can do:\n\n   fracpart = sq - dble(int(sq))\n\nBut note: int(sq) returns an integer? Actually, the intrinsic `int` converts a real to integer by truncation. Then we convert that integer to double for the subtraction? \n\nBut we can do:\n\n   fracpart = sq - dble(int(sq))\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nBut what if sq is very large? Then the fractional part might be computed with less precision. But we are using double precision, which has 52 bits of mantissa. So for integers that are within the range of exact representation (up to 2^53), the fractional part will be zero or non-zero appropriately.\n\nBut the dist is an integer that might be large? The original Java uses double for the square root, so we do the same.\n\nSo let me change:\n\n   integer :: N, D, i, j, k, x, dist, temp\n   integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\n   integer :: answer1, answer2\n   real(8) :: sq, fracpart   ! double precision\n\n   ... \n\n   sq = dsqrt(dble(dist))\n   fracpart = sq - dble(int(sq))\n\n   if (fracpart < 0.001d0) then\n        answer1 = answer1 + 1\n   end if\n\nBut note: the tolerance 0.001d0.\n\nAlternatively, we can write 0.001 as 1.0d-3? Or 0.001_8? \n\nWe can write 0.001_8 to get double precision.\n\nBut let me write: 0.001d0.\n\nBut note: the condition is the same as the original: we are checking the fractional part against 0.001 (double).\n\nNow, we write the program.\n\nOne more note: the integer division in the second part: we use `temp = temp / 2`. This is integer division? In Fortran, if both operands are integers, it is integer division (truncated toward zero). This matches Java for nonnegative numbers.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined\nimplicit none\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, k, x, dist, temp\ninteger, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\ninteger :: answer1, answer2\nreal(8) :: sq, fracpart\n\n!
