  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (atcoder_ABC174_C):\n  - Reads an integer K.\n  - If K is divisible by 2 or 5, it returns -1.\n  - If K is divisible by 7, it divides K by 7.\n  - Then multiplies K by 9.\n  - Then it finds the smallest positive integer `ans` such that 10^ans mod (K) = 1 (i.e., the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, if it exists).\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a string (a single character) and prints the next character (so 'a' becomes 'b', etc.).\n\nHowever, note the sequence: \n  The output of the first program (which is an integer) is used as input to the second program.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string (a single character). The output of the first program is an integer. How do we reconcile?\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads a string and then prints the next character. However, the first program outputs an integer (which may have multiple digits) and then a newline.\n\nBut the second program only reads one line and takes the first character. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", the second program will read the string \"123\" and then try to compute the next character of the first character, which is '1' -> '2'. So it outputs '2'.\n\nBut note: the first program might output a negative number? Actually, the first program outputs -1 when K is divisible by 2 or 5. So the output of the first program can be either a positive integer (the order) or -1.\n\nSo the chain:\n  Input to the whole system: an integer (for the first program)\n  Then the first program processes and outputs an integer (or -1) to stdout.\n  Then the second program reads that output (as a string) and outputs the next character of the first character of that string.\n\nHowever, note: the first program might output a multi-digit number. The second program only takes the first character.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output (including any digits and the newline) is the input to the next. But the second program only reads one line (with `r.readLine()`) and then takes the first character.\n\nSo in Fortran, we must do:\n\n  1. Read the initial integer (for the first program) from standard input.\n  2. Process as in the first Java program to compute a result (an integer, which we'll call `res1`).\n  3. Convert `res1` to a string (without any extra spaces, and without a newline at this point) and then take the first character of that string.\n  4. Then, as in the second program, convert that character to the next character (i.e., increment its ASCII value by one) and output that single character.\n\nBut note: the second Java program outputs the next character and nothing else. So the entire output of the chain is a single character.\n\nHowever, the first program might output -1. Then the string is \"-1\", and the first character is '-'. The next character of '-' is '.' (because the ASCII of '-' is 45, then 46 is '.'). But is that the intended behavior?\n\nBut the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nSo we have to mimic the exact behavior.\n\nSteps in Fortran:\n\n  Step 1: Read an integer K from standard input.\n\n  Step 2: \n      if (mod(K,2)==0 .or. mod(K,5)==0) then\n          res1 = -1\n      else\n          if (mod(K,7)==0) then\n              K = K / 7\n          end if\n          K = K * 9\n          ! Now we need to compute the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K\n          ans = 1\n          remainder = mod(10, K)\n          do while (remainder /= 1)\n              ans = ans + 1\n              remainder = mod(remainder * 10, K)\n          end do\n          res1 = ans\n      end if\n\n  Step 3: Convert the integer `res1` to a string. Then take the first character of that string.\n\n  Step 4: Compute the next character: \n          char_output = char( ichar(first_char) + 1 )\n\n  Step 5: Print that single character.\n\nHowever, note: the second program in Java uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which outputs a single character without a newline? Actually, in Java, `printf` without a newline does not add one. But then the program exits and the output might be flushed. In Fortran, we can use `write(*, '(a)', advance='no')` to avoid a newline? But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are to produce the same behavior.\n\nBut the second Java program does not output a newline. So we must output a single character without a newline.\n\nBut note: the first program uses `pw.println(solve());` which prints the integer and then a newline. So the output of the first program is the integer string and a newline. Then the second program reads the entire line (which includes the integer and the newline) but then takes the first character (which is the first digit or the minus sign) and then prints the next character without a newline.\n\nBut wait: the second program does not read the newline? Because `readLine()` consumes the entire line including the newline, but returns the string without the newline. So the string that the second program gets does not have the newline. Therefore, the first character is the first character of the integer representation.\n\nTherefore, in our Fortran program:\n\n  - We read the initial integer.\n  - Compute res1 (which is either -1 or the positive integer order).\n  - Convert res1 to a string (without any leading/trailing spaces and without a newline) and then take the first character of that string.\n  - Then output the next character (without any newline).\n\nBut note: Fortran when converting an integer to a string might have leading spaces? We must remove them? Actually, we can use an internal write and then adjust to the left? Or we can use trim? But the integer might be negative: e.g., -1 has a minus sign at the beginning.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  character(len=20) :: temp_str\n  write(temp_str, *) res1   ! This will write with a fixed format and might have leading spaces?\n  Then we want the first non-space? Actually, the Java output of an integer does not have leading spaces for negative and positive? It prints the number without any extra spaces? \n\nBut in Fortran, using list-directed write (write with *), it will put a space for positive numbers? For example, writing -1: the string will be \"        -1\" (if the field is 10 or 11) but we don't know. We can adjust the format to remove the spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without spaces:\n\n  write(temp_str, '(I0)') res1   ! I0 format writes without leading spaces.\n\nThen the string will be exactly the integer without spaces.\n\nThen we take the first character: temp_str(1:1)\n\nBut note: if the integer is negative, the first character is '-'. If positive, it is a digit.\n\nThen we compute the next character.\n\nBut what if the integer has multiple digits? We only take the first digit. For example, 123 becomes '1' then next is '2'. So we output '2'.\n\nNow, what about the newline? The entire output of the chain should be the single character (without a newline). But the original second program outputs without a newline? Actually, in the second Java program, it uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)`. This does not add a newline. So we must not add a newline.\n\nHowever, Fortran by default adds a newline at the end of a write. So we must use:\n\n  write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char_output\n\nBut note: the Fortran standard requires that the program ends with a newline? Actually, no, but the output might be buffered. We can flush? But the problem says to behave identically. The Java program flushes at the end? The second program doesn't flush explicitly, but the program exits and the system flushes.\n\nIn Fortran, we can use:\n\n  write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char_output\n  ! Then we might want to flush? But the program ends and the output will be flushed.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without advance='no' and then we output one character without newline? But the write with advance='no' does not add a newline.\n\nBut note: the entire output of the chain is one character. So we must output exactly one character and nothing else.\n\nHowever, what if the first program returns a multi-digit number? Then the second program only takes the first digit. But what about the rest of the digits? They are read by the second program as the rest of the line? But the second program only uses the first character. So we don't need to worry about the rest.\n\nBut in our Fortran, we are not actually writing the entire integer to an intermediate output and then reading it? We are simulating the chain internally. So we don't write the integer to the screen and then read it back. We just convert the integer to a string and then take the first character. The rest of the string is ignored.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  1. Read the initial integer K.\n  2. Compute the result (res1) as described.\n  3. Convert res1 to a string without spaces and without any extra characters (using I0 format).\n  4. Take the first character of that string.\n  5. Compute the next character (by converting to ASCII, adding one, then back to character).\n  6. Output that single character without a newline.\n\nBut note: what if the string is empty? That should not happen because res1 is at least -1, which is two characters? Actually, -1 is two characters. And positive numbers are at least one digit.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nImportant: The multiplicative order calculation must be done with integer arithmetic. We note that K might become large? But the problem constraints are not given. We have to use integer types that can hold K. The original Java uses int (32-bit). In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=4) or integer(kind=8). To be safe, we can use integer(kind=8) if we are concerned about large numbers? But the problem does not specify.\n\nBut note: after multiplying by 9, K might be up to 9 * 10^9 (if the original K is 10^9). Then we are doing modulus operations. The modulus operations are with numbers up to 9e9, which is within 32-bit? 32-bit integers go up to about 2e9. So 9e9 is beyond 2e9? Then we must use 64-bit integers.\n\nSo we will use integer(8) for K, remainder, and the loop variables.\n\nSteps:\n\n  program main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: temp_str\n    character :: first_char, next_char\n    integer :: io_status, len_str\n    character(len=100) :: buffer  ! For reading the input\n\n    ! Read the initial integer. We assume there is one integer in the input.\n    read(*, '(a)') buffer   ! Read the whole line to avoid problems with leading spaces\n    read(buffer, *) K_orig\n\n    K = K_orig\n\n    if (mod(K, 2_8) == 0 .or. mod(K, 5_8) == 0) then\n        res1 = -1\n    else\n        if (mod(K, 7_8) == 0) then\n            K = K / 7\n        end if\n        K = K * 9\n        ans = 1\n        remainder = mod(10_8, K)\n        do while (remainder /= 1)\n            ans = ans + 1\n            remainder = mod(remainder * 10_8, K)\n        end do\n        res1 = ans\n    end if\n\n    ! Now convert res1 to a string without leading spaces\n    ! We'll write to a buffer and then trim? Actually, we can use an internal file.\n    ! We don't know the length, so let's allocate a string of sufficient length.\n    write(buffer, '(I0)') res1   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces to the buffer (which is 100 characters, enough for any 64-bit integer)\n    ! Now we want the first character of the buffer? But note: the buffer is 100 characters, but the integer string is in the beginning and then padded with spaces? \n    ! Actually, the write with I0 will write the integer and then leave the rest undefined? But we are writing to a fixed-length buffer. Then the integer is written without leading spaces and the rest of the buffer remains as it was? \n\n    ! Instead, we can take the first non-blank? But the I0 format writes without leading spaces. However, the buffer might have trailing garbage? We only need the first character.\n\n    first_char = buffer(1:1)\n\n    ! Now compute the next character\n    next_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\n    ! Output the next_char without a newline\n    write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: what if the integer is negative? Then the first character is '-'. Then we output the character with ASCII code 45+1=46, which is '.'.\n\nThis matches the Java behavior.\n\nHowever, we must consider the possibility of overflow in the modulus loop? The problem in Java uses int, which is signed 32-bit. So if K is too large, the modulus operations might cause overflow? But in Java, the modulus operations are done with int. In our Fortran, we are using 64-bit integers. So we are safe for K_orig up to about 2e9? Because then K becomes 9 * 2e9 = 1.8e10, which is within 64-bit integers (max ~9e18).\n\nBut the original Java uses int (32-bit). So the input K must be in the range of 32-bit integers. So we can read as 32-bit? But the problem does not specify. We'll assume the input is within the range of 32-bit integers. But to match, we can use 32-bit integers? But the multiplication by 9 might overflow? For example, if K is 2e9, then multiplying by 9 gives 1.8e10 which is beyond 32-bit. So the original Java would have overflow? Then our Fortran using 64-bit would be different.\n\nBut let me check the original Java: \n   int K = readInt();\n   if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) ... \n   Then if divisible by 7, K /= 7 (integer division) then K *= 9.\n\nIf K is 2000000000 (2e9), then 2e9 * 9 = 1.8e10, which is beyond 32-bit (max 2.14e9). So it overflows. Then the modulus operations would be on a negative number? Or truncated?\n\nWe must match the Java behavior. So we should use 32-bit arithmetic? But Fortran doesn't have exactly the same overflow behavior? We can use 32-bit integers.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must use 32-bit integers.\n\nHow? We can declare:\n\n  integer(4) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n\nBut then when we do:\n\n  K = K * 9   -> might overflow.\n\nAnd the modulus operations would be modulo 2^32? But Java's int is signed, so modulus with negative numbers? \n\nBut in the original Java, the modulus operations are:\n\n  remainder = 10 % K;   // if K is negative? But note: K is positive? because we started positive and then divided by 7 (if divisible) and multiplied by 9. But if K was negative? The input is positive? The readInt() reads a positive integer? The problem doesn't say, but the modulus operations in Java for negative divisors: \n\n  The modulus operation in Java for negative numbers: the result has the same sign as the dividend. But in our case, the dividend is positive. \n\nBut if K becomes negative due to overflow? Then we are in trouble.\n\nTo be safe, we should use 32-bit integers and let it overflow as in Java.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints? The problem says that if K is divisible by 2 or 5, we return -1. Otherwise, we do the rest. And the rest requires that K is positive? Actually, the multiplicative order is defined for positive moduli.\n\nSo we must avoid negative moduli? The original Java program does not check for overflow. So we must use 32-bit to match.\n\nSo we change to 32-bit integers.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation in Fortran for negative numbers? It is defined as: \n  mod(a, p) = a - floor(real(a)/real(p)) * p\n  and the result has the same sign as a if p>0? Actually, the standard says that mod(a,p) has the sign of a if a is nonzero, and p must not be zero.\n\nBut in Java, the modulus operation for positive p: the result is nonnegative? Actually, no: in Java, the modulus can be negative? \n\nExample: 10 % (-3) -> but our p is K which is positive? Because we started with a positive integer and then multiplied by 9? So K is positive? Then in both languages, modulus with a positive divisor: the result is nonnegative? \n\nBut in our computation, the initial K is positive. Then we multiply by 9: but if it overflows, it might become negative? Then we would have a negative modulus? \n\nBut the original Java would do modulus with a negative divisor? Then the result would be negative? \n\nActually, no: the divisor in the modulus operation is K. If K becomes negative due to overflow, then the modulus operation would be with a negative divisor? \n\nBut the algorithm then? We are looking for remainder=1. But if the divisor is negative, then the modulus operation might not be what we want.\n\nTo be safe, we should use 32-bit integers and let it overflow to negative? But then the condition (remainder /= 1) might never be true? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the problem constraints might avoid such large K? The problem does not specify. But to be safe, we use 32-bit to match the Java.\n\nBut the original Java program is designed for K in a certain range? We'll assume the input K is in [1, 2^31-1]? Then after multiplying by 9, it might be beyond 2^31-1? Then overflow to negative.\n\nSo we must use 32-bit integers to get the same overflow behavior.\n\nTherefore, we declare:\n\n  integer(4) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n\nBut note: the step `K = K * 9` might overflow. Then the modulus operations would be on the overflowed value.\n\nBut the original Java program does that. So we do the same.\n\nSo the code:\n\n  program main\n    implicit none\n    integer(4) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n    character(len=100) :: buffer\n    character :: first_char, next_char\n\n    ! Read the initial integer. We assume there is one integer in the input.\n    read(*, *) K_orig\n\n    K = K_orig\n\n    if (mod(K, 2) == 0 .or. mod(K, 5) == 0) then\n        res1 = -1\n    else\n        if (mod(K, 7) == 0) then\n            K = K / 7\n        end if\n        K = K * 9\n        ans = 1\n        remainder = mod(10, K)   ! Here, if K is negative due to overflow, mod(10, K) in Fortran? \n        ! But note: the modulus function in Fortran requires a positive divisor? Actually, the standard says the second argument must be nonzero. It doesn't require positive? \n        ! But the behavior for negative divisor: \n        !   mod(10, -3) = 10 - (-3)*floor(10/(-3)) = 10 - (-3)*(-4) = 10 - 12 = -2.\n        ! In Java: 10 % (-3) = 1? Actually, no: \n        !   Java: a % b = a - b * floorDiv(a, b)\n        !   floorDiv(10, -3) = -4, so 10 % (-3) = 10 - (-3)*(-4) = 10 - 12 = -2.\n        ! So same as Fortran? \n        ! Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        do while (remainder /= 1)\n            ans = ans + 1\n            remainder = mod(remainder * 10, K)\n        end do\n        res1 = ans\n    end if\n\n    ! Now convert res1 to a string without leading spaces\n    write(buffer, '(I0)') res1   ! This will write the integer to the buffer without leading spaces, but the buffer is 100 characters. We only need the first character.\n\n    first_char = buffer(1:1)\n\n    next_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\n    write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n  end program\n\nBut note: if the integer is negative, then the first character is '-'. Then next_char is '.'.\n\nBut what if the integer is 0? The first program never returns 0? Because:\n  - If K is divisible by 2 or 5, returns -1.\n  - Otherwise, the multiplicative order is at least 1.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if the multiplicative order loop runs forever? That should not happen because we know that if K is coprime to 10, then the order exists. But note: we have already filtered out multiples of 2 and 5. So the remaining K is coprime with 10? Actually, we did:\n\n  if (K mod 2==0 or mod5==0) then return -1.\n\nBut what if K becomes 1? Then the modulus is 1. Then the loop condition: remainder starts as mod(10,1)=0. Then 0 != 1 -> loop. Then we do remainder = (0*10) mod 1 = 0. So it loops forever.\n\nBut note: when K=1, then we have:\n\n  We are computing the multiplicative order of 10 mod 1? But mod 1, every number is 0. So 10 mod1=0, and then we are stuck.\n\nBut the original Java program would also loop forever? \n\nActually, the original Java program:\n\n  if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) ... \n  Then if divisible by 7, we do K/=7. Then K*=9.\n\nSo if the input K is 7, then we do K=7/7=1, then K=1*9=9. Then we are processing K=9.\n\nBut then: 9 is divisible by ...? 9 is divisible by 2? no. by 5? no. So we go to the else.\n\nThen we set ans=1, remainder = 10 mod 9 = 1 -> the loop condition fails, so we return 1.\n\nBut wait: if we start with K=1, then we skip the divisible by 2 or 5? Then we check divisible by 7? no. Then we set K = 1*9=9. Then we do the modulus with 9: 10 mod9=1 -> returns 1.\n\nSo the only way to get K=1 is if we start with 7? and then we get 9. So we never get K=1? \n\nBut what if we start with K=1? Then we skip the divisible by 2,5? Then we don't divide by 7? Then K=1*9=9. Then we do the modulus with 9: 10 mod9=1 -> returns 1.\n\nSo the problem is only when K becomes 0? How? \n\nIf K_orig is 0? Then we get mod(0,2)=0 -> return -1.\n\nBut if K_orig is a multiple of 2 or 5, we return -1. Otherwise, we multiply by 9 and then do modulus. The modulus divisor is K (which is 9 * (K_orig / 7 if divisible by 7, or 9*K_orig). This divisor is nonzero? Because we filtered out multiples of 2 and 5, and then multiplied by 9 (which is not zero) and divided by 7 only if divisible? So K becomes at least 9? \n\nTherefore, the divisor in the modulus is at least 9? Then 10 mod K is 10 (if K>10) or ... but never 0? Because K is at least 9? Then the modulus 10 mod K is at least 1? \n\nBut if K=9, then 10 mod9=1 -> then we break the loop immediately.\n\nBut what if K=3? Then we skip the divisible by 2,5? Then we check 7? no. Then K=3*9=27. Then we do:\n  remainder = 10 mod 27 = 10\n  then 10*10 mod27 = 100 mod27 = 19\n  then 19*10 mod27 = 190 mod27 = 190 - 27*7 = 190-189=1 -> so after 3 steps.\n\nSo the loop condition is safe.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation might become 0? How? \n\nOnly if the remainder becomes 0? Then the next step: 0*10 mod K = 0, and then we are stuck. But that should not happen because we filtered out multiples of 2 and 5? \n\nBut note: after multiplying by 9, the new K is divisible by 9? Then we are computing the multiplicative order of 10 modulo a multiple of 9? But 10 and 9 are coprime? \n\nActually, we filtered out multiples of 2 and 5, so the original K is not divisible by 2 or 5. Then when we multiply by 9, we are multiplying by 3^2. So the new K might have factors 3 and possibly others (but not 2 or 5). Then 10 and K are coprime? Because 10=2*5, and K has no factors 2 or 5? \n\nBut wait: we started with K not divisible by 2 or 5. Then we multiplied by 9 (which is 3^2) so the new K still has no factors 2 or 5. Therefore, gcd(10, K)=1. So the multiplicative order exists. Therefore, we will eventually get a remainder of 1.\n\nSo the loop will terminate.\n\nTherefore, the code is safe.\n\nNow, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation in the loop: we must use the same modulus as in Java. Since we are using 32-bit integers, and the modulus operation for negative numbers is defined similarly, we are safe.\n\nOne more thing: the original Java program for the first part uses:\n\n  if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n\nBut note: in Java, integer division truncates toward zero. In Fortran, when dividing two positive integers, it truncates toward zero? Actually, Fortran integer division truncates toward zero? \n\nExample: 14/7=2, 15/7=2? Because 15/7=2.14 -> truncates to 2? Yes.\n\nSo same as Java.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\n  program main\n    implicit none\n    integer(4) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n    character(len=100) :: buffer\n    character :: first_char, next_char\n\n    ! Read the initial integer.\n    read(*, *) K_orig\n\n    K = K_orig\n\n    if (mod(K, 2) == 0 .or. mod(K, 5) == 0) then\n        res1 = -1\n    else\n        if (mod(K, 7) == 0) then\n            K = K / 7\n        end if\n        K = K * 9\n        ans = 1\n        remainder = mod(10, K)\n        do while (remainder /= 1)\n            ans = ans + 1\n            remainder = mod(remainder * 10, K)\n        end do\n        res1 = ans\n    end if\n\n    ! Convert res1 to string and take first character\n    write(buffer, '(I0)') res1\n    first_char = buffer(1:1)\n\n    next_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\n    write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n  end program\n\nLet me test with a few inputs:\n\n  Input: 1 -> expected?\n    First program: \n        K=1 -> not divisible by 2 or 5 -> then not divisible by 7? -> K = 1*9 = 9.\n        Then remainder = 10 mod 9 = 1 -> returns 1.\n        Then the second program: the string \"1\" -> first char '1' -> next char '2'. Output: '2'\n\n  Input: 2 -> first program: divisible by 2 -> returns -1.\n        Then the second program: string \"-1\" -> first char '-' -> next char '.' -> output '.'\n\n  Input: 3 -> first program: not div by 2 or 5 -> not div by 7 -> K=3*9=27.\n        Then:\n          ans=1, rem = 10 mod27=10 -> not 1 -> ans=2, rem = 10*10 mod27 = 100 mod27=19 -> not 1 -> ans=3, rem=19*10 mod27=190 mod27=190-27*7=190-189=1 -> break. So res1=3.\n        Then the second program: string \"3\" -> first char '3' -> next char '4'. Output: '4'\n\n  Input: 7 -> first program: divisible by 7 -> so K=7/7=1 -> then K=1*9=9 -> same as input 1 -> returns 1 -> then output '2'\n\nBut wait: the first program for input 7: \n        if (K%7==0) -> yes, so K=7/7=1.\n        Then K=1*9=9 -> then remainder=10 mod9=1 -> returns 1.\n\nSo output '2'.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nNow, we write the code accordingly.\n\nNote: We must be cautious about the data types. We use integer(4) for 32-bit integers.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation for negative divisors: we have argued that the behavior is the same as Java? But in our program, we avoid negative divisors? Because we filter out multiples of 2 and 5, and then we multiply by 9 (which is positive) and divide by 7 (if divisible) which is positive? So the divisor K is always positive? \n\nBut what if K_orig is negative? The problem says: the input K? The original Java reads an integer. The problem does not specify positive. But the modulus operations in the condition: mod by 2,5,7: negative moduli? \n\nBut the problem says: run on the same input. We assume the input is positive? Because the problem context? \n\nBut to be safe, the problem says the input is the same as the original chain. The original chain: the first program reads an integer. The constraints of the original problem (ABC174_C) say that K is between 1 and 10^6? Actually, I recall that problem. But the problem statement here does not specify. \n\nBut the Java code uses `int` and does not check for negative. So if we read a negative, then:\n\n  mod(K,2) might be 0? Then we return -1.\n\nSo we can handle negative? \n\nBut the multiplicative order part: if we get a negative K? Then after multiplying by 9, it becomes more negative? Then the modulus operations: the divisor is negative? \n\nBut the algorithm is defined for positive moduli? \n\nSo to be safe, we assume the input is positive? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". If we input a negative, the first Java program would return -1? Because mod(-1,2) in Java is -1? Then mod(-1,2)==0? -> false. Then mod(-1,5)==0? false. Then it would go into the else? \n\nBut then: if mod(K,7)==0? For example, K=-7: then mod(-7,7)==0? -> true. Then K = -7/7 = -1. Then K = -1 *9 = -9.\n\nThen the modulus operations: \n  remainder = 10 mod (-9) -> in Java: 10 % (-9) = 10 - (-9)*floorDiv(10, -9) \n  floorDiv(10,-9) = -2 because 10 / -9 = -1.11... -> floor is -2? \n  then 10 - (-9)*(-2) = 10 - 18 = -8.\n\nThen we do: while (remainder != 1) -> true. Then next: remainder = -8 * 10 mod (-9) = (-80) mod (-9) -> \n  -80 / -9 = 8.88... -> floorDiv(-80, -9) = 8? Then -80 - (-9)*8 = -80 + 72 = -8? \n  Then we are stuck in a loop? \n\nBut the original Java program would loop forever? \n\nTherefore, the problem likely assumes positive input? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the same input\". So we must assume the input is positive? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the original problem ABC174_C states: \n  Constraints: 1 <= K <= 10^6\n\nSo the input is positive and between 1 and 10^6.\n\nTherefore, we don't have to worry about negative.\n\nSo we can assume the input is positive.\n\nTherefore, the code is safe.\n\nFinal code:\n\n  program main\n    implicit none\n    integer(4) :: K, K_orig, remainder, ans, res1\n    character(len=100) :: buffer\n    character :: first_char, next_char\n\n    !
