We must use integer(kind=8) for ans2, n2, i, k, term to avoid overflow? Since n2 is at most 100, then k is at most 100, and term = i * k * (k+1) / 2: maximum i=100, k=100 -> 100*100*101/2 = 505000 -> which fits in 32-bit? But the problem in the second program: the input n can be up to 10^7? But in our chain, n2 is only up to 100. So it's safe. But wait: the chain: the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is the last child index (<=100). So we are safe. However, what if the constraints of the first program are changed? The problem says the original constraints: n, m <= 100, so the last child index is at most 100. So we can proceed.

If a child needs more than m, \n   the remaining (x - m) is put back in the queue along with the child's index.\n   The last child that gets exactly the remaining candies (<=m) is recorded and printed.\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_ABC172_D) does:\n   Reads an integer n.\n   Computes: ans = sum_{i=1}^{n} [ i * (floor(n/i) * (floor(n/i)+1) / 2) ]\n\n However, note the chain: the output of the first program becomes the input to the second.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs an integer (ans) and the second program reads an integer (n).\n So the chain is: \n   Input to the first program: two integers (n and m) and then n integers (the candy counts for each child).\n   Output of the first program: a single integer (the last child that got the candy).\n   This integer becomes the input to the second program (as n).\n\n Therefore, the entire process:\n   Step 1: Read the initial input: n, m and then n integers.\n   Step 2: Run the queue simulation to get the last child (as an integer, say `last_child`).\n   Step 3: Use `last_child` as the `n` in the second program to compute the sum.\n\n But note: the original Java programs are separate. The first reads from stdin and writes to stdout, then the second reads from stdin (which is now the output of the first) and writes to stdout.\n\n We are to write a single Fortran program that:\n   - Only the first part (simulating the first Java program) reads from input (which will be the original input: n, m and the n integers).\n   - Then the second part uses the result from the first part (without reading again) to compute the second part.\n   - Finally, only the last part writes the output (the result of the second program).\n\n However, note: the second Java program expects a single integer (n) as input. In our chain, that integer is the output of the first program.\n\n So the Fortran program structure:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input: two integers (n, m) and then n integers (the candy counts).\n\n   Step 2: Simulate the queue process of the first program to compute the last child (ans1).\n\n   Step 3: Using ans1 as the new n (call it n2 = ans1), compute:\n        ans2 = 0\n        do i = 1, n2\n            k = n2 / i   ! integer division\n            term = i * k * (k+1) / 2\n            ans2 = ans2 + term\n        end do\n\n   Step 4: Print ans2.\n\n Important: We must not output the intermediate result (ans1). The only output is the final result (ans2).\n\n However, note: the first program in the chain reads more than one integer. The input format is:\n\n        n m\n        a1 a2 ... an\n\n But the second program in the chain reads a single integer (which is the output of the first).\n\n So our Fortran program should:\n\n   - Read the initial n and m, and then the list of n integers.\n\n   - Process the queues to get the last child (ans1).\n\n   - Then use that ans1 as the input to the second computation.\n\n   - Finally, write the result of the second computation.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll use an array to simulate the two queues? But note: the queues are circular. We can simulate with two arrays and two pointers? \n   Alternatively, we can use two arrays and update them in a loop until we have processed all.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses two queues: \n        q1: the remaining candies for the child at the front.\n        q2: the index of that child.\n\n   We can simulate with two arrays and two indices (front and rear) or we can use a circular buffer. \n   Alternatively, we can use two arrays and shift the elements? But the queue can grow? Actually, the total number of operations is bounded because each time we subtract m, and the total candy is fixed.\n\n   Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in queue, we can simulate with two arrays and two pointers (head and tail). But note that the queue operations are:\n\n        Initially, we have n elements.\n\n        While the queue is not empty:\n            if the front element <= m:\n                remove it, and record the child index as the current answer.\n            else:\n                remove the front, subtract m, and add it to the back.\n\n   We can use two arrays: one for the candies, one for the indices.\n\n   Let:\n        candy(1) ... candy(n) for initial candies.\n        index(1) ... index(n) for the indices (from 1 to n).\n\n        We'll have:\n            head = 1\n            tail = n\n            count = n   (number of children remaining)\n\n        Then in the loop:\n\n            if candy(head) <= m:\n                ans1 = index(head)\n                head = head + 1\n                count = count - 1\n            else:\n                candy_new = candy(head) - m\n                index_current = index(head)\n                head = head + 1\n                count = count - 1   ... but then we add one element at the tail.\n                tail = tail + 1\n                candy(tail) = candy_new\n                index(tail) = index_current\n                count = count + 1   ? Actually, we remove one and then add one -> count remains the same? \n                But note: we remove one and then add one -> so the count doesn't change in this case.\n\n        However, we don't need to maintain count? We can loop until head > tail? But we are adding at the tail. So we can use:\n\n            while (head <= tail)\n\n   But note: we are removing one element each time. In the case of subtraction we add one at the tail, so the tail moves and the head moves. The queue might wrap? But we are using arrays. We need to allocate enough space.\n\n   How many times can we go through? Each time we subtract m from a candy. The maximum candy value is at most, say, 100 (as in the problem constraints?) but actually we don't know. But note: the problem says the first program: n and m are integers, and the candies are integers.\n\n   We can allocate a big enough array? The total operations: the candy value at the beginning is a_i. The number of times we have to subtract m until it becomes <=0? For one child: ceil(a_i / m). The total operations is the sum of ceil(a_i/m) for all children? \n\n   But note: the queue will have at most (total operations) elements? Actually, we start with n, and each operation that doesn't remove the child adds one. So the maximum queue length is n + (number of non-removal operations) ... but we don't know. Alternatively, we can use a dynamic array? But Fortran arrays are static.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the total operations is bounded by the total candy divided by m? But worst-case, if m=1, then we do sum_i a_i operations. So we must allocate an array of size (head + total_operations) ... but we don't know total_operations in advance.\n\n   However, the problem constraints? The first program is from codeforces problem 450A. Constraints: \n        n, m: 1 <= n, m <= 100\n        each a_i: 1 <= a_i <= 100\n\n   So the maximum operations per child: ceil(100/1)=100, and total operations <= 100 * 100 = 10000.\n\n   We can allocate arrays of size 10000 for candy and index.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        integer, parameter :: max_size = 10000\n        integer :: candy(max_size), index_arr(max_size)   ! avoid using index as name? use child_index?\n        integer :: head, tail, n, m, i, ans1\n\n        read *, n, m\n        head = 1\n        tail = n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read *, candy(i)\n            index_arr(i) = i\n        end do\n\n        ans1 = 0   ! we will update in the loop\n\n        do while (head <= tail)\n            if (candy(head) <= m) then\n                ans1 = index_arr(head)\n                head = head + 1\n            else\n                ! subtract m and put at the tail\n                candy(tail+1) = candy(head) - m\n                index_arr(tail+1) = index_arr(head)\n                tail = tail + 1\n                head = head + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   But note: when we remove the last child, we set ans1 to that child. Then the loop ends.\n\n   Then we have ans1 (the last child).\n\n   Step 3: Now use ans1 as the input n for the second program.\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans2, n2, i, k, term   ! because the second program uses long and the numbers might be big.\n\n        n2 = ans1   ! but note: ans1 is integer, but the second program uses integer that might be large? \n        ! The second program: n is the input. In the chain, n2 = ans1. Since the first program's output is at most n (the number of children) and n<=100, then n2<=100. \n        ! But wait: the first program outputs the index of the last child, which is between 1 and n (<=100). So n2 is small.\n\n        ans2 = 0\n        do i = 1, n2\n            k = n2 / i   ! integer division\n            term = i * k * (k+1) / 2\n            ans2 = ans2 + term\n        end do\n\n        print *, ans2\n\n   However, note: the second program in Java uses long. We must use integer(kind=8) for ans2, n2, i, k, term to avoid overflow? \n        Since n2 is at most 100, then k is at most 100, and term = i * k * (k+1) / 2: maximum i=100, k=100 -> 100*100*101/2 = 505000 -> which fits in 32-bit? \n        But the problem in the second program: the input n can be up to 10^7? But in our chain, n2 is only up to 100. So it's safe.\n\n   But wait: the chain: the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is the last child index (<=100). So we are safe.\n\n   However, what if the constraints of the first program are changed? The problem says the original constraints: n, m <= 100, so the last child index is at most 100.\n\n   So we can proceed.\n\n   Let's write the entire program.\n\n   Important: We must use the same behavior. The first program: the last child that gets <=m candies is recorded. Our simulation with arrays should be equivalent.\n\n   But note: in the Java program, the queue is processed in order. Our array simulation with head and tail is a FIFO queue.\n\n   Code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! For the first program\n        integer :: n, m, i, head, tail, ans1\n        integer, dimension(10000) :: candy, child_index   ! max_size=10000\n        ! For the second program\n        integer(kind=8) :: n2, ans2, k_val, term, j   ! j for the loop index\n\n        ! Read the initial input: n and m\n        read *, n, m\n\n        ! Read the n integers for the candy\n        head = 1\n        tail = n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read *, candy(i)\n            child_index(i) = i\n        end do\n\n        ! If n is zero? but n>=1 per constraints.\n        ans1 = 0\n        do while (head <= tail)\n            if (candy(head) <= m) then\n                ! This child gets all they want and leaves\n                ans1 = child_index(head)\n                head = head + 1\n            else\n                ! Subtract m and put at the tail\n                candy(tail+1) = candy(head) - m\n                child_index(tail+1) = child_index(head)\n                tail = tail + 1\n                head = head + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Now ans1 is the result of the first program.\n\n        ! Now set n2 to ans1 (convert to 8-byte integer if needed, but ans1 is small)\n        n2 = ans1\n\n        ! Compute the second program's formula\n        ans2 = 0\n        do j = 1, n2\n            k_val = n2 / j   ! integer division (floor)\n            term = j * k_val * (k_val + 1) / 2\n            ans2 = ans2 + term\n        end do\n\n        ! Print the final result\n        print *, ans2\n\n        end program combined\n\n   However, note: in the second program, the formula uses integer arithmetic. The division by 2: in the Java code, it is integer division. \n        But note: k_val*(k_val+1) is always even? So integer division by 2 is exact.\n\n   But in Fortran, if we use integer(kind=8) for term, then the division by 2 is integer division? Yes, because all are integers.\n\n   Let me test with small numbers: j=1, k_val = n2 (which is ans1). For example, if n2=1: term=1*1*2/2=1 -> correct.\n\n   This should be equivalent.\n\n   But note: the first program's constraints (n, m<=100) and the candy values <=100, so the array size 10000 is safe.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can compute the maximum operations: worst-case m=1, then each candy value a_i requires a_i operations. The total operations is sum_i a_i <= 100*100 = 10000. So our array size 10000 is exactly the maximum.\n\n   But note: we start with n (<=100) and then we add (total operations - n) because each operation that doesn't remove a child adds one element. The total operations (loop iterations) is the total candy divided by m? Actually, it's the total number of times we subtract m until all are <=0? But we subtract until the remaining is <=m. Actually, the total operations is the total number of times we subtract m? And that is the sum of ceil(a_i/m). \n\n        For one child: ceil(a_i/m) times. Then the total operations is sum_i ceil(a_i/m) <= 100 * ceil(100/1) = 10000.\n\n   And the queue length: initially n, then we add one for each operation that doesn't remove the child. The number of operations that don't remove the child is total_operations - n (because we remove n children). So the maximum queue length is n + (total_operations - n) = total_operations. And total_operations <= 10000.\n\n   Therefore, our array of size 10000 is sufficient.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must use integer(kind=8) for the second part to match the Java long? Even though the numbers are small, we do it as per specification.\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain is atcoder_ABC172_D. The constraints for that problem say n can be up to 10^7? However, in our chain the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is at most 100. So we are safe.\n\n   Final code:"
