Then ans1=0. then the second program: string \"0\", then output 0. But the first program: n=1 -> output 0? then the second program: input \"0\", then output 0? correct. Also, n=0? The first program: read n=0. Then the loop: sqrt(0)=0 -> loop from i=2 to 0? then no iteration. Then if temp>1: temp=0 -> no? then ans1=0. Then the second program: output 0?

We can declare MOD as integer*8. Let me change:\n\n        integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n\n  Or we can use:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007 But if we assign to integer*8, then it's fine. Actually, we'll declare:\n\n        integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n  Then:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD )\n\n  This is safe.

So output 0. But the first program output 1, then the second program: input \"1\", then 1 mod13=1 -> output 0. Correct. Test with n=5: \n        Factorization: 5 is prime -> so in the loop: i=2 to sqrt(5)=2 -> i=2: 5 mod2 ! =0 -> skip. Then i=3: 3>2? -> break. Then temp=5>1 -> ans1=1. Then the second program: string \"1\", output 0. But wait, the first program for n=5: \n            i=2: 5%2 ! =0 -> skip. then i=3: 3>sqrt(5)=2 -> break. then temp=5>1 -> ans1=1. Then the second program: output 0. The original chain: first program outputs 1, then second program outputs 0? Correct. Test with n=1000000000000 (10^12): The first program: \n            factors: 2^12 * 5^12? For 2: exponent=12 -> \n                j=1: 12-1=11 -> op=1\n                j=2: 11-2=9 -> op=2\n                j=3: 9-3=6 -> op=3\n                j=4: 6-4=2 -> op=4\n                j=5: 2-5<0 -> break -> 4 operations for 2. For 5: exponent=12 -> same: 4 operations. Then temp=1 -> no extra op -> ans1=8. Then the second program: string \"8\" -> \n            k=0: d=8, base=1 -> new_r = (1*8+0)=8 -> dp_new(8)=1\n            base=10 mod13=10\n            then output dp_old(5)=0? -> output 0. But 8 mod13=8 -> not 5 -> output 0. Correct. Test with n=1: \n        ans1=0 -> string \"0\" -> \n            k=0: d=0, base=1 -> new_r = (0+0)=0 -> dp_new(0)=1\n            then output 0 -> state0, then state5=0 -> output0. Test with n=6: \n        6 = 2*3\n        For 2: exponent=1 -> j=1: 1-1=0 -> op=1, then j=2: 0-2<0 -> break -> one op. For 3: exponent=1 -> one op. Then temp=1 -> ans1=2. Then string \"2\": \n            k=0: d=2, base=1 -> new_r= (1*2+0)=2 -> dp_new(2)=1\n            output 0. But 2 mod13=2 -> output0. Now, test with a number that gives ans1=5: We need a number such that the operations count is 5. Example: \n          Factor 2: exponent=5 -> \n                j=1: 5-1=4 -> op1\n                j=2: 4-2=2 -> op2\n                j=3: 2-3<0 -> break -> 2 operations? Then factor 3: exponent=3 -> \n                j=1: 3-1=2 -> op3\n                j=2: 2-2=0 -> op4\n                j=3: 0-3<0 -> break -> 2 operations -> total 4. How about factor 2: exponent=3 -> 1+2 -> 2 operations, then factor 3: exponent=3 -> 2 operations -> total 4.\n\n          How about factor 2: exponent=4 -> \n                j=1: 4-1=3 -> op1\n                j=2: 3-2=1 -> op2\n                j=3: 1-3<0 -> break -> 2 operations. Then factor 3: exponent=1 -> op3\n          Then factor 5: exponent=1 -> op4\n          Then factor 7: exponent=1 -> op5? because after the loop, if temp>1 then we do one more? But after the loop, we have temp = 3*5*7? Then we do one op for each?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first program is the input to the second program.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC169_D):\n  - Reads a long integer `n`.\n  - Computes the number of operations to break down the prime factors in a specific way.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC135_D):\n  - Reads a string (which is the output of the first program, but note: the first program outputs an integer, so the second program expects a string of digits? However, looking at the second program, it actually reads a string that may contain digits and '?').\n\nBut note: the first program outputs an integer (the answer) and then the second program expects a string. So the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input string for the second program.\n\nHowever, the second program is designed for a problem that involves processing a string with digits and question marks (like a pattern for a number). But the output of the first program is just an integer (without any question marks). Therefore, the second program will read a string of digits.\n\nBut wait: the second program's input is the output of the first. The first program outputs a single integer (so a string of digits). The second program then processes that string of digits as if it were a string that might have '?' but in this case it doesn't. So the second program will work because the string is composed entirely of digits.\n\nBut note: the second program processes the string from right to left. The modulus base is 13. It computes the number of ways the string (if there were '?' we would consider all digits) but here there are no '?'. So it effectively computes the remainder modulo 13 of the number? But then it outputs dp[length-1][5] meaning the number of ways that the entire number mod 13 is 5? But since there are no '?' there is exactly one way? Then why the dynamic programming? Actually, the second program is designed to handle strings that might contain '?' by replacing each '?' with a digit (0-9). But in our chain, the input to the second program is a fixed integer (with no '?'). Therefore, the second program will compute exactly one way and then mod 13 of the number must be 5? Not exactly: the program uses dynamic programming and if there are no '?' then it just does a straightforward computation of the number mod 13? Actually, let me see:\n\nIn the second program:\n  - If the character is not '?', then it uses the fixed digit.\n\nSo for a string without '?', the program will compute the remainder mod 13 of the entire number? Then it will output 1 if the remainder is 5? But note: the state dp[i][r] is the number of ways for the suffix processed so far (i+1 digits) to have remainder r. Since there are no '?', there is exactly one way. So the program will output 1 if the entire number mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise? But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nActually, the second program is for the problem: \n  \"Given a string S consisting of digits and '?'. We replace each '?' with a digit. How many ways are there to replace the '?' such that the resulting number (in decimal) is divisible by 13? And the answer mod 1e9+7.\"\n\nBut note: the problem says the number may be very big, so we do mod 13. The answer is the number of ways that the entire number mod 13 equals 0? But in the code, the last state is [5]? Actually, the problem asks for mod 5? Let me check the problem: the sample is \"??2??5\" -> 0 mod 13? Actually, the problem says \"modulo 13, remainder 5\".\n\nLooking at the code: \n  System.out.println(dp[dp.length - 1][5]);\n\nSo it's counting the ways to get remainder 5.\n\nBut in our chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first (an integer). There are no '?'. Therefore, the string is fixed. Then the program will compute the remainder of that integer mod 13. Then the state at the end for remainder 5 will be 1 if the integer mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise? But wait, the program does:\n\n  For the first digit (rightmost), base = 1. Then for each digit, base = base * 10 mod 13.\n\nActually, the program processes the string from right to left. For a fixed string, the computation of the remainder mod 13 is deterministic. Therefore, the entire dp[length-1][r] will be 1 for the remainder r of the entire number, and 0 for others.\n\nSo the output of the second program will be 1 if the integer (output of first program) mod 13 equals 5, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be the intended chain? The two programs are independent? Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program outputs an integer (say X). Then the second program reads a string which is the decimal representation of X. Then the second program computes the number of ways that the string (with no '?') would have remainder 5 mod 13. Since there are no '?', there is exactly one way and the remainder is fixed. So the output is 1 if X mod 13 == 5, else 0.\n\nBut note: the second program uses modulo 1e9+7, so 1 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n  Input to the first program: a long integer n.\n  Output of the chain: 1 if (answer of the first program) mod 13 equals 5, else 0.\n\nHowever, we must note: the first program does not output the number n, but an integer \"answer\" (which is the number of operations).\n\nSo the chain:\n  Step 1: compute \"answer\" from n (as in the first program).\n  Step 2: take the string representation of \"answer\", and run the second program on that string (which has no '?'). The second program then outputs 1 if \"answer\" mod 13 == 5, else 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program should:\n  - Read the initial input (a long integer n).\n  - Compute the value of \"answer\" as in the first Java program.\n  - Then, without any I/O in between, take the string representation of \"answer\" and run the dynamic programming of the second program on that string (which is a string of digits, no '?').\n  - Finally, output the result (either 0 or 1, mod 1e9+7, but note 0 and 1 are within [0, 1e9+7)).\n\nBut note: the second program uses a modulus of 1e9+7. However, since the result is either 0 or 1, we can just output 0 or 1.\n\nHowever, the second program's dynamic programming is designed to handle '?' by summing over possibilities. In our case, we have a fixed string. So we can actually avoid the DP and just compute the integer mod 13? But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\".\n\nWe are required to mimic the exact behavior, so we must implement the dynamic programming as in the second program? Because the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning step-by-step? But note: the second program is written for a string that may have '?'. However, in our chain the string has no '?'. But the code of the second program is fixed. So we must write the Fortran code that does exactly what the second program does, even if it's overkill.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n  1. Read the initial integer n (as a long integer).\n  2. Compute the first program's answer (let's call it `ans1`).\n  3. Convert `ans1` to a string (this string is the input to the second program).\n  4. Process the string from the last character to the first (i.e., reverse the string? Actually, the second program processes from the last character to the first, so we can just reverse the string or process in reverse order). But note: the second program uses the array `cs` and then indexes from the last character: `cs[cs.length - 1 - i]`. So we can create a character array of the string of `ans1` and then process from the last character to the first? Actually, we can process the string from rightmost to leftmost without reversing the string if we traverse from the last character to the first.\n\n  5. Set up a DP array for the string: \n        dp(i, r) for i in [0, len-1] and r in [0,12]\n  6. The base is 1, and then multiplied by 10 mod 13 at each step.\n\n  7. For each position i (from 0 to len-1, where i=0 is the rightmost character):\n        char = the (len-1-i)-th character of the string (if we index the string from 0 to len-1, then the rightmost is at index len-1, then next at len-2, etc.)\n\n        If the char is not '?' (which it won't be, because it's a digit) then we use the digit.\n\n        Then update the dp accordingly.\n\n  8. Finally, output dp(len-1, 5) mod 1e9+7. But note: since the string has no '?', the entire DP will have only one non-zero state? But the DP is built by adding the ways. So we are doing the same computation.\n\nHowever, note: the modulus 1e9+7 is 1000000007. We are doing mod at each step.\n\nBut the second program uses a 2D dp array of dimensions [length][13]. We can do the same in Fortran.\n\nBut note: the second program uses a modulus base that is updated: base = base * 10 % 13.\n\nHow to structure:\n\n  Step 1: Read n (as a long integer, but Fortran has INTEGER*8 for 64-bit integers? Since the first program uses long).\n\n  Step 2: Factorize n and compute the answer (ans1) as in the first program.\n\n  Step 3: Convert ans1 to a string. We need to know the length and the digits.\n\n  Step 4: Set up the DP for the string.\n\n  Step 5: Output the value at dp(length,5) (if we index from 1, then the last state).\n\nBut note: the second program uses 0-indexing and the state for the entire string is at dp[dp.length-1][5]. We'll do the same.\n\nLet's break down:\n\n  First program:\n\n    n: read as a long integer (INTEGER*8 in Fortran)\n\n    sqrt = floor(sqrt(n))\n\n    ans1 = 0\n\n    do i = 2, sqrt\n        count = 0\n        while (mod(n, i) == 0)\n            n = n / i\n            count = count + 1\n        end while\n        j = 1\n        do while (count - j >= 0)\n            count = count - j\n            ans1 = ans1 + 1\n            j = j + 1\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    if (n > 1) ans1 = ans1 + 1\n\n  Then, we have ans1.\n\n  Convert ans1 to a string. We can write the integer to a character string.\n\n  Then, set:\n        len = LEN_TRIM(str)   ? But note: we don't have leading zeros. Actually, we can write the integer without leading zeros.\n\n  Then, we set up a 2D array dp(0:len-1, 0:12)  [if we use 0-indexing for the string positions, but Fortran usually 1-indexed. We can do either, but let's do 1-indexed for the string and for the dp array?]\n\n  However, the second program indexes the string from left to right in the array, but processes from the last character to the first. So:\n\n        Let s = the string of ans1 (without leading zeros, and without any spaces).\n\n        Let L = LEN_TRIM(s)   [if we store in a character variable, we can use the length]\n\n        We need to process from the last character (index L) to the first (index 1). But the second program uses:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                char c = cs[cs.length - 1 - i];   // so for i=0: last char; i=1: second last, etc.\n\n        So we can define:\n\n            do i = 1, L   ! i from 1 to L: i represents the step (0-indexed step i in Java, but here step 1 to L)\n                c = s(L - i + 1)   ! because s(1) is the first char, s(L) is the last. Then for i=1, we want s(L) -> index L; for i=2, s(L-1), etc.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reverse the string? But that might be easier for processing? But the DP in the second program does not require the entire string to be reversed in memory, it just accesses the character at (L - i + 1).\n\n  Alternatively, we can define the string and then process:\n\n        base = 1\n        dp(0,0) = 1   ! but note: in the second program, for i=0 (the first step) and pre=0, then if the character is a digit, then state becomes (base * digit + 0) mod 13.\n\n        Actually, the second program initializes:\n            for i=0:\n                if the char is not '?', then:\n                    next = digit\n                    state = (base * next + pre) mod 13, and then dp[0][state] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre==0?1:0))\n\n                But for the first step (i=0), the pre loop runs for pre in [0,12]. And the base for the first step is 1.\n\n                For pre=0: dp[0][ (1*next + 0) % 13 ] += 1 (because the condition: i>0 is false, so we use (pre==0?1:0) -> 1 if pre==0, else 0). So for pre=0, we add 1 to state (next mod 13). For other pre, we add 0.\n\n        So effectively, for the first digit (rightmost) we set the state to (digit mod 13) to 1.\n\n        Then for the next digit (second last), base = 10 mod 13 = 10. Then for each state from the previous step (which is the state for the last digit) we add to the new state: (10 * current_digit + previous_state) mod 13.\n\n        This is the standard way to compute the mod of a number from left to right? Actually, we are processing from right to left. So the base for the rightmost is 1, then 10, then 100 mod 13, etc.\n\n        The recurrence is:\n\n            state_i = (base_i * digit_i + state_{i-1}) mod 13\n\n        But the DP accumulates all possibilities. In our case, there is only one possibility per step.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let dp(i, r) = the number of ways for the suffix of the first i+1 digits (from the right) to have remainder r.\n\n            Then for the next digit (at position i, which is the next to the left) we do:\n\n                For each remainder r (from the previous step) and for each digit d (if there were choices) but here only one digit d:\n\n                    new_r = (base * d + r) mod 13\n\n                    dp(i, new_r) += dp(i-1, r)\n\n            And base is updated: base = (base * 10) mod 13.\n\n        Since we have no choices, we can also do without the inner loop for digits? But the code is fixed, so we must do the same.\n\n  Steps for the second part:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        base = 1\n        dp(0:12) for the current step, and we'll have a temporary array for the next step? Or we can do a 2D array of size (0:L, 0:12). Since L is the length of the string of `ans1`, and `ans1` is at most around 50? (because n can be up to 10^12, and the maximum operations is about 40? because 2^40 is around 1e12) so L is at most 2 digits? Actually, the maximum value of ans1:\n\n          The first program: \n            The inner while loop: for each prime factor, we break the exponent e into consecutive integers: j=1,2,... until the remaining is negative. The maximum j such that j*(j+1)/2 <= e? Then the number of operations per prime is about O(sqrt(e)). The total operations is the sum over primes. The maximum exponent for the smallest prime (2) is about 40 (since 2^40 is 1e12). Then the number of operations for 2: j=1: 1, j=2: 2, ... until the sum exceeds 40. The maximum j is about 8 (because 1+2+...+8=36, then 9 would be 45 which is too much). So 8 operations for 2. Then the next prime: the exponent is at most 40? Actually, the total n is 10^12, so the exponents are at most 40. So the total operations is bounded by about 40? Actually, worst-case: n is the product of the first k primes? But the exponents for each prime are small. The total operations is the sum over primes of the maximum j such that j(j+1)/2 <= exponent. For exponent=40, j=8 (since 8*9/2=36, then 40-36=4, then j=9: 4-9 negative -> so we break at j=8 and then one operation for the remaining 4? Actually, the code does:\n\n            for (int j = 1; count - j >= 0; j++) {\n                count -= j;\n                answer++;\n            }\n\n          So for exponent=40: \n            j=1: count=39 -> op=1\n            j=2: count=37 -> op=2\n            ... until j=8: count=40 - 36 = 4 -> op=8, then j=9: 4-9 <0 -> break. Then we have 8 operations.\n\n          Then the remaining 4? The code does not use it? Actually, no: the inner loop breaks when count-j<0. So the 4 is left? Then the next prime? But note: the prime factor is exhausted? Actually, the exponent for that prime is used up? Then we move to the next prime.\n\n          Then at the end, if n>1, we do one more operation.\n\n          So worst-case: the total operations might be around 10? 20? 30? Let's say maximum 100? So the string representation of `ans1` is at most 3 digits.\n\n        Therefore, we can safely use a string of length 20.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n (INTEGER*8)\n\n        Step 2: Compute ans1 (integer) as described.\n\n        Step 3: Convert ans1 to a string. We can use internal file I/O:\n\n                character(len=20) :: str\n                write(str, '(I0)') ans1   ! I0 writes without leading zeros and without spaces\n\n                Then we get the length: L = len_trim(str)\n\n        Step 4: Initialize dp(0:12) for the first step? Actually, we'll do a 2D array for steps from 0 to L-1 (if we do 0-indexed steps) or 1 to L (if 1-indexed). We can do:\n\n                integer, dimension(0:12) :: dp_old, dp_new\n                base = 1\n                dp_old = 0\n                ! For the first step (i=0): we are processing the last character (rightmost)\n\n                But note: the second program uses dp[i] for the step i. We'll do:\n\n                dp(0, :) = 0   ! for step 0 (no digits processed) we have state 0 with count 1? Actually, the second program for the first step uses pre=0 and then adds 1 to the state of (base * digit) mod 13. But for the first step, the base is 1. And the digit is the last digit.\n\n                Actually, the second program for the first step:\n\n                    if (i==0) then for pre=0, we add 1 to state (base * digit) mod 13.\n\n                So we can set:\n\n                    dp_old(0) = 1   ! at step -1 (before any digit) we have remainder 0 with count 1.\n\n                Then for each step i from 0 to L-1 (0-indexed, for the i-th digit from the right):\n\n                    dp_new = 0\n                    c = str(L - i : L - i)   ! the (L-i)-th character? Actually, the string is stored from index 1 to L. The last character is at L, then the next at L-1, etc.\n\n                    So for step i, we take the character at position L - i.\n\n                    But note: i=0 -> last char (index L); i=1 -> index L-1; ... i = L-1 -> index 1.\n\n                    Then, if the character is a digit (which it is) then:\n\n                        d = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n                    Then for each remainder r in [0,12]:\n\n                        if (dp_old(r) > 0) then\n                            new_r = mod(base * d + r, 13)\n                            dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(r), MOD)\n                        end if\n\n                    But wait: the second program does not condition on the previous state being non-zero? It loops all pre from 0 to 12 and adds. So we can do:\n\n                        for r = 0,12\n                            new_r = mod(base * d + r, 13)\n                            dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(r), MOD)\n\n                    Then set base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n                    Then set dp_old = dp_new for the next step.\n\n                After processing all L digits, the result is dp_old(5)\n\n        However, note: the second program does:\n\n            for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n                dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... dp_old[pre] ...\n\n            This is equivalent to:\n\n                new_r = (base * digit + pre) mod 13\n\n            And we add the count from pre to new_r.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            dp_new = 0\n            do pre = 0, 12\n                new_r = mod(base * d + pre, 13)\n                dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD)\n            end do\n\n        Then update base and set dp_old = dp_new for the next step.\n\n        Step 5: Output dp_old(5)   (because after processing all digits, we have the entire string and we want the state 5).\n\n  But note: the second program does:\n\n        base = base * 10 % 13\n\n        at the end of the loop.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        Read n (INTEGER*8)\n\n        ... compute ans1 ...\n\n        Convert ans1 to string: write to a character variable.\n\n        L = len_trim(str)\n\n        dp_old(0) = 1   ! state 0 has count 1 at step 0 (no digit processed)\n        base = 1\n\n        do i = 0, L-1   ! i from 0 to L-1 (0-indexed step)\n            ! get the character at position L - i (because the string is stored from 1 to L, and we want the last char first)\n            c = str(L-i:L-i)\n            d = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n            dp_new = 0   ! zero the new state\n\n            do pre = 0, 12\n                new_r = mod(base * d + pre, 13)\n                dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD)\n            end do\n\n            ! But wait: the above inner loop does not account for the entire DP? Actually, the second program does:\n\n            !   for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n            !       dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... dp_old[pre] ...\n            !   }\n\n            ! However, note: the second program does not break the string by one digit at a time? Actually, the above inner loop is for one digit? And then we update the entire dp_new for the next state.\n\n            ! But the above inner loop does not consider multiple possibilities? In our case, we have only one digit. But the second program, if there were '?', would do a loop over next from 0 to 9. But we have fixed next=d.\n\n            ! So the above inner loop is exactly what we do for a fixed digit.\n\n            ! Then update base and dp_old:\n\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n            dp_old = dp_new\n        end do\n\n        Then output dp_old(5)\n\n  However, note: the second program does the update for one digit and then moves to the next. We are doing the same.\n\n  But there is an issue: the second program for a fixed digit does:\n\n        for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n            dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0));\n        }\n\n  We did:\n\n        We set dp_old(0)=1 at the beginning (for step -1). Then for the first digit (i=0) we do:\n\n            pre from 0 to 12: \n                if pre==0: then we add 1 to state (base*d + 0) mod 13.\n                for pre>=1: we add 0.\n\n        This matches: (i>0? ... : (pre==0?1:0)) for i=0.\n\n        For i>=1, we use dp_old from the previous step (which is dp[i-1] in the Java program).\n\n  Therefore, the above algorithm is correct.\n\n  But note: the second program uses the entire dp array from the previous step. We are doing the same.\n\n  However, the above inner loop for pre from 0 to 12 is for one digit. Then we update the base and move to the next digit.\n\n  Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the string we have for `ans1` might have leading zeros? Actually, no: because `ans1` is a nonnegative integer. We write without leading zeros.\n\n  Example: if ans1=0, then the string is \"0\". Then:\n\n        L=1\n        i=0: c='0', d=0.\n        base=1\n        Then for pre=0: new_r = (1*0+0)=0 mod13 -> dp_new(0)=1\n        Then base = 1*10 mod13=10\n        Then dp_old becomes [1,0,0,...,0] (only index0=1)\n\n        Then output dp_old(5)=0.\n\n  But 0 mod13 is 0, so we output 0.\n\n  If ans1=5, then string=\"5\", then:\n\n        i=0: d=5, base=1 -> new_r = (1*5+0)=5 -> dp_new(5)=1\n        Then base = 10 mod13=10\n        Then output dp_new(5)=1.\n\n  But note: the entire number is 5, so 5 mod13=5 -> we output 1.\n\n  If ans1=10, then string=\"10\", then:\n\n        Step0 (i=0): last char is '0'\n            d=0, base=1 -> for pre in [0,12]: \n                new_r = (1*0 + pre) mod13 = pre\n                dp_new(pre) = dp_old(pre)   [which is 1 for pre=0, and 0 otherwise] -> so dp_new(0)=1, others 0.\n            base = 10 mod13=10\n\n        Step1 (i=1): char is '1'\n            d=1, base=10\n            for pre from 0 to 12:\n                new_r = (10 * 1 + pre) mod13 = (10+pre) mod13\n                So for pre=0: new_r=10 -> dp_new(10) += 1\n            Then base = 10*10 mod13=100 mod13=9 (because 100/13=7*13=91, 100-91=9)\n\n            Then output dp_new(5)=0? because we have state 10.\n\n        But 10 mod13 is 10, not 5 -> so output 0.\n\n  So the program is correct.\n\n  Code structure:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer*8 :: n, temp, i, j, count, ans1, sqrt_n\n          character(len=20) :: str\n          integer :: L, base, d, pre, new_r, k, MOD=1000000007\n          integer, dimension(0:12) :: dp_old, dp_new\n          character :: c\n\n          ! Read n\n          read(*,*) n\n\n          ! First program: compute ans1\n          ans1 = 0\n          sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)), kind=8)   ! but note: n is integer*8, sqrt_n should be integer*8? but the Java program uses int for sqrt. So we can use integer*4 for sqrt_n? Since sqrt(n) for n up to 10^12 is about 10^6, which fits in integer*4.\n\n          ! Let me use integer*4 for the loop index and sqrt_n? But n is integer*8, so we need to be careful.\n\n          ! We'll do:\n          sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)), kind=4)   ! or we can use integer*8 for sqrt_n? It doesn't matter as long as we can loop to sqrt_n.\n\n          ! But note: the loop in Java: for (int i=2; i<=sqrt; ...). We'll use i as integer*8? or integer*4? Since sqrt_n is about 10^6, integer*4 is enough.\n\n          ! But we are in Fortran: we can use integer for i, j, count? Let me use integer for i, j, count? But n is integer*8.\n\n          ! So:\n          temp = n   ! we will modify n\n          do i = 2, sqrt_n   ! i is integer*4? But if n is large, sqrt_n might be 10^6, which is acceptable for integer*4.\n\n             count = 0\n             do while (mod(temp, int(i,8)) == 0)\n                 temp = temp / int(i,8)\n                 count = count + 1\n             end do\n\n             j = 1\n             do while (count - j >= 0)\n                 count = count - j\n                 ans1 = ans1 + 1\n                 j = j + 1\n             end do\n\n          end do\n\n          if (temp > 1) ans1 = ans1 + 1\n\n          ! Now, convert ans1 to string\n          write(str, '(I0)') ans1\n          L = len_trim(str)\n\n          ! Now, run the second program on the string str(1:L)\n\n          !

Output the state 5\n          write(*,*) dp_old(5)\n\n        end program combined\n\n  But note: the second program uses modulus 1e9+7 at each addition. We do mod(dp_new(new_r), MOD) at each step.\n\n  However, the modulus operation in Fortran: we can use modulo function? But note: the numbers are not huge because the maximum value in dp_old is at most 10^something? Actually, the maximum value we add is the previous state multiplied by 1 (since no choices) so the entire dp_old is 1 in one state and 0 elsewhere? Then the modulus is just 0 or 1. But we do mod anyway.\n\n  But wait: the second program does:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... and then mod by MOD.\n\n  We are doing the same.\n\n  Let me test with ans1=5: \n        dp_old initially: [1,0,...,0]\n        k=0: d=5, base=1 -> new_r = 1*5+pre: for pre=0 -> 5 -> dp_new(5)=1\n        then base = 10 mod13=10\n        then output dp_new(5)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But note: the second program's state after the first step is stored in dp[0][5]=1. Then the next step (if any) would use that. But for a single digit, we are done.\n\n  Therefore, the code.\n\n  However, note: the first program's loop for i from 2 to sqrt_n: but what if sqrt_n is 0? then the loop does not run. Also, note that if n=0 or 1? \n\n  The first program: \n        if n=1: then the loop from 2 to sqrt(1)=1 -> loop runs i=2 to 1? so no iteration. Then n=1 -> temp=1, so temp>1? no. Then ans1=0.\n        then the second program: string \"0\", then output 0.\n\n  But the first program: n=1 -> output 0? then the second program: input \"0\", then output 0? correct.\n\n  Also, n=0? The first program: read n=0. Then the loop: sqrt(0)=0 -> loop from i=2 to 0? then no iteration. Then if temp>1: temp=0 -> no? then ans1=0. Then the second program: output 0? But the first program for n=0: it would factor? Actually, the factorization: \n        while (n%i==0) -> n=0: mod(0,i)=0 -> then n=0/i=0 -> infinite loop? \n\n  So we must avoid that. The original Java program does not handle n=0? \n\n  Let me see: \n        long n = scanner.nextLong();\n        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);   // for n=0, sqrt=0\n\n        then the loop i from 2 to 0 -> no iteration.\n\n        then if (n>1) -> n=0>1? false -> then output 0.\n\n        But the factorization: n=0, then the while loop condition: (0%i)==0? but the loop condition is only entered for i in [2,0] which is empty. So it outputs 0.\n\n        Then the second program: input \"0\", output 0.\n\n  But the factorization of 0 is undefined. The problem context for the first program (ABC169 D) is for n>=2? The problem says: \"n is a positive integer\", so n>=1.\n\n  So we assume n>=1.\n\n  Therefore, the code.\n\n  However, note: the first program uses a while loop: while (0 == (n % i)) ... but if n becomes 0 in the loop? Then the next mod would be division by zero? \n\n  Example: n=4, i=2: \n        first: 4 mod 2==0 -> n=4/2=2, count=1\n        then 2 mod 2==0 -> n=2/2=1, count=2\n        then 1 mod 2 !=0 -> break.\n\n        Then for j: j=1: count=2 -> 2-1=1 >=0 -> ans1=1, count=1\n                j=2: 1-2=-1<0 -> break.\n\n        Then the next prime: i=3? but 3>sqrt(1)=1 -> break.\n\n        Then n=1 -> no extra operation.\n\n        So ans1=1.\n\n  How about n=0? The problem says positive integer, so we skip.\n\n  But to be safe, we note that in the factorization loop, if temp becomes 1, we break? Actually, we break the inner while, then we break the outer for? and then we check temp>1? which is false.\n\n  But what if temp becomes 0? \n        If n=0 initially, then temp=0. Then in the inner while: mod(0, i) is 0 -> then we do temp = temp/i -> 0. Then we get stuck in the loop? \n\n        We must avoid n=0? But the problem says positive.\n\n  We assume the input n>=1.\n\n  Code:\n\n      We'll use integer*8 for n, temp, and for the loop index i? But the sqrt_n is integer*4? Actually, we can use integer*8 for everything.\n\n      Let me change:\n\n          integer*8 :: i, j, count, ans1, sqrt_n, temp\n\n      But note: count and j are used in the inner loops and j can be large? The maximum j is about 100? So integer*4 is enough. But to avoid type conversion, we can use integer*8 for all.\n\n      However, the exponent count might be up to 40? and j up to 10? so integer*4 is enough. But we'll use integer*8 for consistency.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        read n\n\n        temp = n\n        sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)), kind=8)   ! convert to integer*8\n\n        ans1 = 0\n\n        i = 2\n        do while (i <= sqrt_n)   ! we can use a do loop with i from 2 to sqrt_n? but what if sqrt_n is 0? then the loop is skipped.\n\n          count = 0\n          do while (mod(temp, i) == 0)\n             temp = temp / i\n             count = count + 1\n          end do\n\n          j = 1\n          do while (count >= j)   ! condition: count - j >= 0  -> count>=j\n             count = count - j\n             ans1 = ans1 + 1\n             j = j + 1\n          end do\n\n          i = i + 1\n        end do\n\n        if (temp > 1) ans1 = ans1 + 1\n\n      But note: the original Java program uses a for loop from i=2 to sqrt_n (inclusive). We do the same.\n\n      However, we must note that after the loop, we have to consider the remaining temp. And also, if a factor i is greater than sqrt_n, then we break? Actually, the loop runs i from 2 to sqrt_n. Then after the loop, if temp>1, then temp is prime? and we do one operation.\n\n      Also, note: if i is not prime? But we are iterating i from 2 to sqrt_n, and if i is composite, then temp would have been divided by the prime factors of i already? Actually, the algorithm is: we are iterating by consecutive integers, so we might hit composite numbers. But if a composite number i is encountered, then since we have divided by its prime factors already, mod(temp, i) would not be 0? So it's safe.\n\n      Example: i=4: if temp is divisible by 4, then it must have been divisible by 2 twice already? So after the division by 2, the exponent for 2 is exhausted? Then at i=4, temp is not divisible by 4? So we skip.\n\n      Therefore, the loop only hits primes? Not exactly: it hits every integer, but the composite ones will not divide the current temp. So it's safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n  Let me code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the modulus operation mod(a,b) in Fortran for integer*8: we can use mod(temp, i) and i is integer*8.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer*8 :: n, temp, i, j, count_val, ans1, sqrt_n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        integer :: L, base, d, pre, new_r, k, MOD\n        integer*8, dimension(0:12) :: dp_old, dp_new   ! because MOD is 1e9+7, so we can use integer*4? but to avoid overflow, use integer*8 for dp arrays? The numbers in dp are at most 1e9+7? Actually, they are mod 1e9+7, so integer*4 can hold? But Fortran: integer*4 can hold up to 2e9. So we use integer*4 for the dp arrays? But the MOD is 1000000007, which is about 1e9, so we can use integer*4.\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n\n        read(*,*) n\n\n        temp = n\n        sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)), kind=8)\n\n        ans1 = 0\n        i = 2\n        do while (i <= sqrt_n)\n            count_val = 0\n            do while (mod(temp, i) == 0)\n                temp = temp / i\n                count_val = count_val + 1\n            end do\n\n            j = 1\n            do while (count_val >= j)\n                count_val = count_val - j\n                ans1 = ans1 + 1\n                j = j + 1\n            end do\n\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n\n        if (temp > 1) then\n            ans1 = ans1 + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Convert ans1 to string\n        write(str, '(I0)') ans1\n        L = len_trim(str)\n\n        ! Initialize dp_old: state 0 has 1, others 0.\n        dp_old = 0\n        dp_old(0) = 1\n        base = 1\n\n        do k = 0, L-1\n            ! Extract the (L-k)-th character (1-indexed: the first character is at index1, last at index L)\n            c = str(L-k:L-k)\n            ! Convert char to digit\n            d = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n            dp_new = 0   ! set all to zero\n\n            do pre = 0, 12\n                new_r = mod(base * d + pre, 13)\n                ! Add dp_old(pre) to dp_new(new_r) and mod MOD\n                dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD)\n            end do\n\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n            dp_old = dp_new\n        end do\n\n        write(*,*) dp_old(5)\n\n        end program combined\n\n  But note: the mod function for integers: \n        mod(7,3) returns 1.\n\n  However, the modulus for base: we are doing mod(base * 10, 13) -> base*10 mod13.\n\n  Also, for the dp_new: we are doing mod( ... , MOD) to avoid overflow? The numbers can be big? Actually, in our chain the string has no '?', so the dp states are either 0 or 1? But we do mod anyway.\n\n  But note: the second program does mod at every addition. So we do the same.\n\n  However, the dp arrays are of type integer*8? But we are using integer*4 for the dp arrays? Actually, we declared:\n\n        integer*8, dimension(0:12) :: dp_old, dp_new\n\n  But we set MOD=1000000007 (integer*4). We can use integer*4 for dp arrays? Because the maximum value in any state is at most MOD (1e9) which fits in integer*4? Actually, integer*4 goes up to 2147483647, which is greater than 1e9. So we can use integer*4.\n\n  But to be safe, we'll use integer*8 for the dp arrays? Because the intermediate sum might be large? Actually, the dp_new(new_r) gets added 13 times the previous states? But each previous state is at most MOD? Then the maximum value before mod is 13 * MOD = 13e9, which is less than 2^31 (about 2e9) for integer*4? Wait, 13e9 is 13,000,000,000, which is greater than 2^31 (2,147,483,647). So we must use integer*8 for the dp arrays? Or we do the mod at each addition? \n\n  We do:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod(dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD)\n\n  This mod operation will keep the value below MOD? So we can use integer*4? Because after mod, the value is in [0, MOD-1]. And MOD=1000000007 < 2^31.\n\n  But note: the addition: dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre) might be up to (MOD-1) + (MOD-1) = 2e9, which is less than 2^31? Actually, 2^31 is 2147483647, and 2*(1000000007-1)=2000000012, which is less than 2147483647? So we can do:\n\n        integer*4 :: dp_old(0:12), dp_new(0:12)\n\n        and then:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), int(MOD,4) )\n\n        But we must be cautious: the modulus operation for integer*4: \n\n        We'll declare MOD as integer*4:\n\n        integer*4 :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n        But note: 1000000007 is within integer*4.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use integer*8 for the dp arrays and then mod, then assign to integer*4? But we can just use integer*4 for dp arrays.\n\n  However, to avoid overflow in the intermediate sum, we do:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( int(dp_new(new_r), MOD) + int(dp_old(pre), MOD) , MOD)\n\n        But we are doing mod after the addition? That might cause overflow? \n\n        Instead, we can do:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD )\n\n        This operation: if the current value of dp_new(new_r) is in [0, MOD-1] and dp_old(pre) is in [0, MOD-1], then the sum is in [0, 2*MOD-2]. Then mod(MOD) will bring it back to [0, MOD-1]. And 2*MOD-2 < 2^31? \n\n        MOD=1000000007, then 2*MOD-2=2000000012, which is less than 2147483647? So it's safe for integer*4.\n\n        Therefore, we can use integer*4 for dp arrays.\n\n  But for simplicity, we'll use integer*8 for the entire program? We already used integer*8 for the factorization. The dp arrays are small (13 elements). So we can use integer*8 for dp arrays.\n\n  I'll use:\n\n        integer*8 :: dp_old(0:12), dp_new(0:12)\n\n        and \n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), int(MOD,8) )\n\n        But MOD is integer*4? We can declare MOD as integer*8.\n\n  Let me change:\n\n        integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n\n  Or we can use:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n\n        But if we assign to integer*8, then it's fine.\n\n  Actually, we'll declare:\n\n        integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n  Then:\n\n        dp_new(new_r) = mod( dp_new(new_r) + dp_old(pre), MOD )\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Final code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer*8 :: n, temp, i, j, count_val, ans1, sqrt_n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        integer :: L, base, d, pre, new_r, k\n        integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\n        integer*8, dimension(0:12) :: dp_old, dp_new\n        character :: c\n\n        read(*,*) n\n\n        temp = n\n        if (n == 0) then   ! although the problem says positive, but to be safe?\n            sqrt_n = 0\n        else\n            sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)), kind=8)\n        end if\n\n        ans1 = 0\n        i = 2\n        do while (i <= sqrt_n)\n            count_val = 0\n            do while (mod(temp, i) == 0)\n                temp = temp / i\n                count_val = count_val + 1\n            end do\n\n            j = 1\n            do while (count_val >= j)\n                count_val = count_val - j\n                ans1 = ans1 + 1\n                j = j + 1\n            end do\n\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n\n        if (temp > 1) then\n            ans1 = ans1 + 1\n        end if\n\n        !

Then we do one op for each? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm: \n                for i from 2 to sqrt_n: \n                    for each prime factor, we break the exponent.\n                then if temp>1: then temp is a prime factor with exponent 1 -> one op.\n\n          So if we have three distinct primes beyond sqrt_n? \n\n          Example: n = 2^4 * 3 * 5 * 7, and we choose n so that the sqrt_n is at least 2? Actually, sqrt_n = sqrt(2^4*3*5*7) = sqrt(16*105)=sqrt(1680) ~ 40, so we iterate i=2 to 40.\n\n          For i=2: exponent=4 -> 2 operations.\n          For i=3: exponent=1 -> 1 operation (j=1: 1-1=0 -> then j=2: 0-2<0 -> break) -> so 1 op? \n          For i=4: not prime? but we skip because 4 is composite and we've divided by 2 already? \n          Then i=5: exponent=1 -> 1 op.\n          Then i=7: exponent=1 -> 1 op? but 7>sqrt_n? Actually, the loop goes to sqrt_n=40, so 7 is included? \n          Then temp becomes 1 -> no extra op.\n\n          Total: 2+1+1+1 = 5.\n\n          Then we need n = 2^4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 16 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 1680.\n\n          Then ans1=5.\n\n          Then the second program: input \"5\", output 1.\n\n          So the program should output 1.\n\n          Now, run with n=1680.\n\n          Factorization:\n            i=2: 1680/2=840, /2=420, /2=210, /2=105 -> count=4 -> then j: 4->4-1=3, then 3-2=1, then 1-3<0 -> so j=1 and j=2 -> 2 operations.\n            i=3: 105/3=35 -> count=1 -> j=1: 1-1=0 -> 1 op.\n            i=4: skip (composite, 105 not divisible by 4)\n            i=5: 35/5=7 -> count=1 -> 1 op.\n            i=7: 7/7=1 -> 1 op.\n            Then temp=1 -> done.\n\n            Total: 2+1+1+1=5.\n\n          Then the second program: string \"5\" -> \n            k=0: d=5, base=1 -> new_r = 5 -> state5=1 -> then output 1.\n\n          Therefore, the program outputs 1.\n\n  Therefore, we write the code as above.\n\n  Note: the base for the modulus 13 is updated at the end of the loop for the next step. But the next step uses the new base.\n\n  We'll run the code for n=1680 and check.\n\n  But note: the loop for i: we are doing a do while with i from 2 to sqrt_n. We increment i by 1 each time.\n\n  We'll output the entire Fortran code.\n\n  One more note: the factorization loop: we are iterating i from 2 to sqrt_n, but what about when i is composite? For example, i=4: then 105 mod4 !=0? So we skip. So it's safe.\n\n  Final code:"
