Wait, the original setup is that each Python program's output is the next's input. So the output of File 1 is the input for File 2, and File 2's output is input for File 3. The final output is from File 3.\n\nWait, but the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the C program must process the input through all three steps without I/O in between. So the first part (File1's logic) reads the input, processes it, passes the result to the second part (File2's logic), which processes it and passes to the third part (File3's logic), which then outputs the final result.\n\nSo the C program must read the input once (from stdin), process through all three steps in memory, then output the final result.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\nFile 1: Takes an integer a from input. Outputs 1 if a is 0, else 0. So the output is either 0 or 1. So the first step's output is an integer (0 or 1). That becomes the input for File 2.\n\nWait, but File 2's input is a string (since it uses input() which reads a line, presumably a string). Wait, the first Python program's output is a number (0 or 1). So the input to File 2 would be that number as a string? Because when you print in Python, it outputs a string. So the input to File 2 would be the string \"0\" or \"1\", which is then read as a string (since input() in Python reads the entire line, but in this case, it's just a single character plus a newline? Or maybe the first program's print statement outputs a number followed by a newline. So the second program's input is that number as a string, like \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\".\n\nWait, but in the second Python file, the code is:\n\ns = list(input())\n\nSo input() reads a line (including the newline?), but in the first program, the output is either \"1\" or \"0\" followed by a newline. So the second program's input is that string. So the input to the second program is a single character (0 or 1) plus a newline? Or maybe the first program's print statement outputs the number followed by a newline, so the input to the second program is a string like \"0\\n\" (assuming the first program's output is 0). But when you do list(input()), the input() function in Python reads until the newline and strips the trailing newline by default. Wait, no: input() returns the line without the trailing newline. So if the first program outputs \"0\\n\", then input() in the second program would read \"0\" as the string. So the s variable in the second program is a list of characters of that string. So for example, if the first program outputs 0, then s would be ['0'].\n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\ns = list(input())\n\nSo if the first program's output is \"0\", then input() returns \"0\", so s is ['0'].\n\nThen the second program processes this. Let's see what it does. It counts the even and odd indices (starting at 0). For a single character string (length 1), the even indices (0) would have the first character, and the odd indices (1) would be beyond the string. Wait, the string is of length 1. So s[0::2] is the first character, and s[1::2] is empty. So even counts the first character, odd counts nothing.\n\nThe code then calculates two possibilities: flipping the even positions to 0 and odd to 1, or flipping even to 1 and odd to 0. But for a single character, the first case would be even['0'] (assuming the input is '0') plus odd['1'] (which is 0). So the first option is (even['0'] is 1, so 1 + 0 =1, so len(s) - that is 1-1=0. The second option is even['1'] (0) + odd['0'] (0) \u2192 0, so 1-0=1. The minimum is 0. So the output would be 0. Wait, but let's see:\n\nWait the code in File 2 is:\n\nprint(min(len(s) - (even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"]), len(s) - (even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"]))))\n\nWait, the first term is the number of changes needed if we want even indices to be 0 and odd to be 1. The second term is if even indices are 1 and odd 0. The minimum of those two is printed.\n\nIn the case of input '0', the even positions (index 0) have '0', so even['0'] is 1. The odd positions (index 1) are beyond the string, so odd['1'] is 0. So even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"] is 1. So len(s) is 1, so 1-1=0. The other term is even[\"1\"] (0) + odd[\"0\"] (0) \u2192 0 \u2192 1-0=1. So the min is 0. So the second program's output is 0. Then that becomes the input to the third program.\n\nWait, but the third program expects a string input. The second program's output is 0, so the third program's input is \"0\\n\", so the input is the string \"0\". Let's see what the third program does.\n\nThird program: checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So for input \"0\", the length is 1, so Sa (the set) has size 1, so it prints \"No\".\n\nSo the entire chain's output would be \"No\".\n\nWait, but let's see the steps again. Let me think of an example input. Suppose the original input to the first program is 0. Then first program outputs 1 (since 0 \u2192 1). Wait, no: the first program's code is print(1 if a ==0 else 0). So if a is 0, it outputs 1. So the first program's output is 1. Then the second program's input is \"1\", so s is ['1'].\n\nThen in the second program, even counts '1' (count 1), odd counts nothing. The first term: even['0'] is 0, odd['1'] is 0 \u2192 0+0=0 \u2192 len(s) (1) - 0 \u2192 1. The second term: even['1'] (1) + odd['0'] (0) \u2192 1 \u2192 1-1=0. So the min is 0. So the second program outputs 0. Then the third program's input is \"0\", which is length 1 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe I need to think of a different example where all steps work. Let's see another example. Suppose the first program's input is 1. Then it outputs 0. The second program's input is \"0\", so s is ['0']. Then the second program's output is 0 (same as before). Then third program's input is \"0\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a number. So the third program's input is a string representation of that number. So the third program is expecting a string with exactly two different characters each appearing twice. So unless the second program's output is a two-character string, the third program will output \"No\".\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem's test cases are such that the second program's output is a two-character string? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the flow. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the first program's output is either 0 or 1. So the second program's input is a single character (either '0' or '1'), so the second program's output is a number (the minimum between two values). For example, if the first program outputs 1, then the second program's input is '1', so the second program's output is 0 (as in the example above). Then the third program's input is \"0\", which is a single character, so it outputs \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the actual problem expects that the second program's output is a two-digit number? Like, perhaps the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string is two digits? But in the first program, the output is either 0 or 1, so that's not possible. So perhaps the original code's sequence is not designed to work with the first program's output as input to the second? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the user provided three separate Python files, each of which is supposed to be run in sequence, with each taking the previous's output as input. So the first program's input is the user's input, the second takes first's output, third takes second's output, and the third's output is the final result.\n\nBut in the given code, the first program's code is:\n\ndef solve(tc):\n    a = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n    print(1 if a ==0 else 0)\n\nSo the first program reads an integer a from stdin, then outputs 1 or 0. So the first program's output is a single number (0 or 1). The second program's input is that number as a string (since input() in Python reads the line as a string). So the second program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nThe second program's code is:\n\ns = list(input())\neven = collections.Counter(s[0::2])\nodd = collections.Counter(s[1::2])\nprint( min( ... ) )\n\nSo for input \"0\", s is ['0'], then the even indices (0) have '0', odd indices (1) are beyond the string. So even counts '0' once, odd counts nothing. The calculation for the two options:\n\nFirst option: even['0'] (1) + odd['1'] (0) \u2192 total 1. So len(s) is 1, so 1-1=0. Second option: even['1'] (0) + odd['0'] (0) \u2192 0 \u2192 1-0=1. The minimum is 0. So the second program outputs 0. Then the third program's input is \"0\", which is a single character. The third program checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice. Since the input is \"0\", it has one character, so it outputs \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the problem expects that the first program's input is different. Like, perhaps the first program is part of a different problem, but the user wants to chain all three programs regardless. The user's instruction is to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that behaves the same. So regardless of the input, the C program must process through all three steps.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input (from stdin) into the first step's variables.\n\n2. Process through first step (File1's logic): compute the output (0 or 1).\n\n3. Take that result, pass it to the second step (File2's logic). The second step's input is the string representation of the first's output. So the second step's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nWait, but in C, how do I represent this? The first step's output is an integer (0 or 1). The second step's input is a string, so in the C program, after the first step, I need to convert the integer to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") and then process it as the input for the second step.\n\nThen the second step's output is an integer (the minimum value calculated). Then the third step's input is the string representation of that integer. For example, if the second step outputs 0, then the third step's input is \"0\".\n\nThe third step processes that string and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (the first program's input, which is an integer a).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (0 or 1).\n\n- Convert that to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") to be the input for the second step.\n\n- Process the second step's logic on that string, getting an integer result (the min value).\n\n- Convert that integer to a string (e.g., \"0\" or whatever the second step's output is) to be the input for the third step.\n\n- Process the third step's logic on that string, then output the final result.\n\nSo in C, all steps are done in memory. Let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the first step's code:\n\nFirst step: Read an integer a from stdin. Then compute first_result = (a == 0) ? 1 : 0;\n\nSecond step: Take first_result (0 or 1), convert to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\"). Then process that string as per the second Python code.\n\nThe second step's code in Python:\n\ns = list(input()) \u2192 the input is the string from first step's output. So the string is either \"0\" or \"0\\n\" (if the first program's print added a newline). Wait, in Python, print adds a newline by default. So the first program's print statement outputs \"1\\n\" or \"0\\n\". So the second program's input() would read that as \"1\" or \"0\" (since input() strips the trailing newline). So the string is exactly \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nSo in C, the second step's input is a string of length 1 (either '0' or '1').\n\nThe second step's processing:\n\nWe need to compute even and odd counts. The even indices are 0, 1, etc. For a string of length 1, the even indices (0) have the first character. The odd indices (1) are beyond the string.\n\nSo for the string \"0\":\n\neven_chars: index 0 \u2192 '0'\n\nodd_chars: nothing.\n\nSo even counts '0' once, odd counts nothing.\n\nThe two options:\n\nOption1: even should be '0's and odd '1's. So the number of mismatches is (number of even positions not '0') + (number of odd positions not '1'). Wait, the code in Python is:\n\neven[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"] \u2192 the sum of the counts of '0's in even positions and '1's in odd positions. The total correct characters would be that sum, so the number of changes needed is len(s) - (sum). So for the first option, the desired even characters are '0's, odd '1's. The correct count is even['0'] (1) + odd['1'] (0) \u2192 total 1. So changes needed: 1-1=0? Wait, len(s) is 1, so 1 - (1) \u2192 0. The other option is even['1'] (0) + odd['0'] (0) \u2192 0 \u2192 changes needed 1-0=1. So min is 0.\n\nSo the second step's output is 0.\n\nThird step's input is the string representation of that output, which is \"0\".\n\nThird step's code:\n\nCheck if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nThe input is \"0\", which has length 1 \u2192 so the third step outputs \"No\".\n\nSo the final output is \"No\".\n\nNow, to code this in C.\n\nFirst, the steps in C:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the integer a).\n\n2. Compute first_result = (a ==0) ? 1 :0.\n\n3. Convert first_result to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\").\n\n4. Process the second step's logic on this string.\n\n   a. The string is s_str, which is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n   b. Split into even and odd indices.\n\n   c. Count the characters in even and odd positions.\n\n   d. Compute the two options and take the minimum.\n\n5. The second step's result is an integer (e.g., 0).\n\n6. Convert that to a string (e.g., \"0\").\n\n7. Process the third step's logic on this string.\n\n   a. Check if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.\n\n   b. If yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, let's code each part.\n\nFirst, the first step is straightforward.\n\nSecond step's processing:\n\nWe need to process the string (either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nLet me think of the code for the second step.\n\nThe string is s_str, which is a char array. Let's say it's stored as a char array of length 2 (including null terminator). For example, if first_result is 0, then s_str is \"0\\0\".\n\nThe even indices are 0, 2, 4..., but for length 1, only index 0 is even.\n\nThe odd indices are 1, 3, etc., which are beyond the string.\n\nSo for the even counts:\n\ncount0_even: number of '0's in even indices.\n\ncount1_even: number of '1's in even indices.\n\nSimilarly for odd counts, but since odd indices are beyond, their counts are 0.\n\nWait, perhaps better to loop through the string and count.\n\nAlternatively, for the second step's code in C:\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string, track even and odd positions.\n\nInitialize counts for even and odd.\n\nInitialize even0, even1, odd0, odd1 to 0.\n\nThen for each index i from 0 to len-1:\n\nif i %2 ==0 (even):\n\n   if s[i] == '0', even0 +=1\n\n   else if s[i] == '1', even1 +=1\n\nelse (odd):\n\n   if s[i] == '0', odd0 +=1\n\n   else if s[i] == '1', odd1 +=1\n\nThen compute the two options:\n\noption1 = (even0 + odd1) \u2192 the number of correct characters for the first case (even should be 0, odd 1). The changes needed are total_length - option1.\n\noption2 = (even1 + odd0) \u2192 same for the second case.\n\nThe minimum between (total_length - option1) and (total_length - option2) is the result.\n\nWait, the code in Python is:\n\nmin(len(s) - (even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"]), len(s) - (even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"]))\n\nSo yes, exactly that.\n\nSo in C, the second step's result is the minimum between (len - (even0 + odd1)) and (len - (even1 + odd0)).\n\nThird step's processing:\n\nTake the second step's result (an integer, say x), convert to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"123\" if x is larger). Then check the string.\n\nThe third step's code in Python:\n\nS = input() \u2192 the string is the second step's output as a string.\n\nCheck if the length of the set of characters is exactly 2, and each character occurs exactly twice.\n\nSo in C:\n\nTake the string (from the second step's output as a string), check:\n\n- The length must be 2.\n\n- The two characters must be different.\n\n- Each appears exactly twice.\n\nWait, no. Wait the third program's code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nS = input()\n\nc = Counter(S)\n\nSa = set(list(S))\n\nif len(Sa) !=2 \u2192 print No.\n\nThen for each character in Sa, check if count is 2. If any has count !=2 \u2192 No.\n\nElse Yes.\n\nSo the string must have exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the total length is 4? Wait no, because 2 characters each appearing twice \u2192 length 4. Wait, but in the example where the second step's output is 0, the third step's input is \"0\", which is length 1 \u2192 so it's invalid.\n\nWait, but in the example I thought of earlier, the third step's input is \"0\", which is length 1 \u2192 so the code would print \"No\".\n\nSo in C, the third step's processing:\n\nTake the string (from the second step's output as a string), check:\n\n- The length must be exactly 2? Or 4?\n\nWait, the third program's code requires that the set has exactly two elements, and each occurs exactly twice. So the total length is 4. Because 2 elements each appearing twice \u2192 2*2=4.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif len(Sa) !=2 \u2192 No.\n\nThen for each i in Sa:\n\nif c[i] !=2 \u2192 No.\n\nSo the total length must be 2*2=4.\n\nSo the input string must be of length 4, with exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nWait, but in the example where the second step's output is 0, the third step's input is \"0\", which is length 1 \u2192 so it's invalid, so output is \"No\".\n\nSo in C, the third step's processing:\n\nTake the string (from the second step's output as a string):\n\n- Check its length is 4? Or check the counts.\n\nWait, the code in Python does not check the length directly, but the conditions imply that the length must be 4. Because Sa has two elements, each with count 2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nSo in C:\n\nFirst, get the string (second_step_result_str).\n\nCheck:\n\nif (strlen(second_step_result_str) !=4) \u2192 then output \"No\".\n\nBut perhaps better to process as per the code.\n\nSo steps for third step in C:\n\n1. Get the string (second_step_result_str).\n\n2. Count the frequency of each character.\n\n3. Check if there are exactly two distinct characters.\n\n4. Each must have count 2.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nInitialize an array of counts for each possible character (since it's a string of digits? Or any characters? Well, the second step's output is an integer, so the string is digits. So the characters are '0', '1', etc. But in the example, the second step's output is 0 \u2192 the string is \"0\", which is length 1 \u2192 so the third step outputs \"No\".\n\nSo in code:\n\nchar *third_input = second_step_result_str;\n\nint len = strlen(third_input);\n\nif (len !=4) \u2192 then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the code in Python doesn't check the length, but the conditions would require it. So perhaps better to proceed as per the code.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nWe can count the characters.\n\nInitialize a frequency array for each possible character (since it's a string, perhaps using a hash or array).\n\nAlternatively, since the characters are likely digits, but not necessarily, perhaps use a hash table. But in C, perhaps use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) to count frequencies.\n\nSo:\n\nint freq[256] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    freq[third_input[i]]++;\n\n}\n\nint unique =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (freq[i] >0) unique++;\n\n}\n\nif (unique !=2) \u2192 print \"No\".\n\nElse:\n\nfor each character in the set (those with freq[i]>0):\n\n   if (freq[i] !=2 \u2192 then \"No\".\n\nIf all are 2 \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nNow, putting all together in C.\n\nFirst, the steps:\n\nRead the initial input (the first program's input is an integer a).\n\nThen compute first_result = (a ==0) ? 1 :0.\n\nConvert first_result to a string (char array). Let's say first_str is a char array of size 2 (since max 1 digit plus null).\n\nsprintf(first_str, \"%d\", first_result);\n\nThen process the second step:\n\nThe input to second step is first_str.\n\nWe need to process this string.\n\nInitialize even0, even1, odd0, odd1 to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in first_str (excluding null terminator):\n\nfor (int i=0; i < strlen(first_str); i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) { // even index\n\n        if (first_str[i] == '0') even0++;\n\n        else if (first_str[i] == '1') even1++;\n\n    } else { // odd index\n\n        if (first_str[i] == '0') odd0++;\n\n        else if (first_str[i] == '1') odd1++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the first_str is a single character (since first_result is 0 or 1). So the loop runs once (i=0, even index).\n\nThen compute the two options:\n\nint total = strlen(first_str);\n\nint option1 = even0 + odd1;\n\nint option2 = even1 + odd0;\n\nint min_val = (total - option1) < (total - option2) ? (total - option1) : (total - option2);\n\nThe second step's result is min_val.\n\nConvert that to a string for the third step.\n\nchar second_str[20]; // enough to hold the number.\n\nsprintf(second_str, \"%d\", min_val);\n\nNow process the third step:\n\nTake second_str as input.\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nFirst, count frequencies.\n\nint freq[256] = {0};\n\nint len = strlen(second_str);\n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    freq[second_str[i]]++;\n\n}\n\nint unique =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (freq[i] >0) unique++;\n\n}\n\nif (unique !=2) {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\n// Now check each frequency is 2.\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (freq[i] !=0 && freq[i] !=2) {\n\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\nWait, but what if the length is not 4? For example, if the second step's result is 0 \u2192 second_str is \"0\", length 1 \u2192 unique is 1 \u2192 so first condition fails, output \"No\".\n\nAnother example: if second step's result is 12 \u2192 then the string is \"12\", length 2. The unique characters are '1' and '2', each count 1 \u2192 so frequencies are 1 each. So the second loop would find that frequencies are not 2 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother example: if second step's result is 11 \u2192 string is \"11\", length 2. unique is 1 \u2192 first condition fails \u2192 \"No\".\n\nIf second step's result is 12 \u2192 \"12\" \u2192 unique 2, but each count is 1 \u2192 so second check fails.\n\nIf second step's result is 1122 \u2192 then the string is \"1122\", length 4. unique is 2 (1 and 2), each count 2 \u2192 so output \"Yes\".\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPutting all together in C:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n- Read the initial integer a.\n\n- Compute first_result.\n\n- Convert to string.\n\n- Process second step.\n\n- Convert second result to string.\n\n- Process third step.\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a);\n    int first_result = (a == 0) ? 1 : 0;\n\n    // Convert first_result to string\n    char first_str[2];\n    sprintf(first_str, \"%d\", first_result);\n\n    // Process second step\n    int even0 = 0, even1 = 0, odd0 = 0, odd1 = 0;\n    int len_first = strlen(first_str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len_first; i++) {\n        if (i % 2 == 0) {\n            if (first_str[i] == '0') even0++;\n            else if (first_str[i] == '1') even1++;\n        } else {\n            if (first_str[i] == '0') odd0++;\n            else if (first_str[i] == '1') odd1++;\n        }\n    }\n    int total = len_first;\n    int option1 = even0 + odd1;\n    int option2 = even1 + odd0;\n    int second_result = (total - option1) < (total - option2) ? (total - option1) : (total - option2);\n\n    // Convert second_result to string\n    char second_str[20];\n    sprintf(second_str, \"%d\", second_result);\n\n    // Process third step\n    int freq[256] = {0};\n    int len_second = strlen(second_str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len_second; i++) {\n        freq[second_str[i]]++;\n    }\n    int unique = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (freq[i] > 0) unique++;\n    }\n    if (unique != 2) {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but let's test with the example where the first input is 0:\n\nFirst step: a=0 \u2192 first_result=1 \u2192 first_str is \"1\".\n\nSecond step processing:\n\nlen_first is 1.\n\ni=0 (even):\n\nchar is '1' \u2192 even1 becomes 1.\n\nodd counts remain 0.\n\ntotal is 1.\n\noption1 = even0 (0) + odd1 (0) \u2192 0 \u2192 total - option1 \u2192 1-0=1.\n\noption2 = even1 (1) + odd0 (0) \u2192 1 \u2192 total - option2 \u2192 0.\n\nso second_result is 0.\n\nsecond_str is \"0\".\n\nThird step:\n\nsecond_str is \"0\", length 1.\n\nunique is 1 \u2192 so print \"No\".\n\nWhich matches the expected result.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the first input is such that the second step's result is 12 \u2192 then third step's input is \"12\".\n\nunique is 2 (characters '1' and '2'), each count 1 \u2192 so second check fails \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where second step's result is 1122 \u2192 then the third step's input is \"1122\".\n\nunique is 2 (1 and 2), each count 2 \u2192 output \"Yes\".\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the second step's processing, the code only considers '0' and '1' characters? Because in the original second Python program, the code uses even[\"0\"], even[\"1\"], etc. But in the C code above, I assumed that the input to the second step is a string of '0's and '1's. But in reality, the first step's output is 0 or 1, so the second step's input is a string of either \"0\" or \"1\", so the characters are only 0 or 1. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, but what if the second step's input is a longer string? Like, if the first step's output is a larger number, but according to the first program's code, the first step's output is only 0 or 1. So the second step's input is always a single character (0 or 1). So the code is okay.\n\nThus, the C code should handle all cases correctly."
