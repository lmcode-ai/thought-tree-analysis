  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program. Let me start by understanding each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Python file reads a string from input, processes it, and prints the result. The processing involves building a string by adding characters except when they are 'B', which removes the last character. So the first part's output is the processed string after those operations.\n\nThe second file takes an integer input, calculates (n*2 +1)/3, and prints it. Wait, but in Python, the division here is integer division with //, so it's floor division. So for example, if n is 2, (2*2+1)=5 divided by 3 is 1.666..., so floor is 1. So in C, I need to make sure that division is integer.\n\nThe third file is more complex. It reads an integer k, then in a loop from 1 to k, it calculates t as (t mod k)*10 +7. Each step checks if t mod k is 0. If so, it prints the current i and breaks. If after all iterations, it prints -1. \n\nThe key here is that the output of the first program is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But in the C program, I have to chain them without I/O in between. So the first part's output (the processed string) must be passed to the second part's input (which expects an integer). Wait, but the second program takes an integer input. So the first program's output is a string, which is then parsed as an integer for the second step. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is printed, then the second program reads that as input. So the first program's output is a string, which is then read as the input for the second program. But the second program expects an integer. So the first program's output must be a number, which is then converted to an integer for the second step. \n\nWait, looking at the first Python code: the first program's output is my_str, which is a string of 0s and 1s. So the second program's input is that string, which is read as a number. Wait, but in the second Python code, n is input as an integer. So the first program's output must be a numeric string, like \"101\" which is then read as 5 (if base 2?), but no, in Python input() reads the entire line as a string, then converting to int would be done via int(input()), so the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a string of 0s and 1s. So when the second program reads it, it's expecting that string to be a valid integer. So the first program's output must be a string that represents an integer. So for example, if the first program outputs \"101\", then the second program will read that as 101 (as an integer), then compute (101 *2 +1)/3. \n\nWait, but in the first program, the processing is such that the output is a string of 0s and 1s. So the second program's input is that string, which is then converted to an integer. So the second program's input is the numeric string from the first, so the second program's n is the integer value of that string. \n\nTherefore, in the C program, the first part must process the input string into the 0/1 string, then convert that string to an integer (n) for the second part. Then the second part's calculation is done, and the result is passed to the third part as k. \n\nWait, the third program's input is k, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is (n*2+1)//3. So the third program's input is that number. \n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input string (from stdin), process it as per the first Python file, resulting in a string of 0s and 1s (my_str).\n\n2. Convert that string to an integer n (the second step's input). \n\n3. Compute the second step's result: (n *2 +1)/3 (integer division). \n\n4. Use that result as k for the third step. \n\n5. Then run the third step's logic with that k, and output the final result. \n\nSo the C program must handle all these steps in sequence, without any intermediate I/O. \n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in C.\n\nFirst part: processing the input string.\n\nIn C, we can read the input string using fgets. Then process each character. \n\nInitialize a buffer (my_str) to build the string. Since the input can be up to some size, but in C, we need to manage the buffer. Let's assume the input is not too big. Let's use a dynamic approach or a fixed buffer. Let's say we read the input into a buffer, then process each character.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step can be done as follows:\n\nRead the input string into a char array. Then iterate through each character. For each character c:\n\n- if c is '0' or '1', add to the result string.\n\n- if c is 'B', then remove the last character (if the result string is not empty).\n\nThe result string is built step by step. \n\nWe can use a dynamic array for the result. Let's start with a buffer of some size, say 1, and realloc as needed. Alternatively, since the input can be up to some length, perhaps we can first read the entire input, then process it. \n\nAlternatively, since the input is read once, perhaps we can read it into a buffer, then process each character in a loop. \n\nLet me think of code steps for the first part:\n\nRead the input string into a buffer (char s[100000] or something). \n\nInitialize a result array, say, char my_str[100000], and a length variable len =0.\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\nfor each c in s:\n\n    if c is '0' or '1', append to my_str, increment len.\n\n    else if c is 'B' and len>0, then decrement len (so the last character is removed).\n\n    else ignore.\n\nWait, but the input may have other characters besides 0,1,B, which are just skipped. \n\nSo that's manageable. \n\nOnce the first part is done, the result is the my_str array up to len characters. \n\nThen, the second part: convert this string to an integer n. \n\nWait, the string is made of 0s and 1s, so it's a binary number? Or is it a decimal number? Because in the second Python code, the input is read as an integer. So the string from the first program is treated as a decimal number. For example, if the first program outputs \"101\", then the second program reads that as 101 (the integer). \n\nWait, in Python, input().strip() gives the string, then int() converts it. So leading zeros are allowed, but the value is the numeric value. So the string is treated as a decimal number. \n\nTherefore, the second part's n is the integer value of the my_str string. \n\nSo in C, we can convert the my_str to an integer. But since the string can be very long (if the input is long), we might have an overflow. However, in the original Python code, the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a string of 0s and 1s. So the maximum possible value is when the string is all 1s. For example, if the string is 1000 characters of '1's, that's 10^1000, which is way beyond what can be stored in a 64-bit integer. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in C, if the string is too long, converting to an integer would overflow. But in the original Python code, integers can be arbitrarily large. \n\nWait, but the second program's calculation is (n *2 +1)//3. If n is very large, but in the third program, k is the result of that, which is then used in a loop up to k. So if k is very large, the loop would take too long. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the input to the second program is a valid integer that can fit into a 64-bit integer. Otherwise, the problem would be impossible in C. \n\nAssuming that the input to the second program is manageable, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is a string that can be converted to a 64-bit integer. \n\nTherefore, in C, we can read the string, then parse it as a long long. \n\nSo, after processing the first part, the string is stored in my_str (up to len characters). \n\nThen, we can use strtoull (since it's a string of digits) to convert it to an unsigned long long. \n\nWait, but in C, the string may start with '0's, but strtoull will handle that. \n\nSo:\n\nn = strtoull(my_str, NULL, 10);\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is null-terminated. \n\nWait, in the first part's processing, the my_str array is built with len characters. So after processing, we can set my_str[len] = '\\0', so that it's a proper C string. \n\nThen, the second part's calculation is (n *2 +1)/3. Since in C, integer division is truncating towards zero. \n\nWait, in Python, (n*2 +1)//3 is integer division. For example, if n is 1, (2+1)/3 =1, so okay. If n is 2, (5)/3 is 1.666, so floor division gives 1. \n\nIn C, (n*2 +1)/3 would do integer division, which truncates towards zero. So same as Python's floor division only when the result is positive. Since n is a non-negative integer (as it's a string of 0s and 1s converted to a number), so yes, the division in C would be correct. \n\nSo compute the second part's result as (n *2 +1)/3, which is stored as k. \n\nThen, the third part's code is to compute the minimal i where (7 mod k)*10 +7 mod k, etc. \n\nWait, the third Python code's logic is:\n\nInitialize t=0.\n\nFor i from 1 to k:\n\n    t = (t %k)*10 +7\n\n    if t mod k ==0, then output i and break.\n\nElse, output -1.\n\nWait, let me re-express the loop:\n\nInitially t is 0.\n\nFor each step i:\n\nt becomes (previous t mod k) *10 +7.\n\nWait, but since t is being modded by k each time? Or not?\n\nWait, in the Python code:\n\nt starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each i in 1..k:\n\nt = (t %k) *10 +7\n\nWait, but t mod k is the remainder when t is divided by k. So (t mod k) is between 0 and k-1. Then multiplied by 10, add 7. \n\nSo the new t is ( (t mod k)*10 +7 )\n\nThen check if this new t mod k is 0. \n\nWait, but the check is if t %k ==0. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose k is 7.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ni=1:\n\nt = (0 mod7)*10 +7 \u2192 0*10+7=7 \u2192 7 mod7 is 0 \u2192 so output 1.\n\nSo the code would print 1.\n\nAnother example: k=3.\n\ni=1: t =0*10+7=7 \u2192 mod3 is 1 \u2192 not 0.\n\ni=2: t = (7 mod3 is 1 \u2192 1*10+7=17 \u2192 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: (17 mod3 is 2 \u2192 2*10+7=27 \u2192 mod3 is 0 \u2192 so output 3.\n\nSo the code works as intended.\n\nIn C, the problem is handling large values of k. Since k can be up to (n*2+1)/3, and n can be up to a very large number (if the first program's output is a long string of 1s). But in C, if k is up to 1e18, then t can get very big, but in each step, t is (t mod k)*10 +7. Wait, but (t mod k) is between 0 and k-1. So (t mod k)*10 +7 is at most (k-1)*10 +7 = 10k-3. So when you compute t mod k again, it's ( ( (t mod k)*10 +7 ) mod k ). \n\nWait, but in the code, the t is stored as a variable. However, if k is large, say 1e18, then t can be up to 1e19, which may not fit in a 64-bit integer. \n\nHmm, but in the code, the actual value of t is not needed beyond its mod k. Because the check is whether t mod k is zero. \n\nWait, let's think: \n\nAt each step, t is (previous_t mod k)*10 +7. \n\nBut since previous_t mod k is the remainder, so previous_t = m*k + r, so previous_t mod k is r. \n\nSo the new t is r*10 +7. \n\nThen, the new t mod k is (r*10 +7) mod k. \n\nSo, in fact, we don't need to track the entire t, only its remainder mod k. \n\nWait, that's a crucial insight! Because the next step's t mod k is ( (current_t mod k)*10 +7 ) mod k. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote r_i as the remainder of t after i steps. \n\nInitially, r_0 =0.\n\nAt step i=1:\n\nr_1 = (r_0 *10 +7) mod k \u2192 (0*10+7) modk \u21927 modk.\n\nAt step i=2:\n\nr_2 = (r_1 *10 +7) modk.\n\nAnd so on. \n\nTherefore, instead of tracking t, which can be very large, we can track r_i, which is between 0 and k-1. \n\nThis is a huge optimization. Because even if k is 1e18, r_i can be stored as a 64-bit integer. \n\nTherefore, in the third part's code, we can track r instead of t. \n\nSo the code can be rewritten as:\n\nr =0\n\nfor i from 1 to k:\n\n    r = (r *10 +7) %k \n\n    if r ==0:\n\n        print(i)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(-1)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the calculation was t = (t modk)*10 +7. \n\nWait, the original code's t is (previous_t modk)*10 +7. \n\nSo the new t is exactly (previous_r *10 +7), where previous_r is previous_t modk. \n\nTherefore, the new r_i is (previous_r *10 +7) modk. \n\nSo yes, tracking r_i is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, in C, we can compute r as an integer mod k, which is manageable even for large k. \n\nSo the third part's code can be written with r as a variable of type long long (since k can be up to (n*2+1)/3, which could be up to ( (2^64) *2 +1 ) /3, but even then, mod is manageable). \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe C program steps:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin), process it to build the 0/1 string.\n\n2. Convert that string to a number n (as a long long).\n\n3. Compute k = (n *2 +1)/3.\n\n4. Compute the minimal i where the remainder r becomes 0, using the r approach.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part: processing the input string.\n\nWe can read the input using fgets. Let's assume the input is up to 100000 characters. \n\nBut to be safe, perhaps use dynamic allocation. Alternatively, use a large buffer. Let's use a buffer of 1e5.\n\nchar s[100000];\n\nfgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);\n\nThen process each character in s, building the my_str array. \n\nWe can have a dynamic array for my_str. Let's use a char array with a fixed size, say 100000, since the input can't be longer than that (due to the fgets buffer). \n\nAlternatively, since the input may have a newline, but we can process until the null terminator. \n\nInitialize my_str as a char array of size 100000, and a length variable len=0.\n\nLoop through each character in s:\n\nfor (int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    char c = s[i];\n\n    if (c == '0' || c == '1') {\n\n        my_str[len++] = c;\n\n    } else if (c == 'B' && len >0) {\n\n        len--;\n\n    }\n\n    // else ignore.\n\n}\n\nThen, my_str[len] = '\\0'; \n\nWait, but the my_str array is being filled with the characters, but we need to make sure that it's properly null-terminated. \n\nWait, the code above appends characters to my_str up to len, but the array may not be initialized. So perhaps we should initialize my_str to all zeros first. \n\nAlternatively, after processing, set my_str[len] = '\\0'; \n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo after the loop:\n\nmy_str[len] = '\\0';\n\nNow, the string is stored in my_str. \n\nSecond part: convert to n. \n\nlong long n = strtoull(my_str, NULL, 10);\n\nThird part: compute k = (n *2 +1)/3. \n\nlong long k = (n *2 +1)/3;\n\nFourth part: compute the minimal i. \n\nlong long r =0;\n\nfor (long long i=1; i<=k; i++) {\n\n    r = (r *10 +7) %k;\n\n    if (r ==0) {\n\n        printf(\"%lld\\n\", i);\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"-1\\n\");\n\nWait, but what if k is zero? Because if the second part's calculation gives k=0, then division by zero occurs. \n\nWait, in the second part, n is the numeric value of the first program's output. The first program's output is a string of 0s and 1s. So the minimal possible n is 0 (if the string is \"0\" or empty? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe first program's processing:\n\nThe initial my_str is empty. \n\nIf the input has no 0/1 except after B's, but let's see:\n\nSuppose the input is \"B\", then the first step would have my_str starting as empty, then when processing 'B', since len is 0, it does nothing. So the output is empty string. \n\nBut in the second program, converting an empty string to an integer would be 0. \n\nWait, in Python, if the input is an empty string, then int('') would throw an error. But in the first program, the code is:\n\nprint(my_str)\n\nSo if my_str is empty, it would print an empty line. Then the second program reads that as input, which is an empty string, and converting to int would throw an error. \n\nHmm, but in the problem's setup, perhaps the first program's output is always a non-empty string? Or maybe the problem expects that the first program's output is a valid integer. \n\nAssuming that the first program's output is a valid non-empty string of 0s and 1s, so n is at least 0. \n\nBut when n is 0, then the second part's k would be (0*2+1)/3 = 0.333..., which in integer division is 0. \n\nSo k would be 0, leading to division by zero in the third part's loop. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in the third program's code, the loop runs from 1 to k. If k is zero, then the loop doesn't run, and it prints -1. \n\nBut in the third program's code, the loop is for i in range(1, k+1). So if k is zero, then the range is 1 to 1 (since 0+1=1), but the start is 1 and end is 1, so the loop doesn't execute. \n\nTherefore, in the C code, if k is zero, then the loop won't run, and the code will print -1. \n\nBut in the third part's code, when k is zero, the code would have a division by zero in the calculation of r. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nr = (r *10 +7) %k; \n\nIf k is zero, this is undefined behavior. \n\nTherefore, we need to handle the case when k is zero. \n\nSo in the C code, before entering the loop, check if k is zero. \n\nIf k is zero, then the third program's code would have an error. \n\nBut according to the original Python code, when k is zero, the second program's output is (0*2+1)//3 = 0.333 \u2192 0. So the third program's input is zero, which would cause an error in the loop. \n\nBut in the original Python code, the third program's code would have a loop from 1 to 0, which is not executed, so it would print -1. \n\nTherefore, in the C code, we need to handle k=0 as a special case. \n\nSo in the C code:\n\nif (k ==0) {\n\n    printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nElse proceed with the loop. \n\nTherefore, adding that check. \n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe C code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s[100000];\n    fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);\n\n    char my_str[100000];\n    int len =0;\n    for(int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = s[i];\n        if (c == '0' || c == '1') {\n            my_str[len++] = c;\n        } else if (c == 'B' && len >0) {\n            len--;\n        }\n    }\n    my_str[len] = '\\0';\n\n    long long n;\n    char *endptr;\n    n = strtoull(my_str, &endptr, 10);\n    if (*endptr != '\\0') { // invalid input, but according to problem's setup, it should be valid\n        // handle error, but perhaps just proceed?\n        // assuming the input is valid as per first program's output\n    }\n\n    long long k = (n *2 +1)/3;\n\n    if (k ==0) {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    long long r =0;\n    for (long long i=1; i<=k; i++) {\n        r = (r *10 +7) % k;\n        if (r ==0) {\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", i);\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the my_str is built correctly. \n\nWait, the first part's processing is correct. \n\nWait, in the first part, when processing 'B', it subtracts len by 1. So for example, if the string is \"0B\", then after '0' is added (len=1), then 'B' is processed, so len becomes 0. So the resulting string is empty. \n\nThen, when converting to n, it would be 0. \n\nThen k would be (0*2+1)/3 = 0.333 \u2192 0. \n\nThen the code checks if k is zero, and prints -1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"7\", but wait, no, the first program's output is only 0 and 1. So the string can't have '7's. \n\nWait, the first program's output is a string of 0 and 1. So the second program's n is a number made of 0 and 1 digits, so it's a binary number? No, in decimal. \n\nWait, for example, if the first program outputs \"101\", then n is 101 (decimal). \n\nAnother example: first program outputs \"11\", then n is 11, so k is (22+1)/3 =23/3=7.666 \u2192 7. \n\nThen the third part's code would compute for k=7. \n\nThe loop runs from 1 to 7:\n\ni=1: r = (0*10+7) mod7 \u21927 mod7=0 \u2192 so print 1 and exit. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: k=3. \n\nFirst program's output is \"10\" \u2192 n=10 \u2192 (20+1)/3=7 \u2192 k=7? Wait, no, 21/3 is 7. \n\nWait, 10*2+1 is 21, divided by 3 is 7. So k=7. \n\nWait, but earlier example with k=7 would have i=1. \n\nHmm, but let's see another case where k=3. \n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"5\" \u2192 but that's impossible because the first program only outputs 0 and 1. \n\nWait, the first program's output is only 0 and 1. So n can only be numbers made of 0 and 1 digits. \n\nSo for example, if the first program outputs \"100\", then n=100 \u2192 (200+1)/3 = 201/3=67 \u2192 k=67. \n\nThen the third part's code would compute for k=67. \n\nThe loop would check each i until 67. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. \n\nNow, the code uses a buffer of 100000 for s and my_str. That should be sufficient for most cases. \n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The input line is longer than 100000 characters. But since fgets reads up to the buffer size, it may truncate. But the problem may assume that the input is within that limit. \n\n- The my_str may exceed the buffer size. Since the input is up to 1e5, and the processing can't make it longer than the input (since B can only remove characters), so the my_str's length is at most the input length. So the buffer is okay. \n\n- The conversion with strtoull may have overflow. For example, if the string is very long (like 100000 '1's), then the number is 1e100000, which is way beyond 64 bits. \n\nIn that case, strtoull would return LLONG_MAX and set endptr to somewhere. But in the problem's context, perhaps such cases are not considered, or the third part's code would have k as a very large number, but the loop would run up to k, which is impossible. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code must behave identically. So if the original Python code can handle arbitrarily large numbers, but in C it can't, then this is a problem. \n\nHowever, given that the third part's code can be optimized to track r mod k, which is manageable even for large k, but the loop up to k may not be feasible for very large k. \n\nBut the problem requires that the C code must behave identically. So if the original Python code would loop up to k (which could be 1e18), then the C code would also have to do that, which is impossible. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, but in the third Python code, the loop is for i in range(1, k+1). So if k is 1e18, the loop would take forever. \n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps the test cases are designed such that the loop terminates early. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the minimal i without looping. \n\nWait, the problem in the third part is to find the smallest i such that (7*(10^i -1)/9) mod k ==0. \n\nBecause each step adds a 7 to the end. \n\nThe value after i steps is 7 + 70 + 700 + ... +7*10^{i-1} = 7*(10^i -1)/9. \n\nWe need this to be divisible by k. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal i where 7*(10^i -1)/9 mod k ==0. \n\nWhich can be rephrased as 10^i \u22611 mod (9k / gcd(7,9k)). \n\nBut this might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since in the code, the remainder r is updated as r = (r*10 +7) mod k. \n\nWe can model this as a state machine where each step's r is determined by the previous r. \n\nThe possible remainders are 0 to k-1. \n\nSo the maximum number of steps before a repeat is k steps. \n\nTherefore, the loop can run up to k steps, but for very large k (like 1e18), this is impossible in practice. \n\nHowever, the problem requires that the C code must behave identically to the original Python code. \n\nTherefore, if the Python code can handle large k (even with loops up to k), then the C code must also do so. \n\nBut in practice, for k=1e18, the loop would take way too long. \n\nThis suggests that there's a smarter way to compute the minimal i without looping. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the loop terminates early. \n\nBut given the problem's instruction, I have to write the code as per the original steps. \n\nTherefore, the code as written is correct, but may not handle very large k efficiently. \n\nBut since the problem requires the code to behave identically, even if it's slow, that's the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct. \n\nNow, let me check for possible errors in the code. \n\nIn the first part, the my_str array is declared as char[100000], and the loop processes each character of s. \n\nThe 'B' case correctly reduces the length. \n\nThe null terminator is set properly. \n\nThe conversion to n uses strtoull, which is correct. \n\nThe check for k==0 is important. \n\nThe loop for the third part uses r mod k each time. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother possible issue: when the input to the first program is empty. \n\nSuppose the input is empty, then my_str is empty. \n\nThen, converting to n would be 0 (since strtoull of empty string is 0?), but actually, strtoull of an empty string would return 0 and set endptr to the start, so *endptr is '\\0', so it's okay. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIf my_str is empty (len=0), then my_str is a zero-length string (but the code sets my_str[len] = '\\0', so it's a string with '\\0' at position 0. So the string is empty. \n\nstrtoull on an empty string would return 0, but the endptr would point to the start, so *endptr is '\\0', so it's okay. \n\nThus, n is 0, leading to k= (0*2+1)/3 = 0.333 \u2192 0. \n\nThen the code prints -1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: input \"0B\" \u2192 the first program's output is empty string \u2192 same as above. \n\nAnother case: input \"0B0\" \u2192 processing:\n\nFirst character '0' \u2192 added (len=1). \n\nThen 'B' \u2192 len becomes 0. \n\nThen '0' \u2192 added (len=1). \n\nSo the string is \"0\". \n\nThus n=0 \u2192 k=0 \u2192 output -1. \n\nAnother case: input \"B0\" \u2192 first 'B' does nothing (len was 0). Then '0' added \u2192 len=1. So the string is \"0\". \n\nSame as above. \n\nAnother case: input \"0B1\" \u2192 after '0', then 'B' reduces to 0, then '1' added \u2192 \"1\". \n\nThus n=1 \u2192 k=(2+1)/3=1 \u2192 loop runs from 1 to 1. \n\ni=1: r = (0*10+7) mod1 \u21927 mod1 is 0 \u2192 so output 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
