  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding each file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Python file is a BFS to find the number of connected components in a graph. The input is N and M, followed by M edges. The output is the count of components. The second file takes a string, calculates some modulo stuff with 2019, and outputs a count. The third checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice.\n\nThe challenge is to chain them into one C program. The first file's output (the component count) is the input for the second, which then outputs a number that's the input for the third. The third will output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but how do the outputs connect? Let me see:\n\nThe first program's output is 'ans', which is printed. The second program's input is a string, but the first's output is a number. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the second Python file starts with s, l = (input(), 2019). So the input to the second program is a string, which is the output of the first program. But the first program's output is a number (the count of connected components). So the second program is expecting that number as a string. So the first program's output is a number, which is then read as a string by the second. So in the C program, the first part's output must be the number as a string, which the second part reads as s.\n\nThen the second program's output is a number (r), which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a string input S, which is the number from the second's output. So the second's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the third.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string S. So the second's output is a number, which is printed as a string, so the third reads that as S. So the third will check if that string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. For example, if the second outputs 1212, then the third would see \"1212\" and check if it's two characters each twice. But if the second outputs 1234, then it's four different characters, so \"No\".\n\nSo the C program must process the first part's output as the input for the second, and the second's output as the input for the third. But in C, all the processing must be done in one go, without I/O in the middle. So the first part's output is generated, then passed to the second's processing, then the second's output is passed to the third's processing, and finally the third's output is printed.\n\nTherefore, the C program must read the initial input (for the first part), compute the first part's result (the component count), then use that result as the input for the second part's processing (the modulo 2019 calculation), then take that result and process it through the third part (checking the character counts), and finally print the third's output.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and M, edges, compute the number of connected components (ans).\n2. Convert ans to a string s, then process s through the second part's algorithm to get r.\n3. Convert r to a string, then process through the third part to get \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, translating each part into C functions, ensuring that intermediate steps don't do I/O except first and last.\n\nFirst part: BFS for connected components.\n\nIn C, I need to read N and M, then read M edges. Then build adjacency lists. Then perform BFS for each unvisited node, counting components.\n\nSecond part: The second Python code takes a string s, and computes some modulo 2019. Let me see the code again:\n\ns is the input string. l is 2019. m is an array initialized to [1 followed by 2018 zeros]. a and r start at 0. Then for each character in s reversed (since s[::-1] is reversed), they process each digit. The loop is over i from 0 to len(s)-1, but since it's reversed, the first character is the last digit. The code computes a += int(e)*10^i mod 2019. Then r += m[a%l], then m[a%l] is incremented. The final r is printed.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\ns is the input string (the first program's output as a string). Then s[::-1] reverses the string. So for each character in reversed s, which is the original digits in reverse order. The index i starts at 0 for the first character (the last digit of the original number). So for each digit in the reversed string (so starting from the least significant digit), the code is calculating a cumulative value mod 2019. The pow(10, i, l) is 10^i mod 2019. The a is accumulating (digit * 10^i mod 2019) mod 2019. The m array counts how many times each remainder has occurred before, so that r counts the number of pairs where the same remainder occurs again.\n\nWait, the code's m is initialized as [1,0,0,...0]. Then for each step, a is the current accumulated value mod l. The current a mod l is computed, and r is increased by m[mod], then m[mod] is increased by 1. So the first time a mod is 0, m[0] is 1, so r +=1, then m[0] becomes 2. The next time mod is 0, r +=2, etc. So the total r is the number of pairs of indices where the prefix up to i and j have the same mod, so their difference is divisible by 2019. The code is counting the number of such pairs.\n\nSo in C, the second part needs to take the string s (the first part's output as a string), process it as per the algorithm, and compute r.\n\nThird part: The third program takes the string (the second's output as a string) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the string must be of length 4, with two pairs. For example, \"ABAB\" or \"AABB\".\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\nRead the initial input (for first part), compute ans (the component count). Then convert ans to a string s1. Then process s1 through the second part's algorithm to get r. Then convert r to a string s2. Then process s2 through the third part's logic to get the output.\n\nNow, how to implement each part in C.\n\nFirst part:\n\nImplement BFS for connected components.\n\nWe need to read N and M, then M edges. Each edge is bidirectional, so for each X,Y, add Y to X's adjacency list and X to Y's.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the edges are stored as X and Y (but converted to 0-based by subtracting 1). So in C, the input is read as X, Y, Z? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait the first Python file's code:\n\nfor i in range(M):\n    X, Y, Z = map(lambda x: int(x) -1, input().split())\n    edge[X].append(Y)\n    edge[Y].append(X)\n\nWait, wait, the input for each edge is three numbers? Wait, no, that's a mistake. Wait, in the first Python code, the edges are read as three numbers? Wait, the code says:\n\nfor each of M edges, the input line has three numbers: X, Y, Z? But then the code appends Y to X's edge and X to Y's. Wait, but Z is not used. That's a problem. Wait, looking at the code again:\n\nWait the code says:\n\nX, Y, Z = map(lambda x: int(x) -1, input().split())\n\nWait, but that's three variables, but the edge is stored as X connected to Y. So the third variable Z is not used. That's a bug in the original code. Wait, but maybe the problem expects edges to be given as two numbers (since it's an undirected graph). So perhaps the code has a mistake here. Wait, the problem might have been that the input for each edge is two numbers, but the code is reading three, which is wrong. Wait, but the user provided the code as is, so I have to assume that the code is correct. Wait, perhaps the third variable is a red herring, but in the code, it's not used. So perhaps the code is wrong, but since the user provided it, I have to translate it as is. Wait, but maybe the problem's input for edges is three numbers, but the code is using only X and Y. That's possible. For example, maybe the third is a weight, but the code ignores it. Since the code is given, I have to follow it. So in the code, each edge is read as three numbers, but only X and Y are used. So in the C code, I need to read three numbers for each edge, but only use the first two (after converting to 0-based). So the third number is ignored.\n\nSo in C, for each edge, read three integers, subtract 1 from X and Y, and add edges between X and Y.\n\nNow, the BFS part: the code uses a deque, but in C, we can use a queue implemented with an array or a linked list. Since the maximum N could be up to, say, 1e5? Well, the original code sets recursion limit to 1e9, but in C, recursion is not an issue here. The BFS uses a queue. So in C, we can use a dynamic array for the queue, or a fixed size. Let's see, the maximum N is not specified, but given that the first Python code uses sys.stdin, perhaps N can be up to 1e5 or so. So in C, we can use a queue implemented with an array. Let's use an array for the queue, and track front and rear pointers.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize adjacency lists. Since in C, we can have an array of linked lists. But for simplicity, perhaps use an array of arrays. But in C, dynamic arrays are a bit tricky. Alternatively, since each edge is bidirectional, for each edge, we can add to both adjacency lists. So for each edge X,Y (after converting to 0-based), add Y to edge[X], and X to edge[Y].\n\nWait, but in C, we can represent the adjacency lists as arrays of linked lists. Let's see:\n\nWe can have an array of pointers to linked list nodes. Each node has an integer and a next pointer.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are added in a loop, perhaps pre-allocate space. But that's complicated. Alternatively, use a dynamic array approach with realloc. But that might be error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are read in order, and for each edge, we can append to the adjacency lists. Let's see:\n\nWe can have an array of linked lists. For each node, the adjacency list is a linked list. So for each edge X,Y:\n\nAdd Y to X's list.\n\nAdd X to Y's list.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nstruct Node {\n    int val;\n    struct Node *next;\n};\n\nstruct Node *adj[N]; // assuming N is known. But N is read from input, so we can't have a fixed array. Hmm, problem here.\n\nWait, in C, we can't have a variable-length array unless using C99. So perhaps read N first, then allocate an array of pointers for adj. Let's see:\n\nRead N and M first. Then:\n\nstruct Node **adj = malloc(N * sizeof(struct Node *));\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) adj[i] = NULL;\n\nThen for each edge:\n\nRead X, Y, Z (ignoring Z). Subtract 1 from X and Y.\n\nAdd Y to adj[X]'s list:\n\nstruct Node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\nnew_node->val = Y;\nnew_node->next = adj[X];\nadj[X] = new_node;\n\nWait, but that's prepending. Alternatively, append. But for BFS, the order doesn't matter. So it's okay.\n\nWait, but for each edge, we have to add Y to X's list and X to Y's list. So for each edge, two linked list insertions.\n\nThen, for BFS:\n\nInitialize a visited array of size N, all 0.\n\nInitialize ans =0.\n\nLoop over each node from 0 to N-1:\n\nif not visited, then BFS:\n\nIncrement ans.\n\nInitialize a queue. The queue can be an array with size N, since in the worst case, all nodes are in the queue. So:\n\nint queue[N];\nint front =0, rear=0;\n\nAdd the starting node to the queue.\n\nThen while front <= rear:\n\ncurrent node is queue[front++].\n\nMark as visited.\n\nFor each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\nif not visited, add to queue, mark as visited? Wait, no, need to check before adding.\n\nWait, the standard BFS:\n\nMark current as visited.\n\nFor each neighbor:\n\nif not visited, add to queue and mark as visited? Or mark when added?\n\nWait, in the Python code, the code does:\n\nused[node] = True\n\nthen for nextnode in edge[node], if not used, add to queue.\n\nSo in C, the visited array is marked when dequeued. So the steps are:\n\ncurrent = queue[front++]\n\nmark as visited.\n\nthen for each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\nif not visited, add to queue (rear++), and mark as visited? Or not?\n\nWait, in the Python code, the queue is a deque. The node is dequeued, marked as used. Then for each nextnode in edge[node], if not used, add to queue. So the nextnode is not marked as used until it is dequeued.\n\nTherefore, in C, the visited array is only set when the node is dequeued. So the code would be:\n\ncurrent = queue[front++]\n\nif visited[current], skip (but shouldn't happen). Mark as visited.\n\nthen for each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\nif not visited, add to the end of the queue (queue[rear++] = neighbor).\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the queue is a deque, and they append to the end. So in C, the queue is implemented as a FIFO array. So the code would be:\n\nInitialize front and rear to 0.\n\nAdd the starting node to the queue (queue[rear++] = start; visited[start] = 1? Or not yet?)\n\nWait, in the Python code, the starting node is added to the queue first, then when dequeued, it's marked as used. So in C:\n\nInitially, the starting node is added to the queue, but not marked as visited yet.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIn Python:\n\nqueue.append(i) (the starting node)\n\nthen in the loop:\n\nnode = queue.popleft()\n\nused[node] = True\n\nSo the node is marked as used when dequeued.\n\nTherefore, in C:\n\nInitialize queue[rear++] = start_node.\n\nThen, while front < rear:\n\ncurrent = queue[front++]\n\nif visited[current], skip (but shouldn't happen)\n\nmark as visited.\n\nthen for each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\nif not visited, add to queue (queue[rear++] = neighbor)\n\nWait, but in this case, the neighbor is added to the queue even if not visited, but when it's dequeued, it will be marked as visited.\n\nWait, but in the code, the neighbor is only added to the queue if not visited. Because in the Python code, the nextnode is checked for used before adding to the queue.\n\nAh right! So in the Python code, for each nextnode in edge[node], if not used, then add to queue.\n\nSo in C, for each neighbor in adj[current], we need to check if visited[neighbor] is false. If so, add to queue and mark as visited? Or not?\n\nWait, in the Python code, the check is done before adding to the queue. So in C:\n\nfor each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\nif not visited[neighbor]:\n\n   add to queue (queue[rear++] = neighbor)\n\n   mark as visited? Or not?\n\nWait, in the Python code, the nextnode is added to the queue, but only when not used. Then when it is dequeued, it will be marked as used. So in C, the visited array is only set when the node is dequeued. So the neighbor is added to the queue only if not visited, but the visited is set when dequeued.\n\nWait, but in that case, the neighbor could be added multiple times if not marked as visited when added. So to prevent that, we need to mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue, otherwise, multiple entries could be added for the same node.\n\nWait, the Python code does not mark the nextnode as used when adding to the queue. It only marks when dequeued. So in that case, the same node could be added multiple times to the queue, but when dequeued, it's marked as used, so subsequent entries would be ignored.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the nextnode is added to the queue only if not used. So the check is done before adding. So in C, the code would be:\n\nfor each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n       queue[rear++] = neighbor\n\nSo the visited array is only set when the node is dequeued. So the check is done before adding to the queue. So in C, the code would be:\n\nfor each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n       queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n       visited[neighbor] = 1; // Wait, no, because in Python it's only marked when dequeued.\n\nWait, no. Wait in Python, the nextnode is added to the queue only if not used. But when it is dequeued, it is marked as used. So in C, the visited array is only set when the node is dequeued. So the check for adding to the queue is whether it's not visited. But when you add it to the queue, you don't mark it as visited yet. So that could lead to adding the same node multiple times to the queue. Because another path could reach it before it's dequeued.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the Python code, the check is done before adding to the queue, but the nextnode is only marked as used when dequeued. So in the C code, if we don't mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue, then multiple entries could be added for the same node, leading to redundant processing.\n\nHmm, so to prevent that, the correct approach is to mark the node as visited when adding to the queue. Because otherwise, the same node could be added multiple times from different paths, leading to inefficiency but not incorrectness. However, the BFS would still work, but with more steps.\n\nAlternatively, the standard BFS approach is to mark the node as visited when it is enqueued, to prevent multiple entries.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the way it's written, the nextnode is added to the queue only if not used. But the used array is only set when the node is dequeued. So the nextnode is added to the queue only if not used, but once it's in the queue, it will be marked as used when dequeued. So the check is correct.\n\nBut in C, if we don't mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue, then another path could add it again before it's dequeued. So the code would still work, but the queue could have duplicates. However, the visited array will prevent processing it multiple times.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose node A is dequeued, and has neighbor B. B is not visited, so added to the queue. Then, another node C (also a neighbor of A) is processed, and also has neighbor B. But since B is not visited yet, it would be added again. So B is in the queue twice. But when B is dequeued, it's marked as visited, so the second instance would not process anything. So the code would still work, but with some redundant entries in the queue.\n\nTo avoid that, it's better to mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue. So in C:\n\nfor each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n       visited[neighbor] = 1;\n\n       queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n   }\n\nThis way, the neighbor is marked as visited when added to the queue, so no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the code should mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue.\n\nSo in the Python code, the equivalent would be:\n\nif not used[nextnode]:\n\n   queue.append(nextnode)\n\n   used[nextnode] = True\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the used is set only when dequeued. So the code in Python is different. But in C, to avoid duplicates, we can mark the neighbor as visited when adding to the queue.\n\nTherefore, the C code for BFS would be:\n\nInitialize visited array to 0.\n\nfor each node from 0 to N-1:\n\n   if not visited[node]:\n\n       ans +=1\n\n       front =0, rear=0;\n\n       queue[rear++] = node;\n\n       visited[node] =1;\n\n       while front < rear:\n\n           current = queue[front++];\n\n           for each neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n               if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n                   visited[neighbor] =1;\n\n                   queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n               }\n\nWait, but the queue needs to be an array. Since the maximum N could be up to, say, 1e5, but the problem's constraints aren't given. Let's assume that the maximum N is manageable. Let's use a dynamic array for the queue. Alternatively, since in the first part, the queue can be up to N elements, we can preallocate an array of size N.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint queue[N]; // but N is variable. So need to read N first.\n\nWait, in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99. So if the code is written in C99, then after reading N, we can do:\n\nint N, M;\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\nint queue[N]; // okay in C99.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the first part's code can be written.\n\nSecond part: the second Python code.\n\nThe input is a string s (the first part's output as a string). The code processes this string to compute r.\n\nThe steps:\n\nInitialize l =2019.\n\nm is an array of size l+1 (since mod can be 0 to 2018). m[0] starts at 1, others 0.\n\na starts at 0, r at 0.\n\nThen, iterate over the reversed s (so the first character is the last digit of the original number).\n\nWait, in Python, s[::-1] reverses the string. So for each character in reversed s, which is the original string's characters in reverse order.\n\nFor each i (starting from 0 to len(s)-1):\n\ndigit = int(e) (e is the current character)\n\npow_10_i = pow(10, i, l)\n\na += digit * pow_10_i mod l ?\n\nWait, no, the code does:\n\na += int(e) * pow(10, i, l)\n\nthen mod l is not taken here, but since pow(10, i, l) is mod l, and the multiplication and addition are done mod l?\n\nWait, in Python, the a is accumulating the value mod l implicitly? Or not?\n\nWait, the code does:\n\na += int(e) * pow(10, i, l)\n\nso each term is (digit * (10^i mod l)) mod l ?\n\nWait, but 10^i mod l is computed, then multiplied by digit, then added to a. But since a can be large, but mod l is needed for the next steps.\n\nWait, but the code is accumulating a, but the modulo is only taken when taking a % l.\n\nWait, the code's a is the sum of digit * 10^i for each position (since the reversed string is being processed, so the first digit is the least significant digit). So the total is the number represented by the string s, but the code is computing it mod l (2019) incrementally.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose s is \"123\", then reversed is \"321\".\n\nProcessing each character in reversed s (so first '3', then '2', then '1').\n\nFor i=0 (first character '3'):\n\ndigit =3, pow(10,0,2019)=1 \u2192 3*1 =3 \u2192 a becomes 3.\n\nr += m[3%2019] \u2192 m[3] is 0 (since m was initialized to [1,0,0,...], but wait m is initialized as [1] followed by 2018 zeros. Wait the code says m = [1] + [0]*l \u2192 but l is 2019, so m has length 2019+1? Wait no, in Python, [1] + [0]*l would be 1 followed by l zeros, so total length l+1. But l is 2019, so m has 2020 elements. But mod 2019 can only be 0-2018, so m[2019] is unused. Hmm, perhaps a mistake in the code, but in any case, in C, we can make m as an array of size l (2019), with indices 0 to 2018.\n\nWait, in the Python code, m is initialized as [1] + [0]*l \u2192 so m[0] is 1, m[1] to m[l] are 0. But when taking a%l, the possible values are 0 to l-1. So m's indices up to l-1 are sufficient. So perhaps the code has an off-by-one error, but since the problem is given, we have to follow it.\n\nIn any case, in C, the code can be written as:\n\nl =2019.\n\nm is an array of size l, initialized to 0. Then m[0] =1.\n\nWait, the Python code's m starts with [1], then adds l zeros. So m[0] is 1, m[1] to m[l] are 0. But since the mod is l, the maximum mod is l-1. So m's size should be l, with indices 0 to l-1. So in C, m is an array of size l (2019), initialized to 0, then m[0] =1.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nIn Python:\n\nm = [1] + [0] * l \u2192 the first element is 1, then l elements of 0. So the length is l+1. But when taking a%l, the possible mod is 0 to l-1. So m[0] is correct, but m[l] is 0 and unused. So in C, perhaps we can just use an array of size l, and set m[0] =1, others 0.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint l =2019;\n\nint m[l]; // size 2019.\n\nfor (int i=0; i<l; i++) m[i]=0;\n\nm[0] =1;\n\nThen, a starts at 0, r at 0.\n\nThe string s is the first part's output as a string. So in C, after computing ans (the first part's result), we need to convert it to a string s1. Then process s1 through the second part's algorithm.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\nAfter computing ans (the component count), we need to convert it to a string. Let's see, in C, we can use sprintf to convert the integer to a string.\n\nchar s1[20]; // assuming ans is up to 1e9, which would be 10 digits. So 20 is enough.\n\nsprintf(s1, \"%d\", ans);\n\nThen, process s1 reversed.\n\nWait, the second part's code processes the reversed string. So in C, we can loop from the end of s1 to the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, loop over the string in reverse order.\n\nThe length of s1 is strlen(s1).\n\nSo for i from 0 to len-1:\n\nthe character at position (len-1 -i) is the ith character in the reversed string.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose s is \"123\", then reversed is \"321\".\n\nThe reversed string's first character is s[2], then s[1], then s[0].\n\nSo for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\ncurrent_char = s1[ (len-1) -i ]\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the loop is over s[::-1], which is the reversed string. So the first element is the last character of s.\n\nSo in C, for each character in reversed order:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    char c = s1[ (len-1) -i ];\n\n    digit = c - '0';\n\n    ... compute pow(10, i, l) ...\n\n}\n\nWait, but how to compute pow(10, i, l) mod l efficiently?\n\nIn Python, pow(10, i, l) is straightforward, but in C, we can precompute the powers mod l.\n\nAlternatively, compute it on the fly.\n\nWe can compute pow_10 = 1, then for each step, multiply by 10 mod l.\n\nInitialize pow_10 as 1.\n\nThen for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\npow_10 = (pow_10 * 10) % l;\n\nWait, but the exponent is i. Wait, the first iteration (i=0) corresponds to 10^0 mod l (since the first character is the least significant digit). So for i=0, the exponent is 0 \u2192 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first character in the reversed string is the least significant digit (10^0), the next is 10^1, etc.\n\nSo for each step i (starting at 0), the exponent is i. So the pow_10 can be computed as 10^i mod l.\n\nSo we can track pow_10 as follows:\n\npow_10 starts at 1 (for i=0).\n\nThen for each step, multiply by 10 mod l.\n\nWait, but the first step (i=0) uses 10^0 \u2192 1.\n\nThen for i=1, it's 10^1 mod l \u2192 10.\n\nThen for i=2, 10^2 mod l \u2192 100 mod l, etc.\n\nSo yes, we can track pow_10 as:\n\npow_10 = 1;\n\nfor each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    digit = ... \n\n    term = digit * pow_10;\n\n    a += term;\n\n    a %= l; // Wait, but in Python, a is accumulating, but mod is only taken when taking a%l.\n\nWait, in the Python code, a is not modded, but when taking a%l, it's equivalent to mod l.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\na += int(e) * pow(10, i, l)\n\nso each term is (digit * (10^i mod l)), so the total a is sum over (digit * (10^i mod l)), but since 10^i mod l is already modded, the sum can be modded as we go.\n\nBut in C, to prevent overflow, we can mod a each time.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, a can be very large, but when taking a%l, it's equivalent to mod l. So in C, to avoid overflow, we can compute a modulo l each step.\n\nSo in C:\n\na starts at 0.\n\npow_10 starts at 1.\n\nfor each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    char c = s1[ (len-1) -i ];\n\n    digit = c - '0';\n\n    term = (digit * pow_10) % l;\n\n    a = (a + term) % l;\n\n    pow_10 = (pow_10 * 10) % l;\n\nWait, but the pow_10 is 10^i mod l, so for the next step, it's 10^(i+1) mod l.\n\nWait, but in this way, the pow_10 is correctly computed.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, pow_10 is 1 (10^0 mod l).\n\nAfter first iteration (i=0):\n\npow_10 becomes (1 *10) mod l \u2192 10 mod l \u2192 10^1 mod l.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for the second part would be:\n\nint l =2019;\n\nint m[l];\n\nfor (int i=0; i<l; i++) m[i]=0;\n\nm[0] =1;\n\nint a=0, r=0;\n\nint len = strlen(s1);\n\nint pow_10 =1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    char c = s1[ (len-1) -i ];\n\n    int digit = c - '0';\n\n    int term = (digit * pow_10) % l;\n\n    a = (a + term) % l;\n\n    int mod = a % l;\n\n    r += m[mod];\n\n    m[mod] +=1;\n\n    pow_10 = (pow_10 *10) % l;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the a is not modded until taking mod l. So in C, the a is modded each step, which is okay because (a + term) mod l is the same as (a mod l + term mod l) mod l.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the term is digit * pow(10,i,l), which is (digit * (10^i mod l)), so the term is mod l. So the total a is sum of terms mod l^something, but when modded by l, it's the same as the sum mod l. So the approach in C is correct.\n\nThus, after processing all characters, r is the value to be passed to the third part.\n\nThird part: the third program takes the string (the second's output as a string) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nSo in C, after computing r (the second part's output), we need to convert it to a string s2, then check the conditions.\n\nSo:\n\nchar s2[20]; // assuming r is up to 1e9, but even 1e9 is 9 digits. So 20 is enough.\n\nsprintf(s2, \"%d\", r);\n\nThen, check:\n\nif the length of s2 is not 4 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nElse, count the frequency of each character.\n\nWe can use a frequency array of size 256 (for all possible ASCII characters), or just track the counts.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is s2, which is the string representation of r, which is a number, so it contains only digits. So the characters are 0-9.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nint len2 = strlen(s2);\n\nif (len2 !=4) {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nThen, count the frequency of each character.\n\nWe can use an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9).\n\nint count[10] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n    char c = s2[i];\n\n    count[c - '0']++;\n\n}\n\nThen, check if exactly two distinct digits, each with count 2.\n\nSo:\n\nint distinct =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] >0) {\n\n        distinct++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (distinct !=2) {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nThen, check each of the two non-zero counts are 2.\n\nAlternatively, collect the counts:\n\nint first = -1, second =-1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n        if (first ==-1) first =i;\n\n        else second =i;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (first !=-1 && second !=-1 && (first != second)) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but maybe a better way:\n\nCheck that exactly two of the counts are 2, and the rest are 0.\n\nint two_count =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) two_count++;\n\n    else if (count[i] !=0) {\n\n        two_count = -1; // invalid\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (two_count ==2) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all parts into a single C program.\n\nThe overall steps are:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nRead M edges (each line has three numbers, but only first two are used).\n\nCompute the number of connected components (ans).\n\nConvert ans to string s1.\n\nProcess s1 through the second part's algorithm to get r.\n\nConvert r to string s2.\n\nProcess s2 through third part's checks, output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_N 100000 // assuming N is up to 1e5, but need to see.\n\n// But in C, for variable-length arrays, we can read N first.\n\nint main() {\n\n    // First part: read N, M, edges, compute ans.\n\n    int N, M;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    // Read edges and build adjacency lists.\n\n    // Using linked lists for adjacency lists.\n\n    // Define structure for linked list nodes.\n\n    struct Node {\n        int val;\n        struct Node *next;\n    };\n\n    struct Node **adj = (struct Node **)malloc(N * sizeof(struct Node *));\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) adj[i] = NULL;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<M; i++) {\n\n        int X, Y, Z;\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &X, &Y, &Z);\n\n        X--; Y--; // convert to 0-based.\n\n        // Add Y to adj[X]\n\n        struct Node *new_node = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\n\n        new_node->val = Y;\n\n        new_node->next = adj[X];\n\n        adj[X] = new_node;\n\n        // Add X to adj[Y]\n\n        new_node = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\n\n        new_node->val = X;\n\n        new_node->next = adj[Y];\n\n        adj[Y] = new_node;\n\n    }\n\n    // BFS to count connected components.\n\n    int visited[N]; // assuming C99 for VLA.\n\n    memset(visited, 0, N * sizeof(int));\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (!visited[i]) {\n\n            ans++;\n\n            // BFS queue.\n\n            int queue[N]; // assuming N is manageable.\n\n            int front=0, rear=0;\n\n            queue[rear++] =i;\n\n            visited[i] =1;\n\n            while (front < rear) {\n\n                int current = queue[front++];\n\n                struct Node *temp = adj[current];\n\n                while (temp != NULL) {\n\n                    int neighbor = temp->val;\n\n                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n                        visited[neighbor] =1;\n\n                        queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n                    }\n\n                    temp = temp->next;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Now, ans is computed.

The queue is declared as int queue[N], but N could be up to 1e5, which is okay for stack? Probably not, since stack space is limited. So better to use dynamic allocation for the queue.\n\nAh right! The queue array in the BFS is declared as int queue[N], which for large N (like 1e5) would cause a stack overflow. So need to use dynamic allocation.\n\nSo in the BFS part:\n\nInstead of:\n\nint queue[N];\n\nWe should do:\n\nint *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nThen, after use, free it.\n\nSo modifying the BFS part:\n\n    // BFS to count connected components.\n\n    int visited[N]; // assuming C99 for VLA.\n\n    memset(visited, 0, N * sizeof(int));\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (!visited[i]) {\n\n            ans++;\n\n            // BFS queue.\n\n            int *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int)); // assuming maximum size N.\n\n            int front=0, rear=0;\n\n            queue[rear++] =i;\n\n            visited[i] =1;\n\n            while (front < rear) {\n\n                int current = queue[front++];\n\n                struct Node *temp = adj[current];\n\n                while (temp != NULL) {\n\n                    int neighbor = temp->val;\n\n                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n                        visited[neighbor] =1;\n\n                        queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n                    }\n\n                    temp = temp->next;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            free(queue);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait, but this is inside the loop over i, so for each connected component, we allocate a new queue. That's inefficient, but manageable. Alternatively, allocate a single queue outside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, pre-allocate a single queue of size N before the loop.\n\nSo:\n\nint *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nThen, inside the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n    if (!visited[i]) {\n\n        ans++;\n\n        int front=0, rear=0;\n\n        queue[rear++] =i;\n\n        visited[i] =1;\n\n        while (front < rear) {\n\n            ... \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut then, after each BFS, the queue is overwritten. So this is better.\n\nSo modifying:\n\n    // BFS to count connected components.\n\n    int visited[N]; // assuming C99 for VLA.\n\n    memset(visited, 0, N * sizeof(int));\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    int *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (!visited[i]) {\n\n            ans++;\n\n            int front=0, rear=0;\n\n            queue[rear++] =i;\n\n            visited[i] =1;\n\n            while (front < rear) {\n\n                int current = queue[front++];\n\n                struct Node *temp = adj[current];\n\n                while (temp != NULL) {\n\n                    int neighbor = temp->val;\n\n                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {\n\n                        visited[neighbor] =1;\n\n                        queue[rear++] = neighbor;\n\n                    }\n\n                    temp = temp->next;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    free(queue);\n\nThis way, the queue is allocated once, and reused for each BFS.\n\nThis should fix the stack overflow issue.\n\nAnother thing: the linked list nodes are dynamically allocated, so after processing, we need to free them. The code at the end does that.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSuppose N=3, M=0. Then there are 3 components. So the first part outputs 3. The second part processes \"3\" as s.
