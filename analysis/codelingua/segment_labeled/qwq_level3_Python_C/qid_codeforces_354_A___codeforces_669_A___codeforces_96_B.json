  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding each part and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Python file reads input, processes some calculations, and outputs an answer. The second file takes an input and outputs a value based on a formula. The third file generates a list of numbers and finds the smallest one greater or equal to the input. But since they are executed in sequence, the output of each is the input to the next. Wait, but how exactly do they connect? Let me see the flow.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's answer is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. So the final output is the third's result based on the second's output, which is based on the first's output.\n\nHmm, but the user wants a single C program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input and the last producing output. So the first part's input comes from the user, then the first's output is passed to the second's input, then the second's output to the third's input, and finally the third's output is printed.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input (for the first Python file), process all three steps in sequence, and then print the final result from the third step.\n\nLet me break down each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Python file:\n\nThe first file reads n, L, R, QL, QR from input, then the list W. It computes sum_el as a prefix sum array. Then calculates an initial answer, then loops through each i from 1 to n to compute energy and find the minimum. The final answer is printed.\n\nThe second file takes an integer n (from the first's output) and computes (n * 2 +1)//3. So that's integer division, which in C would be (n *2 +1)/3, but need to handle integer division properly.\n\nThe third file generates all numbers made of 4 and 7 digits, with equal counts of 4 and 7, up to a limit of 1e10. Then it reads an input (from the second's output), finds the smallest number in the list >= that input, and outputs it.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input for the first part (n, L, R, QL, QR and the W array).\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the minimum energy value).\n\n3. Take that answer as the input to the second part, compute (answer *2 +1)/3 (using integer division).\n\n4. Take that result as the input to the third part, which generates the list of 4-7 numbers with equal counts, then find the smallest one >= the second's output.\n\nFinally, output that third part's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nFirst part:\n\nWe need to read n, L, R, QL, QR from stdin. Then read n integers into an array W. Compute the prefix sums. Then compute the initial answer, loop through each i, compute energy, and track the minimum.\n\nSecond part is straightforward: take the first answer, compute (2*ans +1)/3. Since in C, integer division truncates, but the Python uses floor division. Wait, in Python, (n*2 +1)//3 would be equivalent to (n*2 +1 + (3//2))//3? Wait, let me think. For example, if n is 1, (1*2+1)=3, 3//3=1. If n is 2, (5)//3 is 1.666 floored to 1. In C, 5/3 is 1. So same as Python's floor division when the numbers are positive. So yes, the same formula works.\n\nThird part: the third Python file's main function generates all numbers made by appending 4 or 7, keeping track of counts. The numbers must have equal number of 4s and 7s. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the gen function, the condition is if (number >0 and four == seven), then add to the list. So the numbers must have exactly equal counts of 4 and 7 digits. So for example, 47 (counts 1 each), 4477 (2 each), etc. The numbers are generated recursively, starting from 0, then adding 4 or 7 each time, but tracking the counts. The initial call is gen(0,0,0). So the first valid number is when four and seven are equal and number>0. So the first valid is 47 (since starting from 0, adding 4 gives 4 (four=1, seven=0), then adding 7 would make 47 (four=1, seven=1). So that's valid. Similarly, 74 would be another, but the code's order is first adding 4 then 7, so the numbers are generated in order of appending 4 first, then 7. The list is then sorted, so the final list is in numerical order.\n\nThe third part's input is the output from the second part (the (2*ans +1)/3 value). The third part's code reads n (the input), then loops through the list l (sorted) and finds the first element >= n, then outputs that. If none, maybe the last element? Wait, in the code, the loop is for val in l: if val >=n, set ans=val and break. So if all elements are smaller, then ans remains 0? Wait, no, because the initial ans is 0, but the list l is generated with numbers starting from 47 upwards. Wait, but the code's initial ans is 0, but if all elements are less than n, then the loop would not set ans, so it would output 0? But that can't be right. Wait, the code's l is generated with numbers up to 1e10, so for n up to 1e10, there should be elements. But if n is larger than all elements, then the code would not set ans, so it would print 0? Hmm, but the problem might require that the input is within the possible numbers. But in the code, perhaps the problem expects that the input is such that there is a number in the list >= it. So in the C code, we need to handle that.\n\nNow, the C code must generate all such numbers, store them in a sorted array, then search for the first element >= the input value.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to implement the third part in C.\n\nThe third part's generation is a recursive function. But in C, recursion might hit stack limits for large numbers. However, the limit is 1e10, so the maximum number of digits is 10. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum number of digits for a number with equal 4 and 7 counts would be even digits. The maximum possible is 10 digits (since 1e10 is 10^10, so 10 digits). So the maximum depth of recursion would be 10 steps (since each step adds a digit). So recursion is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can implement it iteratively, but recursion is easier here.\n\nSo in C, the gen function can be a recursive function that builds the list. But in C, dynamic arrays are needed. Since the list can be large, but the maximum possible numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts up to 1e10:\n\nLet me think how many such numbers there are. For each even number of digits 2k, the number of such numbers is C(2k, k). The maximum 2k is 10 digits (since 1e10 is 10 digits, so 10 digits would be 5 and 5, so 2k=10, k=5. So the total numbers would be sum_{k=1 to 5} C(2k, k). Let's compute:\n\nFor k=1 (2 digits): C(2,1)=2 (47,74)\n\nk=2 (4 digits): C(4,2)=6 \u2192 6 numbers.\n\nk=3 (6 digits): C(6,3)=20 \u2192 20.\n\nk=4 (8 digits): C(8,4)=70 \u2192 70.\n\nk=5 (10 digits): C(10,5)=252 \u2192 252.\n\nTotal is 2+6+20+70+252 = 350. So the list l has 350 elements. So manageable.\n\nThus, in C, we can pre-allocate an array of size 350, and track the count.\n\nSo steps for the third part in C:\n\n- Generate all numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts, up to 1e10.\n\n- Sort them.\n\n- Read the input (from second part's output).\n\n- Find the first element in the sorted array >= input, output it.\n\nNow, putting all together in C:\n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read the first part's input (n, L, R, QL, QR, then the W array).\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the minimum energy).\n\n3. Compute the second part's value ( (2*ans +1)/3 )\n\n4. Use that value as the input to the third part's process.\n\n5. Generate the list of 4-7 numbers with equal counts, sort them, find the first >= the second part's value, output that.\n\nNow, let's structure the C code.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read n, L, R, QL, QR. Then read n integers into an array W.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array. Since in Python it's sum_el[0] =0, then sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1], for i from 1 to n.\n\nIn C, we can have an array sum_el of size n+1.\n\nThen compute the initial answer as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\nCompute energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]).\n\nThen check if i > (n -i) \u2192 which is equivalent to i > n/2. Then add (i - (n-i) -1)*QL. Wait, the code says:\n\nif i > (n -i):\n\n    energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL\n\nelif (n -i) > i:\n\n    energy += ((n -i) -i -1)*QR\n\nWait, the first condition is when i is more than half of n. The second is when the remaining (n-i) is more than i. So the else if is when (n-i) >i \u2192 which is the opposite of the first condition. So the two conditions are mutually exclusive except when n is even and i is exactly n/2, but in that case, neither is true, so no addition.\n\nWait, but in code, the first condition is i > (n -i). Let me see:\n\nSuppose n is 5, i=3 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 yes. So add (3-2-1)*QL \u2192 (0)*QL \u2192 0? Wait, 3-2 is 1, minus 1 \u2192 0. So no addition. Hmm, maybe I need to recheck the code.\n\nWait the code says:\n\nif i > (n -i):\n\n    energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL\n\nWait, the term (i - (n-i) -1) \u2192 (2i -n -1). So when i is greater than (n-i), that is, when 2i >n \u2192 then 2i -n -1 could be positive or not. For example, if n=5 and i=3 \u2192 2i=6 \u2192 6-5-1=0 \u2192 so adds 0. Hmm, maybe the code has a mistake here? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nWait the code's logic is:\n\nThe energy is computed as L*sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el_total - sum_el[i]).\n\nThen, depending on whether the current i is more than the remaining elements (n-i), add some term.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when the current i is the split point, the number of elements to the left is i, to the right is n-i. The difference between left and right is (i - (n-i)), so the absolute difference is |2i -n|. The code adds QL or QR based on which side is longer.\n\nWait the code's first condition is if i > (n-i) \u2192 left is longer. Then the energy is increased by (i - (n-i) -1)*QL. The \"-1\" is confusing. Let me see:\n\nSuppose i is 3, n is 5 \u2192 left is 3, right is 2. The difference is 1. So the term is (3-2 -1) \u2192 0 \u2192 so no addition. Hmm, maybe the code is adding (difference -1) * QL? Not sure. But regardless, in C, I need to translate the code exactly as written.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each i from 1 to n:\n\n    energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n\n    if (i > (n -i)) {\n\n        energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL;\n\n    } else if ( (n -i) > i ) {\n\n        energy += ( (n -i) - i -1 ) * QR;\n\n    }\n\n    if (energy < answer) answer = energy;\n\nSo that's the code. So in C, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: the second part's input is the first's answer. So after computing the first answer, compute second_val = (2*answer +1)/3.\n\nThird part: the third part's input is second_val. So we need to generate all the numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts, sort them, then find the first element >= second_val.\n\nNow, the third part's code in C:\n\nWe can represent the list as an array. Let's precompute all possible numbers.\n\nWe can use a recursive function to generate them. Let's have a global array (or a static array) to store the numbers, and a counter.\n\nWait, in C, using a global array might be easier. Let's see:\n\nWe can have an array l of size 350 (as calculated before), and a variable count to track how many elements are stored.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nThe recursive function gen can take parameters: current number, current four count, current seven count.\n\nWait, the parameters in the Python code are (number, four, seven). So in C, the function would be:\n\nvoid gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n\n    if (number > 1e10) return;\n\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n\n        l[count++] = number;\n\n    }\n\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the initial call is gen(0,0,0). So starting with 0, then adding 4 or 7. But when number is 0, adding 4 gives 4 (four=1, seven=0). Then, when the next step adds 7, etc.\n\nWait, but the condition is number>0 and four == seven. So the first valid number is when four and seven are equal and number is non-zero. So for example, when number is 47 (four=1, seven=1), that's valid. The initial 0 is not counted.\n\nWait, the first valid number is when after some steps, four and seven counts are equal and number is non-zero.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in C, the recursion depth is manageable as discussed.\n\nNow, in C, the numbers can be stored in an array. Let's see:\n\nWe can have an array l of size 350, and a variable count initialized to 0.\n\nBut in C, we need to pass the array and count as parameters to the function, or use global variables. Since recursion is involved, using global variables might be easier.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a static array and a static counter. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in C, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize the array l as a global array of size 350, and a global variable count =0.\n\nThen, the gen function is called with initial parameters.\n\nWait, but in C, the function parameters can't modify the count variable unless it's a pointer. So perhaps better to use a global variable.\n\nAlternatively, pass a pointer to count. Let me see:\n\nWait, the function signature would be:\n\nvoid gen(long long number, int four, int seven, int *count, long long *list) {\n\n    ... \n\n    if (condition) {\n\n        list[*count] = number;\n\n        (*count)++;\n\n    }\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nBut this complicates the recursive calls, as each call would need to pass the list and count pointers. Maybe using global variables is easier here.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum count is known (350), we can pre-allocate the array and use a global count variable.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nlong long l[350];\n\nint count =0;\n\nvoid gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n\n    if (number > 10000000000LL) return; // 1e10\n\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n\n        l[count] = number;\n\n        count++;\n\n    }\n\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the initial call is gen(0,0,0). So when number is 0, four and seven are 0. So the condition (number>0) is false, so it's not added. Then, the function proceeds to call gen(0*10+4, 1,0) and gen(0*10+7,0,1).\n\nThen, for example, when number is 4 (four=1, seven=0), the next steps would be adding 4 or 7. The first call would be 44 (four=2, seven=0), which is over the condition. The second call would be 47 (four=1, seven=1). Then, since number is 47>0 and four=1 == seven=1, so it's added to the list.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nOnce the gen function is called, the list l will be filled with all valid numbers, and count will be the number of elements.\n\nThen, we need to sort the array l. Since the list is generated in some order, but the code in Python sorts it, so in C, we need to sort the array.\n\nIn C, we can use qsort. The array l has count elements. So after generating, we sort l in ascending order.\n\nThen, the input for the third part is the second_val (from the second part's calculation). We need to find the first element in the sorted array that is >= second_val. If none, then perhaps the last element? But according to the code, if all elements are smaller, then the loop would not set ans, so it would print 0. But that's probably an error. However, given the problem constraints, perhaps the input is always within the possible numbers.\n\nSo in C, after sorting, we can loop through the array and find the first element >= second_val. Once found, output it.\n\nAlternatively, use binary search for efficiency, but since the array is small (350 elements), a linear search is acceptable.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe C program structure:\n\nRead the first part's inputs.\n\nCompute first part's answer.\n\nCompute second_val = (2*answer +1)/3.\n\nGenerate the list of 4-7 numbers with equal counts, sort them.\n\nFind the first element in the sorted list >= second_val.\n\nPrint that element.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables for the first part:\n\nint n, L, R, QL, QR;\n\nint W[100000]; // assuming n can be up to 1e5? Wait, looking at the first Python code, the W array is read as list(map(int, input().split())). So the input after the first line is a list of n integers. So in C, the maximum n could be up to, say, 1e5? But the problem may not specify. Let's assume n is up to 1e5, so array size 1e5+1 for sum_el.\n\nWait, but in the first Python code, the sum_el is built with n+1 elements. So in C, sum_el can be an array of size n+1. But since n is read first, we can't have a static array. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, in C, we can't have a variable-length array unless using C99. So perhaps the problem expects that n is not too big. Let me check the first Python code's variables.\n\nThe first part's code uses a loop for i in 1..n, and the W array is of length n. So in C, we can read n first, then allocate arrays dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that n is up to, say, 1e5, but in the problem's context, perhaps n is small. Let me see the problem's first code's variables. The first code's answer is QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R. So n can be up to some value, but in C, we need to handle it.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in C, if n is large, we can't have a static array. So perhaps the problem expects that n is manageable. Let me think of possible constraints. Since the first code's loop runs n times, and the sum_el array is of size n+1, perhaps n is up to 1e5, but in C, using a dynamic array is better.\n\nWait, but in C, for variable-length arrays, if the compiler supports C99, we can do:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nint W[n]; // but this is C99.\n\nAlternatively, use malloc. Let's proceed with dynamic allocation.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n, L, R, QL, QR.\n\nRead n integers into W array.\n\nCompute sum_el array.\n\nCompute the initial answer.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Third part's variables and functions.\n\nlong long l[350];\nint count =0;\n\nvoid gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n    if (number > 10000000000LL) return;\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n        l[count] = number;\n        count++;\n    }\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // First part's variables\n    int n, L, R, QL, QR;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n    int *W = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &W[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Compute sum_el\n    int sum_el[n+1];\n    sum_el[0] =0;\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1];\n    }\n\n    // Compute initial answer\n    long long answer = QR * (n-1) + (long long)sum_el[n] * R;\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        long long energy = (long long)L * sum_el[i] + (long long)R * (sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n        if (i > (n -i)) {\n            energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL;\n        } else if ( (n -i) > i ) {\n            energy += ( (n -i) - i -1 ) * QR;\n        }\n        if (energy < answer) {\n            answer = energy;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Second part's calculation\n    int second_val = (2 * answer +1)/3;\n\n    // Third part's processing\n    // Generate the list\n    count =0;\n    gen(0,0,0);\n    // Sort the list\n    qsort(l, count, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n    // Find the first element >= second_val\n    long long res = -1;\n    for (int i=0; i<count; i++) {\n        if (l[i] >= second_val) {\n            res = l[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    // If not found, but according to problem constraints, it should be found.\n    // So output res.\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", res);\n\n    free(W);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but I need to define the compare function for qsort.\n\nThe compare function for qsort should be:\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return *(long long*)a - *(long long*)b;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the compare function must return a signed integer. However, if the difference is larger than INT_MAX, it could overflow. But since the numbers are up to 1e10, the difference can be up to 1e10, which is larger than 2^31 (~2e9). So this could cause issues. To avoid that, better to cast to long long and compare:\n\nWait, but the compare function must return an int. So perhaps better to do:\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    long long x = *(long long*)a;\n    long long y = *(long long*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo adding that function.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait, also, in the first part's code, the variables L, R, QL, QR are integers, but when multiplied by large numbers (sum_el[n] could be up to n*1e9, so for n up to 1e5, sum_el[n] could be 1e14, multiplied by R (say 1e9) gives 1e23, which is way beyond 64-bit integer. Wait, but in the problem's first code, the variables are integers, but in C, using long long for the energy and answer variables is necessary.\n\nWait, in the first part's code, the variables like L, R, etc. are read as integers, but when multiplied by sum_el[i], which can be up to sum of n elements. So in C, using long long for the energy and answer variables is essential to prevent overflow.\n\nIn the code above, I have:\n\nanswer is declared as long long.\n\nenergy is computed as (long long)L * sum_el[i], etc. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the code for the third part's gen function must be called with initial parameters. The code in main calls gen(0,0,0), which is correct.\n\nWait, in the code above, after the first part's processing, the third part's code is:\n\ncount =0;\n\ngen(0,0,0);\n\nThen, sort the array l, then search.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nFor example, if the second_val is 47, then the first element in the list (after sorting) is 47, so it would be selected.\n\nAnother case: second_val is 46 \u2192 the first element is 47.\n\nAnother case: second_val is 74 \u2192 which is in the list (since 74 is 7 and 4, counts 1 each \u2192 yes. So it would be found.\n\nNow, the code should handle all that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The array l's size is 350. Let me confirm the maximum count.\n\nEarlier calculation: 2+6+20+70+252 = 350. So the array is exactly the right size. So no overflow.\n\n- The gen function must be called before sorting.\n\n- The compare function must be properly defined.\n\n- The variables in the first part must be correctly handled.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's loop for i from 1 to n, the code uses sum_el[i], which is correct.\n\nNow, compiling this code may require including the compare function before it's used.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe full C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nlong long l[350];\nint count = 0;\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    long long x = *(long long*)a;\n    long long y = *(long long*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n    if (number > 10000000000LL) return;\n    if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n        l[count] = number;\n        count++;\n    }\n    gen(number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven);\n    gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // First part\n    int n, L, R, QL, QR;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n    int *W = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &W[i]);\n    }\n\n    int sum_el[n + 1];\n    sum_el[0] = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        sum_el[i] = sum_el[i - 1] + W[i - 1];\n    }\n\n    long long answer = QR * (n - 1) + (long long)sum_el[n] * R;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        long long energy = (long long)L * sum_el[i] + (long long)R * (sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n        if (i > (n - i)) {\n            energy += (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL;\n        } else if ((n - i) > i) {\n            energy += ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR;\n        }\n        if (energy < answer) {\n            answer = energy;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Second part\n    int second_val = (2 * answer + 1) / 3;\n\n    // Third part\n    count = 0;\n    gen(0, 0, 0);\n    qsort(l, count, sizeof(long long), compare);\n\n    long long res = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n        if (l[i] >= second_val) {\n            res = l[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", res);\n\n    free(W);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the third part's code, after generating the list, the count is the number of elements. So when calling qsort, the second argument is count, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after calling gen(0,0,0), the count is set to 0 before the call? No, the code says:\n\ncount =0;\n\ngen(0,0,0);\n\nSo yes, that's correct. The initial count is 0, then the gen function fills the array.\n\nNow, testing the code for possible errors.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's loop for i from 1 to n, the code uses sum_el[i], which is correct.\n\nThe energy calculation uses L and R multiplied by the sum elements, which are integers, but stored as long long to prevent overflow.\n\nThe second_val is an integer, so (2*answer +1)/3. Since answer is a long long, but when multiplied by 2, it's still okay as long as it's within 64 bits.\n\nThe third part's code uses the second_val as the input, which is an integer, and the list elements are long long, so the comparison is okay.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
