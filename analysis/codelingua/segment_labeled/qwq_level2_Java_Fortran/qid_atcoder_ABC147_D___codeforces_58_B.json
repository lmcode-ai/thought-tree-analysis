  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC147_D. It reads an integer n, then an array of n longs. Then it calculates some value ans by iterating over each bit from 0 to 59. For each bit i, it counts how many numbers in the array have that bit set (count1). Then it computes a as count1*(n - count1), shifts it left by (i) times (since each shift multiplies by 2, but maybe I need to check the loop here). Wait, the code for a is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code for a is initialized to 0, then a += count1*(n - count1). Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, it shifts a left by 1 mod div. Wait, no, the loop is for j from 0 to i, but the loop is for j < i. Wait, the loop is for (int j=0; j < i; j++), so it runs i times. So each time, a is multiplied by 2 (shift left 1), mod div. So the total is a multiplied by 2^i. Because each iteration multiplies by 2, so after i times, it's 2^i times the original a. \n\nWait, the initial a is count1*(n - count1). Then, after shifting i times, it becomes a * 2^i. Then this is added to ans, mod div. So the total ans is the sum over all bits of (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i, mod div each step. \n\nHmm, okay. So the first program's output is the ans value computed here. \n\nThe second Java program, codeforces_58_B, takes an integer n, then prints n followed by the largest possible sequence of numbers decreasing by factors. Wait, the code is: it starts with m = n, then for i from n-1 down to 1, if m is divisible by i, then print i and set m to i. So it's finding the largest possible sequence where each next number divides the previous one. The output is a space-separated list starting with n, then each next number that divides the current m. \n\nWait, but the first line of the second program's output is \"n + \" followed by a space? Wait, no, looking at the code: \n\nThe first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print n followed by a space and a newline. Then, in the loop, for each i from n-1 down to 1, if m%i ==0, then print i + \" \" (so again, i followed by space and newline?), but actually, in Java, each println adds a new line. Wait, the code for the second program's first print is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \"); \n\nSo that would print n followed by a space and then a new line. Then, in the loop, for each valid i, it does System.out.println(i + \" \"); which again adds a space and a new line. So the output is each number on its own line with a trailing space. But maybe the problem expects a single line? Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I have to translate it as is. \n\nWait, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the ans value, which is then the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects an integer n as input. So the first program's output is a single number, which is the input to the second program. \n\nWait, the first program's output is ans, which is a long. The second program reads an integer n from stdin. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's n is the ans from the first. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input (the initial input for the first Java program), process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second program. \n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n and the array A) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the ans as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Then, take that ans as the input to the second program's logic, which is to generate the sequence starting with that number, then the largest possible divisors in decreasing steps.\n\n4. Output the result of the second program, which is the sequence of numbers as per the second Java code.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate both steps into Fortran, ensuring that the first step's output is used as the second's input without any I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and the array A from stdin.\n\n- Compute ans as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n- Then, take ans as the input to the second program's logic (the codeforces problem's code).\n\n- Output the result of the second program's processing.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran:\n\nThe first part:\n\nRead n, then n longs. In Fortran, integers can be 64-bit (using integer(8)), so we can read them as such.\n\nThe loop over bits from 0 to 59:\n\nFor each bit i (0-based), count how many elements in A have that bit set. \n\nThen compute count1*(n - count1), multiply by 2^i, sum all these terms mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\na starts at 0, then a += count1*(n - count1). Then shifts a left by i times (since the loop runs i times, each shift left 1). So the total is (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i. Because each shift left 1 multiplies by 2, so after i shifts, it's multiplied by 2^i. \n\nWait, the code for a is:\n\nlong a = 0;\n\na = a + count1*(n - count1); \n\nThen, for each j from 0 to i-1, a = (a <<1) % div. \n\nWait, the initial a is 0, then adding count1*(n - count1) gives a = count1*(n - count1). Then, shifting left i times (since the loop runs i times). So the total is (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div. \n\nSo the contribution to ans for each bit is (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div. \n\nTherefore, the total ans is the sum over all bits of that term, mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize ans = 0\n\ndiv = 10^9 +7\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 59:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\ndo j = 1 to n (since arrays in Fortran are 1-based by default, but maybe we can use 0-based with explicit indices)\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So perhaps better to use 1-based here. So the array A has size n, elements A(1) to A(n).\n\nFor each i from 0 to 59:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\ndo j = 1 to n\n\nif (btest(A(j), i)) then count1 = count1 +1\n\nend do\n\nterm = count1 * (n - count1)\n\nterm = term * (2**i) mod div ?\n\nWait, but 2^i can be large. Since mod is involved, perhaps better to compute (count1*(n - count1)) mod div first, then multiply by 2^i mod div, but considering that 2^i can be up to 2^59, which is manageable modulo 1e9+7?\n\nWait, but 2^i mod div can be precomputed. Alternatively, compute term * (2^i) mod div. \n\nWait, the term is count1*(n - count1). Then multiply by 2^i, then mod div. \n\nBut 2^i can be up to 2^59, which is a huge number. However, since we are modding by 1e9+7, perhaps we can compute 2^i mod div first, then multiply by term, then mod again. \n\nAlternatively, compute (count1*(n - count1)) mod div, then multiply by (2^i mod div), then mod again. \n\nWait, but the original code in Java does:\n\na = count1*(n - count1)\n\nthen shifts left by i bits (equivalent to multiplying by 2^i), then mod div. \n\nBut shifting left by i bits is equivalent to multiplying by 2^i. However, since a is a long, it can hold the value before mod. But in Java, the mod is applied after shifting. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the shifting is done with mod each time. Let me re-express the code:\n\na starts as count1*(n - count1). \n\nThen, for each of the i shifts (since the loop runs i times):\n\na = (a <<1) % div. \n\nWait, each shift left by 1 is equivalent to multiplying by 2, then mod. \n\nSo after i shifts, the value is (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div. \n\nYes, because each step multiplies by 2 and mods. So the total is (count1*(n - count1) * 2^i) mod div. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each i, compute term = (count1*(n - count1)) * (2**i) mod div. \n\nBut 2**i can be up to 2^59, which is about 5e17. Since mod is 1e9+7, we can compute 2^i mod div first. \n\nAlternatively, compute 2^i mod div as a separate variable. \n\nLet me think: \n\nWe can precompute pow2(0 to 59) mod div. Since 59 is small, this is manageable. \n\nAlternatively, compute 2^i mod div on the fly. \n\nIn Fortran, exponentiation can be done with ** operator, but for large exponents, it might overflow. However, since we can compute mod at each step. \n\nAlternatively, compute pow2 = 1, then loop from 1 to i, multiplying by 2 each time and modding. \n\nWait, for each i, 2^i mod div can be computed as (2^i) mod div. \n\nAlternatively, precompute an array pow2(0:59) where pow2(i) = 2^i mod div. \n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo first, precompute pow2 array. \n\ndiv = 10**9 +7\n\npow2(0) = 1\n\nfor i from 1 to 59:\n\npow2(i) = (pow2(i-1)*2) mod div \n\nThen, for each bit i, the term is (count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i)) mod div. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the term is (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div. \n\nYes, so that's exactly what this gives. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nFirst, precompute pow2 array. \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 59:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\nloop over all elements in A, count how many have the i-th bit set. \n\nThen compute term = (count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i)) mod div \n\nAdd this to ans, then mod div again. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, ans is accumulated as ans += a (which is the term), then mod div. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize ans =0 \n\nprecompute pow2 array. \n\nloop over i from 0 to 59:\n\ncompute count1 \n\ncompute term = (count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i)) mod div \n\nans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nSo that's manageable. \n\nNow, the second part: the codeforces problem's code. \n\nThe second program takes an integer n (which is the ans from first part), then outputs n followed by a space, then for each i from n-1 down to 1, if current m (starting at n) is divisible by i, then print i followed by a space, and set m to i. \n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nint m = n;\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i>0; i--):\n\n   if (m%i ==0) {\n\n      System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\n      m =i;\n\n   }\n\nWait, but the first print is n followed by a space and a new line. Then each subsequent print is i followed by space and new line. \n\nBut the problem says that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the ans from first, which is a number. \n\nIn Fortran, the second part's input is the ans computed in the first part. \n\nSo the second part's logic is:\n\nTake the ans (call it input_n), then:\n\nprint input_n followed by a space (but in Fortran, how to do that? The first print would be write(*,*) input_n, ' ', but then new line. Then, for the loop, similar. \n\nWait, the code's first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which in Java would output \"n \" followed by a new line. \n\nSo in Fortran, the first output line is the input_n followed by a space, then a new line. \n\nThen, for each i from input_n-1 down to 1:\n\nif m (initialized to input_n) is divisible by i, then print i followed by a space and new line, and set m to i. \n\nWait, but the loop is from n-1 down to 1. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--). So starting at n-1, decrementing until 1. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nm = input_n\n\nwrite(*,*) m, ' ' \n\nthen loop i from m-1 down to 1:\n\n   if mod(m, i) ==0 then \n\n      write(*,*) i, ' '\n\n      m = i\n\n   end if \n\nWait, but the loop is from n-1 down to 1, but in the code, n is the original input. Wait, no, in the second program, the input is the ans from first, which is input_n. So the loop is from input_n-1 down to 1. \n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nint m = n; \n\nfor (int i = n-1; i>0; i--):\n\n   if (m%i ==0) then print and set m. \n\nSo the loop variable i starts at n-1 (the input's n is the ans from first program). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo i = input_n -1, 1, -1 \n\n   if (mod(m, i) ==0) then \n\n      write(*,*) i, ' '\n\n      m = i \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nBut the first print is the initial m (input_n) followed by a space. \n\nWait, but in the code, after the first print, the m is still n. So the first print is n followed by space and new line. \n\nThen, in the loop, for each i from n-1 down to 1, check if m (which is n) is divisible by i. \n\nWait, but in the code, m is set to i only when the condition is met. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct. \n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n and the array A from input. \n\n2. Compute ans as per first Java program. \n\n3. Then, take ans as input_n, and process it through the second program's logic. \n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n integers (longs, but in Fortran, using integer(8)). \n\nThen compute the ans. \n\nThen, process the second part. \n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, A(100000) ! assuming n can be up to 1e5? The first Java code uses an array of size n. Need to set a sufficiently large size. \n\ninteger(8) :: ans, div, pow2(0:59), i, j, count1, term\n\ninteger(8) :: input_n, m, current_i\n\ndiv = 10**9 +7\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(A(n)) ! Wait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed size. Hmm, but if n can be up to 1e5, maybe better to read n first, then allocate. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can use allocatable arrays. \n\nSo:\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(A(n))\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   read*, A(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute pow2 array\n\nallocate(pow2(0:59))\n\npow2(0) = 1\n\ndo i=1,59\n\n   pow2(i) = mod(2*pow2(i-1), div)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute ans\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=0,59\n\n   count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   term = mod( count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i), div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\n! Now process the second part\n\ninput_n = ans\n\nm = input_n\n\n! First print\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') m, ' '\n\n! Wait, but in Java it's a println, so after the space, a new line. \n\nWait, the Java code's first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which outputs \"n \" followed by a new line. \n\nIn Fortran, to write the number followed by a space and a new line, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') m, ' '\n\nBut that would write m, then a space, then a new line. \n\nWait, the format '(I0, A)' would write the integer as is, then the string ' ', then a new line. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid a trailing space on the last line, but according to the Java code, each print has a space. \n\nHmm, perhaps better to use:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') m, ' '\n\nthen write a new line. \n\nWait, but the Java code uses println, which adds a new line. So the first print is \"n \" followed by a new line. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') m, ' '\n\nBut that would write m, then a space, then a new line. \n\nWait, the format is I0 followed by A. The A is a character, which is ' ', so the output would be \"m \" followed by a new line. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, the loop:\n\ndo current_i = input_n -1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, current_i) == 0) then \n\n      write(*, '(I0, A)') current_i, ' '\n\n      m = current_i\n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nWait, but the loop starts at input_n -1, which is the initial input_n (ans) minus 1. \n\nWait, but input_n could be very large. For example, if ans is 1e9, then the loop would go down to 1, which is 1e9 iterations. That might be a problem for performance, but the original Java code does the same, so we have to proceed. \n\nBut in Fortran, loops can handle that. \n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the loop is for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--). So the loop variable starts at n-1 (the input's n is the ans from first program). \n\nYes, so in Fortran, the loop variable current_i starts at input_n -1 and goes down to 1, stepping by -1. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBut need to make sure that the pow2 array is properly allocated. \n\nWait, in the code above, after reading n, we allocate A(n). Then, we allocate pow2(0:59). \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with fixed sizes. Since 60 elements is small, perhaps better to declare it as a fixed array. \n\nAlternatively, use an allocatable array. \n\nAlternatively, since 0:59 is fixed, we can declare it as integer(8), dimension(0:59) :: pow2. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, ans, div, input_n, m, current_i\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:59) :: pow2\n\ndiv = 10**9 +7\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(A(n))\n\nread*, A(1:n)\n\n! Compute pow2 array\n\npow2(0) = 1\n\ndo i=1,59\n\n   pow2(i) = mod(2*pow2(i-1), div)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute ans\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=0,59\n\n   integer(8) :: count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   integer(8) :: term = mod( count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i), div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\n! Process second part\n\ninput_n = ans\n\nm = input_n\n\n! First print\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') m, ' '\n\ndo current_i = input_n -1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, current_i) == 0) then \n\n      write(*, '(I0, A)') current_i, ' '\n\n      m = current_i\n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\ndeallocate(A)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for count1, I need to declare count1 inside the loop. Wait, in the code above, inside the do i=0,59 loop, I have:\n\ninteger(8) :: count1 =0\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside loops like that. So that's an error. \n\nAh right, so need to move the declaration outside. \n\nSo, correct code:\n\nInside the ans computation loop:\n\ncount1 is declared before the loop. \n\nWait, let me restructure that part:\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=0,59\n\n   integer(8) count1 =0 \n\nNo, can't do that. \n\nInstead, declare count1 and term outside the loop. \n\nWait, better to declare count1 inside the i loop. \n\nWait, in Fortran, variables must be declared at the beginning of the scope. \n\nSo, inside the main program, after declarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: count1, term\n\nThen, inside the i loop:\n\ncount1 =0 \n\nthen loop over j. \n\nSo:\n\n! Compute ans\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=0,59\n\n   count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   term = mod( count1*(n - count1) * pow2(i), div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\nThat should work. \n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the btest function checks if the bit is set. The bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) upwards, which matches the Java code's approach. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nNow, the second part's loop: \n\nThe loop runs from current_i = input_n -1 down to 1. \n\nBut if input_n is 1, then input_n -1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run. \n\nWhich is correct, since the loop condition is i>0. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--). \n\nIn Fortran, the loop is written as do current_i = input_n -1, 1, -1. \n\nWhich is correct, since when current_i reaches 1, it will execute (since the upper limit is input_n-1, but the step is -1, so it includes 1 as long as input_n-1 >=1. \n\nWait, the loop in Fortran is from start to end, stepping by -1. So if input_n is 2, then start is 1, end is 1, so it runs once. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, testing edge cases. \n\nSuppose the first program's ans is 1. Then the second part's first print is 1 followed by space and new line. Then the loop starts at 0 (since input_n-1 is 0), so the loop doesn't run. So the output is just \"1 \" followed by a new line. \n\nWhich matches the Java code. \n\nAnother test case: if ans is 6. \n\nThe first print is 6 followed by space and new line. \n\nThen the loop starts at 5 down to 1. \n\nCheck for each i from 5 down to 1:\n\nm starts at 6. \n\ni=5: 6 mod5 is 1, so no. \n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2 \u2192 no. \n\ni=3: 6 mod3 is 0 \u2192 yes. So print 3 followed by space and new line. m becomes 3. \n\nThen i=2: check m=3 mod2 \u2192 1 \u2192 no. \n\ni=1: m=3 mod1 is 0 \u2192 yes. Print 1 followed by space and new line. m becomes 1. \n\nSo the output lines are:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nEach followed by a space and new line. \n\nWhich matches the Java code's logic. \n\nNow, the code should be correct. \n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part, the array A is read as 1-based in Fortran. The Java code uses 0-based, but since the loop runs from 0 to n-1 in Java, in Fortran, the loop from 1 to n is equivalent. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the final Fortran code should look like this."
