  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC158_B) takes three inputs: N, A, B. It calculates some value k and then outputs a number based on conditions. The second Java file (codeforces_622_A) takes a position as input, does some calculations involving sequences, and outputs another number. The key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (N, A, B), process them through the first algorithm, then take that result as the input for the second algorithm, and finally output the final result.\n\nLet me break down each Java program step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's main logic is:\n\n- Read N, A, B.\n- Check some constraints (though maybe the Fortran can ignore those since the problem says to reproduce the same behavior, so perhaps the constraints are just for the problem's input, but in the translation, we can proceed as per the code).\n- Compute k as N/(A+B) if A+B <= N.\n- Then decide based on whether the remainder after k*(A+B) is more than A or not. The output is either A*k + (remainder) or A*k + remainder minus something? Wait, let me recheck the code.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIf A+B <= N:\n    k = N/(A+B)\n    remainder = N - k*(A+B)\n    if remainder > A:\n        output A*k + (remainder - (N - (k*(A+B)+A))) \n        Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me compute that expression.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first part is A*k + (remainder) which is A*k + (N - k*(A+B)).\n\nBut in the first case, when remainder > A, the code does:\n\nSystem.out.println(A * k + (N - k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)));\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nThe first term is A*k + (N - k*(A+B)) \u2192 which is A*k + remainder.\n\nThen subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 which is N - (k*(A+B)+A) = (N -k*(A+B)) - A = remainder - A.\n\nSo the total becomes (A*k + remainder) - (remainder - A) \u2192 A*k + A \u2192 A*(k+1).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So when remainder > A, the output is A*(k+1). Because:\n\nLet me see:\n\nOriginal code's first case:\n\nIf remainder > A:\n\nThe printed value is A*k + (N - k*(A+B)) \u2192 which is A*k + remainder \u2192 but then subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 which is (N -k*(A+B) - A) \u2192 (remainder - A). So the total is (A*k + remainder) - (remainder - A) \u2192 A*k + A \u2192 A*(k+1).\n\nWait, that's a simplification. So perhaps the code can be rewritten as:\n\nif remainder > A \u2192 output A*(k+1)\n\nelse \u2192 output A*k + remainder.\n\nWait, but why would the code be written that way? Maybe there's a mistake here, but I have to follow the code as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the expression is as written. Let me re-calculate:\n\nThe first part is A*k + (N -k*(A+B)) \u2192 which is A*k + remainder.\n\nThen subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 which is N - (k*(A+B) + A) \u2192 (N -k*(A+B)) - A \u2192 remainder - A.\n\nSo the total is (A*k + remainder) - (remainder - A) \u2192 A*k + remainder - remainder + A \u2192 A*(k+1).\n\nSo the code's first case when remainder > A is equivalent to A*(k+1).\n\nHmm, that's a simpler way to write it, but perhaps the code is written that way for some reason. Anyway, the code's logic must be followed exactly.\n\nThe other conditions:\n\nElse if (A+B > N and A <= N) \u2192 output A.\n\nElse (probably when A+B > N but A > N? Then output N).\n\nWait, the code's else clause is when A+B > N, but if A > N, then output N. Because if A is larger than N, then even the first A can't be fully counted. For example, if N is 3, A is 5, B is 0, then since A+B is 5>3, but A is 5>3, so the output is N (3). But if A is 2, B is 1, then A+B is 3 which is equal to N, so the first case applies. Wait, but the first condition is A+B <= N. So the else if is when A+B > N, but A <= N \u2192 then output A. Because in that case, the total possible A is A, but since A+B exceeds N, you can only have A once, but only if A is <= N. So if A is 0, then output 0? Wait, but the code's condition is \"A <= N\".\n\nSo the first program's logic is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible A's in the sequence of A followed by B, repeated as much as possible. The output is the total A's plus the remainder if possible.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (codeforces_622_A):\n\nThis program takes a position (the output of the first program) and finds which \"block\" it's in. The sequence is constructed such that each block starts at a certain index. The getValueAtIndex function returns the starting position of the block. The code finds the nearest starting index such that the next block's start is beyond the given position. Then, the output is (position - start) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is given as 1 + (index-1)*index/2. Let me see:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(1) \u2192 1 + 0 \u2192 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) \u2192 1 + (1)*2/2 \u2192 1+1=2.\n\nWait, no: (2-1)*2/2 \u2192 (1)*2/2 =1 \u2192 1+1=2.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(3) \u2192 1 + (2)*3/2 \u2192 1 + 3 \u21924?\n\nWait, (3-1)*3/2 \u2192 2*3/2 =3 \u2192 1+3=4.\n\nYes. So the starting position for index i is S(i) = 1 + (i-1)*i/2.\n\nThe sequence is built such that each block i has length i. The first block (index 1) is length 1 (positions 1), the second (index 2) is length 2 (positions 2-3), third (index3) is length 3 (positions4-6), etc. Wait, no, the starting position for index i is S(i) = 1 + sum_{k=1 to i-1} k \u2192 which is 1 + (i-1)*i/2. So the block i starts at S(i) and has length i. So the end of block i is S(i) + (i-1) \u2192 S(i)+i-1 = 1 + (i-1)i/2 +i-1 = 1 + (i^2 -i + 2i -2)/2 \u2192 Hmm, perhaps not necessary. The key is that the starting position of block i is S(i) = 1 + (i-1)*i/2.\n\nThe code's solve function:\n\nIt takes the input position, and finds the nearest starting index. The first loop multiplies nrstSeqStartIndx by 2 until the next block's start is beyond the position. Then, it increments until the next block's start is beyond the position. The final start is the starting index's S(nrstSeqStartIndx). The output is (position - start) +1, which is the position within the block.\n\nSo the second program's job is to take a position and find which block it's in, then output its position within the block.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read N, A, B, compute the first program's output (let's call it pos), then compute the second program's result using pos as input, and output that.\n\nThe challenge is to translate both into Fortran, with only the first part reading input, the second part writing output, and no intermediate I/O.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, A, B from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (pos) using the logic from the first Java code.\n\n3. Use pos as the input to the second program's logic, compute the final result.\n\n4. Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating the first Java code into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first program's logic:\n\nVariables:\n\nN, A, B are input as integers (but in Java they are long, so in Fortran, use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18) for 64-bit integers).\n\nThe code checks some conditions, but perhaps in the problem's context, the constraints are already satisfied, so maybe we can skip them. The problem says to reproduce the same behavior, so the code must handle all cases as per the original.\n\nSo proceed with the logic.\n\nCompute k = N/(A+B) when A+B <= N.\n\nThen, remainder = mod(N, A+B) \u2192 but in Fortran, mod(a,b) gives the remainder with the same sign as b. Since N and A+B are positive, mod(N, A+B) is correct.\n\nWait, in Java, N/(A+B) is integer division, truncating towards zero. In Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for integers, it truncates towards zero. So that's okay.\n\nSo:\n\nif (A + B <= N) then\n\n   k = N/(A+B)\n\n   remainder = mod(N, A+B)\n\n   if (remainder > A) then\n\n      result = A*k + (remainder - (N - (k*(A+B) + A)))\n\n      Wait, but earlier analysis shows that this simplifies to A*(k+1). Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, the code's first case:\n\nA + B <= N:\n\n   k = N/(A+B)\n\n   remainder = N - k*(A+B)\n\n   if (remainder > A):\n\n       output A*k + (N - k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A))\n\n       Let me compute that:\n\n       The first part is A*k + remainder \u2192 A*k + (N -k*(A+B)).\n\n       Then subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 which is N - (k*(A+B)+A) = (N -k*(A+B)) - A \u2192 remainder - A.\n\n       So total is (A*k + remainder) - (remainder - A) \u2192 A*k + A \u2192 A*(k+1).\n\n   else:\n\n       output A*k + remainder.\n\nSo the code can be simplified to:\n\nif (remainder > A) then\n\n   result = A*(k+1)\n\nelse\n\n   result = A*k + remainder\n\nend if\n\nBut the original code uses the more complicated expression. Since the problem requires exact behavior, perhaps we should code it as per the original, but maybe the simplification is correct. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose A=2, B=3, N=10.\n\nA+B=5. N/(A+B)=2 \u2192 k=2. remainder=10-2*5=0.\n\nSince remainder (0) is not > A (2), so output A*k + remainder \u2192 2*2 +0 =4.\n\nAnother example: A=2, B=1, N=5 \u2192 A+B=3. N/(3)=1, remainder 2.\n\nSince remainder (2) > A (2?) No, equal. So the condition is \">\", so 2 is not greater than 2 \u2192 so output 2*1 +2 =4.\n\nWait, but if remainder is exactly A, then it's not greater, so the else case applies.\n\nAnother example where remainder is greater: A=2, B=1, N=6 \u2192 A+B=3. N/(3)=2 \u2192 remainder 0 \u2192 no. Wait, 6 mod 3 is 0. Hmm, maybe another example.\n\nLet me take N=7, A=2, B=3 \u2192 A+B=5. N/(5)=1, remainder 2. Since 2>2? No. So else case: 2*1 +2 =4.\n\nWait, perhaps another example where remainder exceeds A.\n\nLet me try A=1, B=2, N=5 \u2192 A+B=3. N/(3)=1, remainder 2. Since 2>1 \u2192 yes. So the first case applies. The code would compute A*k + (5-3*1) \u2192 1*1 +2 =3, then subtract (5 - (3+1)) \u2192 5-4=1 \u2192 3-1=2? Wait, no, let me compute the original code's expression:\n\nOriginal code's first case:\n\nA*k + (N -k*(A+B)) \u2192 1*1 + (5-3) \u2192 1+2=3.\n\nThen subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 5 - (3+1)=1 \u2192 3-1=2. So the output is 2?\n\nWait that contradicts the earlier simplification. Wait, what's the correct result here?\n\nWait, the problem's first program's logic is to compute the maximum number of A's possible in a sequence where each cycle is A followed by B, but you can stop early.\n\nWait, the problem's first program is from AtCoder ABC158 B, which is \"Vending Machine\".\n\nThe problem statement (from memory) is that the machine has A yen coins and B yen coins. You can buy a drink for 1 yen each, but you can only buy as many as the total coins. The question is how many A's you can have in the sequence of coins given N drinks bought. Wait, perhaps the problem is that each time you buy a drink, you get a coin of A or B, but the total coins must be non-negative. Wait, perhaps the problem is that you have a machine that dispenses coins in a sequence: A, B, A, B, etc. until you have N coins. The question is how many A's are there in the first N coins.\n\nAh, right! So the first program is counting the number of A's in the first N coins, where the coins are arranged in cycles of A followed by B, repeating. So for N coins, the number of full cycles is k = N/(A+B), and the remainder is r = N mod (A+B). The number of A's is k*A + min(r, A). Because in the remainder, the first 'A' coins are A's, then the next B are B's. So if the remainder is more than A, then you have A more A's. If it's less, then r A's.\n\nWait, that's exactly the logic. So the total A's would be k*A + (if r <=A then r else A). So the maximum possible A's is A*(k+1) when r>A.\n\nWait, so in the first example I had:\n\nA=1, B=2, N=5 \u2192 A+B=3. N=5 \u2192 k=1 (3*1=3, remainder 2). Since remainder (2) is greater than A (1), so total A's is 1*1 +1 (since A is 1, so min(2,1) is 1? Wait, no. Wait, the remainder is 2. The first A coins (1) are A's, then the next B (2) would be B's, but since remainder is 2, which is exactly A+B? Wait, no, remainder is N mod (A+B) \u2192 5 mod 3 is 2. So the remainder is 2. So the first 1 (A) is A, then the next 1 (since remainder is 2, which is A (1) +1 (B?), but the remainder is 2, so the first 1 is A, then 1 B. So total A's in remainder is 1. So total A's is 1*1 (from full cycles) +1 (from remainder) \u2192 2. Which matches the code's calculation.\n\nWait, according to the code's first case when remainder> A (1), the code would compute A*(k+1) \u2192 1*(1+1)=2, which is correct. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo the code's first case is indeed equivalent to A*(k+1) when remainder> A, and A*k + remainder otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the code can be simplified to that, but since the problem requires exact translation, perhaps it's better to code it as per the original code's expression, but in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, since the code's expression simplifies to that, perhaps it's better to code the simplified version for clarity, but the problem says to reproduce the same behavior, so the code must do exactly what the original does. Let me check the code's first case again.\n\nThe code's first case when remainder> A:\n\nThe printed value is A*k + (N -k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)).\n\nBreaking down:\n\nA*k + (N -k*(A+B)) \u2192 A*k + remainder.\n\nThen subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \u2192 which is N - (k*(A+B) + A) \u2192 (N -k*(A+B)) - A \u2192 remainder - A.\n\nSo the total is (A*k + remainder) - (remainder - A) \u2192 A*k + A \u2192 A*(k+1).\n\nSo the code's first case is indeed equivalent to A*(k+1). So the code can be written that way, but the original code uses the more complicated expression. Since the problem requires exact behavior, perhaps the code must be written as per the original, but in Fortran, the simplified version would give the same result. So perhaps it's okay to code the simplified version.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program takes a position (the output of the first program) and finds which block it's in. The blocks are as per the sequence where each block i starts at S(i) = 1 + (i-1)*i/2. The code finds the largest i such that S(i) \u2264 position, but the next block's start is beyond the position.\n\nThe code's approach is to first find a starting point by doubling until the next block's start exceeds the position. Then, it increments until the next block's start is beyond.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be implemented with loops.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is straightforward: S(i) = 1 + (i*(i-1))/2.\n\nThe solve function:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx to 1.\n\nWhile S(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position \u2192 multiply by 2.\n\nThen, while S(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) \u2264 position \u2192 increment nrstSeqStartIndx by 1.\n\nThen, the start is S(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nThe output is (position - start) +1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the position (from the first program's result).\n\nInitialize index =1.\n\nLoop while S(2*index) < position \u2192 index *=2.\n\nThen loop while S(index+1) <= position \u2192 index +=1.\n\nThen compute start = S(index).\n\nresult = (position - start) +1.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read N, A, B from input.\n\nCompute the first program's result (pos).\n\nThen compute the second program's result using pos as input.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nWe can use integer*8 variables for N, A, B, pos, etc., since the input can be up to 1e18.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead N, A, B.\n\nCompute pos:\n\nif (A + B ==0) then \u2192 but the problem's constraints say 0 < A+B, so perhaps we can ignore that.\n\nBut in code, first check if A+B >0.\n\nWait, the original code has conditions:\n\nif (1 <= N && N <= 1e18 && 0 <=A && 0 <= B && 0 < A+B && A+B <=1e18) \u2192 but in Fortran, perhaps we can proceed without checking, as per problem's input.\n\nProceeding:\n\nCompute:\n\nif (A + B > N) then:\n\n   if (A <= N) then \u2192 output A.\n\n   else \u2192 output N.\n\nelse:\n\n   k = N/(A+B)\n\n   remainder = mod(N, A+B)\n\n   if (remainder > A) then:\n\n      pos = A*(k+1)\n\n   else:\n\n      pos = A*k + remainder\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in code, the original code's else if (A+B > N and A <= N) \u2192 output A. Else (A+B>N and A>N \u2192 output N).\n\nWait, the code's else if is:\n\nelse if (A + B > N && A <= N) \u2192 output A.\n\nElse (the else clause) \u2192 output N.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (A+B <= N) \u2192 first case.\n\nElse if (A + B > N and A <= N) \u2192 output A.\n\nElse \u2192 output N.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (A + B <= N) then\n\n   ... compute pos as above.\n\nelse if ( (A + B > N) .and. (A <= N) ) then\n\n   pos = A\n\nelse\n\n   pos = N\n\nend if\n\nOnce pos is computed, then compute the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's variables:\n\nWe need to compute the result based on pos.\n\nInitialize index =1.\n\nCompute S(2*index) until it's >= pos.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position) \u2192 multiply by 2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nindex =1\n\ndo while (getValue(2*index) < pos)\n\n   index = index *2\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ndo while (getValue(index+1) <= pos)\n\n   index = index +1\n\nend do\n\nThen compute start = getValue(index)\n\nresult = pos - start +1\n\nThe function getValue is:\n\nfunction getValue(i) result(s)\n\n   integer*8 :: i, s\n\n   s = 1 + (i*(i-1))/2\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since i*(i-1) can be very large (up to 1e18?), but in the problem's constraints, the first program's N can be up to 1e18, so the second program's input (pos) can be up to A*(k+1), which could be up to (1e18) * (1e18/(0+1) +1) \u2192 but that's way too big. Wait, but the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is the number of A's in N coins. The maximum possible A's is N (if B=0). So the input to the second program can be up to N, which is up to 1e18. So the index in the second program can be up to sqrt(2*pos), since S(index) ~ index^2/2. So for pos up to 1e18, the index would be up to about 1e9, but even that might be too big for loops. Wait, but the first loop in the Java code is doubling the index each time, so it would take log2(index) steps. For 1e18, log2 is about 60 steps, so manageable.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with loops.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer*8 :: N, A, B, pos, result\n\n   integer*8 :: index, start\n\n   read(*,*) N, A, B\n\n   ! Compute pos using first program's logic\n\n   if (A + B <= N) then\n\n      integer*8 :: k, remainder\n\n      k = N/(A+B)\n\n      remainder = mod(N, A+B)\n\n      if (remainder > A) then\n\n         pos = A*(k+1)\n\n      else\n\n         pos = A*k + remainder\n\n      end if\n\n   else if ( (A + B > N) .and. (A <= N) ) then\n\n      pos = A\n\n   else\n\n      pos = N\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now compute the second part using pos as input\n\n   index =1\n\n   do while (getValue(2*index) < pos)\n\n      index = index *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValue(index+1) <= pos)\n\n      index = index +1\n\n   end do\n\n   start = getValue(index)\n\n   result = pos - start +1\n\n   write(*,*) result\n\ncontains\n\n   integer*8 function getValue(i)\n\n      integer*8, intent(in) :: i\n\n      getValue = 1 + (i*(i-1))/2\n\n   end function getValue\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the function getValue must be inside a module or contained in the program. Since I used 'contains' in the program, that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the function is inside the program's contains section, so that's correct.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The division in getValue: (i*(i-1))/2 must be integer division. Since in Fortran, when both operands are integers, the division is integer division. So for even and odd numbers, it's okay. For example, i=3 \u2192 3*2=6 \u2192 6/2=3 \u2192 correct. i=4 \u21924*3=12 \u21926 \u2192 correct.\n\n- The loops in the second part:\n\nThe first loop doubles index until S(2*index) >= pos. The second loop increments until S(index+1) > pos.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs pos=5.\n\nThen, the second program's steps:\n\nindex starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nCheck S(2) = 1 + (2*1)/2 = 2. Since 2 <5 \u2192 loop continues.\n\nindex becomes 2.\n\nCheck S(4) \u2192 1 + (4*3)/2 = 1+6=7. 7 >=5 \u2192 exit first loop.\n\nNow index is 2.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck S(3) \u2192 1 + (3*2)/2 =4. 4 <=5 \u2192 so increment index to 3.\n\nCheck S(4)=7 \u2192 7>5 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nThus, index is 3.\n\nstart = S(3)=4.\n\nresult =5-4 +1 =2.\n\nWhich is correct because position 5 is in the third block (starts at 4, length 3 \u2192 positions 4,5,6. So position 5 is the second in the block \u2192 2.\n\nAnother test case: pos=2.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nindex=1 \u2192 S(2)=2. Since 2 is not <2 \u2192 exit first loop.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck S(2)=2 <=2 \u2192 increment to 2.\n\nCheck S(3)=4>2 \u2192 exit.\n\nindex=2.\n\nstart = S(2)=2 \u2192 result 2-2+1=1 \u2192 correct (position 2 is first in block 2).\n\nAnother test case: pos=6.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nindex=1 \u2192 S(2)=2 <6 \u2192 index becomes 2.\n\nS(4)=7 \u2192 7>6 \u2192 exit first loop.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck S(3)=4 <=6 \u2192 increment to 3.\n\nCheck S(4)=7>6 \u2192 exit.\n\nindex=3.\n\nstart=4 \u2192 6-4+1=3 \u2192 correct (position 6 is third in block 3 (positions4-6).\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check the first part's logic with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nN=5, A=2, B=3 \u2192 A+B=5 \u22645.\n\nk=5/5=1, remainder=0.\n\nremainder (0) is not >A (2 \u2192 no. So pos =2*1 +0=2.\n\nThen second part: pos=2 \u2192 result 1.\n\nAnother example where remainder exceeds A:\n\nN=7, A=2, B=3 \u2192 A+B=5 \u22647.\n\nk=1 (5*1=5, remainder 2 \u2192 2 is not >2 \u2192 so pos=2+2=4.\n\nWait, remainder is 2, which is equal to A (2). So else case \u2192 2*1 +2=4.\n\nSecond part: pos=4 \u2192 S(3)=4 \u2192 result 1.\n\nWait, position 4 is the first in block 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example where remainder exceeds A:\n\nN=8, A=2, B=3 \u2192 A+B=5. N=8 \u2192 k=1 (5), remainder 3.\n\n3>2 \u2192 so pos=2*(1+1)=4.\n\nWait, remainder is 3>2 \u2192 yes. So pos=2*(1+1)=4? Wait, 2*(1+1)=4. But the remainder is 3, so the total A's would be 2*1 (from full cycles) plus 2 (since remainder 3 exceeds A=2 \u2192 so A's in remainder is 2 \u2192 total 4. So yes.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code should be as written above, with proper variable declarations and function.\n\nWait, in the first part, the variables k and remainder are local to the first if block. In Fortran, variables can be declared inside the block. Alternatively, declare them before.\n\nIn the code I wrote earlier, inside the first if block, I have:\n\nif (A+B <= N) then\n\n   integer*8 :: k, remainder\n\n   ... \n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside an if block like that. Oh right, that's a mistake. Need to declare variables before.\n\nSo need to adjust that.\n\nSo, in the program:\n\nAfter reading N, A, B, declare variables k and remainder as integer*8.\n\nLike:\n\ninteger*8 :: N, A, B, pos, result, index, start, k, remainder\n\nThen, in the first if block:\n\nif (A+B <= N) then\n\n   k = N/(A+B)\n\n   remainder = mod(N, A+B)\n\n   ... \n\nThus, the corrected code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer*8 :: N, A, B, pos, result, index, start, k, remainder\n\n   read(*,*) N, A, B\n\n   ! Compute pos using first program's logic\n\n   if (A + B <= N) then\n\n      k = N/(A+B)\n\n      remainder = mod(N, A+B)\n\n      if (remainder > A) then\n\n         pos = A*(k+1)\n\n      else\n\n         pos = A*k + remainder\n\n      end if\n\n   else if ( (A + B > N) .and. (A <= N) ) then\n\n      pos = A\n\n   else\n\n      pos = N\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now compute the second part using pos as input\n\n   index =1\n\n   do while (getValue(2*index) < pos)\n\n      index = index *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValue(index+1) <= pos)\n\n      index = index +1\n\n   end do\n\n   start = getValue(index)\n\n   result = pos - start +1\n\n   write(*,*) result\n\ncontains\n\n   integer*8 function getValue(i)\n\n      integer*8, intent(in) :: i\n\n      getValue = 1 + (i*(i-1))/2\n\n   end function getValue\n\nend program main\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, check for possible overflows. Since variables are integer*8, which can handle up to 2^63-1, which is more than 1e18, so it's okay.\n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
