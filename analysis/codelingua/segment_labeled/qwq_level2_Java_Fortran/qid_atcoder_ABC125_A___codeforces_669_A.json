  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (atcoder_ABC125_A):\n\nIt reads three integers: sec, per_num, max_sec. Wait, but the third input is cast to a double and adds 0.5. Wait, looking at the code: the third input is read as an integer, then converted to double and 0.5 is added. So max_sec is (third input) + 0.5. Then, the loop runs from i = sec to less than max_sec, incrementing by sec each time. Each iteration adds per_num to ans_num. The final ans_num is printed.\n\nWait, the loop condition is i < max_sec. Since max_sec is a double, the loop variable i is an integer. So for example, if max_sec is 5.5, then when i reaches 5, the next step would be adding sec (which is the initial sec value, like if sec was 2, then starting at 2, then 4, then 6? Wait, no, the loop starts at sec. Wait, the loop is for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec). So the initial i is sec. So for example, if sec is 3 and max_sec is 5.5, then the first iteration is i=3, which is less than 5.5, so it adds per_num. Then i +=3 becomes 6, which is not less than 5.5, so loop stops. So the loop runs once here. So the loop counts how many multiples of sec (starting from sec itself) are less than max_sec. Each time, adding per_num to the answer.\n\nThe output is the ans_num.\n\nSecond Java file (codeforces_669_A):\n\nIt reads an integer n, then calls solve(n). The solve function computes (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder when divided by 3, else 0. So for example, n=4: 4/3 is 1, remainder 1. So 1*2 +1 =3. Wait, the formula is (n//3)*2 + (if n mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0). Wait the code says (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1). So yes, exactly. So the output is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n%3 !=0 else 0).\n\nNow, the two Java programs are to be run in sequence. The output of the first is the input to the second. So the first program's output (ans_num) is the input to the second program's n. So the overall process is:\n\nInput to first program: three integers (sec, per_num, third_int). The third input is used as (third_int +0.5) in the first program. The first program's output is ans_num, which is then the input to the second program. The second program's output is the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the three integers, compute the first program's result (ans_num), then use that ans_num as the input to the second program's calculation, then output the final result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read the three integers from input. Then compute ans_num as per the first Java program's logic, then compute the second part's result using that ans_num, then print the final result.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read sec, per_num, third_int (the third input is the one that becomes max_sec = third_int +0.5).\n\n2. Compute ans_num:\n\nInitialize ans_num to 0.\n\nLoop i from sec, sec + sec, etc., up to but not exceeding max_sec (which is third_int +0.5).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec). Since i is an integer, and max_sec is a double, the loop runs while i is less than that double. So for example, if max_sec is 5.5, then i can be up to 5 (since 5 <5.5, but 6 would be 6 >=5.5). So the loop counts how many steps of adding sec starting from sec, such that each step's i is less than max_sec.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop can be done with a variable i starting at sec, then adding sec each time, until i < (third_int +0.5). The number of times this happens is the number of iterations, each adding per_num to ans_num.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables can be real for max_sec. Let me think:\n\nmax_sec = third_int + 0.5\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ni starts at sec, then increments by sec each time. The loop continues as long as i < max_sec.\n\nEach iteration adds per_num to ans_num.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, third_int, ans_num, i\nreal :: max_sec\n\nread(*,*) sec, per_num, third_int\nmax_sec = real(third_int) + 0.5\n\nans_num = 0\ni = sec\ndo while (i < max_sec)\n    ans_num = ans_num + per_num\n    i = i + sec\nend do\n\nThen, after that, we need to compute the second part's result using ans_num as n.\n\nThe second part's formula is (ans_num /3)*2 + (1 if mod(ans_num,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with / when both operands are integers. So for example, 4/3 is 1. So (ans_num /3) *2 gives the first part. Then, the remainder: mod(ans_num,3). If mod is 0, add 0, else add 1. So total is (ans_num/3)*2 + (1 if mod(ans_num,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nSo the second part's result is:\n\nresult = (ans_num /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(ans_num,3) /=0 )\n\nAlternatively, can compute it as:\n\ntemp = ans_num /3\nremainder = mod(ans_num,3)\nif (remainder ==0) then\n    add =0\nelse\n    add=1\nend if\nresult = temp*2 + add\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to compute it in one line.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAfter computing ans_num, compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: sec, per_num, third_int, ans_num, i, result\n    real :: max_sec\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) sec, per_num, third_int\n\n    ! Compute first part\n    max_sec = real(third_int) + 0.5\n    ans_num = 0\n    i = sec\n    do while (i < max_sec)\n        ans_num = ans_num + per_num\n        i = i + sec\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute second part using ans_num as n\n    result = (ans_num /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(ans_num,3) /=0 )\n\n    ! Output the result\n    write(*,*) result\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check the second part's formula again. Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the solve function is:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n    System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n}\n\nSo for n=3: 3/3=1, 1*2 +0 =2.\n\nn=4: 4/3=1, 1*2 +1=3.\n\nn=5: 5/3=1, 1*2 +1=3.\n\nn=6:6/3=2 \u2192 2*2 +0=4.\n\nSo the formula is exactly (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, mod(ans_num,3) gives the remainder. So if mod is 0, add 0, else add 1.\n\nThe merge function can be used here. The merge(a,b, condition) returns a if condition is true, else b. So merge(1,0, mod(ans_num,3)/=0) gives 1 when mod is non-zero, else 0. So adding that to (ans_num/3)*2 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, can compute it as:\n\nresult = (ans_num /3)*2 + (1 - (mod(ans_num,3) ==0))\n\nWait, but in Fortran, logical expressions in arithmetic context are .true. = -1, .false. =0. So that might not work. So better to use merge.\n\nAlternatively, compute:\n\nif (mod(ans_num,3) ==0) then\n    add =0\nelse\n    add=1\nend if\nresult = (ans_num/3)*2 + add\n\nBut the merge is more concise.\n\nTesting some examples:\n\nSuppose first program's output is 4 (ans_num=4). Then the second part would compute (4/3)*2 +1 \u2192 1*2 +1=3.\n\nAnother example: ans_num=5 \u2192 (5/3)=1 \u2192 2 +1=3.\n\nans_num=6 \u2192 (6/3)=2 \u21924 +0=4.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, check the first part's loop.\n\nSuppose sec=2, per_num=3, third_int=5. Then max_sec is 5.5.\n\nThe loop starts at i=2. Check 2 <5.5 \u2192 yes. Add 3 \u2192 ans_num=3. Then i becomes 4. 4 <5.5 \u2192 yes. Add another 3 \u2192 ans_num=6. i becomes 6. 6 <5.5? No. So total is 6. Then the second part would be (6/3)*2 \u21924, plus 0 \u21924.\n\nAnother example: sec=3, third_int=5 \u2192 max_sec=5.5. Starting at 3. 3 <5.5 \u2192 yes. Add per_num once. Then i becomes 6, which is over. So ans_num is per_num. Suppose per_num is 5 \u2192 ans_num=5. Then second part gives (5/3)*2 +1 \u2192 3 +1=3*2? Wait 5/3 is 1, so 1*2 +1=3.\n\nWait, 5//3 is 1, so 1*2 is 2, plus 1 gives 3. Correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the loop is implemented correctly. The variables are integers, so i increments correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The loop in Fortran must be a do-while. The do while loop in Fortran is a bit tricky. The syntax is do while (condition), and the loop continues as long as the condition is true. So the code as written is correct.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ni is initialized to sec. Then, the loop checks if i < max_sec. If yes, then execute the loop body (add per_num, then increment i by sec). Then check again. So that's exactly the same as the Java for loop.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: the data types. The max_sec is a real, and i is integer. Comparing integer i with real max_sec is okay in Fortran.\n\nYes, because the comparison is between integer and real, which is allowed.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program."
