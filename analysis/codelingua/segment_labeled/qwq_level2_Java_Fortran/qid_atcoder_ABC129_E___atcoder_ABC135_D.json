  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program's output is the input for the second, so I have to make sure that the Fortran code processes everything in memory without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does. \n\nThe first Java program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string, processes it with a dynamic programming approach, and outputs a number modulo 1e9+7. The DP array here is 2D with dimensions (n+1)x2. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string, processes it with another DP approach, and outputs the count modulo 1e9+7 again, specifically for the 5th state (since it's looking for mod 13 and the target is 5). \n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first. Wait, no, the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input for the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string input (since it reads with sc.next().toCharArray()). So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second program. \n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input string for the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, I need to first read the input string (the original input to the first Java program), process it through the first algorithm, get the result (the number), then use that number as the input string for the second algorithm, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input string (for the first Java program).\n2. Process it through the first algorithm (the DP in the first Java code), getting a number (mod 1e9+7).\n3. Convert that number into a string (since the second Java program expects a string input).\n4. Process that string through the second algorithm (the DP in the second Java code), getting the final result (mod 1e9+7 again, but specifically for the 5th state).\n5. Output that final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial input string (from stdin).\n- Compute the first DP and get the first result (the sum of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1] mod M).\n- Convert that result into a string (so that it can be used as the input for the second part).\n- Then process that string through the second DP algorithm.\n- Finally, output the result of the second DP.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first Java program's variables:\n\n- M is 1e9+7 (1000000007)\n- s is the input string as a char array.\n- n is the length of s.\n- dp is a 2D array of size (n+1)x2.\n\nThe loops in the first Java code:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] = 1, others 0.\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nDepending on s[i], update dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe first loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        dp[i + 1][0] = dp[i][0];\n        dp[i + 1][1] = dp[i][1];\n    } else {\n        dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n    }\n    // Then another block:\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n    } else {\n        dp[i + 1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i + 1][0] %= M;\n        dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n    }\n}\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complex. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst part of the loop (the first if-else):\n\nIf the current character is '0', then the next dp's 0 and 1 are same as current. Else, the next 1 is sum of current 0 and 1 mod M.\n\nThen, the second part (another if-else):\n\nIf the character is '0', then add (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], mod M.\n\nElse, add (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], then mod both.\n\nWait, but the order here is important. Let me see:\n\nWait, the first part of the loop (the first if-else) sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part adds to those values?\n\nWait, the code structure is:\n\nFirst, in the first if-else block, they set the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]. Then, in the second if-else block, they add more to those values.\n\nWait, for example, if the character is '0', then in the first block, dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]. Then, in the second block (since s[i] is '0'), they add (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], then mod.\n\nWait, but the first part of the code (the first if-else) is separate from the second part. So the code is structured as:\n\nfor each i:\n\n   first part (the first if-else) sets some values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]\n\n   then, the second part (another if-else) modifies those values further.\n\nWait, but in code:\n\nThe first part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n}\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M\n    mod again\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M\n    mod both\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, for the else case (s[i] is not '0'), the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? Or is it that the first part only sets the first part, and the second part adds to it?\n\nWait, in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first block sets both dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the current's values. Then, in the second part, if s[i] is '0', it adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. So the first part's assignments are overwritten?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose s[i] is '0':\n\nFirst part: set dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so the new value is (dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2)) mod M \u2192 3*dp[i][1] mod M?\n\nWait, but the first part's assignment is to set dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1], then the second part adds (dp[i][1] *2) to it. So the total becomes dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2) mod M?\n\nWait, but the code is:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M \u2192 no, that's only in the else part of the first block.\n\nWait, the first block's else is when s[i] is not '0', so the first block's else sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? Or is it that the first block's else only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0?\n\nWait, the code for the first block's else is only setting dp[i+1][1], and leaving dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? That can't be right. Because in the first block's else, the code only sets dp[i+1][1], but the first part of the code (the first block) may not set dp[i+1][0], so that would be undefined. Wait, but in Java, arrays are initialized to 0, so maybe the first block's else leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the code for the first block (the first if-else):\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nSo in the else case (s[i] is not '0'), the first block only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before. Since the array is initialized to 0, then dp[i+1][0] would be 0 in that case?\n\nWait, but in Java, when you create a new int array, all elements are initialized to 0. So the dp array is initialized to all zeros. So for each step, before the first block, the dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] are 0. Then, in the first block, if s[i] is '0', then they are set to dp[i][0] and dp[i][1]. Else, only dp[i+1][1] is set to (sum mod M), and dp[i+1][0] remains 0.\n\nThen, the second part of the code (the second if-else) comes in.\n\nSo for the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0'):\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so adding to the existing value (from first block's first case, which was dp[i][1])\n\n    then mod again.\n\nElse:\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 adding to the existing value (which was 0 from first block's else case)\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 adding to the existing value (from first block's else case, which was (sum mod M))\n\n    then mod both.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to restructure the code to see the steps.\n\nLet me think of the first part and second part as separate steps.\n\nFirst part (first if-else):\n\nCase 1: s[i] is '0'\n\n- dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n- dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nCase 2: else (s[i] is not '0')\n\n- dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\n- dp[i+1][0] remains 0 (since it wasn't set here)\n\nSecond part (second if-else):\n\nCase 1: s[i] is '0'\n\n- add (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1]\n\n- then mod again.\n\nCase 2: else (s[i] is not '0')\n\n- add (dp[i][0] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][0]\n\n- add (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1]\n\n- then mod both.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each i:\n\nInitialize dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to 0 (since arrays are initialized to 0).\n\nThen first part:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n   set dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   set dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n   set dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, second part:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so total becomes (dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2)) mod M \u2192 3*dp[i][1] mod M?\n\nWait, but the first part already set dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1], so adding (dp[i][1] *2) gives 3*dp[i][1] mod M.\n\nElse (s[i] not '0'):\n\n   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 since first part set dp[i+1][0] to 0, now it's (dp[i][0] *2 mod M)\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 the first part set it to (sum mod M), so adding (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) \u2192 total is (sum + 2*dp[i][1]) mod M \u2192 (dp[i][0] + 3 dp[i][1]) mod M?\n\nWait, but the first part's else case set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M. Then adding (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) gives (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1] + 2 dp[i][1]) mod M \u2192 dp[i][0] + 3 dp[i][1] mod M.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should re-express the code in terms of the two steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to combine the two parts into a single step for each condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written in a way that for each character, the transitions are computed in a way that combines both parts.\n\nBut for the purpose of translating to Fortran, I need to make sure that the logic is correctly captured.\n\nNow, moving on to the second Java program (atcoder_ABC135_D):\n\nThis program reads a string (cs) and processes it with a DP array of size [cs.length][13], tracking mod 13 values.\n\nThe base variable is initialized to 1, and for each character (processed in reverse order?), the DP is updated.\n\nWait, the code loops over i from 0 to cs.length-1, but the character is taken as cs[cs.length-1 -i], which is the reverse order. So the first character processed is the last character of the input string, then the second to last, etc. So the processing is from the end of the string towards the start.\n\nThe DP[i][...] represents the state after processing the first i+1 characters (since the loop is from 0 to length-1). The base is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each step, which is part of the calculation for the current digit's contribution.\n\nThe code uses a DP approach where for each position, and for each possible previous mod value (pre), it calculates the new mod value when adding the current digit (or all possible digits if it's a '?').\n\nThe target is to find the number of ways the entire number mod 13 is 5, so the final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5].\n\nWait, the code's final output is dp[dp.length-1][5], which is the last index (since dp.length is the length of the input string). So the last index is the full length, so the final state after processing all characters.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 13. So for each step, the current digit's contribution is (digit * base) mod 13, added to the previous mod.\n\nWait, the way the DP is updated is:\n\nFor each previous mod value (pre), and for each possible next digit (0-9 or only the given digit if not '?'), the new mod is (base * next + pre) mod 13. The base is 10^i mod 13, since each step multiplies by 10.\n\nWait, the base is initialized to 1, and after each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So for the first step (i=0), the current digit is the last character of the input string. The base is 1, so the contribution is next * 1. Then, for the next step (i=1), the base is 10 mod 13, so the next digit (second to last) contributes next * 10, etc. So the total is the sum of each digit * 10^position mod 13, where position is the number of digits after it.\n\nThis is the standard way to compute the mod 13 of a number's digits processed from right to left.\n\nThe DP[i][new_mod] += the number of ways to reach pre mod before adding this digit's contribution.\n\nThe initial condition is that for the first step (i=0, processing the last character), if it's a '?', then for each possible digit (0-9), we add the possibilities. The initial count for pre=0 is 1 (since before processing any digits, the mod is 0).\n\nWait, in the code, for the first step (i=0), when processing the first character (the last of the input string), the initial pre is 0, so the count starts as 1.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program):\n\nWe need to read the input string, process it with the DP, get the result, then pass that as a string to the second part.\n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n2. Process the first DP:\n\n   - Initialize variables: M = 1000000007.\n\n   - Convert the input string to an array of characters (Fortran strings are arrays of characters).\n\n   - n is the length of the string.\n\n   - Allocate a 2D array dp(n+1, 2). Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based by declaring from 0 to n.\n\n   Wait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound. So perhaps declare dp(0:n, 0:1) to match the Java's indices.\n\n   Initialize dp(0,0) = 1, dp(0,1) = 0.\n\n   Then loop over each character in the string (from 1 to n, since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran, perhaps 1-based).\n\n   Wait, the original Java code uses 0-based indices for the string. So in Fortran, the string can be stored as a character array with indices 1 to n, so s(1) is the first character.\n\n   So for each i from 1 to n (Java's i from 0 to n-1):\n\n   current_char = s(i)\n\n   Then, process according to the first part's logic.\n\n   Let me think of the steps for each i (Java's i is 0-based, so in Fortran, i runs from 1 to n):\n\n   For each i in 1 to n:\n\n      current_char = s(i)\n\n      first part:\n\n      if current_char == '0' then:\n\n          dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n          dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n      else:\n\n          dp(i,1) = (dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1)) mod M\n\n      end if\n\n      second part:\n\n      if current_char == '0' then:\n\n          dp(i,1) = (dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2) ) mod M\n\n      else:\n\n          dp(i,0) = (dp(i,0) + (dp(i-1,0)*2) ) mod M\n\n          dp(i,1) = (dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2) ) mod M\n\n      end if\n\n      Then, after both parts, mod both dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) by M again?\n\n      Wait, in the Java code, after the second part's additions, they mod again. For example, in the first part's else case, after setting dp[i+1][1], then in the second part's else case, after adding the terms, they mod both.\n\n      So in the code:\n\n      For the second part's else case:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 but in code, it's written as (dp[i][0] *2) mod M added to dp[i+1][0], then mod again.\n\n      Wait, in Java, the code does:\n\n          dp[i + 1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n          dp[i + 1][0] %= M;\n\n      So the addition is done with mod M, but then the total is modded again.\n\n      So in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n      For the second part's else case:\n\n          temp0 = (dp(i-1,0)*2) mod M\n\n          dp(i,0) = dp(i,0) + temp0\n\n          dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0), M)\n\n          temp1 = (dp(i-1,1)*2) mod M\n\n          dp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + temp1\n\n          dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1), M)\n\n      Or perhaps better to compute the additions first, then mod.\n\n      Alternatively, in code:\n\n      For the second part's else case:\n\n          dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + (dp(i-1,0)*2), M )\n\n          dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2), M )\n\n      Because in Java, the code does:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) % M \u2192 but since the mod is applied to the term before adding, but the total is modded again.\n\n      Wait, in Java, the code is:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n          dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n      So the addition is of (dp[i][0]*2 mod M), then mod again. So the total is (previous value + (term mod M)) mod M.\n\n      Which is equivalent to (previous + term) mod M, since adding mod M terms.\n\n      So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\n          dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + (dp(i-1,0)*2), M )\n\n          similarly for the others.\n\n      So putting it all together:\n\n      For each i from 1 to n:\n\n          current_char = s(i)\n\n          first part:\n\n          if current_char == '0' then:\n\n              dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n              dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n          else:\n\n              dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n          end if\n\n          second part:\n\n          if current_char == '0' then:\n\n              dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2), M )\n\n          else:\n\n              dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + (dp(i-1,0)*2), M )\n\n              dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2), M )\n\n          end if\n\n      Wait, but in the first part's else case, the first part sets dp(i,1) to (sum mod M), but the second part's else case adds (dp(i-1,0)*2) to dp(i,0) (which was 0 from first part's else case?), and adds (dp(i-1,1)*2) to dp(i,1).\n\n      Wait, in the first part's else case (current_char not '0'), the first part sets dp(i,1) to (sum mod M), and leaves dp(i,0) as 0 (since in the first part's else, only dp[i+1][1] is set, and dp[i+1][0] remains 0 from initialization? Wait, in Fortran, the array is initialized to 0, so before the first part, dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) are 0. Then, in the first part's else case, dp(i,1) is set to (sum mod M), and dp(i,0) remains 0. Then, in the second part's else case, we add (dp(i-1,0)*2) to dp(i,0) (which is 0 + ...). So that's okay.\n\n      So the code should work as above.\n\n      After processing all characters, the result is (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod M.\n\n      So that's the first part's output.\n\n      Now, the second part's input is this number as a string. So we need to convert the result into a string, then process it through the second DP.\n\n      So in Fortran, after computing the first result, we need to convert it to a string. Let's see:\n\n      The first result is (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod M. Let's call this value first_result.\n\n      Then, we need to convert first_result to a string. Since it can be up to 1e9+7, which is 10 digits, so the string will be up to 10 characters.\n\n      In Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read, or using internal writes.\n\n      For example:\n\n      write (string, '(I0)') first_result\n\n      Then, the string will be the digits of first_result. But we need to make sure that leading zeros are not present? Or does the second Java program expect the number as a string with leading zeros? Wait, the second Java program reads the input as a string, so if the first result is, say, 5, then the input to the second program is \"5\".\n\n      So in Fortran, the string should be the decimal representation of first_result, without leading zeros except for zero itself.\n\n      So using write with '(I0)' should handle that.\n\n      Once we have the string, we can process it through the second DP.\n\n      Now, the second part's DP:\n\n      The second program's variables:\n\n      - MOD is 1e9+7 (same as M in first part).\n\n      - The input is a string (the first_result's string).\n\n      - The DP array is of size [length][13], where length is the length of the input string.\n\n      - The base starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13.\n\n      The processing is done in reverse order of the string's characters (from last to first).\n\n      So in Fortran:\n\n      Let's denote the input string as s2 (the string representation of first_result).\n\n      n2 = len_trim(s2)\n\n      Allocate a 2D array dp(0:n2-1, 0:12) (since in Java it's 0-based for the first dimension, but in Fortran, perhaps 0 to n2-1 for the first index).\n\n      Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i), and the character is taken as cs[cs.length-1 -i]. So for i from 0 to n2-1, the character is the (n2-1 -i)th character of s2 (since in Java, indices are 0-based). So in Fortran, if s2 is a character array of length n2, then the characters are s2(1) to s2(n2). So the first character processed is s2(n2), then s2(n2-1), etc.\n\n      So for each i from 0 to n2-1 (Fortran's loop variable can be 1 to n2, but perhaps better to use 0-based here):\n\n      current_char = s2(n2 - i) \u2192 Wait, let's see:\n\n      In Java, for i in 0 to n2-1:\n\n          index_in_s = cs.length -1 -i \u2192 which is (n2-1 -i). So in Fortran, the character is s2(n2 -i) (since Fortran is 1-based). Wait, no:\n\n      Let me think:\n\n      Suppose the string is \"123\", then in Fortran, s2(1) = '1', s2(2) = '2', s2(3) = '3'. The length is 3.\n\n      For i=0 (Java's first iteration), the character is s[2] (since 3-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 index 2 in 0-based, which is '3' in Fortran's s2(3)).\n\n      So in Fortran, the character is s2(n2 - i) \u2192 for i from 0 to n2-1:\n\n          char = s2(n2 - i)\n\n      Wait, when i=0: n2 -0 = n2 \u2192 s2(n2) \u2192 correct.\n\n      When i=1: n2 -1 \u2192 s2(n2-1), etc.\n\n      So yes, that's correct.\n\n      Now, the DP array in Fortran can be declared as dp(0:n2-1, 0:12). Since in Java it's [cs.length][13], which is 0-based.\n\n      The base starts at 1, and after each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13.\n\n      The initial condition for the DP is that for i=0 (the first step, processing the last character of the input string), the DP is initialized based on the previous state (i-1, but for i=0, it's the first step).\n\n      The code in Java loops over each i from 0 to n2-1:\n\n          if the current character is '?', then loop over all possible digits (0-9) and update the DP.\n\n          else, use the digit from the character.\n\n          For each possible previous mod (pre from 0 to 12):\n\n              compute next_digit (either 0-9 or the given digit)\n\n              new_mod = (base * next_digit + pre) mod 13\n\n              dp[i][new_mod] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ? 1 :0))\n\n              mod by MOD.\n\n      So in Fortran:\n\n      Initialize base = 1.\n\n      For each i from 0 to n2-1:\n\n          current_char = s2(n2 - i)\n\n          if current_char == '?' then:\n\n              do next_digit = 0 to 9:\n\n                  ... process each digit.\n\n          else:\n\n              next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n          end if\n\n          Wait, but in the code, for each possible next_digit (if '?'), or the single digit otherwise, we need to loop over all pre and compute the new_mod.\n\n          So in Fortran, for each i:\n\n              current_char = s2(n2 - i)\n\n              if (current_char == '?') then\n\n                  do next_digit = 0,9\n\n                      do pre = 0,12\n\n                          new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                          if (i ==0) then\n\n                              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + 1  (since when i=0, previous is i-1 = -1, so the initial condition is pre==0 ? 1 :0 )\n\n                          else\n\n                              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                          end if\n\n                          dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n\n                      end do\n\n                  end do\n\n              else\n\n                  next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n                  do pre =0,12\n\n                      new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                      if (i ==0) then\n\n                          dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (1 if pre ==0 else 0)\n\n                      else\n\n                          dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                      end if\n\n                      dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n\n                  end do\n\n              end if\n\n              base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\n          end do\n\n      Wait, but in the Java code, the DP is initialized for each i. Wait, in Java, the DP array is initialized to 0, and for each i, the code loops over all pre and next_digit (if applicable) and adds to the new_mod's count.\n\n      So in Fortran, the DP array should be initialized to 0 before starting the loop. Then, for each i, the code loops over all possible next_digits (if '?'), and for each pre, computes the new_mod and adds the previous count (or 1 if i=0 and pre is 0).\n\n      So the steps are:\n\n      Initialize dp to 0.\n\n      For each i from 0 to n2-1:\n\n          current_char = s2(n2 -i)\n\n          if current_char is '?', then loop over next_digit 0-9.\n\n          else, next_digit is fixed.\n\n          For each next_digit (either 0-9 or the single value):\n\n              loop over pre from 0 to 12:\n\n                  compute new_mod = (base * next_digit + pre) mod 13\n\n                  contribution = dp(i-1, pre) if i>0 else (1 if pre ==0 else 0)\n\n                  dp(i, new_mod) += contribution\n\n                  mod by MOD.\n\n          After processing all next_digits and pres, update base.\n\n      Wait, but in the code, for each next_digit, the loops over pre and adds to the new_mod. So for each next_digit, the code must process all pre and add the contribution.\n\n      So in Fortran, the loops would be:\n\n      For each i in 0 to n2-1:\n\n          current_char = s2(n2 -i)\n\n          if (current_char == '?') then\n\n              do next_digit =0,9\n\n                  do pre =0,12\n\n                      new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                      if (i ==0) then\n\n                          contribution = 1 if pre ==0 else 0\n\n                      else\n\n                          contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                      end if\n\n                      dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n\n                      dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n\n                  end do\n\n              end do\n\n          else\n\n              next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n              do pre =0,12\n\n                  new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                  if (i ==0) then\n\n                      contribution = 1 if pre ==0 else 0\n\n                  else\n\n                      contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                  end if\n\n                  dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n\n                  dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n\n              end do\n\n          end if\n\n          base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\n      end do\n\n      Wait, but in the Java code, the loops are structured as:\n\n      for each pre in 0..12:\n\n          for each next_digit (if '?') or the single digit:\n\n              compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod]\n\n      So in the code above, for each next_digit, we loop over all pre. But in the case of '?', we have to loop over all next_digits and for each, loop over all pre. So the code above is correct.\n\n      However, in Fortran, the order of loops may affect performance, but since the problem size is small (n2 up to 10 digits, and 13 mods), it's manageable.\n\n      After processing all i, the result is dp(n2-1,5) mod MOD.\n\n      So putting all together:\n\n      The Fortran program will:\n\n      1. Read the input string (the first input to the first Java program).\n\n      2. Process it through the first DP to get first_result.\n\n      3. Convert first_result to a string s2.\n\n      4. Process s2 through the second DP to get the final result.\n\n      5. Output the final result.\n\n      Now, handling the string conversion in Fortran:\n\n      To convert the first_result (integer) to a string:\n\n      We can use an internal write statement.\n\n      For example:\n\n      integer :: first_result\n\n      character(len=20) :: s2\n\n      write(s2, '(I0)') first_result\n\n      s2 = adjustl(s2)  ! To remove leading spaces\n\n      n2 = len_trim(s2)\n\n      Then, s2(1:n2) contains the digits.\n\n      Now, the DP arrays:\n\n      For the first DP:\n\n      integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\n      integer :: n, i\n\n      character(len=100) :: s  ! Assuming input string is up to 100 characters (as in the first Java program's problem constraints?)\n\n      integer, dimension(0:100, 0:1) :: dp1\n\n      (But need to adjust the size based on the input length.)\n\n      Wait, but in Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\n      So perhaps:\n\n      read *, s  \u2192 but in Fortran, reading a string can be done with read(*, '(A)') s.\n\n      Then, n = len_trim(s)\n\n      allocate(dp1(0:n, 0:1))\n\n      Similarly for the second DP.\n\n      Now, putting all together in code.\n\n      Let me outline the steps in code:\n\n      program main\n\n          implicit none\n\n          integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\n          character(len=100) :: input_str\n\n          integer :: n, i, first_result\n\n          character(len=20) :: s2\n\n          integer :: n2, MOD = M\n\n          integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp1, dp2\n\n          !

But in the code above, the mod is applied to the term before adding. But in the Java code, the code is:\n\n          dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n          dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n      So the total is (previous + (term mod M)) mod M, which is equivalent to (previous + term) mod M.\n\n      So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to compute:\n\n          temp = (dp1(i-1,0)*2) mod M\n\n          dp1(i,0) = dp1(i,0) + temp\n\n          dp1(i,0) = mod(dp1(i,0), M)\n\n      But the code above uses mod( a + mod(b, M), M ), which is the same as mod(a + b, M).\n\n      So the code is okay.\n\n      Another point: in the second part's loops, when c is '?', we loop over next_digit from 0 to 9, and for each, loop over pre 0-12.\n\n      The contribution is added for each next_digit and pre.\n\n      The code should handle that correctly.\n\n      Also, in the second part's initial condition (i=0), the contribution is 1 if pre is 0, else 0.\n\n      The code uses 1*(pre ==0), which in Fortran is 1 when pre is 0, else 0. That's correct.\n\n      The final result is dp2(n2-1,5) mod MOD. Since MOD is already 1e9+7, mod again is redundant but safe.\n\n      Now, testing for possible errors:\n\n      - The first part's DP indices: in Fortran, the first dimension is from 0 to n, which matches the Java's 0-based.\n\n      - The second part's DP is 0-based for the first dimension (i from 0 to n2-1).\n\n      - The base starts at 1, and is updated after each step.\n\n      - The character extraction for the second part: s2(n2 -i : n2 -i) \u2192 since s2 is a string, s2(1) is the first character. For i=0, it's s2(n2), which is the last character of the string. Correct.\n\n      Now, possible issues:\n\n      1. The first_result may be zero, so the string s2 would be \"0\", which is handled correctly.\n\n      2. The second part's DP array must be initialized to zero before each step. Since in Fortran, the allocation sets all elements to zero, but in the loop, for each i, the dp2(i, :) is being added to. Wait, no: in the code above, the dp2 array is initialized to zero before the loop. Then, for each i, the code loops over all next_digits and pre, and adds contributions to dp2(i, new_mod). So for each i, the dp2(i, :) starts at zero, and the contributions are added. That's correct.\n\n      Wait, no. Because in the code:\n\n          allocate(dp2(0:n2-1, 0:12))\n\n          dp2 = 0\n\n          do i =0 to n2-1:\n\n              ... for each next_digit and pre:\n\n                  dp2(i, new_mod) += contribution\n\n      So yes, each i's row starts at zero, and contributions are added. That's correct.\n\n      Another possible issue: in the second part's loop over pre from 0 to 12, and next_digit, the code may have to loop over all pre for each next_digit. But that's correct.\n\n      So this code should work.\n\n      Now, some minor adjustments:\n\n      In the first part's loop, the character is read as input_str(i:i). Since input_str is read with '(A)', it may have trailing spaces, but len_trim is used, so the actual length is n.\n\n      Also, in the second part's string conversion, the s2 is written with '(I0)', which should give the correct numeric string.\n\n      The final print statement outputs the final_result.\n\n      So this should be the correct Fortran code."
