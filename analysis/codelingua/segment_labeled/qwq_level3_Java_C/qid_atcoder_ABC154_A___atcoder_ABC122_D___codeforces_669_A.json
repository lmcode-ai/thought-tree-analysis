Let's see:\n\nEach character is a digit in base4. The first character (leftmost) is the first of the three, so the value is (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + c3. So for \"TTT\", it's 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 3*(24) +3 = 75?

Also, in the code, when N is 0, the loop for current would start at -1, which is invalid. So need to add a check for N=0. Let me think: if N is 0, then the result is dp[0][63]. But according to the DP initialization, when N=0, the base case is when current reaches 0 (since N=0, the base case is when current ==0, so the initial setup would be different. Hmm, perhaps the code should handle N=0 as a special case. Alternatively, in the code, when N is 0, the loop for current starts at N-1 = -1, which is skipped, so the DP for current=0 is not computed. So the code would have an error. To fix this, the loop should be:\n\n          if (N ==0) {\n\n              // then current starts at 0?\n\n              // but the base case is when current ==0, so the initial setup is dp[0] [*] =1?\n\n              // Wait, the base case is when current == N (which is 0), so dp[0][last3] =1 for all last3.\n\n              // So the result is dp[0][63], which is 1.\n\n              // So the code would work.\n\n          } But in the code above, when N=0, the loop for current runs from -1 down to 0, which is not entered.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC154_A) reads three lines of input. The first line is split into an array, the second line gives two integers a and b, and the third line is a string u. It checks if u equals the first part of the first line. If so, it outputs a-1 and b; else, a and b-1. So the output here is two integers separated by space.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC122_D) is a dynamic programming problem. It reads an integer N and calculates some value using memoization, returning a result modulo 1e9+7. The output here is a single number.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n, computes (n divided by 3 times 2) plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0. So it's like ceiling(n/3)*2 - something? Wait, let me see: (n//3)*2 + (1 if n%3 !=0 else 0). For example, n=4: 4/3 is 1, so 2 +1=3. Wait, 4/3 is 1.333, so floor division gives 1, so 2 +1=3. The formula is correct.\n\nNow, the sequence is: the output of the first Java program is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third. Wait, but how exactly? Let me think.\n\nWait, the first program's output is two integers. The second program expects an integer N as input. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. The first program's output is used as input to the second, but the second program expects a single integer N. So perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program is expecting a single number. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking back at the first Java program's output: it prints two integers separated by space. The second Java program's input is a single integer N. So how does that work? The first program's output is two numbers, but the second program expects a single number. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but maybe the second program's input is the first program's output? Wait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third.\n\nBut the first program's output is two numbers. The second program expects a single integer N. So that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem setup. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's output: it's either (a-1) and b, or a and (b-1). So the output is two integers. The second program's input is N, which is read via in.nextInt(). So the second program expects a single integer. Therefore, the first program's output (two numbers) can't be the input to the second. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is a single number? Let me check the first Java code again. The first program's output is:\n\nSystem.out.println(u.equals(str[0]) ? (a - 1) + \" \" + b : a + \" \" + (b - 1));\n\nSo it's two numbers separated by space. So the second program must read that as its input. But the second program's code starts with Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); N = in.nextInt(); So the second program is expecting an integer N. So the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program is expecting a single integer. That can't be. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's input? No, the user said the output of each is input to the next. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a single number? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's first line is split into a string array. Let's see:\n\nThe first line is read as str = in.readLine().split(\" \");. So that's splitting on spaces. Then the second line is read via StringTokenizer, which splits into a and b. The third line is u. Then the output is either (a-1) and b, or a and (b-1). So the output is two numbers separated by space. So the second program must read that as its input. But the second program's input is N, which is a single integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a single number. Wait, no, the code clearly outputs two numbers. Hmm. Maybe the second program is supposed to read the first number of the two? Like, the first number is N? But that would require the second program to read the first number. But the code for the second program uses in.nextInt() which would read the first token. So perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, and the second program takes the first as N. But then the second number is unused. That might be possible. Let me see the problem's description again.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second's output is the input to the third. So the first's output must be the input to the second. So the second program must read its input from the first's output. But the second program expects an integer N. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But according to the code, it's two numbers. So this is a problem. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is a single number. Let me check again. The first program's output is either (a-1) + \" \" + b or a + \" \" + (b-1). So two numbers. So the second program must read that as its input. But the second program's code reads N as in.nextInt(). So the first number would be read as N, and the second is left in the input buffer. But the second program doesn't care about the second number. So perhaps that's acceptable. The second program's input is the first number of the first program's output, and the second number is ignored. That's possible. So the second program's N is the first number from the first program's output. The second number is not used. Then the second program's output is a single number, which is the input to the third program. The third program takes that number and processes it.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output: two numbers, say X Y.\n\nSecond program reads X as N, and ignores Y. Then computes its result, say Z.\n\nThird program takes Z as input, computes the formula, and outputs the result.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input, process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three Java programs into a single C program that does the same steps without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (three lines).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to get X Y.\n\n3. Use X as the input to the second program's logic (ignoring Y, since the second program only takes N).\n\n4. Compute the second program's result Z.\n\n5. Use Z as the input to the third program's logic.\n\n6. Output the third program's result.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is N, which is the first number from the first program's output. So the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only takes the first. So the second program's N is the first number of the first program's output. The second number is irrelevant for the second program.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the first step is to read the three lines of input for the first Java program, process them to get X and Y, then take X as N for the second program, compute the second program's result Z, then pass Z to the third program's logic, and output the result.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is a dynamic programming problem. Let me see what it does. The second program's code is for a problem where you count the number of valid strings of length N, avoiding certain substrings, modulo 1e9+7. The first program's output's first number is X, which is either a-1 or a, depending on the condition. So the second program's N is X. The second program's output is Z, which is the count. Then the third program takes Z and computes (Z /3)*2 + (1 if Z mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nWait, but the third program's input is an integer n, which comes from the second program's output. So the third program's input is Z, which is the output of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the first three lines as per the first Java program.\n\n- Compute X and Y (the first program's output).\n\n- Take X as N for the second program's logic.\n\n- Compute Z (the second program's output).\n\n- Compute the third program's result based on Z.\n\n- Output that result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate all three Java programs into C code, connected in this way, with only the first part reading input, and the last part outputting the final result.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in C.\n\nFirst program's steps:\n\nRead first line: split into str array (split on space). But in C, we can read the entire line, then split into tokens. But since the first line is split into an array, but the only use is to compare u to str[0]. So perhaps the first line is just a string, split into parts, but only the first part is needed. Wait, the code in the first Java program does:\n\nString[] str = in.readLine().split(\" \");\n\nThen, the third line is u. Then, check if u.equals(str[0]). So the first part of the first line (split on space) is compared to u.\n\nSo in C, we can read the first line, split into tokens (using strtok or similar), and store the first token as the first part. Then, the second line is two integers a and b. The third line is the string u.\n\nSo in C:\n\nRead first line: let's say first_line is a buffer. Split into tokens, first token is str0.\n\nRead second line: read two integers a and b.\n\nRead third line: read u.\n\nThen compute:\n\nif (u == str0) then output a-1 and b, else a and b-1.\n\nSo the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only uses the first number (X = a-1 or a, depending on condition).\n\nSo in C code, after processing the first part, we can compute X and Y, but only X is needed for the second step.\n\nNow, the second program's logic is the dynamic programming part. The second Java program's code is a bit complex. Let's see:\n\nThe second program's code uses memoization with a map for each step. The problem is to count the number of valid strings of length N, avoiding certain substrings like \"AGC\" and some permutations.\n\nThe code uses a recursive approach with memoization. The key is the last three characters, and current length. The base case is when current reaches N, return 1.\n\nThe function isOK checks if adding a new character would create an invalid substring. The function dfs builds the string step by step, keeping track of the last three characters to check validity.\n\nTranslating this into C requires implementing memoization. Since Java uses a Map<String, Long> for each step, in C, we can represent the memo as a 2D array or use a hash table. However, since the possible last3 strings are limited (only 4^3 = 64 possibilities), we can represent them as a 4-digit number where each digit is 0-3 (since the tokens are \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\").\n\nAlternatively, we can map each possible 3-character string to an integer. For example, each character can be represented as 0 (A), 1 (C), 2 (G), 3 (T). So the last3 can be stored as a 3-digit number in base 4, giving a value between 0 and 63. This way, the memo can be an array of size (N+1) * 64, but since N can be up to maybe 1e5? Wait, looking at the problem constraints for ABC122_D, the N can be up to 1e5? Wait, the problem statement for ABC122_D is probably the one where N can be up to 1e5 or similar. Wait, but in the code, the memo is an array of N+1 elements, each being a map. For N=1e5, that would be 1e5+1 maps, each with 64 entries. But in C, using an array of arrays might be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible last3 strings are 4^3=64, for each current length (up to N), and each of the 64 possible last3 strings, we can store the count. So the memo can be a 2D array: memo[current][last3_code], where last3_code is 0-63.\n\nThis way, the memo can be represented as a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64. Since N can be up to, say, 1e5, but in the problem's constraints, perhaps N is up to 2000? Wait, looking at the problem ABC122_D, the constraints for N are probably up to 1e5, but the code uses memoization with recursion. Wait, but in the code, the recursion might be too slow for large N. However, the problem's constraints might allow for a DP approach with O(N * 64) time, which is manageable even for N=1e5.\n\nWait, the problem's constraints for ABC122_D: looking it up, the problem is \"AGC\", and the constraints are N up to 1e5. So the code in Java uses memoization with recursion, but for N=1e5, that would be a stack overflow. Wait, but the code uses memoization with a bottom-up approach? Or is it top-down with memoization?\n\nWait, the code uses a recursive approach with memoization. For N=1e5, the recursion depth would be 1e5, which would cause stack overflow. So perhaps the problem's actual constraints are smaller. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for a DP approach with iterative loops.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's actual constraints are N up to 1e5, but the code uses memoization with a top-down approach. However, in C, recursion might not be feasible for large N. So perhaps we need to reimplement the DP in an iterative way.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem's DP approach.\n\nThe state is (current length, last three characters). The transitions are adding a new character, ensuring that the new four-character substring (last three plus new) doesn't contain \"AGC\" and that swapping any two adjacent characters in the four-character substring doesn't create \"AGC\".\n\nThe isOK function checks two conditions:\n\n1. The last four characters (last3 + new_char) must not contain \"AGC\".\n\n2. For each of the first three positions in the four-character string, swapping the i-th and (i+1)-th characters and checking if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code's isOK function:\n\n- Checks if the last4 contains \"AGC\".\n\n- Then, for each i from 0 to 2, swaps the i and i+1 characters in the last4 string, and checks if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these are true, the new character is invalid.\n\nSo the new character is allowed only if none of these conditions are met.\n\nThe DP approach can be implemented with memoization. Since the possible last3 strings are 4^3=64, and N can be up to 1e5, the total states are 1e5 * 64 = 6.4e6, which is manageable with an array.\n\nSo in C, we can represent the memo as a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64, where each entry holds the count modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe base case is when current == N, the count is 1.\n\nThe transitions are for each possible next character (A, C, G, T), check if adding it is allowed, then add the result of the next state.\n\nWe can implement this with an iterative DP approach, starting from current = N down to 0, or building up from 0 to N.\n\nWait, let's think of it as building up from 0 to N.\n\nInitialize memo[0][...] as 0 except for the initial state. Wait, the initial state is the first three characters. Wait, the initial last3 is \"TTT\" as per the code's dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"). So the starting last3 is \"TTT\", and current is 0. The base case is when current reaches N, so the length is N.\n\nWait, the current is the current length of the string. So when current is 0, the string has 0 characters, but the last3 is \"TTT\" (maybe as a placeholder? Or perhaps the first three characters are being built up. Hmm, perhaps the initial last3 is \"TTT\" to handle the first few steps.\n\nWait, the code's dfs starts with last3 being \"TTT\", and current is 0. So the first step is to add a character, making the last3 the first character plus the next two? Not sure. Anyway, the code's logic is that the last3 is the last three characters of the current string. So when current is 0, the string is empty, but the last3 is \"TTT\" as an initial value. That might be a way to handle the first few steps where the string is shorter than 3 characters. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses \"TTT\" as a dummy to start, and as the string grows, the last three are tracked properly.\n\nIn any case, the DP can be implemented with an array.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the DP in C:\n\nWe can represent the last3 as a 3-character string, but in C, it's easier to map each possible 3-character combination to an integer (like 0-63). Let's assign each character to a number: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3. Then, the last3 can be represented as a 3-digit number in base4, e.g., for \"AGC\", it would be 0*16 + 2*4 + 1 = 9 (since A is 0, G is 2, C is 1). Wait, but the order is important. Let's see:\n\nEach character is a digit in base4. The first character (leftmost) is the first of the three, so the value is (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + c3. So for \"TTT\", it's 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 3*(24) +3 = 75? Wait 3*16 is 48, 3*4 is 12, plus 3: total 63. So \"TTT\" is 333 in base4, which is 3*(4^2) + 3*4 +3 = 3*(16+4+1) = 3*21=63.\n\nSo the code can represent the last3 as an integer between 0 and 63.\n\nThe DP array can be a 2D array: dp[current][last3_code], where current ranges from 0 to N, and last3_code is 0-63.\n\nThe initial state is dp[0][63] = 1 (since the starting last3 is \"TTT\" (code 63) and current is 0, but the base case is when current reaches N, so perhaps the initial setup needs to be adjusted).\n\nWait, the base case is when current == N, the count is 1. So for current = N, all possible last3 codes contribute 1? No, only when the current reaches N, the count is 1. So the base case is dp[N][*] = 1? Or perhaps the base case is when current reaches N, so the function returns 1, so the DP is built from N down.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the DP as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[N][*] = 1 for all possible last3 codes? No, because when current is N, the string is already of length N, so the count is 1 for each possible last3 (but only those that are valid up to that point). Hmm, perhaps the DP is built bottom-up.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the transitions:\n\nFor each current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n   for each possible last3 code:\n\n      for each possible next character (A, C, G, T):\n\n          new_char = c (0-3)\n\n          new_last3 = (last3_code % 16) *4 + new_char; // because the last three are the last two of the previous last3 plus the new_char.\n\n          // Wait, the previous last3 is three characters. Adding a new character, the new last3 is the last two characters of the previous last3 plus the new character.\n\n          Wait, the previous last3 is the last three characters. When adding a new character, the new last three are the previous last two plus the new character.\n\n          So, for example, if previous last3 is \"XYZ\", adding 'A' gives new last3 \"YZA\".\n\n          To compute the new_last3 code:\n\n          The previous last3 code is (X)*16 + Y*4 + Z.\n\n          The last two characters are Y and Z. So the new last3 is Y Z new_char.\n\n          So the new code is (Y)*4 + Z*1 + new_char * 1? Wait, no:\n\n          The new last3 is Y Z new_char \u2192 the first character is Y (position 0), second Z (position1), third new_char (position2).\n\n          So the code is (Y)*16 + Z*4 + new_char.\n\n          To get Y and Z from the previous last3 code:\n\n          The previous last3 code is (X)*16 + Y*4 + Z \u2192 the last two characters are Y and Z. So Y is (code /4) /4 \u2192 code divided by 4 gives (X*4 + Y), then divided by 4 again gives X? Wait, perhaps better to compute:\n\n          The previous last3 code is stored as an integer. To get the last two characters:\n\n          The previous last3 is three characters: c0, c1, c2. The code is c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n\n          The last two characters are c1 and c2. So the new last3 after adding new_char is c1, c2, new_char \u2192 code is c1*16 + c2*4 + new_char.\n\n          So to compute the new code from the previous code:\n\n          The previous code is prev_code = c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n\n          The new code is (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + new_char.\n\n          To get c1 and c2 from prev_code:\n\n          c1 = (prev_code /4) %4 \u2192 because (prev_code /4) is c0*4 + c1 \u2192 mod4 gives c1.\n\n          c2 = prev_code %4.\n\n          So:\n\n          c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n          c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n          new_code = c1 *16 + c2 *4 + new_char;\n\n          So that's how to compute the new code.\n\n          Now, for each possible previous state (current, prev_code), and for each possible new_char (0-3), we can compute the new_code and check if adding the new_char is allowed.\n\n          The isOK function needs to be implemented in C. Let's see:\n\n          The function isOK checks two things:\n\n          1. The last4 (previous last3 + new_char) does not contain \"AGC\".\n\n          2. For each i from 0 to 2 in the last4 string, swapping i and i+1 and checking if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\n          To compute this, we can construct the last4 string as the previous last3 (three characters) plus the new_char (fourth character). Then check the conditions.\n\n          Alternatively, since the previous last3 is three characters, adding the new_char gives a four-character string. Let's call this s = s0 s1 s2 s3 (where s0 is the first of the previous last3, s1 next, s2 next, and s3 is new_char).\n\n          Wait, the previous last3 is the last three characters of the current string. Adding a new character makes the new last three the last two of previous plus new_char. The four-character string is the previous last3 (three chars) plus the new_char \u2192 total four characters. So s is the four-character string.\n\n          So first, check if \"AGC\" is a substring of s. If yes, then invalid.\n\n          Then, for each i from 0 to 2 (since the four characters are 0-based up to 3):\n\n              create a new string by swapping s[i] and s[i+1].\n\n              check if \"AGC\" is a substring of this new string.\n\n              if any of these swaps result in \"AGC\", then invalid.\n\n          So the function isOK returns true only if none of these conditions are met.\n\n          To implement this in C, given the previous last3 code and the new_char, we can:\n\n          1. Reconstruct the four-character string s.\n\n          2. Check for \"AGC\" in s.\n\n          3. For each i in 0-2, swap s[i] and s[i+1], check for \"AGC\".\n\n          To reconstruct s:\n\n          The previous last3 code is prev_code \u2192 which is c0 (first char of last3), c1, c2.\n\n          So s0 = c0, s1 = c1, s2 = c2, s3 = new_char.\n\n          So the four characters are s0, s1, s2, s3.\n\n          So to check for \"AGC\" in s:\n\n          Check if any of the three consecutive triplets (positions 0-2, 1-3) form \"AGC\".\n\n          Wait, the four characters can have \"AGC\" starting at position 0, 1, or 2.\n\n          So check if s0 s1 s2 is \"AGC\", or s1 s2 s3 is \"AGC\".\n\n          Wait, the four characters are s0 s1 s2 s3. The possible substrings of length 3 are:\n\n          s0-s1-s2,\n\n          s1-s2-s3.\n\n          So if either of those is \"AGC\", then it's invalid.\n\n          Then, for the swapped checks:\n\n          For each i from 0 to 2:\n\n              create a new string where s[i] and s[i+1] are swapped.\n\n              check if any of the three-character substrings in this new string contain \"AGC\".\n\n          For example, when i=0:\n\n              swap s[0] and s[1], resulting in s1, s0, s2, s3.\n\n              check the first three (s1, s0, s2) and the next three (s0, s2, s3).\n\n          Similarly for i=1 and i=2.\n\n          This is a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\n          Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the four characters as an array and perform the checks.\n\n          Let me think of the steps in code:\n\n          To implement isOK:\n\n          Given prev_code (the previous last3's code) and new_char (0-3):\n\n              // get the four characters:\n\n              c0 = (prev_code / 16) %4; // first character of previous last3\n\n              c1 = (prev_code /4) %4; // second character\n\n              c2 = prev_code %4; // third character\n\n              c3 = new_char;\n\n              // create the four characters as an array:\n\n              char s[4] = {c0, c1, c2, c3};\n\n              // check if any of the three-character substrings in s contain \"AGC\".\n\n              // \"AGC\" is represented as 0,2,1 (since A=0, G=2, C=1)\n\n              // check first triplet (indices 0-2):\n\n              if ( (s[0]==0 && s[1]==2 && s[2]==1) || (s[1]==0 && s[2]==2 && s[3]==1) ) \u2192 then invalid.\n\n              Wait, the first triplet is s[0], s[1], s[2], the second is s[1], s[2], s[3].\n\n              So check if either of those is exactly \"AGC\" (0,2,1).\n\n              So:\n\n              if ( (s[0]==0 && s[1]==2 && s[2]==1) || (s[1]==0 && s[2]==2 && s[3]==1) ) \u2192 return false.\n\n              Then, for each i from 0 to 2:\n\n                  create a copy of s, swap s[i] and s[i+1].\n\n                  check the first three and the next three in the swapped array.\n\n              For example, for i=0:\n\n                  swapped_s[0] = s[1], swapped_s[1] = s[0], swapped_s[2] = s[2], swapped_s[3] = s[3].\n\n                  check if any of the first three (swapped_s[0],1,2) or next three (swapped_s[1],2,3) is \"AGC\".\n\n              Similarly for i=1 and i=2.\n\n              If any of these checks find \"AGC\", then return false.\n\n              Else, return true.\n\n          This is a bit involved, but manageable in code.\n\n          Now, the DP approach in C would be:\n\n          Initialize a 2D array dp[N+1][64], with all elements 0.\n\n          The base case is when current == N, so dp[N][*] = 1 for all possible last3 codes? No, because when current reaches N, the function returns 1, so for current = N, the value is 1 regardless of the last3 (since the string is already of length N, so the count is 1 for each valid path that reaches that state). Wait, no. The base case is when current == N, the count is 1. So for current = N, the dp[N][last3] = 1 for all last3 codes (since the function returns 1 when current reaches N). But actually, the function returns 1 only if the path is valid up to that point. Wait, no, the function dfs is called only when the path is valid. Because in the recursive step, only valid transitions are considered. So the base case is that when current reaches N, the count is 1, regardless of the last3 (since the path was valid up to that point). So the base case is dp[N][last3] = 1 for all last3 codes.\n\n          Wait, but in the code's dfs function, when current == N, it returns 1, so the base case is that for any last3, when current is N, the count is 1. So the DP array's base case is dp[N][last3] = 1 for all last3.\n\n          Then, for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n              for each possible last3 code (0-63):\n\n                  dp[current][last3] = 0;\n\n                  for each possible new_char (0-3):\n\n                      if isOK(last3, new_char):\n\n                          new_code = compute_new_code(last3, new_char);\n\n                          dp[current][last3] += dp[current+1][new_code];\n\n                          dp[current][last3] %= MOD;\n\n          Wait, but the transitions are from current to current+1. So the DP is built from N down to 0.\n\n          Wait, the current starts at 0 and goes up to N. So the DP should be filled in reverse order.\n\n          So the steps are:\n\n          Initialize dp[N][*] = 1.\n\n          Then for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n              for each last3 in 0..63:\n\n                  total = 0;\n\n                  for each new_char in 0..3:\n\n                      if isOK(last3, new_char):\n\n                          new_code = compute_new_code(last3, new_char);\n\n                          total += dp[current+1][new_code];\n\n                          total %= MOD;\n\n                  dp[current][last3] = total;\n\n          The final result is dp[0][63], since the initial call is with last3 = \"TTT\" (code 63) and current 0.\n\n          So in C, we can implement this with a 2D array. The size would be (N+1) x 64. Since N can be up to 1e5, this would require 1e5 * 64 = 6.4e6 elements. Each element is a long (64-bit), but in C, using unsigned long long (since mod is 1e9+7 which is less than 2^30, so even a 32-bit integer would suffice, but to be safe, use 64-bit).\n\n          So the code for the second part would involve:\n\n          - Read N (the first number from the first program's output, which is X).\n\n          - Compute the DP array as described.\n\n          - The result is dp[0][63].\n\n          Now, the third program's code is straightforward: given an integer n (the result from the second program), compute (n /3)*2 + (n%3 !=0 ? 1 :0).\n\n          So putting it all together:\n\n          The C program will:\n\n          1. Read the first three lines as per the first Java program.\n\n          2. Process to get X (the first number of the first program's output).\n\n          3. Compute the second program's result (Z) using the DP approach.\n\n          4. Compute the third program's result based on Z.\n\n          5. Output the final result.\n\n          Now, let's think about the steps in code.\n\n          First, handling the first part:\n\n          Read first line: split into tokens, get the first token (str0).\n\n          Read second line: two integers a and b.\n\n          Read third line: string u.\n\n          Compare u to str0. If equal, X = a-1, else X = a.\n\n          Wait, no: the first program's output is either (a-1) and b, or a and (b-1). So the first number is a-1 if u equals str[0], else a. So X is a-1 or a.\n\n          So code steps:\n\n          Read first line into a buffer, split into tokens (using strtok), first token is str0.\n\n          Read second line: read two integers a and b.\n\n          Read third line: read into u.\n\n          Compare u to str0. If equal, X = a-1, else X = a.\n\n          Wait, no: the first program's output is (a-1) and b if u equals str0, else a and (b-1). So the first number is a-1 or a, depending on the condition. So X is a-1 or a.\n\n          So after processing the first part, X is the first number, and Y is the second (but Y is not used).\n\n          Now, the second part's N is X.\n\n          So the second part's code will take N = X, compute Z.\n\n          Now, the DP implementation in C:\n\n          We need to implement the DP array. Let's see:\n\n          The maximum N can be up to 1e5, but let's see what the problem constraints are. Looking up ABC122_D's problem statement (since I can't actually do that right now, but assuming it's a programming contest problem, N is likely up to 1e5 or similar).\n\n          So for N up to 1e5, the DP array would be 1e5+1 rows and 64 columns. Each element is a 64-bit integer. The total memory is (1e5+1)*64 * 8 bytes \u2248 5MB, which is manageable.\n\n          So in C, we can declare a 2D array as:\n\n          #define MOD 1000000007ULL\n\n          unsigned long long dp[100001][64]; // assuming N up to 1e5.\n\n          But in practice, the maximum N might be up to 1e5, so this is okay.\n\n          The code steps for the DP:\n\n          Initialize all dp[N][*] to 1.\n\n          Then for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n              for each last3 in 0..63:\n\n                  dp[current][last3] = 0;\n\n                  for each new_char in 0..3:\n\n                      if isOK(last3, new_char):\n\n                          compute new_code.\n\n                          add dp[current+1][new_code] to dp[current][last3].\n\n                  mod by MOD.\n\n          The function isOK needs to be implemented as a helper function.\n\n          Now, implementing the isOK function:\n\n          Let's write a helper function:\n\n          int is_ok(int prev_code, int new_char) {\n\n              // compute the four characters.\n\n              int c0 = (prev_code / 16) %4;\n\n              int c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n              int c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n              int c3 = new_char;\n\n              // check the original four characters for \"AGC\".\n\n              if ( (c0 ==0 && c1 ==2 && c2 ==1) || (c1 ==0 && c2 ==2 && c3 ==1) ) {\n\n                  return 0; // contains AGC.\n\n              }\n\n              // Now check the swapped cases.\n\n              // create the four characters array.\n\n              int s[4] = {c0, c1, c2, c3};\n\n              // check for each i from 0 to 2:\n\n              for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n                  // swap s[i] and s[i+1]\n\n                  int temp = s[i];\n\n                  s[i] = s[i+1];\n\n                  s[i+1] = temp;\n\n                  // check the first three and next three.\n\n                  if ( (s[0]==0 && s[1]==2 && s[2]==1) || (s[1]==0 && s[2]==2 && s[3]==1) ) {\n\n                      // revert the swap and return 0.\n\n                      s[i+1] = s[i];\n\n                      s[i] = temp;\n\n                      return 0;\n\n                  }\n\n                  // revert the swap for next iteration.\n\n                  s[i+1] = s[i];\n\n                  s[i] = temp;\n\n              }\n\n              return 1;\n\n          }\n\n          Wait, but in the code above, after swapping, we need to check all possible triplets in the swapped string. The swapped string is s after swapping i and i+1. The triplets are the first three and the next three (positions 0-2 and 1-3).\n\n          So in the code above, after swapping, we check if either of those triplets is \"AGC\".\n\n          If any of them is, then return 0 (invalid).\n\n          Also, after checking, we need to revert the swap to check the next i.\n\n          This should work.\n\n          Now, the new_code computation:\n\n          Given prev_code and new_char, compute new_code as:\n\n          int c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n          int c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n          new_code = c1 *16 + c2 *4 + new_char;\n\n          So:\n\n          int compute_new_code(int prev_code, int new_char) {\n\n              int c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n              int c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n              return c1 *16 + c2 *4 + new_char;\n\n          }\n\n          Now, putting it all together.\n\n          The main steps in C:\n\n          Read the first three lines:\n\n          First line: read into a buffer, split into tokens to get the first token (str0).\n\n          Second line: read two integers a and b.\n\n          Third line: read into u.\n\n          Compare u to str0. If equal, X = a-1, else X = a.\n\n          Then, compute N = X.\n\n          Then compute Z via the DP.\n\n          Then compute the third part's result: (Z /3)*2 + (Z%3 !=0 ? 1 :0).\n\n          Now, handling the first part's input in C:\n\n          For reading the first line, which is split into tokens, we can use strtok.\n\n          For example:\n\n          char first_line[100]; // assuming the line is not too long.\n\n          fgets(first_line, 100, stdin);\n\n          char *token = strtok(first_line, \" \");\n\n          char str0[100]; // store the first token.\n\n          strcpy(str0, token);\n\n          Then, read the second line:\n\n          int a, b;\n\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n          Then read the third line:\n\n          char u[100];\n\n          fgets(u, 100, stdin);\n\n          But need to be careful with possible newlines in the input. For example, fgets includes the newline, so maybe using scanf for the third line?\n\n          Alternatively, after reading the first two lines with fgets, the third line can be read with fgets as well.\n\n          Also, when comparing strings, need to ensure that the newline is stripped.\n\n          For example, after reading u with fgets, the trailing newline may be present. So:\n\n          u[strcspn(u, \"\\n\")] = 0; // remove trailing newline.\n\n          Similarly for str0.\n\n          So code steps:\n\n          // Read first line:\n\n          char first_line[100];\n\n          fgets(first_line, 100, stdin);\n\n          first_line[strcspn(first_line, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n          char *token = strtok(first_line, \" \");\n\n          char str0[100];\n\n          strcpy(str0, token);\n\n          // Read second line:\n\n          int a, b;\n\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n          // Read third line:\n\n          char u[100];\n\n          fgets(u, 100, stdin);\n\n          u[strcspn(u, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n          // Compare u and str0:\n\n          int X;\n\n          if (strcmp(u, str0) == 0) {\n\n              X = a-1;\n\n          } else {\n\n              X = a;\n\n          }\n\n          Now, proceed to compute Z using the DP for N = X.\n\n          Now, the DP code:\n\n          We need to initialize the DP array.\n\n          Let's assume N can be up to 1e5. So we can have a maximum N of 1e5.\n\n          So first, check if X is within the allowed range (but the problem likely allows it).\n\n          Then:\n\n          int N = X;\n\n          // Initialize DP array.\n\n          // Since the array is big, we need to dynamically allocate it?\n\n          Wait, in C, declaring a 2D array of size [1e5+1][64] may be possible on the stack, but it's better to use dynamic allocation.\n\n          Alternatively, since the maximum N is 1e5, we can pre-allocate a 2D array with a static size.\n\n          Let's define:\n\n          #define MAX_N 100000\n\n          #define MOD 1000000007ULL\n\n          unsigned long long dp[MAX_N+1][64];\n\n          Then, in the code:\n\n          int N = X;\n\n          // Initialize dp[N][*] to 1.\n\n          for (int i=0; i<64; i++) {\n\n              dp[N][i] = 1;\n\n          }\n\n          // Now fill the DP from N-1 down to 0.\n\n          for (int current = N-1; current >=0; current--) {\n\n              for (int last3 =0; last3 <64; last3++) {\n\n                  dp[current][last3] =0;\n\n                  for (int new_char=0; new_char <4; new_char++) {\n\n                      if (is_ok(last3, new_char)) {\n\n                          int new_code = compute_new_code(last3, new_char);\n\n                          dp[current][last3] += dp[current+1][new_code];\n\n                          if (dp[current][last3] >= MOD) {\n\n                              dp[current][last3] -= MOD;\n\n                          }\n\n                      }\n\n                  }\n\n                  // mod after adding all?\n\n                  dp[current][last3] %= MOD;\n\n              }\n\n          }\n\n          The result is dp[0][63].\n\n          Wait, but in the code above, the inner loop for new_char adds to dp[current][last3], and after each addition, we mod? Or mod at the end?\n\n          To prevent overflow, it's better to mod after each addition, but since MOD is 1e9+7, adding up to 4 terms (each up to MOD-1) would not exceed 4*(1e9+7) which is manageable in 64-bit.\n\n          Alternatively, after the loop over new_char, mod once.\n\n          So the code can be:\n\n          dp[current][last3] %= MOD;\n\n          at the end of the loop over new_char.\n\n          Now, the final result is dp[0][63].\n\n          Then, compute the third part's result:\n\n          int Z = dp[0][63]; // but wait, it's an unsigned long long, but since MOD is 1e9+7, it's within 32 bits.\n\n          int result = (Z /3)*2 + (Z%3 !=0 ? 1 :0);\n\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n          Putting all together.\n\n          Now, the code structure:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          #define MAX_N 100000\n\n          #define MOD 1000000007ULL\n\n          unsigned long long dp[MAX_N+1][64];\n\n          int compute_new_code(int prev_code, int new_char) {\n\n              int c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n              int c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n              return c1 *16 + c2 *4 + new_char;\n\n          }\n\n          int is_ok(int prev_code, int new_char) {\n\n              int c0 = (prev_code /16) %4;\n\n              int c1 = (prev_code /4) %4;\n\n              int c2 = prev_code %4;\n\n              int c3 = new_char;\n\n              // Check original four characters for \"AGC\"\n\n              if ( (c0 ==0 && c1 ==2 && c2 ==1) || (c1 ==0 && c2 ==2 && c3 ==1) ) {\n\n                  return 0;\n\n              }\n\n              // Check swapped cases.\n\n              int s[4] = {c0, c1, c2, c3};\n\n              for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n                  // swap s[i] and s[i+1]\n\n                  int temp = s[i];\n\n                  s[i] = s[i+1];\n\n                  s[i+1] = temp;\n\n                  // check first three and next three.\n\n                  if ( (s[0]==0 && s[1]==2 && s[2]==1) || (s[1]==0 && s[2]==2 && s[3]==1) ) {\n\n                      // revert the swap and return 0.\n\n                      s[i+1] = s[i];\n\n                      s[i] = temp;\n\n                      return 0;\n\n                  }\n\n                  // revert the swap for next iteration.\n\n                  s[i+1] = s[i];\n\n                  s[i] = temp;\n\n              }\n\n              return 1;\n\n          }\n\n          int main() {\n\n              // Read first part's input.\n\n              char first_line[100];\n\n              fgets(first_line, 100, stdin);\n\n              first_line[strcspn(first_line, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n              char *token = strtok(first_line, \" \");\n\n              char str0[100];\n\n              strcpy(str0, token);\n\n              int a, b;\n\n              scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n              char u[100];\n\n              fgets(u, 100, stdin);\n\n              u[strcspn(u, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n              int X;\n\n              if (strcmp(u, str0) == 0) {\n\n                  X = a-1;\n\n              } else {\n\n                  X = a;\n\n              }\n\n              // Now compute the second part's result.\n\n              int N = X;\n\n              // Initialize DP.\n\n              for (int i=0; i<64; i++) {\n\n                  dp[N][i] = 1;\n\n              }\n\n              for (int current = N-1; current >=0; current--) {\n\n                  for (int last3 =0; last3 <64; last3++) {\n\n                      dp[current][last3] =0;\n\n                      for (int new_char=0; new_char <4; new_char++) {\n\n                          if (is_ok(last3, new_char)) {\n\n                              int new_code = compute_new_code(last3, new_char);\n\n                              dp[current][last3] += dp[current+1][new_code];\n\n                          }\n\n                      }\n\n                      dp[current][last3] %= MOD;\n\n                  }\n\n              }\n\n              unsigned long long Z = dp[0][63];\n\n              // Compute third part's result.\n\n              int result = (Z /3)*2 + (Z%3 !=0 ? 1 :0);\n\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n              return 0;\n\n          }\n\n          Wait, but there's a problem here: the DP array is declared as a static array of size MAX_N+1 (1e5+1) by 64. If the input N is larger than MAX_N, this will overflow. But according to the problem's constraints for ABC122_D, the N is likely up to 1e5, so this should be okay. But in the code, if the user inputs a larger N, it will cause an out-of-bounds error. However, since the problem is a programming contest problem, the constraints are known, so this should be acceptable.\n\n          Also, in the code above, the DP is initialized for N, but if N is 0, then the loop for current starts at -1, which is a problem. So need to handle N=0 case.\n\n          Wait, in the problem's context, N is the input to the second program, which comes from the first program's output. The first program's output's first number is either a-1 or a. The original second Java program expects N to be a positive integer (since it's a problem about strings of length N). So perhaps the code can assume N is within the valid range.\n\n          Also, in the code, when N is 0, the loop for current would start at -1, which is invalid. So need to add a check for N=0.\n\n          Let me think: if N is 0, then the result is dp[0][63]. But according to the DP initialization, when N=0, the base case is when current reaches 0 (since N=0, the base case is when current ==0, so the initial setup would be different.\n\n          Hmm, perhaps the code should handle N=0 as a special case.\n\n          Alternatively, in the code, when N is 0, the loop for current starts at N-1 = -1, which is skipped, so the DP for current=0 is not computed. So the code would have an error.\n\n          To fix this, the loop should be:\n\n          if (N ==0) {\n\n              // then current starts at 0?\n\n              // but the base case is when current ==0, so the initial setup is dp[0][*] =1?\n\n              // Wait, the base case is when current == N (which is 0), so dp[0][last3] =1 for all last3.\n\n              // So the result is dp[0][63], which is 1.\n\n              // So the code would work.\n\n          }\n\n          But in the code above, when N=0, the loop for current runs from -1 down to 0, which is not entered. So the DP for current=0 is initialized as dp[0][last3] =0, but the initial setup is for dp[N][last3] =1 (which is dp[0][last3] =1). So the code is okay.\n\n          Wait, let's see:\n\n          When N=0:\n\n          The initialization sets dp[0][i] =1 for all i.\n\n          Then, the loop for current runs from N-1 = -1 down to 0 \u2192 the loop doesn't execute.\n\n          So the result is dp[0][63] =1, which is correct.\n\n          So the code is okay.\n\n          Now, testing the code for possible edge cases.\n\n          For example, if the first program's output is N=0, then the second program's result is 1, and the third program's result is (1/3)*2 +1 (since 1%3 !=0 \u2192 0.333 \u2192 floor division gives 0, so 0*2 +1 =1.\n\n          So the final output is 1.\n\n          Another test case: if the second program's N is 3, then the result is the number of valid strings of length 3, which should be 64 - invalid ones. But I'm not sure, but the code should handle it.\n\n          Now, the code should be correct.\n\n          So the final C program is as above."
