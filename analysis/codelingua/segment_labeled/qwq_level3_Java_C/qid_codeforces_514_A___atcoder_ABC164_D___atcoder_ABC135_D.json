Then, for each digit (from the end of x):\n\nr = temp %10;\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (temp /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) {\n\n        // add r to the list\n\n        digits[count] = r;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[count] = 9 - r;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    digits[count] = r;\n\n}\n\ntemp = temp /10;\n\ncount++;\n\n} Wait, but the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n        add r;\n\n    } else {\n\n        add 9 - r;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    add r;\n\n}\n\nSo in code, for each digit r:\n\nif ( (9 - r) < r ) {\n\n    if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n        // add r\n\n    } else {\n\n        // add 9 - r\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    // add r\n\n} Wait, but temp is the current value before division. So after taking r = temp%10, temp is divided by 10. So the check for (temp /10 ==0) is equivalent to checking whether this is the last digit (since after division, it will become 0). Wait, in the first iteration, temp is x. After taking r = temp%10, then temp becomes temp/10. So the check (temp /10 ==0) is before division? Wait, no. Let me see: Wait, in the code:\n\ntemp is the current value. r = temp %10;\n\nthen, check if (9 - r < r):\n\nthen, check if (temp /10 ==0) (i.e., after division, it would be zero?), but before division. Wait, the code in Java is:\n\nx = sc.nextLong();\n\nthen in the loop:\n\nr = x%10;\n\nthen check if (x/10 ==0 ... )\n\nthen x = x/10. So in the code, the check is done on the current x (before division). So in C, the same logic applies. So in C code:\n\nlong temp = x;\n\nint count =0;\n\nint digits[20]; // assuming max 19 digits. while (temp >0) {\n\n    int r = temp %10;\n\n    int new_digit;\n\n    if ( (9 - r) < r ) {\n\n        if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n            new_digit = r;\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_digit = 9 - r;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        new_digit = r;\n\n    }\n\n    digits[count] = new_digit;\n\n    count++;\n\n    temp = temp /10;\n\n}\n\nSo after this loop, the digits array has the processed digits in the order of least significant to most (since we process from the end). Then, to form the new number, we need to reverse the digits and combine them.",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_514_A) reads a long integer from input. It processes each digit by checking if replacing it with 9 - digit gives a smaller value. Then it constructs a new number from these digits. The output of this is the newNumber, which should be the input for the next program.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, calculates some modulo counts, and outputs the number of pairs with the same mod 2019 value. Its input is the output of the first program, which is a number. Wait, but the second program expects a string input. Wait, the first program outputs a number, so the second program would read that as a string? Because in Java, Scanner's next() would read the entire line as a string. Wait, the first program's output is a number, so when the second program runs, it would read that as a string S. So the first program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string (the output of the second program, which is a number) and processes it as a string, probably with some DP approach. The output of the third program is the final result.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input, process it through all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into C:\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nThe first program takes a long x, processes each digit, and constructs a new number. Let's see:\n\nThe loop processes x digit by digit from the end. For each digit r (x mod 10), if 9 - r is less than r, then it uses 9 - r, except when it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero (then just r). Then the digits are collected in a list, reversed (since we process from the end), and then combined into newNumber.\n\nWait, the list is built by adding each digit from the least significant digit first. Then when building newNumber, it starts from the first element (the original least significant digit) and builds the number as the first digit becomes the most significant in newNumber. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nThe list is built in the order of the digits as they are extracted from x. For example, if x is 123, then first r is 3, then 2, then 1. The list would be [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, starting with pow=0, adding 3*10^0, then 2*10^1, then 1*10^2. So the newNumber is 321. Wait, but that's just reversing the digits. Wait, but the processing of each digit may change the digit. So the list is the digits in reverse order (since we process from the end), and then when building newNumber, they are added in the order of the list, which is the original reversed digits, so the newNumber is the digits in the original order but each digit possibly modified. Wait, no, the list is built in the order of the digits as they are extracted (from the end), so the first element is the last digit of x, then the second is the second last, etc. Then when building newNumber, the first element is multiplied by 10^0, so the first element becomes the least significant digit again. So the newNumber is the same as the original number's digits, but each digit is possibly replaced, and the order is preserved. Wait, no, the list is built in the order of the digits from the end, so when building newNumber, the first element is the first digit of the new number's least significant digit. So the newNumber is the digits in the same order as the original number, but each digit is possibly modified. Wait, let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose x is 123. The first step: x mod 10 is 3, so list.add(3). Then x becomes 12. Next, mod 10 is 2, add to list. Then x becomes 1, mod 10 is 1, add to list. So list is [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, the first iteration adds 3*10^0, then 2*10^1, then 1*10^2. So newNumber is 321. Wait, that's reversing the digits. But that's only if the processing didn't change the digits. Wait, but the processing may change each digit. For example, if the original digit is 5, then 9-5=4, which is less than 5, so it would be replaced by 4. So the new digit is 4. So the list would have the modified digits in the order of the original digits' reverse. Then when building newNumber, the digits are arranged in the same order as the original digits, but each digit is modified. Wait, no, the newNumber is constructed by taking the list elements in order, so the first element (the original last digit) becomes the first digit of the new number. So the new number is the reverse of the original digits, but each digit is possibly modified. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the original number is 123, so the digits are 1,2,3. The list is [3,2,1], so the new number is 321. So the first program is reversing the digits? That can't be the intended behavior. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program:\n\nThe loop is while x>0:\n\nr = x%10 (so the last digit)\n\nthen decide whether to add r or 9-r.\n\nThen x = x/10 (so moving to the next digit to the left).\n\nThe list is built in the order of the digits from the end. So the list contains the digits in reverse order of the original number. Then when building newNumber, the list is processed from first to last, which is the same as the original digits' order, but each digit is possibly modified. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 123. The list is [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (3) is multiplied by 10^0, then 2 by 10^1, then 1 by 10^2. So the new number is 3*1 + 2*10 + 1*100 = 123? Wait no, 3 + 20 + 100 = 123. Wait, that's the same as the original number. But that's only if the digits weren't modified. Wait, but in the code, the digits are modified. Let me see an example where a digit is changed.\n\nSuppose the original number is 5. Then x is 5. The loop runs once:\n\nr =5 mod10 is 5. 9-5 is 4, which is less than 5. So since x/10 is 0, and 9-r is 4 (not zero?), wait the condition says if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) then add r. Wait, in this case, 9 -5 is 4, so the condition is not met. So it adds 9 - r (4). So the list is [4]. Then newNumber is 4. So the output is 4. So the first program's output is 4 for input 5.\n\nWait, so the first program's processing is for each digit, replacing it with 9 - digit if that gives a smaller value, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero (then leave it as digit). Wait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 (meaning it's the last digit) and 9 - r ==0) then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\nWait, the condition for adding 9 - r is when 9 - r is less than r, except when it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n   else list.add(9 - r);\n\n} else list.add(r);\n\nSo for the last digit (x/10 ==0), if 9 - r is less than r, but 9 - r is zero, then we add r instead of 9 - r. Wait, 9 - r ==0 implies r is 9. So in that case, 9 - r is 0, which is less than r (9). So the first condition is true, but since it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero, we add r (9) instead of 0. So for example, if the digit is 9, then it stays as 9. Because 9-9=0 <9, but since it's the last digit and 9-r is zero, we add r (9). So the digit remains 9.\n\nAnother example: digit is 5. Not last digit: then 9-5=4 <5, so add 4. If it's the last digit and 9 - r is not zero, like digit 8 (9-8=1 <8, and it's last digit, but 9-8 is 1 !=0, so add 1. So the digit becomes 1.\n\nWait, so the first program's processing is to replace each digit with the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero (i.e., digit is 9), in which case it stays as 9.\n\nSo the first program's output is the number formed by replacing each digit with the minimal between digit and 9-digit, except for the last digit when it's 9 (then stays 9).\n\nSo the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second program.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, which is the output of the first program. It calculates the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the substring from i to j-1 (or something like that) mod 2019 is the same. The code uses a clever approach with prefix mods and counts.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string (the output of the second program, which is a number, so the string is the number's digits) and computes the number of ways to replace '?' with digits so that the number mod 13 is 5. The DP approach is used here.\n\nNow, to translate all this into a single C program.\n\nFirst, the C program must read the initial input (the first program's input), process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Process the input number through the first Java program's logic to get the first output (a number).\n\n2. Convert that number to a string (since the second program expects a string input).\n\n3. Process that string through the second program's logic to get the second output (a number).\n\n4. Convert that number to a string (since the third program expects a string input).\n\n5. Process that string through the third program's logic to get the final output.\n\nWait, but in the original Java setup, each program's output is the input to the next. So the first program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the second program. The second program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the third program. The third program's output is the final result.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\n- Read the initial input (the first program's input) as a long (or as a string, but probably as a number).\n\nWait, but in Java, the first program reads a long. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then parse it to a long (or handle it as a string, but perhaps easier to process as a number first).\n\nWait, but the first program's input is a long. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then parse it to a long (or handle it as a number). Let's see.\n\nFirst step: first program's processing.\n\nLet me think of the first program's logic in C.\n\nFirst, the first program's input is a long x. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then parse it to a long. But perhaps it's easier to read as a string, process each digit, but maybe not. Alternatively, read as a long, then process.\n\nWait, but in C, the input can be read as a string, then parsed to a long. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the first program's processing:\n\nWe need to take the input number, process each digit, and create the new number.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code.\n\nIn C, to process the first step:\n\nRead the input as a string (since it could be very large, but in Java it's a long, so up to 19 digits). Wait, but in Java, a long can be up to 19 digits. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then process each digit.\n\nWait, but the first program's code is processing the number digit by digit, so perhaps it's easier to process the input as a string directly, instead of converting to a number (since for very large numbers, converting to a long might overflow, but in the original Java code, it's a long, so the input must be within the long's range).\n\nWait, the first Java program uses a long, so the input must be a number that fits in a long. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then parse it to a long (since it's within the range). Then process each digit as per the first program's logic.\n\nWait, but when processing the digits, the first program processes the number digit by digit from the end (since it does x mod 10, then x = x/10). So in C, we can take the input as a long, then process it similarly.\n\nAlternatively, process the digits as a string. Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Read the input as a string, then process each character (digit) from the end to the beginning, applying the first program's logic, then build the new number as a string, then convert to a long for the next step.\n\nOption 2: Read the input as a long, then process each digit as in the first Java code.\n\nBut in C, if the input is a very large number (like 19 digits), then converting to a long (which is 64-bit) would be okay, but in practice, the input is given as a string, so perhaps better to process as a string.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's code uses a long, so the input must be a valid long. So in C, we can read the input as a string, then parse it to a long (using strtol or similar), then process each digit as per the first program's code.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst step in C:\n\nRead the input as a string, parse to a long x.\n\nThen process x as per first program's code.\n\nWait, but the first program's code processes x digit by digit, so in C, we can do the same.\n\nSo code for first step:\n\nlong x = parsed input.\n\nThen:\n\nList<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();\n\nIn C, we can use an array to store the digits.\n\nInitialize an array of digits, say, an array of integers (since each digit is 0-9).\n\nWe can compute the digits by repeatedly taking mod 10 and dividing by 10, but since we need to process from the end, we can collect the digits in reverse order (like the list in Java).\n\nWait, in the first program's code, the list is built by taking the digits from the end (mod 10, then divide by 10). So the digits are stored in the list in the order of the least significant digit first. So in C, we can collect the digits in an array, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nSo:\n\nInitialize an array (or a dynamic array) to hold the digits.\n\nThen:\n\nlong temp = x;\n\nint digits[20]; // assuming max 19 digits plus sign?\n\nint count =0;\n\nwhile (temp >0) {\n\n    int r = temp %10;\n\n    // process r as per first program's logic.\n\n    // but wait, the processing is part of the first step.\n\nWait, actually, the processing of each digit (whether to replace with 9 - r or not) is part of the first step. So the code for the first step is:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the processed digits.\n\nThen, for each digit (from the end of x):\n\nr = temp %10;\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (temp /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) {\n\n        // add r to the list\n\n        digits[count] = r;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[count] = 9 - r;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    digits[count] = r;\n\n}\n\ntemp = temp /10;\n\ncount++;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n        add r;\n\n    } else {\n\n        add 9 - r;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    add r;\n\n}\n\nSo in code, for each digit r:\n\nif ( (9 - r) < r ) {\n\n    if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n        // add r\n\n    } else {\n\n        // add 9 - r\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    // add r\n\n}\n\nWait, but temp is the current value before division. So after taking r = temp%10, temp is divided by 10. So the check for (temp /10 ==0) is equivalent to checking whether this is the last digit (since after division, it will become 0).\n\nWait, in the first iteration, temp is x. After taking r = temp%10, then temp becomes temp/10. So the check (temp /10 ==0) is before division? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ntemp is the current value.\n\nr = temp %10;\n\nthen, check if (9 - r < r):\n\nthen, check if (temp /10 ==0) (i.e., after division, it would be zero?), but before division.\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nx = sc.nextLong();\n\nthen in the loop:\n\nr = x%10;\n\nthen check if (x/10 ==0 ... )\n\nthen x = x/10.\n\nSo in the code, the check is done on the current x (before division). So in C, the same logic applies.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nlong temp = x;\n\nint count =0;\n\nint digits[20]; // assuming max 19 digits.\n\nwhile (temp >0) {\n\n    int r = temp %10;\n\n    int new_digit;\n\n    if ( (9 - r) < r ) {\n\n        if ( (temp /10 ==0) && (9 - r ==0) ) {\n\n            new_digit = r;\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_digit = 9 - r;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        new_digit = r;\n\n    }\n\n    digits[count] = new_digit;\n\n    count++;\n\n    temp = temp /10;\n\n}\n\nSo after this loop, the digits array has the processed digits in the order of least significant to most (since we process from the end). Then, to form the new number, we need to reverse the digits and combine them.\n\nWait, the newNumber is built by starting with the first digit (digits[0]) as the least significant digit, then digits[1] as next, etc. So the digits array is in the order of the original digits' reverse, but each digit is processed. So the new number is formed by taking digits[0] * 10^0 + digits[1] *10^1 + ... + digits[count-1] *10^{count-1}.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the newNumber is built as:\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nfor each i from 0 to list.size()-1:\n\nnewNumber += list.get(i) * 10^pow;\n\npow++;\n\nSo the first element (digits[0]) is multiplied by 10^0, the next by 10^1, etc. So the digits are in the same order as stored in the array, so the new number is digits[0] *1 + digits[1] *10 + ... + digits[count-1] *10^{count-1}.\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the digits array's order. So the digits array is the digits of the new number in the correct order (from least to most significant). So the new number is the digits array interpreted as a number.\n\nWait, but in the example where x was 123, the digits array would be [3,2,1], so the new number is 3*1 + 2*10 + 1*100 = 123. But according to the first program's code, the new number would be 321? Wait, no, in the first program's code, the list is [3,2,1], so the newNumber is 3 + 2*10 + 1*100 = 123. Wait, that's the same as the original number. But that's only if the digits weren't modified. Wait, but in the example where x is 5, the digits array would be [4], so newNumber is 4. Which is correct.\n\nWait, so the first program's output is the same as the original number's digits, but each digit is replaced with the minimal between digit and 9-digit, except for the last digit when it's 9 (then stays 9). So the new number is the same as the original number's digits processed in that way, but the digits are in the same order as the original number. Wait, no, because the digits array is built from the end. Wait, the digits array is the digits of the original number in reverse order, but each digit is processed. So the new number is the digits array in the same order, which is the original number's digits reversed, but each digit processed. Wait, no, the digits array is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse. So the new number is the digits array in the same order, which would be the processed digits in the same order as the original digits' reverse. So the new number is the processed digits arranged in the same order as the original digits' reverse. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original number is 123. The digits array is [3,2,1], so the new number is 3*1 + 2*10 + 1*100 = 123. So the new number is the same as the original. But that's only if the digits weren't modified. So the first program's processing doesn't change the number in this case. But if the digits are modified, like in the case of 5, it becomes 4. So the first program's output is the number formed by the processed digits in the same order as the original digits' reverse? No, the digits array is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse. So the new number is the digits array in the same order, which is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse. Wait, but in the example of 123, the new number is 123, which is the same as the original. So the digits array is [3,2,1], which when combined gives 3 + 20 + 100 = 123. So the order is correct. So the new number is the same as the original number's digits processed, but arranged in the same order as the original digits. Because the digits array is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse, but when building the new number, the digits are added in the order of the array, which is the same as the original digits' reverse. Wait, no, the digits array is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse. So the new number is the digits array in the same order, which is the processed digits in the original digits' reverse order. So the new number is the processed digits arranged in the same order as the original digits' reverse. Wait, but in the example of 123, the digits array is [3,2,1], so the new number is 321? No, because 3*10^0 + 2*10^1 + 1*10^2 is 3 + 20 + 100 = 123. Oh right, because the digits are added in the order of the array, which is the original digits' reverse, but when building the number, each digit is multiplied by 10^power, so the first element (3) is the least significant digit. So the new number is the same as the original number's digits processed, but arranged in the same order as the original digits. Because the digits array is the processed digits in the order of the original digits' reverse, but when building the new number, the digits are added in the order of the array, so the first digit is the least significant digit.
