Wait, the code's first condition is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n    digits[i+1]++;\n\n    digits[i] =0;\n\n} So this handles any digit that is 10, which can only happen if a previous step added a carry. Then, after that, the code processes the digit's value. So in C, the code would be similar. The bills variable starts at 0. Then, for each i from 0 to len (inclusive):\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n    digits[i+1]++;\n\n    digits[i] =0;\n\n} Then, check the digit's value. Wait, but after setting digits[i] to 0, the next steps will process the digit's value. Wait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i:\n\n    if digit is 10, handle carry. then, process the digit's value (now 0-9 or 10? No, after handling, it's 0). Wait, after the first condition, the digit is now 0 (if it was 10). Then, the next conditions are:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) add to bills.\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) add 5, and check next digit for carry. else (digits[i] >5) add 10 - digits[i], and carry over.

So the elements from n to maxn-1 remain 0. So in C, we need to first set all elements to 0, then set the first n elements (except dp[0]) to INT_MIN. So:\n\n    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // set all to 0\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        dp[i] = INT_MIN;\n    }\n    dp[0] = 0;\n\n    Then proceed with the loops. Then, for each coin in arr:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        int coin = arr[i];\n        for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n            if (dp[j - coin] ! = INT_MIN && dp[j - coin] + 1 > dp[j]) {\n                dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n            }\n        }\n    } Wait, but in Java, the code uses Math.max, so the condition is whether the new value is better. The original code in Java:\n\n    dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] + 1);\n\n    So in C, the equivalent is:\n\n    if (dp[j - coin] +1 > dp[j]) then set dp[j] to that value. But we have to ensure that dp[j - coin] is not INT_MIN (since if it's -infinity, then adding 1 would be worse). So in the loop over j, for each j starting from coin, we check if dp[j - coin] is not INT_MIN. So the code inside the inner loop would be:\n\n    if (dp[j - coin] != INT_MIN) {\n        if (dp[j] < dp[j - coin] +1) {\n            dp[j] = dp[j - coin] +1;\n        }\n    } So that's important to avoid using invalid values. After processing all coins, the result1 is dp[n]. Now, moving to the second part. Once result1 is computed, we need to process it through the second program's logic. So:\n\n    int result1 = dp[n];\n\n    Now, convert result1 to a string. char str1[20];\n    sprintf(str1, \"%d\", result1);\n\n    Then, process this string as per the second program. Let's code that part.

So:\n\n    int digits[len +2]; \n\n    Then, the loop for filling digits would be:\n\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n        digits[i] = str1[len -1 -i] - '0';\n\n    }\n\n    digits[len] =0; \n\n    digits[len+1] =0; \n\n    Then, the loop runs up to i <= len. So when i is len, digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is within the array. That way, the code can handle the case where i is the last index. So modifying the code:\n\n    int len = strlen(str1);\n    int digits_size = len +2;\n    int digits[digits_size];\n    memset(digits, 0, sizeof(digits));\n\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n        digits[i] = str1[len -1 -i] - '0';\n    }\n\n    Then, the loop:\n\n    for (int i=0; i <= len; i++) { // since digits has len+2 elements, i can go up to len (digits[len] is valid, and i+1 is len+1 which is within digits_size-1 (len+1) ) So this way, the code can handle the case where i is the last index. So this adjustment is necessary to prevent array out of bounds in C. So I'll adjust the code accordingly. Now, proceeding with the code for the second part. After processing, the bills variable holds the result. Then, the third part: \n\n    Convert bills to a string, take the first character, add 1, and print. So:\n\n    char str2[20];\n    sprintf(str2, \"%d\", bills);\n    if (strlen(str2) ==0) { // unlikely, but handle empty string? }\n    char first_char = str2[0];\n    printf(\"%c\", first_char +1);\n\n    So putting it all together. Now, putting all the code into a single C program. Let me outline the steps again:\n\n    1. Read n, a, b, c from input. 2. Compute result1 via DP. 3. Convert result1 to string, process through second program's logic to get bills (result2). 4. Convert result2 to string, take first character, add 1, print. Now, coding this step by step. The full C code would be:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <limits.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        int n, a, b, c; scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &n, &a, &b, &c);\n        int arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n        const int maxn = 4010;\n        int dp[maxn];\n        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize all to 0\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            dp[i] = INT_MIN;\n        }\n        dp[0] = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n            int coin = arr[i];\n            for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n                if (dp[j - coin] ! = INT_MIN && dp[j] < dp[j - coin] + 1) {\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        int result1 = dp[n];\n\n        // Process second part\n        char str1[20];\n        sprintf(str1, \"%d\", result1);\n        int len = strlen(str1);\n        int digits_size = len + 2;\n        int digits[digits_size];\n        memset(digits, 0, sizeof(digits));\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            digits[i] = str1[len - 1 - i] - '0';\n        }\n        int bills = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n            if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                if (digits[i + 1] >= 5) {\n                    digits[i + 1]++;\n                }\n                bills += 5;\n            } else {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                bills += 10 - digits[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Process third part\n        char str2[20];\n        sprintf(str2, \"%d\", bills);\n        if (strlen(str2) > 0) {\n            printf(\"%c\", str2[0] + 1);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"0\"); // handle empty string, but unlikely\n        }\n        return 0;\n    } Wait, but in the second part's loop, after handling the digit[i] ==10, we need to process the digit's value again? Or is the first condition part of the loop's processing? Looking back at the Java code:\n\n    The code in the loop is:\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... } Then, the next conditions are based on the current digits[i], which after the first condition is now 0 (if it was 10). So the code is correct as written.",

      "text": "Also, in the C code, after the first condition, the digit is set to 0, so the next conditions are based on the updated value. So the code is okay. Now, testing edge cases. For example, if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's input is \"0\". The second program's processing:\n\n    digits array for \"0\" is len=1, digits[0] =0, digits[1]=0, digits[2]=0 (since digits_size is 3). The loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (since len is 1). i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills. i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. So bills is 0. Then third program takes \"0\", first character is '0', add 1 \u2192 '1' is printed. So the output is '1'. Which is correct. Another test case: first program's output is 5. Second program's input is \"5\". digits[0] =5, digits[1]=0, digits[2]=0. \n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 5 \u2192 check if digits[1] (0) >=5? No. So add 5 to bills. i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=2 (since len is 1, the loop runs up to i=1? Wait, no. Wait, len is 1, so the loop runs from i=0 to i <= len (1). So i=0 and 1. Wait, len is 1, so the loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). So i=0 and 1. \n\n    i=0: as above. i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. So total bills is 5. Third program takes \"5\", first character '5' \u2192 '6' is printed. So output is '6'. That's correct. Another test case: first program's output is 10. Second program's input is \"10\". digits array for \"10\" is len=2. digits[0] =0 (from '0'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2] =0, digits[3] =0 (since digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, len is 2, so digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, no, digits_size is len+2. Wait, len is 2, so digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, no, digits_size = len +2 \u2192 2+2=4? Wait, len is the length of the string (2), so digits_size = 2+2 =4? So digits array has indices 0-3. \n\n    digits[0] =0 (from last character '0'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2] =0, digits[3]=0. The loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since len is 2, so i <=2). i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. i=1: digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. So total bills is 1. Third program takes \"1\", first character '1' \u2192 '2' is printed. So output is '2'. That's correct. Now, what about a case where digits[i] is 10?\n\n    Suppose the first program's output is 100. The second program's input is \"100\". digits array for \"100\" is len=3. digits[0] =0 (third character '0'), digits[1] =0 (second '0'), digits[2] =1 (first '1'), digits[3] =0, digits[4] =0 (digits_size is 3+2=5). The loop runs for i from 0 to 3 (since len is 3). Let's see:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=2: digits[2] is 1 \u2192 add 1. i=3:\n\n    digits[3] is 0 \u2192 add 0. So total bills is 1. But wait, perhaps there's a case where digits[i] becomes 10. Let's think of a case where after processing, a digit becomes 10. For example, let's say the input to the second program is \"10\". Wait, in the previous example, it didn't happen. Let me think of a case where digits[i] becomes 10. Suppose the input is \"10\".",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (codeforces_189_A.java). It reads three integers a, b, c and n from input. Then it uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum number of coins needed to make n using a, b, c. The DP array is filled, and the result is printed. The output here is the value dp[n], which is the minimum coins.\n\nThen File 2 (atcoder_ABC155_E.java) takes a string (a number) and processes its digits to compute some bills. The input here is a string, and the output is the bills count. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input for the second? Wait, no, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Wait, but the second program expects a string (number) as input. Hmm, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the first program's output is a number, which becomes the input string for the second. Then the second's output is a number, which is the input to the third. The third program expects a single character? Wait, looking at the third program (atcoder_ABC151_A.java), it reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to it (as a char), and prints that. So the input to the third program is a string, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is a number (bills), so that number is the input string for the third program. The third program then takes the first character of that string and increments it.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output1 (integer) -> Program2 (input is Output1 as a string) -> Output2 (integer) -> Program3 (input is Output2 as a string) -> Output3 (first character +1).\n\nTherefore, the C program must read the initial input (for Program1), process all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into C.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input for Program1: n, a, b, c. The first program's input is four integers: n, a, b, c. Wait, looking at the first Java code:\n\nIn codeforces_189_A.java, the first line is scanner.nextInt() which is n. Then a, b, c are next three. So the input is four integers: n, a, b, c.\n\nSo the first program's input is four integers. The output is the dp[n], which is an integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. The second program expects a string (number) as input. So the first program's output is an integer, which is converted to a string and passed to the second program. The second program processes that string (digits) and outputs another integer (bills). The third program takes that integer as a string, takes the first character, adds 1, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in the C program, the steps are:\n\n- Read the four integers (n, a, b, c) from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (dp[n]).\n\n- Use that result as the input to the second program's processing (the second program's input is a string representation of that integer).\n\n- Compute the second program's result (bills).\n\n- Use that result as the input to the third program's processing (the third program's input is a string of that integer).\n\n- Compute the third program's result (first character +1).\n\n- Output that final character.\n\nNow, translating each Java program into C functions, passing data in memory.\n\nFirst, the first program's code:\n\nThe first Java program uses a dynamic programming approach. Let's see:\n\nThe code initializes an array dp of size maxn (4010) with all elements set to Integer.MIN_VALUE except dp[0] = 0. Then, for each of the three coins (a, b, c), it iterates through the dp array and updates dp[j] as the max between its current value and dp[j - arr[i]] + 1. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins to make n. Wait, actually, the DP here is for the maximum number of coins? Wait, no, the problem might be to find the minimum coins, but the way the DP is structured here is a bit different. Wait, the code uses Math.max, so perhaps it's trying to maximize the number of coins? Wait, maybe the problem is to find the maximum number of coins that sum up to exactly n. Because the recurrence is dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] + 1). So for each coin, you can choose to use it, adding 1 to the count. The initial dp[0] is 0, and others are -infinity. So the DP is trying to find the maximum number of coins that sum to exactly n. So the output is dp[n], which is the maximum coins possible. So the first program's output is that value.\n\nSo in C, I need to replicate this. The maxn is 4010, so the array size is 4010. The initial setup is to set all elements to -infinity except dp[0] =0. Then for each of the three coins, loop through j from arr[i] to maxn, and update dp[j] as the maximum between current and dp[j - arr[i]] +1.\n\nIn C, the equivalent would be:\n\nInitialize an array of integers, size 4010. Set all elements to -infinity (which in C would be INT_MIN, but since we can't have that in C, perhaps use a very small number like -2^30). Wait, but in C, integers can be up to 2^31-1. So for the initial value, set to -2147483647-1? Wait, but in C, the maximum negative is -2147483648 (assuming 32-bit int). So perhaps we can use INT_MIN, but in C, we can use #include <limits.h> and use INT_MIN.\n\nWait, but in the code, the first loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++) dp[i] = ... but actually, the code initializes the entire dp array to Integer.MIN_VALUE except dp[0]. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\nWait, that's a mistake? Because the array is size maxn (4010), but the loop runs up to i <n. So if n is less than 4010, then the rest of the array (from n to 4010) remains uninitialized. Wait, but in Java, the array is initialized to 0 for integers, but the code is setting the first n elements to MIN_VALUE. Wait, no, the code is initializing the array with new int[maxn], which in Java initializes all elements to 0. Then the loop runs from 0 to n-1, setting those to MIN_VALUE. So the rest (from n to 4009) are still 0? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the code has a bug here. Wait, the code's first loop is for (i from 0 to n-1) set dp[i] to MIN_VALUE. But dp[0] is then set to 0. Wait, the code first loops from 0 to n-1, setting dp[i] to MIN_VALUE, then sets dp[0] to 0. So the first element (dp[0]) is set to 0, and the rest up to n-1 are set to MIN_VALUE. The elements from n to maxn-1 are still 0? That can't be correct. Wait, perhaps the code is wrong, but I have to replicate it as is.\n\nWait, the code's first loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\ndp[0] = 0;\n\nSo for indices 0 to n-1, set to MIN except dp[0] is 0. The rest (from n to maxn-1) are 0. So the DP is trying to compute the maximum number of coins to reach exactly n. The way the DP works is that for each coin, you can take it and add 1 to the count. So the recurrence is correct. The initial setup is that dp[0] is 0 (base case), and others are -infinity except those beyond n? Hmm, but the code's initial setup may have a problem. However, since the problem requires replicating the code exactly, I have to follow it.\n\nIn C, the code would be:\n\nint dp[4010];\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[i] = -2147483647 -1; // which is Integer.MIN_VALUE in Java\n}\ndp[0] = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    int coin = arr[i];\n    for (int j = coin; j < 4010; j++) {\n        if (dp[j - coin] + 1 > dp[j]) {\n            dp[j] = dp[j - coin] +1;\n        }\n    }\n}\nint result1 = dp[n];\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop for the coins is for each of the three coins (a, b, c). The array arr is {a, b, c}, so the loop over i from 0 to 2. So in C, the coins are stored in an array, then loop through each.\n\nSo the first part is manageable.\n\nNow, the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E.java):\n\nThis program takes a string (number) as input, processes its digits, and computes bills. The input is a string, which in the sequence comes from the first program's output (the integer result1). So in the C program, the input to the second step is the string representation of result1. So in C, after computing result1, we need to convert it to a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\n- Reads a string (number) from input.\n\n- Converts it into an array of digits in reverse order (digits[0] is the least significant digit, etc.), but with an extra element (digits has length number.length() +1). Wait, the code initializes digits as new int[number.length() +1], then loops over the original digits (from the end of the string to the start). So for each character in the original string, starting from the end (so first character is the last digit of the number), subtract '0' to get the digit. So digits[0] is the units digit, digits[1] is tens, etc. The digits array has an extra element (digits.length is number.length()+1), so digits[number.length()] is initialized to 0? Or not? The loop runs for i from 0 to number.length()-1, so digits[0] to digits[number.length()-1] are set. The digits[number.length()] is not set, so in Java it's initialized to 0 (since arrays are initialized to 0 in Java). Wait, in Java, when you create an int array, all elements are initialized to 0. So digits is initialized with all elements 0, then the loop sets the first number.length() elements (digits[0] to digits[number.length()-1]) to the reversed digits. The digits[number.length()] remains 0.\n\nThen, the bills are computed by iterating over each digit. The code has some logic for handling carries when digits[i] is 10 (which can happen when there's a carry from the previous digit?), but I need to see the code step by step.\n\nThe code:\n\nint bills =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] =0;\n\n    }\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) {\n\n        bills += digits[i];\n\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n        }\n\n        bills +=5;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        bills +=10 - digits[i];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop runs from i=0 to i <= number.length(). Since the digits array has length number.length()+1, the maximum i is number.length(), which is the last element (digits[number.length()] is the carryover beyond the original digits). \n\nThe first condition: if digits[i] is 10, then set it to 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, add to bills. \n\nThe logic here is a bit tricky. Let me think: the problem is probably about converting the number into a minimal number of bills, but the exact problem isn't clear. The code's logic is handling each digit, possibly in a way that when a digit is over 5, it's better to round up and carry over. \n\nIn any case, the code's logic must be replicated in C. \n\nIn the C program, the input to the second step is the integer result1 from the first step. So we need to convert that integer to a string, then process it as per the second program's code.\n\nSo in C, after getting result1, we can convert it to a string. Let's see:\n\nSuppose result1 is an integer. To convert it to a string, we can use sprintf. For example:\n\nchar str[20]; // assuming the number is up to 2^31 which is 10 digits, plus sign, etc.\n\nsprintf(str, \"%d\", result1);\n\nThen, the string is processed as in the second Java program. \n\nWait, but the second program's input is the string as read from input, which is the number as a string. So the input to the second program is exactly the string representation of result1. So in C, we can create that string, then process it.\n\nNow, the second program's processing steps:\n\nFirst, the digits array is built by reversing the string's characters, converting each to digit, and storing in reverse order. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array is filled as:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nWait, the original string is processed from the end to the beginning. So for example, if the string is \"123\", then the first character is '3', then '2', then '1', so digits[0] =3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1. The digits array has length 4 (since number.length() is 3, so digits has 4 elements). The digits[3] is initialized to 0.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\nTake the string (e.g., \"123\"), reverse it, then each character is converted to digit. \n\nWait, the code in Java loops over the original string's characters from the end to the start. So for each i from 0 to len-1, the character at position (len-1 -i) is taken. So for i=0, it's the last character, i=1, the second last, etc. So the digits array is filled in reverse order of the string's digits. \n\nSo in C, to replicate this:\n\nSuppose the string is stored in a char array. Let's say the string is stored in a char array s. The length is len = strlen(s). \n\nThen, the digits array (int array) of size len+1 is initialized to 0. \n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = s[len -1 -i] - '0';\n\n}\n\ndigits[len] remains 0 (since initialized to 0).\n\nThen, the loop over i from 0 to len (inclusive) is done. \n\nWait, the loop in Java is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) which is up to len (since number.length() is the original string's length). \n\nSo in C, the digits array is of size len+1, and the loop runs from 0 to len (inclusive). \n\nThe processing of each digit:\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10. If so, carry over. \n\nWait, how can digits[i] be 10? Because in the first step, digits are set to 0-9. But during the loop, when we process i, we might have a carry from the previous step. For example, if digits[i] was 10, then we set it to 0 and add 1 to digits[i+1]. \n\nWait, the first step in the loop is to check if digits[i] is 10. So perhaps during processing, digits[i] can become 10 due to a carry from a previous digit. \n\nWait, the code's first condition is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n    digits[i+1]++;\n\n    digits[i] =0;\n\n}\n\nSo this handles any digit that is 10, which can only happen if a previous step added a carry. \n\nThen, after that, the code processes the digit's value. \n\nSo in C, the code would be similar. \n\nThe bills variable starts at 0. \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len (inclusive):\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n    digits[i+1]++;\n\n    digits[i] =0;\n\n}\n\nThen, check the digit's value. \n\nWait, but after setting digits[i] to 0, the next steps will process the digit's value. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i:\n\n    if digit is 10, handle carry.\n\n    then, process the digit's value (now 0-9 or 10? No, after handling, it's 0).\n\nWait, after the first condition, the digit is now 0 (if it was 10). \n\nThen, the next conditions are:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) add to bills.\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) add 5, and check next digit for carry.\n\nelse (digits[i] >5) add 10 - digits[i], and carry over.\n\nWait, the code for digits[i] ==5:\n\nif (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    bills +=5;\n\n}\n\nSo when the digit is exactly 5, we add 5 to bills. But also, if the next digit is >=5, we increment it. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. \n\nThe code's logic is a bit involved, but in C, it can be translated directly. \n\nOnce the loop is done, the bills variable is the result of the second program. \n\nThen, the third program takes that result (bills) as input, converts it to a string, takes the first character, adds 1, and outputs it. \n\nThe third Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A.java) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1, and prints it. \n\nSo in C, after getting the second result (bills), we convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, and output that. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n, a, b, c) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (result1 = dp[n]).\n\n3. Convert result1 to a string, process it through the second program's logic to get result2 (bills).\n\n4. Convert result2 to a string, take the first character, add 1, and print it.\n\nNow, let's start coding each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part (codeforces_189_A):\n\nIn C:\n\nWe need to read n, a, b, c.\n\nThen compute the DP array.\n\nThe code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <limits.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, a, b, c;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b, &c);\n    int arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n    const int maxn = 4010;\n    int dp[maxn];\n    // Initialize dp array\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        dp[i] = INT_MIN; // which is -2147483648, but in Java it's -2^31 which is same\n    }\n    dp[0] = 0;\n    for (int i = n; i < maxn; i++) { // the rest are initialized to 0? Wait, in Java, the array is initialized to 0, then the first n elements are set to MIN except dp[0]. Wait, in C, the array is not initialized, so we need to set all elements except first n to 0?\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the dp array is initialized as new int[maxn], which in Java initializes all elements to 0. Then the loop runs for i from 0 to n-1, setting those to MIN. So the elements from n to maxn-1 remain 0. \n\n    So in C, we need to first set all elements to 0, then set the first n elements (except dp[0]) to INT_MIN. \n\n    So:\n\n    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // set all to 0\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        dp[i] = INT_MIN;\n    }\n    dp[0] = 0;\n\n    Then proceed with the loops.\n\n    Then, for each coin in arr:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        int coin = arr[i];\n        for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n            if (dp[j - coin] != INT_MIN && dp[j - coin] + 1 > dp[j]) {\n                dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    Wait, but in Java, the code uses Math.max, so the condition is whether the new value is better. \n\n    The original code in Java:\n\n    dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] + 1);\n\n    So in C, the equivalent is:\n\n    if (dp[j - coin] +1 > dp[j]) then set dp[j] to that value. \n\n    But we have to ensure that dp[j - coin] is not INT_MIN (since if it's -infinity, then adding 1 would be worse). \n\n    So in the loop over j, for each j starting from coin, we check if dp[j - coin] is not INT_MIN. \n\n    So the code inside the inner loop would be:\n\n    if (dp[j - coin] != INT_MIN) {\n        if (dp[j] < dp[j - coin] +1) {\n            dp[j] = dp[j - coin] +1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    So that's important to avoid using invalid values.\n\n    After processing all coins, the result1 is dp[n].\n\n    Now, moving to the second part.\n\n    Once result1 is computed, we need to process it through the second program's logic.\n\n    So:\n\n    int result1 = dp[n];\n\n    Now, convert result1 to a string. \n\n    char str1[20];\n    sprintf(str1, \"%d\", result1);\n\n    Then, process this string as per the second program.\n\n    Let's code that part.\n\n    The second part's processing:\n\n    int len = strlen(str1);\n    int digits[len +1];\n    memset(digits, 0, sizeof(digits)); // all elements 0\n\n    for (int i =0; i < len; i++) {\n        digits[i] = str1[len -1 -i] - '0';\n    }\n\n    // Now process the digits array.\n\n    int bills =0;\n    for (int i=0; i <= len; i++) {\n        if (digits[i] ==10) {\n            digits[i+1]++;\n            digits[i] =0;\n        }\n        // Now process the digit's value\n        if (digits[i] <5) {\n            bills += digits[i];\n        } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n            if (i+1 <= len) { // check if i+1 is within the array\n                if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n            }\n            bills +=5;\n        } else {\n            digits[i+1]++;\n            bills += 10 - digits[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    Wait, but in the loop, when i reaches len (the last element of digits array), then digits[i+1] would be digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    Wait, the digits array is of size len+1, so indices 0 to len. So when i is len, then i+1 is len+1, which is beyond the array. \n\n    So in the case of digits[i] ==5, when i is len, then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. \n\n    Hmm, but in the original Java code, the digits array has length number.length() +1, so when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    Wait, in Java, the digits array is initialized to length number.length() +1, so the maximum index is number.length(). So when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1, which is beyond the array. \n\n    So in the code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. \n\n    But in the code, when processing digits[i] ==5, the code checks digits[i+1] >=5. \n\n    This would cause an array out of bounds in Java. Wait, but in the original code, the loop runs up to i <= number.length(). \n\n    Wait, the original code's loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) which is up to number.length() (since in Java, the loop condition is i < number.length()+1). \n\n    So when i is number.length(), then digits[i] is digits[number.length()], which is the last element of the array (since the array is length number.length()+1). \n\n    Then, digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    So in the code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. \n\n    That's a bug in the original code. But since we have to replicate it exactly, perhaps in the C code, we need to handle that. \n\n    Wait, perhaps in the original code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in Java, that would be an array index out of bounds error. \n\n    Wait, but maybe the code is written correctly. Let me think again. \n\n    The digits array has length number.length() +1. So indices 0 to number.length(). \n\n    So when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1, which is beyond the array. \n\n    So in the code, when processing digits[i] ==5 at i = number.length(), then the code tries to access digits[i+1], which is out of bounds. \n\n    That's a problem. \n\n    Hmm, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches the last element, the digits[i] can't be 5? Or maybe the code is intended to have that. \n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last element, the digits[i] can be 10, but after handling that, it becomes 0, and then the rest of the processing is okay. \n\n    Alternatively, maybe the code is wrong, but since we have to replicate it exactly, we have to proceed as per the code. \n\n    In C, to avoid out of bounds, perhaps when i is the last index (len), then digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in the code, when i is len (the last element of the digits array), then digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    To prevent this, perhaps in the code, when i is the last index, we can't access digits[i+1], so in the case of digits[i] ==5, the code would have an error. \n\n    But since the original code is in Java and it's given, perhaps the code is correct and the problem is that when i is the last index, the digits[i+1] is allowed. \n\n    Wait, in the C code, the digits array is of size len+1 (since len is the length of the string). So digits has indices 0 to len. \n\n    So when i is len, then digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    So in C, to prevent this, perhaps in the case of i == len, we can't access digits[i+1], so in the code, when i is the last index, we have to handle that. \n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the code is intended to have that, and in the case of i being the last index, the digits[i+1] is allowed. \n\n    Hmm, perhaps the code is correct because when the digits array is of size len+1, then digits[i+1] when i is len would be digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    This is a problem. \n\n    Wait, perhaps the original code in Java has a mistake here, but since we have to replicate it exactly, perhaps in the C code, we can proceed as follows: \n\n    When i is the last index (i = len), then digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in the code, when i is len, then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. \n\n    To replicate the Java behavior, perhaps in C, we can set the digits array to have an extra element, but that's getting complicated. \n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last index, the digits[i] can't be 5 or over 5, but that's not necessarily true. \n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the problem is that when i is the last index, the digits[i] can be 10, but after handling that, it becomes 0, and then the rest of the processing is okay. \n\n    Let me think through an example. \n\n    Suppose the input to the second program is \"5\". \n\n    The string is \"5\", so len is 1. \n\n    digits array is of size 2 (0 and 1). \n\n    digits[0] =5, digits[1] =0. \n\n    The loop runs from i=0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\n    For i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 5. \n\n    So first check if it's 10? No. \n\n    Then, since it's 5, check if digits[1] (i+1=1) is >=5. digits[1] is 0, so no. \n\n    So add 5 to bills. \n\n    Then, i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 0. \n\n    So add 0 to bills. \n\n    So total bills is 5. \n\n    So that works. \n\n    Another example: input is \"10\". \n\n    The string is \"10\", len=2. \n\n    digits array is size 3. \n\n    digits[0] =0 (from the last character '0'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2] =0. \n\n    The loop runs for i from 0 to 2. \n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    Total bills 1. \n\n    But what if the digit is 10 at i=2?\n\n    Suppose digits[2] is 10. \n\n    Then, in the first condition, set digits[3] to 1, but digits[3] is beyond the array. \n\n    So in C, this would be a problem. \n\n    Hmm, perhaps the code is intended to have that, but in C, we can't do that. \n\n    To replicate the code exactly, perhaps in C, when i is the last index (len), then digits[i+1] is beyond the array. \n\n    To avoid this, perhaps in the code, when i is the last index, we can't access digits[i+1], so in the case of digits[i] ==5, the code would have an error. \n\n    But since the original code is in Java and it's given, perhaps the code is correct and the problem is that the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] is digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. \n\n    This suggests that the original code has a bug. \n\n    However, since we have to replicate it exactly, perhaps in C, we can proceed by making the digits array one element larger. \n\n    Let me think: in the C code, the digits array is of size len+2, so that digits[i+1] is within the array when i is up to len. \n\n    So:\n\n    int digits[len +2]; \n\n    Then, the loop for filling digits would be:\n\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n        digits[i] = str1[len -1 -i] - '0';\n\n    }\n\n    digits[len] =0; \n\n    digits[len+1] =0; \n\n    Then, the loop runs up to i <= len. \n\n    So when i is len, digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is within the array. \n\n    That way, the code can handle the case where i is the last index. \n\n    So modifying the code:\n\n    int len = strlen(str1);\n    int digits_size = len +2;\n    int digits[digits_size];\n    memset(digits, 0, sizeof(digits));\n\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n        digits[i] = str1[len -1 -i] - '0';\n    }\n\n    Then, the loop:\n\n    for (int i=0; i <= len; i++) { // since digits has len+2 elements, i can go up to len (digits[len] is valid, and i+1 is len+1 which is within digits_size-1 (len+1) )\n\n    So this way, the code can handle the case where i is the last index. \n\n    So this adjustment is necessary to prevent array out of bounds in C. \n\n    So I'll adjust the code accordingly. \n\n    Now, proceeding with the code for the second part.\n\n    After processing, the bills variable holds the result. \n\n    Then, the third part: \n\n    Convert bills to a string, take the first character, add 1, and print. \n\n    So:\n\n    char str2[20];\n    sprintf(str2, \"%d\", bills);\n    if (strlen(str2) ==0) { // unlikely, but handle empty string? }\n    char first_char = str2[0];\n    printf(\"%c\", first_char +1);\n\n    So putting it all together.\n\n    Now, putting all the code into a single C program.\n\n    Let me outline the steps again:\n\n    1. Read n, a, b, c from input.\n\n    2. Compute result1 via DP.\n\n    3. Convert result1 to string, process through second program's logic to get bills (result2).\n\n    4. Convert result2 to string, take first character, add 1, print.\n\n    Now, coding this step by step.\n\n    The full C code would be:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <limits.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        int n, a, b, c;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b, &c);\n        int arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n        const int maxn = 4010;\n        int dp[maxn];\n        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize all to 0\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            dp[i] = INT_MIN;\n        }\n        dp[0] = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n            int coin = arr[i];\n            for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n                if (dp[j - coin] != INT_MIN && dp[j] < dp[j - coin] + 1) {\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        int result1 = dp[n];\n\n        // Process second part\n        char str1[20];\n        sprintf(str1, \"%d\", result1);\n        int len = strlen(str1);\n        int digits_size = len + 2;\n        int digits[digits_size];\n        memset(digits, 0, sizeof(digits));\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            digits[i] = str1[len - 1 - i] - '0';\n        }\n        int bills = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n            if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                if (digits[i + 1] >= 5) {\n                    digits[i + 1]++;\n                }\n                bills += 5;\n            } else {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                bills += 10 - digits[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Process third part\n        char str2[20];\n        sprintf(str2, \"%d\", bills);\n        if (strlen(str2) > 0) {\n            printf(\"%c\", str2[0] + 1);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"0\"); // handle empty string, but unlikely\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    Wait, but in the second part's loop, after handling the digit[i] ==10, we need to process the digit's value again? Or is the first condition part of the loop's processing?\n\n    Looking back at the Java code:\n\n    The code in the loop is:\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    Then, the next conditions are based on the current digits[i], which after the first condition is now 0 (if it was 10). \n\n    So the code is correct as written. \n\n    Also, in the C code, after the first condition, the digit is set to 0, so the next conditions are based on the updated value. \n\n    So the code is okay. \n\n    Now, testing edge cases. \n\n    For example, if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's input is \"0\". \n\n    The second program's processing:\n\n    digits array for \"0\" is len=1, digits[0] =0, digits[1]=0, digits[2]=0 (since digits_size is 3). \n\n    The loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (since len is 1). \n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So bills is 0. \n\n    Then third program takes \"0\", first character is '0', add 1 \u2192 '1' is printed. \n\n    So the output is '1'. \n\n    Which is correct. \n\n    Another test case: first program's output is 5. \n\n    Second program's input is \"5\". \n\n    digits[0] =5, digits[1]=0, digits[2]=0. \n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 5 \u2192 check if digits[1] (0) >=5? No. So add 5 to bills. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=2 (since len is 1, the loop runs up to i=1? Wait, no. Wait, len is 1, so the loop runs from i=0 to i <= len (1). \n\n    So i=0 and 1. \n\n    Wait, len is 1, so the loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\n    So i=0 and 1. \n\n    i=0: as above. \n\n    i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So total bills is 5. \n\n    Third program takes \"5\", first character '5' \u2192 '6' is printed. \n\n    So output is '6'. \n\n    That's correct. \n\n    Another test case: first program's output is 10. \n\n    Second program's input is \"10\". \n\n    digits array for \"10\" is len=2. \n\n    digits[0] =0 (from '0'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2] =0, digits[3] =0 (since digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, len is 2, so digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, no, digits_size is len+2. \n\n    Wait, len is 2, so digits_size is 2+2=4? Wait, no, digits_size = len +2 \u2192 2+2=4? \n\n    Wait, len is the length of the string (2), so digits_size = 2+2 =4? \n\n    So digits array has indices 0-3. \n\n    digits[0] =0 (from last character '0'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2] =0, digits[3]=0. \n\n    The loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since len is 2, so i <=2). \n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So total bills is 1. \n\n    Third program takes \"1\", first character '1' \u2192 '2' is printed. \n\n    So output is '2'. \n\n    That's correct. \n\n    Now, what about a case where digits[i] is 10?\n\n    Suppose the first program's output is 100. \n\n    The second program's input is \"100\". \n\n    digits array for \"100\" is len=3. \n\n    digits[0] =0 (third character '0'), digits[1] =0 (second '0'), digits[2] =1 (first '1'), digits[3] =0, digits[4] =0 (digits_size is 3+2=5). \n\n    The loop runs for i from 0 to 3 (since len is 3). \n\n    Let's see:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\n    i=3:\n\n    digits[3] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So total bills is 1. \n\n    But wait, perhaps there's a case where digits[i] becomes 10. \n\n    Let's think of a case where after processing, a digit becomes 10. \n\n    For example, let's say the input to the second program is \"10\". \n\n    Wait, in the previous example, it didn't happen. \n\n    Let me think of a case where digits[i] becomes 10. \n\n    Suppose the input is \"10\". \n\n    The digits array is as before. \n\n    But let's imagine a case where during processing, a digit becomes 10. \n\n    For example, suppose the input is \"15\". \n\n    The string is \"15\", len=2. \n\n    digits array is size 4 (len+2=4). \n\n    digits[0] =5 (from '5'), digits[1] =1 (from '1'), digits[2]=0, digits[3]=0. \n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 5 \u2192 check if digits[1] (1) >=5? No. So add 5 to bills (bills=5). \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 (bills=6). \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So total bills is 6. \n\n    But what if there's a carry that makes a digit 10?\n\n    Let's try input \"19\". \n\n    The string is \"19\", len=2. \n\n    digits[0] =9, digits[1]=1, digits[2]=0, digits[3]=0. \n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 9 \u2192 since it's >5, add 10-9=1 to bills (bills=1). \n\n    Then, digits[1] is incremented to 2. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 2 \u2192 add 2 (bills=3). \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So total bills 3. \n\n    Now, another example where a digit becomes 10:\n\n    Suppose the input is \"10\". \n\n    Wait, no. Let's think of a case where after processing, a digit becomes 10. \n\n    Let's say the input is \"1000\". \n\n    The digits array would be:\n\n    digits[0] =0 (last '0'), digits[1]=0, digits[2]=0, digits[3]=1, digits[4]=0, digits[5]=0 (since len is 4, digits_size is 6). \n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0: 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=1: 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=2:0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    i=3:1 \u2192 add 1. \n\n    i=4:0 \u2192 add 0. \n\n    So bills is 1. \n\n    Not seeing a case where digits[i] becomes 10. \n\n    Maybe a case where a carry makes it so. \n\n    Let's try input \"55\". \n\n    The string is \"55\", len=2. \n\n    digits[0]=5, digits[1]=5, digits[2]=0, digits[3]=0. \n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 5 \u2192 check digits[1] (5) >=5 \u2192 yes. So digits[1] becomes 6. \n\n    add 5 \u2192 bills=5. \n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is now 6 \u2192 since it's >5, add 10-6=4 \u2192 bills=5+4=9. \n\n    digits[2] is incremented to 1. \n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=10. \n\n    So total bills is 10. \n\n    So that works. \n\n    So the code seems to handle that. \n\n    Now, the third part: converting bills to a string and taking the first character. \n\n    For example, if bills is 10, the string is \"10\", so first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2'. \n\n    So the output is '2'. \n\n    All right. \n\n    Now, the final C code should be as written above. \n\n    I need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and that the code is correct. \n\n    Also, in the first part, the DP array is initialized correctly. \n\n    The first loop sets dp[i] to INT_MIN for i from 0 to n-1, then dp[0] is set to 0. \n\n    The rest of the dp array (from n to maxn-1) are initialized to 0. \n\n    The loops for the coins are correct. \n\n    The second part's digits array is handled with the correct size. \n\n    The third part's string conversion is correct. \n\n    So the final code should work. \n\n    Now, I'll write the code properly formatted."
