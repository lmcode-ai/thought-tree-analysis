  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_669_A):\n  Reads an integer `n` and prints: (n / 3) * 2 + (if n%3==0 then 0 else 1)\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n  Reads a string `S` and then does a computation to count the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nHowever, note the instruction: the output of the first program is used as the input to the next.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs an integer, and the second program expects a string.\n\nLet me clarify the sequence:\n\n1. The first program reads an integer `n` and prints an integer (let's call it `x`).\n2. The second program reads a string `S`. So, the output of the first program (which is an integer) becomes the input string for the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program in the example reads a string of digits and then processes it. The integer `x` from the first program must be converted to a string to serve as the input for the second program.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, we must connect the output of the first (which is an integer printed to stdout) as the input (a string read from stdin) for the second.\n\nBut in the provided Java code, the second program reads a string from stdin. So we have:\n\n  Input to the entire chain: an integer (for the first program)\n  Output of the first program: an integer (printed as a string of digits)\n  Input to the second program: that string of digits\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n  Step 1: Read an integer `n`.\n  Step 2: Compute `x = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`.\n  Step 3: Convert `x` to a string (this becomes the input for the next program).\n  Step 4: Take that string and compute the answer for the second problem (counting substrings divisible by 2019).\n\nBut note: the second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) does not use any input from the user other than the string. So we are going to:\n\n  - Read an integer (let's call it `n`).\n  - Compute `x` as above.\n  - Convert `x` to a string (this string is what the second program will process).\n\nHowever, the second program is designed for a string of digits. The integer `x` is nonnegative (since `n` is nonnegative? from the context of the first problem: n is read as an integer, and the problem likely assumes nonnegative) so we can convert to a string of digits.\n\nBut note: the second program uses:\n   int N = S.length();\n   ... and then processes each character.\n\nSo we must:\n\n  1. Read an integer (the initial input).\n  2. Compute the intermediate integer `x`.\n  3. Convert `x` to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) and use that as the string for the second program.\n\nImportant: The first program in the chain only reads one integer. The second program then reads one string (which comes from the output of the first).\n\nTherefore, the entire C program should:\n\n  - Read an integer (from stdin).\n  - Compute the intermediate integer `x`.\n  - Convert `x` to a string (so we have a string of digits, without any newline or space).\n  - Then, on that string, perform the same operations as the second Java program.\n\nBut note: the second Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D) uses a method that relies on the string being a sequence of digits. We are generating that string from an integer, so it will be a sequence of digits.\n\nHowever, the second program processes the string from the least significant digit? Actually, note the loop:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n        ...\n\nIt starts from the last character (which is the least significant digit) and moves backwards.\n\nBut when we convert an integer to a string, the string is in normal order (most significant first). For example, the integer 123 becomes the string \"123\", where the first character is '1' (most significant) and the last is '3' (least significant).\n\nIn the Java program, the string `S` is provided in the normal order (most significant first). Then the program accesses `S.charAt(N-1-i)` which is the i-th character from the end (i=0: last char, i=1: second last, etc.). This is the same as processing the number from least significant digit to most.\n\nSo the algorithm in the second program is designed for the string in normal order (and it processes from the least significant digit). Therefore, we can generate the string in the normal way (most significant first) and then the program will process it as expected.\n\nSteps for the C program:\n\n  1. Read an integer (let's call it `n`).\n  2. Compute `x = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`. (Note: integer division in C truncates toward zero, but the original Java uses integer division that also truncates toward zero. However, note that `n` is nonnegative? The problem doesn't specify, but the original Java program didn't check for negative. We assume nonnegative as in competitive programming problems. If negative, the modulus operation in Java and C may differ, but the problem says nonnegative? We'll assume nonnegative.)\n\n  3. Convert `x` to a string. We must be cautious because `x` might be zero? Also, we don't want any extra characters.\n\n  4. Then, take that string and do the same as the second Java program.\n\nBut note: the second Java program uses a modulus of 2019 and an array of size 2019. We can do the same in C.\n\nHowever, the second Java program uses:\n\n   mod_arr: an array of length N (the string length) to store the modulus values for the suffixes?\n   mod_cnt: an array of length 2019 to count the frequencies.\n\nThe algorithm:\n\n   It builds the modulus of the number formed by the suffix starting at the end and going backwards (i.e., the suffix of the string, but the string is in normal order). It uses:\n\n      radix = 1\n      for i from 0 to N-1:\n          digit = the i-th digit from the end (i.e., the last digit, then the second last, etc.)\n          tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019\n          if i != 0: tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n          mod_arr[i] = tmp\n          mod_cnt[tmp]++\n          radix = (radix * 10) % 2019\n\n   Then, it adds mod_cnt[0] (because a substring that is divisible by 2019 corresponds to two suffixes that are congruent mod 2019? or a suffix that is 0 mod 2019). Actually, the program does:\n\n        mod_cnt[0]++;   // Why? Because the empty suffix is considered 0? But note the explanation: the program uses the fact that if two suffixes have the same modulus, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019. Also, a substring that starts at the beginning (or is the entire string) and is divisible by 2019 would correspond to a modulus 0 at that position. The mod_cnt[0]++ accounts for the fact that we can have a substring that ends at the beginning (i.e., the empty string at the beginning) so that the entire prefix up to a point is 0 mod 2019.\n\n   Then, for each modulus value, it does:\n\n        ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2\n\n   This counts the pairs of indices (i, j) with the same modulus (the substring from i+1 to j is divisible by 2019).\n\nHow to do in C:\n\n  Step 1: Read integer `n`.\n  Step 2: Compute `x = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 ? 1 : 0)`. Note: in C, if n%3 !=0 then we add 1. But note: if n%3 is 1 or 2? The condition in Java was (n%3 == 0 ? 0 : 1). So we can write:\n\n        int x = (n / 3) * 2;\n        if (n % 3 != 0) {\n            x += 1;\n        }\n\n  Step 3: Convert `x` to a string. We'll use `sprintf` to write the integer to a character array.\n\n        char s[20]; // enough for an integer (max 10 or 11 digits for 32-bit, 20 is safe)\n        sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n\n        Now, the string `s` holds the digits of `x` in normal order.\n\n  Step 4: Let `N = strlen(s)`.\n\n  Step 5: We need to allocate arrays:\n\n        int mod_arr[N];   // But note: variable-length arrays in C are allowed in C99, but we can also use dynamic allocation if we want. However, the string length is at most 20? because x is at most around (n/3)*2+1 and n is an integer. So we can use a fixed size? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the range of n, but we assume it's within the range of an integer. The string will be at most 11 characters for a 32-bit integer. So we can use a fixed array for mod_arr of size 20.\n\n        int mod_cnt[2019] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n\n  Step 6: Then, set:\n\n        int radix = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n            // Get the digit: we want the (N-1-i)-th character of s\n            int digit = s[N-1-i] - '0';\n            int tmp = digit * radix % 2019;\n            if (i != 0) {\n                tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n            }\n            mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n            mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n            radix = (radix * 10) % 2019;\n        }\n\n  Step 7: Then, do:\n\n        mod_cnt[0]++;   // as in the Java program\n\n        long long ans = 0;   // because in Java they used long for ans (which is 64-bit integer). We use long long in C.\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n            ans += (long long)mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2;\n        }\n\n  Step 8: Print `ans`.\n\nBut note: the original first program did I/O and then the second program did I/O. The entire chain: the first program reads an integer and prints an integer (without any extra space) and then the second program reads that integer as a string and prints a long integer.\n\nSo the entire C program should:\n\n  - Read an integer (with scanf)\n  - Compute x\n  - Convert x to a string\n  - Process that string as described\n  - Print the final answer (ans)\n\nHowever, note: the first program in the chain does not output any extra spaces or newlines? It uses `System.out.println`, which prints the integer and then a newline. But the second program uses `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);` and `sc.next()`. The `sc.next()` in Java reads tokens (by default delimited by whitespace). So if the first program prints \"123\\n\", then the next program will read the token \"123\" (without the newline). But note: the `next()` method in Java's Scanner stops at whitespace. So the newline would be left in the input? Actually, the `next()` method skips any leading whitespace and then takes the next token. So the newline is skipped.\n\nHowever, in our C program, we are not actually writing to stdout and then reading from stdin in the middle. We are just processing in memory. So we are converting the integer `x` to a string and then using that string as the input for the second part. Therefore, we don't have a newline in the string.\n\nBut note: the original chain would have the first program outputting the integer and a newline. Then the second program would skip the newline and read the digits. However, if the first program outputs \"123\\n\", then the second program would read the string \"123\". So our string should be \"123\", not \"123\\n\". Therefore, when we convert `x` to a string with `sprintf`, we get a string without a newline. So that matches.\n\nSo the C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read integer n\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      // Step 2: Compute x\n      int x = (n / 3) * 2;\n      if (n % 3 != 0) {\n          x++;\n      }\n\n      // Step 3: Convert x to a string\n      char s[20];\n      sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n      int N = strlen(s);\n\n      // Step 4: Arrays for mod_arr and mod_cnt\n      int mod_arr[N];   // VLA, but N is small (max 20)\n      int mod_cnt[2019] = {0}; // initialize to zeros\n\n      int radix = 1;\n      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n          // Get the i-th digit from the end (i.e., the digit at position N-1-i)\n          int digit = s[N-1-i] - '0';\n          int tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019;\n          if (i != 0) {\n              tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n          }\n          mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n          mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n          radix = (radix * 10) % 2019;\n      }\n\n      mod_cnt[0]++; // for the empty prefix\n\n      long long ans = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n          if (mod_cnt[i] > 1) {\n              // We can use: nC2 = mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2\n              ans += (long long)mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 8: Print the answer\n      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the modulus operations: we are doing modulo 2019, and the numbers are nonnegative. The modulo operation in C for nonnegative numbers is the same as in Java.\n\nHowever, note: the multiplication `(digit * radix)` might be large? But `digit` is between 0 and 9, and `radix` is modulo 2019 (so at most 2018). The product is at most 9*2018 = 18162, which is less than 2e5, so it's safe for 32-bit integers.\n\nAlso, the modulus operation in C for nonnegative numbers is straightforward.\n\nBut note: the condition `if (i != 0)`: we are using `mod_arr[i-1]` which is computed in the previous step.\n\nOne more thing: the Java program uses `long` for `ans` because the answer might be large. We use `long long` in C to be safe.\n\nLet me test with a small example:\n\n  Example from the first program: if n=1, then x = (1/3)*2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 -> string \"1\"\n\n  Then, for the second program with string \"1\":\n\n      N=1\n      i=0: \n          digit = '1' -> 1\n          tmp = 1 * 1 % 2019 = 1\n          i==0 -> no previous\n          mod_arr[0]=1\n          mod_cnt[1] becomes 1\n          radix becomes 10 % 2019 = 10\n\n      Then, mod_cnt[0]++ -> mod_cnt[0] becomes 1, others: mod_cnt[1]=1.\n\n      Then, for each modulus:\n          i=0: 1 * (1-1)/2 = 0\n          i=1: 1 * (1-1)/2 = 0\n          ... and for i=0: mod_cnt[0]=1 -> 1*0/2=0 -> but wait, we also have mod_cnt[0]=1 -> 1*0/2=0 -> total 0.\n\n      However, the answer for the string \"1\" should be: how many substrings divisible by 2019? \n          The substring \"1\" is not divisible by 2019? So 0.\n\n      So the answer 0 is correct.\n\n  Another test: n=3 -> x = (3/3)*2 + 0 = 2 -> string \"2\"\n\n      Then, same as above: mod_arr[0]=2, mod_cnt[2]=1, then mod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n      Then, ans = 0 (for 2) + mod_cnt[0]*(0)/2 = 0 -> total 0.\n\n  Now, n=2019? Actually, we don't need to test the entire chain, but the algorithm for the second part is known from the ABC164D problem.\n\nBut note: the second program was designed for the problem \"ABC164D\" which counts the number of substrings divisible by 2019. However, in our chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first (a number). So the string is a representation of that number.\n\nTherefore, the C program as above should be correct.\n\nHowever, note: the second program in Java did:\n\n        mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n        mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n        and then after the loop: mod_cnt[0]++;\n\n        and then the formula.\n\nBut why mod_cnt[0]++? This is because the empty substring at the beginning is considered to have modulus 0. So we are including the empty prefix. Then, when we count pairs (i, j) such that the modulus at i equals the modulus at j, we get the substrings from i+1 to j. And if a prefix (from 0 to j) has modulus 0, then we can pair the empty prefix at -1 with that prefix? So it's correct.\n\nWe'll write the C program accordingly.\n\nOne caveat: in the first program, the expression (n/3) in C for negative n? But the problem doesn't specify negative. We'll assume nonnegative as in the original problem.\n\nLet me write the entire C program.\n\nNote: We must include the necessary headers.\n\nFinal code:"
