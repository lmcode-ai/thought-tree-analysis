First bulb: k=2, connected to switch1 and switch2 -> so a[0] |= 1<<0 (bit0) and a[1] |= 1<<0 (bit0) -> but wait, the next bulb: k=1, connected to switch2 -> a[1] |= 1<<1 (bit1)\n          Then states: bulb0: 0, bulb1: 1 -> so p = 0<<0 | 1<<1 = 2. Then we iterate over s from 0 to 3:\n          s=0: t=0 -> not 2 -> skip.\n          s=1: switch0 on -> t = a[0] = 1 -> not 2 -> skip.\n          s=2: switch1 on -> t = a[1] = 1<<0 | 1<<1 = 3 -> not 2 -> skip. s=3: both on -> t = a[0]^a[1] = 1 ^ 3 = 2 -> matches -> ans1=1. Then we convert 1 to string \"1\", then the second program:\n          Push '1' -> stack=[1] -> no removal -> count_remove=0 -> output 0. So the chain outputs 0. But the original first program would output 1, and then the second program would read \"1\" and output 0. Therefore, the chain is 0. This matches. Another sample: the example in the problem ABC120_C: \n        Input string: \"1100\" -> removals: 4. But if we get ans1=1100 (which is 1100 in base10) then the string is \"1100\", then the removals: 2 removals? Actually, in the example above we did 2 removals? Then output 4. However, note: the problem ABC120_C: Input: \"1100\" -> removals: 2? because we remove two pairs? Then the answer is 2*2=4. So if the first program outputs 1100, then the chain outputs 4. But 1100 is a large number? The first program's output is the count of subsets, which for N=10 is at most 1024, so 1100 is possible?",

Also note: the first program in Java does:\n\n        for (int s = 0; s < (1 << N); s++) {\n            int t = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (((s >> i) & 1) == 1) {\n                    t ^= a.get(i);\n                }\n            } if (p == t) {\n                ans++;\n            }\n        }\n\n   In C, we do:\n\n        for (int s = 0; s < (1<<N); s++) {\n            int t = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (s & (1 << i)) {   // This checks if the i-th bit is set?

In C, we check by: s & (1<<i) -> which is non-zero if the i-th bit is set. This is equivalent. Therefore, the code is correct.

Then for bulb0: k=2, then s1=1 and s2=2 -> so set a[0] |= (1<<0) -> a[0]=1, and a[1] |= (1<<0) -> a[1]=1. Then bulb1: k=1, then s=2 -> a[1] |= (1<<1) -> a[1] = 1 | 2 = 3.\n\n        Then p: \n            for bulb0: x0=0 -> p |= 0<<0 -> 0.\n            for bulb1: x1=1 -> p |= 1<<1 -> 2. Then subsets:\n            s=0: t=0 -> matches? 0==2 -> no.\n            s=1: (bit0 set) -> t = a[0] = 1 -> no.\n            s=2: (bit1 set) -> t = a[1] = 3 -> no.\n            s=3: both set -> t = a[0]^a[1] = 1^3 = 2 -> matches. So ans1=1. Then we convert 1 to string \"1\", then the second program: \n            push '1' -> then no removal -> count_remove=0 -> output 0. So the program outputs 0. We write the C program accordingly. One more note: the first program reads M bulbs, and then M integers for the states. The states are read in the order of the bulbs (which are from 0 to M-1). The bulb index corresponds to the bit index. We do:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            p |= (x << i);\n        }\n\n   This matches the Java program. Therefore, we output the C program as below.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n The first program (atcoder_ABC128_C) reads integers N and M, then builds a list `a` of integers of size N (each element is a bitmask over M bits),\n and then an integer `p` which is a bitmask of M bits. It then counts the number of subsets s (from 0 to 2^N - 1) such that the XOR of the selected\n elements from `a` equals `p`.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC120_C) reads a string and then counts the number of adjacent removals of \"01\" or \"10\". The answer is the count * 2.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is to be translated: the output of the first program is a single integer (ans) which is printed by the first program.\n Then the second program reads a string (from stdin originally, but now the output of the first program becomes the input of the second).\n\n But wait: the first program outputs an integer (ans) and the second program expects a string. So we must adjust.\n\n However, reading the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program.\n\n But the second program reads a string. So we must convert the integer output of the first program to a string and then feed it to the second program.\n\n How the second program works:\n   It reads a string `x` and then uses a stack to remove adjacent pairs of '0' and '1'. Specifically, it counts the number of pairs that can be removed.\n   The answer is the count * 2.\n\n However, note: the second program's input is a string of '0's and '1's? But the first program outputs an integer (so a sequence of digits, but in base 10).\n\n This does not match. Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\n Let me read the original problem statements to understand what the intended chain is.\n\n But the problem says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n Without the context of the problems, we must rely on the code.\n\n The first program (ABC128_C) is from: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc128/tasks/abc128_c\n   It solves: There are N switches and M bulbs. Each bulb is connected to some switches. We are given the connections and the state (on/off) for each bulb.\n   We count the number of switch combinations that turn on all the bulbs.\n\n The second program (ABC120_C) is from: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc120/tasks/abc120_c\n   It solves: Given a string of '0's and '1's, we can remove any adjacent \"01\" or \"10\" as many times as we want. The maximum number of removals is the answer.\n\n However, the output of the first program is an integer (the count) and the second program expects a string of '0's and '1's. This does not chain.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are independent and the problem is to run them in sequence on the same input? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the two programs are to be run on two different inputs? But the instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After re-examining the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we have to design:\n\n   Read the input for the first program (which is integers N, M, then the connections and the states).\n   Run the first program's logic to get an integer `ans1`.\n   Then use `ans1` as the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s.\n\n However, note that the second program does not use any other input. So the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program, and then the output of the entire chain is the output of the second program.\n\n But the output of the first program is an integer. How do we feed it to the second program? We must convert it to a string.\n\n The second program's input is the string representation of the integer. For example, if the first program outputs 5, then the second program's input is the string \"5\".\n\n However, the second program is designed to remove adjacent \"01\" and \"10\". The string \"5\" is a single digit (or multiple digits) that are in base 10. The removal operation is defined on the characters '0' and '1'. So if the integer has digits other than 0 and 1, then the removal won't occur? \n\n But note: the second program's logic:\n\n   if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1'))\n\n So it only removes when there is a '0' and '1' adjacent. If the integer string has, for example, '5', then it will not be removed.\n\n Therefore, the second program's output would be the same as the input string? Because it only removes adjacent 0 and 1.\n\n But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" must behave identically.\n\n However, the original chain would be:\n\n   $ java atcoder_ABC128_C < input.txt > temp.txt\n   $ java atcoder_ABC120_C < temp.txt\n\n The input to the second program is the string representation of the integer (with base 10) from the first program.\n\n But the second program is designed for a string of 0s and 1s. This is a mismatch.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way? Or perhaps there is a misunderstanding.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended to run the two programs on the same input? But the instruction says the output of the first is the input of the second.\n\n Without more context, we must stick to the given code.\n\n How about we reinterpret the problem: the entire set of inputs for the chain is the input for the first program. Then the chain produces the output of the second program.\n\n But the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s. However, the first program outputs an integer. So we must convert that integer to a string (of base 10 digits) and then feed that string to the second program.\n\n Then the second program will process that base10 string and remove any adjacent \"01\" or \"10\". The answer is the count of such removals multiplied by 2.\n\n However, note that the second program does:\n\n   c = 0\n   for each character in the string:\n        push the character\n        while stack size > 1:\n            pop two: p and q\n            if (p and q are '0' and '1' in any order) -> remove them and increment c, and then continue (so try again with the new top and the next character? Actually, it breaks after the first removal in the inner while? Actually, the inner while breaks after one removal? Because after removal, it continues the inner while? Actually, the inner while condition is `s.size()>1` and after removal, the stack has two less and then we push nothing? and then we break? Actually, no:\n\n          After popping two, if they form a pair, we remove them (so we do not push them back) and then we continue the inner while (so we try again with the next two at the top). Otherwise, we break the inner while.\n\n        But note: the inner while runs until we break. So it will keep popping pairs until it can't.\n\n   Actually, the inner while is:\n\n        while (s.size()>1) {\n            pop two: p and q\n            if (p and q are a removable pair) -> remove them (so we don't push back) and c++ and then continue the while (so we check the new top two? because we break the current iteration and the while condition is rechecked)\n            else -> push them back and break the while.\n\n   So effectively, the stack is processed until the top two are not removable, then we break.\n\n   However, note that the stack might have more than two? Then we only remove one pair at a time? Actually, no: the while loop continues until we break, so we remove as many adjacent pairs as possible from the top? But the stack is a LIFO, so we are only looking at the top two.\n\n   Example: if the stack is [ ... , a, b] and we push a new character c, then we check (b, c). Then if we remove them, we get a new top a, and then we check (a, ...) with the next one? Actually, we break the inner while after one removal? Because we do:\n\n        s.pop() and s.pop() -> now the stack has the element below the two we popped. Then we do `c++` and then `continue` (so we go to the top of the while loop, and check if the stack size is still >1). So we can remove multiple pairs.\n\n   So it's a greedy removal from the top of the stack.\n\n   Now, the problem: the input string for the second program is the string representation of the integer from the first program.\n\n   However, the removal operation is defined for '0' and '1'. So if the integer string contains only the digits '0' and '1', then we can remove pairs. Otherwise, we cannot remove non-01 pairs.\n\n   But the integer from the first program can be any number between 0 and 2^N (N up to 10, so maximum 2^10=1024). So the string representation of the integer will be in base10 and may contain digits from '0' to '9'.\n\n   Therefore, the second program will remove every adjacent pair of '0' and '1' (in any order) until it can't. Then the output is the count * 2.\n\n   However, the original chain would do:\n\n        First program: reads the input and outputs an integer (say 5 -> \"5\")\n        Second program: reads \"5\", then the stack operations:\n            push '5' -> stack = ['5'] -> no while (size=1) -> then next? but the string is only one char.\n\n        Then the while loop in the second program never runs? So c=0, then output 0.\n\n   But if the integer is 10, then the string is \"10\". Then:\n\n        push '1': stack = ['1']\n        push '0': stack = ['1','0'] -> now size>1 -> pop: p='0', q='1' -> they form a pair? (p='0' and q='1') -> condition: (p=='0' and q=='1') -> true -> remove, c=1, then continue the inner while: now stack is empty -> break inner while.\n\n        Then output c*2 = 2.\n\n   However, the original first program's output is the number of switch combinations that turn on all the bulbs. How does that relate to the second program?\n\n   Without the problem statement, we cannot know if this chain is intended. But we are instructed to chain the two programs.\n\n   So we must do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N, M, then the connections and the states).\n        Step 2: Compute the integer `ans1` as in the first program.\n        Step 3: Convert `ans1` to a string (base10 representation). This string becomes the input to the second program.\n        Step 4: Run the second program's logic on that string to compute `c` (the count of removable pairs) and then output `c * 2`.\n\n   However, note the second program uses a stack and a while loop that may remove multiple pairs in a row.\n\n   We are to write a single C program that does:\n\n        Read the input for the first program (from stdin).\n        Process the first program without I/O (so no printing the intermediate integer).\n        Then convert the integer to a string (without printing, just as an internal step).\n        Then run the second program's logic on that string (without reading from stdin again, because the input for the second program is the string we just created).\n        Then output the result (c * 2) to stdout.\n\n   Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        // We'll define a stack for the second part.\n\n        int main() {\n            // Part 1: First program (ABC128_C)\n\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            // We'll create an array `a` of integers (size N)\n            int *a = (int*)calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int k;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {\n                    int s;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &s);\n                    s--; // convert to 0-indexed\n                    a[s] |= (1 << i);\n                }\n            }\n\n            int p = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int x;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n                p |= (x << i);\n            }\n\n            int ans1 = 0;\n            // Iterate over all subsets of [0, N-1]\n            for (int s = 0; s < (1 << N); s++) {\n                int t = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    if ((s >> i) & 1) {\n                        t ^= a[i];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (t == p) {\n                    ans1++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now, ans1 is the integer result from the first program.\n\n            // Part 2: Convert ans1 to a string (base10)\n            char str[20]; // 2^10 is 1024 -> max 4 digits, but let's be safe: 20 chars.\n            sprintf(str, \"%d\", ans1);\n            // Now, str holds the input for the second program.\n\n            // Part 3: Second program (ABC120_C) on the string `str`\n            // We'll simulate the stack for the second program.\n\n            // Instead of using a stack, we can use an array and a top pointer.\n            char stack[1000]; // We don't know the length, but the string is at most 20, so 1000 is safe.\n            int top = -1;\n            int c = 0;\n\n            for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                // Push the current character\n                stack[++top] = str[i];\n                while (top >= 1) { // at least two elements\n                    char p = stack[top];\n                    char q = stack[top-1];\n                    // Check if they form a removable pair: (p and q are '0' and '1' in any order)\n                    if ((p == '0' && q == '1') || (p == '1' && q == '0')) {\n                        // Remove the top two\n                        top -= 2; // pop twice\n                        c++;\n                        // And continue the while to check the new top two\n                    } else {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // The result for the second program is c * 2\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", c * 2);\n\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the second program in Java uses a stack and a while loop that breaks when the top two are not removable. Our simulation above does the same.\n\n   But the Java code does:\n\n        for each char in the string:\n            push the char\n            while (stack size > 1) {\n                pop two: p and q\n                if removable -> remove (so don't push back) and c++ and continue the while (so we check the new top two)\n                else -> push them back and break.\n\n        In our simulation, we are not popping and then pushing back if not removable? We are checking without popping? Actually, we are looking at the top two without popping. Then if removable, we pop by reducing the top by two. Otherwise, we break.\n\n        But the Java code pops and then if not removable, pushes back. So the stack is unchanged and we break.\n\n        Our simulation: we don't pop until we are sure they are removable? Actually, we are just looking at the top two. Then if removable, we pop by setting top -=2. Otherwise, we break.\n\n        This is equivalent because we never actually removed the two until we know they are removable.\n\n        But the Java code does remove them (pop) and then checks. Then if not removable, it pushes back. So the state of the stack after the inner while is the same as if we didn't pop? Actually, no: they popped and then pushed back. So the stack is unchanged.\n\n        Our simulation: we leave the two in place if not removable? Because we break without popping.\n\n        So the state of the stack is the same? Actually, yes: we never popped the two if they are not removable. So the stack remains with the two elements.\n\n        Therefore, our simulation is equivalent.\n\n   However, note: the Java code pops the two and then if not removable, pushes back in the reverse order? Because it pops and then pushes the same two? Actually, it pops the top (p) then the next (q). Then it pushes q then p? \n\n        s.pop() -> p\n        s.pop() -> q\n        then if not removable: \n            s.push(q);\n            s.push(p);\n\n        So the order is preserved.\n\n        In our array-based stack, we have:\n\n            stack[top] = p (the last pushed, which is the current character)\n            stack[top-1] = q (the previous top)\n\n        Then if we do top -=2, we remove both.\n\n        If we don't remove, we leave them. So we don't change the order.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to do anything else.\n\n   But note: the Java code breaks the inner while after one non-removable pair? Actually, no: it breaks the inner while after one iteration (whether removable or not) if not removable? Because if not removable, it pushes back and breaks. But if removable, it doesn't break and continues the while (so it checks the new top two).\n\n        Our simulation: in the while loop, we break only when we find a non-removable pair? Actually, no: we break the inner while only when the top two are not removable? And then we break the inner while. But if they are removable, we remove them and then the while condition is checked again (with top now reduced by two). So it's the same.\n\n   Therefore, the above C program should work.\n\n   However, note the constraints: the first program has N up to 10, so 2^10=1024 iterations. The string for the second program is at most 4 or 5 digits. So the inner while loop in the second part is safe.\n\n   Let me test with the example: \n        First program: if the input is such that ans1=10, then the string is \"10\".\n        Then in the second part:\n            i=0: push '1' -> stack = ['1'] -> top=0 -> while condition: top>=1? no -> next.\n            i=1: push '0' -> stack = ['1','0'] -> top=1 -> while: check top-1 and top: '1' and '0' -> removable -> remove: top becomes -1? Actually, top becomes 1-2 = -1? Then while condition: top>=1? false -> break.\n\n            Then c=1 -> output 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Another example: ans1=101 -> string \"101\"\n        i0: push '1' -> stack[0]='1', top=0 -> no while.\n        i1: push '0' -> stack[0]='1', stack[1]='0', top=1 -> while: check stack[0] and stack[1]: '1' and '0' -> removable -> remove: top=1-2 = -1 -> then while: top>=1? false -> break. Then c=1.\n        i2: push '1' -> stack[0]='1' (because we start from scratch? Actually, the stack was emptied, so we push at index0: stack[0]='1', top=0 -> no while.\n\n        Then c=1 -> output 2.\n\n        But the original Java for the second program would:\n\n            Start: push '1' -> stack: [1]\n            Then push '0': stack: [1,0] -> then pop: p=0, q=1 -> removable -> remove, c=1, and then stack is empty -> break inner while.\n            Then push '1': stack: [1] -> no inner while.\n\n            Then output 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   But what if the string is \"1100\":\n        Step0: push '1' -> stack: [1] -> no while.\n        Step1: push '1' -> stack: [1,1] -> while: pop two: 1 and 1 -> not removable -> push back and break. Then stack: [1,1] -> c=0.\n        Step2: push '0' -> stack: [1,1,0] -> then pop: 0 and 1 -> removable? (0 and 1) -> yes. Then remove the last two: so stack becomes [1] and c=1. Then while: stack has [1] -> size=1 -> break.\n        Step3: push '0' -> stack: [1,0] -> then pop: 0 and 1 -> removable -> remove, c=2 -> stack empty -> break.\n\n        Then output 4.\n\n        In our simulation:\n\n            i0: push '1' -> top=0 -> no while.\n            i1: push '1' -> top=1 -> check: stack[0]='1', stack[1]='1' -> not removable -> break inner while -> stack remains [1,1] and top=1.\n            i2: push '0' -> top=2 -> stack: [1,1,0] -> check top two: stack[1]='1', stack[2]='0' -> removable -> remove: top=0 -> then while: top>=1? (0>=1 false) -> break.\n                   then c=1.\n            i3: push '0' -> top=1 -> stack: [1,0] -> check: stack[0]='1', stack[1]='0' -> removable -> remove: top=-1 -> then while: false -> break. c=2.\n\n            Then output 4.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious about the stack in the second part: the stack size might be up to the length of the string? Actually, the string is at most 20, so we are safe.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the first program might have M up to 10? So the bit masks are 10 bits. The integer `ans1` can be as large as 2^10=1024, so the string has at most 4 digits.\n\n   So we can use a fixed-size stack.\n\n   Code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            // Part 1: Read the input for the first program\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            int *a = (int *)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                a[i] = 0;\n            }\n\n            // Read the M switches for each bulb\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int k;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {\n                    int s;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &s);\n                    s--; // 0-indexed\n                    a[s] |= (1 << i);\n                }\n            }\n\n            int p = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int x;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n                p |= (x << i);\n            }\n\n            int ans1 = 0;\n            // Iterate over all subsets of the N switches\n            for (int s = 0; s < (1<<N); s++) {\n                int t = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    if (s & (1 << i)) {\n                        t ^= a[i];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (t == p) {\n                    ans1++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Convert ans1 to a string\n            char str[20];\n            sprintf(str, \"%d\", ans1);\n\n            // Part 2: Process the string with the second program's logic\n            char stack[20]; // stack for characters, size 20 is enough\n            int top = -1;\n            int count_remove = 0;\n\n            for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                stack[++top] = str[i];\n                while (top >= 1) { // at least two elements\n                    char top_char = stack[top];\n                    char next_char = stack[top-1];\n                    if ((top_char == '0' && next_char == '1') || (top_char == '1' && next_char == '0')) {\n                        // Remove the top two\n                        top -= 2;\n                        count_remove++;\n                        // Continue checking the new top two in the while loop\n                    } else {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", count_remove * 2);\n\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Let me test with the example from the first program: the sample input from ABC128_C\n\n   Sample input for ABC128_C:\n        2 2\n        2 1 2\n        1 2\n        0 1\n\n        Explanation: \n          N=2 switches, M=2 bulbs.\n          First bulb: k=2, connected to switch1 and switch2 -> so a[0] |= 1<<0 (bit0) and a[1] |= 1<<0 (bit0) -> but wait, the next bulb: k=1, connected to switch2 -> a[1] |= 1<<1 (bit1)\n          Then states: bulb0: 0, bulb1: 1 -> so p = 0<<0 | 1<<1 = 2.\n\n        Then we iterate over s from 0 to 3:\n          s=0: t=0 -> not 2 -> skip.\n          s=1: switch0 on -> t = a[0] = 1 -> not 2 -> skip.\n          s=2: switch1 on -> t = a[1] = 1<<0 | 1<<1 = 3 -> not 2 -> skip.\n          s=3: both on -> t = a[0]^a[1] = 1 ^ 3 = 2 -> matches -> ans1=1.\n\n        Then we convert 1 to string \"1\", then the second program:\n          Push '1' -> stack=[1] -> no removal -> count_remove=0 -> output 0.\n\n        So the chain outputs 0.\n\n   But the original first program would output 1, and then the second program would read \"1\" and output 0.\n\n   Therefore, the chain is 0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Another sample: the example in the problem ABC120_C: \n        Input string: \"1100\" -> removals: 4.\n\n        But if we get ans1=1100 (which is 1100 in base10) then the string is \"1100\", then the removals: 2 removals? Actually, in the example above we did 2 removals? Then output 4.\n\n        However, note: the problem ABC120_C: \n            Input: \"1100\" -> removals: 2? because we remove two pairs? Then the answer is 2*2=4.\n\n        So if the first program outputs 1100, then the chain outputs 4.\n\n   But 1100 is a large number? The first program's output is the count of subsets, which for N=10 is at most 1024, so 1100 is possible? Actually, 1100 is greater than 1024? 1024 is the maximum? So we won't get 1100.\n\n   But the point is that the chain is implemented correctly.\n\n   Therefore, the C program is as above.\n\n   However, note: the first program in Java uses an ArrayList, and we used an array.\n\n   Also note: the first program in Java does:\n\n        for (int s = 0; s < (1 << N); s++) {\n            int t = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (((s >> i) & 1) == 1) {\n                    t ^= a.get(i);\n                }\n            }\n            if (p == t) {\n                ans++;\n            }\n        }\n\n   In C, we do:\n\n        for (int s = 0; s < (1<<N); s++) {\n            int t = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (s & (1 << i)) {   // This checks if the i-th bit is set? But note: the Java code shifts s to the right by i and then checks the LSB.\n                    t ^= a[i];\n                }\n            }\n            ...\n        }\n\n   However, in Java, the loop variable i goes from 0 to N-1, and it checks the i-th bit (by shifting s right by i and then AND with 1). In C, we check by: s & (1<<i) -> which is non-zero if the i-th bit is set.\n\n   This is equivalent.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me run the sample input of ABC128_C:\n\n        Input: \n            2 2\n            2 1 2\n            1 2\n            0 1\n\n        We read: N=2, M=2.\n\n        Then for bulb0: k=2, then s1=1 and s2=2 -> so set a[0] |= (1<<0) -> a[0]=1, and a[1] |= (1<<0) -> a[1]=1.\n        Then bulb1: k=1, then s=2 -> a[1] |= (1<<1) -> a[1] = 1 | 2 = 3.\n\n        Then p: \n            for bulb0: x0=0 -> p |= 0<<0 -> 0.\n            for bulb1: x1=1 -> p |= 1<<1 -> 2.\n\n        Then subsets:\n            s=0: t=0 -> matches? 0==2 -> no.\n            s=1: (bit0 set) -> t = a[0] = 1 -> no.\n            s=2: (bit1 set) -> t = a[1] = 3 -> no.\n            s=3: both set -> t = a[0]^a[1] = 1^3 = 2 -> matches.\n\n        So ans1=1.\n\n        Then we convert 1 to string \"1\", then the second program: \n            push '1' -> then no removal -> count_remove=0 -> output 0.\n\n        So the program outputs 0.\n\n   We write the C program accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the first program reads M bulbs, and then M integers for the states. The states are read in the order of the bulbs (which are from 0 to M-1). The bulb index corresponds to the bit index.\n\n   We do:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            p |= (x << i);\n        }\n\n   This matches the Java program.\n\n   Therefore, we output the C program as below."
