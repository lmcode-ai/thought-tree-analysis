But the code is standard. Let me check an example: \n            K=7: The code: K % 7==0 -> K=1\n                    then K=9\n                then we compute the multiplicative order of 10 mod 9 -> which is 1 (since 10 mod 9=1) -> so n=1. But the smallest repunit divisible by 7 is 111111 (n=6). This indicates the code is flawed?

The solution we have is: if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n            K = K / gcd(K, 9);   // because R_n * 9 = 10^n-1, so we require 9*K | 10^n-1? Then we want the order of 10 modulo K (if K is coprime with 10) but then multiplied by 9? Actually, the known solution: if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n            long x = 1;\n            int res = 0;\n            do {\n                res++;\n                x = (x * 10) % K;\n            } while (x!=1); But that is for the modulus being K?

After checking the sample: Input: 7 -> output: 6. Our code for K=7: \n            if (K%2==0 || K%5==0) -> no. if (K%7==0) -> yes -> K=1. then K=9. remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so we break the loop and return 1. This is wrong. The correct approach: \n            We are to find the smallest n such that (10^n-1)/9 is divisible by K.\n\n            => 10^n \u2261 1 (mod 9K) [if 9K and 10 are coprime?] But note: if K has factors 2 or 5, then 9K is not coprime with 10 -> no solution. The known solution: \n                Let M = 9*K.\n                Then we require 10^n \u2261 1 (mod M/gcd(M,10^\u221e))? Actually, we can set M = 9*K, and then if gcd(M,10) ! = 1, then we cannot have 10^n \u2261 1 mod M? But wait, we removed 2 and 5 from K? The code condition: if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n\n            Then we remove the factor of 7? Why 7? Looking at the sample: \n            K=7: \n                The standard solution (from known) is 6. The known solution in the code we are given: \n                if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n                then M = 9*K.\n\n            For K=7: M=9. Then we want the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9: \n                10^1 mod 9 = 1 -> so order=1. But then the repunit: \n                R_1 = 1 -> 1 is divisible by 7? No. So the given Java program is flawed for K=7. How did the original atcoder_ABC174_C pass? I checked the sample: Input: 7 -> Output: 6. The code I see in the sample above is not the standard one.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K and computes a value which is printed.\n\nSecond program (codeforces_8_B) reads a string and then processes it to output either \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nHowever, note that the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut the first program outputs an integer and the second program expects a string. This mismatch must be resolved.\n\nLooking at the two programs:\n\nThe first program outputs an integer (which might be -1 or a positive integer).\n\nThe second program expects a string of characters (only 'L','R','U','D').\n\nTherefore, the chain as described (using the output of the first as input to the second) doesn't make sense.\n\nBut note the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nWe must assume that the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program (an integer K) and the output of the entire chain is the output of the second program (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\").\n\nBut how do we connect the integer output of the first program to the string input of the second?\n\nWe must reinterpret the problem: the two programs are meant to run in sequence, meaning the output of the first is the input to the second. However, the second program expects a string of moves. The first program outputs an integer that is the length of the sequence? Or perhaps we are to generate a string of moves of length equal to the integer?\n\nBut the second program expects a string of characters that are only 'L','R','U','D'. The integer output by the first program (if positive) is the answer, which is the length of the minimal sequence of digits (all 1's) that form a multiple of K. However, that integer is not a string of moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not connected by the output of the first being the input of the second? But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two programs are independent and the input to the chain is both the integer for the first and the string for the second? But the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\", meaning we read all input at the beginning.\n\nBut the two programs read from standard input independently. The first reads an integer, the second reads a string.\n\nSo the entire chain should read both inputs? But then how are they connected? The problem says the output of the first is the input to the next.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the two programs are not meant to be connected by data? But that contradicts the problem.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nWe must assume that the output of the first program (an integer) is transformed into a string that the second program can process. How?\n\nThe second program expects a string of moves. The integer we get from the first program is the answer (say n). We need to generate a string of moves of length n? But what moves? The problem does not specify.\n\nAlternatively, note that the second program does not use the integer at all. It uses a string. So perhaps the chain is:\n\nInput: integer K and a string s (for the second program)? But the first program only reads K and the second only reads s.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" meaning we read all input at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the input to the entire chain is two tokens: first the integer K (for the first program) and then the string (for the second program). Then the chain runs:\n\n1. The first program takes K and produces an integer n (which we don't use for the second program?).\n2. The second program takes the string and produces \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nBut then the output of the first is not used as input to the second.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the first program (an integer) is converted to a string and that string is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string of characters that are only 'L','R','U','D'. The integer output (say 123) would be the string \"123\", which contains characters that are not in the set. Then the second program would break.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the two programs are independent and the input to the chain is two parts: first the integer for the first program, then the string for the second program. Then the chain runs:\n\n1. The first program runs and outputs an integer (which we ignore for the second program).\n2. The second program runs using the string we read at the beginning and outputs \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nBut that does not use the output of the first as input to the second.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem is to run the two programs in sequence without passing data? Then the input is first the integer and then the string? And the output of the chain is the output of the second program? But then the first program's output would be printed and then the second program would read that output? But the problem says without I/O in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, we read the integer and the string at the beginning. Then we run the first program's logic to get an integer n, then we run the second program's logic on the string. Then we output the result of the second program.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". We are not using n in the second program.\n\nAfter careful thought, I notice that the two programs are from different problems and are unrelated. Therefore, the intended chain might be:\n\nInput: integer K (for the first program) and then a string s (for the second program).\n\nThe chain:\n\n1. First program takes K and produces n (which we must not output until the end? but the problem says only the last block produces output) and we don't output n. Then we pass n to the second program? but the second program expects a string.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be misstated. However, I found the original problems:\n\nFirst program: atcoder_ABC174_C\nProblem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc174/tasks/abc174_c\nIt reads an integer K and outputs the length of the minimal repunit that is divisible by K, or -1 if none exists.\n\nSecond program: codeforces_8_B\nProblem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/8/B\nIt reads a string of moves (LRUD) and checks if the path is \"crossing\" (if there is a shortcut that would have caused a collision) and outputs \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nThey are independent.\n\nGiven the instructions, I think the intended meaning is that the entire input is read at the beginning, then both programs run on their respective inputs (which are both provided in the input), and then the output of the second program is the final output? But then the output of the first is ignored? That doesn't match \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAlternatively, the input to the chain is the integer K. Then the first program runs and produces an integer n. Then we generate a string of moves of length n? But how? The moves are arbitrary? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nThis is a critical issue.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nTherefore, we must connect the output of the first (an integer) to the input of the second (a string). We can convert the integer to a string. But the second program expects a string of moves. The integer string might not be a valid move string. So we must interpret the integer as a sequence of moves? How?\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs 3, then we could generate a string of 3 moves? But what moves? We have to choose arbitrarily? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, the integer n is the length of the move string for the second program? But then we need to read a string of that length? But we don't have that in the input.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think there might be a mistake in the problem description.\n\nHowever, note the example: the first program might output -1. Then if we pass the string \"-1\" to the second program, the second program would try to interpret the characters '-' and '1' as moves, which are invalid (only L,R,U,D). The second program would break.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended chain is not possible. But the problem says to do it.\n\nAfter re-thinking, perhaps the problem is to run the first program and then ignore its output and run the second program on the next token of input. That is:\n\nThe input is:\n<integer K>\n<string s>\n\nThen the chain:\n\n1. First program runs on K and produces an integer (which we ignore).\n2. Second program runs on s and produces \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nAnd the final output is the output of the second program.\n\nThis matches the requirement that the entire input is read by the first block (we read both K and s at the beginning) and the final output is by the last block.\n\nBut the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". In this interpretation, we are not using the output of the first program. We are using the next token of input for the second program.\n\nBut the problem says \"without I/O in the middle\", meaning we cannot do additional reads in the second program. So we must read all input at the beginning.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. Read the integer K (for the first program) and the string s (for the second program) at the beginning.\n2. Run the logic of the first program on K to get an integer result (but we don't use it for anything).\n3. Run the logic of the second program on the string s to get a result (\"OK\" or \"BUG\").\n4. Output the result of the second program.\n\nBut then the output of the first program is not used as input to the second. This violates the requirement.\n\nAlternatively, we use the output of the first program to generate a move string? But how? The original problems don't specify a connection.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I will assume that the input to the entire system is two tokens: an integer and then a string. The first program processes the integer and the second program processes the string, and the output of the second program is the final output. The output of the first program is ignored because the problem doesn't specify how to connect them.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". If we ignore the first program's output, that is a problem.\n\nAnother idea: the first program's output is printed, and then the second program reads from standard input again, but the problem says \"without I/O in the middle\". So we cannot do that.\n\nTherefore, I think the only sensible way is to assume that the entire input is read at the beginning, and then we run both programs independently. The output of the first program is not used by the second program. But then the requirement of using the output of the first as input to the second is not met.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo we must connect them. The only way is to convert the integer output of the first program to a string and feed that to the second program.\n\nBut the second program expects moves. How to convert an integer to moves? We could map digits to moves:\n\nFor example:\n0 -> 'R'\n1 -> 'L'\n2 -> 'U'\n3 -> 'D'\nBut then what about negative numbers? The first program can output -1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the absolute value and then convert each digit. But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs either -1 or a positive integer (the answer). If it is -1, then we have a negative sign and a digit. We can ignore the negative sign? or map it to a move? But the move set is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip the second program if the first program outputs -1? But the problem doesn't say.\n\nGiven the above, I think there is a mistake in the problem. But since we must provide an answer, I will assume that the second program is run on the string representation of the output of the first program. This might cause the second program to fail (if the string contains characters not in {'L','R','U','D'}), but we run it anyway.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the integer K (for the first program).\n2. Run the first program's logic to get an integer n.\n3. Convert n to a string (call it s). This string will be the input to the second program.\n4. Run the second program's logic on the string s.\n5. Output the result (\"OK\" or \"BUG\").\n\nThis satisfies:\n- Only the first block reads input (just K).\n- Only the last block produces output (the result of the second program).\n- The output of the first program (n) is used as input to the second program (by converting to string).\n\nBut note: the second program expects only the characters 'L','R','U','D'. If the string s contains any other character, the second program will still run, but it will have undefined behavior? Actually, the second program only reacts to these four characters. For any other character, it would not change x and y? But in the switch statement, other characters are ignored? Let me check the second program:\n\nThe second program:\n        for (i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {\n            switch (ch[i]) {\n                case 'L': --x; break;\n                case 'R': ++x; break;\n                case 'U': ++y; break;\n                case 'D': --y; break;\n            }\n            ... record (x,y) ...\n        }\n\nSo if the character is not one of these, it does nothing, but still records the same (x,y) again? Then the path will have repeated points? That might cause a false \"BUG\".\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs -1, then the string is \"-1\". The characters are '-' and '1'. \n- '-' is not a move -> no change.\n- '1' is not a move -> no change.\n\nSo the path is:\n(0,0) [start]\n(0,0) [after '-']\n(0,0) [after '1']\n\nThen the points are:\n(0,0) repeated.\n\nThen the program checks: \nfor i=0 to k-3 (k=3) -> i only 0? \ni=0: j from 3 to 2 (so no j) -> then no collision? Then it would output \"OK\".\n\nBut is that the expected behavior? We are running the second program on a string that was not intended.\n\nGiven the original problems are independent, this is artificial.\n\nBut the problem says to do it.\n\nSo I will implement accordingly.\n\nSteps in C:\n\n1. Read an integer K (using scanf).\n2. Compute n = solve(K) [the logic from the first program].\n3. Convert n to a string (using sprintf). We have to handle negative numbers.\n4. Run the second program's logic on that string.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses a grid and checks for collisions between non-consecutive points that are adjacent (with a step of at most 1 in one coordinate and 0 in the other). It records every step (including the start).\n\nWe must translate both programs.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC174_C) in C:\n\n    int solve(int K) {\n        if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) \n            return -1;\n        if (K % 7 == 0) \n            K /= 7;\n        K *= 9;\n        int ans = 1;\n        int remainder = 10 % K;\n        while (remainder != 1) {\n            ans++;\n            remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\nBut note: what if K becomes 0? The modulo operation by zero is undefined. In the original, if K is 0 after modifications, we would have a division by zero? But the condition at the beginning: if K is even or divisible by 5, return -1. Also, if K is divisible by 7, we divide by 7. But note: K is at least 1? The input K is at least 1? The problem says K>=1.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nSecond program (codeforces_8_B) in C:\n\nWe have a string s (which is the string representation of the integer n).\n\nWe simulate the moves:\n\n    x = 0, y = 0;\n    int path_length = 0;\n    We need to store the coordinates at each step (including start).\n\n    We'll use arrays for x and y coordinates. The maximum length is the length of the string plus one (for the start). The string length of an integer: the integer n can be at most ... the original K up to 10^6? The answer n can be up to K (which is up to 10^6) so the string might be 7 characters? But we don't know. We should allocate dynamically? or use a fixed buffer.\n\nBut note: the first program's answer n can be large (up to K, and K up to 1000000) so the string representation of n has at most 7 digits? Actually, the worst-case n is about 9*K, so for K=1000000, n=9000000 -> 7 digits.\n\nBut we can use a fixed buffer of 20 characters.\n\nSteps for second program:\n\n    char s[20]; // we will get this from the integer n\n    int co[2][101]; // but the original Java used 101, but our string length is at most 20? so the path will have 21 points.\n\n    Actually, the second program in Java allocated:\n        char[] ch = new char[100];   // for the string, which is up to 100 characters?\n        int[][] co = new int[2][101]; // 101 points? because the string length is up to 100 -> 101 points.\n\n    But our string is short (<=20) so we can use a fixed array of 21 points.\n\n    However, the original code in Java used:\n        for (i = 0; i < k - 3; ++i) {\n            for (j = i + 3; j < k; ++j) {\n\n    k is the number of points (string length + 1).\n\n    Since k is at most 21, we can do nested loops.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        int x = 0, y = 0;\n        int k = 0;\n        int co[0][0] = x; co[1][0] = y; k=1;\n\n        for each character in the string:\n            if char is 'L': x--\n            if 'R': x++\n            if 'U': y++\n            if 'D': y--\n            and record (x,y) at step k, then k++\n\n        Then, for i from 0 to k-3 (inclusive) and j from i+3 to k-1, check the Manhattan distance? Actually, the code checks:\n\n            dx = |co[0][i] - co[0][j]|\n            dy = |co[1][i] - co[1][j]|\n            if (dx<=1 && dy==0) -> adjacent horizontally\n            or (dy<=1 && dx==0) -> adjacent vertically\n\n        If such a pair is found, then flag = false.\n\n        Then output \"OK\" if flag is true, else \"BUG\".\n\nBut note: the original condition: \n        if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0))\n\n    Actually, if dx==0 and dy==0, that would also trigger? But that's when the points are the same -> adjacent? Actually, same point is adjacent? But the problem in codeforces is about the path not having self-intersections and not having shortcuts. The original problem says: if there is a point that is revisited or if there is a point that is adjacent to a non-consecutive point then it's a bug.\n\n    But consecutive points are not checked because j starts at i+3. So if two consecutive points are adjacent (which they are) we skip.\n\n    However, if the same point appears again (repeated) then dx=0, dy=0 -> then (dx<=1 and dy==0) -> true. So it will be detected.\n\n    So our translation is correct.\n\nBut note: the condition in the Java program is:\n\n        if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0))\n\n    This is equivalent to: the two points are adjacent horizontally or vertically (including same point: which is adjacent with dx=0,dy=0).\n\n    Actually, same point: dx=0,dy=0 -> (0<=1 and 0==0) -> true.\n\n    So if a point repeats, it will be caught.\n\nNow, we write the C program.\n\nSteps:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdbool.h>\n\n    // Function for the first program\n    int solve(int K) {\n        if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0)\n            return -1;\n        if (K % 7 == 0)\n            K /= 7;\n        K *= 9;\n        int ans = 1;\n        int remainder = 10 % K;\n        while (remainder != 1) {\n            ans++;\n            remainder = (remainder * 10) % K;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n        int K;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n        // First program\n        int n = solve(K);\n\n        // Convert n to string\n        char s[20];\n        sprintf(s, \"%d\", n);\n\n        // Now run the second program on the string s\n        int x = 0, y = 0;\n        int k = 0;\n        // We'll store the coordinates: we have at most strlen(s)+1 points\n        int len = strlen(s);\n        int co[2][101]; // 101 is safe because len<=7 -> 8 points\n\n        // Start at (0,0)\n        co[0][k] = x;\n        co[1][k] = y;\n        k++;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\n            switch (s[i]) {\n                case 'L': \n                    x--;\n                    break;\n                case 'R':\n                    x++;\n                    break;\n                case 'U':\n                    y++;\n                    break;\n                case 'D':\n                    y--;\n                    break;\n                // If the character is not one of these, we do nothing (like the Java program)\n                default:\n                    break;\n            }\n            co[0][k] = x;\n            co[1][k] = y;\n            k++;\n        }\n\n        bool flag = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i < k - 3; ++i) {\n            for (int j = i + 3; j < k; ++j) {\n                int dx = co[0][i] - co[0][j];\n                int dy = co[1][i] - co[1][j];\n                if (dx < 0) dx = -dx;\n                if (dy < 0) dy = -dy;\n                if ((dx <= 1 && dy == 0) || (dy <= 1 && dx == 0)) {\n                    flag = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (!flag) break;\n        }\n\n        if (flag) \n            printf(\"OK\\n\");\n        else \n            printf(\"BUG\\n\");\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nBut note: the Java program for the second problem used 100 as the maximum string length. We are using a fixed buffer for the string (20) and the coordinate array (101) which is safe.\n\nHowever, what if n is a negative number? Then the string will start with '-'. We handle that in the switch: it will be ignored (so no move).\n\nBut the coordinate recording will still happen.\n\nAlso, the condition for the first program: if K is divisible by 2 or 5, it returns -1. Then the string is \"-1\", which has length 2. Then the path will be:\n\n    (0,0) -> no move for '-' -> (0,0) -> no move for '1' -> (0,0)\n\nSo we have three points: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0). Then k=3.\n\n    Loop for i: from 0 to k-3 (i=0 to 0) and j from i+3=3 to k-1 (which is 2) -> no j. So flag remains true -> output \"OK\".\n\nBut if the first program returns a positive integer, say 2, then the string is \"2\", which is one character. Then the path:\n\n    (0,0) -> then for '2': not a move -> (0,0). So two points: (0,0) and (0,0). Then k=2.\n\n    The loop: i from 0 to k-3 = 2-3 = -1 -> loop doesn't run -> flag true -> \"OK\".\n\nBut what if the first program returns 4? Then the string is \"4\", which is not a move -> same as above.\n\nBut what if the string representation contains a digit that is not a move? We do nothing.\n\nBut what if the string representation by chance contains one of the letters? For example, if we had used base 18 and got a letter? But we are using base 10. So the digits are '0' to '9'. None of these are in the move set.\n\nSo every character in the string will be ignored. Therefore, the path will be a sequence of (0,0) repeated. Then the only adjacent points are consecutive? but we skip consecutive points (j>=i+3). So if there are at least 4 points (which happens if the string length>=3) then we will have repeated points. For example, if n=100, then the string is \"100\", which has 3 characters. Then we have 4 points: (0,0) four times. Then:\n\n    i=0, j=3: distance between (0,0) and (0,0) is (0,0) -> adjacent -> flag becomes false.\n\nSo for n=100, the output would be \"BUG\".\n\nBut note: the first program: for K=1, what is n?\n\n    K=1: \n        not divisible by 2 or 5 -> continue.\n        divisible by 7? 1%7 !=0 -> skip.\n        then K *=9 -> 9.\n        remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so ans=1.\n\n    So n=1 -> string \"1\", which has 1 character -> 2 points: (0,0) and (0,0). Then k=2 -> no loop -> \"OK\".\n\nFor K=3: \n    not div by 2 or 5.\n    not div by 7.\n    K=27.\n    remainder = 10 % 27 = 10.\n    then: 10*10 %27 = 100%27=100-3*27=100-81=19.\n    then: 19*10 %27=190%27=190-7*27=190-189=1 -> so ans=3.\n\n    n=3 -> string \"3\" -> two points: (0,0) and (0,0). Then k=2 -> no loop -> \"OK\".\n\nFor K=7:\n    divisible by 7 -> K/=7 -> becomes 1, then *9 -> 9 -> same as K=1 -> n=1 -> \"1\" -> \"OK\".\n\nFor K=49: \n    divisible by 7 -> becomes 7 -> then we do the same as K=7: becomes 1 -> n=1 -> \"1\" -> \"OK\".\n\nFor K=2: returns -1 -> then string \"-1\" -> 3 points: (0,0) three times -> then i=0, j=3? but k=3 -> j from 3 to 2 (so no j) -> \"OK\".\n\nBut for K= some value that leads to n=100? We saw that leads to \"BUG\".\n\nBut what K leads to n=100? \n\n    We need: \n        K = ... \n        n = 100.\n\n    The recurrence: \n        remainder_0 = 10 % (9*K_adj)  [with K_adj = K or K/7 if divisible by 7]\n        remainder_1 = (10*remainder_0) % (9*K_adj)\n        ... \n        remainder_99 = (10*remainder_98) % (9*K_adj) = 1.\n\n    We need to find a K such that the multiplicative order of 10 modulo (9*K_adj) is 100.\n\n    For example, K_adj = (10^100-1)/9. But that is huge. But note: the original K is up to 10^6.\n\n    So n (the answer) is at most about 9*K, which is 9e6. But 9e6 is 7 digits. So the string length is at most 7. Therefore, we cannot get a string of 100 digits. The maximum string length is 7.\n\n    Therefore, the maximum k (number of points) is 8.\n\n    Then the loop: \n        i from 0 to 8-3=5\n        j from i+3 to 7\n\n    We can have at most 8 points. The only way to get a collision is if the same point appears at least 4 times? Actually, if the same point appears at indices i and j with j>=i+3, then we have a collision.\n\n    How can we get the same point? The moves are ignored, so we always stay at (0,0). So every step is (0,0). Then we have 8 points of (0,0). Then:\n\n        i=0, j=3: (0,0) and (0,0) -> dx=0,dy=0 -> condition true -> flag=false -> \"BUG\".\n\n    So for any n that has a string representation of length>=3, we will have at least 4 points (including the start) and then the first point and the fourth point are both (0,0) -> collision.\n\n    Therefore, the output for any n that is negative (like -1) has length 2 -> 3 points -> no collision? \n        points: [ (0,0), (0,0), (0,0) ] -> k=3.\n        i goes from 0 to 0 (since k-3=0) -> i=0, j from 3 to 2 -> no j -> no collision.\n\n    For n>=100: the string length is 3 -> 4 points -> then i=0, j=3: (0,0) and (0,0) -> collision -> \"BUG\".\n\n    For n>=1000: 4 digits -> 5 points -> i=0, j=3: (0,0) and (0,0) -> collision.\n\n    For n>=10: 2 digits -> 3 points -> no collision? \n        But wait: 10 has two digits -> k=3 points -> i from 0 to 0, j from 3 to 2 -> no j -> no collision.\n\n    For n>=100000: 6 digits -> 7 points -> then i=0, j=3: collision -> \"BUG\".\n\n    But note: the first program never returns 100? It returns the length of the repunit. The minimal repunit divisible by K. The repunit length is at least 1. The smallest repunit is 1, then 11, then 111, etc.\n\n    The value of n is the length. For K=1, n=1. For K=3, n=3. For K=7, n=6? Actually, for K=7: \n        We do: if divisible by 7 -> K=1 -> then n=1? But wait:\n\n        The original code: \n            if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n            K *= 9;\n\n        For K=7: \n            K becomes 1, then 9.\n            Then we compute: \n                remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so n=1.\n\n        But actually, the repunit divisible by 7: \n            111111 (6 ones) is divisible by 7 -> so the answer should be 6.\n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        The original problem: \n            We want the smallest n such that R_n = (10^n-1)/9 is divisible by K.\n\n        The code does: \n            if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;   // because 10 and K are not coprime? \n            Then if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n            Then K *= 9;\n\n        Then we are looking for the smallest n such that 10^n \u2261 1 (mod K'=9*K_adj)\n\n        Why? \n\n        Note: \n            R_n * 9 = 10^n - 1.\n\n        So we want 10^n \u2261 1 (mod 9*K_adj) [where K_adj = K if K not divisible by 7, or K/7 if divisible by 7?]\n\n        Actually, the problem says: if K is divisible by 7, then we can remove the factor of 7? Why?\n\n        Because the problem states: \n            \"It is known that if K and 10 are coprime, then there exists a repunit divisible by K. But if K is divisible by 2 or 5, then there is no solution. Also, note that if K is divisible by 7, then we can reduce it by dividing by 7 and then multiply by 9 to form the modulus.\"\n\n        Actually, the known approach: \n            We want 10^n \u2261 1 (mod 9*K / gcd(9*K, 10^\u221e))? \n\n        But the code is standard. Let me check an example: \n            K=7: \n                The code: \n                    K % 7==0 -> K=1\n                    then K=9\n                then we compute the multiplicative order of 10 mod 9 -> which is 1 (since 10 mod 9=1) -> so n=1.\n\n            But the smallest repunit divisible by 7 is 111111 (n=6). \n\n        This indicates the code is flawed? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for ABC174_C:\n\n            long ans = 1;\n            long r = 1;\n            while (r % K != 0) {\n                r = (r * 10 + 1) % K;\n                ans++;\n            }\n\n        But that is too slow for K=10^6? \n\n        The solution we have is: \n            if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n            K = K / gcd(K, 9);   // because R_n * 9 = 10^n-1, so we require 9*K | 10^n-1? \n            Then we want the order of 10 modulo K (if K is coprime with 10) but then multiplied by 9?\n\n        Actually, the known solution: \n            if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n            long x = 1;\n            int res = 0;\n            do {\n                res++;\n                x = (x * 10) % K;\n            } while (x!=1);\n\n        But that is for the modulus being K? \n\n        The standard solution for ABC174_C:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            int main() {\n                int k;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                int a = 0;\n                for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n                    a = (a * 10 + 7) % k;\n                    if (a == 0) {\n                        printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n                        return 0;\n                    }\n                }\n                printf(\"-1\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But that is for 7, not for 1.\n\n        After checking the sample: \n            Input: 7 -> output: 6.\n\n        Our code for K=7: \n            if (K%2==0 || K%5==0) -> no.\n            if (K%7==0) -> yes -> K=1.\n            then K=9.\n            remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so we break the loop and return 1.\n\n        This is wrong.\n\n        The correct approach: \n            We are to find the smallest n such that (10^n-1)/9 is divisible by K.\n\n            => 10^n \u2261 1 (mod 9K)   [if 9K and 10 are coprime?]\n\n            But note: if K has factors 2 or 5, then 9K is not coprime with 10 -> no solution.\n\n            The known solution: \n                Let M = 9*K.\n                Then we require 10^n \u2261 1 (mod M/gcd(M,10^\u221e))? \n\n            Actually, we can set M = 9*K, and then if gcd(M,10) != 1, then we cannot have 10^n \u2261 1 mod M? But wait, we removed 2 and 5 from K? \n\n            The code condition: \n                if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n\n            Then we remove the factor of 7? Why 7? \n\n        Looking at the sample: \n            K=7: \n                The standard solution (from known) is 6.\n\n            The known solution in the code we are given: \n                if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n                then M = 9*K.\n\n            For K=7: M=9.\n\n            Then we want the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9: \n                10^1 mod 9 = 1 -> so order=1.\n\n            But then the repunit: \n                R_1 = 1 -> 1 is divisible by 7? No.\n\n        So the given Java program is flawed for K=7.\n\n        How did the original atcoder_ABC174_C pass? \n\n        I checked the sample: \n            Input: 7 -> Output: 6.\n\n        The code I see in the sample above is not the standard one.\n\n        Actually, the code from atcoder_ABC174_C that is known to be accepted:\n\n            import java.util.*;\n            public class Main {\n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    int k = sc.nextInt();\n                    if (k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 == 0) {\n                        System.out.println(-1);\n                        return;\n                    }\n                    int x = 1;\n                    int ans = 1;\n                    while (x % k != 0) {\n                        x %= k;\n                        x = x * 10 + 1;\n                        ans++;\n                    }\n                    System.out.println(ans);\n                }\n            }\n\n        But the provided code in the problem is different.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            private static int solve() throws IOException {\n                int K = readInt();\n                if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n                if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n                K *= 9;\n                int ans = 1;\n                int remainder = 10 % K;\n                while (remainder != 1) {\n                    ans++;\n                    remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n                }\n                return ans;\n            }\n\n        This is an alternative solution. \n\n        Why does it work for K=1,3 but not for K=7?\n\n        Let me compute for K=7:\n\n            K=7 -> divisible by 7 -> K becomes 1.\n            Then K=9.\n            remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so it returns 1.\n\n        But the expected answer is 6.\n\n        Therefore, the provided Java program for the first problem is incorrect.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\", so we must translate the given code.\n\n        So even though it is flawed, we will use it.\n\n        For K=7, it returns 1.\n\n        Then we convert 1 to the string \"1\", which has one character -> two points: (0,0) and (0,0) -> then no collision -> output \"OK\".\n\n        In the original first program, the output for K=7 is 1, and then the second program outputs \"OK\".\n\n        But the expected output of the first program should be 6 for K=7? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\", so we are reproducing the behavior of the given Java programs.\n\n        Therefore, we are not to correct them.\n\n        So we proceed.\n\n        Summary: the C program will be as above.\n\n        One more thing: the second program in Java uses a fixed array of 101 for the coordinates. But our string length is at most 20, so we are safe.\n\n        Let me test with K=7: \n            n = 1 -> string \"1\" -> two points: (0,0) and (0,0). \n            Then we do:\n                k=2.\n                i from 0 to 2-3 = -1 -> loop not entered -> flag=true -> \"OK\".\n\n        For K=3: \n            n=3 -> string \"3\" -> two points: (0,0) and (0,0) -> \"OK\".\n\n        For K=2: \n            n=-1 -> string \"-1\" -> three points: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0) -> then i=0 to 0, j from 3 to 2 (none) -> \"OK\".\n\n        For K= some value that returns n=100 (even though we said it's not possible within the constraints, but if it did) then we would have a string \"100\" -> four points: (0,0) four times -> i=0, j=3: (0,0) and (0,0) -> dx=0,dy=0 -> true -> \"BUG\".\n\n        But note: n is at most about 9e6, so the string representation has at most 7 or 8 characters. The smallest n that is 100 is 100, which is 3 digits -> then we would get \"BUG\".\n\n        But in reality, the first program will not return 100 for any K in the range [1,1000000]? We don't know.\n\n        We are simply translating.\n\n        Code:\n\n        We'll write the C program as described.\n\n        Note: the second program in the provided Java code uses an array of size 101 for the coordinates. We are using a fixed size of 101, which is safe since our string is short.\n\n        However, we must ensure we don't exceed 101 points: k = len(s)+1 <= 20+1 = 21.\n\n        We are safe.\n\n        Final code:"
