For example, a string without 'S' would have s_pos =-1. So the diff is (-1) - g_pos. If g_pos is >=0, then diff is (-1 - g_pos), which is <=-1 -0 =-1, which is negative. So invalid is set to 1.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does.\n\nThe Python code reads two integers, n and m. Then, for each of the n lines, it reads a string. For each string, it calculates the position of 'S' minus the position of 'G'. These values are stored in a set c. Finally, it checks if any of these differences are negative. If so, it outputs -1; otherwise, it outputs the size of the set c.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: processing each line to find the positions of 'S' and 'G', compute their difference, collect unique differences, check if any are negative, then output the count or -1.\n\nNow, translating this into C. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading n and m. In C, we can use scanf to read integers. Then, for each of n lines, we need to read a string (of length m, I suppose). For each string, find the indices of 'S' and 'G'.\n\nWait, in Python, the string's find method returns the first occurrence. So in each string, s.find(\"S\") gives the index of 'S', and s.find(\"G\") gives the index of 'G'. Then subtract these. But if either is not found, find returns -1. But in the problem's context, each string must have exactly one 'S' and one 'G', right? Otherwise, the subtraction could be negative if 'S' is after 'G' (since s.find(\"S\") would be higher than s.find(\"G\"), but wait no. If 'S' comes after 'G', then s.find(\"S\") is a higher index than s.find(\"G\"), so their difference is positive. Wait, wait, in the code it's s.find(\"S\") minus s.find(\"G\"). So if 'S' is after 'G', the difference is positive. If 'S' is before 'G', then the difference is negative. Wait, no, wait: for example, if the string is \"GS\", then s.find(\"G\") is 0, s.find(\"S\") is 1. So 1-0=1. If the string is \"SG\", then s.find(\"S\") is 0, s.find(\"G\") is 1, so 0-1=-1. So the difference is negative when 'S' comes before 'G' in the string. But in that case, the distance between 'G' and 'S' would be positive (since the positions are indexes). So the code's logic is to compute the offset needed to go from G to S. But if S is before G, then the difference is negative, which is invalid. Hence, the code checks if any of the differences are negative (if any a <0 in c) and outputs -1 in that case. Otherwise, the number of unique differences is the answer.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. For each of n lines, read the string.\n\n3. For each string, find the positions of 'S' and 'G'.\n\n4. Compute the difference (s_pos - g_pos).\n\n5. Check if any difference is negative. If so, output -1.\n\n6. Otherwise, collect all unique differences and count them.\n\nNow, in C, handling strings and sets is a bit more manual. Since we need to collect unique values, we can use an array to store the differences, and check for duplicates as we add them.\n\nFirst, let's handle reading the input. For each string, loop through the characters to find 'S' and 'G'. Let's track their positions. For a given string, iterate each character until found.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple 'S' or 'G' in the string? The Python code uses find, which gets the first occurrence. So in C, for each string, we need to scan from the start and find the first occurrence of 'S' and 'G'.\n\nOnce we have s_pos and g_pos for the string, compute diff = s_pos - g_pos. Wait, wait! Wait in the Python code, it's s.find(\"S\") - s.find(\"G\"). So for each string, the code computes the position of S minus the position of G. So if S is after G, the difference is positive. If S is before G, the difference is negative. So the code checks if any of these differences are negative. But according to the problem statement, maybe the requirement is that S must come after G in each string. Because if any string has S before G, then the difference is negative, and the answer is -1. Otherwise, the answer is the number of unique differences (each difference is the number of steps to move from G to S, perhaps indicating the required step size in a grid, and the number of unique steps needed, hence the answer is the count of unique steps).\n\nSo, in C, we need to:\n\n- For each string, find the first 'G' and first 'S'. Then compute their difference.\n\nBut first, let's process each string.\n\nSo for each of the n strings:\n\nLoop through the characters until we find 'G' and 'S'. Record their positions.\n\nCompute diff = s_pos - g_pos.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Python code's line is c = set(s.find(\"S\") - s.find(\"G\") ... ). So the code is taking the position of S minus the position of G. So if S is at position 3, G at position 1, then 3-1=2. But if S is at position 1 and G at 3, then 1-3 = -2, which is negative. So in that case, the code adds a negative to the set, and then the code checks if any a in c is <0, which in this case, the set would have -2. So the code outputs -1.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nFor each string:\n\nfind the first occurrence of 'G' (g_pos) and 'S' (s_pos).\n\nCompute diff = s_pos - g_pos.\n\nIf this diff is negative, then we need to output -1.\n\nWait no. The code checks if any of the differences in the set c are negative. So even if one string's diff is negative, output -1.\n\nSo in C, perhaps we can process each string, compute the diff, and immediately check if it is negative. If any diff is negative, set a flag and break, then output -1.\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, the set c is built with all the diffs, then it checks if any in the set are negative. But in reality, if any string's diff is negative, then the set will contain that negative value, and thus the any() check will be true. So the code is equivalent to checking if any of the strings have s before g (i.e., diff is negative). So perhaps in C, during the processing of each string, we can check the diff and if it's negative, set a flag and break early. Then, after processing all strings, if the flag is set, output -1. Otherwise, collect all unique diffs and output the count.\n\nThat's more efficient. Because in the Python code, even if all diffs are positive, but there's one negative in the set, it outputs -1. But in practice, if a string has a negative diff, it would be added to the set, and the any() check would detect it. So in C, during processing each string, we can compute the diff, check if it's negative. If yes, then immediately we can mark the answer as -1. Otherwise, collect the diff in a data structure that keeps unique values.\n\nThis approach would save memory and time, as we don't need to collect all diffs first, then check. Instead, during processing, if any string has a negative diff, we can immediately know that the answer is -1.\n\nSo the steps in C would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nInitialize a flag, say, invalid = 0.\n\nInitialize a dynamic array or a static array (if n is small) to store unique diffs. Alternatively, use a hash set, but in C, that's not straightforward. So for simplicity, let's use an array and track the current size.\n\nBut since n can be up to 500 (assuming the constraints are similar to typical programming problems), but the code in the original Python uses a set. So the maximum possible number of unique diffs is up to n. But in practice, for each string, compute the diff, and if it's not already in the array, add it.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Initialize an array to store unique diffs. Let's say we have an array 'diffs' of size n, since each unique diff can't exceed n entries. Also, a variable 'count' to track the number of unique entries.\n\n3. Initialize invalid = 0.\n\n4. For each of n strings:\n\n   a. Read the string.\n\n   b. Find positions of 'G' and 'S' in the string.\n\n   c. Compute diff = s_pos - g_pos.\n\n   d. If diff < 0, set invalid = 1.\n\n   e. Else, check if this diff is already in the diffs array. If not, add it.\n\n5. After processing all strings, if invalid is 1, output -1.\n\n6. Else, output the count of unique diffs.\n\nBut how to read the strings? Let's think: each string is of length m. So for each string, we can read a char array of size m+1 (for null terminator). Then, for each string, loop through each character to find 'G' and 'S'.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nint n, m;\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n// arrays to track unique diffs\n\nint diffs[n]; // maximum possible size is n\n\nint count = 0;\n\nint invalid = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    char s[m+1];\n\n    scanf(\"%s\", s);\n\n    int g_pos = -1, s_pos = -1;\n\n    // find first 'G' and 'S' in s\n\n    for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n\n        if (s[j] == 'G') {\n\n            if (g_pos == -1) {\n\n                g_pos = j;\n\n            }\n\n        } else if (s[j] == 'S') {\n\n            if (s_pos == -1) {\n\n                s_pos = j;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // once both found, can break early\n\n        if (g_pos != -1 && s_pos != -1) {\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check if both found\n\n    if (g_pos == -1 || s_pos == -1) {\n\n        // invalid case, but according to the problem's input constraints, maybe this can't happen?\n\n        // but the original Python code would have s.find(\"S\") - s.find(\"G\"), which if either is not found, returns -1 - (-1) = 0? Or if one is found but not the other?\n\n        // in the original code, the input must be such that each string has exactly one 'S' and one 'G'? Otherwise, the code could have a problem.\n\n        // but according to the problem's input constraints, perhaps each string has exactly one 'S' and one 'G'.\n\n        // So in C, if during processing a string, either 'G' or 'S' is not found, then it's invalid. But the problem may not specify this. However, the original Python code uses find, which returns -1 if not found. So for example, if a string has no 'S', then s.find(\"S\") is -1. So the diff is (-1) - g_pos. Which would be a negative number if g_pos is >=0. So the code would output -1.\n\n        // So in C, in the code, after finding g_pos and s_pos, compute diff.\n\n        // So even if one is not found, we can proceed. For example, if a string has no 'S', then s_pos is -1. Then diff is (-1 - g_pos). If g_pos is found (>=0), then diff is negative. So the code would detect that and output -1.\n\n        // So in C, even if some strings have missing 'S' or 'G', the code would handle it.\n\n    }\n\n    int diff = s_pos - g_pos;\n\n    if (diff < 0) {\n\n        invalid = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // check if this diff is already in the diffs array\n\n        int found = 0;\n\n        for (int k=0; k < count; k++) {\n\n            if (diffs[k] == diff) {\n\n                found = 1;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (!found) {\n\n            diffs[count++] = diff;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (invalid) {\n\n    printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the variable 'invalid' is set to 1 if any diff is negative. Then, even if other diffs are positive, we output -1. Which matches the Python code's logic.\n\nBut what if a string has s_pos - g_pos negative, but another string has a positive diff? Then the 'invalid' is set to 1, and we output -1. Which is correct.\n\nBut also, the code for finding 'G' and 'S' may have some issues. For example, in a string where 'G' appears after 'S', but during the loop, we find 'S' first. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"S...G\". Then, the loop processes each character:\n\n- when j=0, s[j] is 'S', so s_pos is set to 0.\n\n- then j increments until 'G' is found. So g_pos is set to, say, 3.\n\nThen diff = 0 -3 = -3, which is negative. So 'invalid' is set to 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems okay.\n\nNow, handling the case where a string has no 'S' or 'G'. For example, a string without 'S' would have s_pos =-1. So the diff is (-1) - g_pos. If g_pos is >=0, then diff is (-1 - g_pos), which is <=-1 -0 =-1, which is negative. So invalid is set to 1.\n\nIf a string has no 'G', then g_pos is -1. So diff is s_pos - (-1) = s_pos +1. But if s_pos is -1 (no 'S' either), then diff is (-1) - (-1) =0. But then, in that case, s_pos is -1 and g_pos is -1. So diff is 0. But according to the problem's logic, this would be allowed. But perhaps the problem's input ensures that each string has exactly one 'S' and one 'G'. But the code handles even these edge cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nSample input:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=5.\n\nStrings:\n\nG..S (positions G at 0, S at 3 \u2192 diff 3-0=3)\n\nGS... (G at 0, S at 1 \u2192 1-0=1)\n\nS....G (S at 0, G at5 \u2192 diff 0-5= -5 \u2192 invalid)\n\nThen the code would set invalid=1, output -1.\n\nAnother sample where all diffs are positive:\n\nn=2, m=3.\n\nStrings:\n\nG S \u2192 positions 0 and 1 \u2192 diff 1.\n\nG..S \u2192 diff 2.\n\nSo the set has {1,2} \u2192 count is 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nIn C code, the code would collect these diffs in the array, count=2, output 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible optimizations:\n\nThe code uses an array to track unique diffs, and for each new diff, loops through the array to check for duplicates. For small n (like up to 1e3), this is acceptable. But for larger n, this would be O(n^2), which could be slow. However, given the problem's possible constraints, this approach is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible diff can be up to m-1 (since m is the length of the string), but the code's original Python uses a set, which is the same approach as using an array here.\n\nTherefore, the code should work correctly.\n\nSo the translated C code should look like this."
