If so, X is V[i], Y is C[i], and then appends X-Y to the list. Finally, it sums the list and prints the sum.\n\nWait, but in the loop, they are checking if V[i] - C[i] is positive. Then they set X and Y, but then append X-Y, which is the same as V[i]-C[i]. So the loop is just adding all the positive (V[i] - C[i]) values to the list. Oh, right, and the list starts with 0. So when you sum it, if none of the elements are positive, the sum is 0. But the initial 0 is included. Wait, but in the code, the list starts with 0, but then in the loop, when a positive value is found, they append X-Y. So the sum would be 0 plus all the positive differences.

But maybe the original code intended to sum all the positive (V-C) values. Because the initial 0 would be added, but if any positive values are present, they are added. Wait, for example, if all elements are positive, then list is [0, a, b, c], sum is 0+a+b+c. But that's not the same as the sum of all a, b, c. So why is there a 0 in the list?\n\nWait, looking at the Python code again. The list is initialized with [0]. Then, for each i, if V[i]-C[i] >0, append that difference. Then sum the list. So the sum is 0 plus the sum of all positive differences. But that's equivalent to the sum of all positive differences. Because 0 + sum(...) is just sum(...). So why include the 0 in the list?

Then since 5-3=2>0, append 2. So list is [0,2]. Sum is 2. Which is correct. If V[0] is 2, C[0] is 5, then V-C is -3, so no append. Sum is 0. Correct. So the 0 is redundant but included. But in the code, when there are positive values, the 0 is added to the sum. Wait, no: sum of [0, a, b, c] is 0+a+b+c, which is same as a+b+c. So the 0 is unnecessary. The original code's logic is adding 0 to the sum. But why? Maybe a mistake in the original code. But since I have to translate it as is, I have to include that 0.

So the sum is sum(0 + sum of all positive terms). Which is same as sum of all positive terms. So perhaps the 0 is redundant, but the code includes it. So in the C translation, should I include that 0?\n\nHmm. Let me see. For example, if all the V[i]-C[i] are negative, the list would be [0], sum is 0. If there are some positive terms, the sum is 0 plus those terms. So the 0 is part of the sum. But in that case, the code's output is the sum of all positive (V-C) terms.

But the correct approach is to sum all the positive terms.\n\nTherefore, in C, the code can be written as:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead V and C arrays.\n\nCompute sum as 0.\n\nFor each i, if V[i] - C[i] >0, add to sum.\n\nPrint sum.\n\nThat would be equivalent. Because sum(list) in Python is sum of 0 plus all the positive terms. But sum of 0 plus those terms is the same as sum of the terms. Because 0 + a + b is a + b.\n\nWait, no. If the list is [0], then sum is 0. If the list is [0, 2], sum is 2. Which is the same as if the list was [2]. So the initial 0 in the list doesn't affect the sum. So the code's logic is equivalent to summing all the positive terms. So the initial 0 is unnecessary. So the Python code can be rewritten as sum( [V[i]-C[i] for i in range(N) if V[i]-C[i]>0] ), and then sum that. So the original code's list with [0] is a mistake, but the actual result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the C code can just sum the positive terms.\n\nSo the steps for the C code are:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read the next line, split into N integers for V.\n\n- Read the next line, split into N integers for C.\n\n- Initialize sum to 0.\n\n- For each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   if (V[i] - C[i]) >0, sum += V[i] - C[i]\n\n- Print sum.\n\nSo that's the approach. Now, in C, how to read the input?\n\nIn C, we need to read N, then read two lines of N numbers each.\n\nSo first, read N as an integer.\n\nThen read V array: perhaps using scanf in a loop, reading N numbers.\n\nSimilarly for C array.\n\nBut in Python, input().split() splits on any whitespace, which may include spaces and newlines. So in C, when reading the numbers, we can read all numbers until we have read N for each array.\n\nSo code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    int V[N], C[N];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &C[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int sum = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        int diff = V[i] - C[i];\n\n        if (diff > 0) {\n\n            sum += diff;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the original Python code initializes the list with 0. But in the code above, sum starts at 0, which is equivalent. Because when you add all the positive differences, the sum is correct. So the initial 0 in the list in the Python code is redundant. So this C code is correct.\n\nSo the answer is to write this code.\n\nBut let's check the original Python code again. For example, if N=0 (but the code starts with N = int(input()), so N can't be zero as per input?), but assuming N is at least 1. But in C, V[N] and C[N] with N=0 would be invalid. But the original code may assume N is a positive integer.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code is supposed to translate correctly. So the C code as above should be correct."
