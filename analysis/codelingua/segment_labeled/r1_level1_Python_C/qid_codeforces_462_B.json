So in C, after reading s, we can loop until the null terminator, but in case of incorrect input, but assuming the problem's input is correct.\n\nNow, the rest is straightforward.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nInclude necessary headers: stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h.\n\nThe comparison function for qsort.\n\nSo the C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    int num1 = *(const int *)a;\n    int num2 = *(const int *)b;\n    return num2 - num1; // descending order\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n    char s[100001];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s);\n    \n    int count[26] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = s[i];\n        count[c - 'A']++;\n    }\n    \n    qsort(count, 26, sizeof(int), compare);\n    \n    long long res = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n        if (count[i] >= k) {\n            res += (long long)k * k;\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", res);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        k -= count[i];\n        res += (long long)count[i] * count[i];\n    }\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", res);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, after adding k*k and printing, it exits. So in C, after that, return 0. The same in the loop.\n\nWhat if after processing all 26 elements, the loop ends and then prints res. So the code after the loop is necessary.\n\nPotential edge cases: when k is zero (but the problem statement probably has k >=1?), but the code should handle it as per the logic.\n\nTesting:\n\nSample input:\n\nLet's take the sample from the code.\n\nFor example, if s is \"ABCA\", counts would be A:2, B:1, C:1, others 0. Sorted in reverse: 2,1,1,0,... Then k is 3.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ni=0: count[i]=2. k is 3. 2 <3, so subtract 2 from k (k becomes 1), add 2^2=4 to res.\n\ni=1: count[i] is 1. 1 >= remaining k (1). So add 1^2=1 to res (total 5). print and exit.\n\nSo output is 5.\n\nAnother test case: suppose k is 5, counts are [5,3,2]. Then first iteration, 5 >=5: add 25, done.\n\nAnother test case: counts are [3,3,3], k=7. First, 3 >=7? No. subtract 3, res +=9. k=4. Next, 3 >=4? No. subtract 3, res +=9. k=1. Next, 3 >=1: yes. add 1*1=1. total 9+9+1=19.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nNow, in C code, the variables are correctly handled.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- The qsort is correctly sorting in descending order. The compare function is correct.\n\n- The loop through the string correctly increments the counts.\n\n- Handling the k correctly as it's modified.\n\nSo the code should work."
