So that's the same as the Python code.\n\nThus, the logic is preserved.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nPotential code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s[1001];\n    scanf(\"%1000s\", s);\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        char x[3];\n        scanf(\"%2s\", x);\n        int a = 0, b = 0;\n        for (char *j = s; *j != '\\0'; j++) {\n            if (*j == x[0]) {\n                a++;\n            } else if (*j == x[1]) {\n                b++;\n            } else {\n                ans += a < b ? a : b;\n                a = 0;\n                b = 0;\n            }\n        }\n        ans += a < b ? a : b;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the C code, after reading x, the code may have leading whitespace. For example, after reading n with scanf(\"%d\", &n), the next input is x. But the %d leaves a newline in the input buffer. Then, the next scanf(\"%2s\", x) will skip any whitespace (including newlines) and read the next two non-whitespace characters. So that's correct.\n\nTesting this code against the Python code:\n\nSample input:\n\nLet's say s is \"abracadabra\", n is 2. Then first x is \"ab\", next x is \"ra\".\n\nProcessing first x:\n\nIn s, the characters are a, b, r, a, c, a, d, a, b, r, a.\n\nFor x[0] = 'a', x[1] = 'b'.\n\nLoop through each character:\n\na: a increments a to 1.\n\nb: matches x[1], so b increments to 1.\n\nr: not a or b. Add min(1,1)=1 to ans. ans becomes 1. Reset a and b.\n\nr is processed, then a (x[0] again), etc.\n\nWait, maybe the example is getting too complicated. But the code seems to handle it as per the logic.\n\nThus, the translated code should work."
