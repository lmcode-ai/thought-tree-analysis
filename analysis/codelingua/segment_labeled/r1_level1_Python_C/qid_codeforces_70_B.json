So, perhaps in the main function, after splitting into a part, process it step by step. Let's structure the code as follows: Read the input line. Split into parts, for each part:\n\n   trim whitespace. if empty \u2192 skip.\n\n   else append '.' \u2192 sentence. check if sentence length > n \u2192 impossible.\n\n   then manage sumL and ans. So, in code:\n\nint main() {\n\n   int n;\n\n   scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n   getchar();  // consume the newline after n.\n\n   char input_line[1000];\n\n   fgets(input_line, sizeof(input_line), stdin);\n\n   // remove newline. size_t len = strlen(input_line);\n\n   if (len > 0 && input_line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n\n      input_line[len-1] = '\\0';\n\n   }\n\n   int ans = 1;\n\n   int sumL = 0;\n\n   char current_part[1000];\n\n   int current_part_index = 0;\n\n   int i;\n\n   for (i = 0; input_line[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n\n      char c = input_line[i];\n\n      if (strchr(\".?! \", c) ! = NULL) {\n\n         current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n         process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n         current_part_index = 0;\n\n      } else {\n\n         if (current_part_index < 999) {\n\n            current_part[current_part_index++] = c;\n\n         }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   // process the remaining part after loop. current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n   process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n   return 0;\n\n} But then, process_part is a function that takes current_part, ans and sumL as pointers, processes them. But the processing involves:\n\ntrimming the part, appending '.', checking length. So, the function:\n\nvoid process_part(char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   strcat(trimmed, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(trimmed); if (L > 1) {  // because the original code checks if L>1. if (L > n) {\n\n         printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n         exit(0);\n\n      }\n\n      // compute whether adding this sentence would exceed n.\n\n      int space_needed = L + (*sumL > 0 ? 1 : 0);  // if sumL is >0, add 1 for space. if (*sumL + space_needed > n) {\n\n         (*ans)++;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += space_needed;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, when sumL is 0 (i.e., no previous sentences), adding the first sentence doesn't require a space. So sumL is initially 0, and the first sentence is added as is. In the Python code:\n\nsumL is 0 at the start. If sumL + L + (sumL >0) >n \u2192 if sumL is 0, then (sumL>0) is 0, so sumL + L +0 >n \u2192 sumL +L >n.\n\nBut when sumL is 0, adding the first sentence is just sumL = L.\n\nElse, sumL + L +1 (the space) must not exceed n.",

Also, handle the case where the entire string is whitespace, then dest becomes an empty string. So, in code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nvoid trim_whitespace(const char *src, char *dest) {\n\n   size_t len = strlen(src);\n\n   size_t start = 0;\n\n   while (start < len && isspace((unsigned char)src[start])) {\n\n      start++;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t end = len;\n\n   while (end > start && isspace((unsigned char)src[end-1])) {\n\n      end--;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t i;\n\n   for (i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n      dest[i - start] = src[i];\n\n   }\n\n   dest[i - start] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nNow, in the process_part function, after trimming, check if the trimmed string is empty.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's look at the original code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Python code reads an integer n, then processes a sentence split by .?!. For each split part (s), it adds a '.' and checks the length. The logic involves tracking sumL and determining when to increment the answer or if it's impossible.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the input string.\n2. Split the string into sentences using [.?!] as delimiters.\n3. For each sentence (after stripping whitespace and appending '.'), check its length.\n4. If any sentence's length exceeds n, output \"Impossible\".\n5. Otherwise, manage the sumL and ans variables based on whether adding the current sentence would exceed n, considering spaces between sentences.\n\nNow, translating to C. Let's think about the differences between Python and C here.\n\nIn Python, the re.split function splits the input string into parts. But in C, we don't have built-in regex functions as easily. So I'll need to split the string manually. Alternatively, maybe use strtok, but the delimiters are .?!. Wait, but the split is on any of those characters. So each time one of those characters is encountered, the string is split, and the delimiter is removed (since re.split includes the splits after the delimiters). Hmm, maybe process the string by iterating through each character and split whenever a delimiter is found.\n\nAnother approach: the original code splits the input into parts whenever a ., ?, or ! is encountered. Then, each part is stripped of whitespace and a '.' is appended. So, for example, if the input is \"Hello! How are you?\", splitting on [.?!] gives [\"Hello\", \" How are you\", ...], then stripping and adding '.' gives \"Hello.\", \"How are you.\".\n\nSo in C, I need to split the input into tokens separated by .?!. Then process each token.\n\nBut how to split the string into sentences. Let's think.\n\nFirst, read the entire input line. Then, split into sentences by iterating through the string, collecting characters until a delimiter (., ?, !) is found. Then, trim whitespace from the start and end of each sentence, add a '.', and check the length.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read the input string. Need to read until newline, ignoring leading whitespaces? Probably, since in Python input() reads a whole line. So use fgets to read the line.\n\n3. Split the input into sentences. How to do this? Let's process the input string character by character. Collect each sentence into a buffer until we hit a delimiter. Then, process that buffer.\n\nFor example, loop through each character in the input string. When we encounter a ., ?, or !, split here. So, each time one of these characters is found, the current buffer (from the start of the sentence to this delimiter) is a sentence, then the next sentence starts after the delimiter.\n\nWait, but the Python re.split would split on each occurrence of any of the delimiters. So for example, the string \"a.b?c!d\" would be split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"].\n\nWait, re.split(\"[.?!]\", \"a.b?c!d\") gives ['a', '', 'b', '', 'c', '', 'd', ''] or something similar? Because splitting on the delimiters. So each part between the delimiters is a split part. So in the example, after splitting on . ? !, the parts are \"a\", \"\", \"b\", \"\", \"c\", \"\", \"d\", and the remaining part after the last delimiter.\n\nBut in the Python code, they process each split s, then strip() it and add a '.'. So if the split part is empty after stripping, it's skipped.\n\nSo in C, perhaps iterate through the input string, collect each substring between delimiters, then process each substring.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over the input string, splitting each time a delimiter (., ?, !) is found.\n\n- For each such substring, trim leading and trailing whitespace, then append a '.'.\n\n- Then process each of these processed substrings.\n\nSo for example, the input line \"Hello! How are you?\" would be split into \"Hello\" (after !), then \" How are you\" (after ?). Then trimming and appending '.' gives \"Hello.\" and \"How are you.\".\n\nSo in C code:\n\nRead the input string, then parse it into sentences:\n\n- Initialize a buffer to collect characters.\n\n- Loop through each character in the input string:\n\n   - if the current character is a delimiter (., ?, !), then:\n\n      - process the collected buffer (trim whitespace, add '.', check length).\n\n      - reset the buffer.\n\n   - else, add the character to the buffer.\n\nBut also, after the loop ends, process any remaining characters in the buffer (if any).\n\nWait, but after splitting on the delimiters, the split parts are the text between the delimiters. So the code would split the input into parts between each delimiter, and then process each part.\n\nBut in the Python code, they split using re.split, which returns the list of strings split by the regex. So for example, the input \"a.b?c\" would be split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], but in reality, re.split would split on each occurrence of the delimiter. Let's check:\n\nTesting in Python:\n\nimport re\nprint(re.split(\"[.?!]\", \"a.b?c\"))\nOutput: ['a', 'b', 'c', '']\n\nWait, the last empty string comes from splitting after 'c' (assuming the last character is a delimiter, but in this case, it's not. Wait, \"a.b?c\" \u2014 the delimiters are '.' and '?'. So splitting on them would result in the parts:\n\nBetween the start and '.' \u2192 'a'\n\nBetween '.' and '?' \u2192 'b'\n\nBetween '?' and end \u2192 'c'\n\nSo the split result is ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nBut in the code, the split is done by \"[.?!]\", which matches any of those characters. So each occurrence of any of them is a split point. So in the code, the split is on the delimiters, and the delimiters themselves are removed. So the code's split parts are the text between the delimiters.\n\nBut in the Python code, after splitting, each s is processed by s.strip() + '.'.\n\nSo for example, if the split part is an empty string (like between two consecutive delimiters), then s.strip() would be empty, and adding '.' would result in \".\", which has length 1. But then in the code, if L is 1, the if L>1 is false, so it's skipped.\n\nSo in C, when splitting, each time a delimiter is found, the current buffer (from the previous delimiter or start to the current position) is taken as a split part, then the buffer is reset. Then, after the split, process each part.\n\nSo, in C:\n\n- Read the input line.\n\n- Split into parts whenever a delimiter is found.\n\nBut the splitting needs to collect the parts between the delimiters.\n\nHow to implement that:\n\nInitialize a buffer (a char array), current index. Then, loop through each character in the input:\n\nfor each char c in input:\n\n   if c is one of . ? !:\n\n      process the current buffer (trim, add '.', etc.)\n\n      reset buffer to empty.\n\n   else:\n\n      add c to buffer.\n\nBut wait, after the loop, there may be remaining characters in the buffer (if the input doesn't end with a delimiter). So after the loop, check if the buffer is non-empty and process it.\n\nBut in the Python code, the split is done using re.split, which would include all parts between the delimiters, including after the last delimiter. For example, in \"a.b.c\", the splits are ['a', 'b', 'c', ''] (assuming the last character is '.'). Wait, no, if the input is \"a.b.c\", the split would be on the '.' between a and b, then between b and c, then after c. So the splits are ['a', 'b', 'c', ''].\n\nBut in the Python code, after splitting, they process each s in the split list. So in this example, the last split is an empty string. Then s.strip() would be empty, so s.strip() + '.' would be \".\", which has length 1, so L would be 1. Since L>1 is false, it's skipped.\n\nSo in the code, such empty splits (after stripping) are not processed.\n\nSo in C, after splitting, each part is processed as follows:\n\n- trim leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n- if the resulting string is empty, skip it.\n\n- else, add a '.' to the end.\n\nSo in C:\n\nFor each split part:\n\n   trim leading and trailing whitespace \u2192 get a string.\n\n   if the trimmed string is empty \u2192 skip.\n\n   else \u2192 append '.'.\n\n   check the length.\n\nBut how to trim whitespace in C? Need to write a function to trim whitespace from both ends.\n\nSo, first, split the input into parts, then for each part:\n\nTrim whitespace. If the result is non-empty, append '.' and check.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the input line. Use fgets, but need to remove the newline character.\n\nThen, split the input into parts whenever a delimiter (., ?, !) is found.\n\nFor each part:\n\n   trim leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n   if the trimmed part is empty \u2192 skip.\n\n   else \u2192 append '.' to it, forming the sentence.\n\n   calculate the length of this new sentence.\n\n   if length > n \u2192 impossible.\n\n   else, manage the sumL and ans variables.\n\nSo, the main challenges are:\n\n1. Splitting the input into parts correctly.\n\n2. Trimming whitespace.\n\n3. Managing the sumL and ans variables.\n\nLet's tackle splitting first.\n\nIn C, perhaps loop through each character of the input line, collect characters into a buffer until a delimiter is encountered. When a delimiter is found, process the buffer, reset it, and continue. After the loop ends, process any remaining characters in the buffer.\n\nBut need to handle multiple delimiters in a row. For example, \"a..b\" would split into 'a', '', 'b'.\n\nBut the code needs to process each split part, even if it's empty (but after trimming, maybe it becomes empty and is skipped).\n\nSo code steps for splitting:\n\nchar input_line[1000];  // assume max input is 1000 chars.\n\nfgets(input_line, sizeof(input_line), stdin);\n\n// remove newline at end.\n\nsize_t len = strlen(input_line);\n\nif (len > 0 && input_line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n\n   input_line[len-1] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nThen, split:\n\nchar current_part[1000];  // buffer for current part.\n\nint current_part_index = 0;\n\nint i;\n\nfor (i = 0; input_line[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   char c = input_line[i];\n\n   if (strchr(\".?!\", c) != NULL) {\n\n      // delimiter found.\n\n      current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';  // terminate the current part.\n\n      process_part(current_part);\n\n      current_part_index = 0;\n\n   } else {\n\n      if (current_part_index < 999) {  // prevent overflow.\n\n         current_part[current_part_index++] = c;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\n// process the remaining part after last delimiter.\n\ncurrent_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\nprocess_part(current_part);\n\nWait, but in the loop above, when a delimiter is found, the code processes the current_part (from the start or last delimiter up to this delimiter), then resets the buffer. The delimiter is not included in the current_part. So the current_part is the text between delimiters.\n\nThen, after the loop, the code processes the remaining part (which is after the last delimiter). For example, if the input ends with a delimiter, then this part is empty (since the loop processed it when the delimiter was found). But if the input doesn't end with a delimiter, then the remaining part is collected.\n\nThis should split the input into parts between delimiters, exactly as the Python re.split does.\n\nNow, the process_part function: takes a part, trims whitespace, appends '.' if non-empty, then processes the length.\n\nBut in C, functions can't be easily passed around, so perhaps handle this in the main loop.\n\nSo, inside the loop, when a delimiter is found, we process the current_part as follows:\n\nBut in C, need to handle each part as it's split. So perhaps collect all the parts into an array first, then process them. But for efficiency, perhaps process each part as it is split.\n\nBut for code simplicity, maybe collect all the parts into an array of strings, then process them.\n\nBut given that the input can be up to 1000 characters, the maximum number of parts is 1000 (if all characters are delimiters), but that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, process each part as it's split, which is more efficient.\n\nSo, during the splitting, whenever a part is collected (either due to a delimiter or end of input), process it immediately.\n\nSo, the code after splitting would look like:\n\nfor each character in input_line:\n\n   if it's a delimiter:\n\n      process the current_part (trim, add '.', etc.)\n\n      reset current_part.\n\n   else:\n\n      add to current_part.\n\nAfter loop ends, process current_part.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code.\n\nNow, the processing of each part:\n\nvoid process_part(char *part) {\n\n   // trim leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;  // skip empty parts after trimming.\n\n   }\n\n   // append '.'.\n\n   strcat(trimmed, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(trimmed);\n\n   if (L > 1) {\n\n      // process L.\n\n      if (L > n) {\n\n         printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n         exit(0);\n\n      }\n\n      // check sumL and L.\n\n      if (sumL + L + (sumL > 0 ? 1 : 0) > n) {\n\n         ans++;\n\n         sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         sumL += L + (sumL > 0 ? 1 : 0);\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut sumL and ans are variables in the main function, so the processing needs to be done in the main loop. So perhaps in C, handle this inside the main loop.\n\nWait, but in C, functions can't access local variables of other functions unless they are passed as parameters or global variables. So perhaps make sumL and ans global variables, or pass them by reference.\n\nAlternatively, process the parts in the main function.\n\nBut this complicates the code structure. So perhaps collect all the processed sentences (trimmed and added .) into an array, then iterate over them to compute ans and sumL.\n\nAlternatively, during splitting and processing each part, handle the ans and sumL variables.\n\nSo, perhaps in the main function, after splitting into a part, process it step by step.\n\nLet's structure the code as follows:\n\nRead the input line.\n\nSplit into parts, for each part:\n\n   trim whitespace.\n\n   if empty \u2192 skip.\n\n   else append '.' \u2192 sentence.\n\n   check if sentence length > n \u2192 impossible.\n\n   then manage sumL and ans.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint main() {\n\n   int n;\n\n   scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n   getchar();  // consume the newline after n.\n\n   char input_line[1000];\n\n   fgets(input_line, sizeof(input_line), stdin);\n\n   // remove newline.\n\n   size_t len = strlen(input_line);\n\n   if (len > 0 && input_line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n\n      input_line[len-1] = '\\0';\n\n   }\n\n   int ans = 1;\n\n   int sumL = 0;\n\n   char current_part[1000];\n\n   int current_part_index = 0;\n\n   int i;\n\n   for (i = 0; input_line[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n      char c = input_line[i];\n\n      if (strchr(\".?!\", c) != NULL) {\n\n         current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n         process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n         current_part_index = 0;\n\n      } else {\n\n         if (current_part_index < 999) {\n\n            current_part[current_part_index++] = c;\n\n         }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   // process the remaining part after loop.\n\n   current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n   process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n   return 0;\n\n}\n\nBut then, process_part is a function that takes current_part, ans and sumL as pointers, processes them.\n\nBut the processing involves:\n\ntrimming the part, appending '.', checking length.\n\nSo, the function:\n\nvoid process_part(char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   strcat(trimmed, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(trimmed);\n\n   if (L > 1) {  // because the original code checks if L>1.\n\n      if (L > n) {\n\n         printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n         exit(0);\n\n      }\n\n      // compute whether adding this sentence would exceed n.\n\n      int space_needed = L + (*sumL > 0 ? 1 : 0);  // if sumL is >0, add 1 for space.\n\n      if (*sumL + space_needed > n) {\n\n         (*ans)++;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += space_needed;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, when sumL is 0 (i.e., no previous sentences), adding the first sentence doesn't require a space. So sumL is initially 0, and the first sentence is added as is.\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nsumL is 0 at the start.\n\nIf sumL + L + (sumL >0) >n \u2192 if sumL is 0, then (sumL>0) is 0, so sumL + L +0 >n \u2192 sumL +L >n.\n\nBut when sumL is 0, adding the first sentence is just sumL = L.\n\nElse, sumL + L +1 (the space) must not exceed n.\n\nSo, in the code, when sumL is zero, the required space is L, else L +1.\n\nSo in the C code, when sumL is zero, space_needed is L, else L+1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nsumL + L + (sumL >0) \u2192 if sumL>0, then add 1. So the new sum is sumL + L + (sumL>0).\n\nBut sumL is the sum of the lengths plus the spaces. For example, if sumL is the length of the current line (including spaces between sentences), then adding a new sentence requires adding L plus a space (if sumL>0).\n\nSo the space_needed is L + (sumL>0 ? 1 : 0).\n\nBut the sumL is the current total length (including spaces). So when adding a new sentence, the total would be sumL + (space if sumL>0) + L.\n\nIf that exceeds n, then we start a new line (ans +=1), and sumL is set to L.\n\nElse, sumL becomes sumL + L + (sumL>0 ? 1 :0).\n\nSo in the C code, the logic is:\n\nint space_needed = L + ( ( (*sumL) > 0 ) ? 1 : 0 );\n\nif ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n   (*ans) +=1;\n\n   *sumL = L;\n\n} else {\n\n   *sumL += space_needed;\n\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the trim_whitespace function.\n\nNeed to write a function that trims leading and trailing whitespace from a string.\n\nImplementation:\n\nvoid trim_whitespace(const char *src, char *dest) {\n\n   int len = strlen(src);\n\n   int start = 0;\n\n   while (start < len && isspace(src[start])) {\n\n      start++;\n\n   }\n\n   int end = len - 1;\n\n   while (end >= start && isspace(src[end])) {\n\n      end--;\n\n   }\n\n   int i;\n\n   for (i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n\n      dest[i - start] = src[i];\n\n   }\n\n   dest[end - start + 1] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nBut need to include ctype.h for isspace.\n\nAlso, handle the case where the entire string is whitespace, then dest becomes an empty string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nvoid trim_whitespace(const char *src, char *dest) {\n\n   size_t len = strlen(src);\n\n   size_t start = 0;\n\n   while (start < len && isspace((unsigned char)src[start])) {\n\n      start++;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t end = len;\n\n   while (end > start && isspace((unsigned char)src[end-1])) {\n\n      end--;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t i;\n\n   for (i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n      dest[i - start] = src[i];\n\n   }\n\n   dest[i - start] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nNow, in the process_part function, after trimming, check if the trimmed string is empty. If so, return.\n\nOtherwise, append a '.'.\n\nBut what if the trimmed string already ends with a '.'? But in the Python code, after splitting on .?!, the split parts are the text between the delimiters, and then appending '.' again. For example, if the original part was \"Hello.\", after splitting on '.', the split part is \"Hello\", then stripped and appended '.' becomes \"Hello.\".\n\nSo in this case, the code appends a '.' even if the original part ends with a '.'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, perhaps the original code is correct. For example, in the Python code, after splitting, each split part is stripped and a '.' is added. So regardless of what the split part was, the processed sentence ends with a '.'.\n\nSo the code appends '.' even if the original part had other delimiters.\n\nSo the code in C should do the same.\n\nNow, testing some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5\n\nInput: \"Hi! You.\"\n\nSplit into \"Hi\", \" You\", \"\".\n\nProcessing:\n\n\"Hi\" \u2192 trim \u2192 \"Hi\" \u2192 append '.' \u2192 \"Hi.\" (length 3). sumL starts at 0. 0 +3 <=5. sumL becomes 3. ans remains 1.\n\nNext part: \" You\" \u2192 trim \u2192 \"You\" \u2192 append '.' \u2192 \"You.\" (length 4). sumL is 3. sumL +4 +1 (since sumL>0) \u2192 3+4+1=8>5. So ans becomes 2, sumL=4.\n\nNext part: \"\" \u2192 skip.\n\nFinal ans is 2.\n\nBut wait, let's check with the Python code.\n\nIn the Python code:\n\ns = \"Hi! You.\"\n\nsplit into [\"Hi\", \" You\", \"\"]\n\nfor s in split parts:\n\nfirst part: \"Hi\" \u2192 \"Hi.\" \u2192 length 3. sumL is 0. sumL +3 +0 =3 <=5. sumL becomes 3.\n\nsecond part: \" You\" \u2192 stripped to \"You\" \u2192 \"You.\" (length4). sumL is 3. sumL +4 +1 (since sumL>0) \u2192 3+4+1=8>5. So ans +=1 (ans becomes 2), sumL=4.\n\nThird part: \"\" \u2192 stripped is empty \u2192 skipped.\n\nSo ans is 2. Correct.\n\nIn C code, same result.\n\nAnother test case where a sentence is longer than n.\n\nn=3\n\nInput: \"Hello there.\"\n\nSplit into \"Hello there\" (assuming delimiter is '.'). After stripping and appending '.' \u2192 \"Hello there.\" (length 12). Which is longer than 3 \u2192 Impossible.\n\nSo the code should print \"Impossible\".\n\nSo the C code should handle that.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut need to handle the case where the sentence length after adding '.' exceeds n.\n\nIn process_part:\n\nif (L >n) \u2192 print Impossible and exit.\n\nSo in code, when processing a part, after trimming and appending '.', check if L exceeds n.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nAlso, in the main function, after reading n, read the input line. But after reading n with scanf, the newline remains in the input buffer, so we need to consume it before reading the input line with fgets.\n\nSo:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n// consume the rest of the line (including the newline) after n.\n\nint c;\n\nwhile ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n\nThen read the input_line with fgets.\n\nBut this may not be necessary if the input is correctly formatted.\n\nAlternatively, use fgets to read the entire line, then parse n from it. But for simplicity, let's use the above method.\n\nBut code may have issues if input is not properly formatted.\n\nBut assuming the input is correct.\n\nSo, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nvoid trim_whitespace(const char *src, char *dest) {\n\n   size_t len = strlen(src);\n\n   size_t start = 0;\n\n   while (start < len && isspace((unsigned char)src[start])) {\n\n      start++;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t end = len;\n\n   while (end > start && isspace((unsigned char)src[end - 1])) {\n\n      end--;\n\n   }\n\n   for (size_t i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n      dest[i - start] = src[i];\n\n   }\n\n   dest[end - start] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nvoid process_part(const char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   char sentence[1000];\n\n   strcpy(sentence, trimmed);\n\n   strcat(sentence, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(sentence);\n\n   if (L > n) {\n\n      printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n      exit(0);\n\n   }\n\n   if (*sumL == 0) {\n\n      // first sentence.\n\n      *sumL = L;\n\n   } else {\n\n      // check if adding this sentence plus a space exceeds n.\n\n      if (*sumL + 1 + L > n) {\n\n         (*ans)++;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += 1 + L;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, wait, in the Python code, the condition is:\n\nif sumL + L + (sumL>0) >n:\n\nsumL is 0 \u2192 sumL + L +0.\n\nsumL >0 \u2192 sumL + L +1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint space_needed = L + ( (*sumL) > 0 ? 1 : 0 );\n\nif ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n   // need new line.\n\n   (*ans)++;\n\n   *sumL = L;\n\n} else {\n\n   *sumL += space_needed;\n\n}\n\nBut in the code above, in process_part, the current code for checking is:\n\nif (*sumL == 0) {\n\n   *sumL = L;\n\n} else {\n\n   if (*sumL + 1 + L >n) {\n\n      ...\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut this is equivalent to space_needed = L +1 when sumL>0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to code it as:\n\nint space_needed = L + ( (*sumL) > 0 ? 1 : 0 );\n\nif ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n   (*ans) +=1;\n\n   *sumL = L;\n\n} else {\n\n   *sumL += space_needed;\n\n}\n\nWhich is more aligned with the original Python code.\n\nSo, modifying process_part:\n\nvoid process_part(const char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   char sentence[1000];\n\n   strcpy(sentence, trimmed);\n\n   strcat(sentence, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(sentence);\n\n   if (L > n) {\n\n      printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n      exit(0);\n\n   }\n\n   if (L > 1) {  // as per Python code: if L >1.\n\n      int space_needed = L + ( (*sumL) > 0 ? 1 : 0 );\n\n      if ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n         (*ans) +=1;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += space_needed;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, the Python code has:\n\nif L > 1:\n\nso if the sentence length (after appending '.') is >1.\n\nBut in the code, L is the length of the processed sentence (trimmed + '.').\n\nFor example, if the trimmed part is empty, then after appending '.', the length is 1. So L is 1 \u2192 if L>1 is false, so it's skipped.\n\nSo in process_part, after appending '.', check if L>1.\n\nBut in the code above, we have:\n\nif (L >1) {\n\n   ... process ...\n\n}\n\nBut in the code, when the processed sentence is length 1 (like a single '.'), it's skipped.\n\nSo in process_part, after appending '.', check L>1.\n\nBut in the original code, it's:\n\ns = s.strip() + '.'.\n\nL = len(s)\n\nif L>1:\n\n   process.\n\nSo the C code must do the same.\n\nThus, the process_part function should only process sentences where L>1.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nint L = strlen(sentence);\n\nif (L >1) {\n\n   if (L >n) {\n\n      ...\n\n   }\n\n   compute space_needed, etc.\n\n}\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nvoid process_part(const char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   char sentence[1000];\n\n   strcpy(sentence, trimmed);\n\n   strcat(sentence, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(sentence);\n\n   if (L > 1) {\n\n      if (L > n) {\n\n         printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n         exit(0);\n\n      }\n\n      int space_needed = L + ( (*sumL) > 0 ? 1 : 0 );\n\n      if ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n         (*ans) +=1;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += space_needed;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing case where a sentence is exactly n.\n\nExample:\n\nn=5.\n\nSentence \"abc.\" \u2192 after trimming and appending '.', becomes \"abc..\"? No, wait.\n\nWait, original part is \"abc\" (split on '.'), then append '.' \u2192 \"abc.\" (length 4). So L=4. sumL=0. sumL +4=4 <=5. sumL becomes4.\n\nAnother sentence: \"d.\" \u2192 after appending '.', becomes \"d..\"? No, original part is \"d\", append '.' \u2192 \"d.\" (length 2). sumL=4. space_needed=2+1=5. sumL+5=9>5. So new line, ans=2, sumL=2.\n\nSo ans is 2.\n\nIn code, correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, in the main function, after processing all parts, print ans.\n\nBut what if all parts are skipped (no sentences processed)? For example, input is all delimiters with empty parts. Then ans remains 1, but sumL is 0. But according to the problem statement, is this possible? The problem likely expects at least one sentence, but according to the code, if no sentences are processed, ans is 1.\n\nBut according to the Python code, the initial ans is 1. So the C code should output 1 in that case.\n\nBut need to confirm the problem statement's requirements.\n\nAssuming that the code is correct as per the Python code.\n\nThus, the final code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nvoid trim_whitespace(const char *src, char *dest) {\n\n   size_t len = strlen(src);\n\n   size_t start = 0;\n\n   while (start < len && isspace((unsigned char)src[start])) {\n\n      start++;\n\n   }\n\n   size_t end = len;\n\n   while (end > start && isspace((unsigned char)src[end - 1])) {\n\n      end--;\n\n   }\n\n   for (size_t i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n      dest[i - start] = src[i];\n\n   }\n\n   dest[end - start] = '\\0';\n\n}\n\nvoid process_part(const char *part, int *ans, int *sumL, int n) {\n\n   char trimmed[1000];\n\n   trim_whitespace(part, trimmed);\n\n   if (strlen(trimmed) == 0) {\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   char sentence[1000];\n\n   strcpy(sentence, trimmed);\n\n   strcat(sentence, \".\");\n\n   int L = strlen(sentence);\n\n   if (L > 1) {\n\n      if (L > n) {\n\n         printf(\"Impossible\\n\");\n\n         exit(0);\n\n      }\n\n      int space_needed = L + ( (*sumL) > 0 ? 1 : 0 );\n\n      if ( (*sumL) + space_needed > n ) {\n\n         (*ans) +=1;\n\n         *sumL = L;\n\n      } else {\n\n         *sumL += space_needed;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n   int n;\n\n   scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n   // consume the remaining newline.\n\n   int c;\n\n   while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n\n   char input_line[1000];\n\n   fgets(input_line, sizeof(input_line), stdin);\n\n   // remove newline.\n\n   size_t len = strlen(input_line);\n\n   if (len > 0 && input_line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n\n      input_line[len-1] = '\\0';\n\n   }\n\n   int ans = 1;\n\n   int sumL = 0;\n\n   char current_part[1000] = {0};\n\n   int current_part_index = 0;\n\n   for (int i = 0; input_line[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n      char c = input_line[i];\n\n      if (strchr(\".?!\", c) != NULL) {\n\n         current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n         process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n         current_part_index = 0;\n\n      } else {\n\n         if (current_part_index < 999) {\n\n            current_part[current_part_index++] = c;\n\n         }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   // process the remaining part after loop.\n\n   current_part[current_part_index] = '\\0';\n\n   process_part(current_part, &ans, &sumL, n);\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n   return 0;\n\n}\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n1. Buffer overflow: the current_part is a char array of size 1000. So if a part is longer than 999 characters, it will overflow. But the problem likely has constraints that the input is manageable.\n\n2. The trim_whitespace function may have issues if the trimmed string is exactly 999 characters. But since the sentence is appended with a '.', the max length after trimming and appending would be 999+1=1000, which is handled by the sentence array (1000 chars).\n\n3. The code uses 1000 as a buffer size; perhaps better to use a larger buffer, but for the problem's purposes, this is acceptable.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nI am a girl. I am a student.\n\nThe Python code would split this into [\"I am a girl\", \" I am a student\", ...].\n\nProcessing the first split: \"I am a girl\" \u2192 trim \u2192 \"I am a girl\" + '.' \u2192 \"I am a girl.\" \u2192 L=11. 11>5 \u2192 Impossible.\n\nSo output is \"Impossible\".\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n15\n\nI am a boy. I am a student.\n\nSplit into \"I am a boy\", \" I am a student\".\n\nProcessing:\n\n\"I am a boy\" \u2192 \"I am a boy.\" \u2192 length 10. sumL=0 \u2192 10 <=15. sumL=10.\n\nNext part: \" I am a student\" \u2192 \"I am a student.\" \u2192 length 14. sumL=10. sumL +14 +1 =25>15. So ans increments to 2, sumL=14.\n\nNo more parts. Ans is 2.\n\nSo the code should output 2.\n\nAnother test case where sumL exactly equals n.\n\nn=10.\n\nSentence \"123456789.\" \u2192 after processing, L=10. sumL=0: sumL +10 =10 \u2192 sumL=10.\n\nNext sentence \"a.\" \u2192 L=2. sumL=10. sumL +2 +1=13>10 \u2192 ans=2, sumL=2.\n\nTotal ans is 2.\n\nSo the code should output 2.\n\nThus, the code should handle these cases correctly."
