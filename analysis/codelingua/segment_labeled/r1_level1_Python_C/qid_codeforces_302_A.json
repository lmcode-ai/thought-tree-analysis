  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Python code does.\n\nFirst, the Python code reads two integers, n and m. Then it reads a string (probably a sequence of '+' and '-') and counts the number of '-'. Let's call this count sa. Then sa is set to the minimum of (n - sa, sa), so the smaller of the two counts: the number of '-' and the number of '+'.\n\nNext, for m queries, each query has two integers a and b. For each, they subtract a from b to get some value. Then check two conditions: if b is odd (b%2 is 1) and if b is less than or equal to 2*sa. If both conditions are true, append \"1\\n\" to the result, else \"0\\n\". Finally, all the results are joined and printed.\n\nSo translating this to C. Let's think step by step.\n\nIn C, we need to read input. The first line is n and m. Then read a string (sa) which is of length n. Wait, the Python code uses input().split() for n and m, then input() for the string. So the string is the next line.\n\nSo in C:\n\nRead n and m.

Then output a newline.\n\nWait, the Python code uses (b % 2 and ... ) which in Python is equivalent to (b % 2 !=0) because 0 is False. So in C, we need to check if b is odd.\n\nBut in the Python code, after a, b are read, they compute b -= a. Wait, no. Wait, the code says a and b are read, then b -=a. So the new b is (original b - a). Then check if (new_b % 2) is 1 and new_b <= 2*sa.

If both, output 1, else 0. Then a newline.\n\nNow, in C, the output is built as a string and then printed at once. But in the Python code, they collect the strings in a list and then join. However, in C, for each query, we can directly print the result, which is more efficient. But the original code may do it that way to avoid multiple I/O calls. However, for the purposes of C, perhaps just printing each result as we compute it is better.\n\nBut the original code in Python appends to a list and then joins. So for m queries, the output is a sequence of m \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\" strings. So when printed, it's all concatenated. So in C, for each query, we can printf(\"0\\n\") or \"1\\n\", but that would involve m calls to printf. Alternatively, we can build a buffer (like a char array) and then write all at once. But for m up to perhaps 1e5, building a buffer may be more efficient.\n\nBut in the Python code, the output is built as a list of \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\", then joined. So for m elements, each is two characters. So the total length is m*2. For C, we can allocate a buffer of size 2*m +1 (each line is 1 or 0 followed by a newline). Then for each query, write into the buffer, then at the end, print it all at once.\n\nSo in C:\n\nWe can create a char array of size 2*m +1. Then for each of the m queries, compute the result and write '1' or '0' followed by '\\n' into the buffer. Then, after processing all queries, print the buffer.\n\nBut in C, m can be up to, perhaps, 1e5 or even larger. So the buffer needs to be dynamically allocated. Since m is read from input, we can allocate the buffer once we know m.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the string (count '-' to get sa). Then compute sa as min(n - sa, sa).\n\nAllocate a buffer of size 2*m +1 (each m entries are two characters). Or, perhaps, 2*m, since each is two characters. Then, for each of the m queries, process and write into the buffer. Then, at the end, write the buffer as a string.\n\nBut how to handle the buffer. Let's think.\n\nEach query's result is either '0\\n' or '1\\n', which is two characters. So for m queries, the total is 2*m characters. So the buffer can be a char array of size 2*m +1, with the last being '\\0' to terminate the string.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, m: scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\nRead the string: char s[n+1]; scanf(\"%s\", s);\n\ncount the number of '-': sa = 0; for (int i=0; i <n; i++) if (s[i] == '-') sa++;\n\nsa = (n - sa) < sa ? (n - sa) : sa; // because sa is the count of '-', min between that and n - sa.\n\nThen, allocate a buffer: char *result = (char *)malloc(2*m +1); if m is up to 1e5, 2e5+1 bytes is manageable.\n\nBut wait, in C, can't declare variable length arrays with dynamic sizes. So for m read from input, m could be up to 1e5, which is okay for malloc.\n\nThen, for each query:\n\nRead a and b: scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\ncompute b -= a;\n\nCheck if (b % 2 != 0) and (abs(b) <= 2*sa). Wait, wait: original code checks if b <= sa<<1 (i.e., 2*sa). But in the code, after b is computed as (original_b -a), which could be negative. For example, original_b -a could be a negative number. But the code checks if this value is <= 2*sa. Wait, but 2*sa is a non-negative number. So for example, if b is negative, then 2*sa is >=0, so a negative b would be <= 2*sa. But in the original code, the condition is (b <= 2*sa). So even if b is negative, it would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut in the original code, the Python code's condition is (b <= sa <<1). So for example, if b is -3 and sa is 2, 2*sa is 4. So -3 <=4 is true. So the condition would pass for the second part. But the first part is (b %2 and ...). So, for example, if b is -3, then -3 mod 2 is 1 in Python (since Python's modulo returns same sign as divisor). Wait, in Python, (-3) %2 is 1. So in the code, if b is negative and odd, then b%2 is 1. So the condition would check if (b is odd) and (b <= 2*sa). So in the C code, we have to replicate this.\n\nIn C, the modulo operator returns a remainder with the same sign as the dividend. So for example, (-3) % 2 is -1 in C. So (b %2) in C would be -1 for negative odd numbers, which is not equal to 1. So in that case, the condition (b %2) would be non-zero (since for -3%2 is -1, which is not zero). Wait, but (b %2 !=0) would be true for any odd b, positive or negative. Because -3 %2 is -1, which is not zero. So in C, (b %2 !=0) is equivalent to checking if b is odd, regardless of sign.\n\nWait, for even numbers: 4%2 is 0. For 3%2 is 1. For -3%2, in C, the result is -1. So (b%2 !=0) is true if b is odd. So the condition (b%2) being true (non-zero) is equivalent to b being odd. So in C, the condition is ( (b %2 != 0) && (b <= 2*sa) ). But wait, in the Python code, the condition is (b %2 and ...). In Python, 0 is False, any other integer is True. So for example, if b is even, then b%2 is 0 \u2192 False, so the entire condition is False. So in C, we need to check if (b %2 != 0) \u2192 which is the same as (b is odd).\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the condition is (b %2 and ...). So in Python, that's equivalent to ( (b%2) != 0 ) and (b <= 2*sa). So in C, same logic.\n\nSo in C, for each query, compute new_b = original_b - a. Then check if ( (new_b %2 !=0) && (new_b <= 2*sa) ). If yes, output '1', else '0'.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the condition is (b %2 and b <= sa <<1). So the first part is True if b%2 is non-zero (i.e., b is odd). The second part is True if b <= 2*sa. So in C, same conditions.\n\nBut what if new_b is negative? Because the original code's condition would still allow it. For example, new_b is -3, which is odd. 2*sa is 4. Then -3 <=4 is true. So the condition is true.\n\nSo in C, the code should check ( (new_b %2 !=0) ) and (new_b <= 2*sa ). So that's correct.\n\nNow, for each query, after reading a and original_b, compute new_b = original_b -a. Then check the two conditions. Then write '1' or '0' followed by '\\n' into the buffer.\n\nSo in the buffer, for each query, we need to write two characters. For example, first query at position 0 and 1, second at 2 and 3, etc.\n\nSo for the i-th query (0-based), the index is i*2. So for each query, we can do:\n\nif (condition) {\n    result[i*2] = '1';\n} else {\n    result[i*2] = '0';\n}\nresult[i*2 +1] = '\\n';\n\nThen, after all m queries, the buffer is filled. Then, add a null terminator at the end? Well, since we have exactly 2*m characters, which includes m '\\n's. But when printing, we can use fwrite to write exactly 2*m bytes, since each line is two characters. But in C, if we have a string, it's terminated with a '\\0'. However, for writing to stdout, using fwrite is more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, build a buffer as a char array with 2*m elements, and then use fwrite(result, 1, 2*m, stdout);.\n\nSo in code:\n\nAfter processing all m queries, we can:\n\nfwrite(result, 1, 2*m, stdout);\n\nBut to avoid the terminating null character, which is not part of the output. So the buffer must not have a '\\0' at the end, but fwrite will write exactly 2*m bytes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nAllocate the buffer as 2*m characters. For each query i (0 <= i < m), set the two characters. Then fwrite the buffer.\n\nSo in code:\n\nchar *result = malloc(2 * m * sizeof(char));\n// then process each query:\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    int a, b;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n    b -= a;\n    int cond = (b % 2 != 0) && (b <= 2 * sa);\n    result[2*i] = cond ? '1' : '0';\n    result[2*i +1] = '\\n';\n}\nfwrite(result, 1, 2*m, stdout);\nfree(result);\n\nBut what about the case when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is probably at least 1, but code should handle m=0. But the code reads m as input, so in that case, the loop won't execute.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, the variable 'ss' is a list of '0\\n' or '1\\n', each being two characters, then joined into a single string and printed. So the output is m lines, each with 0 or 1.\n\nSo in C, the code would generate a buffer of 2*m bytes, which when printed is exactly that.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the string.\n\nCompute sa as count of '-', then sa = min(sa, n - sa).\n\nProcess m queries, read a and b, compute b -=a.\n\nCheck if b is odd and <= 2*sa.\n\nStore '0\\n' or '1\\n' in the buffer.\n\nThen output the buffer.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The string after n and m is read correctly. For example, after reading n and m with scanf, there may be a newline left in the input buffer. Then, reading the string with scanf(\"%s\") may skip leading whitespace (including newlines). So that's okay. Because the next input is the string, which is a sequence of '+' and '-', with no spaces. So scanf(\"%s\") will read the entire string, skipping any leading whitespace.\n\n- Allocating the buffer: if m is large, but in programming competition problems, m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nAnother possible optimization: in the original code, the loop for m queries appends to the list. So the order is correct. In the C code, the loop for m queries processes each query in order, writing to the buffer in order.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    char s[n+1];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s);\n    int sa = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (s[i] == '-') sa++;\n    }\n    sa = (n - sa) < sa ? (n - sa) : sa;\n\n    char *result = (char *)malloc(2 * m * sizeof(char));\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        b -= a;\n        int cond = (b % 2 != 0) && (b <= 2 * sa);\n        result[2*i] = cond ? '1' : '0';\n        result[2*i +1] = '\\n';\n    }\n    fwrite(result, 1, 2*m, stdout);\n    free(result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the condition (b <= 2*sa), what if 2*sa is a very large number? But in the problem statement, it's possible that 2*sa is up to 2*(n/2) =n. So no problem.\n\nTesting:\n\nSample input:\n\nLet's take a sample from the problem.\n\nSuppose n=3, m=2.\n\nInput string is \"--+\", which has 2 '-', so sa is min(1,2) \u2192 1.\n\nThen queries:\n\nFor example, a=1, original_b=3. Then new_b =3-1=2. Check if 2 is odd (no), so 0.\n\nAnother query: a=2, original_b=5 \u2192 new_b=3. Check if 3 is odd (yes) and 3 <= 2*1=2 \u2192 no. So 0.\n\nSo output would be two lines: 0 and 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, input string \"-----\" (5 '-'), sa is min(0,5) \u21920.\n\nQueries: a=1, b=1. new_b=0. Check if 0 is odd (no). So 0.\n\nBut 2*sa is 0. So any new_b <=0. But new_b=0 is allowed. But since it's even, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, input \"++++-\", so sa is 1. min(4,1) \u21921.\n\nQuery: a=0, b=1 \u2192 new_b=1. Check if 1 is odd (yes), and 1 <=2 \u2192 yes. So output 1.\n\nSo code should generate 1 followed by a newline.\n\nIn code:\n\nb=1-0=1. 1%2 !=0 \u2192 yes. 1 <=2*1 \u2192 yes. So cond is 1. So result[0] = '1', result[1] = '\\n'.\n\nSo the code would output \"1\\n\".\n\nSo code seems correct."
