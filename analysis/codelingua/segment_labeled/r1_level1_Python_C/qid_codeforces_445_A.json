So same as in Python.\n\nYes, because in the Python code, the loop is for i in range(n), which is 0-based. Same in C.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input. For example, if input is:\n\n3 3\n...\n...\n...\n\nThen the code should replace each '.' with B and W in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nBut what about if the original line has other characters, like 'W' or 'B'? The code leaves them as is. Which is correct per the Python code.\n\nSo the C code is a direct translation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The line buffer in C is of size m+1. But when reading with scanf(\"%s\", line), if the input line is longer than m characters, it would cause buffer overflow. But the problem's input is guaranteed to be m characters per line. So as per the problem's constraints, this is acceptable.\n\n- In C, variable-length arrays (like line[m+1]) are allowed in C99, but some compilers might not support them. But assuming that the code is being compiled with a C99-compliant compiler, which is common.\n\nAnother approach would be to dynamically allocate the line buffer using malloc. But for simplicity, using a variable-length array is acceptable here.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
