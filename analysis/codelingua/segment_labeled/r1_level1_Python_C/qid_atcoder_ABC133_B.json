But in C, if d is variable, we need to allocate dynamically. So for each point, we can do int *point = malloc(d * sizeof(int)). Then store all these pointers in an array.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and d from input.\n2. Read n points, each with d integers.\n3. For each pair of points (i, j) where i < j, compute the squared distance (sum of (x_i - y_i)^2 for each coordinate). Then take the square root and check if it's an integer. Wait, but in Python, they calculate sqrt and check .is_integer(). But calculating sqrt could lead to floating point inaccuracies. Maybe a better approach is to compute the squared distance, check if it's a perfect square.\n\nWait, because if the distance is an integer, then the squared distance must be a perfect square. So instead of computing the square root and checking if it's an integer, which could have floating point precision issues, we can compute the squared distance and check if it's a perfect square. That's more efficient and avoids floating points altogether. Oh right! Because the original code computes the distance as sqrt(sum), which is integer if and only if sum is a perfect square. So instead of dealing with floating points, we can compute the sum of squares and check if that sum is a perfect square. That's a better approach, especially in C where dealing with floating points can introduce precision errors.\n\nSo modifying the Python code to check if the squared distance is a perfect square would be better, but the original code uses the sqrt method. However, since the user wants a direct translation, maybe proceed as per original code. Wait, but in C, checking if the sqrt is an integer via floating points is error-prone. For example, for a sum like 25, sqrt gives 5.0, which is integer. But if the sum is like 2, sqrt is 1.414..., which isn't. But due to floating point precision, even perfect squares might not be represented exactly. For example, for a very large sum that's a perfect square, the sqrt might not be exactly an integer due to floating point precision. So perhaps the original Python code is correct because Python's float.is_integer() checks whether the float is an exact integer, but in practice, for perfect squares up to certain sizes, the sqrt calculation would be precise. However, for very large numbers, this could fail.\n\nBut in C, using sqrt and checking if it's integer would be tricky. So maybe the better approach is to compute the squared sum, then check if it's a perfect square. So how to do that? For the sum s, compute the integer square root, then check if its square equals s.\n\nYes. So for example, sum = s. Compute t = (int)sqrt(s). Then check if t*t == s. If yes, then s is a perfect square, and the distance is t. Otherwise, it's not. So this approach avoids floating points entirely. So that's better.\n\nSo, in the original Python code, changing the method to compute the squared distance, check if it's a perfect square. But wait, the original code uses math.sqrt and then checks is_integer(). So for example, if the distance is 5.0, then it's considered integer. But if the sum is 25, then sqrt is 5.0. So the code is equivalent to checking if the sum is a perfect square.\n\nSo the translation can be optimized by checking if the sum is a perfect square, avoiding floating points. That's better for C. So the plan is:\n\nFor each pair of points, compute the sum of squares of their coordinate differences. Then check if that sum is a perfect square. If yes, increment the count.\n\nSo in C, steps:\n\n1. Read n and d.\n\n2. Read n points, each with d integers. So in C, dynamic allocation. For example:\n\nint **points = malloc(n * sizeof(int *));\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n   points[i] = malloc(d * sizeof(int));\n   read d integers into points[i].\n\n3. For each i from 0 to n-1, and j from i+1 to n-1:\n\n   compute sum = 0;\n   for each k in 0..d-1:\n      diff = points[i][k] - points[j][k];\n      sum += diff * diff;\n\n   check if sum is a perfect square.\n\n   if yes, increment count.\n\nSo the main challenge is to check if sum is a perfect square efficiently.\n\nHow to check if sum is a perfect square in C?\n\nCompute the integer square root. For example, using sqrt from math.h, but that returns a double. Cast to integer and check.\n\nBut again, for very large sums, the sqrt function might not be precise.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCompute t = (int)sqrt(sum);\n\nthen check if t*t == sum or (t+1)*(t+1) == sum. Wait, but perhaps better to compute t as floor(sqrt(sum)), then check if t*t == sum.\n\nBut how to compute the integer square root accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use the sqrt function, cast to integer, then verify.\n\nBut even for sum=25, sqrt(25) is 5.0, so (int)sqrt(25) is 5, 5*5=25, which is correct.\n\nFor sum=26, sqrt(26) is ~5.099, cast to 5. 5^2=25 <26, so no.\n\nBut due to floating-point inaccuracies, for very large numbers, sqrt may return a value that is slightly less than the actual square root. For example, consider sum= (2^30)^2. The sqrt in double can represent that exactly. But for numbers larger than 2^53 (since double has 53 bits of precision), the sqrt might not be precise.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints (probably in programming competition), perhaps the sum can be up to (1e4)^2 * 100 (if each coordinate is up to 1e4 and d is up to 100). For example, if each coordinate difference is up to 1e4, then per dimension squared is 1e8. For d=100, sum is 1e10. The sqrt of that is 1e5, which can be stored exactly as a double. So in this case, the method works.\n\nBut for larger sums, like 1e16, sqrt(1e16) is 1e8, which is exact. Hmm. So for sum up to 1e16, the sqrt would be accurate. So maybe this approach works.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint sum = ...;\n\ndouble s = sqrt(sum);\nint t = (int)s;\n\nif (t * t == sum) {\n    count++;\n}\n\nBut sum is an integer. So for example, sum=25: t=5, 5*5=25 \u2192 yes.\n\nsum=24: sqrt(24) is ~4.898 \u2192 t=4, 4^2=16 !=24.\n\nsum=26: t=5, 5^2=25 !=26.\n\nsum=0: t=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this approach works for perfect squares. But what about when sum is a perfect square but due to floating point precision, sqrt returns a value slightly less than t. For example, sum = t\u00b2 where t is very large. For example, t=1e15. Then t\u00b2=1e30. sqrt(1e30) is 1e15, which is represented exactly. Because 1e15 is within the range of exact integers in double (since 2^53 is about 9e15, so 1e15 is less than that). So for sum up to (2^53)^2, the sqrt can be represented exactly. So this approach works.\n\nSo, in code, for each sum, compute t = (int)sqrt(sum). Then check if t*t == sum. If yes, then count.\n\nSo in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, d;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &d);\n    \n    int **points = (int **)malloc(n * sizeof(int *));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        points[i] = (int *)malloc(d * sizeof(int));\n        for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &points[i][j]);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < d; k++) {\n                int diff = points[i][k] - points[j][k];\n                sum += diff * diff;\n            }\n            double s = sqrt(sum);\n            int t = (int)s;\n            if (t * t == sum) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n    \n    // Free allocated memory\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        free(points[i]);\n    }\n    free(points);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the original approach computes the distance and checks if it's an integer. But here, we are checking if the sum is a perfect square, which is equivalent. So this approach is correct.\n\nBut let's test with sample input. For example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n\nCompute pairs:\n\nPair (0,1): differences (2,2), sum 8. sqrt(8) is ~2.828, not integer. So no.\n\nPair (0,2): differences (4,4), sum 32 \u2192 sqrt ~5.656, no.\n\nPair (1,2): differences (2,2), sum 8 \u2192 no. So count is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n0\n3\n\nSum is (3-0)^2=9. sqrt is 3. So yes. Count is 1.\n\nSo the code would output 1.\n\nAnother test case: two points in 2D with coordinates (0,0) and (3,4). Sum is 9+16=25. sqrt(25)=5 \u2192 yes. So count increments. So code works.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n\nNow, handling memory allocation. Each point is dynamically allocated, and freed at the end. The code uses scanf to read inputs.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if the input is not properly formatted? But the problem assumes that inputs are correct as per the code's expectations.\n\n- Overflow in sum. If d is large and the coordinates are big, the sum could overflow the int type. For example, if d is 1e5 and each coordinate difference is 1e4, then sum would be 1e5 * (1e4)^2 = 1e13, which is larger than the maximum value of int (which is typically 2e9). So in that case, sum should be a long long.\n\nAh, right. In the Python code, integers can be arbitrarily large, but in C, using int for sum could overflow. So to prevent that, sum should be of type long long.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nIn the sum calculation:\n\nlong long sum = 0;\n...\nsum += (long long)diff * diff;\n\nWait, because if diff is large (e.g., 1e5), then diff*diff is 1e10, which may exceed 32-bit int's capacity. So casting to long long.\n\nSo in the loop:\n\nint diff = points[i][k] - points[j][k];\nsum += (long long)diff * diff;\n\nBut even better, declare sum as long long, and compute each term as (long long)diff * diff.\n\nWait, in C, the product of two ints is int. So for example, if diff is 1e5, then diff*diff would be 1e10, which is 10,000,000,000. If int is 32-bit (max 2,147,483,647), this would overflow. So to prevent that, cast diff to long long before multiplying.\n\nSo:\n\nsum += (long long)diff * diff;\n\nYes. Because (long long)diff is a long long, multiplied by diff (int) would promote diff to long long. So the product is long long, and sum (long long) can hold it.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nfor (int k = 0; k < d; k++) {\n    int diff = points[i][k] - points[j][k];\n    sum += (long long)diff * diff;\n}\n\nBut wait, sum is a long long. So the code should declare sum as long long.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nlong long sum = 0;\n\nThus, the modified code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, d;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &d);\n    \n    int **points = (int **)malloc(n * sizeof(int *));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        points[i] = (int *)malloc(d * sizeof(int));\n        for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &points[i][j]);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {\n            long long sum = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < d; k++) {\n                int diff = points[i][k] - points[j][k];\n                sum += (long long)diff * diff;\n            }\n            double s = sqrt(sum);\n            long long t = (long long)s;\n            if (t * t == sum) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        free(points[i]);\n    }\n    free(points);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should handle larger sums without overflow.\n\nAnother possible issue is that sqrt returns a value that is slightly less than the actual integer. For example, if sum is a perfect square, but due to floating point precision, sqrt(sum) is t - 1e-15, then casting to long long would give t-1, and t-1 squared would not equal sum. To avoid this, perhaps use the round function.\n\nBut for sums up to 1e18, the sqrt is calculated correctly as a double. Because double can represent integers up to 2^53 exactly. So if sum is up to (2^53)^2 = 2^106, then sqrt would be exact. But if sum is a perfect square larger than 2^106, then sqrt(sum) may not be exact, but the code would fail. However, given the problem constraints, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, compute the integer square root via binary search. But that's more code. However, for the purposes of code translation, perhaps proceed as per original.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly."
