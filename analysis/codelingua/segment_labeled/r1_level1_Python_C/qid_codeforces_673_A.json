If no gaps found, check the last element's value.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in C, I'll need to read the input. The first input is an integer n. Then, read n integers into an array. Wait, but in the Python code, arr is read as a list split from the input line, which may not have exactly n elements.

Otherwise, output last element +15.\n\nSo translating the loop: in C, for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { ... }.\n\nNow, handling the 'else' clause in Python's for loop. In Python, the 'else' block executes only if the loop didn't break. So in C, after the loop, we need to check whether the loop completed normally. To do that, perhaps use a flag variable. For example, set a flag to 0, and if a break occurs, set the flag to 1. After the loop, if flag is 0, then proceed to the else logic.\n\nAlternatively, in C code:\n\nint found = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 15) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", arr[i-1] + 15);\n        found = 1;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nif (!found) {\n    // handle the else case\n}\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, the else case: check if the last element is 90 or adding 15 to it is >=90.

Then 90, else arr[-1]+15.\n\nBut 90 is the maximum possible, so if arr[-1] +15 is >=90, then output 90.

The code is okay.\n\nAnother possible error: in the for loop, the check is if (arr[i] - arr[i-1] >15). Wait, in the code I wrote in the think process, I have arr[i-1], but in the code, the index would be i-1. For example, in C, when i starts at 1, arr[i] is the second element, arr[i-1] is first.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error: after the first check, the code frees the array and returns. So that's correct, to avoid memory leaks.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test case where n=0. But according to the original code, that's not possible. The code in Python would have arr as empty list, leading to an error when accessing arr[0]. So the problem's input probably ensures that n is at least 1. Hence, the C code can proceed under the same assumption.\n\nSo the code is correct."
