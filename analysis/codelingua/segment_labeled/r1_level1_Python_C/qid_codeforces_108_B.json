So if a[i] < 2*a[i-1], then a[i-1] < 2*a[i-1], which is always true if a[i-1] is positive. But since the array is sorted, a[i] >= a[i-1].

But what if the first line is not just a number but has other characters? Well, in the original Python code, it's read as a string, but the code ignores it. So the C code should read the entire line, regardless.\n\nWait, in the Python code, input() reads a line from stdin, including any characters. So the first input() reads the entire line, but it's discarded. The second input() reads the next line and splits into numbers.\n\nIn C, the code reads the first line (using fgets) and discards. Then reads the next line (with fgets) into buffer. Then splits that line into tokens, converts to integers.\n\nBut what if the first line is empty? Or has multiple numbers? Well, in the Python code, the first input() is read but not processed, so the code would take the next line as the array. So in C, the code is correct as written.\n\nAnother point: the code uses atoi for conversion. But if there are non-numeric tokens, this could cause issues. However, the problem probably assumes that the input is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPossible edge cases:\n\n- Only one element: after reading the array, the loop doesn't run, returns NO.\n\n- All elements the same: since a[i] == a[i-1], the condition is not met.\n\n- Test case where a[i] is exactly 2*a[i-1], which would not trigger the condition.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the C code, when using qsort, the array is sorted in ascending order. Which matches the Python's sort().\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code uses a buffer of size 1,000,000. That's a large buffer, but in practice, it's okay. But if the input line is longer than that, it would cause issues. However, in programming competition problems, this is a common approach. Alternatively, read in chunks, but that's more complex.\n\nSo this should be acceptable for the problem."
