Then a query for m=1, l=3: l-1=2. a[2] - a[0] =1-0=1. Another query for m=2, l=3: a[2] - a[1] =1-1=0. Which is correct. So the C code should work. But one thing to note is that in C, when using scanf to read the string, any leading whitespace is skipped.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's look at what the Python code does step by step.\n\nFirst, the Python code reads a string 'soz' from input. Then it initializes an array 'a' with zeros, which has a length of len(soz) + 1. Wait, wait. So if the string is length N, then a is N+1 elements long. Then, for each i from 1 to len(soz)-1 (since range(1, len(soz)) would go up to len(soz)-1), it sets a[i] to a[i-1]. Then, if the previous character (soz[i-1]) is equal to the current character (soz[i]), it increments a[i] by 1. So this array 'a' is keeping track of the number of consecutive equal characters up to each position, maybe?\n\nThen, the code reads an integer 'n' which is the number of queries. For each query, it reads two numbers m and l, and calculates a[int(l)-1] - a[int(m)-1], appending this to the array 'arr'. Finally, it prints each result in 'arr'.\n\nSo the main idea is that for a range [m, l], the value is the count of times consecutive characters are equal from the start of the string up to l-1, minus the same count up to m-1. So this gives the number of consecutive pairs in the substring from m-1 to l-1.\n\nWait, but in Python, the indices might be a bit tricky. Let me see. For example, if the string is \"abba\", then len(soz) is 4. The loop runs i from 1 to 3 (since range(1,4) is 1,2,3). For each i, a[i] starts as a[i-1]. Then, if soz[i-1] == soz[i], add 1. So for i=1, check index 0 and 1 of soz. So the array 'a' is built such that a[i] represents the number of consecutive equal pairs from the start up to index i-1. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"aabb\". Then:\n\ni runs from 1 to 3 (since len(soz) is 4).\n\nFor i=1: check soz[0] and soz[1]. If they are equal, a[1] = a[0] + 1. So a[1] is 1 if equal, else 0.\n\nFor i=2: check soz[1] and soz[2]. a[2] starts as a[1], then adds 1 if the pair is equal.\n\nSo a[i] counts the number of times consecutive characters are equal up to the i-th position in the array. Because for each position i in the array a (from 1 to len(soz)), it's checking the previous character in the string (soz[i-1] and soz[i]). Wait, the string indices are soz[i-1] and soz[i], which for i starting at 1 would compare the first two characters. So the array a is built such that a[i] is the number of consecutive equal pairs in the string from the start up to position i (exclusive?), or something like that. Then, when the query is m and l, the code takes a[l-1] - a[m-1], which gives the count of consecutive pairs between positions m-1 and l-2 in the original string. Because a[l-1] is the cumulative up to position l-1, but each a[k] represents the count up to the k-th element in the array, which corresponds to the first k characters of the string. Wait, perhaps the a array's indices are a bit confusing here.\n\nIn any case, the key is to replicate the same logic in C.\n\nNow, translating to C:\n\nFirst, read the input string. In C, we can use fgets or scanf to read a string. But need to be careful with buffer overflows. Let's assume the input string is up to some reasonable length, say 100000 characters. So we'll declare a buffer of sufficient size.\n\nThen, create an array 'a' of size len(soz) + 1. Wait, but in Python, len(soz) is the length of the string. For example, if the string is \"abc\", len is 3, so a has 4 elements (indices 0-3). Then, in the loop, for i in range(1, len(soz)), which for len=3 would be i=1 and 2. So for each i from 1 to len(soz)-1.\n\nWait, let's say the input string is \"abc\". Then len(soz) is 3. The loop runs i from 1 to 2 (since range(1,3) is 1,2). For each i, a[i] is set to a[i-1], then check soz[i-1] and soz[i]. Wait, so when i is 1, check soz[0] and soz[1]. For i=2, check soz[1] and soz[2]. So the array a's index i corresponds to the first i characters of the string. Because a[1] is after checking the first two characters (indices 0 and 1). So a[i] represents the number of consecutive equal pairs in the string up to position i (so up to the i-th character, but perhaps not including it? Or including it?\n\nHmm. Let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"aab\".\n\nThen len(soz) is 3. The loop runs i from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1:\n\nsoz[0] and soz[1] are both 'a', so a[1] = a[0] (0) +1 \u2192 1.\n\ni=2:\n\nsoz[1] is 'a', soz[2] is 'b'. Not equal. So a[2] = a[1] \u2192 1.\n\nSo the array a is [0,1,1, ...], with a[3] being 0 (since the original array was initialized to len(soz)+1 elements). Wait, no, the original a is initialized to [0]*(len(soz)+1). So for len(soz) 3, a has 4 elements (0,0,0,0) initially. Then, during the loop (i from 1 to 2), a[1] is set to a[0] (0), then if soz[0] and soz[1] are equal, add 1. Then a[2] is a[1] (1), then check soz[1] and soz[2], which are 'a' and 'b' \u2192 no addition. So a becomes [0,1,1,0].\n\nSo for a query m and l, say m=1, l=3. Then a[2-1] - a[1-1] \u2192 a[2] - a[0] = 1 -0 =1. Which is correct because between positions 0 and 2 (inclusive?), the consecutive pairs are (0,1) and (1,2). So the pair (0,1) is equal, but (1,2) is not. So the count is 1. Which matches the result.\n\nSo the code works by precomputing the cumulative sum of consecutive equal pairs up to each index, and then for a query [m, l], it's the sum from the (m)th position to (l-1)th position. Because the a array's value at position i is the sum up to i-1.\n\nSo when we subtract a[m-1] from a[l-1], we get the number of pairs in the range starting at m-1 (since a[m-1] is the sum up to m-2, maybe? Because a[i] is the sum up to i-1? Wait, in the code, the a array is built such that a[i] is the number of pairs up to the i-th index in the loop. Let me think again.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nFor each i starting at 1 up to len(soz)-1.\n\na[i] = a[i-1]\n\nthen, if soz[i-1] == soz[i], a[i] +=1.\n\nSo for example, a[1] counts the pair at positions 0 and 1.\n\na[2] starts with a[1], then checks positions 1 and 2.\n\nSo a[i] represents the total number of consecutive pairs from the start up to and including the pair at positions (i-1) and i.\n\nWait, no. For i in the loop, the code checks soz[i-1] and soz[i], so for i from 1 to len(soz)-1. For a string of length n, len(soz) is n. So the loop runs i from 1 to n-1. For each i, the code checks the pair (i-1, i) in the string. So a[i] is the cumulative sum of these pairs up to index i. So a is of length len(soz)+1 = n+1. So a[0] is 0, a[1] is 0 + (if pair 0-1 is equal), a[2] is a[1] + pair 1-2, etc.\n\nSo for a string of length n, the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1. Each a[i] is the sum of pairs up to the i-th step. So a[i] is the number of consecutive equal pairs from the start up to the (i)th index of the a array. For example, a[i] gives the count of pairs (0,1), (1,2), ..., (i-1, i) if they are equal.\n\nWait, no. Because for i=1, we check pair 0-1. For i=2, pair 1-2, etc. So a[i] is the count of pairs from 0-1 up to (i-1)-i. So for a string of length 4 (indices 0,1,2,3), the loop runs i from 1 to 3. So for i=3, we check pair 2-3. So the a array after the loop will have a[3] equal to the sum of pairs 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\nBut the a array has length len(soz)+1, which is 5 in this case. So the a array's indices go up to 4. But the loop only fills up to index 3 (since i runs up to len(soz)-1, which is 3). So a[0] remains 0, a[1], a[2], a[3] are filled, a[4] remains 0.\n\nThen, for a query m and l, which are converted to integers. For example, m=1, l=3. Then a[l-1] is a[2], and a[m-1] is a[0]. So the difference is a[2] - a[0], which counts the pairs from 0-1 and 1-2. Which is correct for the substring from m=1 to l=3 (the original indices m-1=0 to l-1=2). So the pairs are (0,1) and (1,2). So the code's calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the key steps in C would be:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n\n2. Compute the array a.\n\n3. Read n queries.\n\n4. For each query, compute a[l-1 -1] - a[m-1 -1]? Wait, no. Wait, in Python, the code takes m and l as input, converts to integers, then does a[int(l)-1] - a[int(m)-1].\n\nSo for a query (m, l), the code computes a[l-1] - a[m-1].\n\nBut in the Python code, the a array is of length len(soz) +1. For example, for a string of length 3, a has 4 elements, indices 0-3.\n\nThe loop for i in range(1, len(soz)) would run i=1, 2 (since len(soz) is 3, so range(1,3) is 1,2). So a[1] and a[2] are computed, a[3] remains 0.\n\nWait, in the original code:\n\nsoz = input()\n\na = [0]*(len(soz)+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(soz)):\n\n    a[i] = a[i-1]\n\n    if soz[i-1] == soz[i]:\n\n        a[i] +=1\n\nSo for len(soz) being 3, the loop runs i=1,2. So a[1] and a[2] are set. a[3] remains 0.\n\nThen, for a query with l=3, l-1 would be 2. So a[2] is the sum up to i=2, which includes pairs (0-1) and (1-2).\n\nSo for a query (m, l), the code computes a[l-1] - a[m-1].\n\nSo in C, the same steps.\n\nNow, translating to C:\n\nFirst, read the string. Let's use a buffer of size, say, 100000 +1 for null terminator.\n\nThen compute the a array. The length of a is strlen(soz)+1. So we can allocate it dynamically.\n\nThen process the queries.\n\nBut in C, we need to handle dynamic memory. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string:\n\n   char soz[100001];\n   scanf(\"%100000s\", soz);\n\n   (But note that this will read up to 100000 characters, avoiding overflow.)\n\n2. Compute the length:\n\n   int len = strlen(soz);\n\n3. Allocate array a:\n\n   int *a = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * (len + 1));\n\n   Initialize all elements to 0. But in the Python code, a is initialized to zeros. So in C, after allocation, we need to set all elements to 0. Since malloc doesn't initialize, we can use calloc instead.\n\n   a = calloc(len +1, sizeof(int));\n\n   Because calloc initializes to zero.\n\n4. Fill the array a:\n\n   for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {  // because in Python, range(1, len(soz)) is i from 1 to len(soz)-1-1? Wait, len(soz) is the length of the string. The loop is for i in range(1, len(soz)), which for len(soz) being 3, i would be 1 and 2. So in C, the loop should run for i from 1 to len-1, exclusive. So i < len.\n\n   Because in Python, range(a, b) is a <= i < b. So for range(1, len_soz), the loop runs for i=1,2,..., len_soz-1-1? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if len_soz is 3, then range(1, len_soz) is 1, 2. So in C, the loop is for (i = 1; i < len_soz; i++). Because len_soz is 3, i goes up to 2.\n\n   So yes.\n\n   So:\n\n   for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\n\n       a[i] = a[i-1];\n\n       if (soz[i-1] == soz[i]) {\n\n           a[i]++;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   Wait, because in the Python code, for each i in the loop, they check soz[i-1] and soz[i]. So in C, i starts at 1, and soz[i-1] and soz[i] are the consecutive characters.\n\n5. Read n:\n\n   int n;\n\n   scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n6. Process n queries. For each query, read m and l, compute a[l-1] - a[m-1], and store or print.\n\nBut in C, reading m and l as integers. But the Python code reads them as input().split(), which in C would be reading two integers.\n\nSo for each query:\n\n   int m, l;\n\n   scanf(\"%d %d\", &m, &l);\n\n   Then compute the result as a[l-1] - a[m-1].\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, after reading m and l as strings, they convert them to integers, then do a[int(l)-1] - a[int(m)-1]. So in C, l-1 and m-1 are the indices. So:\n\n   result = a[l-1] - a[m-1];\n\n   Then, collect these results and print them after all queries are processed, or print them immediately.\n\nIn the Python code, the results are collected in an array and printed at the end. But for efficiency in C, perhaps it's better to print each result immediately.\n\nSo, for each query:\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", a[l-1] - a[m-1]);\n\nBut we need to make sure that the indices l-1 and m-1 are within the bounds of the array a. For example, if the string is empty, but the code probably handles that. So assuming that the input is correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut there are some edge cases to consider. For example, if the string is length 0 (but the problem probably says the input is non-empty). Or queries where m or l are out of bounds. But the Python code assumes the input is correct.\n\nSo the C code would look something like this:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char soz[100001];\n    scanf(\"%100000s\", soz);\n    int len = strlen(soz);\n    int *a = calloc(len + 1, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n    for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\n        a[i] = a[i-1];\n        if (soz[i-1] == soz[i]) {\n            a[i]++;\n        }\n    }\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int m, l;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &m, &l);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a[l-1] - a[m-1]);\n    }\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, after the loop, the array a is [0, ...] up to a[len(soz)], which in C would be a[len]. But in the loop, i runs up to len-1. For example, len is the length of the string. So for a string of length 3, the loop runs i=1 and 2. So a[1] and a[2] are filled. a[3] is 0 (initialized by calloc). But in queries where l-1 is len, then a[l-1] would be a[len], which is 0. But in the Python code, since a is length len+1, a[len(soz)] is 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, when the string has length 1, len is 1. Then the loop for i in range(1, len(soz)) is range(1,1), which doesn't run. So a remains all zeros. Then, any query where m and l are 1 would compute a[0] - a[0] =0. Which is correct since there are no consecutive pairs.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nTesting with the example where soz is \"aab\":\n\nlen is 3.\n\nLoop runs i=1 and 2.\n\ni=1: a[1] = a[0] (0). soz[0] is 'a', soz[1] is 'a', so a[1] becomes 1.\n\ni=2: a[2] = a[1] (1). soz[1] is 'a', soz[2] is 'b' \u2192 no change. a[2] remains 1.\n\na[3] is 0.\n\nThen a query for m=1, l=3: l-1=2. a[2] - a[0] =1-0=1.\n\nAnother query for m=2, l=3: a[2] - a[1] =1-1=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the C code should work.\n\nBut one thing to note is that in C, when using scanf to read the string, any leading whitespace is skipped. So if the input has leading spaces, but the problem probably expects the input to be a non-empty string. Also, the Python code uses input(), which reads a line without the trailing newline. But in C, scanf(\"%s\") reads a string up to whitespace, which may not be correct if the input contains spaces. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the input string has no spaces. Otherwise, the code would need to read the entire line. If the input string can have spaces, then using fgets would be better, but the Python code uses input(). So assuming the string is read correctly with scanf.\n\nAnother possible issue is buffer size. In the code, the buffer is 100001 characters. So the maximum string length is 100000, which is reasonable for programming problems.\n\nSo the translated code should be as above."
