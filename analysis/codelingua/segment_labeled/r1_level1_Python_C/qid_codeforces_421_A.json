So perhaps the input is such that each line is read as a whole.\n\nBut in practice, when using scanf with %d, it skips any whitespace, including newlines. So if the input is given as, for example:\n\n3 2 1\n\n1 3\n\n2\n\nThen the first scanf reads 3, 2, 1. Then the next a=2 numbers are read from the next line (1 and 3), then the next b=1 number (2) from the next line.\n\nSo using a loop to read a numbers into lista, then a loop to read b numbers into listb (even though we don't use them).\n\nSo in code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, a, b;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n    \n    int *lista = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &lista[i]);\n    }\n    \n    // Read listb but ignore it\n    int *listb = (int*)malloc(b * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &listb[i]);\n    }\n    free(listb); // since we don't use it\n    \n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        int found = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n            if (lista[i] == k) {\n                found = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (found) {\n            printf(\"1 \");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"2 \");\n        }\n    }\n    \n    free(lista);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in Python, the code uses k in range(n), which is 0-based up to n-1, so k+1 is from 1 to n. So in C, loop k from 1 to n, which matches.\n\nBut what about the output? The Python code uses end=\" \" to print a space after each number. In C, each printf(\"1 \") adds a space, so the output is numbers separated by spaces, and ends with a space. But in some cases, the trailing space may not be desired, but the original code in Python has a trailing space. So the C code should do the same.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says to translate the code, so the C code should replicate the output exactly. So the code will have a trailing space, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, handling memory: since the code uses malloc for lista and listb, we should free them. But listb is read and then immediately freed, since we don't use it. But in C, the code for listb is necessary to read the input, even though it's not used. So the code reads the listb into an array and then frees it.\n\nAlternatively, since we don't need to store listb, perhaps we can just read and discard the numbers. For example, instead of storing them in an array, read each number and ignore it. This would save memory. So for listb:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n    int temp;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n}\n\nThis way, we don't need to allocate memory for listb.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n// Read listb and ignore\nfor (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n    int temp;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n}\n\nThis is better, as it doesn't allocate memory for listb. So the code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, a, b;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n    \n    int *lista = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &lista[i]);\n    }\n    \n    // Read and discard listb\n    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n        int temp;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n    }\n    \n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        int found = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n            if (lista[i] == k) {\n                found = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d \", found ? 1 : 2);\n    }\n    \n    free(lista);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis way, we avoid allocating memory for listb, which is better.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: what if the same number appears multiple times in lista? But in Python, checking if k+1 is in lista would return true if it's present once or multiple times. The C code checks for any occurrence, so it's the same.\n\nAnother edge case: n could be 0? But according to the code, since the first line is n, a, b, and the code loops for k in range(n), which is 0 to n-1. So if n is 0, the loop doesn't run. So in C, if n is 0, the loop from 1 to n (which is 0) also doesn't run. So that's handled.\n\nAlso, the code uses a for the size of lista. So if the user inputs a different number of elements, but in the original code, they use a and b to split the input lines. So in C, the code reads exactly a elements for lista and b for listb.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nSo the final code is as written above."
