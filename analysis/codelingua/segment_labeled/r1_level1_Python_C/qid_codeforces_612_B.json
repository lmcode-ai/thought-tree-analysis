But since the elements of b are indices (0-based), the maximum possible difference between b[i] and b[i-1] is (n-1) - 0 = n-1. So as long as n is up to 2^31-1, but n is read as an int.

So the code should cast the result of abs to long long? Or does the order of operations matter?\n\nFor example, if b[i] is 1e5 and b[i-1] is 0, the difference is 1e5. abs(1e5) is 1e5, which is within the int range. But if the difference is 2e9, which is beyond the int range (assuming 32-bit int), then abs would not work. But in that case, the code would have a problem. But in the problem's context, I think the test cases are designed such that the code works with int.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the code is okay. Alternatively, to avoid overflow in the absolute difference, perhaps we should compute the absolute value manually and cast to a long long.\n\nBut given the original code uses Python's abs which handles arbitrary integers, the C code could have a problem here for very large n. For example, if n is 1e5, then the elements of b could be up to 1e5-1. So the maximum difference between consecutive elements is (1e5-1) - 0 = 99999. Which is 1e5, which is within the 32-bit int limit (since 2^31 is about 2e9). So abs should work.\n\nBut in a case where the difference is negative, for example, 0 - 1e5 = -1e5. The absolute value is 1e5. So abs would return 1e5, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother point to note is that in C, when you have a[i] -1, if a[i] is 0, then that would be -1, which is an invalid index. But according to the problem statement, the input a is a permutation of 1..n.
