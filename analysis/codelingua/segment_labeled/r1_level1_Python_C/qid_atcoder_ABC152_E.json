  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does.\n\nFirst, the code uses the fractions module's gcd function. Then there's a function lcm which computes the least common multiple using the formula a*b divided by gcd(a, b). But in the main part, the code calculates the LCM of all elements in the list A. Then it calculates the sum of the modular inverses of each element in A modulo MOD, multiplies that sum by the LCM, and takes the result modulo MOD again.\n\nWait, the key steps here are:\n\n1. Compute LCM of all elements in A.\n2. Compute the sum of 1/a_i modulo MOD for each a_i. But since division in modular arithmetic is multiplication by the modular inverse, each term is pow(a_i, MOD-2, MOD) because MOD is a prime (since 10^9+7 is a prime number).\n3. Multiply the LCM by this sum and take modulo MOD.\n\nSo the challenge is to replicate this logic in C. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in C, there's no built-in gcd function, so I need to implement that. The Python code uses the fractions.gcd, which I think computes the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm. So I'll need to write a gcd function in C.\n\nThen, the LCM computation. The LCM of a list of numbers is computed by iteratively computing the LCM of the current LCM and the next element. So for each a in A, _lcm = lcm(_lcm, a). But in the code, the initial LCM is 1. Then for each a, it's updated as (_lcm * a) // gcd(_lcm, a). So I need to compute that step by step.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code uses integer division with //. But in C, when you divide two integers, it truncates towards zero. However, since we are multiplying _lcm and a and then dividing by their GCD, which should divide the product exactly, the result will be an integer. So in C, as long as the division is done correctly, it's okay. So the order of operations matters. Let's make sure that in C, we multiply first and then divide by the GCD. But since the product of _lcm and a could be very large (given that A could have numbers up to 1e9, and N is up to however long the input is), there's a risk of overflow. Wait, the original code in Python uses arbitrary-precision integers, so it can handle large numbers. But in C, using 64-bit integers (like long long) is necessary.\n\nSo, variables should be of type long long to handle large numbers. But even then, multiplying two large numbers could overflow. Wait, let's think: the LCM is being computed for all elements in the array. Let's say the array elements are up to 1e9. For example, if the array has 1e5 elements each being 1e9, then the LCM could be extremely large, which would not fit into a 64-bit integer. But the original Python code uses arbitrary precision, so in the C code, perhaps there's a problem here. However, looking at the problem's constraints, maybe N isn't too big. But the user hasn't specified constraints. But the problem uses MOD = 1e9+7, and the final answer is (LCM * sum_inv) mod MOD. So perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this without calculating the actual LCM, but instead using properties of modular arithmetic. But the original code doesn't do that. It first computes the LCM as an integer, then multiplies by the sum of inverses mod MOD. But if the LCM is very large, then multiplying by the sum mod MOD would require the LCM mod MOD. Wait, because (a * b) mod MOD = ((a mod MOD) * (b mod MOD)) mod MOD. So perhaps we can compute the LCM modulo MOD. But wait, the LCM is a product of primes in their maximum exponents from the array. However, when we multiply the LCM (mod MOD) by the sum of inverses (mod MOD), that's equivalent to the original code's approach. But in the original code, the LCM is computed as a very large number, but then multiplied by the sum, and the product is taken mod MOD. So if the LCM is larger than MOD, the actual value of LCM mod MOD is what's needed. So perhaps in the C code, we can compute the LCM modulo MOD, which would avoid dealing with very large numbers. But is that possible?\n\nWait, let's see. The problem is that the LCM is being multiplied by the sum of 1/a_i mod MOD, and then the product is taken mod MOD. So LCM mod MOD multiplied by sum_inv mod MOD would give the same result as (LCM * sum_inv) mod MOD. Therefore, even if LCM is very large, we can compute LCM mod MOD first, then multiply by sum_inv mod MOD, and take mod MOD again. That's correct. So this would allow us to avoid dealing with large LCM values. But how do we compute the LCM modulo MOD?\n\nBut wait, the LCM is the product of primes in their maximum exponents. For example, if a number in the array has a prime factor p^k, and the current LCM has p^m, then we take p^max(k,m). So the LCM is the product of these primes. However, when we compute LCM mod MOD, since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, if the LCM includes MOD as a factor, then LCM mod MOD would be zero. But in that case, the entire product would be zero. But how does that affect the original code's output?\n\nWait, but MOD is 1e9+7. If any a_i in the array is a multiple of MOD, then in the sum of inverses, 1/a_i mod MOD would be undefined (since a_i and MOD are not coprime). But MOD is a prime, so a_i must not be a multiple of MOD for the inverse to exist. But the problem statement probably assumes that all a_i are coprime with MOD. Otherwise, the code would fail. So perhaps the input ensures that all a_i are not multiples of MOD. Therefore, when calculating the LCM, if any a_i is a multiple of MOD, then LCM would be a multiple of MOD, but that's only possible if a_i is a multiple of MOD. But in that case, the inverse 1/a_i mod MOD would not exist. So the problem must have constraints that a_i and MOD are coprimes, which makes sense because MOD is a prime, so a_i must not be multiples of MOD.\n\nTherefore, the LCM can't be a multiple of MOD. Because all a_i are coprime with MOD. Wait, not exactly. Because LCM is the product of primes in their maximum exponents from the a_i. If any a_i contains a prime factor that is MOD, then that a_i is a multiple of MOD, which is 1e9+7, but since a_i is up to what? The input is given as N numbers. But the code's original approach would fail if any a_i is a multiple of MOD. So the problem must ensure that this is not the case.\n\nBut given that, the LCM can be computed modulo MOD, since MOD is a prime, and since the LCM's factors do not include MOD. Therefore, the LCM and MOD are coprimes. Wait, no. For example, if a_i is 2, then the LCM could have 2 as a factor. But MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and 2 is not a factor of MOD. So the LCM and MOD are coprimes. Because all a_i are coprimes with MOD (since their inverses exist), which means that each a_i's prime factors are not MOD. Therefore, the LCM's prime factors also cannot be MOD. Therefore, the LCM and MOD are coprimes. Therefore, the LCM mod MOD is not zero, and (LCM mod MOD) is invertible mod MOD.\n\nTherefore, the product (LCM * sum_inv) mod MOD can be calculated as ( (LCM mod MOD) * (sum_inv mod MOD) ) mod MOD. So this suggests that instead of computing the actual LCM (which may be huge), we can compute the LCM mod MOD. Because LCM mod MOD multiplied by sum_inv mod MOD gives the same result as the original code.\n\nSo this is a key insight. Therefore, in the C code, we can compute the LCM modulo MOD, which prevents overflow issues. Because even with 64-bit integers, if the LCM is very large (like 1e200), the code would overflow. But by computing it modulo MOD, we can manage.\n\nSo how to compute LCM modulo MOD?\n\nThe LCM of two numbers can be computed as (a * b) / gcd(a, b). But when we compute this modulo MOD, we can't directly do (a*b) mod MOD divided by gcd(a,b). But since the LCM modulo MOD is equal to ( (a mod MOD) * (b mod MOD) * inv(gcd(a,b)) ) mod MOD. Wait, but this approach is possible only if we can compute the inverse of the gcd.\n\nWait, but the LCM is (a * b) / gcd(a, b). So in modulo arithmetic, division by d is multiplication by the inverse of d modulo MOD, provided that d and MOD are coprimes. But in this case, d is the gcd(a, b). But since a and MOD are coprimes (as per problem's assumptions), and b and MOD are coprimes, then the gcd(a, b) and MOD must be coprime. Because a and MOD are coprime, and b and MOD are coprimes. So the gcd(a, b) can't have any factors in common with MOD (since MOD is prime). Because a and MOD are coprimes, their gcd is 1. Similarly for b. So the gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, but since a and b are coprimes with MOD, the gcd(a, b) must also be coprime with MOD. Therefore, the inverse of gcd(a, b) modulo MOD exists.\n\nTherefore, to compute LCM mod MOD, for two numbers a and b, it's ( (a mod MOD) * (b mod MOD) * inv_gcd ) % MOD, where inv_gcd is the modular inverse of gcd(a, b) modulo MOD.\n\nBut wait, let me check this:\n\nSuppose a and b are two numbers, and their gcd is g. Then, LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / g. So modulo MOD, this is equivalent to (a * b * inv(g)) mod MOD. But since a and b are computed modulo MOD, and inv(g) is the inverse of g modulo MOD.\n\nSo when building the LCM for the array, each step would compute the LCM of the current result and the next a_i. So in the code, instead of keeping track of the actual LCM (which could be very large), we keep track of LCM mod MOD. Then, for each a_i in the array, the new LCM mod MOD is ( (current_lcm * a_i) * inv(gcd(current_lcm_actual, a_i)) ) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but current_lcm_actual is the actual LCM up to that point, not mod MOD. Because when we compute the GCD of current_lcm_actual and a_i, the GCD depends on their actual values, not their mod MOD values. So this approach may not work. Because the GCD is computed based on the actual values, not the mod MOD values.\n\nAh, here's the problem. If we compute current_lcm as (current_lcm * a_i) // gcd(current_lcm, a_i), but in the mod MOD approach, we can't track the actual LCM. Because the GCD depends on the actual values, not their mod MOD values. Therefore, if we track the LCM modulo MOD, we can't compute the GCD of the actual LCM and a_i. Therefore, this approach is not feasible. So this complicates things.\n\nSo, in the original Python code, the LCM is computed as a very large integer, which could be up to (1e9)^(1e5), which is way beyond what a 64-bit integer can hold. So in C, we can't compute that. Therefore, the code would overflow and give incorrect results. So the original approach is not feasible in C for large N or large a_i. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that the LCM is computed normally, but with handling of possible overflows. But how?\n\nWait, but the user provided the code and wants it translated to C. So the code may be correct under the problem's constraints, but how to handle the LCM calculation in C. Let's see. Let's think about the variables. In Python, integers are arbitrary-precision, so multiplying large numbers isn't a problem. In C, we can use 64-bit integers (long long), but even that may not be enough. For example, if the LCM is 1e9 multiplied by 1e9 (for N=2), that's 1e18, which is within the range of a 64-bit integer (which can hold up to 9e18). But if N is larger, say 10 elements each of 1e9, then the LCM could be 1e90, which is way beyond 64 bits. So this would overflow and produce incorrect intermediate values. Therefore, the original code's approach cannot be directly translated into C for larger inputs. So perhaps the problem has constraints that the LCM doesn't overflow 64 bits? Or is there a smarter way?\n\nBut the user hasn't given any constraints. So the answer must be to translate the code as directly as possible, using 64-bit integers where possible, but the code would fail for large inputs. Alternatively, find a mathematical approach to compute the result without calculating the full LCM.\n\nBut the problem's final answer is (LCM * sum_inv) mod MOD. Let's see if we can find a way to compute this without calculating LCM directly. Let's denote LCM as L. Then the sum_inv is sum(1/a_i mod MOD). Then the answer is (L * sum_inv) mod MOD.\n\nBut L is the LCM of all a_i. How to express this in terms that can be computed modulo MOD?\n\nEach term in the sum_inv is 1/a_i mod MOD. So sum_inv mod MOD is the sum of (1/a_i mod MOD) for all i. Then L mod MOD multiplied by this sum mod MOD, then mod MOD again gives the answer. But how to compute L mod MOD when L is the LCM of the a_i's.\n\nBut since all a_i are coprime with MOD (as their inverses exist), their LCM is also coprime with MOD. Because LCM is the product of the maximum exponents of primes in each a_i. Since none of those primes are MOD, then LCM and MOD are coprimes. Therefore, L mod MOD is non-zero and invertible. So, how to compute L mod MOD?\n\nBut again, L is the product of the primes to their maximum exponents. So, for each prime in the factorization of the a_i's, we take the maximum exponent. Then multiply them all together. So the LCM mod MOD can be computed by taking each a_i, factorizing it into primes, track the maximum exponent for each prime, then multiply all primes^max_exponent mod MOD. But factorizing each a_i may be time-consuming. But given that the constraints are not given, perhaps the original code's approach is acceptable for the problem's intended input size. Therefore, the code can be translated to C using 64-bit integers, and the user may accept that it works for small LCMs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has N small enough that the LCM can fit into a 64-bit integer. For example, if each a_i is up to 1e4 and N is up to 20, then LCM could be up to (1e4)^20, which is way larger than 1e64. So it's impossible.\n\nThus, the original approach is not feasible in C for large inputs. So perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think again: the answer is (L * sum_{i}(1/a_i)) mod MOD. Let's express this as sum_{i} (L / a_i) mod MOD. Because L is divisible by each a_i. So L / a_i is an integer. So the sum is sum_{i} (L / a_i) mod MOD. Then the total is sum_{i} ( (L mod MOD) * (1/a_i mod MOD) ) mod MOD. Because (L/a_i) mod MOD is equal to (L mod MOD) * (1/a_i mod MOD) mod MOD.\n\nBut since L is divisible by a_i, (L/a_i) is an integer, but how does that affect the modulo operation? It's possible because L is divisible by a_i, which is coprimes with MOD, so L/a_i is also coprimes with MOD? Not necessarily, but since MOD is a prime, and a_i is coprime with MOD, and L is the LCM, which is a multiple of a_i. So L/a_i is an integer, and L is coprimes with MOD. Therefore, L/a_i is also coprimes with MOD. Because L is product of primes not including MOD, and a_i is a product of some of those primes. So dividing L by a_i gives a product of other primes, none of which is MOD. Therefore, L/a_i is coprimes with MOD. So (L/a_i) mod MOD is equal to (L mod MOD) * (1/a_i mod MOD) mod MOD. Therefore, the sum can be computed as sum over i of ( (L mod MOD) * inv_a_i ) mod MOD, which is L mod MOD multiplied by sum(inv_a_i) mod MOD, then mod MOD. Which is exactly what the original code does. So the original approach is correct.\n\nBut then, how to compute L mod MOD without computing L directly. Because L can be very large. So the problem is how to compute L mod MOD given that each a_i is coprimes with MOD.\n\nBut wait, since L is the product of primes in their maximum exponents, and each a_i is coprimes with MOD, the primes in L's factorization are all coprimes with MOD. So, L mod MOD is equal to the product of (each prime^exponent) mod MOD. So, to compute L mod MOD, we can factorize each a_i into primes, track the maximum exponent of each prime, then compute the product of (prime^max_exp) mod MOD for all primes in the factorization.\n\nThis approach would avoid computing L directly, thus preventing overflow. But factorizing each a_i may be time-consuming. However, if the a_i's are up to 1e9, then trial division up to sqrt(n) is feasible for each a_i. For example, factorizing 1e9 takes up to 3e4 steps (since sqrt(1e9) is 3e4). But if N is up to 1e5, then this would take 1e5 * 3e4 = 3e9 operations, which is way too slow. So this approach is not feasible for large N.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible way is to compute LCM mod MOD by using the iterative approach, but compute each step's LCM mod MOD. But as discussed earlier, the problem is that to compute the GCD between the current LCM (mod MOD not considered) and a_i, which requires knowing the actual current LCM.\n\nBut wait, how can we compute the GCD of the current LCM (which is a product of previous a_j's divided by their GCDs) and the current a_i? Because the actual LCM could be very large, but the GCD(a, b) depends on the actual values of a and b.\n\nSo, unless there's a mathematical way to compute the GCD of the current LCM and a_i, given the LCM mod MOD, which is not possible, we have to find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's intended solution is to compute the LCM modulo MOD using the fact that the LCM is the product of primes in their maximum exponents. But this requires factorizing each a_i and tracking the maximum exponents. But this would require a factorization step for each a_i.\n\nAlternatively, can we compute LCM mod MOD using the formula LCM(a, b) mod MOD = (a * b * inv(gcd(a, b))) mod MOD. But since a and b here are the current LCM mod MOD and the next a_i mod MOD, but then the GCD is computed of the current LCM (not mod MOD) and a_i. But this is not possible.\n\nHmm, this seems like a dead end. Therefore, the original approach, which works in Python with arbitrary-precision integers, can't be directly translated to C for large inputs. But perhaps the user's test cases are small enough that the LCM can fit into a 64-bit integer. So proceed with the translation, using 64-bit integers and a gcd function, but note that overflow may occur for large inputs.\n\nSo, steps for translation:\n\n1. Implement a GCD function in C. The Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Read N, then read the array A.\n\n3. Compute the LCM of all elements in A. Initialize lcm as 1. For each a in A, compute the GCD of current lcm and a, then lcm = (lcm * a) / gcd. Must use 64-bit integers (long long) to handle large numbers. But since the product lcm * a may overflow even 64 bits, we need to check for overflow. But in C, there's no built-in check for overflow. So this code will work for inputs where the LCM doesn't exceed 64 bits. For larger inputs, this will produce incorrect results.\n\n4. Compute the sum of the modular inverses of each a_i. For each a_i, compute pow(a_i, MOD-2) mod MOD. Sum these values modulo MOD.\n\n5. Multiply the LCM by this sum, mod MOD.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of modular inverses? In C, the pow function can be used with modular exponentiation. Since MOD is a prime, the inverse of a_i is a_i^(MOD-2) mod MOD. But in C, we need to implement a modular exponentiation function.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Implement GCD function.\n\n- Implement modular exponentiation function for calculating inv_a_i = pow_mod(a_i, MOD-2, MOD).\n\n- Compute LCM.\n\n- Compute sum of inv_a_i mod MOD.\n\n- Multiply LCM mod MOD by sum mod MOD, then mod MOD again.\n\nBut again, the LCM can overflow 64 bits. For example, if the LCM is larger than 1e18, then storing it in a long long (which is typically 64 bits, can hold up to 9e18) may be possible. But for N=30, each a_i is 1e9, then LCM is 1e9^30, which is way too big.\n\nBut given that the user wants a translation of the Python code, perhaps they are aware of the limitations and assume that inputs will not cause overflow. So proceed.\n\nSo, writing the code:\n\nFirst, include necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nDefine MOD as 1e9+7:\n\n#define MOD 1000000007LL\n\nThen, implement GCD:\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long long temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nThen, implement modular exponentiation:\n\nlong long pow_mod(long long base, long long exponent, long long mod) {\n    long long result = 1;\n    base = base % mod;\n    while (exponent > 0) {\n        if (exponent % 2 == 1) {\n            result = (result * base) % mod;\n        }\n        exponent = exponent >> 1;\n        base = (base * base) % mod;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThen, read N and the array A:\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    long long *A = (long long *)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &A[i]);\n    }\n\n    long long current_lcm = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        long long g = gcd(current_lcm, A[i]);\n        current_lcm = current_lcm / g * A[i];\n        // To avoid overflow, check if current_lcm exceeds (1e18) or something, but not possible here.\n        // However, if current_lcm exceeds LLONG_MAX (9e18), this will overflow.\n        // So this is a potential problem.\n    }\n\n    long long sum_inv = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        sum_inv = (sum_inv + pow_mod(A[i], MOD-2, MOD)) % MOD;\n    }\n\n    long long ans = (current_lcm % MOD) * (sum_inv % MOD) % MOD;\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n    free(A);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut the problem is that current_lcm may overflow during computation, leading to incorrect results. For example, when multiplying current_lcm by A[i], even if divided by g, the product current_lcm * A[i] might exceed 64 bits before division. For example, current_lcm is 1e18, A[i] is 1e9, then 1e18 * 1e9 = 1e27, which is way larger than 9e18 (LLONG_MAX is 9223372036854775807 for a 64-bit signed integer). So this would cause overflow and undefined behavior.\n\nSo, in such cases, the code will produce incorrect LCM values, leading to wrong answers. But the original Python code doesn't have this problem. Therefore, the translated code will work correctly only when the LCM fits into a 64-bit integer.\n\nGiven that, but the user asked for a translation, the code is correct as per the problem's logic, but has limitations due to integer overflow.\n\nSo this is the best possible translation under the circumstances."
