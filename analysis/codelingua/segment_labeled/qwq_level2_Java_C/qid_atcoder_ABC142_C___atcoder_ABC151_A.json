  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC142_C. It reads an integer N, then for N numbers, it stores their positions in a map where the key is the number and the value is its index (1-based). Then it prints out the values of the map in order from key 1 to N. So essentially, for each position i from 1 to N, it finds which original number A had that position, and outputs the index where A was found. Wait, no, actually, the map is storing A as the key and the index (i) as the value. So when you loop from 1 to N for the keys, you get the index (i) that was stored for each A. Wait, maybe I should think of it as: For each input A (the numbers given in order), the map records that A's position is i. Then, when you iterate over keys 1 to N, you get the i's in the order of the keys. So the output is the list of indices where the numbers 1, 2, ..., N were found in the input. So for example, if the input is like N=3 and the A's are 3,1,2, then the map would have 3\u21921, 1\u21922, 2\u21923. So when you loop keys 1,2,3, you get 2,3,1. So the output is 2 3 1. So the first program takes a list of numbers and outputs the permutation that maps each number to its position in the input.\n\nThe second Java program is atcoder_ABC151_A. It reads a string, then outputs the first character plus 1. Wait, but in Java, characters are treated as their ASCII values. So if the input is \"a\", then the first character is 'a' (ASCII 97), adding 1 gives 98 which is 'b', so output is 'b'. But if the input is \"z\", then it would output '{' (ASCII 123). Wait, but maybe the problem expects something else? The code here is straightforward: take the first character of the input string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and print that character. The rest of the code in the second file includes a class RemRing which isn't used here. So the second program only uses the first character of the input and outputs the next character.\n\nNow, the problem says that the two Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of the first is the input to the second. So the C program must read the original input (for the first Java program), process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second step.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (N followed by N integers).\n2. Process the first step (map the numbers to their indices and output the permutation as space-separated numbers).\n3. Then, take that permutation string as input to the second step (which is just taking the first character and adding 1).\n4. Finally, output the result of the second step.\n\nBut since we have to do this in a single C program without intermediate I/O, except for the first read and last output, the steps must be done in memory.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read N and the list of A's (the input for the first Java program).\n- Compute the permutation as in the first Java program, storing it as an array or a string.\n- Then, take that permutation's first character (the first number's first digit?), wait no. Wait, the first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. The second program reads that entire output as a string, then takes the first character of that string and increments it. Wait, but the first program's output is a space-separated list. For example, if the output is \"2 3 1\", then the second program's input is that string. The first character is '2', so adding 1 would give '3', so the output is '3'.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is read via BufferedReader.readLine(), which reads the entire line. So the first program's output is a line of space-separated integers, which is the input to the second program. So the second program takes that entire line, takes the first character (the first character of the first number), adds 1, and outputs that.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after processing the first step, we need to generate the string that would be the output of the first Java program, then process that string through the second step's logic.\n\nSo steps in C:\n\n1. Read N and the list of A's (the input for the first Java program).\n2. Create an array (or list) that for each position 1..N, stores the index where that number was found in the input. For example, for each i from 1 to N, find the position (original index) where A was equal to i. Wait, no. Wait, in the first Java program, the map is built by putting A (the input number) as the key, and the index (i) as the value. So for each key from 1 to N, the value is the index where that key was found in the input. So the output is the list of values for keys 1,2,...,N. So for each i from 1 to N, the value is the index (starting at 1) where the input had the number i. So the first step's output is the list of indices where each number 1..N appeared in the input.\n\nSo in C, to do this:\n\n- Read N, then read N integers into an array A of size N (indexes 0 to N-1, but the original Java uses 1-based, so maybe adjust for that).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 1 to N, so the first element is stored at i=1, which would be index 0 in a 0-based array. So in C, perhaps we can use a 1-based array by using an array of size N+1, with indices 1 to N.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint N;\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\nint A[N+1]; // indexes 1..N\nfor (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n}\n\nWait, but the input is N followed by N numbers. So the first number after N is A[1], then A[2], etc.\n\nThen, we need to create an array (or a list) that for each number from 1 to N, gives the index where it was found. So for each number x in 1..N, find the i where A[i] == x, then store that i in a result array.\n\nWait, exactly. So for each x from 1 to N, the position is the i where A[i] is x. So we can create an array pos of size N+1 (indexes 1..N), where pos[x] = i where A[i] = x.\n\nSo:\n\nint pos[N+1]; // pos[1..N]\n\nfor (int x=1; x<=N; x++) {\n    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {\n        if (A[i] == x) {\n            pos[x] = i;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this is O(N^2), which might be okay for small N, but in Java's code, they used a HashMap, which is O(N) time. Since in C, we can do this with a single pass. Let's see:\n\nWait, in the Java code, they loop through each i from 1 to N, and for each, they put A (the value) as the key, and i as the value. So for each A[i], the key is A[i], and the value is i. So after all entries are added, for each key from 1 to N, the value is the i where A[i] was that key. So in C, we can do this with an array. Let's see:\n\nInitialize an array pos of size N+1 (indexes 1..N) to 0 or something. Then, for each i from 1 to N:\n\npos[A[i]] = i;\n\nBecause for each A[i], which is the value, we set pos[A[i]] to the current i. Since all A[i] are unique (since they are 1-based up to N?), assuming that the input is a permutation. Wait, the problem probably assumes that the input is a permutation of 1..N, since otherwise the code would have some undefined behavior. Because in the Java code, when you loop from 1 to N, you get the keys, but if some key isn't present, then get would return null, but in the code, it's printed as a number. So the problem must assume that the input is a permutation. So in C, we can safely do this.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nInitialize pos array to 0, then for each i from 1 to N:\n\npos[A[i]] = i;\n\nThen, the output is the list pos[1], pos[2], ..., pos[N], separated by spaces.\n\nSo that's the first step.\n\nOnce we have that array, we need to generate the string that would be the output of the first Java program. That is, the space-separated list of pos[1], pos[2], ..., pos[N].\n\nThen, the second step is to take that string, take its first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nSo in C, after computing the pos array, we need to create a string (or a buffer) that contains the numbers separated by spaces. Then, take the first character of that string, add 1, and print it.\n\nBut how to handle the string in C?\n\nWe can compute the required string as a character array. Let's see:\n\nFirst, determine the maximum possible length of the output string. Each number can be up to N digits. Let's say N is up to 1e5, but in practice, the problem might have constraints. But for the code, perhaps we can compute the required length dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the string step by step, appending each number with a space, then trimming the last space.\n\nAlternatively, since the numbers are printed with spaces between them, the first character is the first digit of the first number in the list.\n\nWait, the first number in the list is pos[1], which is the index where the number 1 was found in the input. So the first character of the output string is the first digit of that number.\n\nSo for example, if pos[1] is 12, then the first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nSo the key is to get the first character of the first number in the pos array's output.\n\nWait, but the output of the first program is the list of numbers separated by spaces. So the first character is the first digit of the first number. So the second program's input is that entire string, and it takes the first character of that string (the first character of the first number), adds 1, and outputs that.\n\nTherefore, in C, after computing the first step's result (the pos array), we can compute the first number (pos[1]), then get its first character's ASCII value, add 1, and output that.\n\nWait, but how do we get the first character of the first number's string representation?\n\nAh, right. The first number is pos[1], which is an integer. We need to convert it to a string, take the first character, then process it.\n\nSo steps in C:\n\n1. Compute pos array as above.\n\n2. Convert pos[1] to a string. The first character of this string is the first character of the first number in the output of the first program.\n\n3. Take that first character, add 1, and output it.\n\nTherefore, we don't need to build the entire string, just the first number's first character.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight! Because the second program only uses the first character of the entire input string, which is the first character of the first number in the first program's output. So we can avoid building the entire string and just compute the first character of the first number (pos[1]).\n\nSo how to get the first character of the first number (pos[1])?\n\nWe can convert the integer pos[1] to a string, then take the first character.\n\nIn C, to do that, we can use sprintf to write the number into a buffer, then take the first character.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the first digit by repeatedly dividing by 10 until we get to the first digit.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nLet's say the first number is x = pos[1].\n\nWe need to find the first digit of x when written in decimal.\n\nFor example, x=123 \u2192 first digit is '1', x=5 \u2192 '5', x=0 (but since it's 1-based, x can't be 0).\n\nWait, since pos is built from the input which is a permutation, pos[1] is between 1 and N, so it's at least 1.\n\nSo to get the first digit:\n\nWe can loop dividing by 10 until the number is less than 10, but that would give the last digit. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, to get the first digit, we can find the highest power of 10 that is less than or equal to x.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert the number to a string and take the first character.\n\nIn C, the easiest way is to use sprintf to write the number into a buffer, then take the first character.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nint first_num = pos[1];\n\nchar buffer[20]; // enough for numbers up to 1e18, but N is up to maybe 1e5, so 6 digits.\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%d\", first_num);\n\nchar first_char = buffer[0];\n\nThen, the result is first_char + 1. But we have to handle the case where it's a digit, but adding 1 could go beyond '9', but the second Java program just adds 1 to the ASCII value, so even if it's a letter, it would proceed. For example, if the first character is '9', adding 1 gives ':', which is what the Java code would do.\n\nSo in C, the final output is putchar(first_char + 1); or printf(\"%c\", first_char + 1);\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe steps in C:\n\nRead N, read N numbers into A[1..N].\n\nCompute pos array where pos[A[i]] = i for each i from 1 to N.\n\nThen, get first_num = pos[1].\n\nConvert first_num to a string, get first character.\n\nOutput that character +1.\n\nWait, but what if the first number is a multi-digit number? Like 12 \u2192 first character is '1', so adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int A[N+1]; // 1-based\n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n    }\n\n    int pos[N+1]; // pos[1..N]\n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n        pos[A[i]] = i;\n    }\n\n    int first_num = pos[1];\n    char buffer[20];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", first_num);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", first_char + 1);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the output is printed with spaces between the numbers, but the second program reads the entire line. However, the first program's output is a space-separated list. So the actual first character is the first digit of the first number, which is exactly what we are capturing here. The spaces between numbers don't affect the first character, since the first number's digits come first.\n\nYes, that's correct. So this code should work.\n\nWait, but what if the first number is 0? But since the input is a permutation of 1..N, pos[1] is between 1 and N, so it can't be 0. So no problem.\n\nTesting with the example I thought of earlier:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput for first Java program:\n\n3\n\n3 1 2\n\nThen A[1] =3, A[2]=1, A[3]=2.\n\npos[3] =1, pos[1]=2, pos[2]=3.\n\nSo pos[1] is 2. The first number is 2. The first character is '2', so adding 1 gives '3', which is the output.\n\nWhich matches the second program's processing.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput N=1, then the A is 1. So pos[1] =1. The first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nAnother case where the first number is 10:\n\nSuppose N=10, and the first number in the output is 10. Then the first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where the first number is 9, then output is '9' +1 \u2192 ':'.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the C code should be as above.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the output is printed with a space at the end? Let me see:\n\nIn the first Java program's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n    System.out.print(idorder.get(i));\n    System.out.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo after the last element, there's a space. So the output is like \"2 3 1 \" (with a trailing space). But the second Java program reads the entire line, including the trailing space. However, the first character is still the first digit of the first number. The trailing space doesn't affect the first character.\n\nSo the code in C is correct because even if there's a trailing space, the first character is still the first digit of the first number.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, let me check the code again for possible issues.\n\nWait, in the code, the array A is declared as int A[N+1], which is okay in C99, but in some older standards, variable-length arrays might not be allowed. However, given that the problem is about code translation, and assuming that the code can use C99 features, it's acceptable. Alternatively, if needed, we can use malloc, but for the problem's scope, the code as written should be okay.\n\nAnother point: the pos array is initialized? No, in the code above, the pos array is not initialized. So when we do pos[A[i]] = i, but for other entries, they might have garbage. However, since we are only accessing pos[1], which is set because the input is a permutation (so A[i] covers all 1..N), so pos[1] will be set. The other entries in pos are irrelevant because the second program only uses the first number. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, the pos array is not initialized. So for example, if A[i] is 5, then pos[5] is set to i, but other entries (like pos[3] before processing A[i]=3) could have any value. But since we only need pos[1], which is set because the input is a permutation, it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nSo the final C code is as written above."
