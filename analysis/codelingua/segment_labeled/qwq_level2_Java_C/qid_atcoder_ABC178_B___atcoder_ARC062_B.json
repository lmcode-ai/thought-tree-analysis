The main method reads four long integers, stores them in an array a, and then calculates the maximum of a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], and a[1]*a[2]. Then it prints that maximum value. So the output of this first program is the maximum of those four products.\n\nThe second Java file is atcoder_ARC062_B. Its main method reads a string S, then processes each character. For each position i, if i is even, the expected character is 'g', else 'p'. If the actual character doesn't match, the score is adjusted: adding 1 if the expected was 'p' (so the actual was 'g'?), or subtracting 1 if expected was 'g' (so actual was 'p'). Wait, let me check the code again. The code says: my is 'g' when i is even, 'p' when odd. If my != his (the actual character), then if my was 'p', add 1, else subtract 1. Wait, so when my is 'g' (even index), and the actual is not 'g', then my is 'g', so the condition is my != his, so the code adds -1? Because the code says: if my is 'p', add 1, else (my is 'g') subtract 1. Hmm, so the score is calculated based on mismatches. Let me see:\n\nFor each character in S:\n\n- If the position is even (0-based?), then expected is 'g'. If the actual is not 'g', then my is 'g', so the code adds -1 (because my is 'g', so the second part is -1). Wait, no: the code says:\n\nif (my != his) { score += (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1); }\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even i), and his is not equal to my, then the contribution is -1. So that's a penalty. But when my is 'p' (odd i), and his is not equal to 'p', then contribution is +1. So the total score is the number of times the actual character was different from the expected, but with different signs depending on the expected character.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the user is supposed to choose 'g' or 'p' based on the position, and the opponent chooses the actual character. The score is calculated as the difference between the user's wins and losses? Not sure, but the code is straightforward.\n\nThe second program takes the output of the first program as input? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. Wait, but the first program's output is a number (the maximum product), and the second program expects a string S as input. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem setup here. Wait, the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string S. So the first program's output must be a string that the second program can read as S. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so when you run them in sequence, the second program would read that number as its input S. But the second program's code expects S to be a string of characters (like a string of 'g's and 'p's?), but if the first program outputs a number, then the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234\", then the second program's S would be \"1234\", and process each character as '1', '2', etc. So the final C program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's input is four longs. The second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number (the maximum product), which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. So the second program's S is the string representation of the first program's output. So the C program must read the four numbers, compute the first step's output (the max product), then use that as the input to the second step's processing, then output the result of the second step.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read four long integers (as per the first Java program's input).\n2. Compute the maximum of the four products (as first step).\n3. Then, take that maximum value as the input string for the second step (i.e., convert it to a string, then process it as the S in the second Java program).\n4. Compute the score as per the second Java program's logic.\n5. Output that score.\n\nSo the C program must do all of this in one go, without any intermediate I/O except for the initial input and final output.\n\nNow, translating this into C.\n\nFirst, the first part: reading four longs. In C, since Java's long is 64 bits, but in C, we can use long long (which is 64 bits on most systems). So the first step is to read four long long integers from stdin.\n\nThen compute the maximum of a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], a[1]*a[2]. Since these are 64-bit numbers, but in C, multiplying two long longs can overflow, but the problem probably expects us to compute it as per the original code. The original Java code uses long, which is 64 bits, so in C, using long long (assuming 64 bits) is okay. So compute all four products, then take the maximum.\n\nThen, the second step: take that maximum value, convert it to a string, then process each character in that string as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a string S. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, becomes a string (like \"1234\"), and that is the input to the second program. So in the C program, after computing the max, we need to convert it to a string, then process each character in that string as the S for the second step.\n\nSo steps in C:\n\nRead four numbers a0, a1, a2, a3.\n\nCompute max_val = max of the four products.\n\nConvert max_val to a string (as a C string). Need to handle negative numbers? Well, the first Java program's output is a maximum of products of four longs. Since the problem is from a programming contest, perhaps the input ensures that the products are non-negative? Or maybe the max could be negative. But in any case, the code must handle it correctly. However, when converting to a string, the sign will be part of the string. For example, if the max is -5, then the string is \"-5\", so the characters are '-', '5'.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code processes each character in S. So if the first program's output is a negative number, then the second program's S would include the '-' as part of the string. So the C code must handle that.\n\nSo, first, compute the max_val, then convert it to a string. How to do that in C?\n\nUse sprintf to write the number into a buffer. For example:\n\nchar str[256];\nsprintf(str, \"%lld\", max_val);\n\nThen, process each character in str as the S string.\n\nThen, for each character in the string (each character in the array from str[0] to str[len-1], where len is strlen(str)), process each character as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second part's logic is:\n\nInitialize score to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in S (the string from the first step's output):\n\nfor each index i (starting at 0):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if i is even, 'p' if odd.\n\nif the current character (his_char) is not equal to my_char:\n\nthen, if my_char is 'p', add 1 to score.\n\nelse (my_char is 'g'), subtract 1 from score.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (my != his) {\n\n    score += (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1);\n\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even i), and his is not equal to 'g', then subtract 1.\n\nWhen my is 'p' (odd i), and his is not equal to 'p', add 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo in C, for each character in the string (including any '-' sign, digits, etc.), process each character in order.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nThe C program structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    long long a[4];\n    for (int i = 0; i <4; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    // compute max_val\n    long long p1 = a[0] * a[2];\n    long long p2 = a[1] * a[3];\n    long long p3 = a[0] * a[3];\n    long long p4 = a[1] * a[2];\n    long long max_val = p1;\n    if (p2 > max_val) max_val = p2;\n    if (p3 > max_val) max_val = p3;\n    if (p4 > max_val) max_val = p4;\n\n    // convert max_val to string\n    char str[256];\n    sprintf(str, \"%lld\", max_val);\n\n    // process the string as S\n    int score =0;\n    int len = strlen(str);\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n        char my;\n        if (i%2 ==0) my = 'g';\n        else my = 'p';\n        char his = str[i];\n        if (my != his) {\n            if (my == 'p') {\n                score +=1;\n            } else {\n                score -=1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", score);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but need to make sure that the string conversion is correct. For example, if the max_val is negative, the string will start with '-', so the first character is '-', which is part of the processing. The code above handles that correctly.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0. Then the string is \"0\", so length 1. The first character (i=0, even) is '0', my is 'g'. So '0' != 'g', so since my is 'g', subtract 1. So the score would be -1?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor S = \"0\":\n\ni=0 (even): my is 'g', his is '0'. They are different. Since my is 'g', so subtract 1. So score is -1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs \"1234\".\n\nThen the string is \"1234\", length 4.\n\ni=0 (even): my 'g', his '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\ni=1 (odd): my 'p', his '2' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0).\n\ni=2 (even): my 'g', his '3' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\ni=3 (odd): my 'p', his '4' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0).\n\nTotal score 0.\n\nHmm, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs \"-5\".\n\nThe string is \"-5\", length 2.\n\ni=0: my 'g', his '-'. Different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\ni=1: my 'p', his '5'. Different \u2192 add 1 (score 0).\n\nTotal 0.\n\nAnother case: the first program's output is \"gp\" (but that's not possible since it's a number, but just for testing the second part). Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so the string can only consist of digits and possibly a '-'.\n\nWait, but the second program's code in Java reads the entire next token as S. Wait, in the second Java program's InputReader's next() function, it reads the next token, which is split by whitespace. So if the first program's output is, say, \"1234\", then the second program's input is that entire number as a single token. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the C code should work as written.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the output is printed via System.out.println(...), which adds a newline. So when the second Java program reads the input, it would read the entire line (the number plus the newline?), but in the second Java program's InputReader's next() function, it reads the next token, which is the number (without the newline). Because next() uses StringTokenizer on the line, which splits on whitespace. So the newline is part of the line, but the next() would return the entire number as a token, ignoring the newline. So the C code's approach of converting the number to a string (without a newline) is correct, because the second program's input is the number as a string, not including the newline. Wait, but in the Java code, the first program's output is printed with a newline. So when the second program reads it, it would read the entire line (the number followed by a newline). But the next() function in the second Java program's InputReader would read the entire line (since the first token is the number, and the rest is the newline, but the next() would return the number as the first token, and the next() would read the next line (the empty line after the newline?), but no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is a single line with the number followed by a newline. So the second Java program's input is that line. The second program's InputReader's next() function reads the next token. The line is split into tokens by whitespace. Since the line is just the number followed by a newline, the first token is the number, and the next() would return that. So the S in the second program is exactly the string representation of the first program's output (without the newline). Therefore, in the C code, when converting the max_val to a string, we don't need to add a newline, because the second program's input is just the number as a string. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the C code as written should work."
