  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a value. The second takes that output as input and processes it further to give the final result. But in C, I have to combine them so that the first's output is the input for the second, but without using actual I/O in between. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does. \n\nThe first Java program (codeforces_189_A) is a dynamic programming problem. It reads three integers a, b, c and n. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make up n using coins of denominations a, b, c. Wait, no, actually looking at the code, the DP array is tracking the maximum number of coins? Wait, the code initializes dp[0] = 0, and for each denomination, it's doing dp[j] = max between current dp[j] and dp[j - arr[i]] +1. So it's trying to maximize the number of coins used to make j. Wait, but the problem might be to find the maximum number of coins to make exactly n, or maybe the problem is to find the minimal coins? Hmm, but the code's approach is for unbounded knapsack, but here it's maximizing the count. So the output is dp[n], which would be the maximum number of coins possible to sum to n. \n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, and counts the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019. The approach here is using modular arithmetic, precomputing the mod values and counting the number of pairs with the same mod. \n\nNow, the first program's output is the value of dp[n], which is an integer. The second program expects a string as input. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer, and the second program reads a string. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the second Java program's input is a string S. But the first program's output is an integer. So when they are run in sequence, the first program's output (the integer) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that integer as a string? Like, if the first outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\". \n\nAh right, because when you run them in sequence, the first program's output is printed, and that becomes the input to the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output. \n\nTherefore, in the C program, I need to compute the first program's result (the integer), then convert that integer to a string, and then process that string through the second program's logic. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, a, b, c) from stdin.\n2. Compute the first program's result (dp[n]).\n3. Convert that result to a string (like, the digits of the integer).\n4. Use that string as the input for the second program's processing.\n5. Output the final result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (n, a, b, c) from stdin.\n- Compute the first part's result (the DP part).\n- Convert that result to a string (so that it can be used as the input S for the second part).\n- Then process that string through the second part's algorithm.\n- Finally, output the answer from the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's variables:\n\n- n is the target sum.\n- a, b, c are the coin denominations.\n- The DP array is of size maxn (4010), initialized to -infinity except dp[0] =0.\n- Then for each of the three coins, iterate through the dp array and update the maximum coins possible.\n\nIn C, the DP array can be an int array of size 4010. The initial values can be set to -infinity, which in C is INT_MIN. But in C, we can use -2^31, but since integers can be up to 4010, maybe using INT_MIN is okay. \n\nWait, in C, the equivalent of Integer.MIN_VALUE is -2147483648. So in code:\n\nInitialize dp array with all elements to -2147483648 except dp[0] =0.\n\nThen for each of the three coins (a, b, c), loop from j = coin value to maxn, and set dp[j] = max between current dp[j] and dp[j - coin] +1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for each i from 0 to 2 (the three coins), then for j from arr[i] to dp.length (which is 4010). So in C, the coins are stored in an array arr[3], which is {a, b, c}.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nint arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n\nThen for each i in 0..2:\n\nfor (int j = arr[i]; j < maxn; j++) {\n\n    if (dp[j - arr[i]] != INT_MIN) { \n\n        // because if dp[j - arr[i]] is -infinity, then adding 1 would be invalid.\n\n        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] +1);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in Java's code, they don't check for that. The original code in Java just does Math.max, but if dp[j - arr[i]] is Integer.MIN_VALUE, then adding 1 would be problematic. Wait, but in Java, if dp[j - arr[i]] is Integer.MIN_VALUE, then dp[j - arr[i]] +1 would be -2147483647, but if the current dp[j] is also -infinity, then the max would be that. \n\nHmm, but in the code, the initial dp is set to -infinity except dp[0]. So for j starting from arr[i], the first time when j is arr[i], then j - arr[i] is 0, which has dp[0] =0. So that's okay. \n\nSo in C, the code can proceed similarly, but need to make sure that when dp[j - arr[i]] is -infinity, then we can't take that path. Wait, but in the original code, the code would just take the max between current (which is -infinity) and (dp[j - arr[i]] +1). But if dp[j - arr[i]] is -infinity, then that term is also -infinity, so the max would remain as -infinity. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without checking, as in Java. \n\nSo the first part's code in C would be:\n\nRead n, a, b, c from stdin.\n\nInitialize dp array of size 4010, set all to -2147483648 except dp[0] =0.\n\nThen loop over each of the three coins, and for each j from coin to 4010, update dp[j] as the max between current and dp[j - coin] +1.\n\nThen the result is dp[n].\n\nNow, the second part's code.\n\nThe second Java program takes a string S, and computes the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019.\n\nThe approach is to precompute mod values for each position. The code uses a mod_arr array where mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the substring from the end up to position i (or something like that). Let me re-examine the code.\n\nLooking at the Java code for the second program:\n\nThe code loops over i from 0 to N-1 (since N is the length of S). Wait, in the code, the loop is for (int i =0; i < N; i++)... but the S is processed in reverse. Let me see:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N-1 -i) - '0') * radix %2019;\n\n    if (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) %2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix *10 %2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, the S is processed in reverse order. Let me see:\n\nThe first character processed is S[N-1 -0] = S[N-1], which is the last character of the string. So the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning. \n\nThe variable 'radix' starts at 1. For each step, the current digit is (digit) * radix mod 2019. Then, if it's not the first iteration, add the previous mod value. \n\nWait, the idea here is to compute the mod of the substring S[N-1 -i ... N-1], but in a way that allows for efficient computation. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using a method where for each position i (starting from the end), the mod is computed as (digit * 10^i + previous mod) mod 2019. \n\nWait, perhaps the mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the substring from the end up to position (N-1 -i). \n\nThe key idea is that for a substring S[i..j], its value mod 2019 can be computed using some precomputed values. Since 2019 is the modulus, and 10^3 mod 2019 is a factor here. \n\nThe code's approach is to precompute for each position the mod value of the suffix starting at that position. \n\nThe formula for mod_arr[i] is:\n\nmod_arr[i] = (digit * 10^i + mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the mod values for the suffixes. Let me think:\n\nThe first iteration (i=0):\n\ndigit is S[N-1 -0] = last character. \n\ntmp = digit * 1 (radix starts at 1) mod 2019. \n\nSince i=0, no addition. So mod_arr[0] = digit * 1 mod 2019. \n\nThen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nradix becomes 10 mod 2019 (since 1*10 mod 2019 is 10).\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\ndigit is S[N-2], the second last character. \n\ntmp = digit * 10 (radix is now 10) mod 2019. \n\nThen add mod_arr[i-1] (mod_arr[0] = previous value) mod 2019. \n\nWait, so mod_arr[i] = (digit * 10^1 + mod_arr[0]) mod 2019. \n\nWait, but mod_arr[0] is the mod of the last digit. \n\nWait, perhaps mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the substring from the end up to position (N-1 -i). \n\nWait, for example, when i=0, it's the last character. \n\ni=1: the substring of the last two characters. \n\nSo the value is (digit * 10^1 + previous digit) mod 2019. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nThe key is that for each position, the current digit is multiplied by 10^i (since each step the radix is multiplied by 10). \n\nThe mod array is built such that mod_arr[i] is the mod of the substring S[N-1 -i ... N-1], which is the last (i+1) characters. \n\nThen, the mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs. \n\nThe answer is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], since then the difference between those two mod values would be divisible by 2019. \n\nWait, the formula for the answer is sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nBecause if two different indices have the same mod, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019. \n\nWait, the exact reasoning is that if mod_arr[i] = mod_arr[j], then the substring from (N-1 -i) to (N-1 -j -1) would have a mod of 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think through the math. \n\nThe mod of the substring from position k to the end (length m) is mod_arr[m-1 -k] ?\n\nNot sure, but the code's approach is that the total number of pairs with the same mod is the answer. \n\nThe code then adds mod_cnt[0] (since mod 0 is also a valid case). Wait, in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, no, in the code after the loop, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the code after the loop:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, no, in the code:\n\nWait, the code after the for loop over i is:\n\nlong ans =0;\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2019; i++) {\n\n    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2;\n\n}\n\nWait, why is mod_cnt[0] being incremented? \n\nWait, perhaps there's an off-by-one error here. Let me see the code again.\n\nWait, in the code for the second program:\n\nThe loop over i from 0 to N-1 (since N is the length of S). \n\nWait, the code's loop is for (int i=0; i < N; i++) { ... }\n\nWait, but the code's variables:\n\nmod_arr is of size N, and mod_cnt is of size 2019. \n\nWait, the code initializes mod_arr and mod_cnt. \n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nfor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n    compute tmp as the current digit multiplied by the current radix (which starts at 1, then multiplied by 10 each step). \n\n    if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp. \n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp mod 2019. \n\n    mod_cnt[tmp mod 2019] is incremented. \n\n    then, radix is updated. \n\nWait, but after the loop, the code does mod_cnt[0]++; \n\nWait, why? \n\nAh, perhaps the initial mod of 0 is being counted as an additional possibility. \n\nWait, maybe the code is considering the empty substring? Or perhaps there's an error here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the 0 mod as an extra case. \n\nWait, the problem requires the substring S[i..j], which is from i to j inclusive. The code's approach counts all pairs (i,j) where the mod of the substring is 0. \n\nThe way the mod array is built, mod_arr[i] is the mod of the substring from position (N-1 -i) to the end. \n\nSo, for two indices i and j (i < j), the substring from (N-1 -j) to (N-1 -i) would have a mod of (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j]) * 10^{something} mod 2019? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the key idea is that if two mod values are the same, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019. \n\nWait, let me think of two indices i and j where i < j. \n\nThe mod of the substring from (N-1 -j) to (N-1 -i) would be (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j]) * 10^{something} mod 2019? \n\nHmm, perhaps the exact math is that the mod of the substring between those two positions is (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j]) mod 2019. \n\nWait, maybe the mod of the substring from position k to position m (inclusive) is (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j]) mod 2019, where i and j are indices in the mod array. \n\nIf that's the case, then when mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], then the mod is 0, so the substring is divisible by 2019. \n\nTherefore, the number of such pairs is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], and i < j. \n\nThe total number is the sum over all m of (count[m] choose 2). \n\nBut in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is adding an extra 0 to account for the empty prefix? \n\nWait, looking at the code again:\n\nWait, the code's loop runs for i from 0 to N-1. \n\nThen, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering the case where the substring starts at the beginning. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me see the original problem's code. \n\nWait, the code for the second program is from atcoder ABC164 D. Let me check the problem's solution. \n\nThe problem requires counting the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019. \n\nThe standard approach for this problem is to note that for a number to be divisible by 2019, its mod 2019 must be 0. \n\nThe key insight is that for a substring S[i..j], its value mod 2019 can be computed as (val[j] - val[i-1] * 10^{j-i+1}) mod 2019. \n\nBut since 2019 factors into 3*673, and 10 and 2019 are not coprime, but the approach uses the fact that 10^3 mod 2019 is 1000 mod 2019, but perhaps the standard approach uses precomputing the mod values for prefixes. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each position the mod of the suffix starting at that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is as follows:\n\nLet me think of the string S as S_0 S_1 ... S_{N-1} (0-based). \n\nWe want to compute for each i < j, the substring S_i to S_j (inclusive) mod 2019. \n\nThe value of this substring is S_i * 10^{j-i} + S_{i+1}*10^{j-i-1} + ... + S_j. \n\nTo compute this mod 2019, note that 10^3 mod 2019 is 1000 mod 2019, but perhaps the code uses a different approach. \n\nThe code processes the string from the end, so for each position k (starting from the end), it computes the mod of the substring from k to the end. \n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote the suffix starting at position k (0-based from the start) as S[k..N-1]. \n\nThe code processes the string in reverse order. \n\nLet me reindex variables. \n\nLet me think of the code's variables:\n\nThe loop variable i in the code's for loop runs from 0 to N-1. \n\nThe current character is S[N-1 -i], which is the (N-1 -i)th character in the original string. \n\nSo for i=0, it's the last character (position N-1). \n\nFor i=1, it's the second last (position N-2), etc. \n\nThe 'radix' variable starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 2019. \n\nThe 'tmp' variable for each step is (digit * radix) mod 2019. \n\nThen, if it's not the first iteration (i !=0), add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, then mod 2019. \n\nWait, so mod_arr[i] is (digit * radix + mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019. \n\nWait, but the digit is multiplied by the current radix, which is 10^i mod 2019. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt step i=0:\n\ndigit is S[N-1], the last character. \n\nradix is 1. \n\ntmp = digit * 1 mod 2019. \n\nmod_arr[0] = tmp mod 2019. \n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nradix becomes 10 mod 2019. \n\nAt step i=1:\n\ndigit is S[N-2], the second last. \n\nradix is 10. \n\ntmp = digit * 10 mod 2019. \n\nThen add mod_arr[0] (the previous mod value) mod 2019. \n\nSo mod_arr[1] = (digit *10 + mod_arr[0]) mod 2019. \n\nThis represents the value of the substring S[N-2] followed by S[N-1], which is the last two characters. \n\nThe value is (digit *10 + previous digit) mod 2019. \n\nSimilarly, for i=2, the digit is S[N-3], multiplied by 100 (radix is 10^2 mod 2019?), then added to mod_arr[1], etc. \n\nThus, mod_arr[i] is the mod of the substring starting at position (N-1 -i) and going to the end. \n\nTherefore, the mod of the substring from position k (original index) to the end is mod_arr[i], where i = (N-1 -k). \n\nNow, to find the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring from i to j is divisible by 2019, we can note that for any two indices k and m (k < m), the substring from k to m is divisible by 2019 if and only if the mod of the suffix starting at k minus the mod of the suffix starting at m+1 multiplied by 10^{length} is congruent to 0 mod 2019. \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that the mod of the substring from k to m is equal to (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j] * 10^{something}) mod 2019, but this might complicate. \n\nAlternatively, the key idea is that for two positions p and q (p < q), the substring from p to q is divisible by 2019 if the mod of the suffix starting at p minus the mod of the suffix starting at q+1 multiplied by 10^{length} is congruent to 0 mod 2019. \n\nBut this might be too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to note that the mod of the substring from position k to position m is equal to (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j] * 10^{m -k +1}) mod 2019, but this requires knowing the exponent. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to consider that the mod of the substring from position k to the end is mod_arr[i], where i = (N-1 -k). \n\nThen, for any two indices i1 and i2 (i1 < i2), the substring from position (N-1 -i2) to (N-1 -i1) would have a mod of (mod_arr[i1] - mod_arr[i2] * 10^{something}) mod 2019. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is that the mod of the substring between two positions can be derived from their mod values. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that the mod of the substring from position k to position m (inclusive) is equal to (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j] * 10^{m -k +1}) mod 2019, but this requires knowing the exponent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is that the mod of the substring from position k to the end is mod_arr[i], and the mod of the substring from position k to m is (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j] * 10^{length}) mod 2019, but this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that the mod of the substring from position k to m is equal to mod_arr[i] mod 2019, where i is the index corresponding to position k. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is counting all pairs of indices (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], and then the substring between those two positions (in the original string) is divisible by 2019. \n\nWait, if mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], then the substring from (N-1 -i) to (N-1 -j) would have a mod of 0? \n\nWait, let me think of two indices i and j where i < j. \n\nThe mod of the suffix starting at position (N-1 -i) is mod_arr[i]. \n\nThe mod of the suffix starting at position (N-1 -j) is mod_arr[j]. \n\nThe substring between those two positions (from (N-1 -j) to (N-1 -i -1)) would have a mod of (mod_arr[i] - mod_arr[j] * 10^{something}) mod 2019. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nThe code's approach is that the number of pairs is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nThe code increments mod_cnt[0] by 1 before computing the sum. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering the empty substring? Or maybe there's an off-by-one error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is adding an extra 0 to account for the case where the entire string is considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is wrong, but since it's given as part of the problem, I have to replicate it exactly. \n\nIn any case, the code's logic is:\n\n- After processing all characters, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\n- Then, for each mod value, the number of pairs is count*(count-1)/2. \n\nSo the code's final answer is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nTherefore, in the C code, I need to replicate this logic. \n\nNow, putting it all together. \n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read n, a, b, c from stdin. \n\n2. Compute the first part's result (dp[n]). \n\n3. Convert that integer to a string (so that it can be the input S for the second part). \n\n4. Process that string through the second part's algorithm. \n\n5. Output the final answer. \n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, the first part's code in C:\n\nRead n, a, b, c. \n\nInitialize dp array of size 4010. \n\nSet all elements to -2147483648 except dp[0] =0. \n\nLoop over each of the three coins (a, b, c). \n\nWait, in C, the coins are stored in an array. \n\nThen, for each coin in arr[3], loop j from coin to 4010 (since maxn is 4010). \n\nWait, the array is size 4010, so indices 0 to 4009. \n\nWait, the original Java code uses maxn =4010, so the dp array is of size 4010. \n\nWait, in Java, the array is new int[maxn], so indices 0 to maxn-1. \n\nThus, in C, the array should be of size 4010. \n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is for (int j = arr[i]; j < dp.length; j++) in Java. \n\nIn C, the loop would be for (j = arr[i]; j < 4010; j++) \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is up to dp.length (which is 4010), so the indices go up to 4009. \n\nWait, in Java, the for loop is for (j from arr[i] to dp.length -1). \n\nSo in C, the loop should be for (j from arr[i] to 4009). \n\nWait, but in code, the loop in Java is written as for (int j = arr[i]; j < dp.length; j++), so in C, it's for (j = arr[i]; j < 4010; j++). \n\nSo the code for the first part:\n\nint maxn = 4010;\n\nint dp[maxn];\n\nfor (int i =0; i < maxn; i++) dp[i] = -2147483648;\n\ndp[0] =0;\n\nint arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    int coin = arr[i];\n\n    for (int j=coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n\n        if (dp[j - coin] +1 > dp[j]) {\n\n            dp[j] = dp[j - coin] +1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint result = dp[n];\n\nThen, the second part's code:\n\nWe need to process the result (the integer) as a string. \n\nSo first, convert the integer to a string. \n\nIn C, to convert an integer to a string, we can use sprintf. \n\nchar s[20]; // assuming the result is up to 10 digits (since n can be up to 4010, which is 4 digits, but maybe more?)\n\nWait, the maximum possible n is 4010 (since the dp array is up to 4010). So the maximum value of dp[n] would be when n is 4010, and the coins are 1, so the maximum coins would be 4010. So the number of digits is up to 4 (since 4010 is 4 digits). \n\nBut to be safe, let's use a buffer of 20 characters. \n\nchar s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%d\", result);\n\nThen, the length N is strlen(s). \n\nThen, process the string s as per the second program's code. \n\nNow, the second part's code in C:\n\nint N = strlen(s);\n\nint mod_arr[N]; \n\nint mod_cnt[2019] = {0};\n\nint radix =1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int pos = N-1 -i;\n\n    int digit = s[pos] - '0';\n\n    int tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019;\n\n    if (i !=0) {\n\n        tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) %2019;\n\n    }\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = (radix *10) %2019;\n\n}\n\n// Now, increment mod_cnt[0] by 1?\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. \n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, but why? \n\nLooking back at the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop over i from 0 to N-1, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nThen, the answer is computed as the sum over mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2. \n\nWait, perhaps this is a mistake. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the mod_cnt array is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, during the loop, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\nThis would add an extra count for 0. \n\nBut why? \n\nPerhaps the code is considering the empty substring? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is wrong, but since it's given, I have to replicate it. \n\nSo in C, after the loop, we have to do mod_cnt[0] +=1; \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nSo in C:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nThen compute the answer. \n\nlong long ans =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2019; i++) {\n\n    ans += (long long) mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) /2;\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\nPutting it all together. \n\nNow, the full C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, a, b, c;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b, &c);\n    \n    // First part: compute dp[n]\n    const int maxn = 4010;\n    int dp[maxn];\n    for (int i = 0; i < maxn; i++) {\n        dp[i] = -2147483648;\n    }\n    dp[0] = 0;\n    int arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        int coin = arr[i];\n        for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n            if (dp[j - coin] + 1 > dp[j]) {\n                dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    int result = dp[n];\n    \n    // Convert result to string\n    char s[20];\n    sprintf(s, \"%d\", result);\n    int N = strlen(s);\n    \n    // Second part: process the string\n    int mod_arr[N];\n    int mod_cnt[2019] = {0};\n    int radix = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int pos = N - 1 - i;\n        int digit = s[pos] - '0';\n        int tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019;\n        if (i != 0) {\n            tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n        }\n        mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n        mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n        radix = (radix * 10) % 2019;\n    }\n    mod_cnt[0]++; // as per the Java code\n    \n    long long ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n        ans += (long long) mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i] - 1) / 2;\n    }\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, what if n is larger than maxn (4010)? The original Java code uses maxn =4010, so if n is larger than that, the code would have dp[n] as -infinity, but the problem's constraints probably ensure that n is within the array's size. \n\nAssuming that the problem constraints for the first program are such that n is up to 4010, so the code is okay. \n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's input is \"0\", which is length 1. \n\nIn the second part's code, N=1. \n\nLoop for i=0:\n\npos =0, digit is '0' - '0' =0. \n\ntmp =0 *1 mod2019 =0. \n\nsince i=0, no addition. \n\nmod_arr[0] =0. \n\nmod_cnt[0] becomes 1. \n\nradix becomes 10 mod2019. \n\nThen mod_cnt[0] is incremented to 2. \n\nThe answer is (2 choose 2) =1. \n\nWhich would be correct because the substring \"0\" is divisible by 2019 (0 mod 2019 is 0). But the problem requires pairs (i,j) with i<j. Since the string is length 1, there are no such pairs. \n\nWait, this suggests a problem. \n\nWait, in the case where the input is \"0\", the string length is 1. \n\nThe code's second part would compute mod_cnt[0] as 1 (from the loop) plus 1 (the increment) =2. \n\nThen the answer is 2*(2-1)/2 =1. \n\nBut the actual number of pairs (i,j) with i<j is zero. \n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here. \n\nThis suggests that the code's increment of mod_cnt[0] is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the Java code has a mistake here. \n\nLooking back at the Java code for the second program:\n\nThe code's loop runs for i from 0 to N-1 (since N is the length of S). \n\nThen, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\nIn the case of S being \"0\", the loop runs once (i=0). \n\nmod_arr[0] is 0. \n\nmod_cnt[0] is 1. \n\nThen mod_cnt[0] becomes 2. \n\nThe answer is 2 choose 2 =1. \n\nBut the correct answer should be 1 (the substring \"0\" is divisible by 2019, but since it's length 1, the problem requires pairs i<j, so there are no pairs. \n\nWait, the problem requires pairs (i,j) with i < j. \n\nThe substring from i to j must have length at least 2? Or can it be length 1? \n\nThe problem statement says \"the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019\". \n\nA single character is a valid substring (length 1). \n\nBut the problem requires pairs (i,j) with i < j. \n\nWait, the indices are 0-based. For a string of length 1, the only possible pair would be i=0 and j=0, but i must be < j. \n\nSo there are no valid pairs. \n\nThus, the code's answer of 1 is wrong. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code has a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct and I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019\". \n\nIn the case of S being \"0\", the substring from i=0 to j=0 is length 1, but i is not less than j. \n\nThus, the correct answer is 0. \n\nBut the code's approach gives 1. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect, but since the user provided the Java code, I have to replicate it exactly. \n\nTherefore, the C code must also have this increment. \n\nThus, the code proceeds as written. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose the first program outputs 2019. \n\nThe string is \"2019\". \n\nThe second program's input is \"2019\". \n\nThe code processes this string. \n\nThe length N is 4. \n\nThe mod_arr array will be computed as follows:\n\nProcessing from the end (digits '9', '1', '0', '2').\n\nWait, let's walk through the steps:\n\ni=0 (processing the last character '9'):\n\ndigit =9, radix=1. \n\ntmp =9 *1 mod2019 =9. \n\nmod_arr[0] =9. \n\nmod_cnt[9] becomes 1. \n\nradix becomes 10. \n\ni=1 (processing '1'):\n\ndigit=1. \n\ntmp =1 *10 mod2019 =10. \n\nAdd mod_arr[0] (9) \u2192 10+9=19 mod2019 \u219219. \n\nmod_arr[1] =19. \n\nmod_cnt[19] becomes 1. \n\nradix becomes 100 mod2019 (100). \n\ni=2 (processing '0'):\n\ndigit=0. \n\ntmp =0 *100 mod2019 =0. \n\nAdd mod_arr[1] (19) \u2192 19 mod2019 \u219219. \n\nmod_arr[2] =19. \n\nmod_cnt[19] becomes 2. \n\nradix becomes 1000 mod2019. \n\ni=3 (processing '2'):\n\ndigit=2. \n\ntmp =2 *1000 mod2019 \u2192 2000 mod2019 is 2000-2019= -19 mod2019 \u2192 2000 mod2019 is 2000-2019= -19 \u2192 mod2019 is 2000. \n\nWait, 2000 mod2019 is 2000. \n\nThen add mod_arr[2] (19) \u2192 2000 +19 =2019 mod2019 \u21920. \n\nmod_arr[3] =0. \n\nmod_cnt[0] becomes 1 (from this step). \n\nradix becomes (1000 *10) mod2019 \u2192 10000 mod2019. \n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nNow, mod_cnt[0] is 2 (from the initial 1 (from mod_arr[3] =0) plus the increment). \n\nThe other counts: \n\nmod_cnt[9] =1, mod_cnt[19]=2, mod_cnt[0] =2. \n\nThe total ans is (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) + ... \n\nWait, mod_cnt[0] is 2 \u2192 contributes 1. \n\nmod_cnt[19] is 2 \u2192 contributes 1. \n\nmod_cnt[9] is 1 \u2192 0. \n\nOther mod values are 0. \n\nTotal ans is 1+1 =2. \n\nThe actual valid pairs:\n\nLooking for substrings divisible by 2019. \n\nThe string is \"2019\". \n\nPossible substrings:\n\nIndices (0,3) \u2192 \"2019\" \u2192 2019 mod2019 =0 \u2192 valid. \n\nIndices (3,3) \u2192 \"9\" \u2192 9 mod2019 \u2192 no. \n\nIndices (0,0) \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 no. \n\nIndices (0,2) \u2192 \"201\" \u2192 201 mod2019 \u2192 no. \n\nIndices (1,3) \u2192 \"019\" \u2192 19 mod2019 \u2192 no. \n\nIndices (0,3) is the only valid pair (i=0, j=3). \n\nWait, but the code's answer is 2. \n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, the code's answer would be 2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code is incorrect. \n\nBut since the user provided the Java code, I have to replicate it exactly. \n\nTherefore, the C code must follow the same logic, even if it has a mistake. \n\nThus, the code is as written. \n\nAnother possible error is in the mod calculation. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints, I'll proceed with the code as per the Java's logic. \n\nThus, the final C code is as written above."
