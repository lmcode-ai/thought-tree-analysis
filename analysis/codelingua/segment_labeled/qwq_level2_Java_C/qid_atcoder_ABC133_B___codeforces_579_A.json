To store them, we can have a 2D array. Since in C, a 2D array can be a pointer to pointers, but for dynamic allocation, perhaps:\n\nint **vectors = malloc(N * sizeof(int*));\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n    vectors[i] = malloc(D * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int j=0; j<D; j++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &vectors[i][j]);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, using a single array and treating it as 2D:\n\nint (*vectors)[D] = malloc(N * D * sizeof(int)); // Not sure if this is possible since D is variable.\n\nWait, variable-length arrays (VLA) in C99 allow this. So if the compiler supports C99, then:\n\nint (*vectors)[D] = malloc(N * sizeof(*vectors));\n\nBut D is a variable here, so the size of each row is D integers. So using VLA:\n\nint vectors[N][D]; // But N and D are variables, so this is a VLA. So if the compiler allows it, this is okay.\n\nAlternatively, using a 1D array and compute indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach with pointers is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the first approach using malloc for each row.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the vectors are stored as a 2D array. So in C, using a 2D array via dynamic allocation.\n\nSo code for vectors:\n\nint **vectors = (int**)malloc(N * sizeof(int*));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    vectors[i] = (int*)malloc(D * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < D; j++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &vectors[i][j]);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, after processing, we need to free the memory. But since the program is short and exits after, maybe it's okay to not free, but better to do so to prevent memory leaks.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nNow, compute the answer for the first part.\n\nInitialize answer to 0.\n\nLoop over all i from 0 to N-2:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {\n\n    for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++) {\n\n        int dist = 0;\n\n        for (int d = 0; d < D; d++) {\n\n            int x = vectors[i][d] - vectors[j][d];\n\n            dist += x * x;\n\n        }\n\n        double sq = sqrt(dist);\n\n        // Check if sqrt is integer.\n\n        if (fabs(sq - (int)sq) < 0.001) {\n\n            answer++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the Java code uses Math.floor, so the condition is (sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001. So in C, we can do:\n\ndouble fractional = sq - floor(sq);\n\nif (fabs(fractional) < 0.001) then count.\n\nAlternatively, since sqrt returns a double, and we can check if the difference between the square and the squared integer is small.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the square of the rounded value and see if it equals the distance.\n\nAlternatively, the original code's approach is to check if the square root is an integer up to 0.001 precision.\n\nSo in C:\n\nif (fabs(sq - (int)sq) < 0.001) ?\n\nWait, but (int)sq would truncate towards zero, but floor would be same for positive numbers. Since distance is non-negative, sqrt is non-negative, so floor and (int) would be same here.\n\nWait, for example, if sq is 3.999, then floor is 3, so 3.999 -3 = 0.999, which is over 0.001. But if it's 3.0001, then 3.0001 -3 = 0.0001 <0.001, so it would count as integer.\n\nWait the condition in Java is (Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001). So in C, we can do:\n\ndouble fractional = sq - floor(sq);\n\nif (fabs(fractional) < 0.001) then count.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndouble fractional = sq - floor(sq);\n\nif (fabs(fractional) < 0.001) answer++;\n\nAlternatively, since floor is included in math.h, so need to include that.\n\nSo the code for the first part's loop is as above.\n\nOnce the first answer is computed, then the second part is to take that answer as n, compute the number of 1 bits.\n\nSo:\n\nint n = answer;\n\nint ans = 0;\n\nwhile (n > 0) {\n\n    ans += n % 2;\n\n    n /= 2;\n\n}\n\nThen, printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling the vectors correctly.\n\nWait, but in C, the loops for the first part's distance calculation must be correct.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N, D;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &D);\n\n    int **vectors = (int **)malloc(N * sizeof(int *));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        vectors[i] = (int *)malloc(D * sizeof(int));\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < D; j++) {\n\n            scanf(\"%d\", &vectors[i][j]);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int answer = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {\n\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {\n\n            int dist = 0;\n\n            for (int d = 0; d < D; d++) {\n\n                int x = vectors[i][d] - vectors[j][d];\n\n                dist += x * x;\n\n            }\n\n            double sq = sqrt(dist);\n\n            double fractional = sq - floor(sq);\n\n            if (fabs(fractional) < 0.001) {\n\n                answer++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Free the vectors\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        free(vectors[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    free(vectors);\n\n    // Now compute second part\n\n    int n = answer;\n\n    int ans = 0;\n\n    while (n > 0) {\n\n        ans += n % 2;\n\n        n /= 2;\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the code converts n to binary by appending the remainders, then counts the 1's. The C code here does the same by checking n%2 each time. So that's correct.\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the sqrt function requires math.h, which is included.\n\nThe malloc and free are properly handled.\n\nWait, but in the first part, after computing answer, we can free the vectors, but since we don't need them anymore, that's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, the distance is computed as the sum of squares, then sqrt. The condition is whether the sqrt is an integer (within 0.001 precision). So the code in C is correct.\n\nEdge cases: when dist is zero? Well, if two vectors are the same, then distance is zero, sqrt(0) is 0.0, so fractional is 0, so it counts. But in the loops, i and j are different (since j starts at i+1), so same vectors would count as a pair with distance zero, which is an integer. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: when dist is a perfect square, like 4, sqrt is 2.0, so fractional is 0. So counted.\n\nNow, what about when the distance is 2, sqrt is ~1.414, so fractional is 0.414, which is more than 0.001, so not counted.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part: when n is zero? Well, the second Java program would output 0, since the loop would not run. But in the first part, answer can be zero, so n=0, then ans remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the first part's answer is 5, then the second part would count the 1's in 101, which is 2. Let's see:\n\n5 in binary is 101, so two 1's. The code would do 5%2=1, add to ans (ans=1), then 5/2=2. Then 2%2=0, ans stays, 2/2=1. Then 1%2=1, ans becomes 2, then 0.5 floored to 0. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check for possible errors in the C code.\n\nWait, in the loops for the vectors, the inner loop for j is from 0 to D-1, which is correct.\n\nWait, in the code for vectors[i][d], yes.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loops, the outer loops are i from 0 to N-2 (since i < N-1), and j from i+1 to N-1. That's correct for all pairs i < j.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the final C program is as written above."
