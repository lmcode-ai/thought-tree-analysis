In C, string comparison is done with strcmp. So:\n\nif (strcmp(u, str0) == 0) then a = a-1, else b = b-1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the condition is u.equals(str[0]). So yes, exactly.\n\nBut need to make sure that the u string (third line) is exactly equal to str0 (the first part of first line). Including case? The Java code uses equals, which is case-sensitive. So in C, strcmp is case-sensitive, which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char first_line[100];\n    fgets(first_line, sizeof(first_line), stdin);\n    char str0[50], str1[50];\n    sscanf(first_line, \"%s %s\", str0, str1); // assuming first line has two words.\n\n    char second_line[100];\n    fgets(second_line, sizeof(second_line), stdin);\n    int a, b;\n    sscanf(second_line, \"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    char u[100];\n    fgets(u, sizeof(u), stdin);\n    // Remove newline from u if present\n    u[strcspn(u, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    // Compare u and str0\n    if (strcmp(u, str0) == 0) {\n        a--;\n    } else {\n        b--;\n    }\n\n    // Now compute the second part\n    int c = a - 2 * b;\n    if (c < 0) c = 0;\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but what about the first_line's possible trailing newline? The first_line's fgets includes the newline, but when using sscanf with %s, it stops at whitespace, so the first word is str0, the second is str1. But if the first line has more than two words, this code would take the first two. But the original Java code uses split(\" \"), so all whitespace is split, but the code uses str[0], so perhaps the first line is exactly two words. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing: the second_line's sscanf may have more than two numbers, but the Java code uses nextToken twice, so it's expecting exactly two. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the third line's u is exactly str0. Then a is decremented by 1, then compute c.\n\nAnother case: if u is different, then b is decremented.\n\nNow, what about if the third line has a newline? The fgets includes the newline, but we remove it with strcspn. So the u string is now without the newline, which matches the Java's readLine() which doesn't include the newline.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the first_line's processing, the first_line may have leading or trailing spaces? For example, if the first line is \"  hello   world  \", then sscanf would read \"hello\" and \"world\" into str0 and str1, which is the same as Java's split on whitespace. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: the size of the arrays. The first_line is 100, which may be too small. But given that the problem is from AtCoder, the input lines are probably not too long. But in a real scenario, maybe better to use larger buffers, but for the problem's sake, this should be okay.\n\nSo the final C code is as above."
