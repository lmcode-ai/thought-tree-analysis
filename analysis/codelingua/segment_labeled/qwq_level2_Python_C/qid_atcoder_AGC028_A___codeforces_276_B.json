Now, the code can be written as follows:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    char S[1000], T[1000];\n    char s_str[1000], t_str[1000];\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n    fgets(s_str, sizeof(s_str), stdin);\n    fgets(t_str, sizeof(t_str), stdin);\n\n    s_str[strcspn(s_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n    t_str[strcspn(t_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    strcpy(S, s_str);\n    strcpy(T, t_str);\n\n    int Flag = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int temp = i * M;\n        if (temp % N == 0) {\n            int j = temp / N;\n            if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n                Flag = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    char intermediate_str[20]; if (Flag) {\n        strcpy(intermediate_str, \"-1\");\n    } else {\n        int g = gcd(N, M);\n        int lcm = (N * M) / g;\n        sprintf(intermediate_str, \"%d\", lcm);\n    }\n\n    int count[256] = {0};\n    int len = strlen(intermediate_str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = intermediate_str[i];\n        count[c]++;\n    }\n\n    int odd_count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {\n            odd_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (odd_count <= 1) {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    } else {\n        if (len % 2 == 0) {\n            printf(\"Second\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in the first part's code, the check is done for all i where (i*M) mod N ==0. For each such i, compute j and check S[i] vs T[j]. If any of them differ, Flag is set to 1. This is correct. Now, testing this code with sample inputs. Sample Input 1:\n\nSuppose N=2, M=2, S=\"ab\", T=\"cd\". Then for i=0: 0*2 mod 2 =0 \u2192 j=0. Check S[0] (a) vs T[0] (c) \u2192 not equal \u2192 Flag=1. So output is \"-1\". Then second part processes \"-1\" \u2192 counts: '-', '1' \u2192 two odds. Length is 2 (even). So output \"Second\". Sample Output would be \"Second\". Another test case where first part passes:\n\nN=2, M=2, S=\"ab\", T=\"ab\". Then for i=0: j=0 \u2192 a vs a \u2192 ok.\n\ni=1: 1*2 mod 2 =0 \u2192 j=1 \u2192 b vs b \u2192 ok. So Flag=0. LCM is (2*2)/2 =2 \u2192 \"2\". Second part processes \"2\" \u2192 counts: '2' once \u2192 odd_count=1 \u2192 output \"First\". Another test case where first part's output is \"123\". Then second part's input is \"123\" \u2192 counts 1,2,3 each once \u2192 odd_count=3. Length is 3 (odd). So output \"First\". Another case where first part's output is \"12\" \u2192 counts 1 and 2 \u2192 two odds. Length even \u2192 \"Second\". This code should handle all these cases.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. The first part reads N and M, then strings S and T. It converts them into lists. Then it creates Number_i as a list from 0 to N-1. Number_iMN is each i multiplied by M/N. Wait, but in Python, division with / gives a float. Then Number_j is 0 to M-1. Kaburi_j is the intersection of Number_iMN and Number_j. So those are the j values that are in both sets. Then Kaburi_i is calculated by taking each j in Kaburi_j and converting back to i via j*N/M. \n\nThen they check for each of these positions in S and T. If any pair doesn't match, Flag becomes 1. If all match, compute the LCM (since N*M/gcd(N,M) is LCM). If Flag is 1, output -1 else LCM.\n\nWait, but the second part of File 1 is a gcd function and the print. So the first part is checking if the overlapping characters at the aligned positions are the same. If not, output -1, else LCM.\n\nNow, the second Python file (File 2) reads a string, counts character frequencies. Then checks if more than one character has an odd count. If all even or exactly one odd, then output \"First\" or \"Second\" based on some conditions. Wait, the code in File 2's logic: \n\nThe code counts the characters. Then for each value, if it's odd and cnt is 0, increment cnt. If another odd comes when cnt is already 1, set x to False. Then, if x is true, print \"First\". Else, if not x and even length, print \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nHmm, so the second file's output depends on the counts and the string length. But how does this connect to the first file? Since the user says the programs are executed in sequence, the output of File 1 is the input to File 2. Wait, but looking at the code, the first file's output is either -1 or the LCM. The second file takes input as a string (since it's using input() which in Python reads a line). Wait, but the first file's output is a number. So the second file is expecting that number as input? Or maybe the first file's output is a string that the second file processes?\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is either -1 or the LCM value. So the second program would read that as a string. But in the second Python code, it's taking the input as a string (since it's converting to a list of characters). So the second program is processing the output of the first as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"12\", then the second would process the string \"12\".\n\nWait, but in the second Python code, the input is read as a single line, then split into a list of characters. So the input to the second program is whatever the first program outputs. So the first program's output is a number (either -1 or LCM), which is printed as a string. So the second program will process that string. \n\nTherefore, the C program must first compute the first part (the first Python file's logic), then pass that result as input to the second part (the second Python file's logic), but all in one C program. \n\nSo the C program must first read the input for the first part (N, M, S, T), compute the first part's result (either -1 or LCM), then use that result as the input for the second part (i.e., process the string representation of that result as the input string for the second part's logic), and then output the final result of the second part.\n\nTherefore, the C program structure will be:\n\n- Read N, M, S, T from input.\n\n- Compute the first part's logic (Flag and LCM).\n\n- If Flag is set, output is \"-1\", else the LCM as a string.\n\n- Then, take that result (either \"-1\" or the LCM as a string) and process it through the second part's logic.\n\n- Output the result of the second part.\n\nWait, but in the second Python file, the input is a single string. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, becomes a string. So the second program's input is that string. So in C, after computing the first part's result (either -1 or LCM), we need to convert that into a string (like \"-1\" or \"12\" etc.), then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read N, M, S, T.\n\n2. Compute the first part's logic (Flag and LCM).\n\n3. Generate the intermediate string (the output of first part) as a string.\n\n4. Process that string through the second part's logic (count characters, check conditions, etc.)\n\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in C.\n\nFirst part:\n\nThe first part's steps:\n\n- Read N and M as integers.\n\n- Read S and T as strings (null-terminated).\n\n- Convert S and T into arrays of characters (since in C, strings are arrays).\n\nWait, in C, strings are arrays. So for S and T, we can read them with fgets, then process.\n\nBut first, need to read N and M. Let's see:\n\nIn the first Python file:\n\nN, M = map(int, input().split())\n\nSo first line has two integers. Then next two lines are S and T.\n\nSo in C, first read the first line, split into N and M. Then read the next two lines for S and T.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead first line: scanf for N and M. But need to read until newline. Alternatively, read with fgets and then parse.\n\nAlternatively, using scanf:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M); but that would read until the next whitespace, but the rest of the line is ignored. Wait, but the user might have input with leading or trailing spaces, but the problem probably expects that the first line is exactly two integers separated by space.\n\nAssuming that, then scanf can work.\n\nThen read S and T as strings. Need to read until newline. So using fgets with a buffer.\n\nBut need to know the maximum possible length. Since in Python, the input() reads until newline, so in C, we can read with a buffer of say 1000 characters (assuming the problem constraints allow that).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nchar s_str[1000], t_str[1000];\n\nfgets(s_str, sizeof(s_str), stdin); // but this includes the newline. So need to remove it.\n\nWait, better to read until the newline is found and null-terminate.\n\nAlternatively, use sscanf after fgets.\n\nAlternatively, use getchar() to read until newline.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAfter reading N and M, read S:\n\nfgets(s_str, 1000, stdin); then remove the trailing newline.\n\nSame for T.\n\nBut need to be careful with the input.\n\nOnce S and T are read, then proceed.\n\nNow, the first part's logic:\n\nCompute Number_iMN as i * M / N for each i from 0 to N-1. But since in Python, division with / is floating point. So in C, we need to compute (i * M) / N as a float? Or perhaps as a double.\n\nWait, in Python, the list Number_iMN is [i * M / N for i in range(N)]. So each element is a float. Then Number_j is [0,1,...,M-1].\n\nThen Kaburi_j is the intersection of the set of Number_iMN and the set of Number_j. So the j's that are in both sets. Since Number_j is integers from 0 to M-1, the elements in Number_iMN that are integers between 0 and M-1.\n\nWait, but Number_iMN is a list of floats. So when taking the set intersection, the elements in Number_iMN that are integers and in the range [0, M).\n\nWait, because Number_j is integers from 0 to M-1. So Kaburi_j is the set of integers j in 0..M-1 that are present in Number_iMN.\n\nSo for each i in 0..N-1, compute (i*M)/N. If that value is an integer and between 0 and M-1 (inclusive?), then it's part of Kaburi_j.\n\nWait, but in Python, the set(Number_iMN) would include all the values (floats) from the list. The set(Number_j) is the integers 0 to M-1. So the intersection is the set of integers j where j is in the list Number_iMN.\n\nSo Kaburi_j is the list of integers j where j = (i*M)/N for some i in 0..N-1, and j must be an integer between 0 and M-1.\n\nWait, but (i*M)/N must be an integer? Because j has to be in Number_j (which are integers). So only those i where (i*M) is divisible by N will have their (i*M/N) be integer, so those are the j's that are in both sets.\n\nTherefore, Kaburi_j is the list of j's where j = (i*M)/N for some i, and j must be integer between 0 and M-1.\n\nSo in C, to compute this:\n\nWe can loop over each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nCompute j_float = (i * M) / (double)N; \n\nCheck if j_float is integer (i.e., (i*M) mod N == 0). Because if (i*M) is divisible by N, then j_float is integer. \n\nWait, because (i*M)/N must be an integer for j to be in Number_j (since j must be an integer in 0..M-1). \n\nWait, but even if (i*M) is divisible by N, the resulting j must be less than M. Because j is in Number_j (0 to M-1). \n\nWait, since i is up to N-1, then (i*M)/N can be up to ( (N-1)*M ) / N. Since (N-1)/N is less than 1, so (N-1)*M / N < M. So yes, j will be less than M. So the j's are automatically in 0..M-1.\n\nTherefore, for each i, if (i*M) mod N ==0, then j = (i*M)/N is an integer between 0 and M-1, so it's part of Kaburi_j.\n\nTherefore, the Kaburi_j list is all such j's. \n\nSo in C, we can collect all such j's into an array.\n\nThen, for each such j, we can compute the corresponding i as (j*N)/M. Because j = (i*M)/N \u2192 i = (j*N)/M. Since j is (i*M)/N, then (j*N)/M must equal i. But since j is an integer, and (i*M) must be divisible by N, so (j*N)/M must be integer. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose i*M is divisible by N \u2192 j = (i*M)/N is integer. Then, (j*N)/M = ( (i*M/N) * N ) / M = i*M / M = i. So yes, that gives back the original i. So Kaburi_i is the list of i's corresponding to each j in Kaburi_j.\n\nTherefore, the Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j are pairs where i = (j*N)/M and j = (i*M)/N.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\n- Iterate over each i from 0 to N-1.\n\n- For each i, compute temp = i * M. Check if temp % N ==0. If yes, then j = temp / N.\n\n- Then add j to Kaburi_j list.\n\nBut since j can be generated multiple times (for different i's?), but since we are using a set, duplicates are removed. Wait, in Python, the Kaburi_j is the set of such j's. So in C, we need to collect unique j's.\n\nWait, in the Python code, Number_iMN is a list of all (i*M/N) for each i. Then Kaburi_j is the intersection of that list and the Number_j list (0..M-1). So the set of j's that are present in both. Since Number_j is all integers from 0 to M-1, the intersection is the set of j's that are in Number_iMN (i.e., j is an integer and equal to (i*M)/N for some i).\n\nTherefore, in C, we can collect all such j's, but ensuring uniqueness. So perhaps we can use a boolean array for j's up to M-1, mark which are present, then collect them in order.\n\nAlternatively, since the order might not matter, but in the code, the Kaburi_j list is in the order of the i's, but duplicates would be removed via the set. So in C, we can collect all j's, then sort and deduplicate, but perhaps it's easier to use a hash or array to track which j's are present.\n\nLet me think of the steps in C:\n\nInitialize an array of booleans (or a bitset) for j from 0 to M-1, initialized to false.\n\nThen for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   temp = i * M;\n\n   if (temp % N == 0) {\n\n       j = temp / N;\n\n       if (j < M) { // which it will be, as discussed earlier\n\n           mark the j as present.\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nThen collect all j's where the flag is set. \n\nOnce we have all the j's, we can store them in an array Kaburi_j.\n\nThen, for each j in Kaburi_j, compute i = (j * N)/M. Since j is (i*M)/N, so (j*N)/M = i. So that's correct.\n\nThen, Kaburi_i is the list of those i's.\n\nNow, the code then checks for each pair (i,j) in Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j (since they are in the same order?), whether S[i] == T[j]. \n\nWait, in the Python code, Kaburi_i is built by iterating over Kaburi_j's elements. For each j in Kaburi_j, compute i = j*N/M. So the Kaburi_i list is in the same order as Kaburi_j. So for each index in Kaburi_j, the corresponding Kaburi_i is the i for that j. \n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\ncounter starts at 0, and for each counter, check S[Kaburi_i[counter]] == T[Kaburi_j[counter]].\n\nSo in C, the Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j arrays must be in the same order. So when collecting the j's, we need to store them in an array, and then for each j in that array, compute the i and store in Kaburi_i array.\n\nTherefore, the steps in C would be:\n\n- Collect all j's (unique) in an array Kaburi_j.\n\n- Then create Kaburi_i array where each element is (j * N)/M for each j in Kaburi_j.\n\nThen loop through each index, check S[i] vs T[j].\n\nNow, in C, the strings S and T are arrays of characters. So S is s_str (the input string), and T is t_str. So S[i] is s_str[i], etc.\n\nNow, the code also has a gcd function. The Python code defines a gcd function, which is the standard Euclidean algorithm. So in C, we can implement that.\n\nNow, after all that, if any of the characters don't match, Flag is set to 1, and output is -1. Else, compute LCM = N*M / gcd(N,M).\n\nNow, the first part's output is either -1 or LCM. \n\nNow, the second part of the problem is to take that output as input and process it through the second Python code's logic.\n\nThe second Python code reads a string (the input is a single line, which is the output of the first part). So in C, the first part's output is a string (either \"-1\" or the LCM as a string). \n\nSo after computing the first part's result, we need to generate that string, then process it through the second part's logic.\n\nThe second part's logic:\n\nRead the input string (the first part's output), count the frequency of each character. Then check if there is at most one character with an odd count. \n\nIf all even counts or exactly one odd, then:\n\nIf all even: output \"First\".\n\nWait, no, let me recheck the code:\n\nIn the second Python code:\n\nThe code first counts the characters in s (the input string). Then, for each key in the dictionary:\n\nif the value is odd and cnt is 0 \u2192 increment cnt.\n\nElse if it's odd and cnt >=1 \u2192 set x to False and break.\n\nThen, if x is True \u2192 print \"First\".\n\nElse, if not x and the length is even \u2192 print \"Second\".\n\nElse (not x and length odd) \u2192 print \"First\".\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nx starts as True.\n\nThen, for each key-value pair in the counts:\n\nif value is odd:\n\n   if cnt <1 \u2192 cnt +=1\n\n   else \u2192 set x to False and break.\n\nSo after processing all, if x is still True \u2192 then all counts are even except possibly one (since cnt can be 0 or 1). \n\nSo when x is True \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nElse (x is False):\n\n   if the length of the string is even \u2192 output \"Second\"\n\n   else \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nWait, why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is a game where players take turns removing characters, and the first player wins under certain conditions. The code's logic is based on the parity of character counts and the string length.\n\nBut regardless, the C code must replicate this logic.\n\nSo in C, the steps for the second part are:\n\nTake the first part's output (as a string), process it as follows:\n\n- Count the frequency of each character (case-sensitive? Probably, since Python is case-sensitive).\n\n- Check how many characters have odd counts.\n\n- If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1 \u2192 then output \"First\".\n\nWait, no, according to the code:\n\nIf x is True \u2192 which happens only if the number of odd counts is 0 or 1 \u2192 then output \"First\".\n\nElse (number of odd counts >=2):\n\n   if the length is even \u2192 output \"Second\"\n\n   else \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nWait, let me re-express the code's logic:\n\nThe code's variable 'x' is True unless there are two or more characters with odd counts. \n\nSo:\n\nif x is True \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nelse:\n\n   if the length is even \u2192 \"Second\"\n\n   else \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the second part's output depends on the counts and the length.\n\nNow, in C, to process the first part's output as the input string for the second part:\n\nWe need to generate the string from the first part's result (either \"-1\" or the LCM as a string). \n\nSo in C, after computing the first part's result (either -1 or LCM), we need to convert that into a string. \n\nFor example, if the first part's result is 12, then the string is \"12\".\n\nIf it's -1, then the string is \"-1\".\n\nSo in C, we can do something like:\n\nchar intermediate_str[20]; // enough to hold numbers up to N*M (assuming N and M are up to say 1e6, but even then, 1e12 would need 14 digits, plus sign. So 20 is enough).\n\nif (Flag) {\n\n    sprintf(intermediate_str, \"-1\");\n\n} else {\n\n    int lcm = (N * M) / gcd(N, M);\n\n    sprintf(intermediate_str, \"%d\", lcm);\n\n}\n\nThen, process this intermediate_str through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, processing the second part's logic in C:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in intermediate_str.\n\nWe can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) to count frequencies.\n\nInitialize an array count[256] = {0}.\n\nLoop through each character in intermediate_str:\n\ncount[c]++;\n\nThen, count how many characters have an odd count.\n\nint odd_count = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {\n\n        odd_count++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, based on odd_count and the length of the string:\n\nint len = strlen(intermediate_str);\n\nif (odd_count <= 1) {\n\n    printf(\"First\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    if (len % 2 == 0) {\n\n        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the code uses a loop over the dictionary items, and stops early if it finds a second odd count. So in C, the approach of counting all and then checking is equivalent, as long as the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, this should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNow, the C program structure:\n\nRead N, M, S, T.\n\nCompute first part's logic (Flag and LCM).\n\nGenerate intermediate_str.\n\nProcess intermediate_str through second part's logic.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: N=0 or M=0? Probably not, since in the problem, N and M are given as inputs to the first Python program, which uses them in division. So likely N and M are positive integers.\n\nEdge case 2: When the first part's output is \"-1\", then the second part's input is \"-1\", which has characters '-', '1', so counts: '-' once, '1' once. So two odd counts. The length is 2 (even). So the second part would output \"Second\".\n\nAnother example: if first part outputs \"12\", then counts are '1' and '2' each once \u2192 two odds. Length is even (2), so output \"Second\".\n\nIf first part outputs \"123\", then counts are 1,1,1 \u2192 three odds. Length is 3 (odd). So since odd_count is 3>1, then since length is odd \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the code, if odd_count is 3 (>=2), then:\n\nif length is even \u2192 second.\n\nElse (odd length) \u2192 first.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, coding steps in C.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\n// Function to compute GCD\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    char S[1000], T[1000];\n    char s_str[1000], t_str[1000]; // To hold the input strings after reading\n\n    // Read N and M\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n    // Read S and T, removing newlines\n    fgets(s_str, sizeof(s_str), stdin);\n    fgets(t_str, sizeof(t_str), stdin);\n\n    // Remove trailing newlines from S and T\n    s_str[strcspn(s_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n    t_str[strcspn(t_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    strcpy(S, s_str);\n    strcpy(T, t_str);\n\n    // Now process first part's logic\n    int Flag = 0;\n    int Kaburi_j_count = 0;\n    int Kaburi_j[1000]; // Assuming M is up to 1000, but need to adjust if needed\n    int Kaburi_i[1000];\n\n    // First, find all j's where j = (i*M)/N for some i, and j is integer\n    // We can use an array to track which j's are present\n    int present_j[M]; // indexes 0 to M-1\n    memset(present_j, 0, sizeof(present_j));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int temp = i * M;\n        if (temp % N == 0) {\n            int j = temp / N;\n            if (j >= 0 && j < M) { // j must be in 0..M-1\n                present_j[j] = 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Collect all j's where present_j[j] is 1\n    Kaburi_j_count = 0;\n    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {\n        if (present_j[j] == 1) {\n            Kaburi_j[Kaburi_j_count] = j;\n            Kaburi_i[Kaburi_j_count] = (j * N) / M; // since j = (i*M)/N \u2192 i = (j*N)/M\n            Kaburi_j_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now check all pairs\n    Flag = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < Kaburi_j_count; k++) {\n        int i = Kaburi_i[k];\n        int j = Kaburi_j[k];\n        if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n            Flag = 1;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compute LCM if needed\n    int lcm;\n    if (Flag == 0) {\n        int g = gcd(N, M);\n        lcm = (N * M) / g;\n    }\n\n    // Generate intermediate string\n    char intermediate_str[20];\n    if (Flag) {\n        strcpy(intermediate_str, \"-1\");\n    } else {\n        sprintf(intermediate_str, \"%d\", lcm);\n    }\n\n    // Now process second part's logic\n    int count[256] = {0};\n    int len = strlen(intermediate_str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = intermediate_str[i];\n        count[c]++;\n    }\n\n    int odd_count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {\n            odd_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (odd_count <= 1) {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    } else {\n        if (len % 2 == 0) {\n            printf(\"Second\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, when reading S and T, after using fgets, we need to ensure that the newline is stripped. The code uses strcspn to find the first occurrence of '\\n' and set it to '\\0'. That's correct.\n\nAlso, the Kaburi_j array's size is set to 1000, which may be too small if M is large. But given that in the first Python code, the Kaburi_j is built from M elements, so the maximum possible Kaburi_j_count is M. So if M is up to say 1e5, then 1000 is insufficient. But since the problem's constraints are not given, perhaps the test cases are small. Alternatively, we can use dynamic allocation, but in C, it's easier to use a fixed size. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the Kaburi_j_count is manageable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are such that N and M are small. Since the code is for a programming competition problem, perhaps the Kaburi_j array can be of size up to N, but in any case, the code as written may have a buffer overflow if M is large. But given that the user provided Python code uses lists, which can grow dynamically, but in C, we have to choose a size. Since the user's code may have M up to say 1e5, but in the problem's context, perhaps it's acceptable to use a larger array. Let me adjust the Kaburi_j and Kaburi_i arrays to be of size, say, 100000. But in the code above, I used 1000. Hmm, but in the code, the Kaburi_j_count is up to M, so if M is large, this could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are such that N and M are up to 1e5, but in that case, the array size would need to be that. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code as written is okay for the problem's test cases. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be adjusted to use dynamic arrays, but that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Kaburi_j array can be built on the fly, and the check can be done as we go, without storing all Kaburi_j and Kaburi_i. Let me think:\n\nInstead of storing all Kaburi_j and Kaburi_i, we can process each i and check if it's part of the Kaburi_i, then check the characters immediately. \n\nWait, the code in the first part's logic:\n\nThe Kaburi_j is the set of j's that are in the Number_iMN. So for each i, if (i*M) mod N ==0, then j = (i*M)/N is part of Kaburi_j. \n\nThen, for each such j, the corresponding i is (j*N)/M. \n\nBut when checking the characters, we need to check for all such pairs (i,j) whether S[i] == T[j]. \n\nAlternatively, instead of storing all Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j, we can loop over each i, check if (i*M) mod N ==0, then compute j = (i*M)/N, then check if S[i] == T[j]. \n\nWait, but that would be redundant because for each i, we can directly compute j and check. \n\nWait, but the original code in Python first collects all the j's (Kaburi_j) and then for each j in Kaburi_j, compute i = j*N/M, then check S[i] vs T[j]. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be rephrased as:\n\nfor each i in 0..N-1:\n\n   if (i*M) mod N ==0:\n\n       j = (i*M)/N\n\n       check S[i] vs T[j]\n\n       if any mismatch, set Flag=1 and break.\n\nThis way, we don't need to store all Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j arrays. \n\nThis would be more efficient and avoid the array size problem. \n\nAh, that's a better approach. Because in the original code, the Kaburi_i and Kaburi_j are used to loop through all the valid (i,j) pairs. But we can do this on the fly.\n\nSo in C, the code can be rewritten as:\n\nInitialize Flag to 0.\n\nLoop over each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   temp = i*M\n\n   if (temp % N ==0) {\n\n       j = temp / N;\n\n       if (j >=0 && j < M) { // which it is, but just to be safe\n\n           if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n\n               Flag =1;\n\n               break;\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nThis way, we don't need to store any arrays. \n\nThis is a much better approach. So the Kaburi_j and Kaburi_i arrays are not needed. \n\nThis simplifies the code and avoids array size issues. \n\nSo the first part's code can be rewritten as:\n\nFlag =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n    int temp = i*M;\n\n    if (temp % N ==0) {\n\n        int j = temp / N;\n\n        if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n\n            Flag =1;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis is much better. \n\nSo the code can be adjusted as such. \n\nThis is a crucial optimization. \n\nSo the revised code for the first part:\n\n// Process first part's logic\nint Flag = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    int temp = i * M;\n    if (temp % N == 0) {\n        int j = temp / N;\n        if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n            Flag = 1;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThen, compute LCM only if Flag is 0.\n\nThis is much better. \n\nSo the Kaburi arrays are not needed. \n\nThis is a big simplification. \n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    char S[1000], T[1000];\n    char s_str[1000], t_str[1000];\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n    fgets(s_str, sizeof(s_str), stdin);\n    fgets(t_str, sizeof(t_str), stdin);\n\n    s_str[strcspn(s_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n    t_str[strcspn(t_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    strcpy(S, s_str);\n    strcpy(T, t_str);\n\n    int Flag = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int temp = i * M;\n        if (temp % N == 0) {\n            int j = temp / N;\n            if (S[i] != T[j]) {\n                Flag = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    char intermediate_str[20];\n    if (Flag) {\n        strcpy(intermediate_str, \"-1\");\n    } else {\n        int g = gcd(N, M);\n        int lcm = (N * M) / g;\n        sprintf(intermediate_str, \"%d\", lcm);\n    }\n\n    int count[256] = {0};\n    int len = strlen(intermediate_str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = intermediate_str[i];\n        count[c]++;\n    }\n\n    int odd_count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {\n            odd_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (odd_count <= 1) {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    } else {\n        if (len % 2 == 0) {\n            printf(\"Second\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, the check is done for all i where (i*M) mod N ==0. For each such i, compute j and check S[i] vs T[j]. If any of them differ, Flag is set to 1. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nNow, testing this code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose N=2, M=2, S=\"ab\", T=\"cd\".\n\nThen for i=0: 0*2 mod 2 =0 \u2192 j=0. Check S[0] (a) vs T[0] (c) \u2192 not equal \u2192 Flag=1. So output is \"-1\".\n\nThen second part processes \"-1\" \u2192 counts: '-', '1' \u2192 two odds. Length is 2 (even). So output \"Second\".\n\nSample Output would be \"Second\".\n\nAnother test case where first part passes:\n\nN=2, M=2, S=\"ab\", T=\"ab\".\n\nThen for i=0: j=0 \u2192 a vs a \u2192 ok.\n\ni=1: 1*2 mod 2 =0 \u2192 j=1 \u2192 b vs b \u2192 ok. So Flag=0. LCM is (2*2)/2 =2 \u2192 \"2\".\n\nSecond part processes \"2\" \u2192 counts: '2' once \u2192 odd_count=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother test case where first part's output is \"123\".\n\nThen second part's input is \"123\" \u2192 counts 1,2,3 each once \u2192 odd_count=3. Length is 3 (odd). So output \"First\".\n\nAnother case where first part's output is \"12\" \u2192 counts 1 and 2 \u2192 two odds. Length even \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nThis code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The strings S and T may have length less than N or M? But according to the problem's first Python code, S and T are read as inputs, so their lengths are exactly N and M respectively. So in C, when reading S and T, we need to ensure that they are exactly N and M characters. But the code uses fgets, which may read up to the buffer size. However, the problem's input likely ensures that the strings are of correct length. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read exactly N and M characters. But in practice, the code uses the entire string read, which may be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is when N or M is zero, but the problem likely assumes they are positive.\n\nAnother point: in the first part's code, when computing j = temp / N, since temp is divisible by N, this is an integer. So no problem.\n\nThus, the final C code should be as above."
