  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It reads D and G from input, then reads D pairs of integers into PC. Then it loops through all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^D -1) to calculate some score and problem count. The goal is to find the minimum number of problems needed to reach at least G points. The answer is printed at the end.\n\nFile 2 takes an integer n, does a binary search to find l where l*(l+1)/2 is just less than n, then outputs n minus that value. Wait, but how does the output of File 1 feed into File 2?\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Python program's print(ans) is the input for the second program. So the C program must first compute the first part's answer, then use that as the input to the second part's computation, and output the final result.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input (D, G and PC), compute the first part's answer (ans), then take that ans as the n for the second part, compute the second part's result, and print that.\n\nTherefore, the C program structure will be:\n\nRead D and G, then read D pairs into an array.\n\nCompute the first part's answer (ans) as per the first code.\n\nThen, use that ans as the n for the second part's computation.\n\nThen compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nVariables in first Python file:\n\n- D and G are integers.\n\n- PC is a list of tuples. In C, probably an array of structs or two arrays. Let's see: each element in PC is a pair (a, b). So in C, perhaps an array of structs with two integers.\n\nWait, in the first code, for each j in 0..D-1, PC[j][0] and PC[j][1] are accessed. So in C, perhaps an array of structs:\n\nstruct PC_entry {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n};\n\nstruct PC_entry PC[D]; // but D is variable, so need dynamic allocation.\n\nWait, but in C, since D is read from input, we can't have a fixed size array. So need to read D first, then allocate memory for PC.\n\nHmm, but in the first Python code, D is the first input. So in C, first read D and G, then read D lines for PC.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead D and G from stdin.\n\nThen read D lines, each with two integers, storing into PC array.\n\nThen compute the ans variable as per the loop.\n\nNow, the loop in the first Python code is over all 2^D possible bitmasks. For each bitmask i (from 0 to 2^D -1), it checks each bit j. For each set bit, adds to the score and problem count.\n\nThen, if the total score is less than or equal to G, it checks the remaining points needed (left = G - score) and tries to find the minimal problem count by adding some problems from the unset bits.\n\nWait, the code in the first part:\n\nfor each i in 0..2^D-1:\n\n    compute score and problem by adding all the set bits' contributions.\n\n    if score > G: skip (since we need at least G, but adding more won't help?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code says if score > G, continue. So if the current bitmask's total score is already over G, then we don't need to consider adding more problems from other sections. Because adding more would only increase the score further, but the problem count would be higher. So in that case, this path is not useful for minimizing the problem count, so we skip.\n\nWait, but the code is trying to find the minimal number of problems needed to reach at least G. So if the current bitmask's score is already over G, then the problem count for that bitmask is a candidate. Wait, but the code skips it. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the code.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor each i (bitmask):\n\n    compute the score and problem count from the set bits.\n\n    if score > G: continue (so skip the rest of the loop for this i)\n\n    else:\n\n        then, we can try to see if adding some problems from the unset sections can get us to G with fewer problems.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe current bitmask's selected sections contribute to the score. If that's already over G, then the problem count is a candidate (since it's already sufficient). But the code skips that case. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first part of the loop (for j in 0..D-1) adds the full contribution of the sections where the bit is set. So for those sections, all PC[j][0] problems are taken, plus the bonus PC[j][1].\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nIn the first loop (for j in 0 to D-1):\n\nif (i >> j) &1 is true (bit is set), then:\n\nscore += 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]\n\nproblem += PC[j][0]\n\nAh, so when the bit is set, the entire PC[j][0] problems are taken from that section, plus the bonus. So the total score from that section is (number of problems * 100*(j+1)) plus the bonus.\n\nSo the total score is the sum of all those sections where the bit is set, plus their bonuses.\n\nThen, if the total score is already over G, then this path is sufficient (since it's over G), so the problem count is problem (sum of all PC[j][0] for set bits). But the code skips this case, so it's not considering it as a candidate. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nif the current score (from the set bits) is greater than G, then we can't improve by adding more problems from other sections (since those sections are not selected, so their problems are not taken). So the current problem count is a candidate for the minimal. But the code skips this case, so it's not considering it. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first part of the loop (the for j in 0..D-1) is for the set bits. The code then checks if the total score is greater than G. If so, then the problem count is a candidate (since it's already over G). But the code skips the rest of the processing (the loop over j again for the unset bits). So the code is not considering the problem count in this case. Wait, that's a mistake?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nif score > G:\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    then, we can try to add some problems from the unset sections to reach G, but with minimal problems.\n\nWait, but in the case where the current score is already over G, then the problem count is a valid candidate (since it's sufficient), so we should compare it to the current ans. But the code is not doing that. So perhaps the code is wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the code is correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires the minimal number of problems needed to reach at least G points. So if the current bitmask's score is already over G, then the problem count is a candidate. So in that case, we can consider the problem count as a possible minimum. But the code skips that case, so it's not considering it. That would be a bug.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first part of the loop (for j in 0..D-1) adds all the problems from the set bits. So the score is the total from those sections. If that's already over G, then the problem count is the sum of those sections' PC[j][0]. So that's a valid candidate. But the code skips this case, so it's not considering it. So the code is wrong?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the code's 'continue' skips the rest of the code in the loop for this i. So the code after the if (score > G) is skipped. So in the case where the score is over G, the code does not do anything else. So the problem count is not considered as a candidate. That would be a problem.\n\nWait, but the code's ans is initialized to 1e9. So in the case where the score is over G, the problem count is a candidate, but the code is not updating ans. So that's a bug in the code?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the code is structured so that when the score is over G, the problem count is a candidate, but the code is not considering it. So the code is wrong. But perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the problems from the unset sections to reach exactly G, but in that case, the code is not considering the case where the initial score is over G.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose D=1, G=100. PC has (1,0). So the first section has 1 problem, and bonus 0. So if the bitmask is set (i=1), then the score is 100*1*1 +0 = 100, which is exactly G. So the problem count is 1. So ans would be 1. But if the code skips the case where score is exactly G, then it would not consider it. Wait, but in the code, the condition is 'if score > G: continue'. So if score is exactly G, then it proceeds to the else part. So in that case, the code would proceed to check the unset bits (but there are none, since the bit is set). So the code would not add anything else, but the problem count is 1, which is a candidate. But the code would not have considered it yet. Wait, the code's ans is only updated in the part where it checks the unset bits. So in the case where the initial score is exactly G, then the code would proceed to the else part, but then in the loop over j again (for the unset bits), but since all bits are set, there are no unset bits. So the code would not update ans. So the problem count (1) would not be considered. So the code is wrong?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's requirements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the problems from the unset sections. Wait, no. The code's first part is taking all the problems from the set sections. The unset sections can contribute some problems, but only up to their PC[j][0]?\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first part of the loop (for j in 0..D-1) is for the set bits. Those sections contribute all their problems (PC[j][0] problems) plus the bonus. The unset bits are not contributing anything except possibly some problems from them to reach the remaining points.\n\nWait, the code's second loop (after the first if) is for the unset bits. For each unset bit j, the code considers adding some of the problems from that section to reach the remaining points (left = G - score). The idea is that for the unset sections, you can take some of their problems (but not all, since the section's bonus is only added if you take all). Wait, no, the bonus is only added when you take all the problems in the section. So for the unset sections, you can take some of their problems (without the bonus) to get additional points.\n\nWait, the problem's description (from the first code's context) must be that each section j has PC[j][0] problems, and a bonus PC[j][1]. If you take all PC[j][0] problems from section j, you get 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1] points. If you take fewer than that, you get 100*(j+1)*k points, where k is the number taken, but no bonus. So the code's logic is that for the unset bits (sections not taken fully), you can take some of their problems to reach the remaining points needed (left = G - score). The minimal number of problems added would be the minimal between the remaining points divided by the per-problem points (100*(j+1)), but not exceeding the total available in that section (PC[j][0]).\n\nWait, the code's second loop is over the unset bits (since it skips the set bits). For each such j (unset), the code checks if the remaining points (left) can be covered by taking some of the problems from that section. The maximum possible points from that section is 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0], but since it's not taken fully, the bonus isn't added. So the code calculates how many problems (tmp) are needed from that section to cover the remaining points. The minimal between tmp and PC[j][0] (since you can't take more than available). Then, the total problem count would be problem (from the set bits) plus tmp. The minimal of all such possibilities is considered for ans.\n\nAh, so the code's logic is that for the current bitmask, the set bits contribute their full points (including bonus), and the unset bits can contribute some partial points (without bonus) to reach the target. The minimal problem count is the sum of the set bits' problems plus the minimal needed from the unset bits.\n\nBut in the case where the initial score (from set bits) is already over G, then the problem count (sum of set bits' problems) is a valid candidate. However, the code skips this case (because it's over G), so it doesn't consider it. That's a problem. So the code is incorrect?\n\nWait, the problem requires that the total score is at least G. So if the initial score is over G, then the problem count is a valid candidate. The code is not considering that case, so it's wrong. But perhaps the code is correct because the problem allows taking some of the unset sections' problems to reduce the total?\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, taking fewer problems from the set sections would give a lower problem count. But the code is considering all possible subsets (bitmask) of the sections. So the case where the set bits' total is over G is a valid candidate, and should be considered. The code is not considering it, so it's a bug.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the unset sections' problems, but in the case where the set bits already give over G, you can choose not to take any of the unset sections, so the problem count is the sum of the set bits' problems. But the code is not considering that case because it skips when the initial score is over G. So the code is wrong.\n\nWait, the code's first condition is:\n\nif score > G: continue\n\nSo in that case, the code skips the rest of the processing for this i. So the problem count (sum of set bits' problems) is not considered as a candidate. So the code is wrong. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the unset sections' problems to reduce the total? No, that's not possible. The problem is to choose a subset of the sections (each either taken fully or not) plus possibly some problems from other sections (not taken fully) to reach at least G points with minimal problems.\n\nWait, the problem's description (from the first code's context) must be that each section can be either fully taken (all problems plus bonus) or not taken at all. Wait, no, perhaps the problem allows taking some of the problems from a section without taking all, but then you don't get the bonus. So the code's logic is that for the unset sections, you can take some of their problems (without the bonus) to reach the remaining points. But the set sections contribute their full points (including bonus). So the code's logic is correct in that case.\n\nWait, but in the case where the set bits' total is already over G, then the problem count is the sum of their problems, which is a valid candidate. The code is not considering that because it skips the case where score > G. So the code is wrong. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the unset sections' problems, but in that case, the code's logic is that the initial score (from set bits) plus the partial from unset can reach G. But if the initial score is already over G, then you can choose to not take any of the unset sections, so the problem count is the sum of the set bits' problems. So that should be considered as a candidate. But the code skips that case, so it's not considered. So the code is wrong.\n\nThis is a problem. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's logic. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code's first loop (for each i) computes the score and problem count from the set bits. Then, if the score is over G, it skips the rest. Else, it tries to add some problems from the unset bits to reach G. The ans is updated only in the case where the initial score is less than or equal to G, and then adding some from the unset bits can reach G. But in the case where the initial score is over G, the problem count is a valid candidate, but it's not considered. So the code is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the unset sections' problems, but in that case, the initial score (over G) can be a candidate. So the code is missing that case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that you can choose to take some of the unset sections' problems, but in that case, the initial score (over G) can be a candidate. So the code is wrong. Therefore, the code may have a bug, but since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is, even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo, assuming the code is correct as given, I have to proceed.\n\nNow, moving on to translating the first part into C.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nD and G are integers.\n\nPC is an array of D elements, each with two integers (a and b).\n\nThe loop over i from 0 to 2^D -1.\n\nBut 2^D can be up to 2^20 (if D is 20), which is manageable? Well, for D up to 20, 2^20 is about a million, which is okay. But if D is larger, like 30, it's 1e9 which is too big. But perhaps the problem constraints limit D to a small number.\n\nAssuming D is manageable.\n\nIn C, the loop would be for (i=0; i < (1 << D); i++).\n\nThen, for each i, compute score and problem.\n\nInitialize score and problem to 0 each time.\n\nThen, for each j from 0 to D-1:\n\nif (i & (1 << j)) is true (bit j is set), then add 100*(j+1)*PC[j].a + PC[j].b to score, and add PC[j].a to problem.\n\nWait, in Python, the loop is for j in range(D), so j from 0 to D-1. So in C, same.\n\nThen, after computing score and problem, check if score > G. If yes, continue (skip the rest).\n\nElse, compute left = G - score.\n\nThen, loop over j again (for all j from 0 to D-1):\n\nif (i & (1 << j)) is set (bit is set), then skip (since we can't take more from that section).\n\nElse:\n\nthe current section is not taken (so can take some of its problems).\n\nThe maximum possible points from this section is 100*(j+1)*k, where k is the number of problems taken (up to PC[j].a).\n\nWe need to cover 'left' points. So the minimal k needed is ceil(left / (100*(j+1))).\n\nBut since we can take up to PC[j].a problems, the minimal k is min(ceil(left / (100*(j+1))), PC[j].a).\n\nWait, the code in Python does:\n\nif left > 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]:\n\nWait, no, the code's code is:\n\nif left > 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]:\n\n    pass\n\nelse:\n\n    tmp = (left + (100*(j+1)) -1) // (100*(j+1))\n\n    ans = min(ans, problem + min(tmp, PC[j][0]))\n\nWait, but the bonus is not added here because the section is not taken (since it's unset). So the maximum points from this section is 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0], but the code's condition is comparing left to (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]). That seems wrong, because the bonus is not part of the points when the section is not taken.\n\nAh, that's a mistake in the code. Because the bonus is only added when the section is taken (bit set). So in the unset case, the maximum points from that section is 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0], but the code is adding the bonus. So the code is wrong here.\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]):\n\n    pass\n\nelse:\n\n    compute tmp.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the bonus is not part of the points when the section is not taken. So the maximum possible points from that section is 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0], so the code's condition should be comparing left to 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0].\n\nTherefore, the code has a bug here. But since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is, even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo proceeding with the code as written.\n\nSo in the code's second loop over j (for the unset bits):\n\nif (i has the bit set for j) \u2192 skip.\n\nElse:\n\nif left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]) \u2192 then even taking all the problems from this section (including the bonus?) but since it's not taken, the bonus isn't added. So the code's condition is wrong, but I have to follow it.\n\nWait, the code's condition is checking if left is greater than the total possible from that section (including the bonus). But since the section is not taken (bit not set), the bonus is not part of the points. So the code's condition is wrong. But again, I have to translate it as is.\n\nSo in the code's logic, if the left is greater than the total possible (including bonus) from that section, then we can't get enough points from it, so skip. Else, compute the minimal tmp.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1])) \u2192 then can't get enough, so pass.\n\nElse:\n\ntmp = ceil(left / (100*(j+1))) \u2192 which is (left + (100*(j+1) -1 )) / (100*(j+1)).\n\nThen, the minimal between tmp and PC[j][0], since you can't take more than PC[j][0] problems.\n\nThen, the total problem count would be problem + tmp. So ans is the minimum between ans and that.\n\nSo the code's logic is that for each unset section, if the section can contribute enough points (even with the bonus, which it shouldn't), then compute the minimal tmp.\n\nBut regardless, I have to translate this as per the code.\n\nNow, moving to the second Python file.\n\nThe second code takes n as input (which is the output of the first code's ans). Then it does a binary search to find l where l*(l+1)/2 is the largest value less than or equal to n. Then the result is n - l*(l+1)/2.\n\nWait, the code in the second file:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = 1, r = n.\n\nLoop while l < r:\n\nmid = (l + r) // 2 (but in Python, it's integer division).\n\nWait, the code uses mid = l + (r - l) // 2 \u2192 same as (l + r) // 2.\n\nThen idxcnt = mid*(mid+1)/2 \u2192 but in Python, division is float, but since mid is integer, it's a float. But in the code, the comparison is with n (integer). But since idxcnt is a float, but the code uses integer division?\n\nWait, the code's idxcnt is mid*(mid+1)/2 \u2192 which is a float if mid is even or odd. But in the code, the condition is if idxcnt < n \u2192 so if the mid's value is less than n, then l is set to mid+1. Else, r is set to mid.\n\nWait, but the code is trying to find the maximum l where l*(l+1)/2 \u2264 n. The binary search is to find the largest l where this holds.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nInitially l=1, r =n.\n\nWhile l < r:\n\nmid = (l + r +1) // 2? Wait, no, mid is l + (r-l)//2 \u2192 which is the same as (l + r) // 2.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile l < r:\n\n    mid = l + (r - l) // 2 \u2192 which is (l + r) // 2.\n\n    idxcnt = mid*(mid+1)/2 \u2192 which is a float.\n\n    if idxcnt < n \u2192 then set l = mid +1.\n\n    else \u2192 set r = mid.\n\nAt the end, l is the value where l*(l+1)/2 is the first exceeding n? Or the last one that is less?\n\nWait, let's see an example. Suppose n=3.\n\nWe need to find l where l*(l+1)/2 \u22643.\n\nPossible l:\n\nl=2 \u2192 3 \u2192 which is equal to 3 \u2192 so l=2 is acceptable.\n\nThe code's process:\n\nInitially l=1, r=3.\n\nmid = (1+3)/2 = 2 \u2192 mid=2.\n\nidxcnt = 2*3/2 =3 \u2192 which is equal to n \u2192 so since idxcnt is not less than n, set r=2.\n\nNow l=1, r=2.\n\nmid = (1+2)/2 =1.5 \u2192 but in integer division, (1+2)//2 =1.\n\nmid=1 \u2192 idxcnt =1*2/2 =1 <3 \u2192 so set l=2.\n\nNow l=2, r=2 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThen l is 2. So the code's l is correct.\n\nThen, the code does l -=1 \u2192 wait, why?\n\nWait, after the loop, the code does l -=1?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter the loop, the code does:\n\nl -=1\n\nidxcnt = l*(l+1)/2\n\nprint(n - idxcnt)\n\nWait, why subtract 1?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum l where l*(l+1)/2 \u2264n. Let's see.\n\nIn the example above, after the loop, l is 2. So l*(l+1)/2 is exactly 3, which is equal to n. So the code's l is correct. But then l -=1 \u2192 l becomes 1. Then idxcnt is 1*2/2 =1. So the result is 3-1=2. But the correct answer should be 0 (since 3-3=0). So this is wrong.\n\nAh, so the code has a bug here. The code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's see the code again:\n\nThe code's final steps:\n\nAfter the loop, l is the value where l*(l+1)/2 is the first exceeding n? Or the maximum l where it's less than or equal?\n\nWait, let's see the code's loop:\n\nThe loop is while l < r:\n\nmid = (l + r) // 2.\n\nif idxcnt < n \u2192 then l = mid +1.\n\nElse \u2192 r = mid.\n\nThis is a standard binary search for the first l where idxcnt >=n. So after the loop, l is the minimal l where idxcnt >=n. So the maximum l where idxcnt <n is l-1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=3.\n\nThe loop ends with l=2 (since mid=2 gives idxcnt=3 which is equal to n \u2192 so r becomes 2, loop ends. So l is 2. The maximum l where idxcnt <=n is 2. So the code's l is correct. But then the code subtracts 1, making it 1, which is wrong.\n\nAh, so the code is wrong here. The code's final steps are incorrect. The correct l is the one found, but the code subtracts 1, leading to an error.\n\nSo the code is incorrect. But again, I have to translate it as is.\n\nThe code's final steps:\n\nAfter the loop, l is the minimal value where idxcnt >=n. So the maximum l where idxcnt <n is l-1. So the code's l -=1 is correct for that. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=3.\n\nThe correct l (the maximum where idxcnt <=n) is 2. The code's loop ends with l=2. Then l -=1 \u2192 l=1. So the code computes idxcnt as 1*2/2 =1 \u2192 3-1=2, which is wrong. The correct answer should be 0.\n\nHmm, so the code is wrong here. So the code's logic is incorrect. But since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nThe second code's problem: given n, find the number of remaining after the largest triangular number less than or equal to n.\n\nThe triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, etc. For n=3, the largest triangular number is 3 \u2192 remainder 0. For n=4, it's 3 \u2192 remainder 1.\n\nThe code's approach is to find l such that l*(l+1)/2 is the first exceeding n, then subtract 1. But the code's loop finds l as the first where it's >=n, so l-1 is the last one below.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=3:\n\nThe loop ends with l=2 (since mid=2 gives exactly 3). So l is 2. Then l -=1 \u2192 1. So the code computes 1*(2)/2 =1 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 wrong.\n\nAh, so the code is wrong. The correct l is 2, so the code should not subtract 1. So the code has a bug here.\n\nBut since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is, even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo the code's final steps are:\n\nAfter the loop, l is the minimal value where idxcnt >=n. So the maximum l where idxcnt <n is l-1. So the code's l -=1 is correct for that. But in the example, that gives the wrong result. So perhaps the problem requires the remainder when subtracting the largest triangular number less than or equal to n. So in the example, the code's answer is wrong. But I have to proceed.\n\nNow, translating the second code into C.\n\nThe second code's variables:\n\nn is read from input (which is the first code's ans).\n\nThen l starts at 1, r at n.\n\nLoop while l < r:\n\nmid = l + (r - l)/2 (integer division).\n\nidxcnt = mid*(mid+1)/2 \u2192 but in C, this is (mid * (mid+1)) / 2. Since mid is integer, this is okay.\n\nWait, in Python, division is float, but in C, it's integer division. Wait, in the code, the code uses division by 2, but in C, if mid is even or odd, it's okay. Wait, in the code, the code uses mid*(mid+1)/2 \u2192 which in C would be (mid*(mid+1))/2. So for even mid, it's okay. For odd mid, (mid+1) is even, so the product is even.\n\nSo in C, the code can compute idxcnt as (mid * (mid +1)) / 2.\n\nThen, if idxcnt < n \u2192 set l = mid +1.\n\nElse \u2192 set r = mid.\n\nAfter the loop, l is set to l-1.\n\nThen compute idxcnt = l*(l+1)/2 \u2192 (l*(l+1))/2.\n\nThe result is n - idxcnt.\n\nSo the code's final print is that.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a single C program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read D and G from stdin.\n\n2. Read D lines of two integers each into PC array.\n\n3. Compute the first part's ans as per the first code.\n\n4. Use that ans as n for the second part.\n\n5. Compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, in C code:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read D and G. Then read D pairs into an array.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nstruct PC_entry {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    int D, G;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n    struct PC_entry PC[D]; // variable length array (VLA), allowed in C99.\n\n    for (int i =0; i < D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[i].a, &PC[i].b);\n    }\n\n    // Compute first part's ans.\n\n    int ans = 1e9; // but in C, 1e9 is a double. So use 1000000000.\n\n    for (int i=0; i < (1 << D); i++) {\n        int score =0, problem =0;\n        for (int j=0; j < D; j++) {\n            if (i & (1 << j)) {\n                score += 100*(j+1)*PC[j].a + PC[j].b;\n                problem += PC[j].a;\n            }\n        }\n        if (score > G) continue;\n        int left = G - score;\n        for (int j=0; j < D; j++) {\n            if (i & (1 << j)) continue;\n            // Check if the section can contribute to left.\n            int max_possible = 100*(j+1)*PC[j].a + PC[j].b; // according to the code's mistake.\n            if (left > max_possible) continue;\n            int tmp = (left + (100*(j+1) -1 )) / (100*(j+1));\n            tmp = tmp < PC[j].a ? tmp : PC[j].a;\n            ans = ans < (problem + tmp) ? ans : (problem + tmp);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now, compute the second part using ans as n.\n\n    int n = ans;\n    int l =1, r =n;\n    while (l < r) {\n        int mid = l + (r - l)/2;\n        int idxcnt = mid*(mid+1)/2;\n        if (idxcnt < n) {\n            l = mid +1;\n        } else {\n            r = mid;\n        }\n    }\n    l--;\n    int idxcnt = l*(l+1)/2;\n    int result = n - idxcnt;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but there are a few things to check:\n\n- The first part's loop over i: for (i from 0 to (1<<D)-1). The loop in C is written as for (i=0; i < (1 << D); i++) \u2192 correct.\n\n- The calculation of max_possible in the second loop (for j in unset bits):\n\nThe code uses PC[j].a and PC[j].b. The code's condition is if left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j].a + PC[j].b) \u2192 which is the same as the Python code's mistake.\n\n- The tmp calculation: (left + (100*(j+1) -1 )) / (100*(j+1)) \u2192 integer division.\n\n- The ans is initialized to 1e9 \u2192 in C, 1000000000 is better.\n\n- The second part's code:\n\nThe loop for binary search is correct as per the code's logic.\n\nWait, in the second part's code, after the loop, l is set to l-1. Then compute idxcnt as l*(l+1)/2 \u2192 which is the triangular number for l-1?\n\nWait, after the loop, l is the minimal value where mid*(mid+1)/2 >=n. So l-1 is the last one below.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct as per the code's intention, even if it's wrong for the problem.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The first part's ans may be 1e9 (if no solution found?), but in the second part, n is set to that. But the second code's binary search would have r = 1e9, which is a problem for large D. But the problem's constraints may limit D such that the first part's ans is reasonable.\n\n- The code uses variable-length arrays (VLA) for PC. If D is large (like 1e5), this could cause stack overflow. But assuming the problem constraints are small, this is okay.\n\n- The first part's loop over 2^D may be too slow for D=20 (1 million iterations). But again, assuming D is small.\n\nNow, testing with the first example where D=1, G=100, PC[0] = (1,0):\n\nFirst part's ans:\n\nLoop over i=0 and 1.\n\ni=0 (no bits set):\n\nscore =0, problem=0.\n\nleft =100-0=100.\n\nCheck j=0 (unset):\n\nmax_possible = 100*(1)*1 +0 =100 \u2192 left (100) is equal to max_possible \u2192 so proceed.\n\ntmp = (100 + 100-1)/100 \u2192 (199)/100 \u2192 1.99 \u2192 1 (since integer division). But PC[j].a is 1 \u2192 tmp is 1.\n\nSo problem + tmp =0+1=1 \u2192 ans is min(1e9, 1) \u2192 1.\n\ni=1 (bit set):\n\nscore =100*1*1 +0 =100 \u2192 which is equal to G \u2192 so score is not > G \u2192 proceed.\n\nleft =0.\n\nThen loop over j=0 (set bit \u2192 skipped).\n\nSo no changes to ans. So ans remains 1.\n\nThen the second part's n is 1.\n\nSecond part's code:\n\nl=1, r=1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nl is set to 0.\n\nidxcnt =0*1/2 =0 \u2192 result is 1-0=1.\n\nWait, but the correct answer for the second part when n=1 should be 0 (since 1 is the first triangular number). The code's result is 1, which is wrong. But according to the code's logic, it's correct as per the code's mistake.\n\nHmm, but in the example, the first part's ans is 1, so the second code's input is 1.\n\nThe code's process:\n\nl starts at 1, r=1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nThen l is set to 0.\n\nidxcnt is 0 \u2192 1-0=1. So the code outputs 1, but the correct answer should be 0.\n\nThis shows the code's bug. But since I have to translate it as is, the code will have that bug.\n\nThus, the C code as written will have the same bugs as the original Python code.\n\nTherefore, the final C code is as above."
