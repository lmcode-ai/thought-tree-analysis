Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second Python code.\n\nWait the second Python code is:\n\nprint(input().replace(\",\", \" \"))\n\nSo it takes the input (which is the output of the first program) and replaces commas with spaces. But if the first program's output has no commas, then the second step's output is the same as the first's output. But why would the first program's output have commas? Because the first program's input could have commas, but the first program only keeps 0/1 and B. So the first program's output would not have commas. So the second step's replace would do nothing. Hmm, maybe the first program's output is passed to the second, which replaces commas with spaces. But if the first program's output has no commas, then the second step's output is same as first's. But perhaps the first program's input could have commas, but they are filtered out. So the second step is redundant in that case. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so I have to do both steps even if they seem redundant.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output could have commas if the input had them but they were not filtered? Wait no, the first program only appends 0 or 1. So the first program's output can't have commas. So the second step's replace would do nothing. But the problem says to translate the sequence, so I have to do both steps regardless.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first program's output is passed to the second, which replaces commas with spaces. So in the C code, after processing the first step, the result is stored, then the second step is applied to that string.\n\nSo the steps in C would be:\n\n1. Read the input into a buffer.\n\n2. Process the first step (build the string with 0/1 and B handling).\n\n3. Then process the second step (replace commas with spaces in the resulting string from step 2).\n\nThen output the final string.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\n- Read the input into a char array (input_str). Let's say using fgets, but need to handle the size. Let's assume the input is not too big.\n\n- Process the first step's logic to build the processed_str.\n\n- Then process the second step on that processed_str to get the final_str.\n\n- Then print final_str.\n\nNow, let's think about the first step's processing.\n\nThe first step's processing can be done with a buffer. Let's say we have a buffer for the processed string. Let's use a dynamic approach. Let's have an array, say, processed_str, with a current length. Let's start with an empty string.\n\nInitialize an array, say, processed_str of size, say, 1000 (or some max size). The index starts at 0.\n\nLoop through each character in the input_str:\n\nfor each c in input_str:\n\n   if c is '0' or '1':\n\n       add to processed_str at index, then index +=1\n\n   else if c is 'B' and index >0:\n\n       index -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       ignore.\n\nWait, but how to loop through the input_str? The input_str is a null-terminated string. So loop until the null terminator.\n\nWait, but in C, the input_str would be read with fgets, which includes the newline. Hmm, but the first Python code uses input(), which in Python reads until the newline and strips the trailing newline. So in C, perhaps we should read the line and remove the newline.\n\nSo first, read the input into a buffer. Let's say:\n\nchar input_str[10000]; // assuming input is up to 10000 characters.\n\nfgets(input_str, sizeof(input_str), stdin);\n\nThen, remove the trailing newline if present.\n\ninput_str[strcspn(input_str, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\nThen process each character in input_str.\n\nNow, for the processed_str array. Let's have a buffer of the same size as input_str, but maybe even bigger? Or perhaps the maximum possible length is the same as the input length (since B can only remove characters). So let's use a buffer of the same size as input_str.\n\nchar processed_str[10000]; // same size as input_str.\n\nint index =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; input_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    char c = input_str[i];\n\n    if (c == '0' || c == '1') {\n\n        processed_str[index++] = c;\n\n    } else if (c == 'B' && index >0) {\n\n        index--;\n\n    }\n\n    // else ignore.\n\n}\n\nprocessed_str[index] = '\\0'; // null terminate.\n\nThen, the second step is to replace commas with spaces in this processed_str.\n\nWait, but according to the second Python code, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is processed_str. So the second step is to take that string and replace any commas with spaces. But in the first step's processing, commas are not added to processed_str. Because the first step only adds 0 or 1. So the processed_str would have no commas. So the second step would do nothing. But the problem requires us to do exactly the same steps as the original code, so even if it's redundant, we have to do it.\n\nSo in the second step, we need to process the processed_str, replacing commas with spaces.\n\nSo create another buffer for the final_str.\n\nchar final_str[10000];\n\nint final_index =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; processed_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    char c = processed_str[i];\n\n    if (c == ',') {\n\n        final_str[final_index++] = ' ';\n\n    } else {\n\n        final_str[final_index++] = c;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nfinal_str[final_index] = '\\0';\n\nThen print final_str.\n\nWait, but in the second Python code, the entire string is replaced. So in C, the code above does exactly that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program would read the input, process the first step, then process the second step, then print the result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char input_str[10000];\n    fgets(input_str, sizeof(input_str), stdin);\n    input_str[strcspn(input_str, \"\\n\")] = 0; // remove newline\n\n    // Process first step\n    char processed_str[10000];\n    int index = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; input_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = input_str[i];\n        if (c == '0' || c == '1') {\n            processed_str[index++] = c;\n        } else if (c == 'B' && index > 0) {\n            index--;\n        }\n    }\n    processed_str[index] = '\\0';\n\n    // Process second step: replace commas with spaces\n    char final_str[10000];\n    int final_index = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; processed_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = processed_str[i];\n        if (c == ',') {\n            final_str[final_index++] = ' ';\n        } else {\n            final_str[final_index++] = c;\n        }\n    }\n    final_str[final_index] = '\\0';\n\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", final_str);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first step, the processed_str is built correctly. The second step's processing is replacing commas with spaces. But since the first step's processed_str can't have commas, the second step's output is same as first's. But the problem requires us to do exactly the same steps as the original code, so even if it's redundant, it's okay.\n\nWait, but maybe the first step's input could have commas, but the first step's processing ignores them. So the first step's output has no commas, so the second step's replace does nothing. But the code still has to do that step.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose input is \"0B1,2\".\n\nFirst step processing:\n\nThe input is \"0B1,2\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\n0: add to processed_str (now \"0\", index 1)\n\nB: since index is 1, subtract to 0.\n\n1: add (now \"1\", index 1)\n\n, : ignored (since not 0/1/B?)\n\nWait, the comma is not 0 or 1, so it's ignored. The '2' is also not 0/1, so ignored. So processed_str is \"1\".\n\nThen the second step replaces commas in \"1\" (none), so output is \"1\".\n\nWhich matches the original code's behavior.\n\nAnother test case: input is \"0,1B\".\n\nFirst step:\n\n0 is added (index 1).\n\n, is ignored.\n\n1 is added (index 2).\n\nB: since index is 2, subtract to 1. So processed_str is \"0\".\n\nSecond step: replace commas in \"0\" \u2192 still \"0\".\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case where the first step's output has a comma? Wait, no. Because the first step only adds 0 or 1. So the second step's replace is redundant, but the code still does it.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible buffer overflows. The input_str is 10000, which is big enough. The processed_str is also 10000. The maximum possible length of processed_str is the number of 0/1 in the input, which can't exceed the input length. So 10000 is okay.\n\nThe final_str is also 10000, which is same as processed_str's max length. So that's okay.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nTest when input is \"B\": the first step's processed_str is empty string. Then second step leaves it as empty. So output is empty line.\n\nAnother case: input is \"0B\", then processed_str is empty. Output is empty.\n\nAnother case: input is \"0123B\", then after processing:\n\n0 is added (index1), 1 (2), 2 (ignored), 3 (ignored), B (index 1). So processed_str is \"0\".\n\nSecond step: no commas, so output \"0\".\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work."
