Since x is 0 or 1, so adding '0' to it to get a character. \n\nInitialize a buffer, perhaps, with enough space. Let's think: since the number can be up to 2^31 (since in C, int can be 32 bits), but the code might be handling an unsigned, but let's see the original code uses int, but in C, if the input n is positive, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum bits needed for n is log2(max int). Let's say 32 bits maximum. \n\nAlternatively, dynamically build a string. \n\nPossible steps in C:\n\nInitialize an empty string (array), and for each iteration, get x, append the character (as x+'0'). \n\nBut in C, we can use a buffer like char s[33], as 32 bits. \n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    // Initialize a buffer to collect the bits as characters.\n    char s[32]; // Or maybe 33 for possible overflow? Let's think maximum bits. Let's say 32 bits, so array of size 32 is enough, since for n=2^31, but in Java, n is an int which can be up to 2^31-1, but in C, maybe similarly.\n\nWait, perhaps the length needed is up to the number of bits.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nStart with an index i set to 0, and for each bit, append to the array.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nInitialize an array:\n\nchar s[1024] = {0}; // arbitrary buffer, but make sure it's large enough.\n\nint index =0;\n\nloop until n is 0:\n\nx = n%2;\n\ns[index] = '0' +x;\n\nindex++;\n\nn /=2;\n\n}\n\nThen, s is filled with the LSB first. So the array contains the binary digits in reverse order (LSB first), but again, the count is unaffected. \n\nBut then after that, the string is null-terminated? Wait, since C strings are null-terminated. So, after filling the array, perhaps:\n\ns[index] = '\\0';\n\nThen, the array s is a string. But in this approach, maybe I need to use more dynamic handling, but with a static array. Alternatively:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the string is created as an empty string and characters are appended to it. But in C, we can pre-allocate an array with enough size, say up to 32 bits. The maximum bits needed for an integer. Let's say for numbers up to 2^30, so 31 bits. Let me make it 32+1 bytes (since the string must be null-terminated). \n\nAlternatively, even for n=0, but in the code, the loop runs while n > 0, so if the user inputs 0, it would not execute and the string remains empty. But according to code's logic, but let's see the java code: in such a case (n=0) the string is empty, and the code would print 0. Let's check what happens in the Java code when n=0. The loop does not execute. The answer variable then starts at zero, and the for loop over s's length (0) does not run. Then it prints 0, which is correct. \n\nIn C, if n is zero, the same handling is needed. \n\nSo, perhaps in steps:\n\nInitialize the array s as:\n\nchar s[32]; // Let's assume 32 bits maximum.\n\nWait, but if the array is 32 elements, then when we have index 0..31, after loop, we need to terminate with null. So:\n\ns[0... index-1] has the characters, then s[index] = '\\0'? So the array's maximum size is 32+1. So better to declare as 33 elements. \n\nSo:\n\nchar s[33]; \n\nInitialize index to zero. \n\nthen after processing:\n\ns[index] = '\\0';\n\nso, in the code:\n\nint main() {\n\n  int n;\n\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n  // process bits and store in s\n\n  char s[33]; // enough for 32 bits + null.\n\n  int idx =0;\n\n  do {\n\n      int x = n %2;\n\n      s[idx] = '0' +x;\n\n      idx++;\n\n      n = n/2;\n\n  } while (n >0);\n\n  s[idx]= '\\0'; // terminate the string.\n\n  // Now count the '1's in the string.\n\n  int ans =0;\n\n  for(int i=0; i < idx; i++) {\n\n      if (s[i] == '1') ans++;\n\n  }\n\n  printf(\"%d\", ans);\n\n  return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop condition in Java is while(n >0). So in the C code, that's the same, so the do-while might not be needed. Because in C, we can do the same with:\n\n while (n >0) {\n\n    process steps;\n\n }\n\nWait, the loop in Java:\n\nwhile loop starts with the condition n>0; inside the loop:\n\nn is divided by 2 each time. So the loop stops when n becomes zero. \n\nSo the code in C can be:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\",&n);\n\n    char s[33];\n\n    int idx=0;\n\n    while (n >0) {\n\n        int x = n%2;\n\n        s[idx] = '0' +x;\n\n        idx++;\n\n        n /=2;\n\n    }\n\n    s[idx] = 0; // NUL-terminator.\n\n    // count the number of '1's in s.\n\n    int ans=0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i<idx; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == '1') ans++;\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, the original code uses a string which is built by appending the x each time (as String) but String in Java is immutable, so each append creates a new String, but in C we can just build the array step by step.\n\nThis should work. However, there is another way to count the 1s without building the string. Because the problem's count is just the number of times remainder 1 was encountered. So why not just count during the loop?\n\nLike, \n\nint ans = 0;\n\nwhile(n >0){\n\n    x = n%2;\n\n    if(x ==1) ans++;\n\n    n /=2;\n\n}\n\nThis would be more efficient and simpler. But since the problem says to translate the code, which uses the string approach. So following that, better to stick with the same steps as per the Java code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code has a problem with the order. Wait, no. Because the count is the total 1 bits, so the order of processing the bits doesn't affect the count. \n\nBut according to the user's request, the code must be a translation of the Java code's logic. So building the string and then scanning for '1's is required.\n\nAlternatively, the C code would be similar as above. Let me check edge cases.\n\nTest with n=3. Binary is 11. The loop:\n\nFirst iteration: n=3: x=1 \u2192 added. n becomes 1. next iteration: x=1 \u2192 added. n becomes 0. So the string has '1' '1', which will count 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother test case n=0: The while loop doesn't execute \u2192 string is empty, so ans 0.\n\nAnother test case n=1: the string is '1', count is 1.\n\nSo the code works. Now, the code in C uses a buffer of size 33. For numbers up to 2^32, but in C, an int can be 2's complement, but the code should process positive n as in the original Java. Since the code uses n>0 to loop, so if the user inputs a negative value, this loop will not run, and the count would be 0, which may not be intended. But the original Java code would also do that. Wait Java's int is 32 bits two's complement, so if n is negative, then the code will proceed?\n\nWait, in the original Java code: if the user types a negative number, like n=-5. The loop runs while(n>0). So if n is negative, the while loop doesn't run. The string is empty \u2192 count 0. Which is correct? Well, if the code is supposed to process n as the absolute value, but in the problem statement for codeforces 579A?\n\nLooking up the problem, Codeforces problem 579A is titled \"Establishing Credit,\" but without knowing exactly, but perhaps the input constraints require n to be non-negative. So assuming that the input n is always non-negative, as per problem constraints, the code will be okay. So perhaps this is okay.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, the original Java code uses the Scanner to read nextInt, which works for negatives as well, but in the code, if a negative is given, the loop would not execute, leading to an answer of 0. So the code should be correct as per problem's specifications, so perhaps the C code will mirror that.\n\nNow, in the code, but in C, the variable s in C is an array of characters, which is properly null-terminated. The loop over the string's characters from 0 to idx-1 is correct.\n\nTesting that:\n\nchar s[33], idx is 2 when n=3 \u2192 chars at 0 and 1, then idx=2. then s[2] is 0, so loop i from 0 to 1: correct.\n\nNow, compiling the code, I think it should work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can be written without the array, but since it's a direct translation, this approach works.\n\nTherefore the final code in C would be as above."
