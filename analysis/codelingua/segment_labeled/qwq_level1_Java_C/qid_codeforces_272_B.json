  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads n integers, then for each integer, it counts the number of set bits (1s) in their binary representation using the rec function. It stores the counts in an array a of size 33, probably because the maximum number of bits for a 32-bit integer is 32, and they might need an extra slot. \n\nThen, the program calculates some summation based on the counts in the array. The summation formula is (1 + (a[i]-1))/2.0 multiplied by (a[i]-1). Which, if I recall correctly, is the sum of the first (a[i]-1) integers. Because sum from 1 to k is k(k+1)/2, but here it's adjusted for (a[i]-1). So for each count a[i], this part adds that sum to the total answer. The final answer is printed as a long.\n\nNow translating this to C.\n\nFirst, the FastReader class is used to read inputs quickly. In C, we don't have classes, so we can use standard input functions. For faster input, maybe read via stdin using scanf, but need to process tokens properly. Since the Java FastReader uses BufferedReader, perhaps in C we can read all input at once or read line by line, but probably using scanf is sufficient here, as the problem's input should be straightforward.\n\nLet me outline the steps in C:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. For each of n numbers, compute the number of set bits (rec function in Java).\n3. Keep a count array a of size 33, increment the count for each computed bit count.\n4. Calculate the summation as before.\n5. Output the final answer.\n\nFirst, the rec function. In C, to count the number of set bits in a number. The Java version loops from 31 down to 0, checking each bit. So in C, the function would take a long (since Java's sc.nextInt() returns an int, but when using nextInt(), in C it's just an int). Wait, wait.\n\nWait the Java's nextInt() returns an int (32 bits), so the numbers passed to rec are integers. However in the Java code's rec function, the parameter is a long x. Wait why? Because maybe the input could have been a larger integer? Wait no, nextInt() returns an int. So the Java code is converting it into a long for x, but in the loop, they check each bit from 31 down to 0. Since an int in Java can be up to 31 bits (since it's signed, but since it's about set bits, maybe they process all bits, so the code counts bits up to 31. Wait the loop in rec goes from 31 down to 0. Wait the initial code for rec in Java is:\n\nstatic int rec(long x) { ... for k from 31 down to 0:\n\nWait, in Java, a 'long' is 64 bits. So by iterating up to 31, the maximum bits considered are the first 32 bits (since 0-based). Hmm, but perhaps the input numbers are all integers (so 32 bits or 64?), but the rec function might be intended to count the bits. Wait, perhaps the function is named 'rec' but it's not recursive, maybe the name is misleading. Actually, this function is just counting the number of set bits in the binary representation of x.\n\nWait in C, for an integer, we can count set bits by looping over each bit. But in this case, the original code loops k from 31 downto 0, and checks if the (1<<k) bit is set. Wait, but 1 <<31 is a negative number for a signed integer in C? No, but in C, integers can be signed or unsigned, but when working with bitwise operations here, perhaps using unsigned types would be better to avoid sign extension issues.\n\nWait the original code in rec is taking a long x, but checking bits from 31 down to 0, which is 32 bits. So the maximum possible bits counted here is 31? Wait no, if it loops from 31 to 0, that's 32 bits. So for a 32-bit number (like an int in C), this loop is effectively checking all 32 bits. Wait, so the function counts the number of 1 bits set in the integer x. So in C, to implement the same function, given an integer, we need to count the bits. \n\nSince the function is being called with sc.nextInt(), which returns an int (32 bits, perhaps 63 if it's a long, but in Java, x is a long here but input is an int, which when converted to a long for the parameter, no problem). But in our case, in C, since the input is via scanf, when using %d, it's an int. Let's see, the input numbers are read via sc.nextInt() which in C would be a loop of scanf(\"%d\", &var) for each number.\n\nTherefore, the C function for counting bits will take an int (or maybe unsigned) as an argument. Let's think in terms of a function count_set_bits(int x) which implements the same as rec(x). The original rec function loops from 31 downto 0, checking each bit. Alternatively, we can do this by looping through all bits up to the highest set bit. Wait the original code loops all bits from 31 down to 0 (32 bits), but in any 32-bit integer, the maximum bit is 31. So for C, since an int might be 32-bit, the same approach can be used: \n\nstatic int countBits(int x) {\n    int count = 0;\n    for(int k = 31; k >=0; k--)\n        if( (x & (1 <<k)) !=0 ) count++;\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait but in C, shifting 1<<31 could be a problem if the int is signed. Because 1<<30 is okay, but 1<<31 would be 2^31, which for a signed 32-bit integer is -2147483648 (since two's complement), but when you perform bit-wise AND, perhaps allowing to use unsigned types would be better to avoid negative values. \n\nAh, right. So in C, shifting 1 <<31 on a signed integer where the bit 31 is the sign bit might cause undefined behavior due to overflow. To avoid that, the best approach in C would be to treat x as an unsigned integer. \n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to cast x to unsigned int and use that in the loop. Let's adjust the function:\n\nstatic int countBits(int x) {\n    int count =0;\n    unsigned int u = x; // Or cast as unsigned int\n    for(int k=31; k>=0; k--) \n        if( u & (1U <<k) ) count++;\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait yes. Because using unsigned integers won't have sign bits. The mask (1 <<k) would be treated as an unsigned value if using 1U <<k, which is good.\n\nAlternatively, we can process all bits by a loop until x is zero, but this code loops 32 times regardless, which is acceptable for code size.\n\nSo the rec function can be written safely this way.\n\nNow the main code structure:\n\nIn the C code:\n\n- Declare an array a of 33 integers (since the max bits counted can be 32, which is possible if the number is all 1's like 0x80000000-1. Wait, but if x is -1 as a signed integer, 0xFFFFFFFF has 32 bits set. So the maximum bits counted can be up to 32. So the array a has size 33 to store up to the count of 32, so indices from 0 to 32. The code uses a's length of 33, so 33 elements (indices 0-32).\n\nSo in C:\n\nint a[33];\n\nThen, for each of n numbers, read the number, compute the bits count (call countBits), and a[countBits_result]++;\n\nThe rest of the code is summing over the array a.\n\nThe summation part: \n\nFor each i, a[i] is the count of numbers with i set bits. Then, the formula is (1 + (a[i]-1))/2.0 * (a[i]-1). \n\nWait, let's see: 1+ a[i]-1 is a[i], so (a[i]-1 +1)/2 is (a[i])/2, then multiplied by (a[i]-1). So the term is (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2. Which is the same as (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2.0. Because that's the sum from 1 to (a[i]-1) numbers. Because sum_{k=1 to m}k is m(m+1)/2; here m is (a[i]-1) - 0? Wait the sum is (1+ (a[i]-1)) * (a[i]-1)/2. Exactly. So the code calculates that as summ, adds it to the total answer (double).\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nNow, in C, handling arrays is direct. The challenge is the input handling. \n\nThe main parts:\n\nThe FastReader in Java reads tokens efficiently, so in C:\n\nThe Java code uses sc.nextInt() in a loop for n times, to read n integers. \n\nWe can achieve this by reading via scanf in a loop. \n\nSo code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint countBits(int x) {\n    int count =0;\n    unsigned int u = (unsigned)x; /* Or use x as is, but use 1U<<k */\n    for (int k=31 ; k >=0 ; k--){\n        if ( (u & (1U <<k)) )  count++;\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[33] = {0};  // Initialize all elements to 0;\n    for (int i=0 ; i <n ; i++) {\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        int bits = countBits(x);\n        a[bits]++;\n    }\n\n    double answer =0;\n    for(int i=0 ; i <33 ; i++) {\n        int cnt = a[i];\n        if (cnt >=2 ) { // else, a[i]*(a[i]-1) would be 0* etc so no contribution\n            double term = (double)(cnt * (cnt-1)) /2.0;\n            answer += term;\n        }\n    }\n    // Or compute it as:\n    // answer += (1 + (a[i]-1))/2*(a[i]-1) but written as (cnt * (cnt-1))/2. Same thing.\n    // Either way, in C:\n\n    // Wait, the formula is (1 + (a[i] -1 )) /2.0 * (a[i]-1) which is the same as (a[i] * (a[i]-1))/2\n    // So can directly calculate that way.\n\n    answer = ...;\n    // then print the integer part (as long?), because it's cast to long before printing in Java.\n    // The Java code does out.println( (long)answer ), which truncates to integer.\n    // Since all terms are integers (sum of integers?), so the sum could be a fractional, \n    // But actually, the terms are (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2, so when summed, they are sum of integers (even if a[i]-1 is odd), because the division by 2 would be exact when (since a[i]*(a[i]-1) is product of two consecutive numbers, which is always even, so division by 2 yields integer.\n\nTherefore answer is an integer. So in Java, they cast to long for printing, which is equivalent to truncating a double to a long (but in this case, it's integer).\n\nTherefore in C, the answer is a double that is an exact integer. Then we need to cast to long long or just print as a long? \n\nIn C: we can cast to (long long) answer, but in C, it's probably (int) because the Java code uses (long), but since answer is up to (32 * n *n ) /something? \n\nWait, for n up to 1e5 or whatever the constraints might be, but the problem is from codeforces, so probably ok.\n\nWait in any case, the problem expects the correct integer as output.\n\nSo in C:\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", (int)answer); // assuming it's an integer.\n\nWait but in the Java code, it's cast to (long), but since the answer is the sum of doubles which are actually integers, casting to any integer should work. \n\nSo in code, after the loop:\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", (long long)answer);\n\nWait but maybe int is enough? Because (cnt * (cnt-1)/2 is int up to (1e5)^2, but perhaps the total is big, but considering that a[i] can be up to n (if all numbers have the same bit count). Suppose n is 1e5, then the term is 1e5 * 1e5 ~ 1e10, which fits into a long long (which is 64 bits). So to be safe, printf as %lld and cast to long long.\n\nWait but in C, the standard types. Let's think about the maximum answer.\n\nSuppose all n numbers have the same bit count. So a[i] is n, then the term is n*(n-1)/2. So maximum if n is, say, 1e5: 1e5 squared is about 1e10 which is within long long's capacity (since 2^32 is ~4e9, so 1e10 is up to 30 bits).\n\nBut in any case, using doubles as in the original code, the sum might be up to 1e10, so using double can handle that (since double has about 53 bits of precision for integers, so no problem). \n\nThus, the code can proceed:\n\nNow, the input in C. The standard code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nthen the main function.\n\nNow potential issues with reading inputs. The tradition in C is to read via scanf, but sometimes there can be space/newline issues. Since in the Java code, the FastReader reads tokens properly (using nextInt() etc), so as long as in C the input is fed as space separated numbers, the next %d will pick up the next token.\n\nSo assuming the input is correct, the loop scanf works.\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nWait the rec function in Java is called with x's which are integers (from nextInt()). The C code's countBits function works correctly on integers.\n\nNow putting this code together.\n\nAnother point: The array a[33] is initialized with zeros. So in C, when we declare int a[33] = {0}; that's okay.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nWait in C, the countBits function is static (as in Java's static function) but in C, the static keyword is for file scope, but here it's okay. Or just have it inside main? No, better to define it as static before main.\n\nWait:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstatic int countBits(int x) {\n    /* code */\n}\n\nint main() {\n    /* main code */\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow code:\n\nstatic int countBits(int x) {\n    int res =0;\n    unsigned int u = (unsigned int)x; // converting to unsigned so that all bits accessible\n    for (int k=31; k>=0 ; --k) {\n        if( (u & (1U << k )) ) {\n            res++;\n        }\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nIn main:\n\n    int temp;\n    for(int i=0;i <n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\",&temp);\n        int bits = countBits(temp);\n        a[bits]++;\n    }\n\nThen the SUM loop:\n\ndouble answer =0.0;\nfor (int i=0; i <33 ; i++) {\n    int c = a[i];\n    if (c <2) continue;\n    answer += (double)c * (c-1)/2.0;\n}\nprintf(\"%ld\\n\", (long)answer); \n\nWait wait, because in the Java code they add summ which is (1 + (a[i]-1)/2.0 * (a[i]-1). \n\nWait 1 + (a[i]-1) is a[i]. So (a[i]*(a[i]-1))/2. \n\nYes, so (c * (c-1)) / 2.0.\n\nThus the code above is okay. So in code:\n\n// or, to compute it precisely:\n\n    answer += (double)c * (c-1)/2.0;\n\nThen print as (long) which is okay. \n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nLet me see. Suppose n=1. Then a[i] for that number's bit count is 1. So for all i except the bit count (say bits), a[bits] =1. So in summation, since c is 1, term is zero, so the total answer is 0. The code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, two numbers with same bit count. Say count=5. Then a[5]=2, so term is (2*1)/2=1. So the code outputs 1.\n\nAnother case: three numbers with same count: c=3. Term is 3*2/2=3. So code would give 3.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow the code structure in C.\n\nWait in the Java code, the FastReader's nextInt() is properly using buffered reader to avoid slow line-based reading. In C, scanf is optimized and should be okay for the problem constraints.\n\nTherefore, the C code would be as follows."
