The input x is given as 1-based, so converted to 0-based indexes.\n\nThen, count the number of roots: where par[i] == i. So loop over all elements and count how many are roots.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, in C, the code structure would be as follows:\n\n- read the input using scanf.\n- create the UnionFind struct with n elements.\n- loop over m edges, read each x,y,z (but using x-1 and y-1 as the nodes)\n- after processing all edges, count the number of roots.\n- print the count.\n\nFirst, implementing the Union-Find:\n\nIncluding necessary headers. Will need stdio and stdlib for malloc.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn the main function:\n\nint main() {\n    int n = ...; // via scanf\n    int m = ...;\n    struct UnionFind *uf = create_uf(n);\n\n    Then for the edges:\n    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        int x, y, z;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x, &y, &z);\n        x--, y--; // convert to 0-based\n        unite(uf, x, y);\n    }\n\n    Then count the roots.\n\n    int cnt = 0;\n    for (i=0; i <n; i++) {\n        if (find(uf, i) == i) cnt++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", cnt);\n}\n\nSo now the functions:\n\nFirst, the create_uf function.\n\nstruct UnionFind *create_uf(int n) {\n    struct UnionFind *uf = malloc(sizeof(struct UnionFind));\n    uf->n = n;\n    uf->par = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    uf->rank = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        uf->par[i] = i;\n        uf->rank[i] = 0;\n    }\n    return uf;\n}\n\nAnd the find function as mentioned before (either recursive or iterative).\n\nWait, in the iterative approach, the find can be written:\n\nint find(struct UnionFind *uf, int x) {\n    while (uf->par[x] != x) {\n        uf->par[x] = uf->par[uf->par[x]]; // path compression, not full but some\n        x = uf->par[x];\n    }\n    return x;\n}\n\nWait no, that's a single step path compression. Alternatively, the full path can be followed and updated. Alternatively, recursive implementation as in Java.\n\nHmm the Java code uses recursive path compression where each recursive call stores the result.\n\nSo let's implement the find recursively in C:\n\nint find(struct UnionFind *uf, int x) {\n    if (uf->par[x] != x) {\n        uf->par[x] = find(uf, uf->par[x]);\n    }\n    return uf->par[x];\n}\n\nYes. That way, it's the same as Java's code, which uses memoization via path compression.\n\nWait, this is an iterative approach? No, this is recursive. Each time, the function calls itself for par[x], and then updates par[x] to point directly to the root.\n\nWhich is equivalent to the Java find's recursive method.\n\nOkay, that's better.\n\nNow, for error checking (memory allocation), but in programming competitions, we often skip it assuming malloc won't fail.\n\nNow putting all code together.\n\nWait also, in the C code, the variables need to be declared before their use. So in loops, variables like i would need to be declared outside. \n\nLike, for the loop over m edges:\n\nint i;\nfor (i=0; i < m; i++) {\n\n}\n\nAlso, the variables x,y,z are needed inside the loop, so need to be declared each time or inside the scope. In C (pre-C99), variable declarations must be at the top of the block. Wait, but in C99 and above, it's allowed to declare variables in the loop's initialization. But to be safe, perhaps just declare them in the outer block, but using a new set each iteration is okay.\n\nAlternatively, inside the loop:\n\nfor (...){\n    int x,y,z;\n    scanf(...);\n}\n\nThat's suitable, as in each iteration, x, y, z are re-declared.\n\nSo the code:\n\nBut first declaring the struct:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int n;\n    int *par;\n    int *rank;\n} UnionFind;\n\nWait using a typedef for the struct makes it easier.\n\nNow, putting all code together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int n;\n    int *par;\n    int *rank;\n} UnionFind;\n\nUnionFind* create_uf(int n) {\n    UnionFind *uf = (UnionFind*)malloc(sizeof(UnionFind));\n    uf->n = n;\n    uf->par = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    uf->rank = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        uf->par[i] = i;\n        uf->rank[i] = 0;\n    }\n    return uf;\n}\n\nint find(UnionFind *uf, int x) {\n    if(uf->par[x] != x) {\n        uf->par[x] = find(uf, uf->par[x]);\n    }\n    return uf->par[x];\n}\n\nvoid unite(UnionFind *uf, int x, int y) {\n    x = find(uf, x);\n    y = find(uf, y);\n    if(x == y) return;\n    if(uf->rank[x] < uf->rank[y]) {\n        uf->par[x] = y;\n    } else {\n        uf->par[y] = x;\n        if(uf->rank[x] == uf->rank[y]) uf->rank[x]++;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n = 0, m =0;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    scanf(\"%d\", &m);\n    \n    UnionFind *uf = create_uf(n);\n    \n    for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n        int x, y, z;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x, &y, &z);\n        x--;\n        y--;\n        unite(uf, x, y);\n    }\n    \n    int cnt =0;\n    for(int i=0; i< uf->n; i++) {\n        if(find(uf, i) == i) {\n            cnt++;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", cnt);\n    \n    // free the memory\n    free(uf->par);\n    free(uf->rank);\n    free(uf);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but when freeing, perhaps need to free the par and rank arrays, then the uf struct itself. The create_uf allocated the struct itself, the par array, and the rank array. So in the end, freeing each in reverse order.\n\nYes, so the free(uf->par), free(uf->rank), then free(uf) is correct. \n\nWait, but in the main code above, after using uf, those calls to free are necessary for correctness. Since the user didn't do it in Java, but in C, it's better to clean up. However, in programming competition settings, sometimes people omit it for code brevity, but in a proper program, it's better include.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nIn the code, after reading n and m, proceed. The loops are okay.\n\nNow, the initial code's doIt() function in Java uses the Scanner, here, with scanf. Also, note that the problem's input might require reading all the data correctly. The code as written reads each line with three numbers for each of the m edges. \n\nWait in Java, the input is read via sc.nextInt() for each. So in C, the same logic: for each of the m edges, read three integers: x, y, z, but only using x and y (after conversion). \n\nYes, so the scanf in C is okay.\n\nWait, but sometimes the numbers are separated in different lines but for the problem, the input is probably given as m lines each with three numbers. So the scanf will read space-separated inputs properly.\n\nAnother thing: the z parameter in the input isn't used. The original Java code had it, but it wasn't part of the unite function. So in C, the code also reads z but doesn't use it. That's okay.\n\nPossible loop variables: in the creates_uf loop, if the code uses 'i' inside a for, but the loop has 'int i' in the for statement.\n\nYes, in C99, 'for (int i=0...' is allowed.\n\nNow, edge cases: like n=0? Probably not since n is given as per problem, but in programming competitions, usually n is at least 1. So the code should handle n=0 with no problem? Well, perhaps the problem constraints say n is \u2265 1, so it's okay.\n\nAnother point: the MOD constant in the Java code (final int MOD=1e8+7) but that's not used in the solution. So it's okay to omit in C.\n\nThus, the code above is the correct translation."
