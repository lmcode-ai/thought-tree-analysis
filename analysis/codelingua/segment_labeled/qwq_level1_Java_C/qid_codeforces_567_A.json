For each element, it calculates 'max' as the maximum between (current element minus the first element) and (last element minus current element).

So ar.length is replaced by a.\n\nWait variables:\n\nIn C:\n\nThe maximum index is a-1.\n\nTherefore in the loop:\n\nfor (i from 0 to a-1)\n\nSo let me outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, include the necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nAnd for malloc:\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nNo need for math.h unless I use functions like fmax, but I can replace Math.max manually.\n\nThe main function begins.\n\nFirst read the integer a:\n\nint a;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\nThen allocate array ar as int*, size a elements:\n\nint *ar = (int*) malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n\nThen read a numbers:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < a; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &ar[i]);\n\nNow the second loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < a; i++) {\n\n   calculate max:\n\n   int current = ar[i];\n\n   int first = ar[0];\n\n   int last = ar[a-1]; \n\n   int val1 = current - first;\n\n   int val2 = last - current;\n\n   max_val = (val1 > val2) ? val1 : val2;\n\n   Then compute min_val.\n\n   if (i ==0 ) {\n\n        min_val = ar[i+1] - ar[i];\n\n   } else if (i == a-1) {\n\n        min_val = ar[i] - ar[i-1];\n\n   } else {\n\n        int prev_diff = ar[i] - ar[i-1];\n\n        int next_diff = ar[i+1] - ar[i];\n\n        min_val = (prev_diff < next_diff) ? prev_diff : next_diff;\n\n   }\n\n   Then print min_val and max_val, separated by space, each pair on a separate line.\n\n}\n\nWait wait, but the code in Java has System.out.println(min + \" \" + max); inside the loop.\n\nSo in C, we need to do printf(\"%d %d\\n\", min, max); for each iteration.\n\nBut variables: in Java the variables max and min are declared outside the loop and get updated each time. In C, where they can be declared inside the loop, but perhaps more efficient.\n\nWait, the Java code is:\n\nfor (each i) {\n\n   max = ... \n\n   then min is computed...\n\n   then print min and max\n\n}\n\nThus, in C, inside each iteration, variables max and min can be reinitialized.\n\nNow code structure.\n\nLet me put it all together.\n\nWait also, in Java, ar.length is the size. So in C, the equivalent is a.\n\nTherefore, in C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a);\n    int *ar = (int *)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &ar[i]);\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n        int max;\n        int min;\n        // compute max\n        int val1 = ar[i] - ar[0];\n        int val2 = ar[a-1] - ar[i];\n        max = (val1 > val2) ? val1 : val2;\n        // compute min\n        if (i == 0) {\n            min = ar[i+1] - ar[i];\n        } else if (i == a-1) {\n            min = ar[i] - ar[i-1];\n        } else {\n            int prev_diff = ar[i] - ar[i-1];\n            int next_diff = ar[i+1] - ar[i];\n            min = (prev_diff < next_diff) ? prev_diff : next_diff;\n        }\n        printf(\"%d %d\\n\", min, max);\n    }\n    free(ar); // Remember to free the memory\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but what about when a is zero? Well, the problem probably ensures that the input is correct but maybe in practice, but in code translation the Java code would crash if a is zero, same here.\n\nWait, in Java, when a is zero, the array length is zero and loops (like the for (int i=0; i < ar.length;...) would run zero times, so the code should be okay, but in C if a is zero, then malloc(0) is allowed, but the loop would not run so no problem.\n\nBut in the case where a is 1: then when i is 0 (since a-1 is 0), then the code for min would enter i==0, but then i+1 is 1, which is >= a (since a is 1). That's an array access out of bounds.\n\nWait this is a possible bug in the original code. Let me check the original Java code.\n\nWait original java code's loop for i from 0 to ar.length-1 (same as a-1) would also have the same problem if a is 1. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a=1: then in first loop, the array has one element. Then when calculating min when i=0, which is the first element, the code says:\n\nif (i ==0) min=ar[i+1]-ar[i]\n\nBut i+1 is 1, which is indices out of bounds (ar has length 1). So in Java this is an array index out of bounds error.\n\nSame in C code when a is 1, that code will read ar[1], which is invalid. So the original Java code would crash when a is 1. But perhaps in the problem's constraints, a is at least 2? Because Codeforces problem 567A's constraints (I think I should check). But since the user provided code, I have to assume that the original code is correct according to problem constraints. So perhaps the problem specifies that a is >=2. Since that code successfully passes, then in the C translation, we can proceed as given.\n\nTherefore the code is correct under problem's constraints.\n\nThus the C code is as written.\n\nAnother thing: in C, the variables max and min are declared in each loop iteration. So inside the loop, we don't need to worry about previous values, etc.\n\nAnother check: the code in Java initializes max and min to zero, but in the loop they are redefined each time, so the initialization to zero outside is irrelevant unless the loop didn't set their values. But in the code, the first iteration (i=0):\n\nmax is set, min is set. So the initial values of max and min (0) are overwritten.\n\nHence in C, the variables can be declared inside the for loop, initialized properly, or not since in Java they are overwritten.\n\nWait in the C code above, I declared max and min inside the loop, uninitialized, which is bad. That's a bug! Because in C, local variables not initialized have undefined values.\n\nAh right, so in the code I wrote above, that's a mistake. Need to initialize max and min.\n\nLooking back at the code I wrote:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint max; // not initialized\n\nthen compute val1 and val2, set max to whichever is bigger.\n\nBut declaring and then immediately assigning that's okay? Because even though it's declared, after assigning, the value is set. The problem would be if val1 and val2 calculations are based on uninitialized variables, but that's not here.\n\nWait the variables val1 and val2 use ar[i], ar[0], ar[a-1], etc. So as long as the code has read in the array correctly, ar is valid.\n\nSo the only issue is max and min: since their declarations inside the loop's block. So:\n\nmax is set correctly once after declaring.\n\nmin is computed through the conditionals.\n\nSo in C, variables are initialized only if you set them.\n\nTherefore, the code is okay.\n\nWait let me re-express:\n\nInside the loop for each iteration:\n\nFirst, inside the loop block:\n\nint max;\n\nthen immediately compute val1 and val2, then assign max using the ternary, which sets it. So the variable is initialized.\n\nSimilarly for min, its computed through the conditions. All paths in the if/else compute min and assign a value.\n\nThus the variables are properly initialized before use.\n\nThus the code is okay.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the arrays are 0-based, same in C so that's fine.\n\nThe initial code of Java:\n\nThe first loop (reading the array) is written as for (int i = 0; i < ar.length; i++) ar[i] = s.nextInt();\n\nWhich translates exactly to the C for loop.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nFreeing the memory is good to have.\n\nSo the final code should be as above. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, in the first part, when reading the array, in C:\n\nscanf may have some issues if the user inputs something other than integer, but the code proceeds as assuming correct input.\n\nThe 'ar' is properly freed.\n\nThe key is the logic for min when i is 0: ar[i+1] (i is 0) is correct as long as the array is of length >=1. But in the case of a=1, then i+1 is 1 which is beyond the array when a=1, so accessing ar[1] is out of bounds (as the array is 0 to a-1, which for a=1 is 0). So the code is incorrect for a=1. Therefore, perhaps the code is wrong. But the original Java code is also wrong in this case, as the same situation. The problem probably allows a=1? Let me think.\n\nIf the code is given as part of a codeforces problem, perhaps for a=1, the min calculation in between the code would have:\n\nfor i=0 (the only element):\n\nthe code checks i==0, so it does ar[1] - ar[0], but ar[1] is out of bounds. Therefore, the code would crash. Which is a bug in the original code.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem's constraints exclude a=1? Let me think. Because in the problem statement (assuming it's problem A of codeforces 567, perhaps I can recall: problem A 567 is \"Duff and Paintings\".\n\nYes, problem A: Duff and Paintings.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains exactly one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of paintings...\n\nAh okay, so n is at least 2, so a is at least 2. Therefore the case a=1 cannot happen, so the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is now correct.\n\nSo final answer: the C code as above."
