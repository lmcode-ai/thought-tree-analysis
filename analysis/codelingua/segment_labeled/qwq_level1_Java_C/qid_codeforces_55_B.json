  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's go through the Java code step by step and figure out how to do this in C.\n\nFirst, looking at the Java code's structure. It's a program that takes 4 long numbers and 3 operations, then uses some recursive function 'util' to compute the minimum possible result. The key parts are handling input, recursion with permutations, and the operations.\n\nHmm, Java uses objects and has things like ArrayList and Scanner. C is procedural, so I need to manage arrays manually and read input using scanf. Let's start with the variables. The main variables in Java are an ArrayList of Longs. Since C doesn't have dynamic arrays, I'll use fixed-size arrays here. Since the problem starts with 4 numbers, then decreases the count each step, but with recursion, maybe using arrays with pointers or passing by reference will work.\n\nWait, the problem here is the recursive function. Each step, it picks two numbers, applies the operation (as per the ops array), combines them into one, and reduces the array size by one each time until it's 1. The process must explore all possible pairs in all valid operations order.\n\nSo in Java, they create copies of the array each time. In C, I might need to work with arrays and manage copies, but since C doesn't have the convenient ArrayList, maybe I can manage this with fixed-size arrays, like using an array of size 4, then 3, then 2, and so on. But handling variable-sized arrays dynamically could be tricky. Alternatively, since the depth is fixed at 3 operations (since starting with 4 elements, each operation reduces by 1), perhaps using a stack-like structure with a base array of 4, then a copy for each recursion step.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the array as a fixed-size array with a current count. Let me think: the starting array has 4 elements, then each step reduces the number of elements by 1. So, after each step when you combine two elements, the next array will have size currentSize - 1. Since there are 3 operations, after 3 steps, the array will have 1 element, which is the result.\n\nSo the 'util' function in Java works by creating a new ArrayList each time. So in C, I have to do similar: create a new array each time. But in C, you'll need to allocate and pass arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum size needed is 4, then 3, then 2, etc., perhaps I can manage a temporary array in each recursion call. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using pointers and manual array management.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nThe main steps:\n\n1. Read 4 numbers into an array (long in C is 'long' or 'long long', but in codeforces perhaps 64 bits? So using 'long long' for the numbers.)\n\n2. Read 3 operations as strings (either \"+\" or \"*\" ).\n\nThe main function then calls util(), which recursively processes.\n\nIn C, the 'util' function needs to take the current array, the current array size, current operation index, and the operations array.\n\nBut since C doesn't have strings as easy to compare, perhaps use a character array. The ops will be an array of 3 characters (either '+' or '*') stored in a char array.\n\nSo let's think of data structures:\n\nThe main variables in code:\n\n- arr of 4 elements initially, then dynamically changing.\n\nWait, since each recursive call needs to branch into all possible pairs and operations, perhaps the 'arr' should be passed as an array with its current size. Each recursion step (func depth) will have a current size which is 4,3,2.\n\nThe function will take parameters like current array, current length, operations, current op index, etc.\n\nBut in C, functions can't return arrays easily, but the 'util' function in Java is setting the min variable, so maybe pass a pointer to the min as an argument.\n\nSo in C, the structure would be:\n\n- Read input: the initial array (4 numbers into an array of long long), the 3 operations (store in a char array or a single string split apart into individual characters).\n\n- Initialize min as initialized to LONG_MAX (from limits.h), but need to make it global or pass it by pointer.\n\nWait, in Java, 'min' is a static variable. In C, perhaps using a global variable is possible, but better to pass it as a pointer to the function to modify.\n\nNow, translating the 'util' function:\n\nThe Java 'util' function signature is static void util(ArrayList<Long> arr, String[] ops, int idx)\n\nIn C, this would need to be a function that takes the current array, current size, the ops array, the index, and the reference to min.\n\nSignature might look like:\n\nvoid util(long long current_arr[], int size, char ops[], int idx, long long* min_value);\n\nBut how to pass the array? Since arrays decay to pointers, but that complicates copy.\n\nBut in Java, the function makes copies:\n\nIn the Java code's 'util' function:\n\nfor each pair i < j:\n\ncreate a new ArrayList called a, which contains all elements except i and j (so remaining elements).\n\nThen compute the new element (res) based on the operator, add it to a, and recurse.\n\nSo in C, I need to make a copy of the current array, then remove the i and j elements, insert the result, then pass that to the next call.\n\nThat means, in each step when looping over i and j:\n\n- Create a new array (of size current_size -1 )\n\n- copy all elements except the two indices (i and j), add the computed res.\n\nThen recurse with the new array, next index.\n\nBut this requires dynamic memory allocation each time. Alternatively, a stack overflow could be a problem for recursion here, but maybe okay for the constraints of the problem.\n\nBut in C, how to handle array copies?\n\nHmm.\n\nOption 1: Allocate new memory each time, which can get complicated but manageable.\n\nOption 2: Use a larger buffer and adjust pointers.\n\nAlternatively, considering the recursion depth is at most 3, since after each step the array size reduces by 1 each time (starting at 4, then 3,2,1). So three steps.\n\nThus, the maximum recursion depth is 3+1? (since when idx is 3 then returns?)\n\nSo perhaps use arrays of sizes 4,3,2, etc. and manage the current array as fixed arrays. Let me think structurally.\n\nWait, let's see: when starting, the function is called with current array size 4 and idx 0. The first loop runs for 4 elements, then the function calls are for arrays of size 3, with idx 1. Then the next would have arrays of size 2, with idx 2. Then the next would be arrays of size 1, with the last step (idx=2?), no, perhaps the idx starts at 0, then increments each time. Wait in the Java code, the util function loops until idx reaches 3?\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn Java's main:\n\nutil is called with idx 0. The function 'util' has:\n\nif (idx ==3) then compute. Because when idx is 3, you exit the recursion, so at that point the array has one element?\n\nWait, let's see the counting.\n\nInitially, the array has 4 elements, and for each step, the idx is 0. Then each iteration reduces the array by 1, so after 3 steps (idx becomes 0 \u21921 \u21922 \u21923), so when idx==3, which is 3 steps, the array is 1 element (because 4 -3 steps =1).\n\nThus in that case, min is updated with arr.get(0).\n\nSo in C, I can represent the initial array as arr[4], then when recursion goes into util, with a starting array of size 4 and idx 0. When idx hits 3, we can compute min.\n\nThus, in the C code, the maximum array size needed is 4 elements (the starting point), then 3, then 2, etc. So, since recursion depth is limited (3) maybe a stack approach is okay.\n\nSo here's the plan.\n\nImplement the main function:\n\n- Read 4 numbers from stdin into an array of 4 elements.\n\n- Read next 3 strings, they are either \"+\" or \"*\" \u2192 stored in a char array of size 3, each single character.\n\nWait in Java, the inputs are read with scanner (next() ), so each next() reads a token. So the code reads 3 tokens, which are the operations. So in C, using scanf with %c for a single character would work, but care needs to be taken.\n\nBut note that sometimes, when reading with 'scanf', using %c may capture whitespace. To handle this, perhaps read all operations into a array of 3 chars.\n\nWait, in Java, the ops[i] = sc.next(); so each token is either \"+\" or \"*\", so in the input, the operations are three single-character strings.\n\nSo in C, to read the three operations, after reading the four numbers, you do:\n\nchar ops[3];\nfor(int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n    scanf(\" %c\", &ops[i]); // space before %c to consume any whitespace\n}\n\nThat's how that part can be done.\n\nNow, initializing min. Since in Java it's a static long, in C I can use a global variable (though generally not preferred, but for problem solving maybe okay).\n\nAlternatively, pass a pointer to min through all function calls. Let's decide to make it a global variable.\n\nWait: the 'min' is a global variable to keep track of the computed global minimum. Since the only way to update it is through the recursive calls, passing a pointer is more efficient but using global is fine here.\n\nSo:\n\nstatic long long min_val = LLONG_MAX; // from <limits.h>\n\nWait, in C, the min_val can be global.\n\nMain function:\n\nIn main:\n\n- read 4 numbers into arr[4].\n\n- read the 3 ops into a character array (ops[3]).\n\nCall the utility function with initial array and so on.\n\nWait, the utility function in C would need to take the current array and its size, which will reduce each step.\n\nNow, the utility function:\n\nvoid util(long long arr[], int size, int index, char ops[], long long* min_val) {\n\nWait, perhaps pass by reference. Wait in C, functions can't pass arrays by value. You need to pass a pointer to the first element, and the size. So maybe parameter list is:\n\nvoid util( long long *arr, int size, int idx, char *ops, long long *min_val ) {\n\nWait, let me think on each step of the Java code.\n\nLooking at Java's 'util' code:\n\nstatic void util(ArrayList<Long> arr, String[] ops, int idx) {\n\nbase case: if idx ==3:\n\n    min = Math.min(min, arr.get(0));\n\n}\n\nelse:\n\n    for all i from 0 to arr.size-1:\n\n        for j from i+1 to arr.size-1:\n\n            make a new list a, which excludes the i and j elements.\n\n            compute res based on operator\n\n            add res to a\n\n            recurse with a, ops, idx+1\n\n}\n\nSo in C:\n\nThe equivalent would be, for each pair of indices i and j (i < j) in the current array:\n\n- create a new array that excludes i-th and j-th elements, and add the result res computed via applying operator at current ops[idx].\n\nSo steps:\n\nfor (i from 0 to size-1)\n\n  for (j from i+1 to size-1):\n\n    // need to create a new array of size-1 elements, which is arr without elements i and j.\n\n    So:\n\n    The new array will have size-1 elements. Let's call new_size = size-1;\n\n    Create a new array (like a temporary array) of new_size elements.\n\n    Then, in new array, copy elements from the current array except at positions i and j.\n\n    Then, compute res based on the ops[idx] (i.e., the current operator) between arr[i] and arr[j].\n\n    Then add res to the end of the new array. So the array for the next step becomes the new array (excluding i and j except for the res).\n\n    Then call util with the new array, new_size, idx +1, ops, min_val.\n\nWait, but the order might involve inserting the res, but in the Java code, after gathering all elements except the two, it appends the result. So the third is the same as:\n\nnew array is (elements except i and j) plus the result.\n\nSo for example:\n\ncurrent array [a, b, c, d], size=4. Suppose i=0,j=2. Then the elements to keep except those positions:\n\nFor indices 0-3, except 0 and 2: that's elements at 1 (b) and 3 (d). Then the new array before adding the result would be [b, d], then adding the res (after calculation) becomes [b, d, res].\n\nWait no, the original array of size 4, after removing i=0 and j=2 would have elements at indices not 0, 2 \u2192 that is indices 1 and 3. So two elements (2 elements). Then adding res (1 element) \u2192 new size is 3.\n\nWait original size 4:\n\nAfter i=0 and j=2:\n\nthe elements not taken are indices 1 and 3 \u2192 length 2, then add res, total 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo to build the new array:\n\ntemp array of size (size - 2) elements plus the new one, so new_size = (size -2) +1= size-1? Wait, yes. Because removing two elements, then adding one.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nEach iteration, we need to create a new array:\n\nWe'll have to copy elements from the original array except the indices i and j, then add the result.\n\nSo in C, since we can't pass arrays like in Java, need to make a new array for each recursion step. So in the loop:\n\nInside the 'util' function:\n\nLoop over i from 0 to size-1:\n\n  for j from i+1 to size-1:\n\n    // create a new array:\n\n    new_size = size-1\n\n    // Since recursion is going to call itself and pass a new array, we need to allocate space for this new array on the stack, but in C local variables may have stack space which isn't feasible for recursive functions? Or use dynamic memory?\n\nHmm, here's a problem: creating a new array for each pair would require dynamic memory allocation, which can be tricky but manageable.\n\nWait, with the current problem constraints (size starts at 4, decreases until 1, and the recursion depth is only up to 3 steps), perhaps dynamically allocating temporary arrays is okay, as the total memory is small.\n\nAlternatively, making a temporary array in the current scope and then passing a pointer to it.\n\nBut each iteration (i and j loops), we can create a helper array of size new_size (size-1). Let's see:\n\nInside the loops:\n\nlong long new_arr[size-1]; // using VLA (Variable Length Arrays) if allowed in C99.\n\nWait, using a VLA would work but some compilers may not support it. Alternatively, since the max array size is 3 (from initial size 4, then becomes 3, then 2, etc.), we can have a maximum possible size of 3 elements when we get into the second level. So maybe we can hardcode the maximum size.\n\nFor example, the maximum possible array for any step is 4, but inside the loops during recursive steps, the max size needed is 3. So define a temp array of 4 elements even if needed for smaller sizes.\n\nWait, for example, in the initial call with size 4, when creating new_arr of 3 elements. Then in the next step (size 3), new arrays will be 2 elements, etc.\n\nSo in each step, when creating new_arr, it can be a local array with size (size-1).\n\nIn C, using VLA (Variable Length Array), if the compiler allows (like in C99), this is manageable. Or use a fixed maximum size (since the max array is 4, so create a temporary array of 4 elements).\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible array size needed in the process is 3 (since starting from 4, each step reduces by 1), the temp array can be of size 3, but that requires more thinking.\n\nWait the first step (size 4), to make new arrays of size 3.\n\nSecond step (size 3, will become 2 after another iteration).\n\nThird step (size 2 \u2192 1).\n\nTherefore, the maximum temporary array size needed at any time is 3 (but during the first step). So maybe declaring a temporary array of size 3 (since when size is 3, the temporary needed is (3-1) = 2; which is okay).\n\nWait, but the first step needs a size of 3, which a temporary array of size 3 is okay.\n\nAlternatively, For the function util, when i and j are taken, the new array needs size-1 elements. To create that, perhaps an array with size-1 elements can be created on the stack in C, using a VLA.\n\nLet me check: suppose in the function 'util', inside the loops:\n\nlike this:\n\n...\n\nfor (i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n    for(j = i+1; j < size; j++) {\n        int new_size = size -1;\n        long long new_arr[new_size]; // VLA here.\n\n        int idx_new =0;\n        for(k = 0; k < size; k++) {\n            if (k != i && k != j) {\n                new_arr[idx_new++] = arr[k];\n            }\n        }\n        long long res;\n        if (idx <3 && (ops[idx] == '+')) {\n            res = arr[i] + arr[j];\n        } else {\n            res = arr[i] * arr[j];\n        }\n\n        new_arr[idx_new] = res; // since new_size = size-1, but idx_new has been filled to size-2, and adding res gives (size-2 +1) = size-1, which is the new size.\n\n        // now, call util with new_arr, new_size, idx+1, etc.\n        util( new_arr, new_size, idx+1, ops, &min_val );\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but how does adding 'res' work?\n\nWait the new array after copying all elements except i and j has size (size-2). Then when adding the 'res', that brings the new array to size (size-2)+1= size-1. So 'res' is the last element.\n\nWait when filling new_arr, the first indices 0 to (index_new -1) (which is (size-2) length) are filled by all except i and j, then res is put at index (index_new). So yes.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nThe loop for (k from 0 to size-1):\n\nadds all elements except i and j into new_arr, which size is new_size = size-1, so the count of elements in new_arr after loop is (size -2) elements. then, we add res:\n\nnew_arr[idx_new] = res \u2192 since idx_new was (size-2), so after adding, it's correct (0-based up to idx_new is (size-1 -1)? Not sure but the indexes might be okay. \n\nWait, idx_new after the loop would have filled all elements except those, so the number of copied elements is size - 2 (since removing two elements, so size -2 elements). So adding one element (the result) would give (size-1) elements, so the new array should have size-1 elements.\n\nThus, the new_arr has indices from 0 to (size-2), so adding to index (size-2) is okay, and the next index would be (size-2 +1) but since new_size is size-1, that is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way:\n\nAfter the loop, the number of copied elements is (size-2); thus, then adding res to new_arr[index_new] (which was initially 0 to index_new-1: index_new is size-2), then new_arr[index_new] = res \u2192 index_new is size-2 \u2192 now the new array has (size-1) elements.\n\nThus, when passing the new array, we can use new_size = size-1.\n\nNow, calling util with new_arr, new_size, etc.\n\nYes, this way, the newly allocated VLA (variable length array) will be passed to the next level.\n\nBut in C, when passing an array as a parameter, it decays into a pointer to its first element, and the function just knows the pointer, so the function can just take the array through a pointer and the size.\n\nBut in C, the temporary arrays allocated on the stack as VLA are destroyed after the current scope (the current loop step?), so passing a pointer to it may not be safe after returning from the recursive call. Wait no, the array 'new_arr' is a local (automatic) variable in this loop iteration, and so when we recursively call 'util', until that function returns, the control flow is blocked. So when the function 'util' is called, it's using the 'new_arr' array from the current scope, but when it returns control to the ith and jth loops, the new array is still valid (since the stack frames for those loops still exist). So technically, the pointer is still valid during the recursive call but the array would be gone after returning. Wait no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, when you create the new_arr in a loop iteration (i,j), and then call util( new_arr, etc. ), the new_arr is on the stack in the current function frame. However, when the recursive call to util happens, the function calls the lower level. When the recursion unwinds, the stack frame for this i,j iteration still exists? Or does it pop the stack?\n\nWait when you make a function call, the current function's stack frame is pushed, and when entering util(), you have a new stack frame.\n\nWait when the new_arr is declared inside the loop iteration (i,j), inside inner loops, it's part of the current stack frame of the current 'util' function call.\n\nThus, when you call another 'util' function, the previous stack frame (including the new_arr array) is active until the function returns. So, passing the array as a pointer to the next function is okay, as the array remains in memory until that outer function returns.\n\nWait think of it this way: when you have a series of recursive calls, each invocation has its own stack frame. The array 'new_arr' in the current scope is stored in the current stack frame. When the function calls another util, it's a new stack frame. But when this new util does its work, the previous one's array is still there.\n\nWait but in practice, when you pass a pointer to the 'new_arr' to the recursive function, that array is part of the current frame. However, once we return from the current function (after the loop), the array will be destroyed. But because recursion requires that subsequent functions in the call chain have access to their own data, but in the current scenario, when we are in the middle of the loop iteration and we call the recursive function, the new_arr is still around. Only after the function call returns to that iteration, the array is no longer needed. So as long as all the recursive steps complete before the loop iteration is exited, it's okay.\n\nIn the recursive steps, the calls to 'util' enter, and when the leaf function is returning, the parent frame is restored, so the new_arr array is still present for each call in the chain. Essentially the memory is preserved during the lifetime of the recursive call. So this approach should work without any dangling pointers.\n\nTherefore, the use of VLA should be feasible here provided the compiler supports it, which is possible.\n\nSo code structure.\n\nNow, in C the main function would be:\n\nint main() {\n\n    long long arr[4], min_val = LLONG_MAX;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i <4; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &(arr[i]));\n    }\n\n    char ops[3];\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        scanf(\" %c\", &ops[i]);\n    }\n\n    util(arr,4,0,ops, &min_val);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", min_val);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, in C, the functions can be declared, so first, the function should be declared before main if not defined before:\n\nThe declaration would be:\n\nvoid util( long long *arr, int size, int idx, char ops[], long long *min_val );\n\nNow implementing the 'util' function as:\n\nvoid util(long long arr[], int size, int idx, char ops[], long long *min_val) {\n\n    if (idx ==3) {\n        *min_val =  (arr[0] < *min_val) ? arr[0] : *min_val;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Now, iterate all possible i and j pairs\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        for (int j = i+1; j < size; j++) {\n\n            // Make a new array of size (size-1)\n            int new_size = size -1;\n            long long new_arr[new_size]; // VLA\n            int idx_new = 0;\n\n            // copy elements except i and j\n            for (int k =0; k < size; k++) {\n                if (k != i && k != j) {\n                    new_arr[idx_new++] = arr[k];\n                }\n            }\n\n            // compute result for operator\n            long long res;\n            if ( idx <3 && (ops[idx] == '+' ) ) {\n                res = arr[i] + arr[j];\n            } else {\n                res = arr[i] * arr[j];\n            }\n            // add to new array\n            new_arr[idx_new] = res; // since idx_new = size-2, so new size is (size-1)\n            // now recurse\n            util(new_arr, new_size, idx +1, ops, min_val );\n        }\n    }\n    // no return here: only exit at base case\n}\n\nWait wait, for the operator, in the Java code the condition is idx <3 because the ops.length is 3 (since he loops ops[i], for i<3).\n\nWait in the 'util' function in C, the 'idx' can be up to 2 (since initially starts at 0, and when it increments to 3 \u2192 so the condition in the 'if (idx==3)' checks that.\n\nWait, the 'ops' in the Java code is an array of length 3 (indices 0-2). So in the code, the operator is ops[idx], but the 'idx' can reach up to 3, but only when the base case is hit (idx==3), which means that the loop has already been exited. Therefore, in C code the condition 'if (idx <3)' isn't needed to check array bounds, because the loop can only call 'util' with idx up to 3-1 =2.\n\nTherefore in C code, when we're at current 'idx' (<=2), the ops have a valid index.\n\nFor example, when the recursion is called to index +1, when 'index' was 2, then the next index is 3, and the next call will hit the base case (if (index==3)), so in that case, when operating at the next step:\n\nThe 'idx' when calculating at idx=2:\n\nwhen applying the operator, since idx is 2 (the third operator in the list, 0-based, the third is ops[2] is used, and then when going to idx+1=3, which hits the base case.\n\nThus, in the calculation of 'res', no need for 'if (idx<3)' because in the code path, that should never be the case beyond 2 loops.\n\nWait the 'if (idx <3' is not needed for the array access. So in code:\n\nif ( ops[ idx ] == '+') \u2192 but in the loops, the 'idx' can only be 0,1,2.\n\nThus, the code in C can safely just check if the operator at ops[idx] is '+' else it's '*'.\n\nWait the problem says: the program reads three operators (ops[3]). So it will always be three. So the web in 'util' is called only with idx in 0-2 before applying, so the operators are valid.\n\nThus, in the C code, the 'res' can be computed as:\n\nres = (ops[idx] == '+') ? (arr[i] + arr[j]) : (arr[i] * arr[j]);\n\nSimplify:\n\nYes, so that's better.\n\nThus, the C code can be written as such.\n\nWait in the code above, after new_arr's creation, adding the res is at 'new_arr[idx_new] = res;'.\n\nBut idx_new is the count of elements after excluding i and j. Because, the first loop for k from 0 to size-1: for each element except i,j, we added to new_arr. The count after that loop will be (size - 2). Since new_size is size-1, the new array must have (size-1) elements. The last element is res, which is added in the new array at index (size-2), then new_arr has (size-2+1) = size-1 elements.\n\nWait, the new array's size is size-1. So adding res at index_new would be:\n\ninitial index_new starts at 0 and the loop runs up incrementing only when we copy elements not i or j. So after the loop, idx_new is equal to (size -2). Then the new array's element count is idx_new, but total needed: size-2 +1 (adding res) \u2192 total size-1.\n\nThe placement is correct.\n\nNow, in the C code, what about the base case?\n\nThe if (idx ==3):\n\n{\n   *min_val = min between *min_val and arr[0]\n}\n\nBut in that case, the array passed to this function call has size 1.\n\nYes, because:\n\nFirst step (size=4, idx=0):\n\nafter first two steps, eventually when three steps are done (idx increments by +1 each time), when i reaches 3:\n\nthe function called would have size =4 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921, and the idx steps: 0\u21921\u21922\u21923 steps.\n\nThus when the function is called with size=1 and idx=3, the arr[0] is the final value, so the min is updated.\n\nTherefore, the condition in the base case is correct.\n\nBut in code:\n\nthe 'arr' parameter passed would have size 1, so accessing arr[0] is okay.\n\nThus, writing C code as above should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if the initial array has numbers with different combination orders?\n\nThe code should explore all possible pairs each step, so that's okay.\n\nNow, testing for a sample input.\n\nFor example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 4 5 6 + * *\n\nSample Input: first four numbers 3,4,5,6. Then the three operations are '+', '*', '*'\n\nWait the code will compute the possible steps:\n\nFirst level (indexes i and j):\n\nthe first operation is '+' so the first step must choose any two numbers, apply +, then proceed.\n\nEtc. The code should find the minimum possible value possible.\n\nTesting with code would help, but the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, code presentation:\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWe also have to include the necessary headers: 'stdio.h' and 'limits.h'.\n\nThe code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <limits.h>\n\nvoid util(long long arr[], int size, int idx, char ops[], long long *min_val);\n\nint main() {\n    long long arr[4], min_val = LLONG_MAX;\n    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &arr[i]);\n    }\n    char ops[3];\n    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        scanf(\" %c\", &ops[i]);\n    }\n    util(arr, 4, 0, ops, &min_val);\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", min_val);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid util(long long arr[], int size, int idx, char ops[], long long *min_val) {\n    if (idx == 3) {\n        if (arr[0] < *min_val) {\n            *min_val = arr[0];\n        }\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        for(int j = i + 1; j < size; j++) {\n            int new_size = size - 1;\n            long long new_arr[new_size];\n            int idx_new = 0;\n            \n            for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {\n                if (k != i && k != j) {\n                    new_arr[idx_new++] = arr[k];\n                }\n            }\n            \n            long long res = (ops[idx] == '+') ? (arr[i] + arr[j]) : (arr[i] * arr[j]);\n            new_arr[idx_new] = res;\n            \n            util(new_arr, new_size, idx +1, ops, min_val);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, I think that is code.\n\nWait, in the line: new_arr[idx_new] = res;\n\nBut 'idx_new' after the loop is size - 2, so the index is size-2, since the array new_arr is size new_size = size-1, so the indexes are 0.. new_size-1. Thus, adding to idx_new (which is now size-2) will set the last element of new_arr. That's okay.\n\nBecause new_size = size-1, so the last valid index is (size-1 -1) = size-2. Wait no:\n\nWait new_size is size-1. So indexes from 0 to (size-2), so the maximum index is new_size-1 = size-2. So when adding res at idx_new (which is size-2), that's the last element. So yes.\n\nWait:\n\nidx_new starts at 0.\n\nThe loop adds elements from the original array, except i and j, leading to:\n\neach element in new_arr is filled from the original except those two.\n\nThe count of elements exclude is 2, so original size of size \u2192 subtract 2 elements \u2192 copied elements = size-2.\n\nThus, after the loop, the number of elements in new_arr is (size-2), and the idx_new is (size-2). Then adding res via new_arr[ size-2 ] will be the (size-2+1) th element?\n\nNo.\n\nWait, the array 'new_arr' is of size (size-1).\n\nAfter the loop, the index_new is (size -2). So when we do:\n\nnew_arr[idx_new] = res \u2192 which is index (size-2), so the new array's elements count becomes (size-2 +1) which is (size-1), which matches the new_size. So that is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting a simple case.\n\nTest case:\n\nSuppose input is 1 2 3 4 with operations +, +, *\n\nThe possible operations would be combining numbers step by step.\n\nBut perhaps better to see if code compiles.\n\nAlso, note that in C, the VLA may be stack-based, but for small sizes (maximum of 3 elements for the temporary) it's okay. \n\nWait another edge case: size=2. Suppose on step with size 2, and needing to pick the only possible pair i=0,j=1, then new_size is 1, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle this.\n\nPotential mistake in indices.\n\nAnother thing, in the code: the new_arr is size (size-1). when creating new_arr with size 'new_size', which is size-1.\n\nIn the code, the 'long long new_arr[new_size]' correctly declares the array. \n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
