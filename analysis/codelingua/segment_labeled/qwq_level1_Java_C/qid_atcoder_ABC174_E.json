Alternatively, perhaps using scanf directly since it's straightforward here. However, given the problem requires multiple numbers, perhaps using fscanf with a stream is better. Now, the Solution's solve method does a binary search between min and max. The binary search checks whether with a given mid, the total cuts required don't exceed k.

So the code above should be correct except possibly for the max's initial value. Wait in Java, the max is set to (int)1e9 +1000. Let's see how that translates to C.\n\nThe value (1e9 in Java is 10^9, so 1000000000. 1e9 is a double, but when cast to int it would be 1000000000. Adding 1000 would be 1000001000.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's see what the original Java code does first.\n\nLooking at the main structure: The Java program reads input from stdin, processes it using some algorithm, and outputs the result. The core part is in the Solution class's solve method and the nei helper function.\n\nThe InputReader class reads input efficiently. The solve method uses binary search to find the minimal 'mid' where the required cuts on the logs don't exceed the allowed 'k' cuts.\n\nFirst step is to figure out how to replicate the InputReader functionality in C. Java's InputReader uses BufferedReader for efficiency, which in C would translate to using fgets and sscanf or similar functions, but since in C we can read input line by line and process it using tokenization. Alternatively, perhaps using scanf directly since it's straightforward here. However, given the problem requires multiple numbers, perhaps using fscanf with a stream is better.\n\nNow, the Solution's solve method does a binary search between min and max. The binary search checks whether with a given mid, the total cuts required don't exceed k. The function 'nei' (probably named a helper function) calculates how many cuts are needed. The formula there is (log + mid -1)/mid -1 per log, and sum all those. Subtract from k. If the result is still >=0, it means mid is possible and we can try smaller mid.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed for the C translation:\n\nFirst, implement the equivalent of the InputReader. Let's see: the Java code reads numbers as integers. Since in C, the standard way is to read from stdin via scanf, but sometimes for speed, especially with multiple tokens, using getchar() and parsing manually can be better. However for simplicity, maybe just use scanf and functions to read arrays.\n\nWait, in C, perhaps the InputReader's readArray function can be implemented as a function that reads n integers from stdin and stores them in an array.\n\nBut how do we pass that in C? The main function will need to read the input similarly.\n\nThe structure of C code would be something like:\n\nThe main function reads n and k, then reads the array.\n\nThen perform the binary search.\n\nFirst, let's see variables:\n\nIn C, variables are declared upfront, so we need to declare variables first.\n\nThe main steps for binary search:\n\nInitialize min to 1, max to 1e9 + 1000 (but that's 1e9 + 1000, but in C, 1e9 could be expressed as 1000000000). Also in C, constants can be defined with #define or using integer literals.\n\nThen perform the binary search loop while min < max:\n\nCompute mid as (min + max)/2. But in C, integer division is standard.\n\nThe condition is whether the required cuts can be done within k cuts. So, the function 'nei' would compute this.\n\nNow, translating the 'nei' function: it takes mid, the array of logs, and k. It iterates through each log, and subtracts the necessary cuts from k.\n\nEach log contributes (log_length + mid -1)/mid -1. So for each log, ( actual log length divided by mid, rounded up, minus 1) because the number of cuts is the number of pieces minus 1. The number of pieces when cutting into pieces of length mid or less (so rounding up to the ceiling). So for a log of length L, (L + mid -1)/mid is the ceiling(L/mid). So the cuts needed are (ceil(L/mid) -1).\n\nThus, each log contributes (log_length + mid -1)/mid -1. So sum over all logs of this, sum all, and see if the total is <=k. Wait no, the code in 'nei' subtracts that sum from the original k. So in the code, in 'nei', for each log it subtracts (log_length + mid-1)/mid -1 from k, and if in the end k is >=0, returns true.\n\nSo the helper function in C can be written as a function that takes mid, array, n, and k, and returns a boolean. Wait, but in C functions can't return booleans; since in C there's no boolean type, use int to represent true (1) and false (0).\n\nNow, putting the main structure together.\n\nLet's plan the C code step by step.\n\nFirst, the main function:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nWe need some utility functions. The main functions needed:\n\nFirst, to read n integers as an array.\n\nThe function could be something like:\n\nint* read_array(int n) {\n    int *arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++)\n        scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n    return arr;\n}\n\nWait but in C, functions are declared before they are used. Also, we need to pass them as parameters.\n\nAlternatively, main can handle the reading:\n\nWait, the original Java's InputReader.readArray(n) reads n integers. So in C, the code would need to read n integers.\n\nAlternatively, write a helper function. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe code structure in C:\n\nIn the main function, read n and k from stdin. Read the array of n integers. Then perform binary search.\n\nThe binary search can be handled in the main function.\n\nImplement the 'nei' function as a helper function.\n\nSo here's a possible structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint compute_cuts_needed(int mid, const int arr[], int n) {\n    // Compute total required cuts. Return the sum\n    int total = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n        int l = arr[i];\n        // compute per log: (l +mid-1)/mid -1\n        int pieces = (l + mid -1)/mid;\n        total += (pieces -1);\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\n    // Read array\n    int *logsLength = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &logsLength[i]);\n    }\n\n    int min =1, max = 1000000000 + 1000; // 1e9 +1000\n    while (min < max) {\n        int mid = (min + max)/2;\n        int needed_cuts = compute_cuts_needed(mid, logsLength, n);\n        if (needed_cuts <= k) {\n            max = mid;\n        } else {\n            min = mid +1;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", min);\n    free(logsLength); // Don't forget to free\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait a second, that's possible. Let me check the logic.\n\nWait in the Java code, the 'nei' function subtracts the cuts from the original k and returns whether k is still >=0.\n\nSo in Java, the 'k' is local to nei? Or in C, I have to compute the total required cuts first, then check if it is <=k. Exactly. So in C, I can precompute all needed cuts, then see if they are <=k. The 'if (nei(mid, ...))' is checking whether 'the total_cuts_needed <=k', so in the code where the condition is:\n\nif ( neik) then proceed meaning yes, so set max = mid.\n\nYes, in the translation, the code becomes:\n\nIn the binary search step:\n\nif (needed_cuts <=k), then we can try a smaller mid (since current mid is possible, so move max down). Else, need to increase mid (set min to mid+1).\n\nWait the code in Java's 'if(nei(mid....)) then max=mid', else min=mid+1.\n\nWait the Java's 'nei' returns true when k is still >=0. Because the 'nei' function subtracts everything from the initial k (k is modified in the function). Wait, wait that's crucial!\n\nWait looking back at the nei function:\n\nprivate boolean nei(int mid, int[] logsLength, int k) {\n    for (int log : logsLength) k -= (log + mid - 1)/mid - 1;\n    return k >= 0;\n}\n\nAh, the 'k' here is called as the original k from the parameters. Thus, this function can't modify the original k in the parent scope. Wait wait Wait, no.\n\nIn Java, primitive types like int are passed by value. So in the 'nei' function, the k parameter is a copy of the original variable. So that means the loop in 'nei' subtracts the required cuts from the parameter 'k', which is a copy. Thus, the 'k' in the 'nei' function is this parameter's copy.\n\nWait, wait. Wait in the 'nei' method:\n\nprivate boolean nei(int mid, int[] logsLength, int k) {\n    for (int log : logsLength) {\n        k -= (log + mid - 1)/mid - 1;\n    }\n    return k >=0;\n}\n\nYes. So, the 'k' here is local to the function, and is the initial value passed in (the original problem's k). So for each log, subtract the number of needed cuts for that log from 'k'.\n\nThus, the code in the function is the same as: sum over all logs of cuts_needed (each log contributes (log_length's cuts) to the sum), and if that total_sum <= original k, then return true. Because the starting k in the function is the parameter, so subtract total_cuts_sum from that k, then see if it's >=0.\n\nThe way the C function compute_cuts_needed returns the total_cuts, so to replicate the 'nei' function's return value, we just check if the total_cuts <= k.\n\nTherefore, the condition in the binary search can be translated as:\n\nif ( compute_cuts_needed(mid, ...) <= k )\n\nso in that case, return true analog (the original code's 'nei' function returns k>=0, which after subtracting the total cuts, is equivalent to: total_cuts <= original_k)\n\nThus, the C code's binary search logic is correct as I outlined earlier.\n\nWait so the C code's 'compute_cuts_needed' function is correct.\n\nThus, the code I showed earlier is almost correct except for possible off-by-ones?\n\nWait the formula in the Java code: for a log, the term is (log + mid -1)/mid - 1.\n\nLet me verify that with an example: Suppose mid is 3.\n\nA log of length 5. (5+3-1)/3 =7/3=2 (integer division truncates) \u2192 (5+3-1)/3 = (7)/3 is 2.333 \u2192 integer division to 2. So 2 -1 = 1, which is correct. Because 5 can be divided into 2 pieces of 3 and 2, so 1 cut.\n\nAnother example: log length 6. (6+3-1)/3 \u2192 (8)/3=2.666 \u2192 floored to 2, so 2-1=1. But wait 6 can be cut into 2 pieces of 3, so 1 cut. Correct.\n\nAnother example: log length 4, mid=3 \u2192 (4+2)/3 = 6/3 =2 \u2192 1 cut. Correct.\n\nWait wait: (log + mid-1)/mid \u2192 the formula is for ceiling of (log / mid).\n\nYes: Because ceiling division in integer terms of a / b can be done via (a + b-1)/b.\n\nSo ceiling(a / b) is (a + b -1)/b when done with integer division.\n\nThus the formula for pieces is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the other part: reading the array.\n\nIn the C code, I'm reading each element using a loop with scanf. But in some cases, if using scanf in a loop, it might be slow for large n, but given that the constraints here are not specified, but given the original uses an InputReader for Java, maybe in C it's okay as long as we read correctly.\n\nWait the Java's InputReader uses StringTokenizer which splits on any whitespace, so the code in C using scanf with %d should work since it reads white-space separated numbers.\n\nSo the code above should be correct except possibly for the max's initial value.\n\nWait in Java, the max is set to (int)1e9 +1000. Let's see how that translates to C.\n\nThe value (1e9 in Java is 10^9, so 1000000000. 1e9 is a double, but when cast to int it would be 1000000000. Adding 1000 would be 1000001000. But in the C code, I have 1000000000 +1000, which is the same. So:\n\nint max = 1000000000 + 1000; // same as the Java's code's value.\n\nThus, that is okay.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nTest with n=1 and k=0:\n\nSuppose n=1, k=0, and the log length is mid. Then, you can't cut it. So the only way is to have the log length <= mid. So to have cuts needed of 0.\n\nWait suppose the log length is l.\n\nThe required cuts is (l + mid -1)/mid -1. For l = mid, it becomes (mid + mid-1)/mid \u2192 (2mid-1)/mid \u2192 (2mid divided would be 2, so (2mid-1)/mid would be floor(2 - 1/mid \u2192 2-0.?), which is 1), so 1 -1 =0. Correct.\n\nIf log length is mid+1, then (mid+1 + mid-1)/mid \u2192 (2mid)/mid = 2 \u2192 so 2-1 =1. So need 1 cuts.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nNow, checking the binary search:\n\nThe loop is 'while (min < max)' and mid is (min +max)/2.\n\nIf the total needed cuts with mid is <=k, then we can possibly get a smaller mid, so set max=mid.\n\nElse, need to increase min.\n\nWait the binary search works for finding the minimal possible value that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait when we have min and max, and the condition is met when total_cuts <=k. The smallest possible value of mid where the condition is true.\n\nWait the condition (total_cuts <=k) is what we need. So we need to find the minimal mid where this condition holds. The binary search approach is correct here.\n\nNow, the code in C's main function seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: freeing the allocated memory for logsLength. That's handled in free(logsLength).\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the array is created via new int[n], which is automatically handled by the JVM, but in C you have to manually free, as done here.\n\nThus, except possible issues with the code's handling of very large n, but assuming n fits in the code, that's okay.\n\nPotential issues in C:\n\nHandling the initial 'reading of the array'. Let me see: the code for reading the array:\n\n    logsLength = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\nIf n is zero, but in the problem, n is given as input, perhaps the constraints ensure n>0.\n\nBut since it's programming competition code, it's likely okay.\n\nAlso, using scanf can have issues if there's any input format error, but the problem states that inputs are integers as given, so that's okay.\n\nAnother possible point: when doing mid = (min + max)/2, since mid could be 1e9, but (min + max) might overflow as integers. Since in C, int is 32 bits, but 1e9 is about 10^9, so adding two such numbers could lead to overflow.\n\nWait the initial maximum is 1e9 + 1000. Let's compute:\n\n1e9 is 1000000000, so 1e9 + 1000 = 1000001000.\n\nThe maximum possible value of min and max would be up to that. The sum when min and max are both at 1e9+1000, adding gives 2*(10^9+1000). Which is about 2e9+2000. Which is under 2^31 (since 2^31 is about 2.1e9, but if all values are stored in int (assuming 32-bit, int can hold up to 2,147,483,647). Wait 2e9 is about 2 * 1e9, which is 2 billion. Which would exceed the 32-bit signed integer maximum. Oh, that's a problem!\n\nAh, this is a critical point. So in C, if the code uses int variables for min and max, when their values are 1e9, adding them can overflow.\n\nFor example, when max is 1e9 +1000 and min is 1e9, then mid is ( (1e9 + 1e9+1000)/2 ).\n\nThe sum would be 2e9+1000, which is 2000001000, which is way over 2^31-1 (which is ~2.1e9). Thus because (min + max) will be computed as an int, this could overflow, leading to mid being incorrect due to integer overflow.\n\nIn Java, the integers are 32-bit, but for the same initial max. Wait Java's integers can only be 32-bit. So their code has the same problem? Or does the problem's constraints ensure that such values are allowed?\n\nThe problem's constraints for this particular problem (atcoder ABC174 E) must have n and k constraints, so possibly that mid can't reach 1e9, but given that the problem includes the maximum mid as 1e9+1000, the code must handle values up to there. So 1e9 is 10^9. So, with 32-bit integers:\n\nThe maximum allowed 2^31 -1 is 2147483647.\n\nWait 1e9*2 would be 2,000,000,000, which is less than 2^31 (~2.1e9). However, the maximum value set in code is (1e9 +1000). Let me check:\n\n1e9+1000 = 1000001000. 2*(1e9 + 1e3) = 2000002000. Which is still under 2^31 (~2.1e9). Wait 2,000,002,000 is less than 2,147,483,647. So no overflow.\n\nWait 2000,002,000 vs 2,147,483,647 \u2192 indeed, less. Thus the sum of min and max can be up to 2.000e9, which is under 2^31 (~2.1e9). So 32-bit integers are enough here.\n\nGreat, so that's okay. So mid computed as (min + max) /2 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is okay.\n\nWait but in C, when you do int variables for min and max, then their sum can be up to 2*(1e9+1000) ~2e9, which is less than 2^31. So it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the C code as above should work.\n\nAnother thing to check is the initial variables. In C, variables must be declared before any statements in a block. So the main() function is okay as written.\n\nPutting it all together, the C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint compute_cuts_needed(int mid, const int arr[], int n) {\n    int total = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int l = arr[i];\n        int pieces = (l + mid - 1) / mid;\n        total += (pieces - 1);\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\n    int *logsLength = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &logsLength[i]);\n    }\n\n    int min = 1, max = 1000000000 + 1000;\n\n    while (min < max) {\n        int mid = (min + max) / 2;\n        int needed_cuts = compute_cuts_needed(mid, logsLength, n);\n        if (needed_cuts <= k) {\n            max = mid;\n        } else {\n            min = mid + 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", min);\n    free(logsLength);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code's 'nei' function, the original k is passed as a parameter. The C code in compute_cuts_needed just returns the total cuts, then the code checks if needed_cuts <= k, which is exactly the same as the Java's calculation.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think this should be correct. The code reads n and k, then the array, then binary search as required.\n\nWait also, note that the initial array is allocated with malloc. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: when the binary search starts with min=1 and max=1e9+1000. That should be okay, because the minimal possible is 1, maximum possible is the case where each log is cut at max length except the log itself, but according to problem constraints, the logs' length must be handled. Wait, in the problem, since the maximum possible log length can be up to 1e9, but the binary search covers all possible required minimum mids.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSample input 1 example from the problem might help.\n\nSuppose, for example, the problem is something like n=3, k=3, logs [5,9,8]. Suppose the code should calculate the minimal mid.\n\nBut I'll skip actual testing, assuming that the code is a direct translation and logic matches."
