The format would be like \"HH:MM\". So let's read a string like \"HH:MM\". Assuming that the input strings are read properly. Let's have a buffer, say char timing[50], then fgets(timing, 50, stdin); but note that the third line after two reads. Wait, in C, first after main, the code would read first input line (see Java code: the first call is br.readLine(); which would be the first line). So in C code, after the first two variables a and tA, you need to read the second line for b and tB, then read the third line for timing. Wait, in the Java code: First StringTokenizer st is from the first line. So first line split into a and tA.\n\nSecond, for the next line, st is new StringTokenizer on br.readLine(); which contains the second line, splitting into b and tB.\n\nThird line is the timing: br.readLine(). So in C, the code would first read a and tA: perhaps using two scanf calls, but better to read line by line. Wait, in C, how do you read a line at a time? You can use gets() but that's unsafe. Alternatively, fgets():\n\nAssuming code:\n\nchar line1[100];\nfgets(line1, 100, stdin); // first line. Then parse line1 for a and tA: sscanf(line1, \"%d %d\", &a, &tA);\n\nSimilarly for second line:\n\nfgets(line2, 100, stdin);\nsscanf(line2, \"%d %d\", &b, &tB);\n\nThird line: fgets(timing_str, ...);\n\nThen parse timing_str into hours and minutes. The timing is like \"10:30\". To split on colon:\n\nThe hours are the first two characters (up to colon), then minutes after. Alternatively:\n\nchar timing_str[100];\nfgets(timing_str, 100, stdin);\n\nThen:\n\nint hrs = (timing_str[0] - '0') *10 + (timing_str[1] - '0');\nint mins = (timing_str[3] - '0') *10 + (timing_str[4] - '0'); Wait but need to check that the colon is at position 2. Or better:\n\nUse sscanf, maybe:\n\nsscanf(timing_str, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins); Yes, that's better. So sscanf usually handles this. So:\n\nsscanf(timing_str, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins);\n\nThat's easier. So then, simDeparture is hrs *60 + mins;\n\nsimArrival = simDeparture + tA;\n\nThen the loop runs from i starting at 300 (since 300 is 5 hours?), up to 1440 (which is 24*60, so end of day).

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's see what the code does first. From the Java code, it looks like it's calculating how many buses depart after a certain time and arrive before another time. The problem is probably from a programming competition, maybe Codeforces problem 665A.\n\nLet me go step by step. The Java code uses BufferedReader and StringTokenizer to read inputs. In C, I need to read from stdin, probably using scanf or fgets. Let's see the variables:\n\nThe first two integers, a and tA, are read from the first line. Then the next line gives b and tB. Then the timing string is read, which is something like \"HH:MM\". Then they convert that to total minutes (hrs *60 + mins). Then simDeparture is the departure time, and simArrival is departure time + tA. \n\nThe loop runs from 300 to 1440 (assuming 1440 is 24*60, so the end of day?), in steps of b. For each bus departure time i, compute arrival time i + tB. Then check if the bus and simulator times overlap. If not overlapping, continue, else count +=1? Wait the code says if either busDeparture >= simArrival (meaning bus leaves after sim has arrived) or simDeparture >= busArrival (sim departs before the bus arrives) \u2192 so if either is true, they don't overlap, so we skip. Otherwise, we count it. So the counter counts overlapping intervals.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of buses departing between 05:00 (300 minutes) and end of day, every b minutes, such that their departure and arrival times overlap with the simulator's trip.\n\nNow translating to C.\n\nFirst, variables: in C, no need for classes, so main is the entry. Need to read from stdin. Let's think about how to parse the input.\n\nFirst line: read two integers a and tA. Second line b and tB. Third line is the timing string.\n\nWait the first two inputs are given as two integers on one line: for example, the first line would be like \"a tA\". Similarly the second line for b and tB.\n\nIn Java, they used StringTokenizer, so in C, maybe read the first line with scanf for two integers. Like:\n\nint a, tA;\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &tA);\n\nSame for the next line, b and tB.\n\nThen the timing string is read as a string. Since in C, perhaps read using fgets, then parse it. The format would be like \"HH:MM\". So let's read a string like \"HH:MM\".\n\nAssuming that the input strings are read properly. Let's have a buffer, say char timing[50], then fgets(timing, 50, stdin); but note that the third line after two reads.\n\nWait, in C, first after main, the code would read first input line (see Java code: the first call is br.readLine(); which would be the first line). So in C code, after the first two variables a and tA, you need to read the second line for b and tB, then read the third line for timing.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nFirst StringTokenizer st is from the first line. So first line split into a and tA.\n\nSecond, for the next line, st is new StringTokenizer on br.readLine(); which contains the second line, splitting into b and tB.\n\nThird line is the timing: br.readLine().\n\nSo in C, the code would first read a and tA: perhaps using two scanf calls, but better to read line by line.\n\nWait, in C, how do you read a line at a time? You can use gets() but that's unsafe. Alternatively, fgets():\n\nAssuming code:\n\nchar line1[100];\nfgets(line1, 100, stdin); // first line.\n\nThen parse line1 for a and tA: sscanf(line1, \"%d %d\", &a, &tA);\n\nSimilarly for second line:\n\nfgets(line2, 100, stdin);\nsscanf(line2, \"%d %d\", &b, &tB);\n\nThird line: fgets(timing_str, ...);\n\nThen parse timing_str into hours and minutes.\n\nThe timing is like \"10:30\". To split on colon:\n\nThe hours are the first two characters (up to colon), then minutes after.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nchar timing_str[100];\nfgets(timing_str, 100, stdin);\n\nThen:\n\nint hrs = (timing_str[0] - '0') *10 + (timing_str[1] - '0');\nint mins = (timing_str[3] - '0') *10 + (timing_str[4] - '0');\nWait but need to check that the colon is at position 2. Or better:\n\nUse sscanf, maybe:\n\nsscanf(timing_str, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins);\n\nYes, that's better. So sscanf usually handles this.\n\nSo:\n\nsscanf(timing_str, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins);\n\nThat's easier.\n\nSo then, simDeparture is hrs *60 + mins;\n\nsimArrival = simDeparture + tA;\n\nThen the loop runs from i starting at 300 (since 300 is 5 hours?), up to 1440 (which is 24*60, so end of day). The step is every b minutes.\n\nWait the loop is written as for (int i = 300; i < 1440; i +=b ). But in C, variables can be declared here? No, since the for loop in C89 requires variable declarations at top, but in C99, it's allowed. Assuming using C99 compiler.\n\nWait, but in code to be compatible, but perhaps we should just write as in the loop:\n\nint i;\nfor (i=300; i<1440; i +=b )\n\nThen inside the loop, the check:\n\nif ( busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival ) \u2192 continue. else increment.\n\nIn C, the code structure is similar; need to loop through all the bus departure times.\n\nSo, variables: counter is initialized to 0.\n\nSo the code outline in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int a, tA, b, tB, hrs, mins, simDeparture, simArrival, counter=0;\n    char line1[100], line2[100], timing[100];\n\n    fgets(line1, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(line1, \"%d %d\", &a, &tA);\n\n    fgets(line2, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(line2, \"%d %d\", &b, &tB);\n\n    fgets(timing, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(timing, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins);\n\n    simDeparture = hrs *60 + mins;\n    simArrival = simDeparture + tA;\n\n    for( int i=300; i < 1440; i +=b) {\n        int busDeparture = i;\n        int busArrival = i + tB;\n        if( busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival ) {\n            continue;\n        } else {\n            counter++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", counter);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but I should be careful about possible buffer overflows. The fgets uses 100 as buffer, which is enough for the problem's inputs.\n\nWait but the timing string like \"23:59\" is easy. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the problem's case, the third input line may have leading/trailing whitespace? Probably not, but the code with fgets should read the entire line, and sscanf would read the numbers separated by colon. The input for the timing should be exactly in HH:MM format, which the problem expects.\n\nTesting this code.\n\nWait, in the Java code, in the loop, the step is \"b\". But wait, the code in Java uses \"for (int i = 300; i < 1440; i +=b )\" \u2014 so if b is 0, that would be bad, but probably the problem constraints say b is a valid number.\n\nNeed to check if the problem constraints ensure b is positive. Probably yes.\n\nOther edge cases?\n\nWait, the problem might have a 24:00 time? But 1440 is included as in the code uses i <1440? So no.\n\nWait, in C, in the for-loop, i starts at 300 (5:00) and increments by b each time, but the upper limit is <1440. So i can be up to 1439.\n\nFor example, when b is 1, the last i would be 1439, adding 1 would go to 1440, which is excluded.\n\nHmm okay.\n\nWait in the bus departure time would be i minutes since midnight. Then arrival is i + tB.\n\nNow, in the condition for counting:\n\nthe bus departs at i minutes. arrival at i + tB.\n\nsim is departing at simDeparture, arrives at simArrival.\n\nThey count if there's overlap between the buses interval [busDeparture, busArrival) and the simulator's interval [simDeparture, simArrival).\n\nBut in the code, the condition is: if ( busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 bus departs after sim arrives \u2192 no overlap. OR simDeparture >= busArrival \u2192 sim departs after the bus has arrived \u2192 no overlap. So in either case, there's no overlap, so they skip. Else, (if neither condition is true) \u2192 there is overlap, so count it.\n\nYes. So the condition is correct.\n\nSo the code seems okay.\n\nNow, in C, variables must be declared at the top of the block, but since I'm using C99 or a newer version, the for loop variable can be declared inside. But older versions require variables to be at top.\n\nBut perhaps better to move variable declarations outside loops.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nint i, busDeparture, busArrival; // inside the loop, no. Wait, in the loop, in code as written:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nbusDeparture and busArrival could be declared inside the loop, but in C89 you have to declare them before. But if using C99, perhaps inside.\n\nAlternatively, inside the loop, since each iteration, reassign to the same variables.\n\nIt's better to write as in the code sketch, but ensuring that variables are properly scoped.\n\nWait, in the code I have:\n\nbusDeparture and busArrival are declared inside the for loop block. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the loop:\n\nfor( int i=300; i < 1440; i +=b ){\n    int busDeparture = i;\n    int busArrival = i + tB;\n    ...\n}\n\nWait, but then the busDeparture and busArrival would be declared inside the loop. So each iteration, they are created again, which is valid in C99.\n\nAlternatively, declare them before the loop:\n\nint i, busDeparture, busArrival;\n...\nfor( i= ... ){\n    busDeparture = i;\n    ...\n\n}\n\nEither way is okay, but the first is cleaner in C99.\n\nAssuming that the code is written with proper C99 variable declarations, it should be okay.\n\nAnother possible point of confusion: in the timing string reading, if the third line could have newline or other characters. The fgets will read the string up to newline or buffer size. The sscanf(\"%d:%d\") would ignore whitespace, so if there's a newline after the time, it's okay.\n\nNow, the program uses printf to output the counter and returns 0. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, possible issues? Let me check for possible off-by-ones.\n\nSuppose the bus departs exactly at simArrival \u2192 then busDeparture == simArrival \u2192 condition is busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 yes, so continue. So no count. Similarly if simDeparts == busArrival, same. So the condition is correct if we want overlapping intervals to have at least a moment in common? Let's see:\n\nSuppose bus departs at 100, arrives at 150.\n\nSim departs 99, arrives 100 \u2192 their intervals are [99,100) and [100,150). These are non-overlapping. The condition would have busDeparture (100) equals simArrival (100 \u2192 sim arrives at dep + tA? Wait sim's arrival is departure time plus tA. Wait the simulation departure is D, arrival is D + tA. So simulation's time is [D, D + tA). So sim departure is included.\n\nThe bus's interval is [busD, busA), same.\n\nThey overlap only if there exists some time in both intervals. So when do they not overlap? When one ends before the other starts. So if busD >= simArrival \u2192.bus interval starts after sim is done, so no overlap. Or if simD >= busA \u2192 sim starts after bus is done. So the code correctly is checking for those cases.\n\nHence the code is correct in that regard.\n\nAnother possible issue: the third line timing could be read with a '\\n' at end, but sscanf with %d:%d would skip leading spaces, so as long as the time is correctly formatted, it's okay.\n\nAnother thing is the step of the loop. If 'b' is zero, the loop could loop infinitely. But according to problem constraints, maybe b is given as positive? Not sure. But in the problem's case, probably the input ensures b is positive. So code is okay.\n\nNow testing with sample inputs:\n\nSuppose the Java code's sample input:\n\nLet me see sample input 1 from Codeforces problem 665A:\n\nSample input:\n\n0 10\n\n1 1\n\n05:00\n\nWait, then:\n\nWait wait, the first line: a is first number (0), tA is 10 \u2192 sim departs at 5*60? Wait, wait the timing is \"05:00\" \u2192 so 5*60 +0 = 300. Then simDeparture is 300, sim arrival is 310.\n\nThe buses leave every b=1 minute? Or wait second line: b is 1, tB is 1 \u2192 buses depart starting at 300?\n\nWait the loop is i starts at 300; so first iteration is i=300. The bus departure is 300, arrival is 301.\n\nSo the simulator's trip is from 300 to 310. The bus's time is 300\u2192301. Overlap between [300, 310) and [300, 301), so overlaps (including the start point). So will count this?\n\nYes \u2192 so busDeparture is 300 which is not >= 310 (the simArrival), and simDeparture (300) is not >= busArrival (301). So 300 is valid, counted \u2192 so this should count as overlapping.\n\nSo in this case, since buses leave every 1 minute from 300 to 1440, each departure gives a bus that leaves at i and arrives at i+1. The time the simulator is on the road is 10 minutes (300 to 310).\n\nAll buses departing between 300 and up to 309 would overlap. For example:\n\nbus departing at 309: arrives at 310. The simulation's arrival is at 310. The intervals would be [309, 310) and [300, 310), so overlapping at 309-309.9999 etc.\n\nSo that counts as overlapping. So from 300 to 309, 10 buses? And since bus intervals are 1 minute step \u2192 10 buses (300 to 309 inclusive).\n\nWait 300 + tB =301 \u2192 so arrival is 301. So bus 300's arrival is 301 < 310 \u2192 so overlapping?\n\nWait the simulation is until 310. The bus's arrival is at 301 <310. So yes. So all buses from 300 up to and including 309 would depart in [300, ...) and their arrival will be up to 310 (when i is 309 \u2192 arrives at 310. So between 300 to 309 inclusive \u2192 10 buses. So the counter would be 10.\n\nWait the code in this case does loop from 300 to 1440. So for i from 300, 301,\u2026 etc. But for the 2nd step, when i reaches 309, then steps to 310. The next i is 310, which would be added to the loop if 310 <1440. The busDeparture is 310, which would have arrival 311. The condition:\n\nbusDeparture is 310, which is equal to simArrival (310), so busDep >= simArrival \u2192 yes. So it is skipped.\n\nThus, for i=309 \u2192 busArrival is 310. The simulation's departure is 300 and arrival is 310. So the bus departs 309 (i=309) \u2192 departure time is 309. Its arrival is 310.\n\nSo the simulation's interval is up to 310 inclusive? No, the simulation is from depart time including to arrival excluding. So sim's end is 310. The bus's arrival is exactly at the same time \u2192 hence bus arrives at 310. So the intervals are [309, 310], and the simulation's interval up to, but not including 310. So overlapping?\n\nWait let me recheck:\n\nThe simulation's interval is from simDeparture (300) to simArrival (310). So any time t in [300, 310) is part of the sim. The bus's interval is [309, 310). They overlap between 309-310, so yes overlapping, so counts.\n\nWait when i=309, busDeparture is 309. arrival is 309 + 1 = 310?\n\nWait yes, tB is 1.\n\nSo busArrival is 309+1 =310. So the bus's interval is from departure 309 to arrival time 310 (exclusive?), the code uses the arrival time as busArrival. The bus is on road until 310. Then, the bus's interval is [309, 310).\n\nSim\u2019s is [300, 310). So overlapping: Yes.\n\nSo when i=309, the bus and sim intervals do overlap, so it should be counted. So the loop will count that.\n\nThen for i=310: the departure is 310, so busDeparture is >= simArrival (310). So it's skipped.\n\nThus, numbers from 300 to 309 \u2192 10 buses. (since (309-300)/1 +1 = 10). So the code would output 10.\n\nYes, that would be the correct answer for this test case.\n\nSo the C code should handle that properly.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose the simulator leaves at 23:59 (23*60 +59 = 1439), with a trip time of 1 minute \u2192 arrival time 1440 mod 1440? Or is 1440 exactly. But since in the code, simArrival is 1439+1 =1440. \n\nIn that case, the bus departure time has to be before 1440, because the loop condition is i<1440. The maximum i is 1439. Let\u2019s see:\n\nSuppose the bus departs at 1439, tB is 1 \u2192 arrival is 1440. Wait busArrival is 1439 +1 =1440. \n\nThe simulator departs at 1439, arrives at 1440.\n\nBus is [1439, 1440), simulator [1439, 1440). They overlap. Thus counted.\n\nTherefore the code would count this.\n\nNow, if the bus is departing at 1439 (i=1439), since 1439 <1440 \u2192 it is included in the loop.\n\nThus the code is correctly doing that.\n\nEdge case when tB is zero? Probably invalid, but code handles anyway.\n\nNow, what about the print statement in Java: \"pw.println(counter);\".\n\nThe C code uses printf, so same.\n\nIn terms of input reading with fgets, note that the third line may have a new line at the end. But sscanf with a %d:%d skips the colon and other whitespace. So if timing is \"23:59\" or \"05:00\", it\u2019s okay.\n\nNow, putting all together in the code.\n\nThe code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, tA, b, tB;\n    int hrs, mins;\n    int simDeparture, simArrival;\n    int counter = 0;\n    char line1[100], line2[100], timing[100];\n\n    // Read first line\n    fgets(line1, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(line1, \"%d %d\", &a, &tA);\n\n    // Read second line\n    fgets(line2, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(line2, \"%d %d\", &b, &tB);\n\n    // Read timing\n    fgets(timing, 100, stdin);\n    sscanf(timing, \"%d:%d\", &hrs, &mins);\n\n    // Compute departure and arrival times\n    simDeparture = hrs * 60 + mins;\n    simArrival = simDeparture + tA;\n\n    // Iterate over bus departures\n    for (int i = 300; i < 1440; i += b) {\n        int busDeparture = i;\n        int busArrival = i + tB;\n\n        if (busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        counter++;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", counter);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nYes. I think that should work.\n\nWait, a thing to consider: the first line after main may have trailing spaces or newlines? But no, the code uses sscanf with %d which skips whitespaces, so even if the first line has extra spaces, it's okay.\n\nWhat about the case when the line has more than two numbers? Well, the problem says it's correct inputs. So that's okay.\n\nTesting with sample input 2?\n\nSuppose another sample input from Codeforces 665A problem (I think the problem is Traffic Lights in the City ):\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n0 10\n\n1 1\n\n05:00 \u2192 as before, output is 10.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n0 1\n\n5 20\n\n23:50 \u2192 let's compute.\n\nsimDeparture is 23 *60 +50 = 1430. simArrival is 1431.\n\nBus departures start at 300, but with step b=5. Let's see:\n\nBus departure times are 300, 305, 310, ..., up to <1440.\n\nWe need to check which buses are between 300 and 1430+, up to when? The buses need to have departure time i such that their departure <1440, and their departure and arrival overlap with [1430, 1431).\n\nSo let's take possible buses:\n\nThe last bus before 1430 is i = let's check:\n\ni's in the loop from 300, step 5:\n\nWe need i plus tB (20) to have busArrival = i+20. The simulator's interval is [1430, 1431).\n\nSo the bus's departure i can be as early as possible, but to overlap with the sim's time:\n\nFor the bus departure to be <=1430 (since sim starts at 1430), and the bus arrival must be after sim started (so i+20 >1430 \u2192 i> 1410. ??\n\nWait overlapping occurs when:\n\nbusDeparture < simArrival (1431) and simDeparture (1430) < busArrival (i+20).\n\nThus conditions met when:\n\nbusDeparture <1431 AND 1430 < (i+20).\n\nSo first inequality is 1430 is the start of sim.\n\nWait let me rephrase:\n\nbusDeparture < simArrival \u2192 busD < (1430 + tA? Wait sim arrival is 1430 + 1 =1431).\n\nSo busDeparture <1431.\n\nSecond condition: simDeparture < busArrival \u2192 1430 < (i +20).\n\nThus:\n\ni >= 1430 -20 \u2192i >= 1410?\n\nWait 1430 < i +20 \u2192i> 1430-20 \u2192 i>1410.\n\nThus the bus must leave at i \u22651411 and i \u2264 1430 (so bus_departure <1431).\n\nSo,i must be between 1411 and 1430, inclusive.\n\nBut the bus departure is on step 5, so let's compute:\n\nPossible buses between 1411 and 1430 that are multiples of 5 starting from 300. The first candidate after 1410: 1415 (since 300, 305,\u2026 1410? 1410 mod5 is 0. So 1410 is multiple of 5. So the next is 1415.\n\nWait the first i >=1411 is 1415 (if steps are +5).\n\nCheck 1415 to 1430 include:\n\n1415, 1420,1425, 1430.\n\nLet me check:\n\ni=1415 \u2192 bus departure 1415 \u2192 arrival 1415+20 =1435 \u2192 bus interval [1415,1435). The sim is in [1430,1431). Overlap between 1430 to1431 \u2192 yes. Counted.\n\ni=1420 \u2192 same, arrival 1440 \u2192 bus ends at 1440 \u2192 overlaps with sim's interval (1440 is arrival, so until 1431 is still overlapping).\n\ni=1425 \u2192 arrival is 1445 \u2192 overlaps.\n\ni=1430 \u2192 bus departure 1430 \u2192 arrival 1450 \u2192 yes overlaps: departure is 1430, which is the start of sim's interval (1430 is sim's departure). So bus departs at same time as sim starts.\n\nbusDeparture is 1430 (which is less than sim arrival (1431)), and simDep at 1430 < busArrival (1450). So yes overlapping \u2192 counted.\n\ni=1430 is considered since <1440 \u2192 yes.\n\nAlso, 1435 would be next step but i starts at 300:\n\nWait 1435 is still 1435 <1440 \u2192 yes, check:\n\ndeparture at 1435?\n\ni=1435:\n\nbusDeparture =1435 is greater than simArrival (1431) \u2192 first condition (busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 1435>=1431 \u2192 yes \u2192 so skip.\n\nThus the buses that meet are 1415,1420,1425, and 1430?\n\nWait 1430 \u2192 bus Departure=1430 <1431 \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1430: arrival is 1450 \u2192 so yes count.\n\nThe next after 1430 is 1435 \u2192 as above.\n\nThus the count is:\n\nThe valid i values are 1415, 1420,1425, 1430.\n\nThat's 4 buses.\n\nWait let's see the 1430 is included. So how many numbers?\n\n1415 to1430 in steps of 5:\n\n (1430 -1415)/5 = 15/5 =3 \u2192 thus 3 step increments \u2192 4 values.\n\nThus, answer is 4. So let's see what code would compute.\n\nIn the code, what would i?\n\nBus departure i must be in the range from 300,5... up to but less than 1440.\n\nThe values for i between 1411 and 1430, divisible by5 ?\n\nThe first i after 1410 is:\n\n300 is start, but steps until 1415? Let me see:\n\nThe bus's steps are starting at 300, so the terms are 300,305, 310,\u2026 each step +5. So the largest i \u22641430 would be 1430 if it's divisible by 5. Since 1430 mod5 is 0 \u2192 yes, 1430 is a departure time?.\n\nSo the valid i's are 1415,1420,1425,1430. Four times \u2192 code would return 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore the C code should work as intended."
