      "text": "Since codeforces problems often use scanf or fgets with sscanf, I can go with scanf here since the inputs are two integers per line. Next, implementing the reverse function. The original Java reverse(int n) function. Let's re-express that in C:\n\npublic static int reverse(int n) {\n    if (n <10) return n *10;\n    int t =n, r=0;\n    while (t>0) {\n        r = r*10 + t%10;\n        t /=10;\n    }\n    return r;\n} Wait, so for the case n is a single digit, it returns it times 10. So 5 becomes 50. Otherwise, they reverse the digits normally. So the C function must do the same. Let's code that. So in C, function would be:\n\nint reverse(int n) {\n    if (n <10) return n*10;\n    int t = n, r=0; while (t>0) {\n        r = r*10 + t%10;\n        t = t/10;\n    }\n    return r;\n} That's straightforward. Now putting it all together. The main function:\n\nIn C, main would:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n =0, m=0;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    int t = reverse(m);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", t +n);\n    return 0;\n} But need to ensure that the reverse function is declared before main or prototype it first. Since in C, the order matters. So putting the reverse function before main, or include a prototype. Option 1: Put the reverse function above main. Alternatively, put the function after main but have a prototype. Option 1 is better here. So structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint reverse(int n);\n\nint main() {\n   ... // input and compute\n}\n\nint reverse(int n) {\n   ... // the body\n}\n\nWait, but in C, functions must be declared before they are used. So since main calls reverse, the function prototype (int reverse(int n); ) should be placed before main, or the function should be defined before main. Alternatively, place the reverse function before main. Let me code accordingly. Now, checking possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if m is zero? Let's see, in reverse(0), since 0 <10, returns 0 *10 =0? But maybe problematic? But if m is zero, the problem probably expects the reversed number plus n. But according to the code, that's 0",

Another case: m is 19 -> reverse is 91 (because 19 has two digits, so reversed correctly). But m=5 becomes 50, so when adding to n, say n is 7, then 50+7=57 is the output. Now, the code should handle that. Putting all together. Wait: the FastReader's reverse function's t%m. Let me think of the JAVA loop: Wait, no, in the Java code's reverse function, the code loops:\n\nwhile (t>0):\n\nr = (r*10) + t%10;\n\nt = t/10; So, the same as in C. \n\nNow for the reversed number, so the function is correct.
