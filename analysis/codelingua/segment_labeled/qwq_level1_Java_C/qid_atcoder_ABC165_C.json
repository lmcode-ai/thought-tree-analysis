Now, let's think about edge cases. For example, when q is zero? Probably not, but the problem probably states that q >=1. But according to the code structure, when q is zero, the code won't process any conditions. But probably handled. Now, the initial variables: In Java, the variables a,b,c,d are initialized to null, then in main's start they are created. In C, since they are pointers allocated after reading q, which is done correctly. Also, the ans is initialized as -100 in Java, so in the code, same for C. So in main, before calling dfs(current,0), we set ans =-100LL. Now, compiling and potential issues:\n\n- Need to read the inputs for a,b,c,d correctly. Each line gives four numbers, right? The problem states that each query has a, b, c, d? From the Java code, in the for loop:\n\nfor each i:\n\na[i] = sc.nextInt() -1; \n\nb[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\nc[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nd[i] = sc.nextInt(); So each input line for the q entries has four numbers, which are the a (before -1), the b, then c, then d. So for each of q lines, the four numbers are to be read and stored. Wait sc.nextInt(), four times per iteration, so each loop iteration reads four integers. So in C, that's:\n\nfor (i =0; i < q; i++){\n\n   a[i] = ... \n\n}\n\nWait the way in C:\n\nfor (i =0; i < q; i++) {\n\n   int aa = scanf(\"%d % d % d % d\", &x, &y, &cc, &dd);\n\n   a[i] = x-1;\n\n   b[i] = y-1;\n\n   c[i] = cc;\n\n   d[i] = dd;\n\n}\n\nBut actually:\n\nWait:\n\nWait in the code, each input line (each of the q lines) for the queries has four numbers (a, b, c, d?), so each line is four numbers. So in the code:\n\nfor i from 0 to q-1:\n\n    a[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\n    b[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\n    c[i] = sc.nextint();\n\n    d[i] = sc.nextint(); Yes. So in C, in the loop, read four numbers. Wait so:\n\nBut in C, how to read those. Let me write it step by step:\n\nfor (int i =0; i< q; i++) {\n\n    int temp_a, temp_b, temp_c, temp_d;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &temp_a, &temp_b, &temp_c, &temp_d);\n\n    a[i] = temp_a -1;\n\n    b[i] = temp_b -1;\n\n    c[i] = temp_c;\n\n    d[i] = temp_d;\n\n}\n\nWait that's possible. Thus, the code would be okay. Now, dynamically allocated arrays: In C, the a,b,c,d arrays must be pointers to int. So:\n\nint *a;\n\nint *b;\n\nint *c;\n\nint *d; Then, in main:\n\na = (int*) malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n\nsame for the rest. But after that, when exiting main, it's an idea to free those memory. But in code, since it's problem submission, it's optional but might be needed to prevent memory leak. But for code submission, probably not necessary, but better to include. Wait but for problem submission, in coding contests, freeing isn't required, just the program output matters. Thus, code can include, but perhaps let's proceed. Now, putting all together. Structuring the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint *a = NULL;\nint *b = NULL;\nint *c = NULL; int *d = NULL;\nint n, m, q;\nlong long ans = -100LL;\n\nvoid dfs(int current[], int pos){\n\n    if(pos == n) {\n\n        long long score =0;\n        for(int i=0; i < q; i++){\n\n            if(current[b[i]] - current[a[i]] == c[i]){\n                score += d[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        if(score > ans){\n            ans = score;\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // get start_num\n    int start_num;\n\n    if( pos ==0 ){\n        start_num =1;\n    }else{\n        start_num = current[pos-1];\n    }\n\n    for( int num = start_num; num <= m; num++ ){\n\n        current[pos] = num;\n        dfs(current, pos+1);\n\n    }\n}\n\nint main(){\n\n    scanf(\"%d % d %d\", &n, &m, &q);\n\n    a = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    b = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    c = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    d = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for(int i=0; i < q; i++){\n\n        int temp_a, temp_b, temp_c, temp_d;\n        scanf(\"%d % d % d % d\", &temp_a, &temp_b, &temp_c, &temp_d);\n        a[i] = temp_a -1;\n        b[i] = temp_b -1;\n        c[i] = temp_c;\n        d[i] = temp_d;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize current array.

Testing edge cases:\n\nTest case when n=1, m=1, q=0 (but probably the problem constraints say q>=1?), but assuming valid input. Suppose n=1, m=1: input like:\n\n1 1 0\n\nThen the code would do a loop in dfs:\n\ncurrent has size 1. For pos=0: start_num is 1. Then the for loop starts and loops runs with num=1. Set current[0]=1, call dfs with pos=1 (since n=1, then enters the if(pos==n case. Then the sum is 0, since q is 0. So ans would be max between -100 and 0 \u2192 0. So output is 0, but ans was initialized as -100, so replaces it with 0. Wait wait, when q is 0?",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's see. The Java program is solving some problem where they're generating all possible sequences of numbers from 1 to m of length n, and calculating a score based on certain conditions. The maximum score is stored in 'ans'. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking.\n\nHmm, so in C, I need to mimic this functionality. First, I'll note the main components of the Java code. There are static variables for a, b, c, d arrays, n, m, q, and ans. The main function reads input from stdin, initializes the arrays, then calls a DFS function which builds up the list of integers. The DFS function recursively builds the list, checking when it reaches size n to compute the score, then backtracking.\n\nNow, in C, we can't have static variables in the same way because there's no concept of 'static' variables in functions if they're not declared as global. Wait, actually, static variables in C are possible. Alternatively, since all variables are static in the Java code here (as class variables), they can be translated as global variables in C to maintain the same behavior.\n\nFirst, the arrays a, b, c, d in Java are all of type int. In C, those can be arrays too, with size q. Also, the variables n, m, q and ans are global. The main function will do the same as in Java.\n\nBut in C, since there's no ArrayList, the list in the Java code (ArrayList<Integer>) needs to be handled differently. The ArrayList is used to build the current sequence, which in this case is a list of integers of length up to n. So in C, perhaps an array of size n can track the current elements. The way DFS works, each recursive call adds another element to the current list until it reaches the desired length.\n\nIn the Java's DFS function, when the list's size is n, compute score.\n\nIn C, the parameters might be passed as an array and a current length. Since in each call, we build a list that's of increasing order because the next number starts at or after the previous element. Looking at the Java code's DFS:\n\nThe list is built in non-decreasing order? Wait, let me see the loop: When adding, if the list is not empty, the next number starts from the last number's value and goes up to m. So for instance, first element can be from 1 to m. The next element can start at the last element's value (so allowing same or increment). This is equivalent to generating all possible non-decreasing sequences of length n where each element is between 1 and m.\n\nAh right. So the recursive function in C would need an array (let's say called current) of size n, and an integer indicating the current index or the length.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Declare global variables for a, b, c, d, n, m, q, ans.\n\nWait, in C, arrays have to have fixed sizes, but in Java, the arrays are initialized in main. Since q is read first from input, perhaps we need to declare pointers and allocate memory dynamically for a, b, c, d arrays. Wait, but in Java they are static and initialized in main based on input. So in C, perhaps we have a, b, c, d as global arrays but their size will be determined at runtime, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, in C, since arrays can't have variable sizes unless they're allocated dynamically. So perhaps declare them as pointers which are allocated once the q is known.\n\nWait the code first reads q, then creates a and the other arrays with size q. So we need to in C declare the arrays as pointers, then after reading q from input, allocate memory for them with malloc.\n\nYes. So the first step: declare those arrays as pointers.\n\nThe global variables would be:\n\nint *a;\nint *b;\nint *c;\nint *d;\nint n;\nint m;\nint q;\nlong long ans; // Since Java uses 'long' (64 bits). In C, that might need 'long long' to hold it, especially given the constraints.\n\nWait java code uses a 'long' (since ans is initialized to -100L). So in C, using 'long long ans' would be better to prevent overflow.\n\nThe main function does the following:\n\n1. Read n, m, q from standard input. So using scanf in main.\n\n2. Allocate memory to a, b, c, d as arrays of size q.\n\nWait, the code in java uses [q] so size q elements. So in C: a = malloc(q * sizeof(int)); or similar.\n\nThen, read in the q lines into the arrays a, b, c, d, similar to the Java code. Note that in Java code, a[i] = sc.nextInt() -1; so in C, the a array must be 0-based for the indices. Since input numbers are 1-based in the problem?\n\nProbably in the problem statements, the inputs for a and b are 1-based (like \"the i-th condition says the difference between the b-th element and a-th element is...\" so subtracting 1 to convert to 0-based indices.\n\nSo in C, same as in Java: the user enters numbers which after minus 1 become array indices.\n\nNow, the main function then calls dfs with an empty list. But in C, how to represent the list?\n\nThe list in Java is building a sequence of integers, each step appending a number such that the sequence is non-decreasing. So, for example, the first element can be from 1 to m, then next element can be from the previous element's number up to m, etc. So the list's length is the depth.\n\nThus, the current sequence can be maintained as an array of integers. Let's have a current array of size n. So in C, maybe pass an array and its current length as parameters to the recursive function.\n\nAlternatively, track the next position to set. So the recursive function could take the current array, and the current index (like the step of the sequence being built), and recursively fill elements.\n\nLet me sketch a possible structure.\n\nDefine the current sequence as an array of size n, let's say int current[n]. But n is a variable from input. Wait, variable-length arrays in C are allowed in C99 if the compiler supports it, but an alternative approach is to use a dynamically allocated array. Hmm, since n is read from input, but in static variables (so once the input is read, n is set). Maybe it's better to have a buffer allocated for n elements, as part of the stack.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array.\n\nAlternatively, the recursive function can use an array with current length as a parameter, but passing the current array with a level parameter.\n\nHmm, perhaps:\n\nThe dfs function can have parameters like the current array and current level (index). Each time, the function adds the next number appropriately.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step:\n\nGlobal variables:\n\nint *a;\nint *b;\nint *c;\nint *d;\nint n, m, q;\nlong long ans;\n\nIn main:\n\nRead n, m, q using scanf.\n\nAllocate memory for a, b, c, d: each is size q. So:\n\na = malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n\nSame for the others. Don't forget to check if allocation failed.\n\nThen read each of q lines:\n\nfor (i from 0 to q-1) {\n\n   read a[i], b[i], c[i], d[i].\n\n   a[i] = a_input-1;\n\n   b[i] = b_input-1;\n\n}\n\nThen call the recursive function. But the current sequence is built via an array, so maybe start the recursion like:\n\nthe initial call is with current array index 0, and current array, etc.\n\nWait, let me think of the structure of the DFS.\n\nOriginal Java function:\n\npublic static void dfs(ArrayList<Integer> list) {\n\nIf list's size is n, then compute score, etc.\n\nElse if list is empty: 1st element can start from 1 to m.\n\nelse:\n\nFor loop from num = previous element's value to m.\n\nWait in C, to track the sequence, perhaps the function can take an array and a current position (the next empty spot to place, or the current length), so length is the current index.\n\nIn the initial call, length is 0. When building the sequence, the next number has to start from previous (the last element, which is at index length-1), and go up to m. Except for first iteration (when length is 0, first number can be 1 to m).\n\nWait the non-decreasing sequences. Because when not empty, the next number can start at the previous number's value.\n\nSo, the current sequence is stored in an array, say, current[], and the current length is the current deepest in the recursion. So:\n\nThe function could be something like:\n\nvoid dfs(int current[], int pos) {\n\n    if (pos ==n) { compute the score, compare with ans. }\n\n    else:\n\n        num starts from the previous_num's value if pos >0 else starts at 1.\n\n        up to m.\n\n}\n\nWait, how does this work? Let's see:\n\nInitially, pos is 0. Then, for the first element (pos 0):\n\nThe previous number is nothing. So the first element can be from 1 to m.\n\nSo in that case:\n\nfor (num =1; num <= m; num++) {\n\ncurrent[0] = num;\n\nthen call dfs(current, pos+1);\n\n}\n\nThen, in the next step, for pos ==1, the previous number was current[0], so the next can start from current[0] up to m.\n\nWait, but how to handle that? Let's see the loop in the recursive function:\n\nStart at num = lower (could be previous value)\n\nloop from num= lower up to m.\n\nSo when pos is 0, the lower is 1 (since 1 is first start).\n\nWait for the first position (pos=0): the lower is initial number 1, and we go up to m.\n\nThen, when pos = k (k>0), lower is current[k-1], and the next numbers can start at lower, up to m.\n\nWait in the original Java code, the non-empty check is as follows:\n\nif ( list is empty (then else path):\n\n   first number is from 1.\n\nOtherwise, the next numbers start from list.get(list.size()-1).\n\nSo the same condition applies.\n\nIn C:\n\nIn function dfs, parameter pos represents the current position (0-based). The current array has elements 0 to pos-1 filled, and we are choosing the next element (pos) in current[0..pos].\n\nWait, perhaps the function is called with pos indicating how many elements have been filled so far, so the next position to fill is pos. \n\nSo for example, when pos is 0, the array is empty. When pos reaches n, we have to compute the score.\n\nSo the function signature would be:\n\nvoid dfs(int *current, int pos) { ... }\n\nSo the current array is passed along with the current position.\n\nTherefore, the base case is when pos == n, compute the score.\n\nFor recursive steps:\n\nprevious_num is current[pos-1], if pos >0 else undefined.\n\nif pos ==0:\n\nthe first number can be from 1 to m.\n\nelse the next number must be >= previous_num and <= m.\n\nSo, the loop for next_num would start at (pos>0 ? current[pos-1] : 1), up to m.\n\nWait, but the next_num can go from previous_num to m, inclusive.\n\nThus, in the loop:\n\nint start_num = (pos ==0) ? 1 : current[pos-1];\n\nfor (int next_num = start_num; next_num <=m; next_num++){\n\n    current[pos] = next_num;\n\n    dfs(current, pos+1);\n\n}\n\nThis may not be correct. Let's see.\n\nWait, for example, if current is [1], when pos was 1 (since next_num starts at start_num=current[0]=1. So the next can be 1,2 etc up to m. That's correct.\n\nHowever, when starting, for example, first element, the next_num can start at 1, and in each loop step can choose 1 up to m, and then for each that, recursively try adding numbers starting from that number.\n\nYes, that's exactly the approach needed. So this logic works for the sequence building.\n\nNow the next thing to write: the score. So when pos is n:\n\nscore starts at 0. Then for each i from 0 to q-1:\n\nif (current[b[i]] - current[a[i]] == c[i]) then add d[i] to score.\n\nWait, indexes: in Java, the variables a[i] and b[i] are stored as 0-based since the code subtracted 1. The current holds the actual elements in 0-based array (current[0] to current[n-1]?)\n\nWait in Java, list is stored as an ArrayList, so for pos 0, list.get(0) is first element. So when building to n elements, list has list.size() == n, so that's the end. Then for each condition (i in 0..q-1):\n\nlist.get(b[i]) - list.get(a[i]) must equal c[i], then add d[i].\n\nSo in C, current is an array of size n, indexes 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, no, in C's current array, the size is n, so elements are current[0] to current[n-1]. So for each i from 0 to q-1:\n\nif ( current[ b[i] ] - current[ a[i] ] == c[i] ) --> then add d[i].\n\nThus, that's relatively straightforward.\n\nNow, about the array current: in C, how do we create it.\n\nSince it's passed as a parameter, we can make the initial call with a current array of size n, initialized in some way.\n\nThe initial call would be made with the current array, starting at pos 0.\n\nBut the array needs to exist, so perhaps we can allocate it locally on the stack in main and pass it along?\n\nWait in C, if main is called, and n is variable, the array can be of variable length if using C99 syntax.\n\nSo in main:\n\nint current[n];\n\nYes, but only if n is known. Since in main, we read n first before calling dfs. So yes, in C, a variable length array (VLA) is possible here. So in main:\n\nvoid main() {\n\n   ... read from stdin n, m, q.\n\n   then allocate a to be arrays of q elements each.\n\n   ... read inputs.\n\n   int current[n];\n\n   ans = -100LL;\n\n   dfs(current, 0);\n\n   ...print etc.\n\n}\n\nThat would work. But the recursion is going to use this current array? But the function is called recursively with the current array. Wait, but the function's stack would propagate the array. Wait, when passing arrays as parameters, in C it's passed as a pointer, so the current array is the same array to all recursive calls. That would actually modify the same current array.\n\nBut wait, the backtracking is crucial here. So in the current approach, the function replaces values and then must undo those values.\n\nWait the way the Java code does it is:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nlist.add(num)\n\nrecursive call\n\nlist.remove ... \n\nThus, each path builds the list and backtracks by removing.\n\nIn the current approach in C (using array and pos):\n\nEach time, current[pos] is set to the next_num, then passed to dfs(...). But when that returns, the variable current[pos] should be the same as before.\n\nBut in the loop, in C:\n\nfor (next_num from start_num to m):\n\ncurrent[pos] = next_num;\n\ndfs( current, pos+1 );\n\nBut when the function returns (after recursion), we need to ensure that the current array is in the same state as before. However, in this approach, since the array is a reference (pointer), the changes to current[pos] inside the recursive calls overwrite the same array.\n\nTherefore, this approach may not work, because when you back out of the recursive calls, current[pos] is set back to the value of the next_num in the previous step of the loop, so you need to not retain the current position. \n\nWait but the recursion uses a different level's position. So this approach may be fine. Because when the function is called with pos, the next step fills current[pos], and when returning from a deeper level (pos+1) then we can loop back to try a new next_num, and set current[pos] again. Wait, but in the loop:\n\nfor (next_num = start... up to m){\n\n    current[pos] = next_num; \n\n    call dfs with pos+1;\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nWait after the dfs returns, current[pos] remains as next_num. But next loop iteration will overwrite it with next_num's next value. So that's okay. Then, once the for loop is over, the function can return, and the upper levels will have other parts of current array (like current[pos-1], which is still preserved.\n\nWait, no, because in the current[pos] is part of the original array. So the problem is not there. So the variables in the array are part of the same array, so the setting of current[pos] when backtracking can be left as it is. Wait but the main point is that for the next steps, when we loop back through the for loop, we overwrite the current value each time.\n\nAh, right, because each element in the loop over next_num, you set current[pos] to the new next_num, do a dfs, then after that returns, you can move to the next iteration.\n\nThat works.\n\nWait let me see with an example.\n\nSuppose the first level is pos = 0. Iterating next_num from 1 to m.\n\nFirst iteration: current[0] = 1, call dfs with pos =1.\n\nWhile in the deeper calls (pos 1), the current array's elements 1 are filled with values, etc. When that returns back to the for loop (after returning from the dfs call for next_num=1), the next step would be next_num=2, then current[0] is set to 2, and the same process repeats. But the previous values in current[0] (1) are overwritten. However, since when we return, the next_num=2 isn't 'replaced' but rather just written over. So since after the previous next_num=1, the pos+1 (1) has been handled and returned, it's okay.\n\nWait the point is that after the dfs returns, the current array's current[pos] (in the current level) is set to next_num (the current step of the loop's iteration), which is required, since we are trying all next_num. Then when the loop exits, the current array is back to whatever it was before this for loop, except that the current[pos] may have the last next_num.\n\nWait but actually, when you call the for loop:\n\nIn each iteration, the current[pos] is set to next_num. So after the loop ends, current[pos] is the final next_num from the last loop iteration. But that's okay, because the function's state has to return to the parent.\n\nWait but in backtracking, how is that handled?\n\nActually, in the approach, the array is being modified in place. Each recursive step modifies the current array at the current position, and then the loop proceeds, so that the next step in the loop will overwrite the next_num. Thus, the backtracking is automatically handled by the function returning from the recursion and continuing with the for loop.\n\nTherefore, the approach of using a single array and just overwriting the values at current position, and letting the for loop handle the backtracking, because when the loop re-enters the for, the current[pos] is set to a new next_num, overwriting the previous one, works.\n\nThus, this approach should work. So the recursive function can be written as:\n\nvoid dfs(int *current, int pos) {\n\n   if (pos == n) {\n\n      long long score =0;\n\n      for (int i =0; i < q; i++) {\n\n          if( (current[ b[i] ] - current[ a[i] ] ) == c[i] ){\n\n                score += d[i];\n\n          }\n\n      }\n\n      if(score>ans) ans = score;\n\n      return;\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n      int start_num = (pos ==0) ? 1 : current[pos-1];\n\n      for(int num= start_num; num <= m; num++) {\n\n          current[pos] = num;\n\n          dfs(current, pos+1);\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, but variables: the loop's i and num should be declared inside the function.\n\nYes. Wait variables in C can be declared within the for loop like in C99 (with the for (int i...)), which is okay.\n\nWait when in the function, the 'for(int num=... )', then in each iteration, you set current[pos]=num, then call dfs with pos+1.\n\nIn this way, since the recursion handles the next level, and the loop's num variable will handle all possible numbers.\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo the structure is okay. Now, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, when q is zero? Probably not, but the problem probably states that q >=1.\n\nBut according to the code structure, when q is zero, the code won't process any conditions. But probably handled.\n\nNow, the initial variables:\n\nIn Java, the variables a,b,c,d are initialized to null, then in main's start they are created. In C, since they are pointers allocated after reading q, which is done correctly. Also, the ans is initialized as -100 in Java, so in the code, same for C. So in main, before calling dfs(current,0), we set ans =-100LL.\n\nNow, compiling and potential issues:\n\n- Need to read the inputs for a,b,c,d correctly. Each line gives four numbers, right? The problem states that each query has a, b, c, d? From the Java code, in the for loop:\n\nfor each i:\n\na[i] = sc.nextInt() -1; \n\nb[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\nc[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nd[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nSo each input line for the q entries has four numbers, which are the a (before -1), the b, then c, then d. So for each of q lines, the four numbers are to be read and stored.\n\nWait sc.nextInt(), four times per iteration, so each loop iteration reads four integers. So in C, that's:\n\nfor (i =0; i < q; i++){\n\n   a[i] = ... \n\n}\n\nWait the way in C:\n\nfor (i =0; i < q; i++) {\n\n   int aa = scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x, &y, &cc, &dd);\n\n   a[i] = x-1;\n\n   b[i] = y-1;\n\n   c[i] = cc;\n\n   d[i] = dd;\n\n}\n\nBut actually:\n\nWait:\n\nWait in the code, each input line (each of the q lines) for the queries has four numbers (a, b, c, d?), so each line is four numbers. So in the code:\n\nfor i from 0 to q-1:\n\n    a[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\n    b[i] = sc.nextInt() -1;\n\n    c[i] = sc.nextint();\n\n    d[i] = sc.nextint();\n\nYes. So in C, in the loop, read four numbers. Wait so:\n\nBut in C, how to read those. Let me write it step by step:\n\nfor (int i =0; i< q; i++) {\n\n    int temp_a, temp_b, temp_c, temp_d;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &temp_a, &temp_b, &temp_c, &temp_d);\n\n    a[i] = temp_a -1;\n\n    b[i] = temp_b -1;\n\n    c[i] = temp_c;\n\n    d[i] = temp_d;\n\n}\n\nWait that's possible.\n\nThus, the code would be okay.\n\nNow, dynamically allocated arrays:\n\nIn C, the a,b,c,d arrays must be pointers to int. So:\n\nint *a;\n\nint *b;\n\nint *c;\n\nint *d;\n\nThen, in main:\n\na = (int*) malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n\nsame for the rest. But after that, when exiting main, it's an idea to free those memory. But in code, since it's problem submission, it's optional but might be needed to prevent memory leak. But for code submission, probably not necessary, but better to include.\n\nWait but for problem submission, in coding contests, freeing isn't required, just the program output matters.\n\nThus, code can include, but perhaps let's proceed.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nStructuring the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint *a = NULL;\nint *b = NULL;\nint *c = NULL;\nint *d = NULL;\nint n, m, q;\nlong long ans = -100LL;\n\nvoid dfs(int current[], int pos){\n\n    if(pos == n) {\n\n        long long score =0;\n        for(int i=0; i < q; i++){\n\n            if(current[b[i]] - current[a[i]] == c[i]){\n                score += d[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        if(score > ans){\n            ans = score;\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // get start_num\n    int start_num;\n\n    if( pos ==0 ){\n        start_num =1;\n    }else{\n        start_num = current[pos-1];\n    }\n\n    for( int num = start_num; num <= m; num++ ){\n\n        current[pos] = num;\n        dfs(current, pos+1);\n\n    }\n}\n\nint main(){\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &m, &q);\n\n    a = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    b = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    c = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n    d = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for(int i=0; i < q; i++){\n\n        int temp_a, temp_b, temp_c, temp_d;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &temp_a, &temp_b, &temp_c, &temp_d);\n        a[i] = temp_a -1;\n        b[i] = temp_b -1;\n        c[i] = temp_c;\n        d[i] = temp_d;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize current array. Since n is known here, can do a VLA.\n    int current[n];\n    dfs(current,0);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n    // Free the allocated memory.\n    free(a);\n    free(b);\n    free(c);\n    free(d);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, I think this should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case when n=1, m=1, q=0 (but probably the problem constraints say q>=1?), but assuming valid input.\n\nSuppose n=1, m=1:\n\ninput like:\n\n1 1 0\n\nThen the code would do a loop in dfs:\n\ncurrent has size 1. For pos=0: start_num is 1. Then the for loop starts and loops runs with num=1.\n\nSet current[0]=1, call dfs with pos=1 (since n=1, then enters the if(pos==n case. Then the sum is 0, since q is 0. So ans would be max between -100 and 0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo output is 0, but ans was initialized as -100, so replaces it with 0.\n\nWait wait, when q is 0? The loop for the score would run zero times \u2192 score 0. So if the code has a valid condition, then yes.\n\nWait but the problem's constraints likely require but here in code it's handled.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nLet\u2019s say an example from the problem ABIC coding problem C from ABC165.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2 2\n\n1 2 0 1\n\n2 3 1 2\n\nSample Output 1: 3\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn this case:\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\nThe two conditions:\n\nFirst: a=1 becomes a[0]=0, b=2 \u2192 b[0] =1 (since 2 becomes 2-1=1). Difference should be 0 (c[0]=0) \u2192 So the score for this condition would be d=1 added if current[1] - current[0] is 0.\n\nSecond condition: 2 \u2192 a[1]=1, 3 \u2192 b[1]=2. c=1 \u2192 the difference between current[2] and current[1] should be exactly 1. If so, add d=2.\n\nThe possible sequences of length 3 with non-decreasing elements between 1 and 2. The sequences must be non-decreasing, so possible sequences are:\n\n[1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,2], [2,2,2].\n\nAlso, [1,2,2] and others:\n\nTesting each sequence:\n\nFor sequence [1,1,2]:\n\nWait wait, sequences must be non-decreasing. So 1,1,2 is valid. Let's check:\n\nFor the first condition: entry 0 (indices 0 and 1). current[1]-current[0] =1-1=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 +1.\n\nFor the second condition (indices 1 and 2): current[2] - current[1] is 2-1 =1 \u2192 equals c[1] (which is 1). So +2. Total score:3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code should find this.\n\nBut let's see how the code works.\n\nWhen sequence is [1,1,2], the score is 1+2 =3.\n\nOther sequences like [1,1,1], the first condition gives +1, but second condition difference between elements 1 and2 (current[1]=1 and current[2]=1: difference 0, so no. Thus the second condition not met, total is1.\n\nAnother sequence like [1,2,2]: first condition: current[1]-current[0] is 1 \u2192 not 0. So first condition not met, second condition gives +2: total 2.\n\nThe sequence [1,1,2] gives score 3.\n\nSo yes. So the maximum is 3.\n\nNow let's see in code.\n\nBut the code's current array would capture this.\n\nThe code's DFS would indeed generate all the non-decreasing sequences and compute the scores.\n\nThus, I think the C code works.\n\nAdditionally, note that when m is 1000 and n is 15 (for example), the code might be slower, but in the problem's context, it's possible that the constraints are such that this is acceptable. But perhaps for such cases the code is expected to work, but in any case, the code as written is a direct translation.\n\nWait, but wait one thing: in C, the maximum stack depth for the recursion.\n\nFor example, when n is 15 and m is 1000, the recursion depth is 15. That should be okay since stack size can handle that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
