However, the code I have doesn't have that.\n\nLet me check the code again.\n\nLooking at my current code:\n\nInside the while loop, no local variables other than f and t (but f and t are declared outside).\n\nWait, f and t are declared before the loop, so inside the loop, the code does not have any variables declared.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote, I removed the 'sum' variable. So no variables declared inside the loop. The code only has f and t declared outside, and max also. So that should be okay in all versions.\n\nSo yes, this code should work.\n\nTherefore, the final C code is as above. I'll write that in the answer."
