Because, for example, if c is greater than A, and d is greater than B, then the first part would be ans = part *d, then then if d > B, it would be ans = ans + (part *c). So the code is allowed, but in Java, the second part adds the term. Ah right.

Wait let me re-express the code:\n\nInside the nested loops (past the continue):\n\nans is initialized to 0. First, if c> A:\n\npart = dp[c-1][d]\n\nans = part *d (overwrites the 0, so ans is now part*d ? Yes. So then after this if block, ans holds part*d. Then the next if: if (d> B), get the part from left, and add (part *c) to ans . So ans becomes (part *d) + (part2 *c) ? Wait part here is dp[c][d-1]\n\nWait the code is:\n\nif (d>B) {\n\n   part = dp[c][d-1]\n\n   ans += part *c Yes, so ans = (ans) + (current_part * c) So that part adds. Then the subtraction part, if c and d are both above, subtract the overlapping term. The formula is a bit complex, but translating to C's code. So in code, in C:\n\nInside the loops (c and d loops):\n\n    if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n    long long ans = 0;\n\n    if (c > A) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c-1][d];\n\n        ans = part *d;\n\n    }\n\n    if (d > B) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c][d-1];\n\n        ans += part *c; // add this to previous ans\n\n    }\n\n    if (c > A && d > B) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c-1][d-1];\n\n        ans -= part * (c-1) * (d-1);\n\n    }\n\n    // Now mod handling:\n\n    dp[c][d] = (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD; \n\nWait yes, this is same as (ans % MOD) to handle negative numbers, adding MOD before mod again.

Putting it all together:\n\nThe code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define MOD 998244353LL\n\nlong long dp[3001][3001]; \n\nvoid solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {\n\n    // Initialize dp[A][B] to 1\n\n    dp[A][B] = 1;\n\n    for (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n        for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n            if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n            long long ans = 0;\n\n            if (c > A) {\n\n                long long part = dp[c -1][d];\n\n                ans = part * d;\n\n            } if (d > B) {\n\n                long long part = dp[c][d -1];\n\n                ans += part * c;\n\n            }\n\n            if (c > A && d > B) {\n\n                // subtract the overlapping term\n\n                long long part = dp[c-1][d-1];\n\n                ans -= part * (c-1) * (d-1);\n\n            }\n\n            ans = (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD;\n\n            dp[c][d] = ans;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    int A, B, C, D;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &A, &B, &C, &D);\n\n    solve(A, B, C, D);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\", dp[C][D]);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait but wait: the indexes in the loop.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me start by looking through the Java code to understand what it does. The problem seems to be something related to dynamic programming because there's a 2D dp array. The class has a solve method that reads inputs A, B, C, D, initializes the dp array, and then fills it up with some calculations. The main method creates a Scanner and PrintWriter, calls solve, then closes everything.\n\nFirst step is to map the Java classes and structures to C equivalents. Since Java uses objects and classes, but C is procedural, I'll have to adjust for that. The Scanner and PrintWriter in Java are for I/O. In C, I can use standard input/output functions like scanf and printf.\n\nThe dp array in Java is a 2D array of longs with dimensions 3001x3001. Since C uses static arrays, I'll need to declare a 2D array. But in C, arrays are typically either rows of pointers to arrays (non-contiguous) or a single block (contiguous). Given that the Java code uses a fixed size of 3001, I can make a 2D array with fixed sizes.\n\nWait, in C, a 2D array can be declared as long dp[3001][3001]; but the dimensions are 3001 x 3001, which is a bit large. Is that going to be okay? Maybe, but I should check, but since the problem is according to the Java code's constraints, let's proceed.\n\nThe MOD is 998244353, same as a constant. In C, constants are often defined with #define or just static const. Let's use static const int or something.\n\nThe solve function takes a Scanner and PrintWriter, which in C terms need to read from stdin and write to stdout. The equivalent would be that the function will take the input via scanf and outputs via printf, but maybe to make it similar, perhaps pass in a pointer to data, but in this case since it's a single function, perhaps the variables can be handled with global variables? Hmm.\n\nWait, the Java code uses instance variables for MOD and dp. Since in C-struct, I need to make these variables. Alternatively, since in C, we can have global variables. Let me think:\n\nLet me plan:\n\n1. Constants:\n   - MOD should be a constant: #define MOD 998244353\n   - The DP array can be a global variable declared as long dp[3001][3001]; since it's a static array.\n\n2. The solve function in Java uses Scanner and PrintWriter, but in C, perhaps the solve function can just be a function that reads inputs via scanf and writes via printf. However, the original Java function's parameters are Scanner and PrintWriter. In C, passing these objects around would be tricky since they're Java-specific. Since in C, the stdio functions are generally used directly, perhaps the solve function can take no parameters and read from stdin, but in this case, maybe better to use a main function that calls the solve function which itself reads/writes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the C code can have the main function read the inputs, pass them as variables (A,B,C,D) to solve, but let's see.\n\nWait, the Java code's solve function reads A, B, C, D from the Scanner. The C code's main function can read those values, then pass them to a solve function. Let me think through the functions.\n\nReorganizing:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\n- The class has a dp array and MOD as instance variables.\n\n- The solve method is the core logic.\n\nSo in the C version, to replicate this:\n\n- Have a global dp array and MOD.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nGlobal variables in C:\n\n- #define MOD 998244353L (Wait, MOD is a 32-bit number? Wait MOD is 998244353 which is less than 2^30, so can be stored as int or long. Since Java uses long, in C, since dp is in long, maybe the calculations need to be 64 bits. So perhaps using long long would be safer. Wait, need to check: 3001x3001 is 9,003,001 elements. Each being a 64-bit number (8 bytes) would be about 72MB, which is acceptable, but maybe okay as a static array.\n\nHmm, so the array in C should be declared as:\n\nlong long dp[3001][3001]; \n\nWait because Java uses a long (64 bits), so in C using long may not always be 64 bits (depends on system; using long long is better for 64 bits. Although in most modern systems, long is 64 bits on 64-bit systems, but to be safe, better use long long.)\n\nWait, the Java code's dp is long (64 bits), so in C, perhaps the variables should be 'long long' to match. So in the C code:\n\nconst long long MOD = 998244353LL; \n\nWait, but with arrays, maybe better to use static const. Or maybe just define as const variables. Alternatively, use a global array initialized to 0?\n\nThe solve function in Java initializes dp[A][B] =1. Wait, but in C, the dp array needs to be initialized first. Since Java's dp is a 2D array declared as a class member, when the object is created, it's initialized to 0 (Java initializes all elements to 0 for arrays). In C, in a global array, similarly, all elements are initialized to 0 by default. So the C dp array can be declared as a global variable, initialized to 0.\n\nWait, in C, global variables are initialized to 0 unless specified otherwise. So we can declare it as:\n\nlong long dp[3001][3001] = {0}; or just let it be zero-initialized by default.\n\nNow, the solve function steps through c from A to C, and d from B to D. Wait, but the loop structure. Let me see the code more carefully:\n\nThe Java code's loops:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n    for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n        ...\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but this loops over c and d in the ranges. So in solve, the parameters need to be the inputs A,B,C,D. So perhaps, the C code's solve function can take those four integers as parameters.\n\nSo in main():\n\nint main() {\n\n    int A,B,C,D;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &A, &B, &C, &D);\n\n    solve(A,B,C,D);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\", dp[C][D]);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in that case, the solve function needs to read A etc. or parameters. Let me think:\n\nWait the original Java function starts with:\n\ndp[A][B] =1;\n\nThen loops over c from A to C, and for each, loops d from B to D.\n\nWait in the loops, when c starts at A and increments until C, so the first iteration for c can be A, and the d runs from B to D. The first element when c=A and d=B is handled with continue, but in that first iteration, when c is A and d is B, the code skips the rest of the calculation. Because in the initialization, dp[A][B] is set to 1 already, so the code is setting that, and then the loops to compute the rest.\n\nThus, the C code must replicate this.\n\nLet me plan the C structure:\n\nDeclare the global dp array and MOD.\n\nFunction solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {\n\n    Initialize dp[3000][3000] ... Wait, wait indices. Wait, in Java, the array starts at index 0. Wait the array in Java is declared as:\n\nlong[][] dp = new long[3001][3001];\n\nWhich creates an array from [0] to [3000]. So in C, the array is also 3001 x 3001, so indices from 0 to 3000.\n\nWait in the Java code, when the user inputs A, B, C, D, which must fit within those indices? Because otherwise, if the input values (like C or D) exceed 3000, the array would be out of bounds. But the problem was presumably designed so that the inputs are within the 1 to 3000 (or some constraints). But assuming the problem constraints are satisfied, so the code can proceed.\n\nWait, in the Java code's dp[A][B] =1, then the loops start with c =A, which can be up to 3000. So in C code, the same logic applies.\n\nThe solve function:\n\nvoid solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {\n\n    dp[A-1][B-1] or no. Wait, hold on: Java uses 0-based? No, in Java's case, the array is declared as [3001][3001], which allows indexes from 0 to 3000.\n\nWait the problem might have A and B starting at 1? Let me think.\n\nWait the initial assignment is dp[A][B] =1; because in Java the variables A and B read from input, and the code expects that. So in Java, the indices used for dp are exactly the input values. So if the input A is, say, 4, then dp[4][B] is used, so they are 1-based? Because perhaps the problem statement expects A, B etc. are 1-based indices, while the array is 0-based? No, that's a confusion.\n\nWait the array in Java is new long[3001][3001], so indexes are 0-based up to 3000 (since arrays are 0-based). But in the code, they start using A, B as 1-based? Because when the code initialize dp[A][B] =1, so expecting A and B to be between 0 and 3000 inclusive? Well, the problem input constraints must require that A and B are in the 3000+ but probably the problem says that the inputs are within 1 to 3000 or something. Because if A is up to 3000, then A can reach 3000, and 3000 is a valid index (since arrays go to 3000 as their max index).\n\nWait if someone inputs A=3001, that's beyond the array's limits and it will crash, but the problem must have constraints like 1 \u2264 A \u2264 C \u2264 3000, so that variables are within that.\n\nThus in C, the array will also be same indices, so when setting dp[A][B], so the same logic applies.\n\nSo back to code structure:\n\nGlobal variables:\n\nconst long long MOD = 998244353LL;\n\nlong long dp[3001][3001]; \n\nvoid solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {\n\n    // Initialize dp[A][B] to 1\n    dp[A][B] = 1;\n\n    // Iterate over c from A to C inclusive.\n    for (int c = A; c <=C; c++) {\n        for (int d = B ; d <= D ; d++) {\n            // Order of loops. Wait the loops in the original Java:\n\nLoop over c from A to C, and for each c, loop over d from B to D?\n\nWait in Java's code, the loops are:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n    for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, so for each c from the starting A to C, and for each d from the starting B to D. So the code processes each cell in order.\n\nWait but with that loop order, when processing a cell (c,d), the previous cells needed would be (c-1, d), (c, d-1), (c-1, d-1). However, if the loops are going from A to C and B to D, then the current cell was processed at an earlier time and their values are known.\n\nWait let me see in the Java code's logic:\n\nThe initial setup: set dp[A][B] = 1. Then, for each c from A to C (A being the current start):\n\nWait suppose c starts at A, and for each d from B to D. So for the first iteration of c (c is A), the first d is B. But in that case, the code's first loop iteration:\n\nif (c ==A and d==B) continue, so that cell has already been processed and set to 1.\n\nThen proceeding, for other cells.\n\nSo the code's loops seem to be correct. So in the loops, the current cell (c,d) is built from c-1, d, etc. which have been already processed earlier.\n\nWait the order of the loops may need to ensure that the previous steps in c and d are filled. So for the loops:\n\nEach c starts at the initial value and moves up, and each d similarly. For a given c, the inner loop on d increases d from B to D, so the cells in the current c row are processed left to right (from d starting at B to D). So for cell (c,d), anything above (c-1, d) is already processed. To the left (d-1) in same row may have been covered (since d starts at B and proceeds upwards, so for d > B, d-1 would have been done earlier).\n\nWait but first, for c = A:\n\nThen the d loops from B to D. The first step is c = A, d = B (skipped), then for d=B+1.\n\nWait for c = A and d> B, when processing (A, B+1):\n\nThe code uses the left neighbor (dp[c][d-1]) which would be (A, B), already initialized.\n\nSo the loop order seems to be okay.\n\nSo in C code, we can have the same loop structure.\n\nNow let's code the body of the solve function.\n\nStart in solve():\n\nFirst, set dp[A][B]=1.\n\nWait but note that in C, arrays are zero-based here as well, so if A and B are parameters (like when A is 0, but the problem might require A and B to be positive numbers. So assuming inputs are between 1 to 3000, but in this code, maybe variables can be up to 3000).\n\nNow, the loops:\n\nfor c from A to C:\n\nfor (c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n   for (d = B; d <= D; d++) { ... }\n\n}\n\nInside:\n\nif (c ==A and d ==B) continue.\n\nElse:\n\nlong long ans = 0;\n\nIf c >A: then add dp[c-1][d] *d (as in Java's part *d).\n\nWait code:\n\nans = part *d;\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nif (c > A) {\n\n    long part = dp[c -1][d]; \n\n    ans = (part *d);\n\n}\n\nWait no, then, if both conditions are true, like if the d also has increment, then ans is overwritten? Because, for example, if c is greater than A, and d is greater than B, then the first part would be ans = part *d, then then if d > B, it would be ans = ans + (part *c). So the code is allowed, but in Java, the second part adds the term.\n\nAh right. So the first if (c>A) block sets ans to part *d, then the next if (d>B) adds the other term; and the third if (c> A and d>B) subtracts the overlapping term.\n\nThus, in C, we need to compute ans similarly.\n\nWait let me parse the code:\n\nJava code:\n\nvoid solve(Scanner sc, PrintWriter pw) {\n\n    int A = ...;\n\n    ... \n\n    dp[A][B] =1;\n\n    for (c from A to C, ...) {\n\n        for (d from B to D, ... ) {\n\n            if (c ==A and d == B) continue.\n\n            long ans =0;\n\n            if (c >A) part = dp[c-1][d];\n\n            ans = part*d;\n\n            if (d > B) { part2 = dp[c][d-1]; \n\n                ans += part2 *c;\n\n            }\n\n            if (c>A and d >B) { \n\n                ans -= dp[c-1][d-1] * (c-1)*(d-1);\n\n            }\n\n            dp[c][d] = ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait but in code:\n\nWait the code in Java's block:\n\n    ans = (ans + (part * c));\n\nBecause \"ans = (ans + (part *c))\"?\n\nWait let me re-express the code:\n\nInside the nested loops (past the continue):\n\nans is initialized to 0.\n\nFirst, if c> A:\n\npart = dp[c-1][d]\n\nans = part *d (overwrites the 0, so ans is now part*d ?\n\nYes. So then after this if block, ans holds part*d.\n\nThen the next if: if (d> B), get the part from left, and add (part *c) to ans .\n\nSo ans becomes (part *d) + (part2 *c) ?\n\nWait part here is dp[c][d-1]\n\nWait the code is:\n\nif (d>B) {\n\n   part = dp[c][d-1]\n\n   ans += part *c \n\nYes, so ans = (ans) + (current_part * c)\n\nSo that part adds.\n\nThen the subtraction part, if c and d are both above, subtract the overlapping term.\n\nThe formula is a bit complex, but translating to C's code.\n\nSo in code, in C:\n\nInside the loops (c and d loops):\n\n    if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n    long long ans = 0;\n\n    if (c > A) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c-1][d];\n\n        ans = part *d;\n\n    }\n\n    if (d > B) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c][d-1];\n\n        ans += part *c; // add this to previous ans\n\n    }\n\n    if (c > A && d > B) {\n\n        long long part = dp[c-1][d-1];\n\n        ans -= part * (c-1) * (d-1);\n\n    }\n\n    // Now mod handling:\n\n    dp[c][d] = (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD; \n\nWait yes, this is same as (ans % MOD) to handle negative numbers, adding MOD before mod again.\n\nWait: The Java code does (ans % MOD)+ MOD and then mod again. That's to ensure the result is non-negative even if ans is negative.\n\nYes, so in C:\n\nBut in C, the modulo operator can behave differently for negatives, depending on the compiler. To be safe, we can do the same as the Java code.\n\nTherefore the C code's logic here is same.\n\nThus, the C code's code block for each cell (c,d) would look like that.\n\nThen, after the loops, the final value is dp[C][D], which needs to be printed. In the main function, after calling solve(A,B,C,D), we can print it.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define MOD 998244353LL\n\nlong long dp[3001][3001]; \n\nvoid solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {\n\n    // Initialize dp[A][B] to 1\n\n    dp[A][B] = 1;\n\n    for (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n        for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n            if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n            long long ans = 0;\n\n            if (c > A) {\n\n                long long part = dp[c -1][d];\n\n                ans = part * d;\n\n            }\n\n            if (d > B) {\n\n                long long part = dp[c][d -1];\n\n                ans += part * c;\n\n            }\n\n            if (c > A && d > B) {\n\n                // subtract the overlapping term\n\n                long long part = dp[c-1][d-1];\n\n                ans -= part * (c-1) * (d-1);\n\n            }\n\n            ans = (ans % MOD + MOD) % MOD;\n\n            dp[c][d] = ans;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    int A, B, C, D;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &A, &B, &C, &D);\n\n    solve(A, B, C, D);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\", dp[C][D]);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait but wait: the indexes in the loop. Wait in the Java code's dp[A][B] is being set, and loops go from A to C, etc.\n\nWait let me check if C's array is properly declared.\n\nYes, the array is 3001 elements in each dimension, so indices go from 0 to 3000, so as long as the variables A,B,C,D are within 0 to 3000 inclusive.\n\nAssuming that the problem's input constraints ensure that. So for the user inputs, for example, if they can be up to 3000, like in Java's problem.\n\nPotential issue: in Java, the code's initial A is the input, so if the input is 3000, the code is okay, as dp[3000][...] is accessible.\n\nNow, in C code as above, when we have:\n\nsolve(A, B, C, D) where these variables were read via scanf, so probably integers from 0 to 3000? Wait no, original Java code uses nextInt(), but input numbers are probably 1-based?\n\nWait the problem might have the input as 1-based or 0-based.\n\nWait in the problem's context, probably the variables A,B,C,D are given in 1-based indices. Wait let's think. Looking at the problem's code.\n\nIn the original Java code, the array indices are set to A and B directly. So if the input is A=3, then that's maps directly to dp[3][...] which is allowed.\n\nSo the Java code's dp array is zero-based, but the problem's inputs are 1-based?\n\nWait no, maybe not. For example, possible that input values can be up to 3000, and the array can store them (since indices go from 0 to 3000, a total of 3001 elements). So if the input A can be from 1 to 3000, then storing in dp[A][B] would be okay as indices 1 to 3000 (since C arrays can have 0, but the user inputs are 1-based? Or not. Maybe the problem expects the inputs from 0, but likely from 1.\n\nWait the problem's problem statement (AGC046 B) possibly defines the initial position as (A,B), and the target as (C,D), so the problem expects A,B,C,D as integers. The Java code's code uses variables without adding or subtracting 1, so perhaps the problem uses 1-based indices. But in any case, the code as written follows the problem's constraints correctly, so the C code must mirror exactly, assuming that the input is taken correctly (A up to 3000).\n\nThus, the code in C is okay.\n\nAnother check: The loop is nested in outer c and inner d. So if the outer loop is c from A to C, and each step's d loop from B to D. So that- the first cell is when c=A, d=B, which is skipped.\n\nWait the first cell in the loops where c=A is processed (when d starts as B?), but the code skips processing the (A,B) cell.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nWait, the (A,B) cell is set initially, and since in the loops, the (A,B) position is in the first iteration (when c=A and the d loop starts at B), the continue skips the code and the cell remains 1.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: In the Java code, the first assignment is dp[A][B]=1, but when the loops are entered, they also loop over c from A to C, which includes A. So the loops are going through all the cells. So the (A,B) is already handled.\n\nNow, in C code, the calculation for ans could have overflows? Since in Java, it's using long, but when multiplying large numbers, the result might overflow even for 64 bits. But in the code, the modulo is applied only after the calculations. Wait, the modulus was applied at the end.\n\nWait the original code for ans:\n\nans is built as:\n\nans is set to part *d, then add part*c, then subtract term. The problem is that the intermediate values may be huge, possibly larger than 64 bits. Like (c is up to 3000, d also up to 3000, so 3000 * 3000 multiplied by something).\n\nWait in the problem's solution, since all terms are modulo MOD, perhaps the code is designed so that the formula is correct modulo MOD? Or perhaps the calculation needs to be done mod MOD during the steps.\n\nWait the original code- lets think about the formula:\n\nthe value for dp[c][d] is computed as ( (part * d) + (part2 * c) - (part3 * (c-1)(d-1)) ) mod MOD.\n\nWhere each part is dp[c-1][d], which was previously modulo MOD. So since all the parts (dp arrays) have already been modded MOD in their calculation, when using those values, the term (part*d) could be up to MOD-1 multiplied by 3000, which could be up to ~ 3e9 * 2e9? Wait, but MOD is ~ 1e9, 3e9 multiplied by 3e3 is ~ 3e12, which would fit in a 64-bit integer (since 2^63 is about 9e18). So when computing the ans, it might be possible to compute this without overflow as long as the constants don't require more than 64 bits.\n\nWait let me see: Let's say the terms are all modulo MOD. The maximum possible value for (part * d) would be (MOD-1)* (up to D which is 3000) = (around 1e9) *3e3 = ~ 3e12. Which is way less than 2^63 (~9e18). So the calculation can be done in a signed 64-bit integer without overflow.\n\nThus, in C code using 'long long' (64 bits) is safe for these intermediate steps.\n\nSo the code as written should handle it.\n\nNow, edge cases: when c ==A or d== B.\n\nLike when c=A and d > B:\n\nOnly the second part (d>B) is handled. So the ans starts as 0 (since first if is false, because c is A), then when d> B:\n\nthe second if is true, so part is dp[c][d-1] (which for d=B+1, its d-1 is B, and c is A, so dp[A][B] =1. So ans would be 0 + (1 *A). Then since c is not >A, the other terms don't affect.\n\nSo that seems okay.\n\nNow, the code's first part: initializing the dp array? Are all other elements zero? Because in C's global arrays initialized to 0, so before the solve function, the dp array is all 0, then dp[A][B] is set to 1, and the rest are computed via the loops.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in main, after solve(A,B,C,D), the program prints dp[C][D].\n\nThus, the code should function equivalently to the Java code.\n\nI think that's the correct C translation.\n\nNow, I can write this and see if there are any typos.\n\nWait, in the loops: the loops for c from A to C and d from B to D. So the loops must iterate through each c starting at the given A, up to C, inclusive. So the loop is:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++).\n\nSimilarly for d. Since in C, with; inside the outer loop.\n\nAlso, in the line:\n\nans -= part * (c-1) * (d-1);\n\nThe subtract is part*( (c-1)*(d-1) ) but it's written as 'part multiplied by (c-1)*(d-1)'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo overall code is as above. Let me check the modulo part again:\n\ndp[c][d] = ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD;\n\nWhich is exactly what the Java code had.\n\nThus, the C code should work."
