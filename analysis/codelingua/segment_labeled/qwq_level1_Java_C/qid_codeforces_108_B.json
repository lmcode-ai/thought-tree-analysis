In Java, the loop runs from i=0 to a.length-1 (which would be 0) minus 1? Wait, a.length-1 when n=1 is 0, so the loop runs when i <0? Because a.length-1 is 0, so a.length-1 is 0; the loop goes from i=0 to 0-1= -1. So the loop doesn't run, so the code prints \"NO\", which is correct. In the C code, when n is 1, then n-1 is 0, so the loop runs from i=0 to 0 < 0, so no iteration, so the code proceeds to printf(\"NO\"), which is correct. Another test case: n=2 with elements 3 and 5. Then sorted becomes [3,5], a[0]=3, a[1]=5. 5 < 6 (3*2) is yes, so condition is true. So output is YES. Correct. Another test case where two elements equal? Like 2 and 2: sorted, check a[1] is 2, which is equal to a[0]. So the second condition a[i] ! = a[i+1] is false, so the condition is not met, so code proceeds to NO. Correct.

If such a pair exists, it prints \"YES\" and exits; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to do each part in C.\n\nStarting with the input: C doesn't have a Scanner class, so I'll use scanf. The main function will read n, then the array elements. \n\nNext, the array needs to be sorted. In C, the qsort function from stdlib.h can be used. But I need a comparison function. The default for integers is probably sufficient, since the default is to treat them as integers, but maybe I need to specify a comparator.

Let me note that after sorting, the array is in ascending order. So, the elements are sorted from smallest to largest. \n\nWait in the condition, a[i+1] comes after a[i] in the sorted array, which is sorted in increasing order. So each a[i+1] is >= a[i].

Wait, but if they are equal, the second condition makes sure that the first part (a[i+1] < a[i] *2) can not be true because a[i] and a[i+1] are equal, so the check is redundant?

Correct.\n\nAnother case where the numbers are 1 and 2: 2 < 2 (1*2)? 2 is not less than, so condition false. So output NO. But if numbers are 1 and 3? 3 is not less than 2, so NO. Wait, 1 and 1.5 (but input is integer), so perhaps 1 and 2 would return NO.\n\nWait, the condition is looking for if any pair has the next element less than double the current and not equal. So like 1 and 2, next element is not less than 2 (exactly equal to 2), so condition is false. 1 and 1 gives next element equal, so also false.\n\nOkay, so the code should work.\n\nNow, about the code structure. The C code uses malloc, which is necessary for dynamic array allocation.\n\nWait, but in C, the array size is fixed at compile time for regular arrays, but with malloc, it can be variable. \n\nWait in code above,_malloc of int array. The memory is freed before returning in the loop case and the else case. \n\nPotential memory leak if the code had other exits, but in this case, it's handled properly.\n\nSo that's the code. Let me check for any possible errors.\n\nWait, the return 0; after free(a); when printing YES? Because in C, when you return from main, the memory allocated with malloc might not automatically be cleaned up. But in this case, we're freeing before exit. (Well, when the process ends, the operating system releases the memory, but it's better practice to free if possible.)\n\nAnother possible issue is when the input n is zero? Well, the problem probably assumes n is at least 1, but the code would read n=0, allocate zero bytes, then crash when processing? Because for n=0, the program would immediately go to print \"NO\", but that loop runs when n-1 is -1, so i < -1 which is not executed. So then after that, the code would print NO. But in practice, if n is 0, the code may have undefined behavior when using a[ i ] but perhaps the problem expects n >=1.\n\nSo the code should handle n=0, but perhaps the problem constraints ensure n is positive.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
