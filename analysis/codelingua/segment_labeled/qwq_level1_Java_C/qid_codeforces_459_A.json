So in C:\n\nabs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)\n\nBecause the variables are integers, so the absolute values are computed as integers. But C's abs is fine here. Now, the debug function in Java is present but not used here. Since the problem doesn't require debugging info, in C we can omit that function. Putting it all into C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2; scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2); if (x1 == x2) {\n        int dif = abs(y1 - y2);\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2);\n    } else if (y1 == y2) {\n        int dif = abs(x1 - x2);\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif);\n    } else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) {\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1, y2, x2, y1);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in C, the functions must be in correct order. Also, checking for the conditions. Wait also, in the second condition, the code in Java does:\n\npw.println(x1 + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + x2 + \" \" + (y2 + dif)); So the first point is (x1, y1 + dif) and the second point is (x2, y2 + dif). So that's exactly what the C code has. Okay, that should work. Let me test possible cases. First case where x1 equals x2: Test 1: Input: 1 2 1 5\n\nHere, dif is |2-5| = 3. Output should be 1+3=4 for X, so 4 2 and 4 5. So output 4 2 4 5. Which is correct. Another case y1 == y2:\n\nTest 2: Input: 3 4 6 4\n\ndif is 3 (difference between 3 and 6). So output x1 is 3, y1 + dif = 4+3 =7. So 3 7, then x2 (6) and y2 + 3 = 7. So 6 7. The output is 3 7 6 7. Third case:\n\nTest 3:\n\nx1=1,y1=1, x2=3,y2=3. Absolute differences 2 and 2. So condition 3 applies. Output 1 3 and 3 1. Which is correct? Yes, so the code would output those. Fourth case:\n\nInput 1 1 2 3. The differences in x is 1, y is 2. Since they are not equal (1 !=2), then check if other conditions are met. Since x1 !=x2, and y1 != y2, then check (abs(x) vs abs(y) difference). So 1 vs 2, so not equal. So output -1. So code should print -1. Yes. Therefore the code seems correct. Wait one possible error: in the first condition, the code assumes that the direction is to move in the positive x-direction. For example, if y1 is higher than y2, the difference is y1-y2? Wait no, since it is absolute. Suppose y1=5, y2=2: dif is 3. Then adding to x1 would be x1 +3. Wait regardless of direction.",
