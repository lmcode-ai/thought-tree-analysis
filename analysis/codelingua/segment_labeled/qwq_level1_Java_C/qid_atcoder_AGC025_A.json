Then in the main function, it reads an integer N and does some computations to find the minimal sum of digits. So translating to C. Well, C uses functions, not classes, so that's straightforward. The sum function can be written as a separate function. Let's start with that. The sum function in Java takes an int a and returns the sum of its digits. The C version should do the same. So the signature would be int sum(int a). The code inside is a loop: while a is >=10, subtract the last digit and add to ans, then divide a by 10. Finally add the remaining a. So that part can stay the same. Next, the main function. Java uses Scanner for input. In C, we'll use scanf. So we need to have int N; and read it with scanf(\"%d\", &N);. Looking at the logic inside main. The variable n is determined based on whether N is even or odd. The code checks N%2, and sets n to N/2 or (N+1)/2.",

Wait, variables. In Java's main, the variables like A are declared inside the for loop. In C, for loops can have variables declared in the initialization part. So like for(int A=1; A<=n; A++)... but in C, the scope is different, but since it's inside the loop, that's okay. Now, possible edge cases. What about N=1? Let's see, but the loop would run up to n=1/2 (since N is odd, (1+1)/2 is 1. So yes). Wait, in the case of N odd, like N=3: then n is (3+1)/2=2. So the loop runs from 1 to 2.
