So for correctness, the code should read exactly N numbers and continue.\n\nBut in programming contests, the inputs are correct, so we can assume that.\n\nOkay. Now, putting it all into code:\n\nThe code should look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, K;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n    int *a = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, N, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {\n        sum += a[i];\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but why not use a stack array if possible? But in C, the maximum N could be large like 1e5. So using malloc is okay. The Java code uses new int[n], so similarly in C we use malloc.\n\nWait, what if N is 0 or K is 0? Probably the problem constraints prevent that, but the code would work in that case (sum would be 0).\n\nAnother consideration: Endianness or other? No, because the data as integers is stored correctly.\n\nTesting on sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n5 1 3 \u2192 after sort [1,3,5], sum first 2 is 4 \u2192 code outputs 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother Edge case: K is equal to N \u2192 sum all elements.\n\nAnother case: K=0 \u2192 sum is 0? But probably K is at least 1.\n\nBut according to the code, as per problem's constraints.\n\nSo, this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array is sorted with parallelSort. So the C code's qsort uses a compare function that's correct? Yes. The return value of compare(a,b) should be negative if a is less than b, zero if equal, positive otherwise. So the compare function as written is okay.\n\nWait, in C, when you cast the void pointers to int pointers:\n\n*(int*)a is the first element's value, *(int*)b the second. The return value is their difference. If a is less than b, the difference is negative, which is correct for ascending sort. So the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Which is correct.\n\nOkay, the code should be correct.\n\nHence this is the C translation."
