The first printed pair is the first one generated in the first iteration of the while loop. The first iteration of the while loop:\n\nThe smallest degree node (u) is popped from the heap. Then, for each neighbor v in edges[u], the code removes the edge from v's adjacency list. Then, for the first neighbor (i=0), it prints u+1 and v+1, and toggles u's parity. For other neighbors, it prints v+1 and u+1, toggling v's parity. Wait, the code in the first Python file:\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(edges[u]):\n\n    edges[v].remove(u) if parity[u] != 0 and i == 0:\n\n        print(u + 1, v + 1)\n\n        parity[u] = 1 - parity[u]\n\n    else:\n\n        print(v + 1, u + 1)\n\n        parity[v] = 1 - parity[v]\n\n    degs[v] -= 1\n\n    heapq.heappush(Q, (degs[v], v)) Wait, the loop over edges[u] is using enumerate to get the index i and the neighbor v. The first neighbor (i=0) is handled differently. So for the first neighbor, if parity[u] is not zero (i.e., parity[u] is 1?), then it prints u and v. Else, it prints v and u. Wait, the condition is \"if parity[u] ! =0 and i ==0\". So when i is 0 and parity[u] is non-zero, then print u and v. Else, print v and u.\n\nWait, parity is initialized to 0 for all nodes. So initially, parity[u] is 0. So for the first iteration, when processing the first neighbor (i=0), the condition is false (parity[u] is 0), so it goes to the else clause, printing v+1 and u+1, and toggles v's parity. Wait, let me see:\n\nInitially, parity[u] is 0. So for the first neighbor (i=0), the condition (parity[u] ! =0 and i==0) is false. So the else clause is taken: print v+1, u+1.",

But given the problem constraints, perhaps it's manageable. 2. The sieve array in the second part is declared as an array of size 1e5+1, which is 100001 elements. That's about 400KB, which is acceptable. 3. The third part's string s is assumed to be up to 6 digits (since 1e5 is 100000, which is 6 digits). The array size of 20 is sufficient. 4. The first part's code for the first_output: when M is odd, first_output is set to -1. The second part then sets X to -1, and the sieve loop starts at X = -1. The sieve array is 0 for indices 0 and 1, so the first prime found would be 2.\n\n5.",

But in Python 3.7+, sets do preserve insertion order, but that's not guaranteed. So this is a problem.",

If X is larger than the maximum prime (1e5), then the loop won't find any primes. But the problem's second Python code has a loop up to 100008, so perhaps the sieve should be up to 1e5+10 or something. Wait, the second Python code's sieve is up to 100010. So in C, the sieve should be up to 1e5+10. Wait, in the second Python code:\n\nprime = [True] * (100010) so the sieve is up to 100010. So in C, the sieve array should be up to 100010. So in the second part's code:\n\nconst int max_prime = 100010;\n\nand the sieve array should be of size max_prime +1. But in the current code, it's set to 1e5, which is 100000. So that's a bug. Need to change max_prime to 100010. Also, the sieve loop in the second part's code:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i*i <= max_prime; i++) {\n\nWait, the second Python code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 3 and increments by 2. But in the C code, the sieve is implemented as standard sieve. Wait, the second Python code's sieve:\n\nprime[0] = False\n\nprime[1] = False\n\nfor i in range(4, 100010, 2):\n\n    prime[i] = False\n\ni = 3\n\nwhile (i * i <= 100008): if prime[i]:\n\n        for j in range(i + i, 100008, i):\n\n            prime[j] = False\n\n    i += 2\n\nSo the sieve first marks even numbers (except 2) as non-prime. Then starts at i=3 and checks odd numbers. In C, the sieve can be implemented as:\n\nInitialize sieve to all true. sieve[0] = sieve[1] = false.\n\nfor (int i = 4; i <= max_prime; i += 2) sieve[i] = false;\n\nfor (int i = 3; i*i <= max_prime; i += 2) {\n\n    if (sieve[i]) {\n\n        for (int j = i*i; j <= max_prime; j += i) {\n\n            sieve[j] = false;\n\n        }\n\n    }",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each part and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Python file reads N and M, then M edges. It builds an adjacency list, checks if M is odd, and if so, outputs -1. Then it uses a heap to process nodes, printing pairs of nodes. The second file takes an integer X and finds the next prime after X. The third counts character frequencies in a string and decides who wins based on some conditions.\n\nThe challenge is to combine all three into one C program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first file's input is from stdin, the second uses the output of the first, and the third uses the output of the second. But in C, I can't have intermediate I/O. So I need to pass data between the steps in memory.\n\nWait, the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the first part's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But in C, I can't have the first part write to stdout and then the second read from stdin. So I need to process all steps in memory, passing data between them without I/O in the middle.\n\nHmm, so the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is the printed lines from the first Python code. Wait, the first Python file's main output is the pairs of nodes it prints. But the second Python file expects an integer X as input. Wait, looking at the second Python file's first line: X = int(input()). So the output of the first program must be an integer that is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program's output is multiple lines of pairs. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the first program's output is multiple lines of two numbers each. The second program expects a single integer X. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the first Python code's output: it prints pairs of nodes. The second Python code's first line is X = int(input()), so it expects a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but the first code's output is multiple lines. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misread the code.\n\nWait, let me check the first Python code again. The first code's main loop prints pairs of nodes. So its output is multiple lines. But the second code expects an integer X. That can't be. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second's input is the first's output's last line? Or maybe the first program's output is a single integer, but in the code, it's printing multiple lines. Wait, looking at the first code:\n\nThe first code has a loop that prints pairs. So the first program's output is multiple lines. The second program's input is X, which is a single integer. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is a single integer, but in the code, it's not. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the last line printed? Or maybe the first program's output is the first line? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is multiple lines. The second program expects a single integer. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, looking at the first Python code again. Let me see:\n\nThe first code starts with N, M = map(int, input().split()), so it reads N and M from input. Then it reads M edges. Then, if M is odd, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it proceeds to process edges and print pairs of nodes. So the output of the first program is either -1 (if M is odd) or a series of pairs. The second program expects an integer X as input. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but that's not the case unless the first program's output is only the -1. Wait, but when M is even, it prints multiple lines. So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the problem's setup is that the first program's output is the last line printed? Or maybe the first program's output is the first line? Or maybe the first program's output is the number of edges or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the last printed number, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line, but that's not the case. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to re-examine the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the list of edges printed, but the second program is expecting an integer. That can't be. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second's input is the first's output's first line? Or maybe the first program's output is a single integer, but in the code, it's not. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the number of edges or something else. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the last printed line? For example, when M is even, it prints multiple lines, but the second program takes the last line as X? Or maybe the first program's output is the first line? Or perhaps the first program's output is the count of something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number of edges, but that's M. But the second program's input is X, which is an integer. So perhaps the first program's output is the number of edges, but that's M. But the first program's output is not M, but pairs of nodes. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line, which is the first pair, but that's not an integer. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look at the code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nAfter processing edges, it uses a heap to process nodes, and for each step, it prints a pair of nodes. So the output is multiple lines of two integers each. The second program expects an integer X. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but that's not the case. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is the first line, but that's two numbers. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the number of edges, but that's M. But the first program's output is not M. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the last printed line? For example, when M is even, the first program prints several lines, and the second program takes the last line as X. But the second program expects an integer, but the line has two numbers. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first number of the first line? Or perhaps the first program's output is the count of edges, but that's M. But the first program's output is not M. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first number of the first line printed. But that's not an integer. Wait, the first line printed is two numbers. So that's not an integer. So this is a problem. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is not the printed lines, but some other value? Or perhaps the second program's input is not the first's output, but the first's output is the input to the second's input? Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first program's output. But the first program's output is multiple lines of two numbers. The second program expects a single integer. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer, but in the code, it's not. So maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number? Or perhaps the first program's output is the first line's second number? Or maybe the first program's output is the number of edges, but that's M. But the first program's output is not M. So I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number. For example, if the first line is \"a b\", then the second program's X is a. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the number of edges printed, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first number of the first line, but that's not an integer. Wait, the first line is two integers, so the first number is an integer. So perhaps the second program takes that as X. But that's a guess. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program uses that as X. But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's second number. But without knowing the problem's actual input/output flow, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program uses that as X. Let me proceed with that assumption, but I need to check the code again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program uses that as X. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is a series of lines, each with two numbers. The second program's input is the first number of the first line. Then the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is the next prime after X. But the third program's input is a string, not an integer. Wait, the third program's first line is s = list(input()), so it reads a string. So the second program's output must be a string, which is the input to the third. The second program's output is the next prime after X, which is an integer. So the third program's input is that integer as a string? Or perhaps the second program's output is the prime number, which is an integer, and the third program reads that as a string. But that would be a single character if it's a single digit, but maybe it's treated as a string of digits. Hmm, but the third program's input is a string, so the second program's output must be a string. So the second program's output is the prime number as a string, which the third program reads as the input string. But that would make the third program process the digits of the prime number as characters. That might be possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, the second program takes that as X, outputs the next prime, which is an integer, and the third program takes that integer as a string (e.g., \"12345\" if the prime is 12345). But that's a possible scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number, the second program's output is the next prime, which is an integer, and the third program's input is that integer as a string. But the third program's input is a string, so the second program's output must be printed as a string. So the third program would read that as a string of digits. For example, if the second program outputs 101, the third program's input is \"101\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, the second program's output is the next prime, which is an integer, and the third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program's input is the string representation of that prime.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Since the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next, I have to assume that the first program's output is the input to the second, which is a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But according to the first Python code, when M is even, it prints multiple lines. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, but that's not an integer. Wait, the first line is two integers, so the first number is an integer. So perhaps the second program takes that as X. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program uses that as X. Then the second program's output is the next prime after X, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program would process the digits of that prime number. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, but the second program's input is the entire output of the first program. But the second program expects an integer, so that can't be. So I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. Let me proceed with that, even if it's a guess. Because otherwise, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. Let me try to see how the code would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. Let me proceed with that.\n\nNow, the problem is to translate all three into a single C program. The first part must read input, process it, and pass data to the second part, which processes it and passes to the third, which outputs the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and M, edges, process as per first Python code. The output of this step is the first line's first number (assuming that's the input to the second step). But how?\n\nWait, the first Python code's output is multiple lines. The second program's input is X, which is an integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number. Let me assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program takes that as X. Then the second program's output is the next prime after X, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program would process the digits of that prime number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. The second program's output is the next prime, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program's input is the string representation of that prime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. The second program's output is the next prime, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program's input is the string of digits of that prime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. The second program's output is the next prime, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer as a string. So the third program's input is the string of digits of that prime.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the first program's output is a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number. Let me proceed with that.\n\nNow, the first Python code's first line of output is the first pair of nodes. So the first number is the first element of that pair. Let's say that's the input to the second program.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first line's second number. But I need to make a decision here. Since the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next, and the second program expects an integer, the first program's output must be a single integer. So the first program's output is the first line's first number. Let me proceed with that.\n\nNow, the first part in C must read N and M, process edges, and then output the first number of the first printed pair. But in the first Python code, the first printed pair is the first one generated in the loop. So in C, I need to capture that first number and pass it to the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, so the first part of the C program must capture that value and pass it to the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, so the first part of the C program must process the edges and then return that first number as the output to the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, so the first part of the C program must process the edges and then store that first number in a variable to pass to the second part.\n\nThe second part of the C program takes that number as X, finds the next prime, and outputs that prime. The third part takes that prime as a string (as a character array) and processes it.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string, so the second part's output must be a string. So the second part's output is the prime number as a string, which is passed to the third part.\n\nAlternatively, the second part's output is the prime number as an integer, and the third part must read it as a string. So in C, the second part can store the prime as an integer, then convert it to a string to pass to the third part.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but I need to proceed.\n\nLet me outline the steps in C:\n\n1. Read N and M from stdin.\n\n2. Read M edges, build adjacency lists.\n\n3. Check if M is odd. If so, output -1 (but then the second program would take that as X, but the second program would process it. Wait, but the first program's output is the first line's first number. If M is odd, the first program prints -1 and exits. So in that case, the first program's output is -1, which is the input to the second program. The second program would then take X = -1, but primes are positive integers. So the second program would output the next prime after -1, which is 2. Then the third program would process \"2\".\n\nBut I need to handle all cases.\n\nSo in the first part of the C program:\n\n- Read N and M.\n\n- Read M edges, build adjacency lists.\n\n- If M is odd, then the first program's output is -1. So the first part's output is -1, which is passed to the second part.\n\n- Else, process the edges as per the first Python code, and capture the first printed pair's first number. That is the first number in the first printed line.\n\nWait, the first Python code's loop prints pairs. The first printed pair is the first one generated in the loop. So in C, I need to track the first printed pair's first element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first printed pair is the first one generated in the while loop. Let me see the first Python code's loop:\n\nThe first Python code uses a heap Q. The loop pops the smallest degree node (since the heap is based on degree). Then for each neighbor, it prints a pair. The first printed pair would be the first pair generated in the first iteration of the while loop.\n\nSo in C, I need to track the first printed pair's first element. Let me think of how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first printed pair is the first one generated in the first iteration of the while loop. So in C, during processing, when the first print statement is executed, we can capture that first number and store it as the output for the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first printed number of the first line. So in C, during the first print, we can capture that value and store it as the output to the second part.\n\nBut in C, since we can't have actual print statements except in the first and last parts, we need to process everything in memory.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say:\n\n- Only the first block should handle reading input.\n\n- Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n- Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\n- Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\n\nSo the entire C program must read input once at the beginning, process all steps in memory, and output the final result at the end.\n\nTherefore, the first part's output (the first program's output) must be stored in a variable, passed to the second part, which processes it and produces its output (the second program's output), which is then passed to the third part, which produces the final output.\n\nTherefore, the first part's output is the first program's output (the first line's first number, or whatever it is), stored in a variable. The second part takes that variable as input, processes it, and stores its output (the next prime) in another variable. The third part takes that variable and processes it, then outputs the final result.\n\nSo the key is to model the data flow between the three steps in memory.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (equivalent to first Python file):\n\nRead N and M, edges. Then process as per the first Python code, and capture the first printed number (the first element of the first printed pair) as the output for the second part. If M is odd, output is -1.\n\nWait, but when M is odd, the first program prints -1 and exits. So in that case, the first part's output is -1, which is passed to the second part. The second part would then take X = -1, but the second program's code would process it. Let's see the second Python code:\n\nSecond Python code:\n\nX = int(input())\n\nThen it initializes a sieve for primes up to 1e5, then loops from X upwards to find the next prime.\n\nIf X is -1, then the loop starts at X = -1, but the sieve is up to 1e5. The first prime after -1 is 2, so the second program would output 2. Then the third program would process \"2\".\n\nSo in the first part, when M is odd, the first part's output is -1, which is passed to the second part, which outputs 2, then the third part processes \"2\".\n\nNow, the first part's processing:\n\nThe first part must process the edges and determine the first printed pair's first number. Let's see how the first Python code works.\n\nThe first code uses a priority queue (heap) based on degrees. The nodes with the smallest degree are processed first. For each node u, it iterates over its edges, and for each neighbor v, it removes the edge from v's adjacency list, then decides which order to print the pair (u, v) or (v, u) based on the parity of u's parity.\n\nThe first printed pair is the first one generated in the first iteration of the while loop.\n\nThe first iteration of the while loop:\n\nThe smallest degree node (u) is popped from the heap. Then, for each neighbor v in edges[u], the code removes the edge from v's adjacency list. Then, for the first neighbor (i=0), it prints u+1 and v+1, and toggles u's parity. For other neighbors, it prints v+1 and u+1, toggling v's parity.\n\nWait, the code in the first Python file:\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(edges[u]):\n\n    edges[v].remove(u)\n\n    if parity[u] != 0 and i == 0:\n\n        print(u + 1, v + 1)\n\n        parity[u] = 1 - parity[u]\n\n    else:\n\n        print(v + 1, u + 1)\n\n        parity[v] = 1 - parity[v]\n\n    degs[v] -= 1\n\n    heapq.heappush(Q, (degs[v], v))\n\nWait, the loop over edges[u] is using enumerate to get the index i and the neighbor v. The first neighbor (i=0) is handled differently.\n\nSo for the first neighbor, if parity[u] is not zero (i.e., parity[u] is 1?), then it prints u and v. Else, it prints v and u. Wait, the condition is \"if parity[u] !=0 and i ==0\". So when i is 0 and parity[u] is non-zero, then print u and v. Else, print v and u.\n\nWait, parity is initialized to 0 for all nodes. So initially, parity[u] is 0. So for the first iteration, when processing the first neighbor (i=0), the condition is false (parity[u] is 0), so it goes to the else clause, printing v+1 and u+1, and toggles v's parity.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nInitially, parity[u] is 0. So for the first neighbor (i=0), the condition (parity[u] !=0 and i==0) is false. So the else clause is taken: print v+1, u+1. Then, parity[v] is toggled (to 1).\n\nSo the first printed pair is (v+1, u+1). So the first number is v+1, the second is u+1.\n\nTherefore, the first printed pair's first number is v+1, where v is the first neighbor of the first node u processed.\n\nSo in the first part of the C program, I need to track the first printed pair's first number, which is v+1 (the first neighbor's index plus 1).\n\nTherefore, in the C code, during processing, when the first print is about to happen, we can capture that value and store it as the output for the second part.\n\nBut how to do this in C without actually printing?\n\nWe can simulate the first program's processing, and track the first printed pair's first number.\n\nSo the steps for the first part in C:\n\n- Read N and M.\n\n- Read M edges, build adjacency lists (as arrays of linked lists or arrays).\n\n- Check if M is odd. If yes, set the first output to -1 and proceed to the second part.\n\n- Else, process the edges as per the first Python code's algorithm, but instead of printing, track the first printed pair's first number.\n\nWait, but the algorithm is complex. Let's think of how to implement it in C.\n\nFirst, the adjacency lists can be represented as arrays of linked lists or arrays. Since in Python, edges are stored as sets, which are unordered. But in C, perhaps using arrays of linked lists, but for efficiency, maybe arrays of arrays (but dynamic size).\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, each edge is stored in both nodes' adjacency lists.\n\nThe first part's processing steps:\n\nInitialize adjacency lists, degrees, parity, flag arrays.\n\nThen, create a priority queue (min-heap) based on degree.\n\nThe heap in C can be implemented using an array and heapify functions.\n\nThe main loop:\n\nWhile the heap is not empty:\n\n    Extract the node u with the smallest degree.\n\n    If flag[u] is true, skip.\n\n    Mark flag[u] as true.\n\n    Iterate over all neighbors v in edges[u].\n\n    For each v:\n\n        Remove u from edges[v]'s list.\n\n        Decrement the degree of v.\n\n        Then, decide whether to print (u, v) or (v, u) based on parity.\n\n        But in C, instead of printing, we need to track the first such pair's first element.\n\n    Push the updated degree of v into the heap.\n\nBut to track the first printed pair's first element, we can have a flag indicating whether we've found it yet. Once we find the first pair, we can store its first element and break out of processing once we have it, but that might not be possible because the algorithm requires processing all steps. Alternatively, we have to process the entire algorithm but track the first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the algorithm normally, but whenever a pair is \"printed\", we check if it's the first one and record its first element.\n\nSo in C:\n\nWe can have a variable first_output initialized to 0 or some invalid value. Once the first pair is processed (the first time we would have printed), we set first_output to the first element of that pair and continue processing the rest of the algorithm (since we need to process all steps to get the correct second part's input, but actually, the second part's input is only the first element of the first pair, so maybe we can stop processing after that? No, because the algorithm's processing affects the rest of the steps, but the first part's output is only the first pair's first element. So we have to process the entire algorithm but track the first pair's first element.\n\nHmm, but the first pair's first element is determined early in the processing. So perhaps we can process the algorithm normally, but whenever the first pair is generated, we record its first element and continue processing the rest of the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, in C code:\n\nInitialize first_output to 0.\n\nThen, during the processing of the first part's algorithm:\n\nWhenever a pair is to be printed (i.e., when the code would have printed in Python), check if first_output is still 0. If yes, set first_output to the first element of the pair, then continue processing.\n\nOnce first_output is set, we can continue processing the rest of the algorithm, but we don't need to track further pairs.\n\nSo the first part's output is first_output.\n\nNow, the second part takes this first_output as X, and finds the next prime after X.\n\nThe second part's code in Python is straightforward: it uses sieve of Eratosthenes up to 1e5, then loops from X upwards to find the first prime.\n\nIn C, we can implement the sieve, then loop from X upwards until we find a prime.\n\nThe third part takes the prime number found by the second part and processes it as a string. The third program's code counts the frequency of each character in the string, and determines the winner based on whether there's at most one character with an odd count.\n\nWait, the third program's input is a string, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is the next prime after X, which is an integer. So the third program's input is the string representation of that integer.\n\nTherefore, the second part's output is the prime number as an integer, which must be converted to a string to be passed to the third part.\n\nWait, but in C, the third part needs to process the string. So the second part's output is the prime number, which is stored as an integer, then converted to a string (array of characters) to be passed to the third part.\n\nSo the third part's input is a string (char array) representing the prime number.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nFirst part:\n\n- Process edges, get first_output (first pair's first element).\n\nSecond part:\n\n- Take first_output as X.\n\n- Find the next prime after X, store as prime_output (integer).\n\nThird part:\n\n- Convert prime_output to a string (char array).\n\n- Process the string to determine the output.\n\nNow, putting this all together in C.\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nWe need to read N and M, then M edges. Then process as per the first Python code.\n\nImplementing the first part in C:\n\nWe can represent the adjacency lists as arrays of linked lists. But for simplicity, perhaps using arrays of arrays. Since in Python, edges are stored as sets, which are unordered. But in C, perhaps using arrays of linked lists.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, for each node, we can have an array of its neighbors. Since the edges are added in both directions, we can manage that.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps using an array of linked lists.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum N is not specified, but in the first Python code, it's using N nodes. Let's assume N is up to say 1e5, but perhaps the problem constraints are smaller. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the first Python code uses sets for edges, perhaps in C, for each node, we can have an array of integers for its neighbors, and track the size.\n\nBut for the first part's processing, the exact order of neighbors might matter because the first neighbor is chosen based on the order in the edges list. Wait, in Python, the edges are stored as a set, so the order is not preserved. So in C, the order of neighbors in the adjacency list may affect the first printed pair. Therefore, to replicate the Python code's behavior, the order of neighbors must be the same as in the Python code.\n\nBut in Python, when iterating over a set, the order is arbitrary. So the first neighbor could be any of the neighbors. Therefore, the first printed pair's first element depends on the order in which the set is iterated, which is not deterministic. This is a problem because the C code must produce the same output as the Python code, but the Python code's first printed pair's first element is not deterministic due to the set's iteration order.\n\nWait, this is a critical issue. The first Python code's first printed pair's first element depends on the order in which the edges are stored in the set. Since sets in Python are unordered, the first neighbor could be any of the neighbors of u. Therefore, the first printed pair's first element is not deterministic, which means the C code's output could vary depending on how the adjacency lists are stored, leading to different results.\n\nThis is a problem because the user requires the C program to behave identically to the original chain. Therefore, the first Python code's output is not deterministic, which makes it impossible to replicate exactly in C unless we can replicate the same iteration order of the edges.\n\nHmm, this is a big problem. The first Python code's first printed pair's first element is not deterministic because the edges are stored in a set, which has an arbitrary order. Therefore, the first part's output (the first element of the first pair) is not deterministic, so the second part's input is not deterministic, leading to different results.\n\nThis means that the problem as stated may have an issue, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the first Python code's first printed pair is the first neighbor in the adjacency list's iteration order. To replicate this in C, we need to ensure that the adjacency lists are stored in the same order as the Python code's sets. But since sets in Python are unordered, this is not possible unless we can control the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first Python code's first neighbor is the first one added to the set. But in Python, when you add elements to a set, the order is not preserved. So the iteration order of a set is not predictable.\n\nThis means that the first Python code's output is not deterministic, so the C code cannot replicate it exactly unless we can enforce a specific order.\n\nThis is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the first Python code's first printed pair's first element is not important, and the first part's output is not the first element but something else. Or perhaps I misunderstood the first program's output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, but since the order is arbitrary, the problem expects us to ignore this and proceed with whatever the code produces. But the user requires the C program to behave identically, so this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not the first line's first number but the entire output, but the second program's input is a single integer. This suggests that perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, but the code's first line's first number is the first element of the first pair, which is non-deterministic. Therefore, the problem may have an error, but I have to proceed.\n\nPerhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, and the second program's input is that. But since the first program's output is non-deterministic, the C code must replicate the same order as the Python code's iteration of the edges.\n\nTo do that, perhaps in C, the adjacency lists should be stored in the order the edges were added. Since in Python, when you add to a set, the insertion order is not preserved, but in C, if we use a linked list and add edges in the order they are read, then the iteration order would be the insertion order, which would match the Python code's behavior if the Python code's set's iteration order is insertion order. But in Python 3.7+, sets do preserve insertion order, but that's not guaranteed. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first line's first number, but the code's first printed pair is the first edge in the adjacency list of the first node processed. To replicate this, in C, the adjacency lists must be stored in the order the edges were added. So when building the adjacency lists, for each edge a-b, we add b to a's list and a to b's list. The order in which edges are added would affect the adjacency list's order.\n\nTherefore, in C, to replicate the Python code's behavior, the adjacency lists must be built in the order the edges are read, and when iterating over the edges, the order is the same as the insertion order.\n\nTherefore, in C, for each node's adjacency list, we can store the neighbors in the order they were added. So when building the adjacency lists, for each edge a and b (read from input), we add b to a's list and a to b's list. The order of the edges in the adjacency lists will be the order in which the edges were added.\n\nThis way, when iterating over edges[u], the first neighbor is the first one added to the list, which would match the Python code's behavior if the Python code's set's iteration order is insertion order (which it is in Python 3.7+).\n\nAssuming that the Python code's set's iteration order is insertion order, then this approach would work.\n\nTherefore, in C:\n\n- For each node, maintain an array of neighbors, and add them in the order they are read.\n\n- When iterating over edges[u], the order is the insertion order.\n\nThis way, the first neighbor of u is the first one added to the list.\n\nTherefore, the first printed pair's first element can be determined.\n\nNow, proceeding to code.\n\nFirst part's code outline:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize adjacency lists as arrays of linked lists or dynamic arrays.\n\nRead M edges:\n\nfor each edge a, b:\n\n    a and b are 1-based in input, so convert to 0-based.\n\n    add b to edges[a-1]\n\n    add a to edges[b-1]\n\n    increment degrees for both a-1 and b-1.\n\nCheck if M is odd:\n\n    if yes, first_output = -1.\n\nElse:\n\n    proceed to process the edges.\n\nInitialize the heap. The heap elements are (degree, node). We can use a priority queue based on degree.\n\nImplement the heap in C using an array and functions to heapify, push, pop.\n\nThe heap structure can be an array of structs containing degree and node.\n\nWe need to implement the heap operations.\n\nThen, process the nodes as per the algorithm.\n\nTrack the first printed pair's first element.\n\nNow, the algorithm steps:\n\nInitialize flag array (all false), parity array (all 0).\n\nInitialize the heap with all nodes' degrees.\n\nHeapify the heap.\n\nThen, while the heap is not empty:\n\n    extract the node u with smallest degree.\n\n    if flag[u] is true, continue.\n\n    mark flag[u] as true.\n\n    iterate over all neighbors v in edges[u]:\n\n        remove u from edges[v]'s list. (This is tricky in C, since we need to remove an element from an array. Alternatively, since we are processing edges, perhaps we can just decrement the degree and not modify the adjacency lists, but that might not be necessary.)\n\nWait, in the first Python code, after removing the edge from v's adjacency list, but in C, since we are not actually printing, but just tracking the first pair, perhaps we can skip modifying the adjacency lists, but track the degrees.\n\nWait, the first Python code's code:\n\nedges[v].remove(u)\n\nThis is because the edge between u and v is being processed, so it's removed from v's adjacency list. But in the algorithm, this is done to prevent revisiting the edge.\n\nHowever, in C, since we are not actually processing the edges but just tracking the first pair, perhaps we can ignore this step, but that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, we need to track the degrees and adjacency lists properly.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Let me think of a way to represent the adjacency lists and degrees.\n\nPerhaps the adjacency lists can be represented as arrays of integers, with a size for each.\n\nFor example:\n\nstruct EdgeList {\n    int *neighbors;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n};\n\nWe can dynamically allocate arrays for each node's neighbors.\n\nWhen adding a neighbor, we can append to the array.\n\nWhen iterating over edges[u], we can loop through the neighbors array.\n\nBut when we need to remove u from edges[v]'s list, we have to find u in v's neighbors array and remove it. This is O(n) time for each removal, which could be slow for large N, but perhaps manageable for the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the first Python code's algorithm requires that after processing an edge between u and v, the edge is removed from both adjacency lists, we need to do that in C as well.\n\nThis is going to be complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the code outline for the first part:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize EdgeList arrays for each node.\n\nRead M edges, and for each a and b (converted to 0-based):\n\n    add b to edges[a]'s list.\n\n    add a to edges[b]'s list.\n\n    increment degrees[a] and degrees[b].\n\nCheck if M is odd:\n\n    if yes, first_output = -1.\n\nElse:\n\n    proceed.\n\nInitialize the heap.\n\nThe heap is an array of structs:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int degree;\n    int node;\n} HeapElement;\n\nHeapElement heap[...];\n\nBut in C, dynamic arrays are needed. Alternatively, since the maximum N is up to say 1e5, but perhaps the problem's constraints are smaller. Let's assume N is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array for the heap.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume N is small enough for a static array.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array approach with realloc.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Perhaps I can proceed with a simplified approach, assuming that the adjacency lists are stored in arrays, and when we need to remove an element, we can do it by shifting elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first Python code's algorithm doesn't require the adjacency lists to be modified, but the degrees are tracked.\n\nWait, looking at the first Python code:\n\nedges[v].remove(u)\n\nThis is done to remove the edge between u and v from v's adjacency list. But in the algorithm, after processing this edge, the edge is no longer considered. So the degree of v is decremented, and the edge is removed from the adjacency list.\n\nIn C, to do this, when processing a neighbor v of u:\n\n- We need to find u in v's adjacency list and remove it.\n\nThis requires searching the array for u and then shifting elements.\n\nThis is O(k) time for each edge, where k is the number of neighbors of v.\n\nThis could be time-consuming for large N and M, but perhaps manageable for the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first Python code's algorithm can be rephrased without modifying the adjacency lists, but using the degrees and flags to track processed edges.\n\nWait, the algorithm's purpose is to find an Eulerian trail or something similar, but I'm not sure. The code's logic is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not the first pair's first element but the first printed number, but the code's first printed pair is the first edge processed in the algorithm, and the first element is the first neighbor of the first node processed.\n\nAssuming that the first node processed is the one with the smallest degree, and the first neighbor is the first in the adjacency list's order (which is insertion order), then the first printed pair's first element can be tracked.\n\nNow, proceeding to code.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Define maximum possible N. Let's assume N is up to 1e5, but adjust as needed.\n#define MAX_N 100000\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *neighbors;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} EdgeList;\n\nEdgeList edges[MAX_N];\n\nint degrees[MAX_N];\nint flag[MAX_N];\nint parity[MAX_N];\n\n// Heap implementation\ntypedef struct {\n    int degree;\n    int node;\n} HeapElement;\n\nHeapElement heap[MAX_N];\nint heap_size;\n\nvoid swap(HeapElement *a, HeapElement *b) {\n    HeapElement temp = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = temp;\n}\n\nvoid heapify_up(int idx) {\n    while (idx > 0) {\n        int parent = (idx - 1) / 2;\n        if (heap[parent].degree <= heap[idx].degree) break;\n        swap(&heap[parent], &heap[idx]);\n        idx = parent;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid heapify_down(int idx) {\n    int smallest = idx;\n    int left = 2 * idx + 1;\n    int right = 2 * idx + 2;\n    if (left < heap_size && heap[left].degree < heap[smallest].degree)\n        smallest = left;\n    if (right < heap_size && heap[right].degree < heap[smallest].degree)\n        smallest = right;\n    if (smallest != idx) {\n        swap(&heap[smallest], &heap[idx]);\n        heapify_down(smallest);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid heap_push(HeapElement elem) {\n    heap[heap_size] = elem;\n    heapify_up(heap_size++);\n}\n\nHeapElement heap_pop() {\n    HeapElement root = heap[0];\n    heap[0] = heap[--heap_size];\n    heapify_down(0);\n    return root;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    // Initialize EdgeLists\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        edges[i].neighbors = NULL;\n        edges[i].size = 0;\n        edges[i].capacity = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        degrees[i] = 0;\n        flag[i] = 0;\n        parity[i] = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        a--; b--;\n        // Add to edges[a]\n        if (edges[a].size == edges[a].capacity) {\n            edges[a].capacity = edges[a].capacity ?

The first part's code for removing u from edges[v]'s list is O(n^2) time, which could be slow for large N and M. But given the problem constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\n2. The sieve array in the second part is declared as an array of size 1e5+1, which is 100001 elements. That's about 400KB, which is acceptable.\n\n3. The third part's string s is assumed to be up to 6 digits (since 1e5 is 100000, which is 6 digits). The array size of 20 is sufficient.\n\n4. The first part's code for the first_output: when M is odd, first_output is set to -1. The second part then sets X to -1, and the sieve loop starts at X = -1. The sieve array is 0 for indices 0 and 1, so the first prime found would be 2.\n\n5. The third part's code counts the frequency of each character in the string s (the prime number as a string), and determines the output based on the count of characters with odd frequencies.\n\nThis should replicate the behavior of the three Python files in sequence.\n\nHowever, there are potential issues:\n\n- The first part's code for removing u from edges[v]'s list may have bugs. For example, when iterating over edges[u], the code removes u from edges[v], but this is done for each neighbor v of u. However, the code may have a loop over edges[u].neighbors, and for each v in that list, it removes u from edges[v].neighbors. This is correct.\n\n- The first part's code for the first_output: the code checks if found_first is 0 before setting first_output. The first time a pair is processed (either the first neighbor or any other), it will set first_output to the first element of the pair. This should capture the first printed pair's first element.\n\n- The second part's sieve loop starts at X. If X is larger than the maximum prime (1e5), then the loop won't find any primes. But the problem's second Python code has a loop up to 100008, so perhaps the sieve should be up to 1e5+10 or something. Wait, the second Python code's sieve is up to 100010. So in C, the sieve should be up to 1e5+10.\n\nWait, in the second Python code:\n\nprime = [True] * (100010)\n\nso the sieve is up to 100010. So in C, the sieve array should be up to 100010.\n\nSo in the second part's code:\n\nconst int max_prime = 100010;\n\nand the sieve array should be of size max_prime +1.\n\nBut in the current code, it's set to 1e5, which is 100000. So that's a bug. Need to change max_prime to 100010.\n\nAlso, the sieve loop in the second part's code:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i*i <= max_prime; i++) {\n\nWait, the second Python code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 3 and increments by 2. But in the C code, the sieve is implemented as standard sieve.\n\nWait, the second Python code's sieve:\n\nprime[0] = False\n\nprime[1] = False\n\nfor i in range(4, 100010, 2):\n\n    prime[i] = False\n\ni = 3\n\nwhile (i * i <= 100008):\n\n    if prime[i]:\n\n        for j in range(i + i, 100008, i):\n\n            prime[j] = False\n\n    i += 2\n\nSo the sieve first marks even numbers (except 2) as non-prime. Then starts at i=3 and checks odd numbers.\n\nIn C, the sieve can be implemented as:\n\nInitialize sieve to all true.\n\nsieve[0] = sieve[1] = false.\n\nfor (int i = 4; i <= max_prime; i += 2) sieve[i] = false;\n\nfor (int i = 3; i*i <= max_prime; i += 2) {\n\n    if (sieve[i]) {\n\n        for (int j = i*i; j <= max_prime; j += i) {\n\n            sieve[j] = false;\n\n        }\n\n    }"
