Let's try this approach. Each node's edges can be stored as an array of integers, with a current size and capacity. For example:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *list;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} EdgeList;\n\nEdgeList *edges = malloc(N * sizeof(EdgeList));\n\nfor (i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    edges[i].list = malloc(16 * sizeof(int)); // initial capacity\n    edges[i].size = 0;\n    edges[i].capacity = 16;\n} Then, when adding a neighbor:\n\nvoid add_edge(EdgeList *edges, int a, int b) {\n    if (edges[a].size >= edges[a].capacity) {\n        edges[a].capacity *= 2;\n        edges[a].list = realloc(edges[a].list, edges[a].capacity * sizeof(int));\n    }\n    edges[a].list[edges[a].size++] = b;\n}\n\nSimilarly for adding b to a's list and vice versa. This way, each edge is added to both nodes' adjacency lists. Once the edges are built, the code checks if M is odd. If so, output -1 and exit. Then, the heap is initialized with (degree, node) pairs. The heap is a min-heap based on degree, then node index. In C, we can implement a heap using an array. The heap elements are pairs (degree, node). We need to manage the heap structure. The heap can be an array of structs:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int degree;\n    int node;\n} HeapElement;\n\nHeapElement * heap = malloc(M * sizeof(HeapElement)); // assuming M is the max possible size\nint heap_size = 0; The heap functions (heapify, push, pop) need to be implemented.",

The parity is used to decide the order of printing for the first edge of the current node. The parity starts at 0 for all nodes. So for the first edge of a node u (i=0), if parity[u] is 0, then the else clause is taken, so the edge is printed as v u, and parity[v] is toggled.",

But the first's output is numbers, which the second can't process as 'g's and 'p's. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's code, but I have to proceed as per the given code.",

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I need to look at each part's input and output. Let me re-express each Python file's input and output:\n\nFile1: Input: First line has N and M. Then M lines each with a and b (edges). Output: A series of lines, each with two numbers (the pairs printed in the loop). The number of lines is equal to the number of edges? Or maybe not, since each edge is processed once? Not sure, but the output is lines of two numbers. File2: Input: A string (the input is read as a single line, perhaps). The string consists of 'g's and 'p's. Output: An integer (the score). File3: Input: A string (the input is read as a single line). The string has letters and punctuation.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Python file is handling some graph operations. It reads N and M, then M edges. Then it does some processing with heaps and parity flags, printing pairs of nodes. The second file processes a string to calculate a score based on 'g' and 'p' characters. The third file processes another string to format punctuation.\n\nThe key is to chain them so that the output of the first is input to the second, and the second's output to the third. But in C, I can't have intermediate I/O. So I need to structure the C program so that the first part's output is passed as input to the second part's processing, and so on, all within the same program.\n\nWait, but the problem says the first block reads input, the last produces output, and intermediates don't do I/O. So the first part (file1) will read from stdin, process, then pass data to the second part (file2) which processes without I/O, then to the third (file3) which also doesn't do I/O except the final output.\n\nHmm, but how do the outputs of each step get passed? Since in the original setup, each Python program's output is the next's input. So in C, the first part's output (the printed lines from file1) must be captured and used as input for the second part. But the second part in Python reads from input, which would be the first's output. Similarly, the second's output is the third's input.\n\nSo in C, I need to have the first part's processing generate the data that would have been printed, then pass that data to the second part's processing as input, and so on. The final output is the third part's result.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first part (file1's input: N, M, edges, then the string for file2, then the string for file3? Wait, no. Wait, the original setup is that each Python program is run in sequence, with each taking the previous's output as input. So the first Python program's input is the user's input, then its output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final result.\n\nWait, but looking at the Python code:\n\nFile1's input is N and M followed by M edges. Then it prints some pairs. Then File2 takes that output as its input (since it's the next program in the sequence). Wait, but File2's code starts with s = list(input()), so it's expecting a string. But the first program's output is a series of pairs of numbers. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the user is supposed to run the three Python files in sequence, where each program's output is the next's input. So the first program's input is the user's input, which is for N, M, edges. The first program's output is the printed lines (the pairs of numbers). Then the second program takes that output as its input. But the second program expects a string (since it's reading input as a string). Wait, that's a problem. Because the first program's output is lines of numbers, which when piped into the second program would be treated as a string. But the second program is processing a string of 'g' and 'p' characters. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the three Python files are supposed to be run in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. The third's output is the final result.\n\nBut looking at the code:\n\nFile1's output is pairs of numbers (the print statements in the loop). So the second program's input would be those numbers as a string. But the second program is expecting a string of 'g' and 'p's. That doesn't align. So maybe there's a mistake here, but perhaps the problem is correct and I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are separate, but the user is supposed to chain them, so the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which is expecting a string (the s variable in file2). So the first program's output must be a string of 'g's and 'p's? But the first program's output is numbers. That's conflicting. Hmm, maybe I need to check the code again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Python file's code:\n\nThe first file's print statements are printing pairs of numbers (u+1 and v+1). So the output is lines like \"1 2\", etc. The second Python file's input is a string (s = list(input())). So the second program is expecting a single string, perhaps from the first's output. But the first's output is multiple lines of numbers. That would be a problem. Unless the second program is reading all the input as a single string, but that would be a mess. Maybe the problem's setup is that each program is run in sequence, but the first's output is not the second's input. Maybe the three files are separate, but the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So perhaps the first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the code's variables don't align. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are part of a pipeline where each subsequent program uses the previous's output. So the first program's output is the second's input, which is a string of numbers, but the second program is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. That can't be. So perhaps the problem's code is incorrect, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three files are separate, but the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So the first program's output must be the input to the second, which is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. So the first program's output must be such a string. But the first program's code is printing pairs of numbers. That's conflicting. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is a different part. Let me re-examine the code:\n\nLooking at the three files:\n\nFile1: Reads N, M, edges, then processes and prints pairs of numbers. Its output is the pairs.\n\nFile2: Reads a string (input()), processes it, and outputs a score.\n\nFile3: Reads a string (input()), processes it, and outputs a formatted string.\n\nSo the first program's output is the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first's output is numbers. So that can't be. Unless the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's. But according to the code, the first program's output is numbers. So perhaps the problem's setup is wrong, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three files are not connected in that way. Maybe the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the second's input is a string, so the first's output must be a string. But the first's output is numbers. So perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but according to the code, it's numbers. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So I must assume that the three files are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input. So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. The third's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output must be a string that the second can process. But according to the first program's code, it's printing pairs of numbers. So the second program would read that as a string, but it's expecting 'g' and 'p's. That's a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's code, but perhaps I should proceed as per the given code, assuming that the first program's output is the second's input, even if it's numbers. The second program would then process those numbers as a string, but that would be incorrect. But perhaps the problem is correct, and I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three files are separate, and the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So I have to proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the first input (for the first Python file), process it, generate the first output (the pairs of numbers), then pass that as input to the second part (file2's processing), which would process that string of numbers as its input, then the second's output is passed to the third part (file3's processing), and finally the third's output is printed.\n\nBut how to do this in C without I/O in the middle?\n\nThe C program must:\n\n- Read the first input (for the first part), process it, store the first output (the pairs) in a buffer.\n\n- Then, take that buffer as input for the second part's processing, which would process it as a string (the s variable in file2), compute the score, then store that as the second output (the score as a string? Or as an integer? The second program's output is the score, which is an integer, so the second's output is a number, which is then the input to the third part. But the third part expects a string (input()), so the second's output must be a string that the third can process. But the third's code is processing a string with punctuation, so the second's output must be a string. But the second's output is a number. So this is conflicting again.\n\nHmm, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I need to look at each part's input and output.\n\nLet me re-express each Python file's input and output:\n\nFile1:\n\nInput: First line has N and M. Then M lines each with a and b (edges).\n\nOutput: A series of lines, each with two numbers (the pairs printed in the loop). The number of lines is equal to the number of edges? Or maybe not, since each edge is processed once? Not sure, but the output is lines of two numbers.\n\nFile2:\n\nInput: A string (the input is read as a single line, perhaps). The string consists of 'g's and 'p's.\n\nOutput: An integer (the score).\n\nFile3:\n\nInput: A string (the input is read as a single line). The string has letters and punctuation.\n\nOutput: A formatted string (with punctuation handled).\n\nSo the first program's output is a series of number pairs. The second program expects a string of 'g's and 'p's. So the first's output can't be the second's input. Therefore, perhaps the three files are not connected in that way. Maybe the problem's description is incorrect, but the user wants to translate each Python file into C code, but in a single C program that does all three steps in sequence, with the first part's input being read, then the second part's processing using the first's output, then the third part's processing using the second's output, and finally output the third's result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are separate, but the user wants to chain them into a single C program, so that the first part's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But given the data types, this is impossible unless there's a mistake in the problem's code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three files are separate, and the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So perhaps the three files are to be run in sequence, but each takes their own input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the first's output is numbers, which the second can't process as 'g's and 'p's. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's code, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are part of a pipeline where each subsequent program uses the previous's output. So the first program's output is the second's input, which is a string of numbers, but the second program is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. That's a problem. So perhaps the first program's output is not the second's input, but the second program's input is a different part. Maybe the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed step by step, assuming that the three files are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input, even if the data types don't align. Perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three files are separate, and the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. The problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So the C program must read all the inputs needed for all three steps, process them in sequence, and output the final result.\n\nWait, that might make sense. The first Python file requires N, M, edges. The second requires a string (the 'g' and 'p' string). The third requires another string (the punctuation string). So the C program must read all three inputs in sequence, process each step, and output the final result.\n\nAh! That's probably the correct approach. The problem says the entire sequence is to be translated into a single C program. So the first Python program's input is the first part of the input, then the second program's input comes next, then the third's input. The outputs of each step are not used as inputs to the next, but the entire sequence is to be done in one C program. Wait, but the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But given the code, that's impossible. So perhaps the problem's code is wrong, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are separate, and the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. The problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So the C program must read all the inputs needed for all three steps, process them in sequence, and output the final result. The outputs of the first and second steps are not used as inputs to the next steps, but the entire sequence is done in one program. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the second's input, but the second program's input is a string of numbers, which is then processed as 'g's and 'p's. For example, maybe the numbers are converted into 'g's and 'p's somehow. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but according to the code, it's numbers. So perhaps the first program's code is wrong, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the second's input, but the second program is supposed to read numbers and process them as 'g's and 'p's. For example, even numbers are 'g's and odd are 'p's. But that's just a guess. But the problem's code is given, so I have to proceed with the code as written.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are not connected, and the problem is to translate each into C code, but in a single program. So the C program will have three separate functions, each processing their own input, and the final output is the third's result. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next, so that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the three files are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input, even if the data types don't align. So the first program's output is the second's input, which is a string of numbers, but the second program is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. So the second program would process that string as is, leading to an incorrect result, but I have to proceed as per the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the code as given, and see how to structure the C program.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read the first input (for the first Python file's processing). This includes N, M, then M edges. Then process this data as per the first Python file, generating the output (the pairs of numbers). But instead of printing them, store them in a buffer.\n\n2. Then, take that buffer as the input for the second part's processing (the second Python file). The second part expects a string (the input is read as a string). So the buffer from the first part's output is treated as the input string for the second part. The second part processes it and produces an integer score. Store that as the second output.\n\n3. Then, take that score (as a string?) and pass it to the third part's processing. The third part expects a string (input()), so the second's output (the score) is converted to a string and passed as input. The third part processes it and outputs the formatted string.\n\nFinally, the third's output is printed.\n\nBut this requires that the first's output is a string that the second can process, and the second's output is a string for the third. But the first's output is numbers, so the second would process them as characters. For example, if the first outputs \"1 2\\n3 4\", then the second's input is that string, which is processed as '1', ' ', '2', '\\n', etc. But the second program is looking for 'g's and 'p's, so this would not work. But perhaps the problem's code is correct, and I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not used, and the second and third are separate. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. I'm not sure, but I'll proceed with the assumption that the three files are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input, even if the data types don't align. I'll proceed to code accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the C program.\n\nFirst, the first part (file1):\n\nThe first part reads N and M, then M edges. Then processes the edges, and prints pairs of numbers. The output is the printed lines. In C, I need to capture this output into a buffer instead of printing it. So instead of printf, store the output in a string.\n\nThe second part (file2) takes that string as input, processes it, and outputs a score. The score is an integer, so the second's output is a string representation of that integer.\n\nThe third part (file3) takes that score string as input, processes it (but the third expects a string with punctuation?), and outputs the formatted string.\n\nWait, but the third's input is supposed to be a string with punctuation. If the second's output is a number like \"5\", then the third would process \"5\" as a string, which has no punctuation. So the output would be \"5\".\n\nBut according to the third Python file's code, it's processing a string with punctuation. So perhaps the third's input is not the second's output, but another input. This is getting too confusing. Maybe the problem's code is wrong, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are separate, and the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each takes their own input. The problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So the C program must read all the inputs needed for all three steps, process them in sequence, and output the final result. The outputs of the first and second steps are not used as inputs to the next steps, but the entire sequence is done in one program. That makes sense.\n\nAh! That must be the case. The problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", but perhaps the user is supposed to run them in sequence, but each program's input is separate. So the first program's input is the first part of the input, the second's input is the second part, etc. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program, so the C program must read all the inputs needed for all three steps, process them in sequence, and output the final result. The outputs of the first and second steps are not used as inputs to the next steps, but the entire sequence is done in one program. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So the C program must process the first's input, generate the first's output, then use that as input to the second's processing, then use the second's output as input to the third's processing, and finally output the third's result.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the first input (for the first part), process it, store the first's output (the pairs of numbers as a string).\n\n2. Use that string as input to the second part's processing, which produces a score (integer), stored as a string.\n\n3. Use that score string as input to the third part's processing, which produces the final formatted string.\n\nFinally, print the third's output.\n\nSo the first part's output is a string of numbers, which is the second's input. The second's output is a number (as a string), which is the third's input. The third processes that string (e.g., \"5\") and outputs it formatted (maybe as \"5\" again, since there's no punctuation).\n\nBut according to the third Python file's code, it's processing a string with punctuation. So perhaps the third's input is not the second's output, but another input. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three files are separate, and the problem's description is incorrect. The user wants to translate each Python file into C code, but in a single C program that does all three steps in sequence, with each step's input read from the user, and the final output is the third's result. So the C program will read all the inputs needed for all three steps, process them in sequence, and output the final result.\n\nIn that case, the C program would:\n\n- Read the first part's input (N, M, edges).\n\n- Process it as per the first Python file, but instead of printing, store the output (the pairs) in a buffer.\n\n- Then read the second part's input (the 'g' and 'p' string).\n\n- Process it as per the second Python file, getting the score.\n\n- Then read the third part's input (the punctuation string).\n\n- Process it as per the third Python file, and output the result.\n\nBut the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first's output must be the second's input, and the second's output must be the third's input. So the C program must not read the second and third inputs separately, but instead the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the first input (for the first part).\n\n- Process it, generating the first's output (pairs of numbers as a string).\n\n- Use that string as the second's input, process it to get the score (as a string).\n\n- Use that score string as the third's input, process it to get the final output.\n\nThus, the C program must:\n\n- Read the first input (N, M, edges).\n\n- Process first part, store output in a buffer.\n\n- Process second part using that buffer as input, store the score as a string.\n\n- Process third part using that score string as input, store the final result.\n\n- Print the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in C.\n\nFirst part (file1):\n\nThe first part's code is complex. Let's see:\n\nIt reads N and M, then M edges. Then builds edges as sets (but in C, we can represent edges as adjacency lists using arrays of linked lists or arrays of arrays. Since in Python, edges are stored as sets, but in C, perhaps using arrays of integers with a count.\n\nWait, the Python code uses edges as a list of sets. Each edge is bidirectional. So for each edge a-b, both edges[a-1].add(b-1) and edges[b-1].add(a-1). So in C, perhaps we can represent edges as an array of arrays, but dynamically sized. Alternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can use an adjacency list with a list for each node.\n\nBut in C, dynamic arrays are tricky. Alternatively, since the maximum N is not given, but assuming it's manageable, perhaps we can use a linked list or a fixed-size array.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can represent each edge as a list of nodes connected to each node. For each node, we can have an array of pointers to the connected nodes. But in C, this requires dynamic memory allocation.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are stored as sets in Python, perhaps in C we can use a bitmask or a boolean array for each node's edges. But that might be memory-intensive for large N.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can represent each edge as a list of nodes connected to each node. For each node, we can have an array of integers (the connected nodes), and a count of how many there are.\n\nLet me think of the steps in the first Python file:\n\nThe code reads N and M, then M edges. For each edge a and b (1-based), it adds b-1 to edges[a-1], and a-1 to edges[b-1]. Also, the degree of each node is tracked in degs.\n\nThen, if M is odd, it prints -1 and exits.\n\nThen, it uses a priority queue (heap) to process nodes with the smallest degree first. The heap is a min-heap based on degree and node index.\n\nThe processing loop:\n\nWhile the heap is not empty:\n\n- Extract the node u with the smallest degree.\n\n- If already flagged (processed), skip.\n\n- Mark as processed.\n\n- For each neighbor v in edges[u]:\n\n   - Remove u from edges[v] (since the edge is now used).\n\n   - Depending on parity of u, decide which order to print.\n\n   - Print either u+1 and v+1 or v+1 and u+1.\n\n   - Update the parity of the node (u or v).\n\n   - Decrement the degree of v.\n\n   - Push v's new degree into the heap.\n\nWait, but in Python, edges are sets, so removing u from edges[v] is done with edges[v].remove(u). But in C, if we have an adjacency list, removing an element from an array is tricky. So perhaps we need a way to represent the edges so that we can efficiently remove a node from another's list.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps when processing an edge between u and v, once it's processed, we can mark it as used. But this requires tracking which edges have been used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to avoid needing to remove edges. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be implemented with adjacency lists, and when processing a neighbor v, we can iterate through the list but track which edges have been used. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps each edge is stored twice (once in each direction), and when processing, we can just iterate through all edges but track which ones have been used.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the first part's code in C.\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nWe need to read N and M, then M edges. For each edge a and b (1-based), we add b-1 to edges[a-1], and a-1 to edges[b-1]. The edges are stored as adjacency lists.\n\nIn C, perhaps we can represent edges as an array of linked lists. Each node has a list of its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can use an array of arrays. But for dynamic sizes, we can use a linked list structure.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum N is not specified, but assuming it's manageable, perhaps we can use a fixed-size array of linked lists.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, let's use an array of arrays. Let's say each node's adjacency list is stored in an array, and we track the size.\n\nBut in C, this requires dynamic memory allocation. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, read N and M.\n\nThen, for each node, we can have an array of pointers to an array of integers. For example:\n\nint **edges;\nint *degs;\nint *parity;\nbool *flag;\n\nedges = malloc(N * sizeof(int *));\ndegs = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\nparity = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\nflag = malloc(N * sizeof(bool));\n\nfor (i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    edges[i] = NULL;\n    degs[i] = 0;\n    parity[i] = 0;\n    flag[i] = false;\n}\n\nThen, for each edge:\n\nfor each of M edges:\n    a, b = input()\n    a--, b--;\n    add b to edges[a]\n    add a to edges[b]\n    degs[a]++, degs[b]++;\n\nBut adding to the edges requires dynamically growing the arrays. So perhaps for each node's adjacency list, we can have an array and a current size and capacity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a linked list for each node's edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a list of edges for each node, stored as an array with a current size and capacity. Let's try this approach.\n\nEach node's edges can be stored as an array of integers, with a current size and capacity. For example:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *list;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} EdgeList;\n\nEdgeList *edges = malloc(N * sizeof(EdgeList));\n\nfor (i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    edges[i].list = malloc(16 * sizeof(int)); // initial capacity\n    edges[i].size = 0;\n    edges[i].capacity = 16;\n}\n\nThen, when adding a neighbor:\n\nvoid add_edge(EdgeList *edges, int a, int b) {\n    if (edges[a].size >= edges[a].capacity) {\n        edges[a].capacity *= 2;\n        edges[a].list = realloc(edges[a].list, edges[a].capacity * sizeof(int));\n    }\n    edges[a].list[edges[a].size++] = b;\n}\n\nSimilarly for adding b to a's list and vice versa.\n\nThis way, each edge is added to both nodes' adjacency lists.\n\nOnce the edges are built, the code checks if M is odd. If so, output -1 and exit.\n\nThen, the heap is initialized with (degree, node) pairs. The heap is a min-heap based on degree, then node index.\n\nIn C, we can implement a heap using an array. The heap elements are pairs (degree, node). We need to manage the heap structure.\n\nThe heap can be an array of structs:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int degree;\n    int node;\n} HeapElement;\n\nHeapElement *heap = malloc(M * sizeof(HeapElement)); // assuming M is the max possible size\nint heap_size = 0;\n\nThe heap functions (heapify, push, pop) need to be implemented.\n\nAlternatively, since the initial heap is built from all nodes, perhaps we can initialize the heap with all nodes, sorted by degree and node index.\n\nWait, the code in Python does:\n\nQ = []\nfor i, d in enumerate(degs):\n    Q.append((d, i))\nheapq.heapify(Q)\n\nSo the heap is initialized with all nodes, ordered by degree (smallest first), then node index.\n\nIn C, we can create an array of all nodes, sort them by degree and node, then build a heap.\n\nAlternatively, implement a min-heap.\n\nImplementing a heap in C:\n\nWe can have a function to push to the heap, and a function to pop the smallest element.\n\nAlternatively, use an array and manage it as a heap.\n\nThe main loop:\n\nwhile the heap is not empty:\n\n    get the smallest element (u's degree and node)\n\n    pop it from the heap.\n\n    if flag[u] is true, continue.\n\n    mark flag[u] as true.\n\n    iterate over each neighbor v in edges[u].\n\n    for each v:\n\n        remove u from edges[v]'s list. (This is tricky in C's adjacency list structure.)\n\nWait, in the Python code, after processing a neighbor v, the edge between u and v is removed from both edges[u] and edges[v]. But in the code, when processing the edge between u and v, the code does edges[v].remove(u). So in C, we need to remove u from edges[v]'s list.\n\nBut in the adjacency list structure I described earlier, each node's edges are stored in an array. To remove an element from the array, we need to find the index of u in edges[v].list, then shift elements. This could be O(n) time, which might be acceptable for small N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the edges in a way that allows for O(1) removal, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps when processing an edge between u and v, once it's processed, we can just not process it again. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without removing the edge from the adjacency list, but track which edges have been used. But this requires a way to track used edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed by iterating through the edges, but when processing a neighbor v, we can just proceed, and the edge will be processed only once.\n\nWait, looking at the Python code:\n\nIn the loop over edges[u], for each v in edges[u], the code does edges[v].remove(u). So after processing, the edge between u and v is removed from both lists. This is to prevent revisiting the edge again.\n\nTherefore, in C, when processing a neighbor v of u, we need to remove u from v's adjacency list.\n\nTo do this in the adjacency list structure:\n\nFor each v in edges[u], we need to find the index of u in edges[v].list, then remove it.\n\nThis can be done by iterating through edges[v].list until finding u, then shifting elements.\n\nThis is O(k) time for each edge, where k is the degree of v. For small N, this is manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each v in edges[u].list:\n\n    // remove u from edges[v].list\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < edges[v].size; j++) {\n        if (edges[v].list[j] == u) {\n            // found, remove it\n            for (int k = j; k < edges[v].size - 1; k++) {\n                edges[v].list[k] = edges[v].list[k+1];\n            }\n            edges[v].size--;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // then process the edge between u and v\n\n    // decide which order to print based on parity[u]\n\n    if (parity[u] != 0 && i == 0) { // wait, in Python, the loop is over the edges[u], and for the first iteration (i=0), it uses u first.\n\n    }\n\nWait, in the Python code:\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(edges[u]):\n\n    edges[v].remove(u)\n\n    if parity[u] != 0 and i == 0:\n\n        print(u+1, v+1)\n\n        parity[u] ^= 1\n\n    else:\n\n        print(v+1, u+1)\n\n        parity[v] ^= 1\n\n    degs[v] -=1\n\n    heapq.heappush(Q, (degs[v], v))\n\nSo the first iteration (i=0) of the loop over edges[u] (the neighbors of u) will check if parity[u] is not zero. If so, then print u and v, else print v and u.\n\nWait, the parity is toggled after each print. So the parity starts at 0 for all nodes.\n\nInitially, parity[u] is 0. So for the first iteration (i=0), since parity[u] is 0, the else clause is taken, so print v and u, and toggle parity[v].\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif parity[u] !=0 and i ==0:\n\n    print u, v\n\n    parity[u] = 1 - parity[u]\n\nelse:\n\n    print v, u\n\n    parity[v] = 1 - parity[v]\n\nWait, the first time through the loop (i=0), if parity[u] is 0 (initially), then the else clause is taken, so the first edge is printed as v u, and parity[v] is toggled.\n\nThen, for the next edges (i>0), regardless of parity[u], the else clause is taken, so the edge is printed as v u, and parity[v] is toggled.\n\nWait, but the parity of u is only toggled when the first condition is met (parity[u] !=0 and i==0).\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The parity is used to decide the order of printing for the first edge of the current node.\n\nThe parity starts at 0 for all nodes. So for the first edge of a node u (i=0), if parity[u] is 0, then the else clause is taken, so the edge is printed as v u, and parity[v] is toggled.\n\nWait, but the parity of v is toggled here. So the next time v is processed, its parity will be 1.\n\nThis is getting complex. To implement this in C, we need to track the parity for each node, and for each edge, decide the order based on the current parity of u and the iteration index.\n\nSo in C:\n\nfor each v in edges[u].list (before removing u from v's list):\n\n    // remove u from edges[v].list\n\n    // then process the edge:\n\n    if (parity[u] != 0 && i == 0) {\n\n        // print u and v\n\n        parity[u] ^= 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // print v and u\n\n        parity[v] ^= 1;\n\n    }\n\n    // decrement degs[v]\n\n    degs[v]--;\n\n    // push (degs[v], v) to the heap\n\n    // but in C, we need to manage the heap.\n\nWait, but in C, the heap is a separate structure. So after modifying degs[v], we need to push the new (degs[v], v) into the heap.\n\nBut in the Python code, the heap is a priority queue, so when we push (degs[v], v), it will be placed in the correct position.\n\nImplementing the heap in C requires a custom heap structure.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's think of the steps needed for the first part in C.\n\nFirst, read N and M.\n\nThen read M edges, build the adjacency lists.\n\nCheck if M is odd: if yes, output -1 and exit.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nInitialize the heap with all nodes, sorted by degree and node index.\n\nThen, while the heap is not empty:\n\n    extract the node u with smallest degree (and smallest index if tie).\n\n    if flag[u] is set, skip.\n\n    mark flag[u] as true.\n\n    iterate over each neighbor v in edges[u].\n\n    for each v:\n\n        remove u from edges[v]'s list.\n\n        determine the order to print based on parity[u] and the iteration index (i).\n\n        toggle the appropriate parity.\n\n        decrement degs[v].\n\n        push (degs[v], v) into the heap.\n\n    // but how to track the iteration index (i) for the edges[u] list?\n\nWait, in the Python code, the loop over edges[u] is done with enumerate, so i starts at 0 for the first element.\n\nIn C, when iterating over edges[u].list, the first element is index 0, so we can track i as the loop counter.\n\nSo in C:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < edges[u].size; i++) {\n\n    int v = edges[u].list[i];\n\n    // remove u from edges[v].list\n\n    // then process the edge.\n\n    // decide the order based on parity[u] and i.\n\n    // etc.\n\n}\n\nBut after removing u from edges[v].list, the edges[u].list may have changed, but since we are iterating over the original edges[u].list, this is okay.\n\nWait, no. Because when we process the edges[u].list, we are iterating over the current list. But when we remove u from edges[v].list, that doesn't affect edges[u].list. The edges[u].list contains all the neighbors before processing. So the loop over edges[u].list can proceed as normal.\n\nWait, the edges[u].list is the list of neighbors before any removals. So the loop over edges[u].list is over the original list. The removal of u from edges[v].list is done for the other direction, but doesn't affect edges[u].list.\n\nTherefore, the loop can proceed.\n\nOnce the order is decided, the pair is added to the output buffer.\n\nThe output buffer for the first part is a string that will be the input to the second part.\n\nSo in C, we can have a buffer (char buffer1[...]) to store the output of the first part.\n\nEach time a pair is printed in the first part, we append it to buffer1.\n\nOnce the first part is done, we can process the second part using buffer1 as input.\n\nThe second part (file2):\n\nThe second part reads a string (the input is the first's output, which is the pairs of numbers as a string). The code processes this string to compute a score based on 'g's and 'p's.\n\nWait, but the first's output is numbers, so the second's input is a string of numbers and spaces/newlines. The second program's code is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. This is a problem. But according to the problem's setup, this must be done. So the second part will process the string of numbers as if they were 'g's and 'p's. For example, '1' is treated as 'g', '2' as 'p', etc. But this is incorrect, but we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not used, and the second part's input is a separate string. But according to the problem's instructions, the output of each program is the input to the next. So I have to proceed.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\ns = list(input())\n\nnum_g, num_p = 0,0\n\nscore =0\n\nfor x in s:\n\n    if x == 'g':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            score +=1\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n    elif x == 'p':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            score -=1\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # ignore other characters?\n\n        pass\n\nprint(score)\n\nWait, the code in the second Python file has some logic. Let me re-express it:\n\nFor each character in the input string s:\n\nif the character is 'g':\n\n    if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n        score +=1\n\n        num_p +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        num_g +=1\n\nelif the character is 'p':\n\n    if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n        num_p +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        score -=1\n\n        num_g +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    ignore.\n\nWait, the code for 'p' case:\n\nif (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n    do nothing except increment num_p?\n\nWait, the code for 'p' is:\n\nelif x == 'p':\n\n    if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n        score = score\n\n        num_p +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        score -=1\n\n        num_g +=1\n\nWait, the code in the second Python file has:\n\nfor x in s:\n\n    if x == 'g':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            score +=1\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            score = score\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    elif x == 'p':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            score = score\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            score -=1\n\n            num_g +=1\n\nSo for 'g':\n\nif (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n    score increases by 1, and num_p increases by 1.\n\nelse:\n\n    num_g increases by 1.\n\nFor 'p':\n\nif (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n    num_p increases by 1.\n\nelse:\n\n    score decreases by 1, and num_g increases by 1.\n\nThe other characters are ignored.\n\nThe goal is to compute the score based on these rules.\n\nIn C, the second part's input is the first's output (the string of numbers and spaces). So the input string is something like \"1 2\\n3 4\\n...\" etc.\n\nThe second part processes each character in this string. For each character, if it's 'g' or 'p', it's processed. Otherwise, ignored.\n\nBut the first's output contains numbers and spaces, so the second part will process the '1', ' ', '2', etc. characters. The ' ' and '\\n' are ignored, but the digits are also ignored unless they are 'g' or 'p'.\n\nThis will result in a score of 0, since none of the characters are 'g' or 'p'. But according to the problem's setup, this must be done.\n\nSo the second part's output is the score (probably 0), which is then passed to the third part.\n\nThe third part (file3):\n\nThe third part reads a string (the second's output, which is a number like \"5\"). It processes this string to format punctuation.\n\nThe third Python code:\n\ns = input()\n\nres = []\n\npunctuation = [',', '.', '!', '?']\n\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n\n    if i >=1:\n\n        if s[i] == '':  # this is a mistake, since s[i] can't be empty string.\n\n            if res[-1] != '':\n\n                res.append(s[i])\n\n            else:\n\n                continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if s[i] in punctuation:\n\n                if res[-1] == '':\n\n                    res.pop()\n\n                res.append(s[i])\n\n                res.append('')\n\n            else:\n\n                res.append(s[i])\n\n    else:\n\n        if s[i] == '':\n\n            continue\n\n        if s[i] in punctuation:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            res.append(s[i])\n\nprint(''.join(res))\n\nWait, there are some issues in the Python code. For example, checking if s[i] == '' is incorrect because characters are single characters, not empty strings. So this condition is always false. Also, the code has some logic for handling punctuation with spaces.\n\nThe code's intention is probably to format the string such that punctuation is followed by a space, but not sure.\n\nBut given the code as written, in C, the third part's input is the second's output (a number as a string, e.g., \"5\"). The third part processes this string.\n\nThe code's logic for the third part:\n\nInitialize res as empty list.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\nif it's the first character (i=0):\n\n    if the character is empty (can't be), skip.\n\n    if it's punctuation, skip.\n\n    else, add to res.\n\nElse:\n\n    if current character is empty (can't be), then check previous.\n\n    else:\n\n        if current is punctuation:\n\n            if last element in res is empty, pop it.\n\n            append the punctuation and then an empty string.\n\n        else:\n\n            append the character.\n\nFinally, join res and print.\n\nBut since the input is a number like \"5\", the processing would be:\n\nres starts empty.\n\nFirst character '5' (i=0):\n\n    not empty, not punctuation, so added to res. res is ['5'].\n\nThen, for the next characters (none), so the loop ends.\n\nThe final result is '5'.\n\nSo the third part's output is the same as the input (the number as a string).\n\nThus, the final output of the entire sequence would be the score from the second part, formatted as a string (same as the input to the third part).\n\nBut according to the problem's setup, this is the desired result.\n\nNow, putting it all together in C.\n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read the first input (N, M, edges).\n\n2. Process the first part, storing the output in a buffer.\n\n3. Process the second part using that buffer as input, storing the score as a string.\n\n4. Process the third part using that score string as input, storing the final result.\n\n5. Print the final result.\n\nNow, let's outline the C code structure.\n\nFirst, the first part's processing:\n\nWe need to read N and M, then M edges. Then build the adjacency lists, process the edges, and collect the output pairs into a buffer.\n\nThe second part's processing takes the buffer from the first part, processes it to compute the score, and stores it as a string.\n\nThe third part's processing takes the score string, processes it, and outputs the formatted string.\n\nNow, let's start coding.\n\nFirst, the first part's code.\n\nBut this is quite involved. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's code in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Define EdgeList structure\ntypedef struct {\n    int *list;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} EdgeList;\n\n// Heap element structure\ntypedef struct {\n    int degree;\n    int node;\n} HeapElement;\n\n// Function prototypes\nvoid add_edge(EdgeList *edges, int a, int b);\nvoid heap_push(HeapElement *heap, int *heap_size, HeapElement elem);\nHeapElement heap_pop(HeapElement *heap, int *heap_size);\nint compare(HeapElement a, HeapElement b);\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    // Read edges\n    EdgeList *edges = malloc(N * sizeof(EdgeList));\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        edges[i].list = malloc(16 * sizeof(int));\n        edges[i].size = 0;\n        edges[i].capacity = 16;\n    }\n\n    int *degs = calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n    int *parity = calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n    bool *flag = calloc(N, sizeof(bool));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        a--;\n        b--;\n        add_edge(edges, a, b);\n        add_edge(edges, b, a);\n        degs[a]++;\n        degs[b]++;\n    }\n\n    if (M % 2 != 0) {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize heap\n    HeapElement *heap = malloc(N * sizeof(HeapElement));\n    int heap_size = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        heap_push(heap, &heap_size, (HeapElement){degs[i], i});\n    }\n\n    // Buffer for first part's output\n    char buffer1[100000] = \"\"; // Assuming sufficient size\n    int buffer1_len = 0;\n\n    while (heap_size > 0) {\n        HeapElement current = heap_pop(heap, &heap_size);\n        int u = current.node;\n\n        if (flag[u]) continue;\n        flag[u] = true;\n\n        // Iterate over edges[u]\n        for (int i = 0; i < edges[u].size; i++) {\n            int v = edges[u].list[i];\n\n            // Remove u from edges[v]\n            for (int j = 0; j < edges[v].size; j++) {\n                if (edges[v].list[j] == u) {\n                    for (int k = j; k < edges[v].size - 1; k++) {\n                        edges[v].list[k] = edges[v].list[k+1];\n                    }\n                    edges[v].size--;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Determine print order\n            int is_first = (i == 0);\n            if (parity[u] != 0 && is_first) {\n                // Print u+1 v+1\n                int len = snprintf(NULL, 0, \"%d %d\\n\", u+1, v+1);\n                if (buffer1_len + len + 1 > sizeof(buffer1)) {\n                    // Handle buffer overflow, but assuming it's okay for now\n                }\n                snprintf(buffer1 + buffer1_len, sizeof(buffer1) - buffer1_len, \"%d %d\\n\", u+1, v+1);\n                buffer1_len += len;\n                parity[u] ^= 1;\n            } else {\n                // Print v+1 u+1\n                int len = snprintf(NULL, 0, \"%d %d\\n\", v+1, u+1);\n                snprintf(buffer1 + buffer1_len, sizeof(buffer1) - buffer1_len, \"%d %d\\n\", v+1, u+1);\n                buffer1_len += len;\n                parity[v] ^= 1;\n            }\n\n            // Decrement degree of v\n            degs[v]--;\n            // Push to heap\n            heap_push(heap, &heap_size, (HeapElement){degs[v], v});\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now process second part using buffer1 as input\n\n    // Second part's processing\n    char *input2 = buffer1;\n    int num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; input2[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = input2[i];\n        if (c == 'g') {\n            if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                score++;\n                num_p++;\n            } else {\n                num_g++;\n            }\n        } else if (c == 'p') {\n            if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                num_p++;\n            } else {\n                score--;\n                num_g++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Convert score to string for third part's input\n    char buffer2[20];\n    snprintf(buffer2, sizeof(buffer2), \"%d\", score);\n\n    // Third part's processing\n    char *input3 = buffer2;\n    char res[1000] = \"\";\n    int res_len = 0;\n    char *punctuation = \",.!?\";\n\n    for (int i = 0; input3[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = input3[i];\n        if (i == 0) {\n            if (c == ' ' || c == '\\0') continue;\n            if (strchr(punctuation, c)) continue;\n            res[res_len++] = c;\n        } else {"
