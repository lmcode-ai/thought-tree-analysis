So the code can be written as:\n\nfor (int b=0; b<60; b++) {\n\n    int bs =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i < n; i++) { if ( (A[i] >> b) & 1 ) {\n\n            bs++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    long long pow2 = 1LL << b;\n\n    long long term = ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % mod ) * pow2 % mod;\n\n    result = (result + term) % mod;\n\n} Wait, but the mod is applied to the entire term. Wait, but the term is (bs*(n-bs) * (1<<b)) mod mod. Yes, so the order is:\n\nbs*(n-bs) mod mod, then multiply by (1<<b mod mod), then mod mod again. Alternatively, since (a*b*c) mod mod = ( ( (a mod mod) * (b mod mod) ) mod mod * (c mod mod) ) mod mod. So the code above is okay.",

But since 2^b can be up to 2^59, which is way bigger than mod (1e9+7), so we can compute pow2 mod mod first. So pow2 = (1LL << b) % mod; Then term = (bs * (n - bs) % mod) * pow2 % mod; Wait, but even better:\n\nterm = ( ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % mod ) * ( (1LL << b) % mod ) ) % mod;\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to compute pow2 as (1LL << b) % mod. Alternatively, compute pow2 as (1 << b) mod mod. Yes, that's better to prevent overflow when multiplying. Wait, but 1LL << b can be up to 2^59, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer. So when multiplied by (bs*(n-bs)), which can be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, the product is up to 1e10 * 2^59 \u2248 5e29, which is way beyond 64 bits. So we must compute modulo mod at each step. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each part modulo mod. So:\n\npow2 = (1LL << b) % mod;\n\ntemp1 = (bs * (n - bs)) % mod;\n\nterm = (temp1 * pow2) % mod;\n\nresult = (result + term) % mod; Yes, that's better. So the code for the first part is okay. Now, after computing the result, we need to convert it to a string. In C, we can use sprintf to write the number into a string. char s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", result);\n\nThen, check the length of s.\n\nint len = strlen(s);\n\nif (len ! =4) {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nThen, check the counts. Initialize an array count[10] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n    int c = s[i] - '0';\n\n    count[c]++;\n\n}\n\nThen, check that exactly two of the counts are 2, and others are 0. int has_two =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n        has_two++;\n\n    } else if (count[i] !=0) {\n\n        // some count is not 2, so invalid\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (has_two ! =2) {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\"); }\n\nWait, but the loop over count[i] can be done as:\n\nint valid =1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ! =0 && count[i] ! =2) {\n\n        valid =0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (valid) {\n\n    // check that exactly two non-zero counts. int cnt =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n        if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n            cnt++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (cnt ==2) {\n\n        printf(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, first check all counts are 0 or 2, then count how many are 2. Alternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nint count2 =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n        count2++;\n\n    } else if (count[i] ! =0) {\n\n        // invalid\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (count2 ==2) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n} Yes, that's better. So putting it all together. Now, putting all the code into a single C program. The steps are:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute the result as per first program. Convert result to string s.\n\nCheck length is 4. Check the counts of digits in s.\n\nOutput \"Yes\" or \"No\". Now, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    long long A[n];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &A[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    long long result =0;\n\n    for (int b=0; b<60; b++) {\n\n        int bs =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { if ( (A[i] >> b) & 1 ) {\n\n                bs++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        long long pow2 = (1LL << b) % MOD;\n\n        long long temp = ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % MOD ) * pow2 % MOD;\n\n        result = (result + temp) % MOD;\n\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second and third steps. char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", result);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    if (len ! =4) {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    int count[10] = {0};\n\n    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n        int c = s[i] - '0';\n\n        count[c]++;\n\n    }\n\n    int count2 =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) { if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n            count2++;\n\n        } else if (count[i] ! =0) {\n\n            printf(\"No\");\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (count2 ==2) {\n\n        printf(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but what about negative results?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each part.\n\nFirst, the first Python file reads N and an array A, then calculates some result based on bitwise operations and outputs it modulo 1e9+7. The second file takes an input string and replaces commas with spaces, then prints that. The third file checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice, and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nThe challenge is to chain these together in C. Since the original setup is that each Python file's output is the next's input, the C program must process the input through all three steps in sequence without I/O in the middle.\n\nWait, but how do the outputs connect? Let me see the flow:\n\nThe first Python file's input is from user, and its output is the result (the first's output). But the second file's input is probably the same as the first's input? Or wait, no. Wait, the original setup is that each program is run in sequence, so the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, the user runs the three files in sequence, so the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output. So the C program must read the initial input (for the first program), process through all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nWait, but the first Python program's input is two lines: first N, then the list of integers. The second program's input is whatever the first's output was, but the first's output is a number (the result). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking at the first Python file:\n\nThe first file's code:\n\nThe first line reads N as input(). Then the second line reads a list of integers (split from input().split()), stored in A as a numpy array. Then it computes the result and prints it. So the first program's output is a single integer (the result). Then the second program takes that integer as input? But the second program's code is:\n\nprint(input().replace(\",\", \" \"))\n\nWait, input() here would be reading a line. But the first program's output is a number, like \"12345\". So the second program would read that as a string, then replace commas with spaces. But if the first's output has no commas, then the second's output is the same as the first's output. Then the third program takes that as input, which is a number again, but the third program expects a string S where each character is part of the check. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. Let me re-examine the problem statement again. The user is given three Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nBut looking at the first program's output: it's a number (the result variable). The second program takes that as input, which is a string (since input() in Python reads a line as a string). The second program then replaces commas with spaces in that string, then outputs it. Then the third program takes that output (the modified string) as its input S, and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so when printed, it's a string like \"12345\\n\". The second program would read that as a string, so input().replace(\",\", \" \") would just be the same string (since there's no commas). So the second's output is the same as the first's output. Then the third program would take that number as a string, e.g., \"12345\", and check if it has two distinct characters each appearing twice. But \"12345\" has 5 characters, so it would output \"No\".\n\nHmm, that seems odd. Maybe the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a string with commas? Wait, perhaps the first program's input is such that the output is a string with commas. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first program's code is:\n\nThe first line reads N as an integer. The second line reads a list of integers from input().split(). The result is computed and printed. The printed result is a single integer. So the first program's output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. So the second program's output is the same string (since there are no commas to replace). Then the third program takes that string (the number) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. For example, if the first program's output was 1122, then the string is \"1122\", which has two distinct characters (1 and 2), each appearing twice. So the third program would output \"Yes\".\n\nAh, so the overall process is that the first program's output is a number, which is then passed to the second program, which just outputs it (since no commas), then the third program checks if that number's string representation has exactly two distinct digits each appearing twice.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input (for the first program's N and array A), compute the first's result, then process that result through the second and third steps, and output the final \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read N and the array A (as per first Python file's input).\n\n2. Compute the result as per the first program's logic.\n\n3. Then, take that result as a string (the output of first program), process it through the second step (replace commas with spaces, but since the result is a number, no commas, so the string remains the same).\n\n4. Then, take that string (the same as the first's output) and process it through the third step's logic (count characters, check conditions).\n\n5. Finally, output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo the C program must do all these steps in sequence, without any intermediate I/O except the initial read and final output.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nFirst part: the first Python program's logic.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nRead N, then read a list of integers as A. Then for each bit from 0 to 59, compute the number of set bits in that position across all elements of A. Then compute the result as sum over bits of (bs * (N - bs) * 2^b), mod 1e9+7.\n\nIn C, we can read N, then read N integers into an array. Then loop over each bit from 0 to 59. For each bit, count how many numbers in the array have that bit set. Then accumulate the result as per the formula.\n\nSecond part: the second Python program's logic is to replace commas with spaces in the input string. Since the input here is the first's output (a number), which has no commas, this step does nothing. So in C, the string to process is the string representation of the first's result. Since there are no commas, the string remains the same. So this step can be skipped in the C code, but we have to represent the string as the result's string.\n\nThird part: the third program's logic is to check if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the input string must be of length 4, with two characters each appearing twice. Wait, no, the length can be 4 (like \"aabb\"), but maybe other lengths? Wait, the condition is that the set size is 2, and each character's count is exactly 2. So the total length must be 4. So the input string must be exactly four characters long, with two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nIt reads S as input(). Then counts the frequency with Counter. Then checks if the set has size 2. Then for each character in the set, checks if its count is 2. If all pass, output yes.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nTake the string (from the first's result, after second's processing, which is same as first's output as a string), check if its length is 4, and has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nWait, but the first's output could be a number with more or fewer digits. For example, if the first's result is 1234, then the string is \"1234\", which has four distinct characters, so third would output \"No\". If the result is 1122, then the string is \"1122\", which has two characters each twice, so \"Yes\".\n\nSo the C program must:\n\nAfter computing the first's result, convert it to a string (without commas, so the second step's processing is redundant here), then check the string's characters.\n\nNow, putting it all together in C.\n\nFirst, read N and the array A.\n\nRead N via scanf(\"%d\", &N). Then read N integers into an array of size N.\n\nThen compute the result as per the first program's logic.\n\nThen, convert the result to a string. Since the result can be up to (60 bits) which is 2^60, which is a very large number, but modulo 1e9+7, so the maximum possible result is 1e9+6, which is a 10-digit number. So the string can be stored in a buffer of, say, 20 characters (including null terminator).\n\nThen, process the string through the second step (replace commas with spaces). Since the first's output is a number, the string won't have commas, so this step can be skipped. So the string remains as is.\n\nThen, process the string through the third step's logic.\n\nCheck the length of the string. If it's not exactly 4, then output \"No\".\n\nElse, count the frequency of each character. Since there are only two distinct characters, each must have count 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the frequency of each character. Let's see:\n\nInitialize an array of counts for each possible character (since it's a string of digits, maybe? Or could be letters? Wait, the first program's output is a number, so the string is digits. So the characters are 0-9, but maybe leading zeros? Well, the first program's output is a number, so leading zeros would not be present unless the result is zero. But the problem's input may have leading zeros in the array, but the first program's output is a number, so leading zeros would be stripped. So the string is a number's string representation, so digits only.\n\nWait, but the third program's input could be any string, but in this case, it's the output of the first program, which is a number. So the string is a sequence of digits. So the third program's check is on those digits.\n\nSo in C:\n\nAfter converting the result to a string, let's call it s.\n\nCheck the length of s. If it's not 4, then output \"No\".\n\nElse, check that exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.\n\nAlternatively, count the occurrences of each character. Let's do that.\n\nInitialize an array count[128] (or just for digits 0-9) to zero.\n\nLoop through each character in s:\n\nfor each char c in s:\n\n    count[c]++;\n\nThen, collect the non-zero counts. There should be exactly two elements in the count array with non-zero values, and each of those counts must be 2.\n\nAlternatively, since the length is 4, the sum of counts must be 4, and the two counts must be 2 each.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck length is 4.\n\nThen, collect the counts. Let's have two variables, a and b, which are the counts of the two different characters.\n\nInitialize variables first and second.\n\nLoop through the characters in s:\n\ncount each character.\n\nThen, collect the counts. Let's see:\n\nInitialize an array of counts for each possible character (since it's digits, 0-9, but maybe other characters? Well, the first's output is a number, so only digits and possibly a minus sign if negative, but since the result is mod 1e9+7, which is positive, so the string is digits only, no minus.\n\nWait, the first program's result is computed as (result + ... ) % 1e9+7, so it's non-negative. So the string is a non-negative number, so digits 0-9, no commas, so the second step's processing is redundant.\n\nSo the string is digits only.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nchar s[20]; // enough for 1e9+7 which is 10 digits, plus null.\n\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", result); // assuming result is a long long.\n\nThen, check the length of s. If it's not 4, output \"No\".\n\nElse, count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nInitialize an array of 10 integers (for digits 0-9) to zero.\n\nfor (i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n    digit = s[i] - '0';\n    count[digit]++;\n}\n\nThen, collect the non-zero counts.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nint count1 = 0, count2 = 0;\n\nint found = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n    if (count[i] >0) {\n        if (found ==0) {\n            count1 = count[i];\n            found =1;\n        } else if (found ==1) {\n            count2 = count[i];\n            found =2;\n        } else {\n            // more than two distinct digits\n            goto no;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nif (found !=2) goto no;\n\nif (count1 ==2 && count2 ==2) {\n    printf(\"Yes\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"No\");\n}\n\nWait, but maybe the counts could be in any order. So the two counts must both be 2.\n\nAlternatively, collect all the counts and check that exactly two are 2, and the rest are zero.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the counts array, collect all non-zero counts into a list, then check if the list has exactly two elements, each 2.\n\nAlternatively, sum the counts where count[i] !=2, but that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the counts array:\n\nint total =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n    if (count[i] !=0) {\n        if (count[i] !=2) {\n            // invalid\n            goto no;\n        }\n        total++;\n    }\n}\n\nif (total !=2) goto no;\n\nThen proceed to yes.\n\nHmm, that might be better.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck length is 4.\n\nCheck that exactly two distinct digits, each with count 2.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the first part: the first program's logic.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nresult starts at 0.\n\nfor each bit from 0 to 59:\n\n    compute the number of elements in A where the b-th bit is set.\n\n    bs is that count.\n\n    result += bs * (N - bs) * (1 << b)\n\n    mod 1e9+7 each time.\n\nIn C, we can do this with loops.\n\nWe need to read N, then an array of N integers (64-bit, but in C, perhaps using long long).\n\nWait, the original uses numpy's fromiter with int64. So the elements are 64-bit integers. But in C, we can read them as long long (assuming 64-bit system).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead N via scanf(\"%d\", &n).\n\nThen read N numbers into an array of long long:\n\nlong long A[n]; // but variable-length arrays may not be standard, but in C99 it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation, but perhaps better to read into an array.\n\nWait, but in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99. So assuming that's okay.\n\nSo:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nlong long A[n];\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &A[i]);\n\n}\n\nThen compute the result.\n\nInitialize result as 0.\n\nmod = 1000000007;\n\nfor (int b=0; b<60; b++) {\n\n    int bs =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n        if ( (A[i] >> b) & 1 ) {\n\n            bs++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    long long term = ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % mod ) * (1LL << b) % mod;\n\n    result = (result + term) % mod;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the term could be very large. Let's see:\n\nbs can be up to N (which can be up to, say, 1e5?), but 1<<b can be up to 2^59 which is about 5e17. So multiplying bs*(n-bs)*(1<<b) could be up to (1e5)^2 * 1e18 = 1e28, which is way beyond 64-bit. So we need to compute modulo 1e9+7 at each step.\n\nWait, the formula is (bs*(N-bs)*(1<<b)) added to the result, then mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut since (1<<b) can be up to 2^59, which is about 5e17, and multiplied by N^2 (if N is up to say 1e5, then N^2 is 1e10, so total term is 5e27, which is way larger than 1e9+7. So we need to compute each term modulo mod, then add to result modulo mod.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nterm = (bs * (n - bs)) % mod;\n\nterm = term * ( (1LL << b) % mod ) % mod;\n\nresult = (result + term) % mod;\n\nWait, but (1 << b) can be up to 2^59, so modding it by mod first is better.\n\nYes, because (a * b) mod mod = ( (a mod mod) * (b mod mod) ) mod mod.\n\nSo for each term:\n\nbs is the count (integer up to N).\n\nSo:\n\nbs * (n - bs) can be up to N^2, which if N is up to 1e5, that's 1e10, which mod 1e9+7 is manageable.\n\nThen multiply by (1 << b) mod mod.\n\nSo:\n\nlong long pow2 = 1LL << b;\n\npow2 %= mod;\n\nlong long temp = (bs * (n - bs)) % mod;\n\ntemp = (temp * pow2) % mod;\n\nresult = (result + temp) % mod;\n\nWait, but 1 << b can be up to 2^59, which is a very big number. But mod is 1e9+7, so 2^b mod mod can be precomputed for each b from 0 to 59.\n\nAlternatively, compute pow2 as (1 << b) % mod.\n\nBut in C, shifting 1LL << b for b up to 59 is okay as 1LL is 64 bits, so 2^59 is 576460752303423488, which fits in 64 bits. So 1LL << b is okay.\n\nWait, 1LL << 60 would be 1152921504606846976, which is still within 64 bits (max is 9e18). So for b up to 59, it's okay.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfor (int b=0; b<60; b++) {\n\n    int bs =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if ( (A[i] >> b) & 1 ) {\n\n            bs++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    long long pow2 = 1LL << b;\n\n    long long term = ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % mod ) * pow2 % mod;\n\n    result = (result + term) % mod;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the mod is applied to the entire term. Wait, but the term is (bs*(n-bs) * (1<<b)) mod mod.\n\nYes, so the order is:\n\nbs*(n-bs) mod mod, then multiply by (1<<b mod mod), then mod mod again.\n\nAlternatively, since (a*b*c) mod mod = ( ( (a mod mod) * (b mod mod) ) mod mod * (c mod mod) ) mod mod.\n\nSo the code above is okay.\n\nWait, but pow2 is 1LL << b, which is 2^b. So (bs*(n-bs)) * (2^b) mod mod.\n\nBut since 2^b can be up to 2^59, which is way bigger than mod (1e9+7), so we can compute pow2 mod mod first.\n\nSo pow2 = (1LL << b) % mod;\n\nThen term = (bs * (n - bs) % mod) * pow2 % mod;\n\nWait, but even better:\n\nterm = ( ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % mod ) * ( (1LL << b) % mod ) ) % mod;\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to compute pow2 as (1LL << b) % mod.\n\nAlternatively, compute pow2 as (1 << b) mod mod.\n\nYes, that's better to prevent overflow when multiplying.\n\nWait, but 1LL << b can be up to 2^59, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer. So when multiplied by (bs*(n-bs)), which can be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, the product is up to 1e10 * 2^59 \u2248 5e29, which is way beyond 64 bits. So we must compute modulo mod at each step.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute each part modulo mod.\n\nSo:\n\npow2 = (1LL << b) % mod;\n\ntemp1 = (bs * (n - bs)) % mod;\n\nterm = (temp1 * pow2) % mod;\n\nresult = (result + term) % mod;\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the code for the first part is okay.\n\nNow, after computing the result, we need to convert it to a string.\n\nIn C, we can use sprintf to write the number into a string.\n\nchar s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", result);\n\nThen, check the length of s.\n\nint len = strlen(s);\n\nif (len !=4) {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nThen, check the counts.\n\nInitialize an array count[10] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n    int c = s[i] - '0';\n\n    count[c]++;\n\n}\n\nThen, check that exactly two of the counts are 2, and others are 0.\n\nint has_two =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n        has_two++;\n\n    } else if (count[i] !=0) {\n\n        // some count is not 2, so invalid\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (has_two !=2) {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop over count[i] can be done as:\n\nint valid =1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] !=0 && count[i] !=2) {\n\n        valid =0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (valid) {\n\n    // check that exactly two non-zero counts.\n\n    int cnt =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n        if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n            cnt++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (cnt ==2) {\n\n        printf(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, first check all counts are 0 or 2, then count how many are 2.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nint count2 =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n    if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n        count2++;\n\n    } else if (count[i] !=0) {\n\n        // invalid\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (count2 ==2) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all the code into a single C program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute the result as per first program.\n\nConvert result to string s.\n\nCheck length is 4.\n\nCheck the counts of digits in s.\n\nOutput \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    long long A[n];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &A[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    long long result =0;\n\n    for (int b=0; b<60; b++) {\n\n        int bs =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n            if ( (A[i] >> b) & 1 ) {\n\n                bs++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        long long pow2 = (1LL << b) % MOD;\n\n        long long temp = ( ( (long long)bs * (n - bs) ) % MOD ) * pow2 % MOD;\n\n        result = (result + temp) % MOD;\n\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second and third steps.\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", result);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    if (len !=4) {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    int count[10] = {0};\n\n    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n        int c = s[i] - '0';\n\n        count[c]++;\n\n    }\n\n    int count2 =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n\n        if (count[i] ==2) {\n\n            count2++;\n\n        } else if (count[i] !=0) {\n\n            printf(\"No\");\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (count2 ==2) {\n\n        printf(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but what about negative results? Since the first program uses modulo 1e9+7, the result is non-negative. So the string will not have a '-'.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case where the first's result is 1122 (string \"1122\") \u2192 should output Yes.\n\nAnother case: 1212 \u2192 counts 1:2, 2:2 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: 1112 \u2192 counts 1:3, 2:1 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 1234 \u2192 four different digits \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 1111 \u2192 two digits? No, only one digit, so no.\n\nAnother case: 12 \u2192 length 2 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 12345 \u2192 length 5 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 0000 \u2192 counts 0:4 \u2192 no (since two counts needed).\n\nWait, 0000 has only one digit (0), so count is 4 \u2192 so no.\n\nAnother case: 1223 \u2192 digits 1,2,3 \u2192 three distinct \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 1122 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: 1212 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: 11 \u2192 length 2 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 1234 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case: 112233 \u2192 length 6 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The result could be 0, which is \"0\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 no.\n\n- The result could be 1001 \u2192 \"1001\" \u2192 counts 1:2, 0:2 \u2192 yes.\n\nYes, that would be \"Yes\".\n\nAnother case: 1001 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: 1010 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the result is 10000 \u2192 length 5 \u2192 no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 9999 \u2192 counts 9:4 \u2192 no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check the code for possible errors.\n\nIn the first loop for counting bits:\n\nYes, for each bit from 0 to 59, and for each element in A, check if the bit is set.\n\nThe pow2 calculation is (1LL << b) mod MOD. Since 1LL is 64-bit, shifting 59 is okay.\n\nThe temp calculation is (bs*(n-bs) mod MOD) * pow2 mod MOD.\n\nYes.\n\nThe string conversion uses %lld, which is correct for long long.\n\nThe count array is for digits 0-9, which is correct.\n\nThe loop over the string's characters (4 times, since len is checked to be 4).\n\nYes.\n\nThe count2 variable counts how many digits have exactly 2 occurrences. If any digit has a non-zero count not equal to 2, it returns No.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work."
