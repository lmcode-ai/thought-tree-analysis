First, looking at File 1. It's generating a list 'li' by processing numbers from 1 to 370. The logic here is a bit involved. Let me break it down step by step. The loop runs from 1 to 370 (since range(1,371) in Python is up to 370 inclusive). For each i, they calculate the number of digits (count). If it's 1 digit, they add the number itself to the list.",

So in the C program, the first step is to read n from the user, then compute the value at index n-1 (since arrays are 0-based in C). So after building the li array, the first step's output is li[n-1]. Then, the second step (File 2's logic) takes that value as 'a', and outputs 1 if a is 0 else 0. Wait, in the second Python file, the code is:\n\ndef solve(tc):\n\n    a = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    print(1 if a ==0 else 0) So the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is an integer.

Ah, right! The array is declared as 1000 elements, but during the loop, we might be writing beyond that. Wait, the initial code in C:\n\nint li[1000]; // size 1000.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding each file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It's generating a list 'li' by processing numbers from 1 to 370. The logic here is a bit involved. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe loop runs from 1 to 370 (since range(1,371) in Python is up to 370 inclusive). For each i, they calculate the number of digits (count). If it's 1 digit, they add the number itself to the list. If it's 2 or 3 digits, they split the digits into a temporary list and reverse them before adding to 'li'. Then, after the loop, they pop the last two elements. Finally, they take an input n and print the (n-1)th element of li.\n\nWait, but the problem says the first program reads input. The first Python file does have an input() at the end, so that's the first one's input. The second and third files also have input methods, but according to the problem, only the first should read input and the last should output. So the C program must handle the input once at the start and output once at the end.\n\nHmm, but the second Python file (File 2) is expecting to read a number a, and output 1 if a is 0 else 0. But in the sequence, the output of File 1 is the input to File 2. Wait, no, the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but the first Python file's output is the nth element of the list. The second program (File 2) takes an input a, which would be that number. Then the second program's output is either 1 or 0, which is then the input to the third program. The third program checks if the input (a string) contains 'A' and 'B', but since the input here is a number from the second's output (0 or 1), that would be \"0\" or \"1\", so the third would output \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe I need to track the data flow correctly. Let me think again.\n\nThe first program's output is the nth element (where n is the input to the first program). The second program takes that output as its input a, and outputs 1 if a is 0 else 0. Then the third program takes that output (either 0 or 1 as a string) and checks if it contains 'A' and 'B', which it won't, so it would output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third program's input is the output of the second. The second's output is either 0 or 1, so the third's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\", so the result is \"No\".\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated into a single C program. So the C program must process the input through all three steps without I/O in between.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n) from the user (as per first Python file's input).\n2. Compute the list 'li' as in File 1, then get the nth element (li[n-1]).\n3. Take that value, pass it to the second step (File 2's logic): if it's 0, output 1 else 0.\n4. Take that result (0 or 1), pass to the third step (File 3's logic): check if the string contains 'A' and 'B', which it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third step's input is the output of the second step. The second step's output is either 0 or 1, so the third step's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\", so the third step's result is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire sequence would be \"No\" unless the second step's output is a string containing both 'A' and 'B', which it can't be. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the data flow here. Let me re-express each step's input and output.\n\nFirst program's input is n (from user). Its output is li[n-1], which is an integer (since li is a list of numbers and digits). So the second program's input is that integer. The second program reads it as a, so a is that integer. Then the second program outputs 1 if a is 0 else 0. So the second's output is an integer (0 or 1). The third program takes that as input (as a string, since input() in Python reads a string). So the third program's input is \"0\" or \"1\", so the check for 'A' and 'B' would fail, so output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire sequence is \"No\" unless the second step's output is a string that contains both 'A' and 'B', which it can't be. Wait, but maybe the second step's output is written as a string, so the third program's input is that string. So the third program's input is either \"1\" or \"0\", so the result is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire C program's final output will be \"No\" unless the second step's output is a string with both 'A' and 'B', which it can't be. So the final output is always \"No\" except when the second step's output is something like \"AB\", but that's impossible here.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me retrace:\n\nFirst program's output is an integer (the nth element of li). Let's say that integer is, say, 5. Then the second program takes that 5 as input, so a=5, so the second program outputs 0. Then the third program takes \"0\" as input, so the result is \"No\".\n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the second outputs 1, so third's input is \"1\", so still \"No\".\n\nOnly if the second's output is a string containing both 'A' and 'B' would the third output \"Yes\", but since the second's output is either 0 or 1, that's impossible. So the final output is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output could be a digit that when converted to a string in the second step's output, but no, the second step's output is 1 or 0, which are numbers, but in Python, when you print them, they become strings. So the second program's output is the string \"1\" or \"0\", so the third program's input is that string. So indeed, the third will always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but perhaps I need to make sure that the data flows correctly in the C program. Let me think about how to structure the C code.\n\nThe C program must read the initial input (n from the user), then compute the first step's result (the nth element of li), then process that through the second step (outputting 1 or 0), then process that through the third step (checking for A and B in the string, which will be \"0\" or \"1\", so output \"No\").\n\nTherefore, the C program's steps are:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the list 'li' as per the first Python file.\n\n   Let me think about how to compute 'li' in C. The first file's code builds a list by iterating from 1 to 370. For each i:\n\n   - count the digits (count). If count is 1, add i to li.\n\n   - if count is 2 or 3, split the digits into a temp array, reverse them, and add to li.\n\n   Then, after the loop, pop the last two elements.\n\n   So in C, I need to create an array (or a dynamic array) to hold the elements of li. Let's see how big li can be.\n\n   Let's see for each i from 1 to 370:\n\n   For 1-digit numbers (1-9): each adds 1 element. So 9 elements.\n\n   For 2-digit numbers (10-99): each adds 2 elements (digits reversed). So 90 numbers, each contributing 2 elements \u2192 180 elements.\n\n   For 3-digit numbers (100-370): each adds 3 elements (digits reversed). 370-99 = 271 numbers (since 100 to 370 is 271 numbers?), but wait 370-100+1 = 271. Each contributes 3 elements \u2192 271 *3 = 813 elements.\n\n   So total elements before popping: 9 + 180 + 813 = 9+180 is 189, plus 813 is 1002. Then subtract 2 \u2192 1000 elements? Wait, but let me check:\n\nWait, 1-digit numbers: 1-9 \u2192 9 numbers \u2192 9 elements.\n\n2-digit: 10-99 \u2192 90 numbers \u2192 each contributes 2 digits \u2192 90*2=180 \u2192 total so far 189.\n\n3-digit: 100-370 \u2192 370-100+1 = 271 numbers \u2192 each contributes 3 digits \u2192 271*3 = 813 \u2192 total 189+813=1002. Then after popping two elements, it's 1000 elements. So the list has 1000 elements. So the index n-1 can be up to 999 (since n is input, but the first program's input is n, which is read as an integer. The first program's print statement is li[n-1], so n must be between 1 and 1000 (since after popping two, the length is 1000). So the C code must precompute this list.\n\nTherefore, in C, I can precompute the array li as a static array of 1000 elements. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFirst, let's code the first part in C:\n\nInitialize an array li of size 1000 (since after popping two, it's 1000 elements). But how to build it?\n\nAlternatively, since the list is built step by step, perhaps we can compute it in a loop, appending elements as per the rules.\n\nWait, in C, arrays are fixed size, so perhaps we can precompute the list in a dynamic way. Let's think of the steps:\n\nInitialize an array with enough space. Let's see, the maximum possible before popping is 1002 elements, so an array of 1002 elements. Then after building, we can take the first 1000 elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the elements step by step, and track the current length.\n\nLet me outline the steps for building the list in C:\n\nInitialize an array, say, li[1002], and a variable len =0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 370:\n\n   count = number of digits in i.\n\n   if count ==1:\n\n       li[len++] = i;\n\n   else if count ==2 or 3:\n\n       temp array to hold digits. Let's see, for 3 digits, need 3 elements.\n\n       So create a temporary array of size 3 (since max digits is 3).\n\n       Then, split the digits into temp, then reverse them and add to li.\n\n       For example, for i=123:\n\n           temp[0] = 3, temp[1] = 2, temp[2] =1 (since mod 10 gives 3, then 12 mod 10 is 2, then 1 mod 10 is 1, but wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the code in Python for count 2 or 3:\n\ntemp is initialized as empty list. Then while q !=0:\n\n   x = q%10 \u2192 that's the last digit.\n\n   q = q//10 \u2192 removes the last digit.\n\n   temp.append(x). So the digits are collected in reverse order. Wait, let's see:\n\nTake i=123:\n\nq starts as 123.\n\nFirst iteration: x = 123%10 \u21923, q becomes 12. temp appends 3.\n\nSecond iteration: x=12%10 \u21922, q becomes 1. append 2.\n\nThird iteration: x=1%10 \u21921, q becomes 0. append 1.\n\nSo temp is [3,2,1]. Then when they do temp[::-1], which reverses it again \u2192 [1,2,3]. Wait, no, wait the code says li += temp[::-1].\n\nWait, in the Python code for count 2 or 3:\n\ntemp is filled with the digits in the order of the last digit first. So for 123, temp is [3,2,1]. Then reversed (since [::-1] is reverse), so becomes [1,2,3]. So the digits are added in the original order. Wait, no, the code is temp[::-1], which reverses the list. So for 123, the temp is [3,2,1], reversed becomes [1,2,3], so the digits are added in the original order. So the code is effectively taking the digits in the original order.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose i is 23 (count=2). Then q is 23.\n\nFirst iteration: x=3, q becomes 2 \u2192 temp has [3].\n\nSecond iteration: x=2, q becomes 0 \u2192 temp becomes [3,2].\n\nThen temp[::-1] is [2,3]. So adding that to li. So the digits are added in the original order (23 \u2192 2 and 3? Wait, no, 23's digits are 2 and 3, so the reversed temp would be [2,3], so adding 2 and 3. So the digits are added in the original order. So the code is effectively taking the digits of the number and appending them in the original order. Wait, because the temp is built as the digits from right to left, then reversed, so the order is correct.\n\nWait, for 23:\n\nThe digits are 2 and 3. The code's temp is [3,2], then reversed gives [2,3], so adding 2 and 3. So the digits are added in the original order. So the code is effectively appending the digits of the number in their original order.\n\nWait, so for a 2-digit number like 12, the digits are 1 and 2. The code would collect [2,1], then reverse to [1,2], so adding 1 and 2. So the digits are added in the original order. So the code is appending the digits of the number in their original order.\n\nTherefore, for any number with 2 or 3 digits, the code appends each digit in the original order. So for 123, it appends 1,2,3. For 45, appends 4,5.\n\nTherefore, in C, for each i:\n\n- if count is 1 \u2192 add the number itself.\n\n- else (count 2 or 3):\n\n   split the digits into an array, then add them in the original order (so the first digit is the first element of the array, etc.)\n\nWait, but how to split the digits in C?\n\nLet me think of the steps for a given i:\n\nTo get the digits in the original order, perhaps we can first collect them in reverse order (like the Python code does), then reverse them again before adding to the list.\n\nAlternatively, collect them in the correct order.\n\nHmm, perhaps the easiest way is to collect the digits in reverse order (like the Python code does), then reverse the array before adding to li.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the temp is built as the digits from right to left (since mod 10 gives the last digit first), then reversed (temp[::-1]) to get the original order. So in C, for a given i, we can:\n\n- collect the digits in a temporary array in reverse order (like the Python code's temp).\n\n- then reverse that array to get the correct order, then add each element to li.\n\nAlternatively, collect them in the correct order by first finding the first digit.\n\nAlternatively, let's code it step by step.\n\nFor a given i, to get the digits in the original order:\n\nWe can first compute the number of digits (count), then divide by 10^(count-1) to get the first digit, then mod 10^(count-1) to get the remaining number, etc. But that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, collect the digits in reverse order, then reverse them.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nSo for a given i:\n\nInitialize a temporary array, say temp[3], since max digits is 3.\n\nInitialize a variable temp_len =0.\n\nThen, while i>0:\n\n   digit = i%10 \u2192 this is the last digit.\n\n   temp[temp_len++] = digit.\n\n   i = i /10.\n\nSo after this, the digits are stored in temp in reverse order (e.g., 123 \u2192 temp has 3,2,1).\n\nThen, to get them in the correct order, we can reverse the temp array. So for temp_len elements, we can loop from temp_len-1 down to 0, and add each digit to the li array.\n\nWait, but in C, since arrays are fixed, perhaps we can do this:\n\nAfter collecting the digits in temp (in reverse order), then for j from 0 to temp_len-1, we can add temp[temp_len-1 -j] to the li array.\n\nAlternatively, we can reverse the temp array in place.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose temp has [3,2,1], temp_len=3.\n\nTo reverse it, we can swap first and last elements, then second and second last, etc.\n\nBut for the purpose of adding to li, perhaps it's easier to loop from the end to the beginning.\n\nSo for each digit in the reversed order (original order), we can add them to li.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor (int j = temp_len -1; j >=0; j--){\n\n    li[len++] = temp[j];\n\n}\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the temp array has the digits in reverse order (like 3,2,1 for 123). To get the original order (1,2,3), we need to take the elements in reverse order of the temp array. Wait, no, the temp array is [3,2,1], so to get 1,2,3, we need to take the elements in reverse order of the temp array. Wait, no, the temp array is [3,2,1], so to get the original digits (123 \u2192 1,2,3), we need to take the elements in reverse order of the temp array. Wait, the first digit is 1 (the original first digit is 1?), no, 123's first digit is 1, then 2, then 3. Wait, no, 123 is 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 3 (units). So the digits in order are 1,2,3. The temp array is [3,2,1], so to get the original order, we need to reverse the temp array. So the correct digits are temp[2], temp[1], temp[0].\n\nTherefore, to add them in the correct order, we can loop from the end of the temp array to the start, and add each digit to li.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor (int j = temp_len -1; j >=0; j--){\n\n    li[len] = temp[j];\n\n    len++;\n\n}\n\nSo that's how to handle the digits for count 2 or 3.\n\nNow, the steps for building the li array in C:\n\nInitialize an array li of size 1002 (since before popping two elements, it's 1002 elements). Then after building, we can take the first 1000 elements.\n\nWait, but in C, arrays are fixed, so perhaps we can precompute the list.\n\nAlternatively, let's code it step by step.\n\nInitialize li as an array of size 1002, and a variable len =0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 370:\n\n   count = number of digits in i.\n\n   To compute count:\n\n   int count =0;\n\n   int temp_i = i;\n\n   while (temp_i >0){\n\n       temp_i /=10;\n\n       count++;\n\n   }\n\n   if (count ==1){\n\n       li[len++] = i;\n\n   } else if (count ==2 || count ==3){\n\n       // collect digits in temp array.\n\n       int temp[4]; // since max digits is 3, but 4 to be safe.\n\n       int temp_len =0;\n\n       int num = i;\n\n       while (num>0){\n\n           int digit = num%10;\n\n           temp[temp_len++] = digit;\n\n           num /=10;\n\n       }\n\n       // now add them in reverse order (original order)\n\n       for (int j = temp_len-1; j >=0; j--){\n\n           li[len++] = temp[j];\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nAfter the loop, we need to pop the last two elements. Since in Python, li.pop() removes the last element. So after building, the array has len elements (which is 1002). So we need to set len to 1000, and then the array up to len is the final li.\n\nWait, in the code above, after the loop, len is 1002. So after the loop, we can set len = len -2 (so 1000). But the array remains as is, but we just consider the first 1000 elements.\n\nSo after building the array, the final li is the first 1000 elements.\n\nOnce that's done, the first step's result is li[n-1], where n is the input from the user.\n\nWait, but in the first Python file, the input is n = int(input('')), and then print(li[n-1]).\n\nSo in the C program, the first step is to read n from the user, then compute the value at index n-1 (since arrays are 0-based in C).\n\nSo after building the li array, the first step's output is li[n-1].\n\nThen, the second step (File 2's logic) takes that value as 'a', and outputs 1 if a is 0 else 0.\n\nWait, in the second Python file, the code is:\n\ndef solve(tc):\n\n    a = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    print(1 if a ==0 else 0)\n\nSo the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is an integer. So in the C program, the second step is to take the first step's result (the value from li[n-1]), and compute the second step's output as (a ==0 ? 1 :0).\n\nThen, the third step (File 3's logic) takes that second step's output (which is either 0 or 1) as input, and checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the input is a number (0 or 1), the string is \"0\" or \"1\", so the result is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the third step's output is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but in the third Python file, the code is:\n\nstdin = input()\n\ns = stdin\n\nresult = \"Yes\" if \"A\" in s and \"B\" in s else \"No\"\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo the input is the output of the second step, which is either \"0\" or \"1\", so s is \"0\" or \"1\", so the result is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire sequence is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the second step's output is a number. But in the second step's code, the output is printed as 1 or 0, which in Python is a string when printed. So the third program's input is that string (either \"1\" or \"0\"), so the check for 'A' and 'B' is false.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nHmm, so the entire C program's final output is \"No\" regardless of the input n (as long as it's valid for the first step). But I need to make sure that the code correctly follows all steps.\n\nNow, putting this all together into a C program.\n\nThe steps in C:\n\n1. Read the input n from stdin.\n\n2. Precompute the li array as described.\n\n3. Get the value from li[n-1].\n\n4. Compute the second step's result (1 if value is 0 else 0).\n\n5. The third step's input is the string representation of that result (either \"0\" or \"1\"), so the output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but in the third step, the input is the output of the second step. The second step's output is an integer (0 or 1), but when printed, it's a string. So the third step's input is that string. So in C, the third step's input is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nTherefore, the third step's code in C would check if the string contains 'A' and 'B', which it doesn't, so output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but what if the second step's output is 0, then the third step's input is \"0\", so the result is \"No\".\n\nSame for 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program can be written as follows:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute the first step's value (li[n-1]).\n\n- Compute second step's value (1 if first_val is 0 else 0).\n\n- The third step's input is the string of second_val, so check if it contains 'A' and 'B' \u2192 no.\n\n- So the final output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third step's code in the original Python is:\n\nresult = \"Yes\" if \"A\" in s and \"B\" in s else \"No\"\n\nSo the third step's output is \"No\" unless the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the C program can just output \"No\" regardless of the input, but that's only if the steps are followed correctly.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first step's calculation. Let me confirm.\n\nSuppose the first step's output is 0, then the second step outputs 1, so third's input is \"1\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nIf first step's output is 5, second outputs 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nIf first step's output is 0, second outputs 1 \u2192 third's input is \"1\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nOnly if the second step's output is a string containing both 'A' and 'B' would it be \"Yes\", but since the second step's output is 0 or 1, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but what if the second step's output is a string like \"AB\"? That can't happen here.\n\nTherefore, the C program can be written to always output \"No\".\n\nBut that seems too simple. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first program's code.\n\nThe first program's list 'li' is built as follows:\n\nFor numbers 1-370:\n\n- 1-digit numbers (1-9) are added as themselves.\n\n- 2-digit numbers (10-99) are split into their digits and added in order. For example, 10 \u2192 digits 1 and 0 \u2192 added as 1,0.\n\nWait, let's take an example:\n\nTake i=10:\n\ncount is 2 digits.\n\ntemp is built as [0,1] (since 10 mod10 is 0, then 1 mod10 is 1, then 0 \u2192 loop stops. So temp is [0,1], then reversed (temp[::-1] is [1,0], so added to li as 1 and 0.\n\nWait, in the code, for count 2 or 3, the code does li += temp[::-1], which is the reversed temp array. Wait, in the Python code:\n\ntemp is filled with the digits in the order of the last digit first. So for 10, temp is [0,1], then reversed gives [1,0], so the digits are added as 1 and 0.\n\nWait, so the digits are added in the original order (the first digit first). So for 10, the digits are 1 and 0 \u2192 added as 1,0.\n\nWait, but the number 10's digits are 1 and 0, so the code is adding them in the correct order.\n\nAnother example: i=123 (count=3):\n\ntemp is [3,2,1], reversed gives [1,2,3], so added as 1,2,3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the first program's list 'li' is built correctly.\n\nNow, the first program's output is li[n-1], which is an integer. The second program takes that integer as input, and outputs 1 if it's 0 else 0.\n\nSo the second step's output is 1 only if the first step's output is 0.\n\nNow, when would the first step's output be 0?\n\nLooking at the list 'li':\n\nThe list is built by adding numbers and digits. Let's see if 0 is present in the list.\n\nThe first part of the list (1-digit numbers) are 1-9, so 0 is not there.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers, like 10: the digits are 1 and 0 \u2192 so 0 is added to the list.\n\nAh! So for example, the number 10 contributes 1 and 0 to the list. So 0 is present in the list.\n\nTherefore, if the user's input n is such that li[n-1] is 0, then the second step's output is 1, and the third step's input is \"1\", so the third step outputs \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third step's input is the second step's output, which is 1 \u2192 \"1\", so the third step's result is \"No\".\n\nWait, but if the second step's output is 1, then the third step's input is \"1\", so the check for 'A' and 'B' is false \u2192 \"No\".\n\nOnly if the second step's output is a string that contains both 'A' and 'B' would it be \"Yes\", but since the second step's output is either 0 or 1, the third step's input is \"0\" or \"1\", so the result is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire C program can be written to read the input n, compute the first step's value, then compute the second step's value (0 or 1), then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the C program must behave identically to the original chain. So even if the final output is always \"No\", the code must go through all steps.\n\nTherefore, the code must compute everything, but the final output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the C program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nCompute the first step's value (li[n-1]).\n\nCompute second_val = (first_val ==0) ? 1 :0;\n\nThen, the third step's input is the string representation of second_val (either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nCheck if the string contains both 'A' and 'B' \u2192 no.\n\nSo output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the code can be written to always output \"No\".\n\nBut perhaps I should code it properly, even if the result is always \"No\".\n\nNow, let's proceed to code this.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    // Read n from input.\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Precompute the li array.\n\n    int li[1000]; // since after popping two elements, it's 1000 elements.\n\n    // Need to build the array correctly.\n\n    // Let's build it step by step.\n\n    int len =0;\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=370; i++) {\n\n        int count =0;\n\n        int temp_i =i;\n\n        while (temp_i>0) {\n\n            temp_i /=10;\n\n            count++;\n\n        }\n\n        if (count ==1) {\n\n            li[len++] =i;\n\n        } else if (count ==2 || count ==3) {\n\n            int temp[4]; // to hold digits.\n\n            int temp_len=0;\n\n            int num =i;\n\n            while (num>0) {\n\n                int digit = num%10;\n\n                temp[temp_len++] = digit;\n\n                num /=10;\n\n            }\n\n            // Now add them in reverse order (original order)\n\n            for (int j = temp_len-1; j >=0; j--) {\n\n                li[len] = temp[j];\n\n                len++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // After the loop, len is 1002. Need to subtract 2.\n\n    len -=2;\n\n    // Now, the array li has 1000 elements, indices 0 to 999.\n\n    // Get the value at n-1.\n\n    int first_val = li[n-1];\n\n    // Second step: compute second_val.\n\n    int second_val = (first_val ==0) ? 1 :0;\n\n    // Third step: check if the string of second_val contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\n    // Since it's either \"0\" or \"1\", the result is \"No\".\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, after building the array, the len is initially 1002 (since the loop runs for i up to 370, and the code builds the array as per the first step). Then, after the loop, we set len -=2, so len is 1000. But the array is still of size 1000, so the elements from 0 to 999 are the correct ones.\n\nWait, but in the code, the li array is declared as size 1000. But during the loop, when count is 2 or 3, we add temp_len elements (2 or 3 digits). So the total elements before popping would be 1002, but the array is only 1000 elements. That's a problem.\n\nAh, right! The array is declared as 1000 elements, but during the loop, we might be writing beyond that.\n\nWait, the initial code in C:\n\nint li[1000]; // size 1000.\n\nBut during the loop, the code may write up to 1002 elements (since before popping, it's 1002 elements). So the array is too small.\n\nTherefore, the array must be declared as 1002 elements, then after the loop, we can ignore the last two elements.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nint li[1002]; // enough to hold all elements before popping.\n\nThen, after the loop, len is 1002. Then, we set len = 1000, but the array is still 1002 elements. But when accessing li[n-1], n can be up to 1000 (since after popping, the list has 1000 elements). So the indices 0 to 999 are valid.\n\nTherefore, the code should be adjusted:\n\nint li[1002]; // size 1002.\n\nThen, after the loop, len is 1002. Then, we set len = len -2 (so 1000), but the array is still okay.\n\nThe first_val is li[n-1], which is within 0 to 999 (since n is up to 1000).\n\nTherefore, the corrected code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int li[1002]; // enough to hold all elements before popping.\n\n    int len =0;\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=370; i++) {\n\n        int count =0;\n\n        int temp_i =i;\n\n        while (temp_i>0) {\n\n            temp_i /=10;\n\n            count++;\n\n        }\n\n        if (count ==1) {\n\n            li[len++] =i;\n\n        } else if (count ==2 || count ==3) {\n\n            int temp[4]; // to hold digits.\n\n            int temp_len=0;\n\n            int num =i;\n\n            while (num>0) {\n\n                int digit = num%10;\n\n                temp[temp_len++] = digit;\n\n                num /=10;\n\n            }\n\n            // Now add them in reverse order (original order)\n\n            for (int j = temp_len-1; j >=0; j--) {\n\n                li[len] = temp[j];\n\n                len++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // After the loop, len is 1002. Need to subtract 2.\n\n    len -=2;\n\n    // Now, the array li has 1000 elements, indices 0 to 999.\n\n    // Get the value at n-1.\n\n    int first_val = li[n-1];\n\n    int second_val = (first_val ==0) ? 1 :0;\n\n    // Third step: check if the string of second_val contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\n    // Since it's either \"0\" or \"1\", the result is \"No\".\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but what if the user inputs n=0? But according to the first Python program, n is read as an integer, and the print statement is li[n-1]. So n must be between 1 and 1000 (since after popping, the list has 1000 elements). The code should handle that, but the problem says to translate the sequence, so we can assume valid input.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose n is 1000.\n\nThe first_val is li[999], which is the last element of the list after popping.\n\nThe list after popping has 1000 elements. The last element would be the 1000th element (index 999).\n\nBut what is that element?\n\nWell, the last elements before popping were the last two elements of the original list (which were part of the 370th number's digits).\n\nBut regardless, the second step's output is either 0 or 1, leading to \"No\".\n\nAnother test case: suppose the first_val is 0.\n\nThen second_val is 1 \u2192 third step's input is \"1\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: first_val is 5 \u2192 second_val is 0 \u2192 third step's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final C program is as above."
