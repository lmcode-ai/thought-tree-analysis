Then calculates the initial answer as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R. Then loops over i from 1 to n, computes energy for each i, and updates the answer if it's smaller. In C, I need to read these variables. The W array can be stored in an array. The sum_el is an array of size n+1, with sum_el[0] =0, and each next element is sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1]. Then compute the initial answer, loop through each i, compute energy, and track the minimum. Second part:\n\nThe second Python code takes N (from first's output) and defines a recursive function aaa(n) that counts numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits, not exceeding N. The function uses memoization? Or just recursive calls. The base case is if the number exceeds N, return 0. Otherwise, check if all digits are 3,5,7 (but actually, the way it's written, the function checks if the current number's digits are all in {'3','5','7'}, but since it's built by appending those digits, maybe that check is redundant? Wait, the code says:\n\nans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n\nWait, but the function is called with n starting as '0', then adding '7', '5', '3' each time.

So I need to loop over an array. So modifying the code:\n\nint digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    int d = digits[i];\n\n    ans += aaa(current*10 +d, N);\n\n} Thus, the function becomes:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int valid =1;\n    if (current ==0) valid=0;\n    else {\n        int temp = current;\n        while (temp >0) {\n            int digit = temp%10; if (digit !=3 && digit ! =5 && digit ! =7) {\n                valid =0;\n                break;\n            }\n            temp /=10;\n        }\n    }\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n    int digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        ans += aaa(current*10 + digits[i], N);\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nThis should work.

But in C, recursion with large numbers may hit stack limits, but since the depth is logarithmic in N, it's manageable. Thus, the second part's variables must be adjusted. So, modifying the second part's function:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) \u2192 becomes:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    // ... \n\n    // the valid check remains the same.\n\n    // the digits are still 3,5,7.\n\n    // the return value is the count, which can be up to the number of valid numbers up to N.\n\n    // which for N up to 1e18 is manageable as a long long.\n\n} Wait, but the count can be up to the number of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N. For N=1e18, the count is the number of such numbers with up to 18 digits, which is 3^18 \u2248 3.8e8, which fits in a long long. Thus, the function's return type should be long long. Thus, the function signature is:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    // ...\n\n} In main:\n\nlong long N = answer; // since answer is a long long. long long count = aaa(0, N); Thus, the second part's code must be adjusted.

Alternatively, in the recursive call:\n\nlong long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\nif (next > N) continue;\n\nans += aaa(next, N); But this requires computing next first and checking. Thus, modifying the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    long long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\n    if (next > N) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    ans += aaa(next, N);\n\n}\n\nThis way, we avoid overflow in the multiplication, because if current is already large enough that current*10 exceeds N, then next would be larger than N, so the function returns 0 anyway. Thus, this is a safer approach. Thus, the code for the loop becomes:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    long long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\n    if (next > N) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    ans += aaa(next, N);\n\n} This prevents overflow in the multiplication step. Thus, the function is now safe. Now, the code for the second part's function is fixed. Now, the code for the second part's count is:\n\nlong long count = aaa(0, N); Thus, the third part's target is count, which is a long long. The third part's code uses l array of long long, so the comparisons are okay.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding each part and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Python file reads input, processes some calculations, and outputs an answer. The second file reads another input (N) and calculates something with a recursive function. The third file generates a list of numbers and finds the smallest one >= input n. But since they are supposed to be executed in sequence, the output of each is the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the code, the first file's output is the answer from the first part, which would be the input to the second file? Or maybe the second file's input is from the first's output? Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the first file's first line is input().split() which reads n, L, R, QL, QR. Then the next line reads W. The output is the answer variable printed. The second file starts with N = int(input()), so the input to the second file is the output of the first. Then the second's output is the result of the aaa function, which is then the input to the third file. The third file's first input is n, which comes from the second's output. The third's output is the answer, which is the final output of the entire sequence.\n\nSo the overall flow is: first program's input is the user's initial input, then its output is the input to the second, whose output is input to the third, and the third's output is the final result.\n\nBut in the C program, I need to combine all three into one, so that the first part's output is passed to the second part's input, and so on, without any I/O in between. So the C program must read the initial input, process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nHmm, but how do the outputs of each Python file connect? Let me see:\n\nFirst Python file's output is the 'answer' variable, which is printed. The second Python file takes that as N. Then the second's output is the return value of aaa('0'), which is printed. The third takes that as n, and outputs the minimal number >= that n from the list l.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input for the first part (n, L, R, QL, QR and the W array).\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the minimum energy).\n\n3. Use that answer as the N for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result (the count of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N).\n\n5. Use that result as the n for the third part.\n\n6. Compute the third part's answer (the minimal number in the generated list >= that n).\n\n7. Output that final answer.\n\nSo the C program must process all three steps in sequence, passing data between them in memory, not via I/O.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nThe first Python code:\n\nReads n, L, R, QL, QR from input. Then reads W as a list of integers. Then computes sum_el as a prefix sum array. Then calculates the initial answer as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R. Then loops over i from 1 to n, computes energy for each i, and updates the answer if it's smaller.\n\nIn C, I need to read these variables. The W array can be stored in an array. The sum_el is an array of size n+1, with sum_el[0] =0, and each next element is sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1].\n\nThen compute the initial answer, loop through each i, compute energy, and track the minimum.\n\nSecond part:\n\nThe second Python code takes N (from first's output) and defines a recursive function aaa(n) that counts numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits, not exceeding N. The function uses memoization? Or just recursive calls. The base case is if the number exceeds N, return 0. Otherwise, check if all digits are 3,5,7 (but actually, the way it's written, the function checks if the current number's digits are all in {'3','5','7'}, but since it's built by appending those digits, maybe that check is redundant? Wait, the code says:\n\nans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n\nWait, but the function is called with n starting as '0', then adding '7', '5', '3' each time. So the numbers are built by appending digits, so all digits are 3,5,7. So the check is redundant? Because any number generated by the function's recursive calls would only have those digits. Hmm, but maybe the initial '0' is a problem. Wait, the function starts with '0', then adds digits. So the first call is aaa('0'), which appends 7,5,3, making 7,5,3. Then each subsequent call adds digits. So the numbers are all made of 3,5,7. So the check is redundant. But the code includes it, so perhaps the code is written that way to handle cases where the number might have other digits? Not sure, but in the code's logic, the check is there. So in C, I need to replicate that.\n\nBut in C, recursion might be tricky for large N. Wait, the first part's output is the answer from the first code, which could be a large number. But the second code's N is that answer. The second code's function is recursive, but for numbers up to N. However, the first code's answer could be up to, say, (QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R) which could be big, but the second code's function counts numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N. The maximum possible N here could be very large, but the recursion depth might be an issue. Wait, but in the Python code, the function is called with n starting as '0', then adding digits. Each step appends a digit, so the number grows exponentially. So for N up to 1e18, the recursion depth would be up to 18, which is manageable. So in C, recursion is okay.\n\nBut in C, handling the digits as strings might be a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the count without recursion, but the code uses a recursive approach. Let's see.\n\nThe function aaa(n) is called with a string (since it starts with '0'), but in the code, n is converted to an integer. Wait, the function's parameter is n, which is passed as a string initially. The first line is:\n\nif int(n) > N: return 0\n\nSo the function is called with strings, but converted to integers for comparison. The function builds numbers by appending '7', '5', '3' to the current n (as a string), then converts to integer. Hmm, but in C, perhaps it's better to track the current number as an integer, and pass it along. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in C, the function can take an integer current number, and track whether all digits are 3,5,7. Wait, but since the function builds numbers by appending digits, all digits are 3,5,7, so the check is redundant. So the code's check is redundant, but perhaps the code is written that way to handle cases where the number might have other digits. But in the recursive calls, since we only append 3,5,7, the numbers are always valid. So the check can be skipped. But to be precise, the code's logic must be followed exactly. So in C, when building the number, we can skip the check, but perhaps the code's logic requires it. Wait, the code's ans is 1 if the set of the digits is exactly {'3','5','7'}, but since the digits are built by appending those digits, the set can't have anything else. So the check is redundant. So perhaps the code is written that way to ensure that the number is made of exactly those digits, but in the recursive approach, it's guaranteed. So in C, perhaps we can omit that check, but to be safe, maybe we should include it.\n\nHmm, but in the code, the initial call is aaa('0'), which is 0. The first check is if 0 > N? Probably not, so then the code checks if the digits of 0 (which is '0') are all in the set. Since '0' is not in the set, the ans is 0. But then the loop adds 7,5,3 to 0, making 7,5,3. So the initial 0 is not counted, but the children are. So the code's first call returns 0, but the loop adds the children. So the code's logic is okay.\n\nIn C, perhaps the function can be written with parameters as the current number, and the count. Let me think of a way to implement this recursively in C.\n\nAlternatively, since the numbers are built by appending digits, perhaps we can represent the current number as an integer, and track how many digits it has. The function can be written as:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    // check if all digits are 3,5,7. But since we build them, this is redundant.\n\n    // but to replicate the code exactly, perhaps we need to check.\n\n    // To check, we can loop through each digit of current and see if they are 3,5,7.\n\n    // but since current is built by appending those digits, this is redundant.\n\n    // So perhaps the code's check is redundant, but we can skip it.\n\n    // So the code's ans is 1 if the digits are all in the set, else 0.\n\n    // So in C, we can compute that.\n\n    // Let's see: the current number must be composed of 3,5,7 digits.\n\n    // So to check, we can loop through each digit:\n\n    int valid = 1;\n\n    int temp = current;\n\n    if (temp ==0) valid =0; // because 0 is not allowed?\n\n    while (temp >0) {\n\n        int digit = temp%10;\n\n        if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n\n            valid =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n        temp /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n\n    // then add the recursive calls for appending 3,5,7.\n\n    for (int d : {3,5,7}) {\n\n        ans += aaa(current *10 +d, N);\n\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the function is called with n as a string, but in the code, the initial call is '0', which becomes 0. So the first call's current is 0, which is invalid (since 0 has a 0 digit). So the ans is 0, but then the loop adds the children (0*10 +3, etc. but 0*10 is 0, so 0+3 is 3, etc. So the first call's ans is 0, but the children are added. So the code's logic is okay.\n\nSo in C, the function can be written recursively as above. But in C, we can't have loops with {3,5,7} easily. So perhaps loop over an array of those digits.\n\nBut recursion in C for this function may be okay, as the depth is logarithmic in N. Since N can be up to the first part's answer, which could be large, but the digits are 3,5,7, so the maximum number of digits is log10(N). For N up to say 1e18, that's 18 digits, so recursion depth is manageable.\n\nSo the second part's function can be implemented recursively in C.\n\nThird part:\n\nThe third Python code generates all numbers with equal number of 4 and 7 digits, starting from 0 (but the function starts with 0, four=0, seven=0, but the initial call is gen(0,0,0). The gen function adds 4 and 7 digits, but only keeps numbers where the count of fours equals sevens. The numbers are generated by appending 4 or 7, tracking counts. The list l is filled with all such numbers <= limit (1e10). Then, given an input n, find the smallest number in l >=n.\n\nIn C, the third part needs to generate all such numbers, store them in a sorted array, then search for the first element >=n.\n\nBut generating all such numbers can be done via a recursive approach as well. Let's see:\n\nThe gen function in Python is a recursive function that builds numbers by appending 4 or 7, keeping track of the counts. The base case is when the number exceeds the limit (1e10). Otherwise, if the current number is positive and four == seven, add to the list. Then recursively call with adding 4 (increment four count) and adding 7 (increment seven count).\n\nIn C, this can be done with a recursive function, but again, the depth is manageable. The maximum number of digits would be up to 10 digits (since limit is 1e10, which is 10^10, so 10 digits). So recursion depth is up to 10, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, an iterative approach with a queue could be used, but recursion is straightforward here.\n\nOnce the list is generated, it's sorted, and then a binary search can be done to find the first element >=n.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read the first part's input: n, L, R, QL, QR, then the W array.\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the minimum energy).\n\n3. Use that answer as N for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result (the count of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N).\n\n5. Use that result as n for the third part.\n\n6. Generate all numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts (the list l), sort them, then find the smallest element >=n.\n\n7. Output that element.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures and steps in C.\n\nFirst part variables:\n\n- n (from input), L, R, QL, QR.\n\n- W array of size n.\n\n- sum_el array of size n+1.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nsum_el[0] =0.\n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\nsum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1]\n\nThen compute initial answer as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\ncompute energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i])\n\nthen check if i > (n -i):\n\nthen add (i - (n-i) -1)*QL.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif i > (n -i):\n\n    energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL\n\nelif (n -i) >i:\n\n    energy += ((n -i) -i -1)*QR\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif i > (n -i):\n\nthen the first case.\n\nElse if (n-i) >i, then the second case.\n\nElse, neither, so no addition.\n\nWait, but when i == (n-i), then neither condition is true, so no addition.\n\nSo the code is adding based on which side is larger.\n\nThe energy is then compared to the current answer, and the minimum is kept.\n\nSo in C, the code for this part is straightforward.\n\nSecond part variables:\n\nThe N is the first part's answer.\n\nThe function aaa needs to return the count of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits, not exceeding N.\n\nImplementing the recursive function in C.\n\nThird part variables:\n\nThe n is the second part's result.\n\nWe need to generate all numbers with equal number of 4 and 7 digits, up to 1e10.\n\nThe list l is generated via the recursive gen function.\n\nOnce generated, sort the list, then find the first element >=n.\n\nNow, in C, the list l can be stored in an array. Since the limit is 1e10, the maximum possible number is 10 digits. The number of such numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts can be calculated.\n\nThe number of digits must be even, since 4 and 7 counts must be equal. So possible lengths are 2,4,... up to 10 digits (since 10 is even). For each even length 2k, the number of numbers is C(2k, k). The total is sum_{k=1 to 5} C(2k, k). Let's compute:\n\nFor 2 digits: C(2,1)=2 (47,74)\n\n4 digits: C(4,2)=6\n\n6 digits: C(6,3)=20\n\n8 digits: C(8,4)=70\n\n10 digits: C(10,5)=252\n\nTotal is 2+6+20+70+252 = 350. So the list l can be stored in an array of size 350.\n\nWait, but the initial call to gen(0,0,0) starts with 0, but the code in Python's gen function:\n\nif (number > limit) return;\n\nif (number >0 and four == seven) append to l.\n\nSo when number is 0, four and seven are both 0, but since number is 0, it's not added. So the first valid numbers are those with equal counts and number>0.\n\nSo the maximum possible elements in l is 350. So in C, we can preallocate an array of size 350, and track the count.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nThe numbers are built by appending 4 or 7 each time. The counts of 4 and 7 must be equal. So for each step, the number of 4's and 7's must be equal. So the length must be even. The first valid number is 47 (counts 1 and 1), 74, etc. So the total numbers are as calculated.\n\nThus, in C, we can have an array of size 350, and a counter. The gen function can be implemented recursively, appending to the array when the condition is met.\n\nOnce the array is filled, we sort it, then perform a binary search for the first element >=n.\n\nNow, putting all together in C:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead the first part's inputs.\n\nCompute first part's answer.\n\nCompute second part's result using that answer as N.\n\nCompute third part's result using the second's result as n.\n\nOutput the third's result.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n, L, R, QL, QR from input. Then read n integers for W.\n\nsum_el array of size n+1.\n\nInitialize sum_el[0] =0.\n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\nsum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1]\n\nCompute initial answer as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\ncompute energy.\n\nThen check the conditions and add the appropriate term.\n\nCompare with current answer and keep the minimum.\n\nSecond part:\n\nImplement the recursive function aaa(int current, int N). Wait, but in the Python code, the function is called with '0', which is treated as an integer. So the initial call is aaa(0). Wait, in the Python code, the first call is aaa('0'), which is converted to 0. So the initial current is 0. But in the code's logic, the first call's current is 0, which is checked against N. If N is 0, then it returns 0. But in the code's first part's answer, which is the N for the second part, could be zero? Probably not, but possible.\n\nWait, the first part's answer is the minimum energy, which could be zero? Let's see:\n\nThe first part's answer is initialized as QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R. Then it loops over i and finds the minimum. So if the initial value is the minimum, then the answer is that. But QR and R could be zero, but the problem probably expects valid inputs. Anyway, the code must handle it.\n\nThe function aaa in C would need to be called with current=0, and N is the first part's answer.\n\nWait, the Python code's function is called with '0', which is converted to 0. So in C, the initial call is aaa(0, N).\n\nThe function aaa would return the count.\n\nThird part:\n\nGenerate the list l via the gen function. The gen function can be implemented recursively, appending to an array.\n\nWait, in C, since arrays are fixed size, we can preallocate an array of size 350, and track the current index. The gen function can be a void function that appends to the array when conditions are met.\n\nWait, but in C, functions can't return arrays, so perhaps we can pass a pointer to the array and a pointer to the current size.\n\nAlternatively, use a global array and a global counter. Since the problem requires no I/O in the middle, and the code is a single C program, using global variables might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, pass parameters by reference.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to have a global array and a global index for the third part's list.\n\nAlternatively, here's the plan for the third part:\n\nInitialize an array l of size 350, and a variable count =0.\n\nCall gen(0,0,0) to fill the array.\n\nThen sort the array, and then search for the first element >=n.\n\nThe gen function:\n\nvoid gen(int number, int four, int seven) {\n\n    if (number > limit) return;\n\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n\n        l[count++] = number;\n\n    }\n\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the initial call is gen(0,0,0). The first call would check number=0, which is not >0, so no addition. Then it calls gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1).\n\nEach subsequent call builds numbers by appending 4 or 7, tracking counts.\n\nThis should work.\n\nOnce the array is filled, we sort it, then perform a binary search.\n\nNow, putting all together in C code.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Constants\n#define LIMIT 10000000000LL // 1e10\n#define MAX_L_SIZE 350\n\n// Variables for third part\nlong long l[MAX_L_SIZE];\nint l_count =0;\n\n// Function for second part\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    // Check if all digits are 3,5,7\n    int valid =1;\n    if (current ==0) valid=0; // since 0 is not allowed (as per the initial check)\n    else {\n        int temp = current;\n        while (temp >0) {\n            int digit = temp%10;\n            if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n                valid =0;\n                break;\n            }\n            temp /=10;\n        }\n    }\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n    for (int d=3; d<=7; d +=2) { // 3,5,7\n        if (d ==5 || d ==3 || d ==7) { // just to include all three\n            ans += aaa(current*10 +d, N);\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\n// Function for third part's gen\nvoid gen(int number, int four, int seven) {\n    if (number > LIMIT) return;\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n        l[l_count++] = number;\n    }\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // First part variables\n    int n, L, R, QL, QR;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n    int W[n];\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &W[i]);\n    }\n    \n    // Compute sum_el\n    int sum_el[n+1];\n    sum_el[0] =0;\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1];\n    }\n    \n    // Compute initial answer\n    int answer = QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R;\n    \n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        int energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n        int diff = i - (n -i);\n        if (diff >0) { // i > (n-i)\n            energy += (diff -1)*QL;\n        } else if (diff <0) { // (n-i) >i\n            energy += ( ( (n -i) -i ) -1 ) * QR;\n        }\n        if (energy < answer) {\n            answer = energy;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Second part: compute N = answer from first part\n    int N = answer;\n    \n    // Compute the second part's result (count)\n    int count = aaa(0, N);\n    \n    // Third part: compute the required value\n    // Initialize the list l\n    l_count =0;\n    gen(0,0,0);\n    \n    // Sort the list\n    qsort(l, l_count, sizeof(long long), compare);\n    // Need to define compare function\n    // Wait, in C, the compare function must be defined before main or as a static.\n    // So let's define it here.\n    int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n        return (*(long long*)a - *(long long*)b);\n    }\n    \n    // Find the first element >= count\n    int target = count;\n    int low =0, high = l_count-1;\n    int res = -1;\n    while (low <= high) {\n        int mid = (low + high)/2;\n        if (l[mid] >= target) {\n            res = l[mid];\n            high = mid -1;\n        } else {\n            low = mid +1;\n        }\n    }\n    // If res is found, output it. Else, since the list is sorted and all elements are up to 1e10, but the target may be larger than all elements? Wait, but the gen function stops when number exceeds LIMIT (1e10). So if the target exceeds the maximum element (which is up to 7777777777 (10 digits of 7 and 4?), then the code would not have any element >= target. But according to the problem's third Python code, the code loops through l and sets ans to val when val >=n, and breaks. So if no such element exists, it would not set ans, but the code in Python's third part's main function:\n\n    // In the Python code's main function:\n    ans =0\n    for val in l:\n        if val >=n:\n            ans = val\n            break\n    print(ans)\n\n    So if no element is found, ans remains 0? But according to the code, the list l is generated with numbers up to 1e10. So if the target is larger than the maximum element (which is 7777777777 (10 digits with 5 4s and 5 7s?), then the code would output 0? But that's not correct. Wait, the Python code's loop starts with ans=0, and if no val is found, it remains 0. But according to the problem's third code, the input n is given, and the code must output the minimal number in l >=n. If none exists, then perhaps the code would output nothing? But the problem says the third code's output is printed, so in that case, it would print 0. But according to the problem's third code's code, the loop breaks when it finds the first val >=n, so if none, ans remains 0, which is printed. So in C, we need to handle that.\n\nWait, in the C code's binary search, if no element is found (i.e., all elements are less than target), then the loop would set res to -1, but in the code above, res is initialized to -1. So after the loop, if res is -1, then the answer is the last element? Or no?\n\nWait, the binary search code I wrote is trying to find the first element >= target. Let me think again.\n\nThe code:\n\nInitialize res =-1.\n\nLoop:\n\nif l[mid] >= target: then possible candidate, so set res to l[mid], and search left for smaller elements.\n\nElse, search right.\n\nWait, this approach may not work correctly. Let me think of a better way.\n\nAlternatively, find the first index where l[mid] >= target, then the answer is l[index].\n\nAlternatively, use binary search to find the first occurrence >= target.\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\nInitialize low=0, high = l_count-1.\n\nresult = -1.\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    mid = (low+high)/2;\n\n    if (l[mid] >= target) {\n\n        result = mid;\n\n        high = mid-1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        low = mid+1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIf result is found (i.e., result != -1), then the answer is l[result]. Else, no element found, so output 0.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, the list l is sorted, so if the first element is >= target, then that's the answer. If all elements are less than target, then the answer is 0 (since the code in Python's third part would not find any and ans remains 0).\n\nThus, in C:\n\nAfter sorting l, perform the binary search as above.\n\nIf result is found (i.e., low <= high and ...), then the answer is l[result].\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop sets res to l[mid], but perhaps I should track the index instead of the value.\n\nLet me rework the binary search part.\n\nInitialize low =0, high = l_count-1.\n\nint index = -1;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    int mid = (low + high)/2;\n\n    if (l[mid] >= target) {\n\n        index = mid;\n\n        high = mid -1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        low = mid +1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (index != -1) {\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", l[index]);\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the loop is:\n\nans =0\n\nfor val in l:\n\n    if val >=n:\n\n        ans = val\n\n        break\n\nSo if the list is empty (unlikely here), ans remains 0. But in our case, the list l is filled with numbers generated by the gen function. The first valid number is 47, 74, etc. So if the target is 0, then the first element (47) would be >=0, so ans is 47. But if target is 1e11, then no elements, so ans is 0.\n\nThus, in C, the code should output 0 if no element is found.\n\nThus, the code for the third part:\n\nAfter sorting l:\n\nint index = -1;\n\nint low =0, high = l_count-1;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    int mid = (low + high)/2;\n\n    if (l[mid] >= target) {\n\n        index = mid;\n\n        high = mid-1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        low = mid+1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (index != -1) {\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", l[index]);\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n}\n\nBut in the code above, the target is count (the second part's result). Wait, the third part's input n is the second part's result, which is count. So target is count.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nWait, but in the second part's function aaa, the parameters are current and N. The initial call is aaa(0, N). But in the code above, the function is written as aaa(int current, int N). So in main, after computing N = answer, we call:\n\nint count = aaa(0, N);\n\nBut in C, the function aaa is recursive. However, for large N, the recursion depth could be up to the number of digits. For example, if N is 1e18, the digits are 18, so the recursion depth is 18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the compare function for qsort must be defined before main, or as a static function.\n\nWait, in C, the compare function must be a separate function. So I'll define it before main.\n\nWait, in the code above, I tried to define it inside main, but that's not allowed. So I need to define it outside.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define LIMIT 10000000000LL\n#define MAX_L_SIZE 350\n\nlong long l[MAX_L_SIZE];\nint l_count =0;\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(long long*)a - *(long long*)b);\n}\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n    // ... as before\n}\n\nvoid gen(int number, int four, int seven) {\n    // ... as before\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // ... all the steps\n}\n\nWait, but the aaa function's parameters are current and N. Let me recheck the code.\n\nNow, the code for aaa:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int valid =1;\n    if (current ==0) valid=0;\n    else {\n        int temp = current;\n        while (temp >0) {\n            int digit = temp%10;\n            if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n                valid =0;\n                break;\n            }\n            temp /=10;\n        }\n    }\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n    for (int d : {3,5,7}) { // Not valid in C. Need to loop with a for loop.\n        // Wait, in C, can't do that. So need to loop over 3,5,7.\n        // So perhaps loop over an array.\n        int digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n        for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n            int d = digits[i];\n            ans += aaa(current*10 +d, N);\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, in C, the for loop over {3,5,7} is not possible. So I need to loop over an array.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nint digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    int d = digits[i];\n\n    ans += aaa(current*10 +d, N);\n\n}\n\nThus, the function becomes:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int valid =1;\n    if (current ==0) valid=0;\n    else {\n        int temp = current;\n        while (temp >0) {\n            int digit = temp%10;\n            if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n                valid =0;\n                break;\n            }\n            temp /=10;\n        }\n    }\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n    int digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        ans += aaa(current*10 + digits[i], N);\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code for the third part's gen function:\n\nvoid gen(int number, int four, int seven) {\n\n    if (number > LIMIT) return;\n\n    if (number >0 && four == seven) {\n\n        l[l_count] = number;\n\n        l_count++;\n\n    }\n\n    gen(number*10 +4, four+1, seven);\n\n    gen(number*10 +7, four, seven+1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the initial call is gen(0,0,0). The first call will check number=0, which is not >0, so no addition. Then it calls gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1).\n\nThis should generate all numbers with equal 4 and 7 counts.\n\nNow, in main:\n\nAfter computing the count (second part's result), we need to call gen(0,0,0), then sort l, then perform the binary search.\n\nWait, but in the code, the gen function is called with initial parameters, and l_count is a global variable. So in main:\n\nl_count =0;\n\ngen(0,0,0);\n\nThen sort the array l up to l_count elements.\n\nThen perform the binary search.\n\nNow, the code for the third part's binary search:\n\nint target = count;\n\nint low =0, high = l_count-1;\n\nint index = -1;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    int mid = (low + high)/2;\n\n    if (l[mid] >= target) {\n\n        index = mid;\n\n        high = mid-1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        low = mid+1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (index != -1) {\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", l[index]);\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n}\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, let's check for possible errors.\n\nFirst part's energy calculation:\n\nThe code in Python has:\n\nif i > (n -i):\n\n    energy += (i - (n -i) -1)*QL\n\nelif (n -i) >i:\n\n    energy += ((n -i) -i -1)*QR\n\nIn C, the code I wrote was:\n\nint diff = i - (n -i);\n\nif (diff >0) { // i > (n-i)\n\n    energy += (diff -1)*QL;\n\n} else if (diff <0) { // (n-i) >i\n\n    energy += ( ( (n -i) -i ) -1 ) * QR;\n\n}\n\nWait, (n-i) -i is the same as (n -2i). So (diff <0) implies that (n-i) >i.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the first part's code should be okay.\n\nNow, the second part's aaa function:\n\nThe initial call is aaa(0, N). The function returns the count of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N.\n\nThe code's valid check ensures that all digits are 3,5,7. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the third part's gen function:\n\nThe numbers are generated with equal counts of 4 and 7. The code appends to the array when number>0 and four == seven.\n\nThus, the list l contains all such numbers up to LIMIT.\n\nSorting and searching should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The first part's variables may be too large for int. For example, sum_el[n] could be up to n elements of W, which are integers. If n is up to 1e5, and W elements are up to 1e9, then sum_el could be up to 1e14, which is beyond int (max 2e9). So sum_el should be stored as long long.\n\nAh, right! The first part's variables may overflow. So in C, the sum_el array should be of type long long to prevent overflow.\n\nSo in the first part's code:\n\nChange sum_el to long long:\n\nlong long sum_el[n+1];\n\nand the answer and energy variables should also be long long.\n\nBecause the initial answer is QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R. If sum_el[n] is large, this could be a very big number, possibly exceeding int's capacity.\n\nThus, in the first part:\n\nChange variables to long long:\n\nIn main:\n\nlong long n, L, R, QL, QR;\n\nWait, but in the input, n is read as an integer. So perhaps the variables should be:\n\nWait, the first Python code's first line is:\n\nn, L, R, QL, QR = map(int, input().split())\n\nSo n is an integer. So in C, n is an int. But the sum_el array's elements can be large. So sum_el should be long long.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nint n, L, R, QL, QR;\n\nlong long W[n]; // Wait, no, in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99, but the size is known at runtime.\n\nWait, in C, the array W is declared as int W[n]; but n is read from input. So that's okay in C99.\n\nBut sum_el is an array of long long:\n\nlong long sum_el[n+1];\n\nThe initial answer is computed as:\n\nlong long answer = QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\nThe energy is also a long long:\n\nlong long energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n\nThus, the variables must be declared as long long.\n\nSo modifying the first part's code:\n\nIn main:\n\nint n, L, R, QL, QR;\n\nscanf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n\nint W[n];\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &W[i]);\n\n}\n\nlong long sum_el[n+1];\n\nsum_el[0] =0;\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1];\n\n}\n\nlong long answer = QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    long long energy = L * sum_el[i] + R*(sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n\n    int diff = i - (n -i);\n\n    if (diff >0) {\n\n        energy += (diff -1)*QL;\n\n    } else if (diff <0) {\n\n        energy += ( ( (n -i) -i ) -1 ) * QR;\n\n    }\n\n    if (energy < answer) {\n\n        answer = energy;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the variables are now using long long where necessary.\n\nNow, the second part's N is the first part's answer, which is a long long. But the second part's function aaa takes an int N. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nBecause the first part's answer can be a very large number (since it's a long long), but the second part's N is passed as an int, which can only hold up to 2e9. So this is a problem.\n\nAh, right! The second part's N is the first part's answer, which could be a very large number (since it's the minimum energy, which could be up to QR*(n-1) + sum_el[n]*R, which could be huge if sum_el[n] is large).\n\nThus, the second part's function must handle N as a long long, not an int.\n\nThis is a critical error in the current code.\n\nSo the second part's function must be modified to take N as a long long, and the current as a long long as well.\n\nThus, the function aaa must be:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    // ... rest of code.\n\n}\n\nBut then, the parameters are long long.\n\nBut in C, recursion with large numbers may hit stack limits, but since the depth is logarithmic in N, it's manageable.\n\nThus, the second part's variables must be adjusted.\n\nSo, modifying the second part's function:\n\nint aaa(int current, int N) \u2192 becomes:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    // ... \n\n    // the valid check remains the same.\n\n    // the digits are still 3,5,7.\n\n    // the return value is the count, which can be up to the number of valid numbers up to N.\n\n    // which for N up to 1e18 is manageable as a long long.\n\n}\n\nWait, but the count can be up to the number of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N. For N=1e18, the count is the number of such numbers with up to 18 digits, which is 3^18 \u2248 3.8e8, which fits in a long long.\n\nThus, the function's return type should be long long.\n\nThus, the function signature is:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    // ...\n\n}\n\nIn main:\n\nlong long N = answer; // since answer is a long long.\n\nlong long count = aaa(0, N);\n\nThus, the second part's code must be adjusted.\n\nThis is a crucial fix.\n\nNow, the third part's input n is count, which is a long long. But the third part's code requires n to be an integer (since the third part's code in Python reads n as an integer). But in the third part's code, the input n is the second part's output, which is count (a long long). But the third part's code must process it as an integer. However, the third part's code in Python reads n as an integer, so if count exceeds the maximum integer (2e9), then the third part's code would have an error. But according to the problem's third code, the input is read as an integer, so perhaps the problem expects that the second part's output is within integer range. But since the first part's answer can be very large, this may not be the case. However, the problem's third code's input is whatever the second part outputs, so in C, the third part's n is count, which is a long long, but the code must treat it as an integer. However, in the third part's code, the numbers are up to 1e10, so if count exceeds 1e10, then the third part's code would output 0 (since no number in l is >= count). Thus, in C, the third part's target is (long long) count, but the code can proceed.\n\nThus, the third part's code can handle it as a long long.\n\nThus, the third part's target is count (a long long), and the binary search is done with l[mid] (long long) compared to target (long long).\n\nThus, the code for the third part's binary search uses long long variables.\n\nWait, the l array is of type long long, so the comparison is okay.\n\nThus, the code for the third part's binary search is okay.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's function:\n\nlong long aaa(long long current, long long N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    int valid =1;\n\n    if (current ==0) valid=0;\n\n    else {\n\n        long long temp = current;\n\n        while (temp >0) {\n\n            int digit = temp%10;\n\n            if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n\n                valid =0;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n            temp /=10;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    long long ans = valid ? 1LL :0LL;\n\n    int digits[3] = {3,5,7};\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n        ans += aaa(current*10 + digits[i], N);\n\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but current is a long long, so current*10 could overflow. For example, if current is 1e18, multiplying by 10 would exceed 64 bits (if using 64-bit long long). But in C, long long is 64 bits, so the maximum is 9e18. So for N up to 1e18, current can be up to N, so current*10 can be up to 1e19, which is larger than 9e18 (if N is 1e18). Thus, this would overflow.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The function's current can be up to N, which could be up to the first part's answer, which could be very large. Thus, when multiplying by 10, it may overflow.\n\nThus, the function must check whether current*10 exceeds N before proceeding.\n\nWait, but the function's base case is if current > N, return 0. So when current is N/10, then current*10 could be N or more. So in the recursive calls, when current*10 exceeds N, the function will return 0.\n\nBut the multiplication itself could overflow, leading to incorrect results.\n\nThus, to prevent overflow, we can check before making the recursive call:\n\nif (current > (N - digits[i])/10) then skip.\n\nAlternatively, in the recursive call:\n\nif (current > (N - digits[i])/10) then the next number would exceed N, so no need to proceed.\n\nBut this requires careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, in the recursive call:\n\nlong long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\nif (next > N) continue;\n\nans += aaa(next, N);\n\nBut this requires computing next first and checking.\n\nThus, modifying the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    long long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\n    if (next > N) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    ans += aaa(next, N);\n\n}\n\nThis way, we avoid overflow in the multiplication, because if current is already large enough that current*10 exceeds N, then next would be larger than N, so the function returns 0 anyway.\n\nThus, this is a safer approach.\n\nThus, the code for the loop becomes:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n    long long next = current *10 + digits[i];\n\n    if (next > N) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    ans += aaa(next, N);\n\n}\n\nThis prevents overflow in the multiplication step.\n\nThus, the function is now safe.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's function is fixed.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's count is:\n\nlong long count = aaa(0, N);\n\nThus, the third part's target is count, which is a long long.\n\nThe third part's code uses l array of long long, so the comparisons are okay.\n\nNow, the third part's code's gen function:\n\nThe numbers are stored as long long, so the array l is okay.\n\nThus, the code should now handle large numbers correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final C code is as follows."
