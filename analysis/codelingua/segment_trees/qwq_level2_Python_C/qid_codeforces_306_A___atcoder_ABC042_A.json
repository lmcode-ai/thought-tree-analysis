Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, the first Python file takes two integers n and m from input. It calculates q as the quotient of n divided by m, and r as the remainder. Then it creates a list 'a' with m elements, each initially q. Then it adds 1 to the first 'r' elements. Finally, it prints all elements of 'a' separated by spaces.\n\nThe second Python file reads three integers as ABC, which are probably A, B, C. It checks if exactly two of them are 5. If so, it checks if their sum is 17 and prints YES or NO accordingly. Otherwise, it just prints NO.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single C program. The key is that the output of the first Python program is the input to the second. So the C program must process the first part, then use its result as input for the second part, all in one go without I/O in between.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. The first part's output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. The second part expects three integers as input. Wait, the second Python file's input is three numbers (since ABC is a tuple of three elements). Wait, the first program's output is m numbers. But the second program expects three numbers. So m must be 3 here? Because otherwise, the input to the second program would not be three numbers. Wait, the original code's first program's output is m numbers. The second program's input is three numbers. So the first program must have m=3. But how does that work? Wait, the user's input for the first program is n and m. So the first program's output is m numbers, which must be three numbers for the second program to read them as ABC. Therefore, in the original setup, the first program's m must be 3. Otherwise, the second program would get the wrong number of inputs. So the user's input to the entire sequence must be such that m is 3. Hmm, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that behaves the same. So the C program must process the first part, then the second part, using the outputs of the first as inputs to the second, but without any I/O in between. So the first part's output is the list of numbers, which are then the inputs for the second part. Therefore, the first part's output must be three numbers, so m must be 3. Wait, but the first program's m is given as input. So the user's input to the first program must have m=3, otherwise the second program would get a different number of inputs. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must handle any valid input that the original Python chain would. Wait, but the second Python program expects exactly three numbers. So the first program's m must be 3. Therefore, the user's input to the first program must have m=3. Otherwise, the second program would fail. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so perhaps the C program must handle that. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is m numbers, which are then the input to the second program. The second program expects three numbers, so m must be 3. Therefore, the first program's m must be 3. So the user's input to the first program must have m=3. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must process the first part, then the second part, regardless of m? Wait, but the second program can't process if m isn't 3. So perhaps the original code's second program is expecting the three numbers from the first's output. Therefore, the first program's m must be 3. So the user's input to the first program must have m=3. Therefore, in the C program, the first part will process n and m (with m being 3), then the second part will process those three numbers. So the C program must first read n and m, then compute the array, then check if m is 3 (since otherwise the second part can't proceed?), but the problem says to translate the entire sequence. Wait, but the original Python code's second program would read whatever the first outputs, even if it's not three numbers. But in that case, the second program would crash because it expects three numbers. So the problem's original setup must have m=3. Therefore, the C program must process the first part, then the second part, but the second part can only process if the first part's m is 3. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so perhaps the C program must do exactly what the Python does, even if the second part's input is invalid. Wait, but in the second Python program, if the input is not three numbers, then the code would crash when trying to make a tuple of three elements. So the C program must replicate that behavior. Hmm, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that behaves identically. So the C program must first process the first part, then the second part, using the first's output as the second's input. So the first part's output is m numbers, which are then the input to the second part. The second part expects three numbers, so if m is not 3, then the second part would have an error. But in the original code, the second program would read the numbers from the first's output. So if the first outputs m numbers, then the second program would read those m numbers as its input. But the second program's code is expecting exactly three numbers. So if m is not 3, then the second program would have an error. Therefore, the C program must handle that. So in the C code, after the first part, the second part must read exactly three numbers. So the first part must have m=3. Therefore, the user's input to the first program must have m=3. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so perhaps the C program must process the first part, then the second part, even if m is not 3. But in that case, the second part would have an error. So the C program must do exactly what the Python does. Let me think again. The first Python program's output is m numbers. The second program reads those m numbers as its input. The second program's code is expecting three numbers. So if m is not 3, then the second program would have an error. So the C program must do the same. Therefore, in the C code, after the first part, the second part must read exactly three numbers. So the first part must have m=3. Therefore, the user's input must have m=3. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so perhaps the C program must process the first part, then the second part, even if m is not 3, but then the second part would have an error. So the C program must replicate that. Therefore, in the C code, after the first part, the second part will read the m numbers from the first part's output, but the second part expects three numbers. So if m is not 3, then the second part will have an error. So the C program must handle that. Therefore, the C code must first process the first part, then the second part, using the first's output as the second's input. So the first part's output is stored in an array, then passed to the second part. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nIn C:\n\n- Read n and m from input.\n\n- Compute the array a as per the first Python program.\n\n- Then, check if m is 3. Because the second part requires three numbers. If m is not 3, then the second part can't proceed. But in the original code, the second program would read the m numbers, but if m is not 3, then the tuple would have length m, but the code checks for ABC.count(5) == 2. So in that case, if m is not 3, then the code would have an error when trying to read three numbers. Wait, in Python, if the input has m numbers, then the split would give a list of m elements, but the code expects three. So if m is not 3, then the code would crash when trying to make a tuple of three elements. So in the C code, the second part must read exactly three numbers. Therefore, if m is not 3, then the second part can't proceed. So the C program must first process the first part, then check if m is 3. If not, then the second part can't run, so perhaps output nothing? Or the second part would have an error. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must do exactly what the original does. So in the original, if m is not 3, the second program would have an error. But in the problem's context, perhaps the user is supposed to input m=3. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must handle all cases. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is m numbers. So the second program's input is those m numbers. The second program's code is expecting three numbers. So if m is not 3, then the second program would read the first three numbers (if m >=3) or less, but in Python, the input().split() would split all the numbers, so if the first program outputs m numbers, then the second program's input is those m numbers. So the code in the second program would have ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split())). So if m is 3, then ABC is a tuple of three numbers. If m is 2, then the tuple would have two elements, and when trying to do ABC.count(5), it would work, but when checking ABC.count(5) ==2, but then the code would proceed. Wait, but the code then does sum(ABC). So if m is 2, then the code would proceed, but the code's logic would be different. Wait, the second program's code is:\n\nif ABC.count(5) == 2:\n    print('YES' if sum(ABC) ==17 else 'NO')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\nSo if the input has two numbers, then ABC is a tuple of two elements. Then ABC.count(5) would count how many 5s are in the two elements. If that's 2, then it checks the sum. But the sum would be the sum of two numbers. So for example, if the two numbers are 5 and 5, sum is 10, so it would print NO. But the code would not crash. Wait, but the code expects three numbers. Wait, the problem's second Python program is written expecting three numbers. But if the first program outputs two numbers, then the second program would have a tuple of two elements, but the code would still run. So the C program must replicate that behavior. So the second part must read exactly m numbers (the output of the first part), and process them as a tuple of length m. But the code in the second part checks if the count of 5s is exactly 2, and then checks the sum. So in the C code, the second part must read m numbers, then check if exactly two of them are 5, and then check the sum. Wait, but the original second Python program's code is written for three numbers. Wait, the code in the second program is written as:\n\nif ABC.count(5) == 2:\n    print('YES' if sum(ABC) ==17 else 'NO')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\nSo if the input is three numbers, then the code works as intended. But if the input is two numbers, then the code would check if two of them are 5, then check if their sum is 17. So the C program must do the same. Therefore, the second part must process the m numbers from the first part, regardless of m. So the second part's logic is: count the number of 5s in the array, if that count is exactly 2, then check if the sum of all elements is 17. If yes, output YES, else NO. Else, output NO.\n\nWait, that's different from the original second Python code. Wait, the original second code's logic is:\n\nif the count of 5s in the three numbers is exactly two, then check if their sum is 17. Else, output NO.\n\nBut if the input is not three numbers, then the code would still run. For example, if the input is two numbers, then the count of 5s could be 2, and the sum would be checked. So the second program's code is not restricted to three numbers. The problem's second Python program is written with the assumption that the input is three numbers, but the code itself doesn't enforce that. So the C program must handle any number of numbers from the first part's output.\n\nWait, but the original second Python program's code is written as:\n\nABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\nSo it reads all the numbers from the input. So the second part's input is whatever the first part outputs. So the second part's code is:\n\nif the count of 5 in the list is exactly 2, then check if the sum is 17, else output NO.\n\nWait, no. The code says:\n\nif ABC.count(5) == 2:\n\nthen check sum(ABC) ==17. So the code is written for the case where the input is three numbers, but if the input is more or less, it still works. So the logic is: if exactly two of the input numbers are 5, then check if their sum is 17. Wait, no, the sum is of all numbers, not just the 5s. So the code is:\n\nif the number of 5s in the input is exactly two, then check if the total sum of all numbers is 17. If yes, output YES, else NO. Else, output NO.\n\nTherefore, the second part's logic is:\n\ncount_5 = number of elements equal to 5 in the input list.\n\nif count_5 ==2:\n\n    if sum of all elements ==17 \u2192 YES else NO\n\nelse:\n\n    NO\n\nTherefore, the second part's code can handle any number of input elements. So the C program must do the same.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first process the first part (the first Python file's code), then process the second part (the second Python file's code) using the array from the first part as input.\n\nSo the steps for the C program:\n\n1. Read n and m from input.\n\n2. Compute the array a as per the first Python program.\n\n3. Then, process this array as the input to the second part's logic.\n\nSo the second part's logic is:\n\ncount_5 = number of elements in a equal to 5.\n\nif count_5 ==2:\n\n    sum_total = sum of all elements in a.\n\n    if sum_total ==17 \u2192 print \"YES\"\n\n    else \u2192 print \"NO\"\n\nelse:\n\n    print \"NO\"\n\nTherefore, the C program can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Compute the array a of size m.\n\n- Then compute count_5 and sum_total.\n\n- Then decide the output based on those.\n\nWait, but the second part's input is the array from the first part. So the second part's input is exactly the array a from the first part. So the C program can combine both steps into one, without needing to output and read again. So the entire process is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nCompute array a as per first part.\n\nThen compute count_5 and sum_total based on a.\n\nThen output \"YES\" or \"NO\" as per the second part's logic.\n\nWait, but the second part's code in Python is:\n\nif ABC.count(5) ==2 \u2192 then check sum.\n\nBut in the C code, the array a is the input to the second part. So the C code can directly process the array a.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nCompute the array a.\n\nThen compute count_5 and sum_total.\n\nThen decide the output.\n\nTherefore, the C program can be written without any intermediate I/O, as required.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and m from stdin.\n\nCompute the array a as per first Python code.\n\nThen compute count_5 and sum_total.\n\nThen output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nWait, but the second Python program's code is expecting the three numbers from the first's output. But in the C code, the second part's logic is applied directly to the array a. So this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the C program can be written as follows:\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen compute the array a.\n\nThen process the array a to compute count_5 and sum.\n\nThen output the result.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    int a[m]; // assuming m is known at compile time? Wait, no, m is variable. So need dynamic array.\n\nWait, in C, arrays need to have a size known at compile time unless using dynamic allocation. Since m can be any value, we need to use a dynamic array. But in C, that requires using malloc. Alternatively, since the maximum possible m can be up to n (since m can be 1, but n can be very large?), but perhaps the problem constraints are such that m is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that m is not too big, so we can use a fixed size array. But to be safe, perhaps use dynamic allocation.\n\nWait, but in the first Python code, the array a has m elements. So in C, we can do:\n\nint *a = malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n\nBut need to handle m=0? Probably not, since m is given as input, and in the first Python code, m must be at least 1 (since you can't divide by zero). So the code must ensure m is positive. But the problem may not require handling that.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nCheck if m is zero? Probably not, but proceed.\n\nCompute q = n/m, r = n%m.\n\nInitialize all elements of a to q.\n\nThen add 1 to the first r elements.\n\nThen compute count_5 and sum_total.\n\nThen decide output.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    int *a = malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n    if (!a) {\n        // handle error, but maybe assume it works\n    }\n\n    int q = n / m;\n    int r = n % m;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        a[i] = q;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {\n        a[i]++;\n    }\n\n    // Now process for second part\n    int count5 = 0;\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        if (a[i] == 5) {\n            count5++;\n        }\n        sum += a[i];\n    }\n\n    if (count5 == 2) {\n        if (sum == 17) {\n            printf(\"YES\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"NO\");\n        }\n    } else {\n        printf(\"NO\");\n    }\n\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but the second part's code in Python first checks if the count of 5 is exactly 2, then checks the sum. So this code does exactly that.\n\nWait, but in the second Python code, the sum is of the three numbers (if m was 3). But in the C code, the sum is of all elements in a, which is exactly what the second Python code does. Because the second Python code's sum is of all elements in ABC, which is the list of m elements from the first part. So yes, this is correct.\n\nTherefore, this C code should replicate the behavior of the two Python programs in sequence.\n\nWait, but let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose the first Python program's input is n=10, m=3.\n\nThen q=3, r=1. So the array a is [4,3,3].\n\nThen the second part's input is 4,3,3.\n\ncount5 is 0, so output is NO.\n\nAnother example: n=12, m=3 \u2192 q=4, r=0 \u2192 array [4,4,4]. count5 is 0 \u2192 NO.\n\nAnother example where it should work: Let's see, what input would make the second part output YES?\n\nSuppose the array a has two 5s and the sum is 17.\n\nSuppose m=3, and the array is [5,5,7]. Then count5 is 2, sum is 17 \u2192 YES.\n\nWait, but how to get that array from the first part?\n\nLet me see: n and m such that when divided, the array has two 5s and one 7.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose m=3.\n\nWe need the array to be [5,5,7]. So the base q is (n - r) / m ?\n\nWait, the first part's code:\n\nq = n/m, r = n%m.\n\nThe array starts as [q, q, q], then adds 1 to the first r elements.\n\nSuppose the desired array is [5,5,7]. Wait, that's not possible because the first two elements would be q +1, and the third q. Wait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the desired array is [5,5,7]. Then the base q would be 5 for the first two elements, but the third is 7? That can't be. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7]. Then the base q would be 5 for the first two elements, but the third is 7? That would require that q is 5, and r is 2 (since first two elements get +1). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose q is 4, and r is 2. Then the array would be [5,5,4]. Then sum is 14. Not 17.\n\nHmm, maybe another example. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is [5,6,6]. Then count5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother example: array [5,5,7]. Let's see how to get that.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n = 5+5+7 = 17, m=3. Then q = 17/3 = 5 (since 5*3=15, remainder 2). So r=2.\n\nSo the array starts as [5,5,5], then add 1 to first two elements \u2192 [6,6,5]. So that's not the desired array.\n\nHmm, maybe another example where the array is [5,6,6]. Then count5 is 1, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct example is when the array is [5,6,6], but that's not. Let me think of a case where two elements are 5 and the sum is 17.\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7]. The sum is 17. So count5 is 2. So that would output YES.\n\nTo get that array from the first part:\n\nThe array is [5,5,7]. So the base q must be 5 for the first two elements, but the third is 7. Wait, that's not possible because the base q is the same for all elements. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7]. The base q would be 5 for the first two elements, but the third is 7. That would require that the base q is 5, and the third element is 5 + 2? No, because the remainder r is the number of elements to add 1. So the third element can only be q or q+1.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7]. The third element is 7, which is q + 2. That can't happen because the remainder r is the number of elements to add 1. So the third element can only be q or q+1. So the third element can't be 7 unless q is 6 and r is 0, but then the first two would be 6. Hmm, maybe this is impossible. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7]. To get that, the base q must be 5, and the third element is 7. That would require that the third element was added 2, but the code only adds 1 to the first r elements. So that's not possible. So perhaps there is no input to the first program that would produce an array with two 5s and a 7. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [5,5,7], but that's not possible. Let me think of another case where two elements are 5 and the sum is 17.\n\nSuppose the array is [5,6,6]. Sum is 17? 5+6+6=17? 17? 5+6+6 is 17? 5+6 is 11, plus 6 is 17. Yes. So sum is 17. But count5 is 1 \u2192 so output is NO.\n\nHmm, maybe another example where two elements are 5 and the third is 7. Wait, sum would be 17? 5+5+7=17 \u2192 yes. But how to get that array?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n = 17, m=3.\n\nThen q = 17//3 =5, remainder 2.\n\nSo the array starts as [5,5,5], then add 1 to first two elements \u2192 [6,6,5]. So the array is [6,6,5]. The count of 5 is 1, so output is NO.\n\nHmm, so maybe there is no input where the first program's output would have two 5s and a 7. Let me think of another case.\n\nSuppose m=2, n=10. Then q=5, r=0. So array is [5,5]. Then the second part's count5 is 2, sum is 10. So the second part would check if sum is 17 \u2192 no. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: m=2, n=12 \u2192 q=6, r=0 \u2192 array [6,6]. count5 is 0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, maybe the only way to get two 5s and a sum of 17 is with m=3 and the array [5,6,6]. Wait, sum is 17, but count5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m=4, and the array has two 5s and the sum is 17. Let's see:\n\nSuppose m=4, n=17. Then q=4, r=1. So array is [5,4,4,4]. count5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, perhaps there is no input that would make the second part output YES. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of m=3 and n=15. Then q=5, r=0 \u2192 array [5,5,5]. count5 is 3 \u2192 so output NO.\n\nHmm, maybe the only way to get two 5s and sum 17 is with m=3 and the array [5,6,6]. But that's sum 17, but count5 is 1. So no.\n\nWait, maybe m=5 and n=22. Let's see:\n\nq = 22//5 =4, r=2. So array is [5,5,4,4,4]. The first two elements are 5. count5 is 2. Sum is 5+5+4+4+4 = 22. So sum is 22, so output NO.\n\nHmm, maybe there is no input that would make the second part output YES. But perhaps the problem's second Python code is designed for a specific case where the first program's output is three numbers adding to 17 with two 5s. Like, for example, n=16 and m=3.\n\nWait n=16, m=3 \u2192 q=5, r=1. So array is [6,5,5]. Because the first element gets +1. So the array is [6,5,5]. Then count5 is 2, sum is 16. So sum is 16, so output NO.\n\nHmm, maybe n=17 and m=3 \u2192 array [6,6,5]. sum is 17. count5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, what if the array is [5,6,6], sum is 17, but count5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, maybe the only way to get two 5s and sum 17 is with three numbers like 5,5,7. But how to get that array?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose m=3, n=17. Then q=5, r=2. So array is [6,6,5]. The count of 5 is 1. So no.\n\nHmm, maybe there is no possible input where the second part outputs YES. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second part's code is designed for when the first part's output is three numbers, and the correct case is when two of them are 5 and the third is 7, but that requires the first part's array to have two 5s and a 7. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of n=17 and m=3. The array is [6,6,5]. Not two 5s.\n\nWait, maybe n=10 and m=2. Then q=5, r=0 \u2192 array [5,5]. Then the second part's count5 is 2, sum is 10. So the second part would check if sum is 17 \u2192 no. So output NO.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem's second code is expecting that the first program's output is three numbers, and the correct case is when two are 5 and the third is 7, but that requires the first program's array to have two 5s and a 7. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps n=17 and m=3 \u2192 array [6,6,5]. Not two 5s.\n\nWait, maybe n=15 and m=3 \u2192 array [5,5,5]. count5 is 3 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, maybe there's no input that would make the second part output YES. But perhaps the problem is designed so that when the first program's output is three numbers adding to 17 with two 5s, like 5,6,6 (sum 17, but only one 5). Not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct case is when the first program's output is 5,5,7. But how?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose m=3, n=17. Then q=5, r=2. So the array is [6,6,5]. Not two 5s.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem's second code is expecting that the first program's output is three numbers, and the correct case is when two are 5 and the third is 7, but that requires the first program's array to have two 5s and a 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first part's code.\n\nWait, the first part's code:\n\na = [q] * m \u2192 all elements are q.\n\nThen for i in range(r): a[i] +=1.\n\nSo the first r elements are q+1, the rest are q.\n\nSo to have two 5s, the elements must be either q+1 or q.\n\nSuppose q is 4, and r is 2. Then two elements are 5, and the rest are 4.\n\nSo for example, m=3, r=2 \u2192 array [5,5,4]. Sum is 14 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct case is when the array is [5,5,7], but that requires that one element is q+2, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's second code is designed for a case where the first program's output is three numbers like 5,6,6. Then the count of 5 is 1, so output is NO. So maybe there is no input that would make the second part output YES. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's second code is expecting that the first program's output is three numbers adding to 17 with two 5s. Let me think of n=17 and m=3. The array is [6,6,5]. Sum is 17, but count5 is 1 \u2192 output NO.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem's second code is designed for a different scenario. Maybe the first program's output is three numbers like 5,5,7. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps m=3 and n=17. Then q=5, r=2. So the array is [6,6,5]. Not two 5s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's second code is expecting that the first program's output is three numbers like 5,6,6. Then the count of 5 is 1, so output is NO. So maybe the second code's 'YES' case is not achievable with the first code's output. But the problem requires to translate the code, not to find inputs. So regardless, the C code must do exactly what the two Python programs do in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the C code I wrote earlier should be correct. Let me check again.\n\nThe code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nCompute array a as per first part.\n\nThen count the number of 5s in a, and sum all elements.\n\nIf count5 is 2 and sum is 17 \u2192 YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the C code is as written above. The only thing left is to make sure that the code uses dynamic allocation for the array. Also, in C, the array indices start at 0, so the loops are correct.\n\nWait, in the first part's code, the first r elements are incremented. So in C, the loop for (i from 0 to r-1) \u2192 which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
