So to handle all possible inputs (as per Python's behavior), we need to read them as long long. Therefore, changing the code:\n\nUse long long for ans and the elements in l.\n\nSo:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    long long *l = malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &l[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    long long ans = n-1;\n\n    long long last =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        ans += abs(last - l[i]) +1;\n\n        last = l[i];\n\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part. char s[21];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    if (len ! =4) {\n\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        int counts[256] = {0};\n\n        for (int i=0; s[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n\n            counts[s[i]]++;\n\n        }\n\n        int count2 =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n            if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n                count2++;\n\n            } else if (counts[i] ! =0) {\n\n                count2 = -1; // invalid\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (count2 ==2) {\n\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n        } else {\n\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    free(l);\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but the elements in l are read as long long, so the scanf format is %lld. Also, the ans is a long long, so when using sprintf, the format is %lld. This way, even large numbers can be handled up to the limits of long long. However, if ans exceeds 9999, the second part will output \"No\", which is correct. This should handle all cases correctly. Another possible issue: when the ans is negative. But in the first part's code, ans starts at n-1 (which is at least 0 when n>=1), and each term added is abs(...) +1, which is non-negative. So ans is always non-negative. So the string will not have a '-'. Thus, the code should be correct now.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It reads an integer n, then reads n integers into a list l. Then it calculates ans as n-1, and loops through the list, adding the absolute difference between the current element and last, plus 1, to ans. Finally, it prints ans. So the output of this first program is the 'ans' value computed here.\n\nThen, the second Python file (File 2) takes a string S, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. If so, it prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nThe challenge is to combine these into a single C program. The key points are:\n\n- The first part (File 1) must read input, process it, and pass the result to the second part (File 2) without writing to output. But since they are in sequence, the output of File1 is the input for File2. Wait, but in the original setup, each program is run in sequence, so the output of the first is the input to the second. But in the C program, we can't have that. So the C program must process both steps in sequence, using the data in memory.\n\nWait, the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the first part's input is read from stdin, then the first part's output is used as the input to the second part. But in C, we can't have the first part's output be the input to the second part unless we pass the data through variables.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input for the first part (n and the list l) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the 'ans' value as per File1.\n\n3. Then, use that 'ans' as part of the input for the second part? Wait, no. Wait, the second part's input is a string S. Wait, looking back: the second Python file's input is S, which is a string. So the first program's output (the ans) is not the input to the second program. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the original setup is that the first program's output is the input to the second program? Or are they separate?\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output (the ans) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string S as input. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the user provided two Python files. The first one's code is:\n\nFile1 reads n, then n integers, computes ans, and prints ans. Then File2 reads a string S, processes it, and prints \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but according to the problem's instruction, the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output (ans) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string S. That would mean that the second program is getting the number ans as its input, but it's expecting a string with two characters each appearing twice. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the two Python files are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are separate. Like, the first program reads its own input, produces an output, then the second program reads its own input, produces its own output. But the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But in the given code, the second program's input is a string S, which is read via input(). So the first program's output (a number) would be the input to the second program, which expects a string. That would not work unless the second program is expecting a number as input, but in the code given, the second program is expecting a string S. So perhaps there's a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided two Python files. The first one's code is:\n\n# File 1\nn = int(input())\nl = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    l.append(int(input()))\nans = n - 1\nlast = 0\nfor i in l:\n    ans += abs(last - i) + 1\n    last = i\nprint(ans)\n\nSo the first program's output is ans, which is a number.\n\nThe second program's code is:\n\n# File 2\nfrom collections import Counter\nS = input()\nc = Counter(S)\nSa = set(list(S))\nif len(Sa) != 2:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\nfor i in Sa:\n    if c[i] != 2:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\nprint(\"Yes\")\n\nSo the second program reads a string S from input. So the output of the first program (a number) is the input to the second program. But the second program is expecting a string S. So the second program would read the number as a string? Like, if the first program outputs 4, then the second program's S would be \"4\", but then the check would see if that string has exactly two characters each appearing twice. Which would only be true if the number is two digits, each appearing twice, like \"22\" or \"11\". But that's probably not the intended case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Alternatively, maybe the two programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs are separate. Like, the first program reads its own input (n and the list), outputs ans, then the second program reads its own input (the string S), and outputs its result. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", so the first's output is the second's input. But that would require that the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's input is a number (the ans from first), but the second program is expecting a string S. So perhaps the second program is supposed to read that number as a string? Like, if the first outputs 12, then the second's S is \"12\", which has two characters, each appearing once. So the second would output \"No\".\n\nBut the problem says that the C program must reproduce the same behavior. So the C program must first read the first program's input (n and the list), compute ans, then use that ans as the input to the second part, which would process it as a string. So the second part's input is the string representation of ans.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the second program's input is a separate input. But according to the problem's instruction, the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the second's input. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's S is the string version of the first's ans.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first read the first program's input (n and the list), compute ans, then process that ans as the input S for the second part. So the second part's processing is done on the string representation of ans.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the first part's input (n and the list of integers).\n\n2. Compute ans as per the first Python code.\n\n3. Then, take the string representation of ans as the input S for the second part.\n\n4. Process S as per the second Python code, and output the result.\n\nSo the C program must combine both steps, using the first's output as the input to the second's processing.\n\nNow, how to structure this in C.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\n- Read n from stdin.\n\n- Read n integers into an array.\n\n- Compute ans as n-1, then loop through the array, adding abs(last - current) +1 each time, updating last.\n\nThen, the second part's variables:\n\n- Take the ans from first part, convert it to a string S.\n\n- Check if S has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array.\n\nCompute ans as per first part.\n\nThen, convert ans to a string (like using sprintf into a buffer).\n\nThen process that string as per the second part's logic.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, the first part's code in C:\n\nRead n via scanf(\"%d\", &n). Then read n integers into an array of size n. Wait, but in C, we need to dynamically allocate the array, or use a fixed size. Since n can be up to... Well, the problem doesn't specify constraints, but assuming n is manageable. Let's see, in the first Python code, the list l is built by appending n integers. So in C, we can read them into an array.\n\nWait, but in C, we can't have a variable-length array unless using C99. So perhaps read n first, then allocate an array of size n.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nint *l = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &l[i]);\n\n}\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nint ans = n-1;\n\nint last =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    ans += abs(last - l[i]) +1;\n\n    last = l[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, convert ans to a string. Let's see, the maximum possible ans? Well, depends on the input. But to be safe, we can use a buffer of sufficient size, say 20 characters (since even a 64-bit integer is up to 19 digits, plus null).\n\nchar s[21];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%d\", ans);\n\nThen, process s as per the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's logic:\n\nCheck if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo first, check the length of the string (excluding null terminator) must be 2*2=4? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the string must have exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the total length must be 4. Because 2 characters each appearing twice. So first, check the length of the string (excluding null) is 4.\n\nWait, the second Python code's first check is len(Sa) ==2, which is the number of distinct characters. Then, for each character in Sa, check that its count is 2.\n\nSo in C:\n\nFirst, get the length of the string s. Let's say len = strlen(s).\n\nIf len !=4, then output \"No\".\n\nElse, count the frequency of each character.\n\nWe can use an array to count frequencies. Since characters can be any, but in the string s, which is the number's digits, they are digits 0-9, but maybe other characters? Wait, no, because ans is an integer, so when converted to a string, it's digits only (assuming no negative numbers, since in the first code, the input is read as int, but the problem may assume non-negative? Well, the first code uses abs, so even if the numbers are negative, the ans would be correct. But when converted to a string, negative numbers would have a '-', so the string would have a '-' and digits. So the second part's check would have to account for that.\n\nWait, the first code's ans is computed as n-1 plus some terms. Let's see, n is read as an int, but in the first code, n is the number of elements, so it's at least 1. So ans is at least 0 (if n=1, then ans is 0, but then adding terms? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for n=1, the first loop (for i in l) runs once. The initial ans is 0 (n-1=0). Then ans += abs(0 - l[0]) +1. So ans becomes (abs(0 - l[0]) +1). So ans is at least 1. So the ans can be a positive integer, but could be negative? No, because all terms added are positive. So ans is non-negative. So when converted to a string, it's a non-negative integer, so no '-'.\n\nTherefore, the string s will consist of digits only.\n\nSo the second part's processing can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck the length of s is exactly 4. Because two distinct characters each appearing twice: 2*2=4.\n\nIf not, output \"No\".\n\nElse, count the frequency of each character.\n\nWe can use an array of size 256 (for all possible ASCII characters) to count frequencies.\n\nInitialize all counts to 0.\n\nLoop through each character in s:\n\ncounts[c]++;\n\nThen, collect the characters present. The number of unique characters must be 2.\n\nThen, check each of their counts is 2.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, check that exactly two counts are 2, and the rest are 0.\n\nAlternatively, collect the counts:\n\nint counts[256] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    counts[s[i]]++;\n\n}\n\nint unique =0;\n\nint has_two =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] >0) {\n\n        unique++;\n\n        if (counts[i] !=2) {\n\n            has_two =1; // indicates some count is not 2\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (unique !=2 || has_two) {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but the 'has_two' approach may not capture it correctly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, check that exactly two elements in counts have a value of 2, and all others are 0.\n\nSo:\n\nint count2 =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n        count2++;\n\n    } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n        // some count is not 2, so invalid\n\n        count2 = -1; // flag\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (count2 ==2) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n}\n\nThat's better.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into C code.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int *l = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &l[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = n-1;\n\n    int last =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        ans += abs(last - l[i]) +1;\n\n        last = l[i];\n\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part.\n\n    char s[21];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%d\", ans);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    if (len !=4) {\n\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        int counts[256] = {0};\n\n        for (int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n            counts[s[i]]++;\n\n        }\n\n        int count2 =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n            if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n                count2++;\n\n            } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n                count2 = -1; // invalid\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (count2 ==2) {\n\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n        } else {\n\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    free(l);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but let me check the logic again.\n\nWait, the second part's first check is len(Sa) ==2, which in the code is the number of unique characters. The code above first checks the length of the string is 4. Because if the length is not 4, then even if there are two characters, their counts can't be 2 each. So that's a shortcut. For example, if the string is \"123\", length 3, then it can't have two characters each appearing twice. So the first check is correct.\n\nThen, the counts array is built. Then, we check that exactly two characters have count 2, and others are 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop for counts:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n        count2++;\n\n    } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n        count2 = -1; // invalid\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo, if any count is not 2 and not zero, then set count2 to -1 and break.\n\nAt the end, if count2 is 2, then it's valid.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose the first program's ans is 1212. Then the string is \"1212\", length 4.\n\ncounts for '1' is 2, '2' is 2. So count2 becomes 2, so output \"Yes\".\n\nAnother test case: ans is 1122. Then same result.\n\nIf ans is 1112, then counts for '1' is 3, '2' is 1. So the else if clause triggers, count2 becomes -1, so output \"No\".\n\nIf ans is 1234, then each count is 1, so the else if clause triggers (since counts[i] is 1 !=2), so output \"No\".\n\nIf ans is 1111, then counts for '1' is 4, so else if clause, so \"No\".\n\nIf ans is 12, then the length is 2, so first check fails, output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: ans is 1223. The length is 4, but counts are '1':1, '2':2, '3':1. So the counts for '3' is 1, so the else if clause triggers, so output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: ans is 1122, which should pass.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros? Like ans is 0011? But when converting to a string via sprintf, leading zeros would be part of the string. Wait, but ans is an integer. So if ans is 11, then the string is \"11\", length 2, so first check fails. But if ans is 1010, then the string is \"1010\", length 4. The counts are '1' and '0' each twice. So that would pass.\n\nWait, yes. So the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the ans is 0? Well, 0 would be \"0\", length 1, so output \"No\".\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=1, then the list has one element, say 5.\n\nans starts at 0 (1-1). Then the loop adds abs(0-5)+1 =5+1=6. So ans is 6. The string is \"6\", length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother example where it works:\n\nSuppose the first program's ans is 1212 \u2192 \"1212\" \u2192 output \"Yes\".\n\nAnother example where the second part's input is \"1212\", which is valid.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nIn the first part, when reading the list l, we need to read exactly n integers. The code uses a for loop from 0 to n-1, which is correct.\n\nThe malloc is necessary. We have to free it at the end.\n\nThe sprintf uses the buffer of size 21, which should be enough for any integer up to 2^64 (which is 20 digits). So that's okay.\n\nThe code uses the math.h for abs, which is correct. In C, the abs function is in math.h, but for integers, it's okay. Wait, actually, the abs function in C for integers is in stdlib.h. Wait, no, wait: the function abs() is in stdlib.h for integers. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe C standard library's abs() function is declared in <stdlib.h> and works for int. The fabs() is for floating points in math.h. So in the code above, we need to include stdlib.h for abs. Wait, the code already includes stdlib.h (for malloc and free), so that's okay.\n\nWait, the code includes <stdlib.h>, so that's correct.\n\nYes, so the code should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the ans is a very large number, but in the problem's context, perhaps the constraints are manageable. Since the code uses an int for ans, but in C, an int may be 32 bits. So if ans exceeds 2^31-1, it would overflow. But the problem's original Python code uses integers which can be arbitrarily large, but in C, this could be a problem. However, given that the second part requires the string to have exactly four characters, the ans must be a four-digit number. Because otherwise, the second part would output \"No\". So even if ans is a larger number, the second part would output \"No\", so the overflow in the first part's calculation may not matter. But the problem's original code may have different behavior. Wait, but the problem requires the C code to behave identically to the original chain. So if in the original Python code, the ans could be a number with more than four digits, then the C code would have a problem. But according to the second Python code's logic, the second program would output \"No\" if the input string (the ans) has length not equal to 4. So even if the first part's ans is a 5-digit number, the second part would output \"No\", which is correct. However, if the first part's ans is so large that it overflows in C, then the actual value would be wrong, leading to a different result. But the problem's original code (Python) can handle big integers, so in C, using int may not be sufficient. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the second part's input is the string representation of ans. So if ans is a very large number (like 1000000000000), then the string would be longer than 4, so the second part outputs \"No\". But in C, if ans is stored as an int, and if it overflows, then the actual value would be different, leading to a different string. So this could be an issue.\n\nTo avoid that, perhaps we should use a larger data type for ans, like long long. Let me see.\n\nIn the first part's code, ans is computed as n-1 plus some terms. The maximum possible ans would depend on the input. For example, if n is 1e5 and each step adds a large value, but in the worst case, the ans could be up to O(n * max_value). But in the second part, the string must be exactly four characters. So if the ans is more than 9999, the second part will output \"No\", so the actual value of ans beyond four digits doesn't matter except for the string length. However, if the ans overflows in C, then the string would be wrong. For example, if ans is 2^31, which is 2147483648 (10 digits), but in a 32-bit int, it would overflow to a negative number, leading to a string like \"-2147483648\", which is 11 characters, so the second part would output \"No\". But in Python, the ans would be 2147483648, which is 10 digits, so the second part would also output \"No\". So the overflow in C would lead to a different string (with a '-' sign), but the length is still more than 4, so the output would still be \"No\", which matches the Python's behavior. Wait, but in Python, the number would be positive, so the string would not have a '-', but in C, the overflow would make it negative, leading to a different string. So the outputs would differ in that case.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. To avoid that, perhaps we should use unsigned integers for ans, but even then, if the value exceeds the maximum of unsigned int (4294967295), which is 10 digits, then the string would be 10 digits, leading to \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't require such large numbers, but the code should be correct regardless.\n\nAlternatively, to prevent overflow, use a larger data type like long long. Let's adjust the code to use long long for ans and the elements in the array l.\n\nBecause in the first part, the elements in l can be any integers, but when taking their absolute difference, adding 1, and accumulating into ans, which is an integer. So if the numbers are large, ans can overflow in a 32-bit int.\n\nSo to make the code correct, we should use long long for ans and the elements in l.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nChange the variables:\n\nint n;\n\nto:\n\nint n;\n\nint *l = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\nWait, but the elements in l can be any integers, but when calculating ans, which is a sum involving their absolute differences, so if the elements are large, the sum can overflow even with long long. But the problem requires the code to behave exactly as the Python code, which uses arbitrary precision integers. However, in practice, the second part's input is the string of ans, so if ans is very large, the second part would output \"No\" regardless. But the problem's test cases may not have such cases, but to be safe, perhaps use long long.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nChange the variables:\n\nint ans = n-1 \u2192 long long ans = n-1;\n\nThe elements in l are read as int, but when calculating the difference, it's okay as long as the difference doesn't overflow. But since in Python, it's handled as integers, but in C, using int may overflow. To prevent that, perhaps read the elements as long long, but the problem's first Python code uses int(input()), which in Python can be any size, but in C, we can read them as long long.\n\nWait, but the problem's first Python code appends the input as integers, so in C, we can read them as int, but if the input numbers are larger than INT_MAX, then scanf would fail. So to handle all possible inputs (as per Python's behavior), we need to read them as long long.\n\nTherefore, changing the code:\n\nUse long long for ans and the elements in l.\n\nSo:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    long long *l = malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &l[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    long long ans = n-1;\n\n    long long last =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        ans += abs(last - l[i]) +1;\n\n        last = l[i];\n\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part.\n\n    char s[21];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    if (len !=4) {\n\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        int counts[256] = {0};\n\n        for (int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n            counts[s[i]]++;\n\n        }\n\n        int count2 =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n            if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n                count2++;\n\n            } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n                count2 = -1; // invalid\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (count2 ==2) {\n\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n        } else {\n\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    free(l);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the elements in l are read as long long, so the scanf format is %lld. Also, the ans is a long long, so when using sprintf, the format is %lld.\n\nThis way, even large numbers can be handled up to the limits of long long. However, if ans exceeds 9999, the second part will output \"No\", which is correct.\n\nThis should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the ans is negative. But in the first part's code, ans starts at n-1 (which is at least 0 when n>=1), and each term added is abs(...) +1, which is non-negative. So ans is always non-negative. So the string will not have a '-'.\n\nThus, the code should be correct now."
