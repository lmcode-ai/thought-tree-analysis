Then, if the elements from index k-1 onwards aren't all the same, it also prints -1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. The main function reads two integers n and k, then a list of elements. It checks if all elements are the same, in which case it prints 0. If k is 1, it prints -1. Then, if the elements from index k-1 onwards aren't all the same, it also prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the target as the last element, creates a list of the first k-1 elements, pops elements from the end if they equal the target, and the length of the remaining list is the answer.\n\nThen File 2 takes the input (which would be the output of File 1?), but wait, no. Wait, the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, the first program's output is the input to the second? Wait, the first program's output is the result of the first computation, and then the second program takes that as input? Wait, but the second program's input is just a string, which it checks for presence of 'A' and 'B'. Wait, but the first program's output is a number (like 0, -1, or the length of to_delete). So how does that connect?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The user says the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input (since it's looking for 'A' and 'B'). That's a problem. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, like 0 or -1 or some integer. So the second program would read that number as a string, but then check if it contains 'A' and 'B'? That would never be true, so the second program would always output \"No\". But maybe the actual input to the second program is different? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe the second program is supposed to process the same input as the first? Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number (like 0, -1, or the length of to_delete). The second program reads that number as a string, and checks if it contains 'A' and 'B'. Since numbers don't have those letters, the second program would always output \"No\". But that seems odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the second program is supposed to process the same input as the first? But the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior. So I have to follow the given code exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program is supposed to process the same input as the first? But according to the problem statement, the first's output is the second's input. So the first program's output is a number, which is then given to the second program as input. The second program then checks if that input (as a string) contains both 'A' and 'B', which it won't. So the second program would output \"No\" unless the first program's output is something like \"AB\" or \"BA\", which it isn't. So the second program's output is always \"No\" in this scenario. But maybe the user intended the second program to process the same input as the first? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to process the same input as the first, but the user's example is just a test case. Anyway, I have to follow the given code as per the problem's instruction. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the C program must first compute the first program's result, then pass that as input to the second's processing.\n\nSo the C program must first read the input for the first program (n, k, and the elements), process it as per the first Python code, then take the output of that (the printed number) and use it as the input to the second Python code's processing. Then output the second's result.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is printed, then the second program reads that output as its input. So the C program must first compute the first part, then take that result (the printed number) and pass it as the input to the second part's processing, then output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first process the first part, then the second part, with the first's output being the input to the second's processing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, k, and the elements array).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic, compute the result (the number to print).\n\n3. Instead of printing it immediately, use that result as the input to the second program's processing.\n\n4. The second program's processing is to check if the input string (the first's output) contains both 'A' and 'B', then output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so when converted to a string, it's like \"0\\n\" or \"-1\\n\" or \"5\\n\". The second program would check if that string has both 'A' and 'B', which it won't. So the second program would output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB\", which it can't be. So the second program's output is always \"No\" in this scenario. But perhaps the user intended the second program to process the same input as the first? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's example. But I have to follow the given code.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first process the first part, compute the first's output, then process the second part using that output as input, then output the second's result.\n\nSo the C program structure would be:\n\n- Read the input for the first part (n, k, elements array).\n\n- Compute the first part's result (the number to print).\n\n- Then, take that number as a string (the output of the first program), and process it through the second program's logic.\n\n- Finally, output the second program's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nFirst, the first part's logic.\n\nLet me re-express the first Python code in C.\n\nFirst, the first part's steps:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read n elements into an array.\n\nCheck if all elements are the same. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, if k ==1, output -1.\n\nElse, check if the elements from index k-1 to end are all the same. If not, output -1.\n\nElse, the target is the last element. The to_delete array is the first k-1 elements. Then, while the last element of to_delete is equal to target, pop it. The answer is the length of to_delete after popping.\n\nSo in C, I need to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the elements array.\n\nCheck all same:\n\nLoop through all elements, check if they are equal to the first element.\n\nIf all same, then the first part's output is 0.\n\nElse, check if k is 1: output -1.\n\nElse, check the elements from index k-1 to end. Are they all the same?\n\nWait, in Python, the slice is elems[k-1:], which is from index k-1 to the end.\n\nSo in C, starting at index (k-1), check all elements from there to the end. If any of them is different from the first element in that slice (i.e., the first element at index k-1), then the condition is not met, so output -1.\n\nWait, the code says \"if not all_same(elems[k-1:])\", so if those elements are not all the same, then output -1.\n\nSo in C, for the elements from index (k-1) to n-1, check if they are all the same. If not, then output -1.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, target is the last element (elems[-1] in Python is the last element).\n\nThe to_delete array is the first k-1 elements. So in C, the first k-1 elements of the array.\n\nThen, while the to_delete array is not empty and the last element is equal to target, remove it (pop from end).\n\nThe length of the remaining array is the answer.\n\nSo in C, we can represent the to_delete as an array of size k-1, but since we need to pop elements from the end, perhaps we can track the current length.\n\nWait, in C, arrays are fixed size, but perhaps we can use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, since the to_delete is the first k-1 elements, and we need to count how many elements are left after removing trailing elements equal to target.\n\nSo the to_delete array is the first (k-1) elements. Let's say the array is called arr, then to_delete is arr[0] to arr[k-2].\n\nWe can loop from the end of this subarray backwards, counting how many elements are equal to target, until we hit a different one. The number of elements to keep is (original length) minus the count of trailing elements equal to target.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to start with the length as (k-1), then iterate from the end of the to_delete array (i.e., index (k-2) down to 0) and decrement the length as long as the current element is equal to target.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize length = k-1.\n\nThen, while (length > 0) and (arr[length-1] == target), subtract 1 from length.\n\nSo the final length is the answer.\n\nYes, that's better. So in C, we can do that.\n\nNow, the second part of the code (the second Python file) takes the first program's output (the number printed) as input, then checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so when converted to a string, it's like \"0\", \"-1\", \"5\", etc. So the second program's input is that string. Since those strings don't contain 'A' or 'B', the result is always \"No\".\n\nBut the code must be translated as per the given code. So the second part's processing is to take the first's output (as a string) and check for presence of 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo in C, after computing the first part's result (the number), we need to convert that number to a string, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but in C, converting the number to a string can be done via sprintf. So for example, if the first part's result is stored in an integer variable 'result1', then we can create a string buffer, say char str[20], and sprintf(str, \"%d\", result1). Then, check if 'A' and 'B' are present in that string.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is printed with a newline, but in the second program's input, the input is read via input() which in Python reads until the newline. So the second program's input is the entire output of the first, including the newline? Or does it ignore the newline? Well, in Python, input() reads a line from input, stripping the trailing newline. So the string s in the second program is the first's output without the newline.\n\nTherefore, in C, when converting the first's result to a string, we can just write the number as a string without a newline, then check for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read n and k from stdin.\n\n2. Read n integers into an array.\n\n3. Process the first part's logic to compute the first result (the number to print).\n\n4. Convert that number to a string.\n\n5. Process the second part's logic on that string to get the final output.\n\n6. Print the final output (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, handling the first part.\n\nImplementing the first part's logic in C.\n\nFirst, read n and k:\n\nWe can read them using scanf. But need to make sure that the input is properly read. The first line is two integers separated by space. The second line is n integers separated by spaces.\n\nSo code:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\n    int arr[n]; // assuming C99 or later for variable-length arrays.\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Now process the first part.\n\n    // Check if all elements are same.\n\n    int allSame = 1;\n    if (n > 0) {\n        int first = arr[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (arr[i] != first) {\n                allSame = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    int result1;\n    if (allSame) {\n        result1 = 0;\n    } else {\n        if (k == 1) {\n            result1 = -1;\n        } else {\n            // Check if elements from k-1 to end are all same.\n\n            int start = k-1;\n            if (start >= n) { // if k-1 >=n, then the slice is empty? but n is at least 1 (since allSame was false)\n                // but in that case, the elements from k-1 to end would be empty, so all_same is vacuously true? Not sure. Need to think.\n\n                // Wait, in Python, if the slice is empty (like when k-1 >=n), then all_same would return True (since the list is empty, but the function returns all([x == arr[0] for x in arr]). Wait, but if the list is empty, then the list comprehension is empty, so all() returns True. Wait, in Python, all([]) is True? No, wait, all() of an empty list is True only if all elements are true, but since there are none, it's considered True. Wait, no: in Python, all() returns True if all elements are true, or the list is empty. Wait, no, actually, all() returns True if every element is true, or the iterable is empty. So for an empty list, all() returns True. So in the case where the slice is empty (start >=n), then all_same would return True (since the list is empty). So in that case, the condition (if not all_same(elems[k-1:])) would be false, so proceed.\n\n                // So in C, for the elements from start to end (indices start to n-1):\n\n                // if start >=n, then the elements are none, so allSame2 is true.\n\n                int allSame2 = 1;\n                if (start < n) {\n                    int first_part = arr[start];\n                    for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\n                        if (arr[i] != first_part) {\n                            allSame2 = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (!allSame2) {\n                    result1 = -1;\n                } else {\n                    // proceed\n                    int target = arr[n-1]; // last element\n                    int to_delete_length = k-1;\n                    // Now check trailing elements equal to target in the first k-1 elements.\n\n                    // We need to find the first element from the end of the first k-1 elements that is not equal to target.\n\n                    // Start from the end of the to_delete array (index k-2) and go backward.\n\n                    while (to_delete_length > 0 && arr[to_delete_length -1] == target) {\n                        to_delete_length--;\n                    }\n                    result1 = to_delete_length;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nWait, but in the code above, the part where start is k-1. So when start is beyond n-1, then the elements from start to end are none, so allSame2 is true. So in that case, the code proceeds to compute the target and the to_delete_length.\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, when the slice is empty (like when k is larger than n?), then the all_same would return True (since the list is empty), so the code proceeds.\n\nSo in C, the code for the second part (after checking k !=1):\n\nWe need to check if the elements from start (k-1) to end are all same.\n\nSo:\n\nint start = k-1;\n\nint allSame2 = 1;\n\nif (start < n) { // if start is within the array\n\n    int first_part = arr[start];\n\n    for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] != first_part) {\n\n            allSame2 = 0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    // the slice is empty, so allSame2 is true (since all() of empty list is True)\n\n    allSame2 = 1;\n\n}\n\nif (!allSame2) {\n\n    result1 = -1;\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    // proceed to compute target and to_delete_length.\n\n    int target = arr[n-1];\n\n    int to_delete_length = k-1;\n\n    while (to_delete_length >0 && arr[to_delete_length -1] == target) {\n\n        to_delete_length--;\n\n    }\n\n    result1 = to_delete_length;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'else' part after checking allSame2 is 0 or not.\n\nWait, the code in Python is:\n\nif not all_same(elems[k-1:]):\n\n    print(-1)\n\n    return\n\nSo in C, if allSame2 is 0 (meaning the elements are not all same), then we set result1 to -1 and break.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo the code above is correct.\n\nNow, putting all that into the C code.\n\nNow, after computing result1, we need to process the second part.\n\nThe second part's code is:\n\nstdin = input()\n\ns = stdin\n\nresult = \"Yes\" if \"A\" in s and \"B\" in s else \"No\"\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo in C, the input to the second part is the string representation of result1. So we need to convert result1 to a string, then check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is printed as an integer, so the string is the digits of the number. So the second part's input is that string. Since numbers don't have 'A' or 'B', the result will always be \"No\".\n\nBut the code must be translated as per the given code.\n\nSo in C:\n\nWe can create a string buffer for the first result.\n\nchar str[20]; // enough to hold up to 2^64 which is 20 digits.\n\nsprintf(str, \"%d\", result1);\n\nThen, check if 'A' and 'B' are present in str.\n\nint hasA = 0, hasB =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    if (str[i] == 'A') hasA =1;\n\n    if (str[i] == 'B') hasB =1;\n\n}\n\nif (hasA && hasB) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the second Python code, the input is read as a string, which includes any leading or trailing whitespace? Well, in Python, input() reads a line, stripping the trailing newline. So the string s is exactly the first program's output (without the newline). So converting the integer to a string with sprintf as above is correct.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nWhat if k is 0? But in the first Python code, k is read as an integer. But in the problem's first code, the input is split into two integers, so k can be 0? But in the code, when k is 1, it returns -1. But if k is 0, then in the code, when checking k ==1, it's not, so proceeds to check the elements from k-1 (which is -1) to end. That would be a problem in Python, but in C, when start is negative, the code for allSame2 would have start <n (since n is at least 1?), but start is -1, so the loop would run from i = -1, which is invalid. Wait, in the code above, when start is k-1, if k is 0, then start is -1. Then in the code for allSame2:\n\nstart = -1.\n\nThen, in the code:\n\nif (start < n) { which is true (since -1 < n), then first_part is arr[start], which is arr[-1], which in C is an invalid index. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but in the first Python code, the input is n and k. The problem probably expects that k is between 1 and n, but the code may not have such checks. So in C, we need to handle cases where k is 0 or larger than n.\n\nHmm, but according to the first Python code, when k is 0, then the code would have k-1 = -1, so the slice is from -1 to end, which in Python is the same as starting from 0 (since negative indices wrap around). Wait, in Python, arr[-1] is the last element, but a slice like arr[-1:] would be the last element. However, a slice like arr[-2:] would be the last two elements. But a slice like arr[-1:0] would be empty? Wait, in Python, the start is -1 (the last element), and end is 0, so the slice is from the last element to index 0 (exclusive), which is empty. So the all_same would return True (since the list is empty). So in that case, the code would proceed.\n\nBut in C, when k is 0, then start is -1, so in the code:\n\nstart = -1.\n\nThen, in the code for allSame2:\n\nfirst_part = arr[start], which is arr[-1], which is invalid in C. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, in C, we need to handle when start is negative.\n\nWait, in the code for allSame2:\n\nif (start < n) {\n\n    first_part = arr[start];\n\n    ... loop from start to n-1.\n\n}\n\nBut if start is negative, then arr[start] is invalid. So we need to adjust the code.\n\nWait, in the case when start is negative (k-1 <0), then the slice in Python is from 0 to end? Or how does Python handle negative start indices in slices?\n\nWait, in Python, the slice arr[start:end], if start is negative, it counts from the end. For example, arr[-1] is the last element. But for a slice like arr[-2:3], it would start at the second last element and go up to index 3 (exclusive). But if start is negative and less than zero, like -5, then it's treated as 0. Wait, no, in Python, the start is clamped to the array's length. Wait, no, actually, in Python, negative indices in slices are allowed but they are treated as starting from the end. So for example, arr[-3:5] would start at the third element from the end, but if the array is shorter than that, it would start at 0. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in Python, the start is computed as max(start, 0) if start is negative? Not exactly. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the array has 5 elements (indices 0-4). Then arr[-6:3] would start at index 0 (since -6 is less than 0), so the slice is from 0 to 3 (exclusive), so elements 0,1,2.\n\nSo in the case where start is negative (k-1 <0), then the slice starts at 0. So in C, when start is negative, the start is set to 0.\n\nWait, in the first Python code, when k is 0, then k-1 is -1, so the slice is arr[-1:], which is the last element. So the elements from index -1 to end (which is the last element). So the slice is [arr[-1]], so all_same would check if all elements are same (they are, so allSame2 is true).\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, when k is 0, then the first part's code would proceed as follows:\n\nallSame is false (since we are in the else clause).\n\nk is not 1, so proceed to check the elements from k-1 (which is -1) to end.\n\nThe slice is arr[-1:], which is the last element. So allSame2 is true (since only one element). So then proceed to compute target (last element), and to_delete_length is k-1 = -1, but that's a problem because k-1 is -1, so to_delete_length is -1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, in the first Python code, when k is 0, then the code would have:\n\nto_delete = elems[0: k-1] \u2192 which is 0 to -2 (since k-1 is -1, so the slice is up to -1 (exclusive?), so the slice is from 0 to -2, which in Python is an empty list. Because in Python, a slice like a[0:-1] is up to but not including -1 (the last element). So a[0:-1] is all elements except last. But a[0:-2] is up to second last. So when k is 0, the slice is 0 to -1 (since k-1 is -1, so the end is k-1, which is -1. So the slice is 0 to -1 (exclusive?), which would be up to -2? Not sure. Let me think:\n\nIn Python, the slice a[start:end], when end is negative, it's counted from the end. So for example, a[0:-1] is all elements except last. So if start is 0 and end is -1, then the slice is from 0 to len(a)-1 -1 (since end is -1 \u2192 len(a) + end \u2192 len(a) -1). So the slice is up to (but not including) the last element.\n\nWait, in the case where k is 0, then the slice for to_delete is 0 to k-1 (which is -1). So the slice is 0 to -1 (exclusive). So the slice is from 0 to (len(arr) -1) -1? Not sure, but in any case, the slice would be empty? Because 0 to -1 (exclusive) would be up to the second last element, but if the array has elements, then it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps in the case of k=0, the code would have to_delete_length = k-1 = -1, which is invalid. So in the first Python code, when k is 0, the code would have to_delete_length = -1, which would be problematic in the loop.\n\nBut in the original Python code, when k is 0, the code would have:\n\nto_delete = elems[0: -1] (since k-1 is -1). So the slice is from 0 to -1 (exclusive), which is all elements except the last one. Wait, no, 0 to -1 is up to the last element (since -1 is the last index). So the slice would be all elements except the last one. Wait, no, the end is exclusive. So a[0:-1] is all elements except last.\n\nWait, but in the code, when k is 0, the code would have:\n\nto_delete_length = k-1 \u2192 -1. Which is invalid, so the code would have a problem.\n\nBut in the original Python code, when k is 0, the code would have:\n\nto_delete = elems[0: -1], which is a valid slice (if the array has at least one element). The length of that slice is (n-1) elements (since from 0 to -1 (exclusive) is n-1 elements).\n\nWait, but in the code, the to_delete_length is set to k-1, which is -1, which is wrong. Wait, no, in the code, the to_delete is the first k-1 elements. Wait, in Python, the slice [0:k-1] when k is 0 would be [0:-1], which is all elements except the last. So the length is n-1. But in the code, to_delete_length is set to k-1 (which is -1), which is wrong. So there's a bug in the original Python code when k is 0?\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code expects that k is at least 1. Because in the first part, when k is 1, it returns -1. So maybe the problem's input constraints ensure that k is at least 1. So perhaps in the C code, we can assume that k is at least 1, but the code should handle it properly.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, when k is 0, the code would have to_delete_length = -1, which would cause the loop to run while (to_delete_length >0) \u2192 no, so the loop doesn't run, and the result is -1. But that's not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code has a bug here, but since the problem says to translate the code as is, we have to replicate it exactly.\n\nIn the C code, when k is 0, then in the first part's code:\n\nAfter the allSame check (which is false), then since k !=1, proceed to check the elements from start = k-1 = -1 to end.\n\nIn the code for allSame2:\n\nstart is -1, so in the code:\n\nif (start < n) \u2192 yes, since -1 < n.\n\nfirst_part = arr[start] \u2192 which is arr[-1], which is invalid in C (since arrays are 0-based and negative indices are invalid).\n\nSo this is a problem. To handle this, perhaps in C, when start is negative, we need to set start to 0, but that would change the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code, when start is negative, the slice is from 0 to end, so the code should treat start as 0 in that case.\n\nWait, in Python, when the start is negative, the slice starts at that position from the end. So for example, if the array has 5 elements, and start is -3, then the start is index 2 (since 5 + (-3) = 2). So in C, to replicate that, when start is negative, we can compute start as (n + start) if start <0, but only if that is >=0. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, but in the case of start = -1 (k=0), then in Python, the start is the last element (index n-1). So the slice is from n-1 to end (so just the last element). So in C, when start is negative, we can compute the actual start index as (start <0 ? (n + start) : start). But only if (n + start) >=0. Else, it's 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nstart = k-1;\n\nif (start <0) {\n\n    start = 0; // because in Python, a negative start would start from the end, but if it's too negative, it wraps to 0?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the array has 5 elements (indices 0-4). If start is -6, then in Python, the start is 0 (since -6 is less than -5, so it's treated as 0). So the slice would start at 0.\n\nSo in C, when start is negative, we can set start to max(start, 0).\n\nWait, but in Python, the start is computed as (start if start >=0 else len(arr)+start). But if that is negative, it's set to 0.\n\nWait, the actual Python logic for slice indices is:\n\nThe start is clamped to the range [0, len(arr)].\n\nWait, according to Python's slice handling:\n\nThe start is computed as (start if start is not None else 0). Then, if start <0, it is added to the length. If the result is <0, it is set to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nstart = k-1;\n\nif (start <0) {\n\n    start += n;\n\n    if (start <0) {\n\n        start =0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, in the code for allSame2, when start is negative, we can set start to 0, because in Python, a negative start that is too small would start at 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input ensures that k is at least 1, so we can ignore this case. But since the code must be translated exactly, we have to handle it.\n\nAlternatively, in the code for allSame2:\n\nif (start <0) {\n\n    start =0;\n\n}\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut this may not be exactly what Python does, but perhaps it's the best we can do in C without complicating.\n\nAlternatively, in the code for allSame2:\n\nif (start <0) {\n\n    start =0;\n\n}\n\nif (start >=n) {\n\n    allSame2 =1;\n\n} else {\n\n    first_part = arr[start];\n\n    ... loop.\n\n}\n\nSo that way, when start is negative, it's set to 0, and then check if start is within the array.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo modifying the code for allSame2:\n\nint start = k-1;\n\nif (start <0) {\n\n    start =0;\n\n}\n\nif (start >=n) {\n\n    allSame2 =1;\n\n} else {\n\n    first_part = arr[start];\n\n    for (int i = start; i <n; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] != first_part) {\n\n            allSame2 =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where start is set to 0, but the original Python code would have a different start (like -1 \u2192 n-1). So this approach may not be accurate.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects that k is at least 1, so we can proceed under that assumption, and the code will handle it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code has a bug when k is 0, but since the problem says to translate it as is, we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code, when k is 0, the code would have to_delete_length = k-1 = -1, which would be problematic in the loop.\n\nIn the code for to_delete_length:\n\nto_delete_length = k-1;\n\nif (k is 0, then to_delete_length is -1.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\nwhile (to_delete_length >0 && ... )\n\nSince to_delete_length is -1, the loop doesn't run, so the result is -1.\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, when k is 0, the code would have:\n\nto_delete = elems[0: -1], which is the first n-1 elements. The length is n-1.\n\nThen, while the last element of to_delete (which is the (n-2)th element of the original array) is equal to target (the last element), we pop it.\n\nWait, but in the code, the to_delete_length is set to k-1 (which is -1), which is wrong. So the code has a bug here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the original code may have a bug when k is 0, but since the problem requires translating it as is, perhaps we can proceed with the code as written, even if it has bugs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is intended for k >=1, so we can proceed.\n\nAssuming that k is at least 1, then the code can proceed.\n\nNow, proceeding to code.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n    int arr[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n    }\n\n    int allSame = 1;\n    if (n > 0) {\n        int first = arr[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (arr[i] != first) {\n                allSame = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    int result1;\n    if (allSame) {\n        result1 = 0;\n    } else {\n        if (k == 1) {\n            result1 = -1;\n        } else {\n            int start = k - 1;\n            int allSame2 = 1;\n            if (start < 0) {\n                start = 0;\n            }\n            if (start >= n) {\n                allSame2 = 1;\n            } else {\n                int first_part = arr[start];\n                for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\n                    if (arr[i] != first_part) {\n                        allSame2 = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (!allSame2) {\n                result1 = -1;\n            } else {\n                int target = arr[n - 1];\n                int to_delete_length = k - 1;\n                while (to_delete_length > 0 && arr[to_delete_length - 1] == target) {\n                    to_delete_length--;\n                }\n                result1 = to_delete_length;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part\n    char str[20];\n    sprintf(str, \"%d\", result1);\n    int hasA = 0, hasB = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        if (str[i] == 'A') hasA = 1;\n        if (str[i] == 'B') hasB = 1;\n    }\n    if (hasA && hasB) {\n        printf(\"Yes\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where k is 0, the code may have issues, but according to the problem's code, it's handled as per the original.\n\nNow, testing some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3 2\n\n1 2 2\n\nFirst program's steps:\n\nAll elements not same (1,2,2). k=2 !=1.\n\nCheck elements from index 1 (k-1=1) to end (indices 1 and 2). They are 2 and 2 \u2192 all same. So proceed.\n\nTarget is 2.\n\nto_delete is first k-1=1 elements \u2192 [1].\n\nCheck trailing elements equal to target (2). The last element of to_delete is 1 !=2 \u2192 so to_delete_length remains 1. So result1 is 1.\n\nSecond part: the string is \"1\", which has no A or B \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nSo the final output is \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs \"-1\".\n\nInput:\n\n3 1\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 k=1.\n\nFirst program's output is -1.\n\nSecond part's input is \"-1\" \u2192 no A/B \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs 0.\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n2 2 2 \u2192 all same \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond part: \"0\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs 0 because all elements are same.\n\nAnother case where the first program's output is \"AB\" (but that's impossible, so second part always \"No\").\n\nThus, the code should work as per the original.\n\nNow, check the code for possible errors.\n\nIn the code for to_delete_length:\n\nto_delete_length is initialized to k-1. But when k is 0, that's -1. The loop condition is while (to_delete_length >0 ...), so the loop doesn't run. The result is -1 (since in the code, when allSame2 is true, then the code proceeds to compute to_delete_length and sets result1 to that. But if k is 0, then to_delete_length is -1, so result1 is -1. But in the original code, when k is 0, the code would have to_delete_length = k-1 = -1, which is wrong. But since the problem requires translating the code as is, this is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the to_delete array is empty (k-1 is 0), then to_delete_length is 0, and the loop doesn't run. So the result is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when the first k-1 elements are all target, then the loop reduces to_delete_length to 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
