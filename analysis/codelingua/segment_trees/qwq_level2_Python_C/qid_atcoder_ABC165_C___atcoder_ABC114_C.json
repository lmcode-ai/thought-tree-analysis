So total is 0 (from 0) + (0 from 7) + (1 from 5) + (1 from 3) \u2192 total 2. So correct. Thus, the code should work. Another test case for the first problem:\n\nN=1, M=5, Q=0. Then the max_score is 0. The second problem's N is 0, so count_357(0,0) \u2192 0. Another case where the first problem's output is 0, so the second problem's count is 0.",

But since it's recursive, each call would need to pass those parameters along. Hmm, this complicates the function signature. Alternatively, make a, b, c, d and Q global variables. Since in C, variables declared outside any function are global. So perhaps:\n\nint a[];\nint b [];\nint c[];\nint d [];\nint Q; But since the size is variable, that's not possible. So perhaps using pointers and dynamically allocated arrays, and making them global. Wait, here's an idea:\n\nDeclare pointers to the arrays as global variables:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint Q;\n\nThen, in main, after reading Q, allocate the arrays and read the values into them. Then, the backtrack function can access these global variables. This way, the backtrack function doesn't need to pass these parameters each time. So modifying the code:\n\nGlobal variables:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint Q;\n\nThen in main:\n\n    a = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    b = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    c = malloc(Q * sizeof(int)); d = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a[i], &b[i], &c[i], &d[i]);\n\n    }\n\nThen, the backtrack function can access a, b, c, d, and Q.\n\nThis approach would work. So the backtrack function can be written as:\n\nvoid backtrack(int current_sequence[], int current_length, int last_val, int *max_score) {\n\n    if (current_length == N) {\n\n        int score =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n            int a_val = a[i] -1;\n\n            int b_val = b[i] -1; if (current_sequence[b_val] - current_sequence[a_val] == c[i]) {\n\n                score += d[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (score > *max_score) {\n\n            *max_score = score;\n\n        }\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int next_val = last_val; next_val <= M; next_val++) {\n\n        current_sequence[current_length] = next_val;\n\n        backtrack(current_sequence, current_length +1, next_val, max_score);\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, but N is also needed here. So N must be a global variable as well. Hmm, so adding N and M as global variables. So the global variables would be:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint N, M, Q; Thus, in main, after reading N, M, Q, assign them to the global variables. Wait, but in C, variables declared outside any function are global. So:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint N, M, Q;\n\nThen in main:\n\nscanf(\"%d % d %d\", &N, &M, &Q); So the global variables N, M, Q are set. Thus, the backtrack function can access them.",

So that's correct. Now, putting all together.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each file does.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It's a Python script that reads input for some problem, probably involving constraints with N, M, Q, and lists a, b, c, d. The solve function uses a recursive approach (rec) to generate all sequences A of length N where each element is at least the previous one (non-decreasing). For each such sequence, it checks the Q conditions and calculates a score, keeping the maximum. The main function reads the input and calls solve.\n\nThen File 2 is another Python script that takes an integer N as input and counts numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits that are \u2264 N. The function aaa is recursive, building numbers by appending 7,5,3 and checking if they are within the limit.\n\nBut the user says these are to be executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. Wait, that's a problem. Because the first Python file's output is the result of the first problem, and the second takes N as input. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. But how?\n\nWait, the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the C program must first run the first problem's logic, get its result, then use that result as the N for the second problem, then output the second's result.\n\nSo the C program must first process the first problem's input, compute its result (the maximum score), then use that result as the N for the second problem, compute the count of 357 numbers \u2264 that N, and output that count.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first read the input for the first problem, compute the first result, then use that result as the input N for the second problem, compute the second result, and output that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the first problem's input (N, M, Q, then Q triplets a, b, c, d, and d? Wait, looking at the first Python code:\n\nWait in the first file's solve function, the parameters are N, M, Q, a, b, c, d. The a, b, c, d are lists of length Q. The main function reads N, M, Q, then for each of Q lines, reads a[i], b[i], c[i], d[i].\n\nSo the first program's input is:\n\nFirst line: N M Q\n\nThen Q lines each with four integers a, b, c, d.\n\nThe first program's output is the maximum score from the sequences.\n\nThen the second program takes that output as its N, and computes the count of numbers made of 3,5,7 digits that are \u2264 that N.\n\nSo the C program must first process the first problem's input, compute the first result (the maximum score), then use that as N for the second problem, compute the count, and output that count.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the first problem's input (as per the first Python code).\n\n- Compute the first problem's result (the maximum score).\n\n- Then, take that result as N for the second problem.\n\n- Compute the second problem's result (the count of 357 numbers \u2264 N).\n\n- Output that count.\n\nNow, translating this into C.\n\nFirst, the first part: the first problem's code.\n\nThe first problem's code uses a recursive approach. But in C, recursion might be tricky for large N and M. Let's see what constraints are possible. The first problem's code uses a recursive backtracking approach to generate all non-decreasing sequences of length N where each element is between 1 and M. For each such sequence, it checks the Q conditions and accumulates the points. The maximum is tracked.\n\nThe recursion in the first Python code is implemented with the function rec(A), which builds the sequence A step by step. The base case is when the length of A is N. Then, for each step, the next number can be from the last element (or 1 if it's the first) up to M.\n\nIn C, recursion depth could be an issue. Let's see: the maximum N for the first problem? Well, in the first problem's code, the recursion depth is N. So if N is up to, say, 10, then it's manageable. But if N is larger, like 20, then stack overflow could occur. But since the problem is from a programming contest, perhaps the constraints are small. Let's assume that N is small enough for recursion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe an iterative approach would be better, but since the original uses recursion, perhaps we can proceed with recursion in C.\n\nNow, the first problem's code in C:\n\nWe need to read N, M, Q, then Q entries of a, b, c, d.\n\nThen, perform the backtracking.\n\nThe variables in the first problem's code:\n\nThe solve function has a res variable that's nonlocal. In C, we can use a pointer to track the maximum.\n\nThe recursive function in C would need to track the current sequence, the current position, and the current maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since the sequence is non-decreasing, perhaps we can represent it as an array, and track the current length.\n\nLet me think of the structure.\n\nThe first problem's solve function in C:\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes the current array, its length, and the current maximum value. The base case is when the length is N. Then, check all Q conditions and update the maximum score.\n\nWait, but in the original code, for each sequence A of length N, they loop through all Q queries and check if A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]. If so, add d[i] to the score. Then keep the maximum.\n\nSo in C, for each generated sequence, we need to compute the score.\n\nThe problem is that for each sequence, we have to loop through all Q conditions. So for large Q and large N, this could be slow, but again, assuming the constraints are manageable.\n\nSo, in C, the first part's code would need to:\n\n- Read N, M, Q, then the Q a, b, c, d values.\n\n- Initialize the maximum score to 0.\n\n- Then perform a recursive backtracking to generate all non-decreasing sequences of length N, each element between 1 and M, with each element >= previous.\n\n- For each such sequence, compute the score, and update the maximum.\n\nNow, the second problem's code is a recursive function that counts numbers made of 3,5,7 digits that are <= N. The function aaa(n) is called with '0' initially, and builds numbers by appending 7,5,3. The base case is when the number exceeds N, returns 0. Otherwise, check if all digits are 3,5,7 (since the way it's built, they are, but the first check is redundant?), then add 1 if so, plus the recursive calls for appending each digit.\n\nWait in the Python code:\n\ndef aaa(n):\n\n    if int(n) > N:\n\n        return 0\n\n    ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'} else 0\n\n    for i in '753':\n\n        ans += aaa(n + i)\n\n    return ans\n\nWait, but n is a string here. Because when you start with '0', then adding '7' gives '07', but when converted to int, that's 7. So the function builds numbers by appending digits, starting from 0, but the first step is adding 7,5,3 to '0', resulting in '07', '05', '03', but when converted to int, those are 7,5,3. So the initial '0' is just a starting point, and the actual numbers are built by appending digits. The first check is whether the current number (as integer) is <= N. Then, the second check is whether all digits are 3,5,7. But since the function only appends those digits, the set check is redundant. Because the way the function is built, the number can only consist of 3,5,7 digits. So the set check is redundant, but perhaps included for safety.\n\nBut in the code, the first check is if the number exceeds N, return 0. Then, the ans is 1 if the digits are all 3,5,7 (which they are, since the function only appends those digits). So the ans is 1 plus the sum of the recursive calls. Wait, but the function is called with n starting as '0', which when converted to int is 0. The set of digits would be {'0'}, which is not in the allowed set, so the ans would be 0. But then the function proceeds to add 7,5,3 to '0', leading to '07', '05', '03', which when converted to integers are 7,5,3. So the first call to aaa('0') would return 0 (since 0's digits are not allowed) plus the sum of the three recursive calls. So the initial '0' is not counted, but the numbers built from there are.\n\nTherefore, the function correctly counts all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits that are <= N.\n\nIn C, the second part can be implemented with a recursive function. The N here is the result of the first problem's output.\n\nSo the C program must first compute the first problem's result (max_score), then compute the count of 357 numbers <= max_score, and output that count.\n\nNow, putting it all together in C.\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nWe need to read N, M, Q, then the Q a, b, c, d values.\n\nThen, perform the backtracking to find the maximum score.\n\nThen, use that max_score as N for the second problem.\n\nThen compute the count via the second problem's logic.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFor the first problem's data:\n\nWe can read N, M, Q, then read Q entries of a, b, c, d. Since in C, arrays are fixed size, we need to read Q first, then allocate arrays. But since in the first Python code, the a, b, c, d arrays are of size Q, we can do the same in C.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint N, M, Q;\n\nint a[Q], b[Q], c[Q], d[Q]; // but Q is variable, so we need to read Q first.\n\nWait, but in C, you can't have variable-length arrays unless using C99. So perhaps we can read Q first, then use dynamic allocation. Alternatively, assuming that Q is not too big, but the problem may have constraints. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first problem's code can be handled with a helper function that uses recursion.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part in C:\n\nRead N, M, Q.\n\nThen read Q lines, each with four integers. So for each i from 0 to Q-1, read a[i], b[i], c[i], d[i].\n\nThen, perform the backtracking.\n\nThe backtracking function can be a recursive function that builds the current sequence, and tracks the current maximum.\n\nThe maximum score can be a global variable, or passed by reference.\n\nLet me think of the backtracking function.\n\nWe can represent the current sequence as an array of integers, say, current_sequence, and a current_length. The next number must be >= the last element (or 1 if current_length is 0).\n\nThe base case is when current_length == N. Then, compute the score for this sequence.\n\nTo compute the score, loop through all Q queries, check if the difference between b[i]-1 and a[i]-1 (since Python uses 0-based, but in the code, the a and b are stored as per the input, which is 1-based in the problem's terms). Wait in the Python code, the a and b are stored as per the input, which are 1-based indices. So in the code, when accessing A[b[i]-1] and A[a[i]-1], so in C, the same applies.\n\nSo for each query i from 0 to Q-1:\n\nif (current_sequence[b[i]-1] - current_sequence[a[i]-1] == c[i]) then add d[i] to the score.\n\nThen, compare with the global maximum.\n\nSo the steps for the backtracking function:\n\nParameters: current_sequence, current_length, last_value (the last element in the sequence, to avoid recomputing it each time), and the current maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the parameters can be the current_sequence array, the current_length, and the last_value (the last element in the sequence). The function can be called recursively, building the sequence step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the sequence must be non-decreasing, the next element can be from last_value to M.\n\nSo the function could be something like:\n\nvoid backtrack(int current_sequence[], int current_length, int last_val, int *max_score) {\n\n    if (current_length == N) {\n\n        // compute the score for this sequence\n\n        int score = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {\n\n            int a_val = a[i] - 1;\n\n            int b_val = b[i] - 1;\n\n            if (current_sequence[b_val] - current_sequence[a_val] == c[i]) {\n\n                score += d[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (score > *max_score) {\n\n            *max_score = score;\n\n        }\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    // choose next number from last_val to M\n\n    for (int next_val = last_val; next_val <= M; next_val++) {\n\n        current_sequence[current_length] = next_val;\n\n        backtrack(current_sequence, current_length + 1, next_val, max_score);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in C, arrays are passed by pointer, so the current_sequence can be passed as a pointer. The initial call would start with current_length 0, and last_val 1 (since first element can be 1 to M). Wait, no: the first element can be from 1 to M, but the next elements must be >= previous. So the first call's last_val is 1? Wait, no. The first element can be any from 1 to M. Wait, the first element's next_val can start at 1, and the loop runs from 1 to M. Then, for the next elements, the next_val starts at the previous value.\n\nWait, the initial call would be:\n\ncurrent_sequence is an array of size N.\n\ncurrent_length is 0.\n\nlast_val is 1? Or 0?\n\nWait, in the first step, the first element can be any value between 1 and M. So the loop for next_val starts at 1 (since last_val is 1 if current_length is 0? Wait, perhaps the initial call's last_val is 1, but that's not correct. Wait, the first element can be 1, 2, ..., M. So the loop for next_val should start at 1 (since last_val is 1 when current_length is 0? Or perhaps the last_val is 1 when current_length is 0, but that's not correct. Wait, the first element can be any value between 1 and M. So the initial call's last_val is 1? No, that would restrict the first element to start at 1, but the first element can be any from 1 to M. Wait, perhaps the last_val is 1 when current_length is 0, but that's not correct. Wait, the first element can be any value between 1 and M. So the first call's last_val is 1, but then the loop runs from 1 to M. So that's okay. Because the first element can be 1, 2, ..., M. So the loop from 1 to M is correct.\n\nWait, the code in the Python's rec function:\n\nlast_max = 1 if len(A) == 0 else A[-1]\n\nSo for the first element (when A is empty), the next can start at 1. So yes, the first element can be 1 to M. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the initial call to backtrack would be with current_length 0, last_val 1 (since len(A) is 0, so last_max is 1). Wait, but in the code, the first element can be 1 to M. So the loop starts at 1, and goes up to M. So that's correct.\n\nSo the initial call would be:\n\nint current_sequence[N]; // array to hold the current sequence.\n\nint max_score = 0;\n\nbacktrack(current_sequence, 0, 1, &max_score);\n\nWait, but the current_sequence array needs to be of size N. So in C, we can declare it as an array of size N, but N is a variable. So we need to use dynamic allocation.\n\nAh, right. Since N is read from input, we can't have a static array. So we need to allocate memory for current_sequence.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nint *current_sequence = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nThen, after using it, free it.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, the first problem's code in C:\n\nRead N, M, Q.\n\nRead the Q a, b, c, d values.\n\nInitialize max_score to 0.\n\nCall backtrack with current_sequence (initialized to 0?), but actually, the backtrack function will fill it as it goes.\n\nWait, the backtrack function will set current_sequence[current_length] to next_val each time.\n\nSo the initial call would be:\n\nbacktrack(current_sequence, 0, 1, &max_score);\n\nThen, after that, the max_score holds the result.\n\nNow, the second problem's code.\n\nThe second problem's function is recursive, but in C, recursion can be used here as well. The function counts the numbers made of 3,5,7 digits that are <= N (the first problem's result).\n\nThe function can be written as:\n\nint count_357(int current_num, int max_N) {\n\n    if (current_num > max_N) {\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    // Check if all digits are 3,5,7.\n\n    // Since we build the number by appending only those digits, this is redundant, but let's check.\n\n    int valid = 1;\n\n    int temp = current_num;\n\n    while (temp > 0) {\n\n        int digit = temp % 10;\n\n        if (digit != 3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n\n            valid = 0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n        temp /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = valid ? 1 : 0;\n\n    // Append 7,5,3 and recurse.\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +7, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +5, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +3, max_N);\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the initial call is with current_num starting at 0? Let's see.\n\nIn the Python code, the initial call is aaa('0'), which is 0. But in the code, the first check is if 0 > N? So if N is 0, then it returns 0. But the valid check for 0's digits (which is '0') would not be in the set, so ans is 0. Then, the recursive calls start with 07 (7), 05 (5), 03 (3). So the function correctly builds numbers starting from 3,5,7 digits.\n\nWait, but in the C function above, starting with current_num =0:\n\ncurrent_num is 0, which is <= max_N (the first problem's result). Then, check if all digits are 3,5,7. 0's digits are 0, so not valid. So ans is 0. Then, the recursive calls are 0*10+7=7, 0*10+5=5, 0*10+3=3. So those are the first steps, which is correct.\n\nThus, the initial call would be count_357(0, max_score). But wait, the first problem's result is the max_score, which is the N for the second problem.\n\nWait, the second problem's N is the first problem's output. So the second problem's N is the max_score from the first problem.\n\nThus, the total count is count_357(0, max_score).\n\nBut in the Python code, the second problem's N is the input to the second program, which is the first program's output. So yes.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe C program steps:\n\nRead the first problem's input.\n\nCompute the first problem's max_score.\n\nCompute the count via count_357(0, max_score).\n\nOutput that count.\n\nNow, handling the first problem's input.\n\nIn C, the first step is to read N, M, Q.\n\nThen read Q lines of a, b, c, d.\n\nBut in C, since Q is variable, we need to read Q first, then read Q entries.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N, M, Q;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &N, &M, &Q);\n\n    // Read Q entries of a, b, c, d.\n\n    int *a = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    int *b = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    int *c = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    int *d = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i =0; i < Q; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a[i], &b[i], &c[i], &d[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    // Now compute the first problem's max_score.\n\n    int max_score =0;\n\n    int *current_sequence = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\n    backtrack(current_sequence, 0, 1, &max_score);\n\n    free(current_sequence);\n\n    // Now compute the second problem's count.\n\n    int count = count_357(0, max_score);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n\n    free(a); free(b); free(c); free(d);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the backtrack function needs to have access to the a, b, c, d arrays and Q. Since in C, functions can't access variables from the outer scope unless they are passed as parameters or are global.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The backtrack function in C needs to have access to the a, b, c, d arrays and Q. So either we can make them global variables, or pass them as parameters to the backtrack function.\n\nAlternatively, making them global variables would be easier.\n\nSo, perhaps declare a, b, c, d as global arrays, but since their size is variable (Q), that's not possible. So the better approach is to pass them as parameters to the backtrack function.\n\nAlternatively, use a struct to hold the problem data and pass it along.\n\nAlternatively, since in C, functions can have parameters, but recursion complicates passing parameters. Let me think.\n\nThe backtrack function needs to have access to a, b, c, d, and Q. So perhaps we can make them global variables. But since their size is variable (Q is read at runtime), we can't have them as fixed arrays. So the only way is to use pointers and pass them as parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the backtrack function can take pointers to a, b, c, d, and Q as parameters. But since it's recursive, each call would need to pass those parameters along.\n\nHmm, this complicates the function signature.\n\nAlternatively, make a, b, c, d and Q global variables. Since in C, variables declared outside any function are global. So perhaps:\n\nint a[];\nint b[];\nint c[];\nint d[];\nint Q;\n\nBut since the size is variable, that's not possible. So perhaps using pointers and dynamically allocated arrays, and making them global.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nDeclare pointers to the arrays as global variables:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint Q;\n\nThen, in main, after reading Q, allocate the arrays and read the values into them. Then, the backtrack function can access these global variables.\n\nThis way, the backtrack function doesn't need to pass these parameters each time.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nGlobal variables:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint Q;\n\nThen in main:\n\n    a = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    b = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    c = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    d = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a[i], &b[i], &c[i], &d[i]);\n\n    }\n\nThen, the backtrack function can access a, b, c, d, and Q.\n\nThis approach would work.\n\nSo the backtrack function can be written as:\n\nvoid backtrack(int current_sequence[], int current_length, int last_val, int *max_score) {\n\n    if (current_length == N) {\n\n        int score =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n            int a_val = a[i] -1;\n\n            int b_val = b[i] -1;\n\n            if (current_sequence[b_val] - current_sequence[a_val] == c[i]) {\n\n                score += d[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (score > *max_score) {\n\n            *max_score = score;\n\n        }\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int next_val = last_val; next_val <= M; next_val++) {\n\n        current_sequence[current_length] = next_val;\n\n        backtrack(current_sequence, current_length +1, next_val, max_score);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but N is also needed here. So N must be a global variable as well.\n\nHmm, so adding N and M as global variables.\n\nSo the global variables would be:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint N, M, Q;\n\nThus, in main, after reading N, M, Q, assign them to the global variables.\n\nWait, but in C, variables declared outside any function are global. So:\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint N, M, Q;\n\nThen in main:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d %d\", &N, &M, &Q);\n\nSo the global variables N, M, Q are set.\n\nThus, the backtrack function can access them.\n\nThis way, the backtrack function can use N, M, Q, a, b, c, d without passing them as parameters.\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nNow, the count_357 function can be written as:\n\nint count_357(int current_num, int max_N) {\n\n    if (current_num > max_N) {\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    // Check if all digits are 3,5,7.\n\n    int valid = 1;\n\n    int temp = current_num;\n\n    while (temp >0) {\n\n        int digit = temp %10;\n\n        if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n\n            valid =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n        temp /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = valid ? 1 :0;\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +7, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +5, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num *10 +3, max_N);\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but when current_num is 0, the valid check will see 0 as invalid, so ans is 0, but then the recursive calls start with 7,5,3. So that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint *a, *b, *c, *d;\n\nint N, M, Q;\n\nvoid backtrack(int current_sequence[], int current_length, int last_val, int *max_score) {\n\n    if (current_length == N) {\n\n        int score =0;\n\n        for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n            int a_val = a[i]-1;\n\n            int b_val = b[i]-1;\n\n            if (current_sequence[b_val] - current_sequence[a_val] == c[i]) {\n\n                score += d[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (score > *max_score) {\n\n            *max_score = score;\n\n        }\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int next_val = last_val; next_val <= M; next_val++) {\n\n        current_sequence[current_length] = next_val;\n\n        backtrack(current_sequence, current_length +1, next_val, max_score);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint count_357(int current_num, int max_N) {\n\n    if (current_num > max_N) return 0;\n\n    int valid =1;\n\n    int temp = current_num;\n\n    while (temp >0) {\n\n        int digit = temp%10;\n\n        if (digit !=3 && digit !=5 && digit !=7) {\n\n            valid =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n        temp /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = valid ?1 :0;\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num*10 +7, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num*10 +5, max_N);\n\n    ans += count_357(current_num*10 +3, max_N);\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &N, &M, &Q);\n\n    a = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    b = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    c = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    d = malloc(Q * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a[i], &b[i], &c[i], &d[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int max_score =0;\n\n    int *current_sequence = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\n    backtrack(current_sequence, 0, 1, &max_score);\n\n    free(current_sequence);\n\n    int count = count_357(0, max_score);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", count);\n\n    free(a); free(b); free(c); free(d);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the backtrack function, the initial call is with last_val =1. Because when current_length is 0 (empty sequence), the next_val starts at 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first problem:\n\nSuppose N=2, M=2, Q=1, a=1, b=2, c=0, d=5.\n\nThe sequences possible are [1,1], [1,2], [2,2].\n\nFor each:\n\nCheck the condition: b[0] is 2, a[0] is 1. So the difference between the second and first element must be 0 (c=0).\n\nSo for [1,1], difference is 0 \u2192 add 5 \u2192 score 5.\n\n[1,2]: difference 1 \u2192 no \u2192 score 0.\n\n[2,2]: difference 0 \u2192 add 5 \u2192 score 5.\n\nSo the max is 5. So the first problem's output is 5. Then the second problem's N is 5. The second problem counts numbers made of 3,5,7 digits \u22645. The valid numbers are 3,5. So count is 2. So the final output should be 2.\n\nTesting the code with this input:\n\nInput for first problem:\n\n2 2 1\n\n1 2 0 5\n\nThe code should output 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst problem's max_score is 5.\n\nSecond problem's count_357(0,5):\n\ncurrent_num starts at 0.\n\n0 is invalid (digits 0). So ans starts at 0.\n\nThen, call 7,5,3.\n\n7 is 7>5 \u2192 returns 0.\n\n5 is 5 \u22645 \u2192 valid (digits 5). So that contributes 1.\n\n3 is 3 \u22645 \u2192 valid (3). So that contributes 1.\n\nThen, the recursive calls for 5 and 3:\n\nFor 5:\n\ncurrent_num is 5 \u2192 valid. Then, appending 7,5,3 gives 57 (57>5 \u2192 no), 55 (55>5 \u2192 no), 53 (53>5 \u2192 no). So those contribute 0. So the total for 5 is 1 (its own count) plus 0 \u2192 total 1.\n\nFor 3:\n\nsame as 5, but 3's children are 37 (too big), etc. So 3 contributes 1.\n\nSo total is 0 (from 0) + (0 from 7) + (1 from 5) + (1 from 3) \u2192 total 2. So correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case for the first problem:\n\nN=1, M=5, Q=0. Then the max_score is 0. The second problem's N is 0, so count_357(0,0) \u2192 0.\n\nAnother case where the first problem's output is 0, so the second problem's count is 0.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The backtrack function may have stack overflow for large N. For example, if N is 10, then the recursion depth is 10, which is manageable. But if N is 20, then 20 levels of recursion may be okay, but depends on the system's stack size. But given that the original Python code uses recursion, perhaps the problem expects small N.\n\n- The count_357 function may have stack overflow for large max_N. For example, if max_N is 7777777 (7 digits), then the recursion depth could be up to 7, which is okay. But for numbers with more digits, like 10 digits, it could be a problem. But again, the problem's constraints may limit this.\n\nAnother possible optimization: memoization for count_357, but since it's a programming problem, perhaps the test cases are small enough.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the final C code is as above."
