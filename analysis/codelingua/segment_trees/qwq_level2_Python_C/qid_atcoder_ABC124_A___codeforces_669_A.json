Suppose a and b are equal. Let's say a=2, b=2. First iteration: add 2, then since a >=b, a becomes 1. Next iteration, max(1,2) is 2, add again. So c is 4. Then (4*2+1)/3 =9/3=3. So the output is 3. Another test case: a=5, b=5. First iteration adds 5, then a becomes 4. Next iteration, max(4,5) is 5, so total 10. Then (10*2+1)/3 =21/3=7. So output is 7. The code should handle all these correctly.
