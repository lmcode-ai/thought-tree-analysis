Alternatively, use strchr:\n\nif (strchr(buffer, 'A') ! = NULL && strchr(buffer, 'B') ! = NULL) then yes else no. Yes, that's better. So putting it all together. Now, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2; if (scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2) ! = 4) {\n        // handle error, but maybe assume valid input\n    }\n\n    int DIF1 = x2 - x1;\n    int DIF2 = y2 - y1;\n    int x3 = x2 - DIF2;\n    int y3 = y2 + DIF1;\n    int x4 = x1 - DIF2;\n    int y4 = y1 + DIF1;\n\n    // create the intermediate string\n    char buffer[100];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"% d % d % d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\n    // check for A and B\n    int hasA = (strchr(buffer, 'A') ! = NULL);\n    int hasB = (strchr(buffer, 'B') != NULL);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", (hasA && hasB) ? \"Yes\" : \"No\");\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in the first Python code, the output is exactly the four numbers separated by spaces, so the buffer in C must exactly replicate that. The sprintf does that. Yes, this should work. Wait, but what about leading or trailing spaces? The Python code uses str(x3) + \" \" + str(y3) etc. So the format is correct. Testing edge cases: suppose the numbers are like 65 (A's ASCII code).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python scripts into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, the first Python file takes input as four integers split by spaces. It calculates some differences and then computes x3, y3, x4, y4 based on those differences. Then it prints those four values.\n\nThe second Python file reads input (which would be the output of the first), checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nSo the C program needs to read the initial input, process both steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result.\n\nHmm, the first step's output is four integers, which the second uses as its input. Wait, but the second Python script is expecting a string input. Wait, looking at the second Python code: the first line is stdin = input(), then s = stdin. So the input to the second script is the entire string output from the first, which is four numbers separated by spaces. But then the second script checks if \"A\" and \"B\" are in that string. Wait a second, that's odd. Because the first script outputs numbers, so unless the numbers include letters A or B, the second would always output \"No\". Wait, maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps the first script's output is supposed to be a string that includes letters? Wait, looking at the first Python code again: the output is the four integers converted to strings and concatenated with spaces. So unless the numbers are like 65 (ASCII for 'A') or something, but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe the problem is that the second script is supposed to process the numbers as a string, but looking for letters A and B? That might be a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to follow the given code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first script's output is a string that includes letters? Like maybe the numbers are part of a string with letters? But according to the first Python code, the output is four integers. So the second script's input would be something like \"1 2 3 4\", which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B', so the result would be \"No\". Unless the input to the first script includes letters in the numbers? Wait, no, the first script's input is split into four integers. So the first script's output is four numbers, so the second script's input is those numbers as a string, so unless the numbers are like 65 (A's ASCII) but that's not part of the problem. Hmm, maybe the problem is designed this way, and the second script is expecting the input to have letters, but the first script's output is numbers. That might be an error, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAnyway, the task is to translate the two into a single C program. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, in C, the first step is to read the input. The first Python file's input is four integers. So in C, I'll read from stdin, split into four integers. Then compute the variables as per the first script. Then, instead of printing, pass those values to the next step's processing.\n\nThe second step's processing is to check if the input string (from first's output) contains both 'A' and 'B'. Wait, but the first's output is numbers, so the input to the second step is a string of numbers separated by spaces. So in C, after computing the four numbers (x3, y3, x4, y4), I need to create a string that is their concatenation with spaces, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. But since the numbers are integers, unless they are part of a string with letters, this will always be \"No\". But the code must be translated as per the given Python.\n\nWait, but in the second Python script, the input is read as a string, so the entire line from the first's output is read as a string. So in C, after computing the four numbers, I need to create a string (like a buffer) that holds the same output as the first Python script would have printed. Then, process that string to check for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n1. Read the initial input (four integers) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute x3, y3, x4, y4 as per first script.\n\n3. Create a string (buffer) that is the concatenation of x3, \" \", y3, \" \", x4, \" \", y4. So the same as the first script's print output.\n\n4. Then, check if this buffer contains both 'A' and 'B' characters. If yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nWait, but how to do that in C?\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn the first part:\n\nRead four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nCompute DIF1 = x2 -x1, DIF2 = y2 - y1.\n\nThen x3 = x2 - DIF2, y3 = y2 + DIF1.\n\nx4 = x1 - DIF2, y4 = y1 + DIF1.\n\nThen, create a string from x3, y3, x4, y4, separated by spaces.\n\nThen, check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the numbers are integers, so their string representations won't have letters unless, for example, one of the numbers is 65 (which is 'A' in ASCII), but that's not part of the problem's input. But the code must be translated as per the given Python, so even if the result is always \"No\", that's what the code does.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nRead four integers from input.\n\nCompute the variables.\n\nBuild a string (like a buffer) with the four numbers separated by spaces.\n\nCheck if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThen output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, how to implement this in C.\n\nFirst, the input part:\n\nWe can read the input line using fgets, then parse the four integers.\n\nAlternatively, using scanf with \"%d %d %d %d\".\n\nBut need to make sure that exactly four integers are read.\n\nThen compute the variables.\n\nThen, create a buffer to hold the output string of the first step.\n\nThe maximum length needed for each number? Well, assuming the numbers can be up to, say, 1e9, which is 10 digits. So each number can be up to 11 characters (including sign?), but since the problem's input is split into integers, perhaps they are non-negative. So for four numbers, each with up to 11 digits, plus three spaces, so total length is 11*4 + 3 = 47, plus null terminator. So a buffer of 50 should be enough.\n\nSo:\n\nchar buffer[100]; // to be safe.\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%d %d %d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\nThen, check if 'A' and 'B' are present in buffer.\n\nWait, but the buffer contains numbers, so unless the numbers are like 65 (which is 'A'), but as integers, their string representations are digits. So the check would always be \"No\".\n\nBut the code must be translated as per the given Python, so proceed.\n\nTo check for presence of 'A' and 'B' in the buffer:\n\nWe can loop through each character in the buffer and check.\n\nAlternatively, use strchr:\n\nif (strchr(buffer, 'A') != NULL && strchr(buffer, 'B') != NULL) then yes else no.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n    if (scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2) != 4) {\n        // handle error, but maybe assume valid input\n    }\n\n    int DIF1 = x2 - x1;\n    int DIF2 = y2 - y1;\n    int x3 = x2 - DIF2;\n    int y3 = y2 + DIF1;\n    int x4 = x1 - DIF2;\n    int y4 = y1 + DIF1;\n\n    // create the intermediate string\n    char buffer[100];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d %d %d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\n    // check for A and B\n    int hasA = (strchr(buffer, 'A') != NULL);\n    int hasB = (strchr(buffer, 'B') != NULL);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", (hasA && hasB) ? \"Yes\" : \"No\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first Python code, the output is exactly the four numbers separated by spaces, so the buffer in C must exactly replicate that. The sprintf does that.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nWait, but what about leading or trailing spaces? The Python code uses str(x3) + \" \" + str(y3) etc. So the format is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases: suppose the numbers are like 65 (A's ASCII code). For example, if x3 is 65, then the string would have '65', which is '6' and '5', not 'A'. So the 'A' would not be present. So the code would output \"No\".\n\nBut that's correct according to the Python code's logic. Because the first script outputs numbers, so the second script's input is numbers, so unless the input to the first script had numbers that when converted to strings include 'A' and 'B', which is impossible, the result is \"No\".\n\nBut the code is correct as per the given Python.\n\nTherefore, the C code should be as above.\n\nWait, but in the first Python code, the output is printed as strings concatenated with spaces, so the buffer in C is exactly that. So the code is correct.\n\nYes, I think this should work."
