Another test case: when n=1, the valid strings are all 4 characters except those that would form 'AGC' in any of the permutations. But for length 1, the last3 is 'TTT' (but the string is length 1, so the last3 is the first three characters, but since the string is length 1, perhaps the code handles it correctly.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program. Let me start by understanding what each file does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It reads some input, processes it to compute an array m and f, then calculates the maximum c which is the minimum of a and b at each step. The output of this is c, which is printed. But since the next file (File 2) is supposed to take the output of the first as input, I need to see how the output of File 1 is used in File 2. Wait, but looking at File 2, it starts by reading n from input. Wait, the first file's output is c, but the second file's input is n. That suggests that the output of the first program is the input for the second. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is c, which is then the input for the second program. So the second program's input is that c value. Wait, but in the second Python code, the first line is n = int(input()), so the input for the second program is a number n. So the first program's output is a number which is the input to the second program. Therefore, the C program must read the initial input for the first part, compute c, then use that c as the input n for the second part, and then compute the result of the second part and print it. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says that the entire sequence should be translated into a single C program. So the first part's output is the input to the second part. Therefore, in the C program, the first part's output (c) is passed to the second part as its input (n). So the C program must first process the first part's input, compute c, then use that c as the n for the second part, and compute the second part's result, then output that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Python file (the first part), process it to get c.\n\n2. Use that c as the input n for the second part (the second Python file's code), process it, and output the result of the second part.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first read the input for the first part, compute c, then pass that c to the second part's code, compute the second part's result, and print that.\n\nNow, I need to translate both parts into C, ensuring that the first part's output is used as the second part's input, and that there's no I/O in between except the initial read and final print.\n\nStarting with the first part (File 1):\n\nThe first part reads N=368, initializes m and f arrays of size N. Then reads some number of lines (given by the first input line). Each line has x, a, b. Then processes those into the arrays m and f. Then computes the maximum c as the minimum of a and b at each step.\n\nWait, let me parse the first Python code again:\n\nThe first code:\n\n- Reads N as 368 (fixed?), but actually, looking at the code, N is set to 368, but in the code, the loop is for i in range(int(input())): so the first input is the number of test cases? Wait, no, the first line of input is read as the number of lines to process. Let me see:\n\nWait, the first line of input is read via input(), converted to an integer, and that's the loop count. So for each of those lines, the line is split into x, a, b. Then a and b are converted to integers, with b being adjusted by +1. Then, depending on x being 'M' or not, the m or f array is updated with +2 and -2 at positions a and b.\n\nThen, after processing all lines, the code loops through the N elements (from 0 to 367?), accumulating a and b (summing m and f arrays up to that point), and tracking the maximum c which is the minimum of a and b at each step.\n\nWait, the variables a, b, c are initialized to 0. Then for each i in 0 to N-1:\n\na += m[i], so a is the cumulative sum of m up to i.\n\nSimilarly for b and f. Then, the minimum of a and b is compared to c, and if it's larger, c is updated. So c is the maximum of all min(a, b) over all positions.\n\nThe output is c.\n\nSo the first part's output is c, which is an integer. The second part's input is n, which is that c.\n\nNow, the second part (File 2) is a dynamic programming problem to count the number of valid strings of length n (the input) that don't have certain forbidden substrings, modulo 1e9+7. The code uses a recursive DFS with memoization, checking for forbidden patterns.\n\nThe problem here is to translate both parts into C, with the first part's output being the input to the second part.\n\nNow, the challenge is to write a C program that does all of this.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first part in C.\n\nFirst part steps in C:\n\n- Read the first integer (number of test cases) from stdin.\n\n- Then read that many lines, each line has x (a character?), a, b. Wait, in the Python code, the line is split into x, a, b. The line is split by whitespace. So for each line, the first token is x (a single character?), then a and b as integers.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the line is split into three parts. For example, if the line is \"M 5 10\", then x is 'M', a is 5, b is 10. Then, the code does b = int(b) +1. Wait, the original code has:\n\nx, a, b = input()[:-1].split()\n\nWait, input()[:-1] is to remove the trailing newline. So splitting the line into three parts. So x is the first token (could be a single character?), a and b are the next two numbers. So in C, for each line, we need to read a string, split into three parts. Alternatively, perhaps using sscanf.\n\nAlternatively, for each line, read the entire line, then parse it.\n\nIn C, perhaps using fgets to read each line, then using sscanf to parse the components.\n\nBut let's think of the steps:\n\nInitialize arrays m and f of size 368 (since N is 368). Then for each line:\n\nRead the line, split into x, a, b.\n\nThen, a is converted to integer, b is converted to integer, then add 1 to b.\n\nThen, if x is 'M', add 2 to m[a], subtract 2 from m[b]. Else (assuming x is 'F'?), add 2 to f[a], subtract 2 from f[b].\n\nWait, in the Python code, the else case is when x is not 'M', but the code doesn't check for other possibilities. So in the C code, we can assume that x is either 'M' or 'F' (or whatever else, but the code treats anything else as the else case).\n\nOnce all lines are processed, compute the cumulative sums a and b, track the maximum c as the minimum of a and b at each step.\n\nSo in C, the first part's code would be:\n\nRead the first integer (number of test cases) via scanf or similar.\n\nThen loop that many times, each time reading a line, parsing x, a, b.\n\nThen process m and f arrays.\n\nThen compute the cumulative sums and find c.\n\nNow, the second part is the DP problem. Let's see the second Python code.\n\nThe second code is a recursive DP with memoization. The problem is to count the number of valid strings of length n (the input from first part) that don't have certain forbidden substrings. The forbidden substrings are checked in the ok function.\n\nThe ok function checks if adding a new character to the last 3 characters (making a 4-length string) would create 'AGC' in any of the possible permutations of the last 4 characters (specifically, swapping adjacent characters in the last 4 and checking if any of those permutations contain 'AGC').\n\nWait, the ok function's code:\n\ndef ok(last4):\n    for i in range(4):\n        t = list(last4)\n        if i >= 1:\n            t[i], t[i - 1] = t[i - 1], t[i]\n        if ''.join(t).count('AGC') >= 1:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to 3. For each i, it creates a copy of last4, then if i >=1, swaps t[i] and t[i-1]. Then checks if the resulting string has 'AGC' as a substring. If any of these permutations (for any i) has 'AGC', then the function returns False (meaning this new character is invalid). Otherwise returns True.\n\nWait, the function is checking whether adding the new character (the last character of last4 + c?) Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the function is called with last4 being a 4-character string? Wait, no, in the code, the function is called in the second part's code as:\n\nIn the dfs function, when considering adding a new character c, the new last3 is last3[1:] + c. Wait, the parameters for the dfs function are cur and last3, which is a 3-character string. So when adding a new character, the new last3 is the last two characters of the previous last3 plus the new character. So the ok function is called with last3 + c? Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nIn the dfs loop, for each candidate character c in \"ACGT\", the code checks if ok(last3 + c). So the argument to ok is the last3 (3 characters) plus the new c, making a 4-character string. The function ok is checking all possible swaps of adjacent characters in this 4-character string (for each position i from 0 to 3, swapping i and i-1 if i >=1?), but the code's loop is for i in 0..3, and for each i, it creates a copy of the 4-character string, swaps the i-th and (i-1)th characters (if i >=1), then checks if the resulting string contains 'AGC'.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(4):\n\n    t = list(last4)  # last4 is the 4-character string passed to ok.\n\n    if i >=1:\n\n        swap t[i] and t[i-1]\n\n    then check if the joined string has 'AGC'\n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to 3. For each i, the code creates a new list t (copy of last4), then if i is >=1, swaps t[i] and t[i-1]. Then, check if the string formed by t has 'AGC' as a substring. If any of these permutations (for any i) has 'AGC', then the function returns False (invalid). Otherwise, returns True.\n\nWait, but the first iteration (i=0) doesn't swap anything. So the original string is checked. Then for i=1, swap positions 1 and 0. For i=2, swap 2 and 1. For i=3, swap 3 and 2. So the code is checking all possible adjacent swaps in the 4-character string, and if any of those permutations (including the original) contains 'AGC', then it's invalid.\n\nThe purpose is to prevent the new string from having 'AGC' in any of these adjacent swaps. So the forbidden condition is that the new character added doesn't create a situation where any adjacent swap would form 'AGC'.\n\nThe DP approach uses memoization to store the number of valid strings up to a certain length with a certain last 3 characters.\n\nThe base case is when cur == n, return 1.\n\nThe mod is 1e9+7.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, 'TTT').\n\nNow, translating this into C requires implementing the DP with memoization. Since recursion in C can be tricky for large n (but given that the first part's output is c, which is the maximum of min(a,b) over 368 steps, but what's the possible value of c? Well, the maximum possible a and b would be up to 2*N (since each interval adds 2 and subtracts 2). So for N=368, the maximum a and b could be up to 2*368, so c could be up to 2*368. So n in the second part is up to 736. So the maximum n is manageable with a recursive approach, but recursion depth could be up to n, which for 700 is okay, but in C, stack might be an issue. Alternatively, we can implement it iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, since the recursion depth is up to n (which is up to 700?), it's manageable with recursion. But in C, the stack might be okay. Alternatively, better to implement it iteratively with memoization tables.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the DP approach.\n\nThe state is (current length, last3). The last3 is a 3-character string. Since each character can be A, C, G, T, there are 4^3 = 64 possible last3 states. The current length can be up to n (the input from first part). So the total number of states is n * 64, which for n up to 700 is 44800, which is manageable with memoization via an array.\n\nSo in C, we can precompute a 2D array for memoization. Let's see:\n\nThe memo can be represented as a 2D array: memo[cur][last3], where last3 is an integer representing the 3-character string. Since each character is one of 4 options (A, C, G, T), we can encode the last3 as a base-4 number. For example, each character can be mapped to 0-3 (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). Then the 3-character string can be represented as a number between 0 and 63 (since 4^3=64). So the memo can be an array of size (n+1) x 64.\n\nSo the steps for the second part in C:\n\n- Read n (from the first part's output c).\n\n- Initialize memo as a 2D array of size (n+1) x 64, initialized to -1 (or some invalid value to indicate not computed).\n\n- The function dfs can be implemented iteratively with memoization, or via a recursive function with memoization.\n\nBut in C, recursion might be manageable here. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, the first part's code in C:\n\nWe need to read the first input (number of test cases), then read each line, parse x, a, b, then update the m and f arrays.\n\nThen compute the cumulative sums and find c.\n\nOnce c is found, that becomes the n for the second part.\n\nThen, the second part's code is to compute the number of valid strings of length n, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, let's start coding.\n\nFirst, the first part in C:\n\nWe need to read the first integer (number of test cases). Let's say:\n\nint T;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &T);\n\nThen, for each test case, read a line. Each line has x (a character?), a and b as integers.\n\nWait, in Python, the line is split into three parts. So in C, perhaps using sscanf on each line.\n\nBut to read each line, perhaps using fgets to read the entire line, then parse it.\n\nAlternatively, using scanf in a loop. But since the line may have spaces, perhaps using scanf with %c for x, but that might not work because after the first number, the rest is lines.\n\nAlternatively, for each line after the first, read the entire line, then parse it.\n\nSo code outline for first part:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define N 368\n\nint main() {\n    int T;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n    // Read and process T lines\n    int m[N] = {0};\n    int f[N] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {\n        char line[100];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n        // parse line into x, a, b\n        char x;\n        int a, b;\n        sscanf(line, \" %c %d %d\", &x, &a, &b); // note the space to skip leading whitespace\n        // or maybe better to use sscanf with the line\n        // but need to check for possible trailing characters\n        // assuming the line is properly formatted\n        b += 1; // as in Python code\n        if (x == 'M') {\n            m[a] += 2;\n            m[b] -= 2;\n        } else {\n            f[a] += 2;\n            f[b] -= 2;\n        }\n    }\n    // compute a, b, c\n    int a_total = 0, b_total = 0, c = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        a_total += m[i];\n        b_total += f[i];\n        int current_min = (a_total < b_total) ? a_total : b_total;\n        if (current_min > c) {\n            c = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n    // Now, c is the output of first part, which is the input to second part\n    // Now, proceed to compute the second part with n = c\n    // ... code for second part here ...\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the first line is read via input(), which is the number of test cases. Then, for each of those lines, the line is read (with input()), but in the code above, after reading T, the next T lines are read via fgets. That's correct.\n\nNow, the second part's code.\n\nThe second part's code in C:\n\nWe need to compute the number of valid strings of length n (c from first part) using the DP approach.\n\nFirst, the mod is 1e9+7.\n\nThe DP can be implemented with memoization. Let's represent the last3 as a 3-character string, but in C, it's easier to represent it as an integer (as discussed earlier).\n\nFirst, let's map each character to a number:\n\nchar_to_num['A'] = 0, 'C' =1, 'G'=2, 'T'=3.\n\nSo for a string like \"TTT\", the code would be 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 3*(4^2 +4 +1) = 3*21 = 63? Wait, let's see:\n\nEach character is 0-3. The first character (leftmost) is the most significant digit. So for a 3-character string, the value is (c0)*4^2 + (c1)*4 + c2.\n\nSo for \"TTT\", each character is 3, so 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63.\n\nSo the encoding is straightforward.\n\nThe memo can be a 2D array: memo[cur][code], where cur ranges from 0 to n, and code from 0 to 63.\n\nWe can initialize the memo as a 2D array of size (n+1) x 64, initialized to -1 (or some invalid value).\n\nThe base case is when cur == n, return 1.\n\nThe recursive function would be something like:\n\nlong long dfs(int cur, int last3_code) {\n\n    if (cur == n) return 1;\n\n    if (memo[cur][last3_code] != -1) return memo[cur][last3_code];\n\n    long long ret = 0;\n\n    for each possible next_char in 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' {\n\n        char new_char = next_char;\n\n        // create the new_last4 string: last3 (3 chars) + new_char, then check if it's okay.\n\n        // To form the last4, the last3 is represented by last3_code. To get the characters:\n\n        int c0 = (last3_code / 16) %4;\n\n        int c1 = (last3_code /4) %4;\n\n        int c2 = last3_code %4;\n\n        char chars[4] = {c0, c1, c2, new_char_code};\n\n        // Wait, but the new_char is the new character, so the last4 is the previous last3 (3 chars) plus the new_char, making a 4-character string.\n\n        // So the last4 is [c0, c1, c2, new_char_code].\n\n        // Now, check if this last4 is okay.\n\n        // To check, we need to see if any of the permutations (swapping adjacent pairs) contains 'AGC'.\n\n        // The ok function in Python checks all possible swaps of adjacent characters in the 4-character string.\n\n        // So in code, for the 4-character string, we need to check all possible swaps as per the ok function.\n\n        // Let's see:\n\n        // The function ok checks for each i from 0 to 3:\n\n        // create a copy of the 4 characters, then swap i and i-1 if i >=1, then check if the string has 'AGC'.\n\n        // So for each i in 0..3:\n\n        // make a copy of the 4 characters.\n\n        // if i >=1, swap positions i and i-1.\n\n        // then check if the resulting string contains 'AGC'.\n\n        // If any of these permutations has 'AGC', then the new_char is invalid.\n\n        // So, to compute whether the new_char is allowed, we need to check all these permutations.\n\n        // Let's code this.\n\n        // First, create the 4-character array (as integers 0-3):\n\n        int last4[4] = {c0, c1, c2, new_char_code};\n\n        // Now, check for each i from 0 to 3:\n\n        // create a copy of last4, then swap if needed, then check for 'AGC'.\n\n        // To check for 'AGC', the string must have the sequence A (0), G (2), C (1) in consecutive positions.\n\n        // So in the 4-character array, check if any of the permutations has 0,2,1 in consecutive positions.\n\n        // Wait, perhaps it's easier to represent the characters as their original letters (A, C, G, T) and then check for the substring 'AGC'.\n\n        // Alternatively, since the code is in terms of numbers, perhaps we can check for the sequence 0 (A), 2 (G), 1 (C).\n\n        // So for each permutation, check if any three consecutive characters form 0,2,1.\n\n        // Let me think of the steps:\n\n        // For each i in 0..3:\n\n        // create a temporary array t of the 4 elements.\n\n        // if i >=1, swap t[i] and t[i-1].\n\n        // then check if in the resulting array, there exists a triplet (positions 0-2, 1-3) that is 0,2,1.\n\n        // Wait, the 'AGC' is three characters, so in a 4-character string, there are three possible triplets:\n\n        // positions 0-2, 1-3.\n\n        // So for each permutation (after swapping), check if any of the triplets is A-G-C (0,2,1).\n\n        // So for each permutation:\n\n        // check if any of the first three elements (indices 0,1,2) form 0,2,1,\n\n        // or the next three (indices 1,2,3) form 0,2,1.\n\n        // So for each permutation:\n\n        // check for the presence of 0 followed by 2 followed by 1 in any consecutive triplet.\n\n        // Let's code this.\n\n        // Let's first create a helper function to check if a given 4-character array (as integers) is okay.\n\n        // Let me write a helper function is_ok(int last4[4]):\n\n        // returns 1 if the new character is allowed, 0 otherwise.\n\n        // So inside the loop over next_char:\n\n        // create the last4 array as above.\n\n        // then check if is_ok(last4) is true.\n\n        // If yes, then proceed.\n\n        // So first, implement the is_ok function.\n\n        // Let's code this as a helper function.\n\n        // Wait, but in C, functions can't be nested inside other functions, so need to handle that.\n\n        // Alternatively, code the check inline.\n\n        // Let me proceed step by step.\n\n        // For the current last4 array (the 4 characters):\n\n        // For each i from 0 to 3:\n\n        // create a copy of the last4 array.\n\n        // if i >=1, swap elements at positions i-1 and i.\n\n        // then check if in this modified array, any of the triplets (0-2, 1-3) is 0,2,1.\n\n        // If any of the permutations (for any i) has such a triplet, then the new_char is invalid.\n\n        // So the new_char is allowed only if none of the permutations (for any i) has such a triplet.\n\n        // So the is_ok function would return true only if for all permutations (all i), none of them has the forbidden triplet.\n\n        // So the code for checking:\n\n        // Let's first create a helper function:\n\n        int is_ok(int last4[4]) {\n\n            for (int i = 0;

So the dfs function must be declared outside main.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the dfs function inside main, but in C that's not allowed. So the code structure would be:\n\n- Declare the is_ok function.\n\n- Declare the dfs function.\n\n- In main, after computing n, allocate memo, initialize it, then call dfs(0, 63, n, memo).\n\nBut the dfs function needs to have access to the memo and n. Wait, but in the parameters, we can pass them.\n\nWait, the dfs function's parameters are (cur, last3_code, n, memo). So that's okay.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut let's check for possible errors.\n\nFirst, in the first part's code, when reading each line, the sscanf may not work correctly if the line has leading spaces. The format string in sscanf is \" %c %d %d\" \u2014 the leading space skips any whitespace, then reads a character, then two integers. That should work.\n\nWait, the line is read via fgets into line, which includes the newline. The sscanf with \" %c %d %d\" will read the first non-whitespace character as x, then the next two numbers. But if the line is like \"M 5 10\\n\", then it should work. But if the line has more than three tokens, it might have issues. But assuming the input is correct as per the problem's constraints.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, the variables a and b are read, then b is increased by 1. So in the code, after reading a and b, we do b +=1.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nThe initial code for the second part in Python uses memo as a list of dictionaries. In C, we replaced it with a 2D array, which is more efficient.\n\nThe is_ok function is correctly implemented?\n\nLet me test with an example.\n\nSuppose last4 is 'AGC' followed by another character. For example, last4 is 'A','G','C','X' (where X is any character). Then, when i=0, the array is as is. The first triplet (0,1,2) is A G C \u2192 which is exactly 'AGC', so the function returns 0 (invalid). So the new_char would be invalid.\n\nAnother example: last4 is 'A','C','G','T'. Then, when i=2, swapping positions 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2?), wait let's see:\n\nWait, for i=2, the code swaps positions 1 and 2 (since i-1 is 1). So the array becomes A, G, C, T. Then the first triplet is A G C \u2192 which is forbidden. So the function returns 0.\n\nAnother case: the last4 is 'T','A','G','C'. Then, when i=3, swapping positions 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3). The array becomes T, A, C, G. The triplet 1-3 is A, C, G \u2192 not forbidden. But the first triplet is T, A, C \u2192 no. The second triplet is A, C, G \u2192 no. So the swapped array doesn't have 'AGC'. But the original array (before swapping) has the last4 as T A G C \u2192 the triplet 1-3 is A G C \u2192 which is forbidden. So the original array (i=0) would have the first triplet T A G \u2192 no, second triplet A G C \u2192 yes. So the function returns 0.\n\nThus, the is_ok function correctly returns 0 in this case.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single C program.\n\nBut there are some points to note:\n\n- The first part's code must read the input correctly.\n\n- The second part's code must use the n from the first part.\n\n- The memo array must be dynamically allocated.\n\nNow, let's write the full code.\n\nAlso, note that in the first part, the variables a_total and b_total are initialized to 0, and then for each index from 0 to N-1 (since N is 368), we add m[i] and f[i] to a_total and b_total respectively, then track the minimum.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the loop is for i in range(N), which is 0 to 367 (since N=368). So in C, the loop is for (int i=0; i<N; i++).\n\nNow, the full code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define N 368\n#define MOD 1000000007\n\nint is_ok(int last4[4]) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        int t[4];\n        memcpy(t, last4, 4 * sizeof(int));\n        if (i >= 1) {\n            int temp = t[i - 1];\n            t[i - 1] = t[i];\n            t[i] = temp;\n        }\n        // Check for 'AGC' (0,2,1) in consecutive positions\n        if (t[0] == 0 && t[1] == 2 && t[2] == 1) return 0;\n        if (t[1] == 0 && t[2] == 2 && t[3] == 1) return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nlong long dfs(int cur, int last3_code, int n, long long (*memo)[64]) {\n    if (cur == n) return 1;\n    if (memo[cur][last3_code] != -1) return memo[cur][last3_code];\n    long long ret = 0;\n    // Iterate over possible next characters: A(0), C(1), G(2), T(3)\n    for (int next_char = 0; next_char < 4; next_char++) {\n        // Extract previous characters from last3_code\n        int c0 = (last3_code / 16) % 4;\n        int c1 = (last3_code / 4) % 4;\n        int c2 = last3_code % 4;\n        int last4[4] = {c0, c1, c2, next_char};\n        if (is_ok(last4)) {\n            // Compute new_last3_code\n            int new_last3 = (c1 * 16) + (c2 * 4) + next_char;\n            ret += dfs(cur + 1, new_last3, n, memo);\n            if (ret >= MOD) ret -= MOD; // To prevent overflow before modulo\n        }\n    }\n    memo[cur][last3_code] = ret % MOD;\n    return ret % MOD;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int T;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n    int m[N] = {0};\n    int f[N] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {\n        char line[100];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n        char x;\n        int a, b;\n        sscanf(line, \" %c %d %d\", &x, &a, &b);\n        b += 1;\n        if (x == 'M') {\n            m[a] += 2;\n            m[b] -= 2;\n        } else {\n            f[a] += 2;\n            f[b] -= 2;\n        }\n    }\n    // Compute c\n    int a_total = 0, b_total = 0, c = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        a_total += m[i];\n        b_total += f[i];\n        int current_min = (a_total < b_total) ? a_total : b_total;\n        if (current_min > c) {\n            c = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n    // Now process second part with n = c\n    int n = c;\n    if (n == 0) {\n        printf(\"1\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    // Allocate memo\n    long long (*memo)[64] = malloc( (n + 1) * sizeof(long long[64]));\n    if (!memo) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Memory allocation failed\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    // Initialize memo to -1\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 64; j++) {\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n        }\n    }\n    // Initial last3 is 'TTT' \u2192 code 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63\n    long long result = dfs(0, 63, n, memo);\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result % MOD);\n    free(memo);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'T' is represented as 3, so 'TTT' is indeed 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63.\n\nAlso, in the dfs function, when adding to ret, we have to mod it to prevent overflow. But since the numbers can be up to 1e9+7, adding multiple times could exceed the maximum of long long. So perhaps better to mod after each addition.\n\nAlternatively, since MOD is 1e9+7, and the maximum possible value for each step is MOD, adding up to 4 possibilities each time, the intermediate values can be kept modulo MOD.\n\nIn the code above, after each addition, we subtract MOD if ret exceeds it. But perhaps better to do:\n\nret = (ret + dfs(...)) % MOD;\n\nBut in C, the modulo operator can handle negative numbers, but to ensure it's correct, perhaps better to compute modulo after each step.\n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nret += dfs(...);\nret %= MOD;\n\nBut since the return value of dfs is already modded, adding them and then mod again is okay.\n\nWait, the dfs function returns ret % MOD, so each term is already modded. So adding them and then mod again is okay.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nret = (ret + dfs(...)) % MOD;\n\nBut in any case, the code should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nIf n is 0, the code returns 1. Which matches the Python code's behavior (since when n=0, the initial call is dfs(0, 'TTT'), and since cur ==0 ==n, returns 1).\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, the valid strings are all 4 characters except those that would form 'AGC' in any of the permutations. But for length 1, the last3 is 'TTT' (but the string is length 1, so the last3 is the first three characters, but since the string is length 1, perhaps the code handles it correctly.\n\nOverall, this should be the correct translation."
