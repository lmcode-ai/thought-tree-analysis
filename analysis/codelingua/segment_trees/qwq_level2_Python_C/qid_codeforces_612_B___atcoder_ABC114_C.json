So the condition is redundant except for the first part (checking if the number exceeds N). Wait, no, the code's condition is that the set of digits must be exactly {'3','5','7'}, which requires that all three digits are present. So even if the digits are only 3 and 5, it won't count. So the code's condition is that the number must contain all three digits. So the function counts numbers that have at least one 3, one 5, and one 7. So the code is counting numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits and containing all three digits, and not exceeding N.\n\nHmm, that's a bit more complex. So the function's ans is 1 only if the current number's digits include all three. So for example, 357 is counted, 335 is not (no 7), 573 is counted, etc. So the code's logic is correct in that sense. So the function counts numbers made of 3,5,7 digits and containing all three digits, and not exceeding N.\n\nSo in C, how to implement this? The function aaa in C would need to track the current number and the set of digits present. Since the digits are only 3,5,7, we can track whether each has been used.",

So the initial call's contribution is 0, but the recursive calls proceed. So the C function's base case is correct. Wait, but in the Python code, the ans is 1 only if the set of the digits of the current number (excluding leading zeros?) is exactly {'3','5','7'}. But in the C approach, the mask tracks whether each digit has been used. So the mask being 7 means all three are present, so the number has at least one of each. So that's correct. So the C function can be written as:\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = 0; if (mask == 7) { // all three digits present\n        count = 1;\n    }\n    for (int digit : {3,5,7}) { // need to loop over 3,5,7\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit ==3) new_mask |= 1<<0;\n        else if (digit ==5) new_mask |= 1<<1;\n        else if (digit ==7) new_mask |= 1<<2;\n        int new_num = current *10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, you can't have a loop like for (int digit : {3,5,7}), so I need to write a loop with each digit. So:\n\nfor (int i =0; i<3; i++) {\n    int digit;\n    if (i ==0) digit=3;\n    else if (i==1) digit=5;\n    else digit=7;\n    // process digit\n}\n\nAlternatively, use an array:\n\nint digits [] = {3,5,7};\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n    int digit = digits[i];\n    ...\n} Yes, that's better. So the function would be:\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = 0; if (mask == 7) {\n        count = 1;\n    }\n    int digits[] = {3,5,7};\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        int digit = digits[i];\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit ==3) new_mask |= 1<<0;\n        else if (digit ==5) new_mask |= 1<<1;\n        else new_mask |= 1<<2;\n        int new_num = current *10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but when current is 0, and we add digit 3, the new_num is 3, mask becomes 1 (bit0 set). Then, when we add another digit, say 5, the new_num is 35, mask becomes 1 | (1<<1) = 3. Then adding 7 would set mask to 7, so that number would count. So this should work.",

But wait, in the Python code, the initial call is aaa('0'), which is passed as a string. The first check is if int(n) > N. So when the initial call is '0', the current is 0, which is okay. The mask starts at 0, so the count is 0 (since mask is 0 !=7). Then, the function proceeds to add 3,5,7 digits. So the initial call in C would be aaa(0,0, N). The result of that is the answer to print. Putting it all together:\n\nThe C program will first read n and a array, compute res as per first part, then set N = res, then compute the result of aaa(0,0,N), then print that.",

Wait, in the code for aaa:\n\nWhen digit is 3, new_mask is mask | (1<<0). Similarly for 5 and 7. Yes. Now, let me check the initial example. Suppose the first part's res is 0. Then N is 0.

Then, for each digit 3,5,7:\n\nnew_num is 0*10 +3 =3, which is >0, so the recursive call returns 0.\n\nSame for 5 and7. So the total count is 0. So the output is 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python files into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Python file. It reads an integer n, then a list of a's. Then it creates a list b where each element b[a[i]-1] is set to i. Then it calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in b. Finally, it prints that sum. Wait, but the second Python file is a separate program. Wait, the user said the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. Oh right! So the first Python program's output is the input to the second. But the second program here is taking input N via input(). Wait, but the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. So the second program's N is the first program's output. So the C program must first run the first part, then the second part, using the first's result as the input for the second part. But how to combine them into a single C program?\n\nHmm, the user wants a single C program that does the entire sequence. So the first part's output is the input to the second part. But in C, since it's a single program, I can just pass the result directly between the two parts without I/O. So the first part's result (res) is the N for the second part. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first part (n and a array).\n2. Compute res (the sum) as in the first Python file.\n3. Use that res as N for the second part's function.\n4. Compute the result of the second part (aaa('0') in Python) and print it.\n\nSo the C program will have to do all that in sequence, without any intermediate I/O except the first input and the final output.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part in C:\n\nThe first part's variables:\n\n- n is an integer read from input.\n- a is a list of integers read as a split line.\n- b is an array of size n, initialized to 0.\n- Then, for each i in 0..n-1, set b[a[i]-1] = i. Wait, in Python, a is a list of integers, so a[i] is the element. So in C, the a array is of integers. The loop for i from 0 to n-1 (since range(n) is 0-based). So in C, for (i=0; i < n; i++) { b[a[i]-1] = i; }\n\nThen, compute res as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in b. Wait, the loop in Python is for i in range(1, n), so from 1 to n-1 inclusive. So in C, for (i=1; i < n; i++) { res += abs(b[i] - b[i-1]); }\n\nSo the first part's code in C would be:\n\nRead n from stdin, then read the a array. Then compute b and res.\n\nSecond part in C:\n\nThe second part's code is a recursive function aaa(n) that counts numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits, not exceeding N (which is the first part's res). The function is called with '0' initially, but in C, since it's a number, perhaps we can handle it as integers. Wait, the Python code uses strings to check the digits. Let me see:\n\nThe Python function aaa(n) takes a string n (since it starts with '0'), and checks if converting to integer is greater than N. Then, if the digits are only 3,5,7, it counts 1, plus the recursive calls for appending 3,5,7.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are a bit tricky. The initial call is aaa('0'), which starts with 0, then appends digits. The function checks if the current number (as integer) exceeds N. If so, returns 0. Otherwise, if all characters in the string are in {'3','5','7'}, then it adds 1, else not? Wait, the code says:\n\nans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'} else 0\n\nWait, wait, the code in the second Python file:\n\ndef aaa(n):\n    if int(n) > N:\n        return 0\n    ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n    for i in '753':\n        ans += aaa(n + i)\n    return ans\n\nWait, the first condition is if the current number (int(n)) is greater than N, return 0. Then, the ans is 1 if all the digits are 3,5,7. Wait, the set of the digits must be a subset of {'3','5','7'}, but the code checks if the set is exactly {'7','5','3'}, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the code says set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'}, which would require that all digits are exactly those three, but that's not possible unless the number has all three digits. Wait, no, the set is the unique digits. For example, if the number is 333, the set would be {'3'}, which is not equal to {'3','5','7'}, so ans would be 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the code's condition is checking whether all the digits are 3,5, or 7. Because the set of the digits must be a subset of those three. But the code is checking if the set is exactly the set containing all three? That would mean that the number must have all three digits present. That's probably a mistake. Wait, looking at the Python code again:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7', '5', '3'} else 0\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for example, if the number is 3, then the set is {'3'}, which is not equal to the set {'3','5','7'}, so ans would be 0. But according to the problem, the numbers should consist only of 3,5,7 digits. So the correct condition should be that all characters in the string are in {'3','5','7'}, which can be checked by ensuring that the set of characters is a subset of {'3','5','7'}, but the code is checking for equality with the full set. That's a bug in the original code. But since we have to translate it as is, we have to replicate that condition, even if it's incorrect. Because the user wants the same behavior.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the code again. The function is supposed to count numbers composed only of 3,5,7 digits, and not exceeding N. The code's condition for ans is 1 only if the digits are exactly 3,5,7. Wait, no, the set of the digits must be exactly the set {'3','5','7'}, which would require that all three digits are present. That's not correct. For example, 35 is allowed, but according to the code, the set would be {'3','5'}, which is not equal to the required set, so ans would be 0. So the code is wrong. But since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is. So the code's logic is that the number must contain all three digits? That's probably a mistake, but I have to follow it.\n\nHmm, but maybe the code is correct. Let me think again. The code says:\n\nans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'} else 0\n\nWait, the set of the digits must be exactly the three elements. So the number must have all three digits present. So for example, 357 would be counted, but 333 would not. That's a very restrictive condition. But perhaps that's what the problem requires. Since the user provided this code, I have to replicate that logic.\n\nSo the function counts numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits, but only those that contain all three digits? That's odd, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo the function aaa(n) is recursive. The base case is if the current number (as integer) exceeds N, return 0. Otherwise, check if the digits are exactly 3,5,7 (all three present?), then add 1 if so, then recursively add the results of appending 7,5,3 to the current number.\n\nWait, the loop is for i in '753', so the order is 7,5,3? The order might not matter since it's adding all possibilities.\n\nNow, translating this into C. The problem is handling the recursion and the digits.\n\nFirst, the second part's N is the first part's res. So in C, after computing res, we can set N = res, then compute the result of the second part.\n\nThe function aaa in C would need to take a number (as a string?), but in C, handling strings recursively might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the current number as an integer, and track its digits.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the digits must be only 3,5,7. So when building the number, each step appends a digit (3,5,7). So the function can be written with the current number as an integer, and the digits so far. Wait, but how to track the digits? Alternatively, since the digits must be exactly 3,5,7, perhaps we can track the digits in a string, but in C, strings are a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since the digits are only 3,5,7, each step appends one of those digits, so the current number is built by multiplying by 10 and adding the digit. So the function can be written with the current number as an integer, and the digits so far can be tracked via the path taken. Wait, but the condition requires that all digits are 3,5,7. Since we are only appending those digits, the current number's digits are always 3,5,7. So the condition is redundant except for the first part (checking if the number exceeds N). Wait, no, the code's condition is that the set of digits must be exactly {'3','5','7'}, which requires that all three digits are present. So even if the digits are only 3 and 5, it won't count. So the code's condition is that the number must contain all three digits. So the function counts numbers that have at least one 3, one 5, and one 7. So the code is counting numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits and containing all three digits, and not exceeding N.\n\nHmm, that's a bit more complex. So the function's ans is 1 only if the current number's digits include all three. So for example, 357 is counted, 335 is not (no 7), 573 is counted, etc.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct in that sense. So the function counts numbers made of 3,5,7 digits and containing all three digits, and not exceeding N.\n\nSo in C, how to implement this?\n\nThe function aaa in C would need to track the current number and the set of digits present. Since the digits are only 3,5,7, we can track whether each has been used.\n\nAlternatively, for each recursive call, we can track the current number and a bitmask indicating which digits have been used. For example, a bitmask with bits 0,1,2 for 3,5,7. So when a digit is added, we set the corresponding bit. Then, when the number is valid (all three bits set), we count it.\n\nThis way, we can avoid converting the number to a string each time, which is more efficient.\n\nSo here's the plan for the C function:\n\nWe can write a recursive function that takes the current number, and a mask indicating which digits (3,5,7) have been used so far. The mask can be an integer where bits 0,1,2 correspond to 3,5,7. For example, if the current number has a 3 and 5, the mask would be 0b110 (binary 6?), but let's see:\n\nWait, let's assign:\n\nbit 0: 3 is present?\n\nbit 1:5 is present?\n\nbit 2:7 is present?\n\nSo mask starts at 0. When a digit is added, we set the corresponding bit. So for example, adding 3 sets bit 0, adding 5 sets bit1, etc.\n\nThen, when the mask has all three bits set (mask == 0b111 =7), then the number is counted.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n\n    int count = 0;\n\n    if (mask == 7) { // all three digits present\n        count = 1;\n    }\n\n    for (int digit : {3,5,7}) { // need to loop over 3,5,7\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit ==3) new_mask |= 1<<0;\n        else if (digit ==5) new_mask |= 1<<1;\n        else if (digit ==7) new_mask |= 1<<2;\n        int new_num = current *10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but the initial call is with current=0, mask=0? Wait, the original Python starts with '0', which is 0. But in the code, when you call aaa('0'), the first check is if 0 > N? Well, if N is the first part's result, which is at least 0. So if N is 0, then the function returns 0? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait in the Python code, the initial call is aaa('0'). The first check is if int(n) > N. So for '0', the int is 0. So if N is 0, then it's not greater, so proceed. Then, the ans is 1 if the digits of 0 are exactly {'3','5','7'}, but 0's digits are just '0', so the set is {'0'}, which is not equal to the required set. So ans is 0. Then, the loop adds '7', '5', '3' to '0', making '07', '05', '03', but those are treated as 7,5,3 when converted to integers. Wait, but in Python, when you do n + i where n is '0' and i is '7', it becomes '07', which as an integer is 7. So the leading zero is ignored. So in the C code, when building the numbers, the initial 0 is treated as 0, but when appending digits, leading zeros are allowed but when converted to integer, they become the actual number. So in the C code, the initial call would be with current=0, mask=0. Then, when adding 3, the new_num is 0*10 +3 =3, mask becomes 1 (bit0 set). Then, when adding 5, new_num is 5, mask becomes 2 (bit1). Etc.\n\nWait, but the mask starts at 0. So for the initial 0, the mask is 0, so the count is 0 (since mask !=7). Then, the function proceeds to add 3,5,7 digits. So the first step is to call the function with current=0, mask=0, and then for each digit, compute new_num and new_mask, then recurse.\n\nWait, but the initial call in Python is with '0', which is 0. So the C function's initial call would be aaa(0, 0, N). The base case is if current exceeds N, return 0. Otherwise, check if mask is 7 (all three digits present). Then add the recursive calls for each digit.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the initial '0' is considered as a number, but since its digits are '0', which is not in the allowed set, it doesn't contribute to the count. So the initial call's contribution is 0, but the recursive calls proceed.\n\nSo the C function's base case is correct.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the ans is 1 only if the set of the digits of the current number (excluding leading zeros?) is exactly {'3','5','7'}. But in the C approach, the mask tracks whether each digit has been used. So the mask being 7 means all three are present, so the number has at least one of each. So that's correct.\n\nSo the C function can be written as:\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = 0;\n    if (mask == 7) { // all three digits present\n        count = 1;\n    }\n    for (int digit : {3,5,7}) { // need to loop over 3,5,7\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit ==3) new_mask |= 1<<0;\n        else if (digit ==5) new_mask |= 1<<1;\n        else if (digit ==7) new_mask |= 1<<2;\n        int new_num = current *10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, you can't have a loop like for (int digit : {3,5,7}), so I need to write a loop with each digit. So:\n\nfor (int i =0; i<3; i++) {\n    int digit;\n    if (i ==0) digit=3;\n    else if (i==1) digit=5;\n    else digit=7;\n    // process digit\n}\n\nAlternatively, use an array:\n\nint digits[] = {3,5,7};\nfor (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n    int digit = digits[i];\n    ...\n}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = 0;\n    if (mask == 7) {\n        count = 1;\n    }\n    int digits[] = {3,5,7};\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        int digit = digits[i];\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit ==3) new_mask |= 1<<0;\n        else if (digit ==5) new_mask |= 1<<1;\n        else new_mask |= 1<<2;\n        int new_num = current *10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but when current is 0, and we add digit 3, the new_num is 3, mask becomes 1 (bit0 set). Then, when we add another digit, say 5, the new_num is 35, mask becomes 1 | (1<<1) = 3. Then adding 7 would set mask to 7, so that number would count.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, the initial call is aaa(0,0, N). But wait, in the Python code, the initial call is aaa('0'), which is passed as a string. The first check is if int(n) > N. So when the initial call is '0', the current is 0, which is okay. The mask starts at 0, so the count is 0 (since mask is 0 !=7). Then, the function proceeds to add 3,5,7 digits.\n\nSo the initial call in C would be aaa(0,0, N). The result of that is the answer to print.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will first read n and a array, compute res as per first part, then set N = res, then compute the result of aaa(0,0,N), then print that.\n\nNow, handling the first part in C:\n\nFirst, read n from stdin. Then read n integers into array a.\n\nThen compute array b of size n, initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nb[a[i]-1] = i;\n\nThen compute res as sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in b.\n\nWait, in C, the absolute value can be done with abs(), but need to include <stdlib.h> for that.\n\nWait, but in C, the array indices are 0-based. So the code for the first part would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        b[a[i]-1] = i;\n    }\n    int res =0;\n    for (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n        res += abs(b[i] - b[i-1]);\n    }\n    // Now, second part:\n    int N = res;\n    int result = aaa(0, 0, N);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but the function aaa is recursive and needs to be defined before main. So the function definition should be before main, or after but with a prototype.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N);\n\nint main() {\n    // first part code here...\n    // then call aaa and print\n}\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    // function code here\n}\n\nWait, but in the function aaa, the parameters are current, mask, N. The N is passed each time, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the recursive calls, the N is fixed as the first part's res. So the function can take N as a parameter, which is passed down each time.\n\nNow, testing for possible overflows. Since N can be up to the first part's res, which could be large. But the problem's constraints are not given, but assuming that the numbers are manageable. However, the recursive approach may hit stack overflow for large N. But given that the problem is to translate the code as is, we proceed.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the function is called with '0', and then appends digits. The numbers can get large. For example, if N is very big, the recursion depth could be up to the number of digits, which for N up to 1e18 would be 18 digits, so recursion depth 18, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait, the digits array in the aaa function can be inside the loop. Also, the mask is updated correctly.\n\nWait, in the code for aaa:\n\nWhen digit is 3, new_mask is mask | (1<<0). Similarly for 5 and 7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let me check the initial example.\n\nSuppose the first part's res is 0. Then N is 0. The function aaa(0,0,0) is called.\n\nFirst, current is 0, which is <=0. mask is 0, so count starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each digit 3,5,7:\n\nnew_num is 0*10 +3 =3, which is >0, so the recursive call returns 0.\n\nSame for 5 and7. So the total count is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: suppose first part's res is 357. Then N=357.\n\nThe function would count numbers made of 3,5,7 digits and containing all three, up to 357.\n\nFor example, 357 itself is counted. 375, 537, etc., but numbers like 353 would not (no 7). So the count would include 357, 375, 537, 573, 735, 753, and any 3-digit numbers with all three digits, as well as longer numbers if possible. Wait, but 357 is 3 digits. So numbers like 335 would not be counted, but 357 is exactly 357, so it's included.\n\nWait, the maximum number is 357. So 357 is allowed. So the count would include all 3-digit numbers with 3,5,7 digits and all three present, and numbers with more digits but not exceeding 357. But since 357 is 3 digits, any 4-digit number would be over 357, so only 3-digit numbers.\n\nThe 3-digit numbers with all three digits are the permutations of 3,5,7. There are 6 such numbers (3! =6). So the count would be 6.\n\nSo if the first part's res is 357, the second part's output is 6.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting all together in C code.\n\nWait, in the first part, the array a is read as n integers. The code for that is okay.\n\nWait, in C, variable-length arrays (like int a[n];) are allowed in C99, but not in all compilers. To be safe, perhaps use malloc. But assuming the code is for a C99 compiler.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem may have constraints on n, but the user didn't specify, so proceed with the code as is.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N);\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        b[a[i] - 1] = i;\n    }\n    int res = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        res += abs(b[i] - b[i - 1]);\n    }\n    int N = res;\n    int result = aaa(0, 0, N);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint aaa(int current, int mask, int N) {\n    if (current > N) return 0;\n    int count = 0;\n    if (mask == 7) {\n        count = 1;\n    }\n    int digits[] = {3, 5, 7};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        int digit = digits[i];\n        int new_mask = mask;\n        if (digit == 3) new_mask |= 1 << 0;\n        else if (digit == 5) new_mask |= 1 << 1;\n        else new_mask |= 1 << 2;\n        int new_num = current * 10 + digit;\n        count += aaa(new_num, new_mask, N);\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nWait, but in the aaa function, when current is 0 and mask is 0, adding a digit like 3 gives new_num 3, mask 1. Then, when adding another digit, say 5, new_num is 35, mask 3. Then adding 7 gives new_num 357, mask 7. So that would count as 1. So the total for 357 would be 6, as expected.\n\nAnother test case: if N is 7, then the numbers that qualify are those with all three digits, but 7 is a single digit. So no numbers qualify. So the result is 0.\n\nAnother case: N=357, the count is 6.\n\nAnother case: N=753, which is 753. The numbers are all permutations of 3,5,7 (6 numbers), plus any 4-digit numbers? No, since 753 is 3 digits, so 4-digit numbers would be over. So total 6.\n\nAnother case: N= 353. Then the maximum number is 353. The numbers must have all three digits. The possible numbers are 357 (over 353?), no. 357 is 357 which is less than 353? No, 357 is larger than 353. So 357 is over. So the valid numbers would be those permutations where the number is <=353.\n\nWait, 353 is the N. So numbers like 353 has digits 3,5,3 \u2192 missing 7, so not counted. So the valid numbers would be those permutations where the number is <=353 and contains all three digits.\n\nPossible numbers:\n\n357 is over 353 \u2192 no.\n\n375 \u2192 375>353 \u2192 no.\n\n537 \u2192 537>353 \u2192 yes, but 537 is 537>353 \u2192 yes, but 537 is larger than 353 \u2192 no. Wait, 537 is 537 which is bigger than 353 \u2192 so not counted.\n\nWait, so the only possible 3-digit numbers with all three digits and <=353 are those starting with 3, then next digits 5 and 7 in some order, but the third digit must be 7 to make it 357, which is over. So no numbers qualify. So the count would be 0.\n\nHmm, so the code would return 0 for N=353.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the aaa function, when current is 0, and we add 3, the new_num is 3, mask is 1. Then adding 5 gives 35, mask 3. Then adding 7 gives 357, mask 7. So that is counted. But if N is 353, then 357 is over, so the recursive call for 357 would return 0. So the path 3\u21925\u21927 would contribute 0. So the total count would be 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
