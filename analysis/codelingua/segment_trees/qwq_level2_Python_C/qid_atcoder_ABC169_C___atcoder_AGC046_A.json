Therefore, the code must use long long for a, b, x. So let's adjust: Parsing sa as a long long:\n\nlong long a;\nsscanf(sa, \"%lld\", &a);\n\nSimilarly for the b part:\n\ndouble sb_float = atof(sb);\nlong long b = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nWait, but in C, casting to long long would be better. Wait, the code for b is:\n\nb = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1); Wait, but in Python, it's int(...), which truncates towards zero. The same as C's cast to integer types. So that's okay. Then, x is (a * b) / 100. Since a and b are long long, their product is a long long, divided by 100. Then, compute the GCD of 360 and x. Since x can be up to (1e18 * 1e11)/100 \u2192 but 360 is small, so the GCD can be computed with the Euclidean algorithm even for large x.\n\nThe GCD function can be written for long long:\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long long t = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = t;\n    }\n    return a;\n} So the code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long long t = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = t;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char sa[100], sb[100]; scanf(\"%99s %99s \", sa, sb);\n\n    long long a;\n    sscanf(sa, \"%lld\", &a);\n\n    double sb_float = atof(sb);\n    long long b = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\n    long long x = (a * b) / 100;\n\n    long long g = gcd(360, x);\n    long long result = 360 / g;\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in the first part, the original code uses input().split(), which splits on any whitespace. The scanf with %s %s would read two words, which is correct. Testing some cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"5 12.34\"\n\nThen, a =5, b = 12.34 *100 = 1234 \u2192 5 *1234 =6170 \u2192 divided by 100 \u219261.7 \u2192 integer division gives 61. Then x is 61. Then compute GCD(360,61). Since 61 is prime and doesn't divide 360, GCD is 1. So 360/1 =360. So the output is 360. Another test case:\n\nSuppose input is \"360 1.0\" \u2192 then a=360, b=100 \u2192 x = 360 *100 /100 =360. GCD(360,360)=360 \u2192 360/360 =1. So output is 1.",

Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. The main function reads two inputs: sa and sb. Sa is a string, then converted to an integer a. Then, sb is a bit tricky. It's converted to a float, multiplied by 100, then added 0.1 before converting to an integer. The comment says to avoid any I/O except first and last, so I need to process this in C without intermediate I/O.\n\nWait, the first part of File 1's code has some imports and functions, but the actual processing is in the main function. The key part is getting a and b correctly. Let me see:\n\nIn File 1, after splitting the input into sa and sb, a is straightforward. For b, they do int(float(sb)*100 +0.1). That's probably to handle the decimal part correctly, like converting \"12.34\" into 1234. The +0.1 is for rounding when converting from float to int, to avoid truncation errors. So in C, how to parse a string like \"12.34\" into an integer of 1234?\n\nHmm, in C, perhaps using sscanf to split the string into the integer and fractional parts. Alternatively, process the string manually. Let's think: the input for File 1 is a line with two parts, like \"5 12.34\", so the second part is the sb. To parse that into an integer of 1234, we can read the entire string, find the '.' and split into before and after, then combine. For example, \"12.34\" becomes 1234. If there's no decimal point, like \"5\", then it's 500. Wait, but the original code uses float(sb)*100, so \"5\" would become 500. So the code in Python does that.\n\nSo in C, to parse the second part:\n\nSuppose the input line is read into a buffer. Split into sa and sb parts. Then process sb:\n\nRead the sb string. Find the '.' character. If present, take the part before and after. The total is (before_part * 100) + (after_part padded to two digits). But if the decimal part is less than two digits, like \"12.3\", then it's 1230? Or maybe the code in Python's approach is better. Let's see:\n\nIn Python, converting to float first. For \"12.3\", float is 12.3, multiply by 100 gives 1230.0, then adding 0.1 and converting to int gives 1230. So that's correct. So in C, perhaps the best way is to read the entire string, then process it as a string to split into the integer and fractional parts.\n\nAlternatively, use sscanf with a format that captures the parts. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the sb string is stored in a char array. Let's say:\n\nchar sb_str[100];\n// read into it, then parse.\n\nWe can do something like:\n\nint integer_part, fractional_part;\nif (sscanf(sb_str, \"%d.%d\", &integer_part, &fractional_part) == 2) {\n    // then fractional_part is up to two digits? Wait, but if the fractional part has more digits, like 12.345, then fractional_part would be 345, but when multiplied by 100, that's 12345, but the code in Python would do 12.345 *100 = 1234.5, then adding 0.1 gives 1234.6, so integer part is 1234. Wait, but in the code, it's int(12.345 *100 +0.1) \u2192 1234.5 +0.1 is 1234.6 \u2192 int is 1234. Hmm, but maybe the code is trying to round to the nearest integer. Alternatively, perhaps the code is to avoid floating point inaccuracies by using string parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in C, the best way is to read the entire string, then process it as a string to get the two digits after decimal. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, use atof to get the float, then multiply by 100, add 0.1, cast to int. But using atof could have precision issues, but maybe for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nWait, the original code uses float(sb), which in Python is a float. So in C, using atof would be similar. Let's see:\n\nIn C:\n\ndouble sb_float = atof(sb_str);\nint b = (int)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nWait, but in Python, the code is int(float(sb)*100 +0.1). So in C, that would be the same. So perhaps that's manageable.\n\nSo for File 1's processing, the steps are:\n\nRead the input line into two parts, sa and sb. Convert sa to a (integer). Convert sb to a float, multiply by 100, add 0.1, cast to int to get b. Then compute a*b / 100, and print that as the output of File 1. But since in the sequence, the output of File 1 is the input to File 2, but in the C program, we have to chain them without I/O in between.\n\nWait, the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the first file's output is the input to the second. But in the C program, we can compute the intermediate steps in memory.\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nFile1's input is the user's input. The output of File1 is a * b // 100. Then, that output is the input to File2, which takes that number (x) and computes 360 / gcd(360, x). The final output is that result.\n\nWait, let me check the two files:\n\nFile1's main code:\n\nsa, sb = input().split()\na = int(sa)\nb = int(float(sb)*100 +0.1)\nprint(a * b // 100)\n\nSo the output of File1 is (a*b)//100. Then, File2 takes that number as input x, and computes 360 // gcd(360, x). So the final output is that.\n\nTherefore, the C program must read the initial input (the two strings), compute the intermediate value (a*b//100), then compute the second part using that value, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n1. Read the input line (the two parts, sa and sb).\n\n2. Parse sa into a (integer).\n\n3. Parse sb into a float, multiply by 100, add 0.1, cast to int to get b.\n\n4. Compute temp = (a * b) / 100. But since in Python it's integer division with //, so in C, (a*b) is an integer, divided by 100. So (a*b) / 100, using integer division (since a and b are integers, so a*b is integer, then divided by 100. So in C, (a*b)/100 would be integer division.\n\nWait, but in Python, a and b are integers, so a*b is an integer, and then divided by 100 with integer division (//). So in C, same.\n\nSo temp = (a * b) / 100; but in C, since a and b are integers, the multiplication is integer, and division is integer division (truncated towards zero). So that's correct.\n\nThen, the temp is the x for the second part.\n\nThen, compute the gcd of 360 and x, then compute 360 divided by that gcd, and output that.\n\nSo the C program needs to:\n\n- Read the input (the two strings).\n\n- Compute a, b as per the first file.\n\n- Compute x = (a*b)/100.\n\n- Compute the gcd of 360 and x.\n\n- Compute 360 / gcd, then output that.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this in C.\n\nFirst, handling the input. The first part is to read the entire line. Since in Python, input().split() splits on whitespace. So in C, perhaps read the entire line into a buffer, then split into two parts.\n\nAlternatively, read two strings. But since the second part may contain a '.' (like \"12.34\"), we can read them as two strings.\n\nWait, in C, using scanf with \"%s %s\" would read the two parts. But if the second part has a '.' it's okay. So:\n\nchar sa[100], sb[100];\nscanf(\"%99s %99s\", sa, sb);\n\nThen, a is atoi(sa).\n\nFor the sb part, we need to parse it as a float. So:\n\ndouble sb_float = atof(sb);\n\nThen, compute b as (int)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nWait, but in C, the cast to int truncates towards zero. So adding 0.1 before casting would round to the nearest integer if the decimal is 0.1 or more. For example, 12.345 *100 = 1234.5 \u2192 adding 0.1 gives 1234.6 \u2192 cast to int is 1234. Wait, but in Python, the code does the same. Let me see:\n\nIn Python, float(\"12.345\") is 12.345, multiply by 100 \u2192 1234.5, add 0.1 \u2192 1234.6 \u2192 int is 1234. So same as C's cast. So that's correct.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen compute x = (a * b) / 100. Since a and b are integers, their product is an integer, divided by 100. So in C, (a*b)/100.\n\nThen compute the gcd of 360 and x. The second part of the original code uses math.gcd, which in Python returns the greatest common divisor. In C, we need to implement the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nWait, the second Python file uses from math import gcd, so the function is the same as math.gcd. The C standard library does not have a gcd function, so we need to implement it.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm for GCD:\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nBut since 360 and x can be positive, we can assume they are positive here. So the function is okay.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe steps in C:\n\nRead sa and sb.\n\nParse a as atoi(sa).\n\nParse sb into a double, compute b as (int)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1).\n\nCompute x = (a * b) / 100.\n\nCompute g = gcd(360, x).\n\nResult is 360 / g.\n\nThen print that result.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int t = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = t;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char sa[100], sb[100];\n    scanf(\"%99s %99s\", sa, sb); // Read the two parts.\n\n    int a = atoi(sa);\n\n    double sb_float = atof(sb);\n    int b = (int)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\n    int x = (a * b) / 100;\n\n    int g = gcd(360, x);\n    int result = 360 / g;\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but need to check for possible overflows. For example, a and b could be large, but given that in the original code, the input is read via LMIIS (which is list of integers) but in the first file, the first part is an integer, and the second is a float. So perhaps the problem constraints are such that a and b are within reasonable limits. But in C, multiplying two integers could overflow. However, since the original code uses Python which handles big integers, but in the problem's context, perhaps the inputs are such that a*b doesn't overflow an int. Assuming that the problem's test cases are within 32-bit integers, this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the first file's code, the b is converted from a float. Let's see, for example, if the input is \"1e9 999.99\", then b would be 99999, so a*b would be 1e9 * 99999 = 99999000000, which is 9.9999e10, which is way larger than 2^31 (about 2e9). So in that case, the product would overflow a 32-bit int. Hmm, but the original code uses Python which can handle big integers, so in C, perhaps we need to use long long to prevent overflow.\n\nWait, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. So if the product a*b in the first step is too big for an int, then in C, using int would overflow, leading to wrong results. But in Python, it would handle it as a big integer. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, so perhaps in the code, a and b are stored as integers, but their product could be up to 1e18 (if a and b are up to 1e9 each). So in C, we need to use 64-bit integers.\n\nWait, let's see the original code's first part:\n\nIn Python, a is an integer, and b is an integer (after conversion). So a*b is an integer, and then divided by 100. So in C, to avoid overflow, we can cast a and b to long long before multiplying.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nint a = atoi(sa);\ndouble sb_float = atof(sb);\nint b = (int)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nlong long x = ( ( (long long)a ) * b ) / 100;\n\nWait, but then x is a long long. Then, when computing gcd(360, x), but the gcd function takes int parameters. So need to adjust the gcd function to handle larger numbers, but since 360 is fixed, perhaps the GCD can be computed with x as a long long.\n\nWait, the GCD of 360 and x. Since 360 is a constant, the GCD can be computed as GCD(360, x mod 360). But perhaps better to write the gcd function for integers, but if x is a long long, then the function needs to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, since 360 is fixed, perhaps compute the GCD of 360 and x using the Euclidean algorithm with x as a long long.\n\nWait, the problem is that the original code's second part uses x as the input to the second program, which is the output of the first. So in the original code, the first program's output is a * b // 100, which in Python can be a very large integer, but when passed to the second program, it's read as an integer (using input() which reads as a string, then converted to int). So in the second program, x is an integer, which can be up to (a*b//100). So in C, the x must be stored as a 64-bit integer to prevent overflow.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, the variables a and b should be of type long long, and x as well.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo revised steps:\n\nRead sa and sb.\n\na is parsed as a long long (since atoi returns int, but maybe the input is larger than 2^31-1). Wait, but atoi returns an int. So if the input is larger than INT_MAX, it would overflow. So better to use strtol to parse the string into a long long.\n\nAh, right. So to parse sa into a long long, perhaps using strtol.\n\nSimilarly for the second part, but b is computed from the float, which may be up to, say, 1e9 * 100 = 1e11, but stored as an int. Wait, but in the code, b is an int, but if the float is large, like 1e9, then 1e9 *100 is 1e11, which is way beyond 2^31 (which is about 2e9). So in that case, the code would overflow.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that in the original code, the variables can be arbitrarily large, but in C, we have to use 64-bit integers to handle that.\n\nTherefore, the code must use long long for a, b, x.\n\nSo let's adjust:\n\nParsing sa as a long long:\n\nlong long a;\nsscanf(sa, \"%lld\", &a);\n\nSimilarly for the b part:\n\ndouble sb_float = atof(sb);\nlong long b = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nWait, but in C, casting to long long would be better.\n\nWait, the code for b is:\n\nb = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\nWait, but in Python, it's int(...), which truncates towards zero. The same as C's cast to integer types. So that's okay.\n\nThen, x is (a * b) / 100. Since a and b are long long, their product is a long long, divided by 100.\n\nThen, compute the GCD of 360 and x. Since x can be up to (1e18 * 1e11)/100 \u2192 but 360 is small, so the GCD can be computed with the Euclidean algorithm even for large x.\n\nThe GCD function can be written for long long:\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long long t = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = t;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nSo the code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long long t = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = t;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char sa[100], sb[100];\n    scanf(\"%99s %99s\", sa, sb);\n\n    long long a;\n    sscanf(sa, \"%lld\", &a);\n\n    double sb_float = atof(sb);\n    long long b = (long long)(sb_float * 100 + 0.1);\n\n    long long x = (a * b) / 100;\n\n    long long g = gcd(360, x);\n    long long result = 360 / g;\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, the original code uses input().split(), which splits on any whitespace. The scanf with %s %s would read two words, which is correct.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"5 12.34\"\n\nThen, a =5, b = 12.34 *100 = 1234 \u2192 5 *1234 =6170 \u2192 divided by 100 \u219261.7 \u2192 integer division gives 61. Then x is 61.\n\nThen compute GCD(360,61). Since 61 is prime and doesn't divide 360, GCD is 1. So 360/1 =360. So the output is 360.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose input is \"360 1.0\" \u2192 then a=360, b=100 \u2192 x = 360 *100 /100 =360. GCD(360,360)=360 \u2192 360/360 =1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test case where the decimal part is tricky:\n\nInput \"1 0.99\" \u2192 sb is \"0.99\" \u2192 float is 0.99 \u2192 *100 \u219299 \u2192 +0.1 \u219299.1 \u2192 cast to long long is 99. So b=99. Then x = 1*99 /100 \u2192 0.99 \u2192 integer division gives 0. Then GCD(360,0) \u2192 but wait, GCD with 0?\n\nWait, in the GCD function, when b is 0, the loop stops and returns a. So if x is 0, then GCD(360,0) is 360. So 360 /360 \u21921. But in this case, the first program's output would be 0, so the second program's input is 0. Then 360//gcd(360,0). The GCD of 360 and 0 is 360, so 360/360 =1. So the output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the decimal part is 0.005:\n\nInput \"1 0.005\" \u2192 float is 0.005 \u2192 *100 \u21920.5 \u2192 adding 0.1 gives 0.6 \u2192 cast to long long is 0. So b=0. Then x is 0 \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, but in Python, 0.005 as a float may not be exactly 0.005, but in the code, adding 0.1 before casting to int would give 0.6 \u2192 0. So the code would proceed.\n\nHmm, but in C, atof(\"0.005\") is 0.005, so 0.005 *100 =0.05 \u2192 adding 0.1 gives 0.15 \u2192 cast to long long is 0. So same as Python.\n\nAnother case where the decimal is 0.9999999999999999 (due to float precision), but in code, adding 0.1 would push it to 100.09999999999999 \u2192 cast to int would be 100. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code uses long long to prevent overflow. The only possible issue is if the input for sa is too big for a long long, but assuming the problem constraints are within 64-bit integers, this should be okay.\n\nTherefore, the final C code is as above."
