First, we need a helper function to convert a 3-character string (like \"TTT\") into an index. For example, each character can be mapped to 0-3 (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). The index for a string s is s[0] * 16 + s[1] *4 + s[2]. Wait, for example, \"TTT\" would be T (3) for each character: 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63. So the function to convert a string to an index would be:\n\nint toIndex(char *s) {\n\n    int idx = 0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n        switch(s[i]) {\n\n            case 'A': idx = idx *4 +0; break;\n\n            case 'C': idx = idx *4 +1; break;\n\n            case 'G': idx = idx *4 +2; break;\n\n            case 'T': idx = idx *4 +3; break;\n\n            default: // error?\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return idx;\n\n} Wait, but in C, strings are null-terminated, so the function would need to process the first three characters.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Python programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Python file does.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1. It's a dynamic programming problem, probably counting something with constraints. The function ok checks if adding a character to the last three characters (plus the new one) would form 'AGC' in any of the four possible permutations. The main function uses DFS with memoization to compute the number of valid sequences of length n, modulo 1e9+7. The initial call is with 'TTT' as the last3, but since the first three are T's, maybe they are placeholders since the actual characters start from the first step?\n\nWait, the first function's ok function takes last4, which is the last three plus the new character? Wait, the parameters in the code: the ok function is called with last3 + c, which would be four characters. So the ok function checks the last four characters (the previous three plus the new one) for any forbidden pattern. The function ok checks all four possible swaps of adjacent characters in the last four, to see if any of those permutations contain 'AGC'. If any do, then it's invalid.\n\nHmm, the code uses memoization with a list of dictionaries. The memo array is of size n+1, each element is a dictionary mapping last3 strings to the count. The DFS function is recursive, building up the sequence step by step, adding each possible character (A, C, G, T) and checking if it's allowed.\n\nThe second Python file (File 2) processes a string of 'g' and 'p' characters. It counts a score based on the counts of g and p. The rules are a bit tricky. For each character in the input string:\n\n- If it's 'g', then if the current (num_g - num_p) is positive, adding this g would increase the difference, so the score increases by 1, and num_p increments? Wait, no. Wait the code says:\n\nWhen x is 'g', if num_g - num_p >0, then we add to score and increment num_p? That seems odd. Let me read the code again:\n\nIn the loop for x in s:\n\nif x is 'g':\n    if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n        score +=1\n        num_p +=1\n    else:\n        num_g +=1\nelif x is 'p':\n    if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n        num_p +=1\n    else:\n        score -=1\n        num_g +=1\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFor 'g' case:\n\nIf the current difference (g - p) is positive, then adding this 'g' would make the difference even more positive. But the code adds to the score and increments p? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, maybe the logic is that when you have a 'g', if the current difference is positive, then the 'g' contributes to the score, so you add 1 to the score, and then you count this 'g' as part of the p count? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the variables are being tracked in a way that when you process a 'g', you decide whether to treat it as a 'g' or a 'p' based on the current counts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a programming contest where the rules are specific. For example, in some problem, when you have a 'g', if the current number of g's exceeds p's, then this g adds to the score and is counted as a p? Or maybe the problem is about balancing the counts so that the score is the difference between g and p, but with some conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is from a problem where the score is calculated as follows: whenever the number of g's exceeds p's, adding a g increases the score, but when adding a p, if the current difference is positive, then the p doesn't affect the score, but if it's not, then the p reduces the score. Hmm, maybe the problem is similar to the one where you have to count the number of times the current count of g exceeds p, but the code here is tracking the score in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a specific contest problem, like the AtCoder problem where the score is calculated based on the current counts. Let me think: the code's logic for 'g' is:\n\nWhen you encounter a 'g', if the current (g - p) is positive, then you add 1 to the score and increment p instead of g. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nIn the 'g' case, if (num_g - num_p) >0, then:\n\nscore +=1\n\nnum_p +=1\n\nWait, so instead of adding to num_g, it's adding to num_p? That's strange. So the 'g' is being treated as a 'p' in this case, but contributing to the score. That's a bit odd. Maybe the problem requires that whenever the current difference is positive, the next 'g' is counted as a 'p' to prevent the difference from getting too big, but the score is adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a specific problem where the score is calculated as the number of times the current count of g exceeds p, but the code is trying to track that. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code for 'g' case:\n\nif (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n    score +=1\n\n    num_p +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    num_g +=1\n\nWait, so when the current difference is positive, adding a 'g' would make the difference even more, but instead of adding to num_g, it's adding to num_p, so the difference becomes (num_g) - (num_p +1) = (num_g - num_p) -1. So the difference decreases by 1. But the score increases by 1. So perhaps the score is the number of times the current difference was positive before adding this character, and then the character is treated as a p to prevent the difference from increasing further?\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is such that whenever the current count of g exceeds p, the next 'g' is converted to a 'p' and adds to the score. So the score counts how many times this conversion happened. The code's logic seems to be doing that.\n\nIn any case, the second program takes a string of 'g's and 'p's and computes a score based on these rules.\n\nNow, the user wants to combine these two Python programs into a single C program. The first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input to the second program. Wait, but looking at the code:\n\nWait, the first Python program's output is the result of the dfs function, which is a number modulo 1e9+7. The second program takes input as a string (s = list(input())). So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string of 'g's and 'p's. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number, and the second program expects a string. That would be a problem unless the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number (the result of the first program's print statement). The second program's input is a string (since it's using input() which is read as a string). So this suggests that the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but in the first Python code, the first program's output is a number. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the first Python code again.\n\nLooking at the first Python code:\n\nThe first program's print statement is print(dfs(0, 'TTT')). The dfs function returns an integer (the count modulo mod). So the first program's output is an integer. The second program expects a string (since it's taking input as s = list(input())). So the second program's input is the first program's output, which is a number. But that would be a string of digits, which would be processed as a list of characters (digits), but the code in the second program is looking for 'g' and 'p' characters. That can't be right. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the two programs are supposed to be run in sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the first's output is a number, and the second's input is a string. That would not make sense unless the first's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's. But according to the code given, the first program's output is a number. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two programs are part of a chain where the first's output is the input to the second, but the second's input is a number. But the second program's code is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. That's conflicting. Hmm, this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but according to the code given, it's not. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe the two programs are not supposed to be connected in that way, but the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both steps in sequence, with the first part's output being the input to the second part's processing. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the first program is generating a string of characters (like a sequence of ACGT) and the second program is processing that string. But in the first Python code, the output is a number, not a string. So that can't be. So maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both tasks, but the first part's output is not used as input to the second part. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But given the code, that's impossible unless there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program is supposed to generate a string, but in the code provided, it's outputting a number. Maybe there's a mistake in the code provided. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first Python code:\n\nThe first program's code is:\n\ndef ok(last4):\n    for i in range(4):\n        t = list(last4)\n        if i >= 1:\n            t[i], t[i - 1] = t[i - 1], t[i]\n        if ''.join(t).count('AGC') >= 1:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef dfs(...):\n    ... returns a count mod mod.\n\nn = int(input())\nmod = 10**9+7\nmemo = [{} for ...]\nprint(dfs(0, 'TTT'))\n\nSo the first program's output is the count of valid sequences of length n, avoiding certain patterns. The second program takes a string of 'g's and 'p's and computes a score. So unless the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, which it isn't, the two can't be connected. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps the two programs are supposed to be run independently, but the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both, but the second program's input is from the first's output. But that would require the first's output to be a string of 'g's and 'p's, which it's not. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two programs are part of a problem where the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is a number. But the second program's code is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed with the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both tasks, but the first part's output is not used as input to the second part. But the problem says that the output of each is used as input to the next, so that's required.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to re-examine the code again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a string, but in the code provided, it's a number. Let me check the first program's code again. The first program's print statement is print(dfs(0, 'TTT')). The dfs function returns an integer (the count mod mod). So the first program's output is a number. The second program's input is a string (since it's using input() which is read as a string). So the second program's input is the first program's output, which is a number. So the second program would process that number as a string of digits, but the code in the second program is looking for 'g's and 'p's. That would not work. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps the two programs are not supposed to be connected in that way. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string, but the code is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the second program's input is a number, but the code is written to process 'g's and 'p's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are part of different problems, and the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both, but the first part's output is not used as input to the second part. But the problem says that the output of each is used as input to the next, so that's required.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed with the given code. Maybe the first program's output is a string, but the code is written wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the second program's input is a number, and the code is written to process digits. Let me see the second program's code again.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\ns = list(input())\nnum_g, num_p = 0, 0\nscore =0\nfor x in s:\n    if x == 'g':\n        ... \n    elif x == 'p':\n        ...\n    else:\n        # what if the input has other characters? The code doesn't handle that.\n\nSo if the first program's output is a number like '123', then the second program would process each character as '1', '2', '3', which are not 'g' or 'p', so they would be ignored (since the code only checks for 'g' and 'p'). The score would remain 0. But that's probably not the intended behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but the code is written to output a number. So perhaps the first program is supposed to generate a string, but the code is incorrect. For example, maybe the first program is supposed to generate all valid sequences and output one of them, but the code is counting them instead. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the two programs are supposed to be run independently, and the user wants a C program that does both tasks, but the second program's input is from the user, not the first program's output. But the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next, so that's required.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the first program's output is a number, and the second program's input is that number, but the second program's code is expecting a string of 'g's and 'p's. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two programs are part of a problem where the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is a number. For example, the second program's code is supposed to process a number, but the code given is for a string. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code provided. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to take the first program's output (a number) and process it as a string of digits, but the code is written for 'g's and 'p's. That would not work. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since I can't proceed without clarification, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the two programs are separate, and the user wants a C program that does both tasks in sequence, but the second program's input is not from the first's output. But the problem says that the output of each is used as input to the next, so that's required. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'ACGT's, but the code is written to output a number. So maybe the first program is supposed to generate a valid sequence, but the code is counting them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program is part of a problem where the output is a number, and the second program is part of a different problem, and the user wants to combine them into a single C program that runs both, but the second program's input is from the user, not the first's output. But the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next, so that's required. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given code, even if there's a contradiction, and see what can be done. \n\nAssuming that the first program's output is a number, and the second program's input is that number as a string, but the second program's code is expecting 'g's and 'p's, then the second program would process the digits as characters, but since they are not 'g' or 'p', the score would be 0. But that's probably not intended. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but the code is written to output a number. So maybe the first program's code is incorrect. For example, maybe the first program is supposed to generate a string, but the code is written to count. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program is part of a problem where the output is a number, and the second program is part of a different problem, and the user wants to combine them into a single C program that does both, but the second program's input is from the user.

Since I have to proceed, perhaps I should proceed with the given code and see what can be done. \n\nNow, the user wants to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. The first program's output is the input to the second. \n\nSo the first program's output is a number (from the first Python code), which is then the input to the second program. The second program's input is a string (the digits of the number). \n\nSo the C program should first compute the first program's result (the count), then pass that as a string to the second program's processing. \n\nTherefore, the C program will first compute the first part's result (the count), then convert that number to a string, and then process that string with the second part's logic. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n from input (for the first part).\n\n2. Compute the count using the first program's logic.\n\n3. Convert the count to a string (as a character array).\n\n4. Process that string with the second program's logic to compute the score.\n\n5. Output the score.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string of 'g's and 'p's. But the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input would be the digits of that number. So the second program's processing would treat those digits as characters, but since they are not 'g' or 'p', the score would be 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'ACGT's, but the code is written to output a number. So perhaps the first program's code is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string of 'g's and 'p's, but the code is written to output a number. So the code is wrong. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since I have to proceed, perhaps I should proceed with the given code and see what can be done. \n\nAssuming that the first program's output is a number, and the second program's input is that number as a string, then the C program will need to:\n\n- Read n from input (for the first part).\n\n- Compute the count (first part's result).\n\n- Convert that count to a string (e.g., as a character array).\n\n- Process that string with the second part's logic (the second program's code).\n\n- Output the resulting score.\n\nSo the C program will have two main parts: the first part computes the count, the second part processes the count's string representation to compute the score. \n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C.\n\nFirst, the first part (the first Python program) is a dynamic programming problem. The code uses memoization with a list of dictionaries. In C, we need to represent this memoization. Since the maximum n can be up to, say, 80 (since the problem is similar to some AtCoder problems where n is up to 80), we can precompute the memo tables.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nThe function ok checks if adding a character to the last three (making four characters) would form 'AGC' in any of the four possible adjacent swaps. \n\nThe function dfs is a recursive function with memoization. \n\nIn C, recursion might be tricky for large n, but given that n is up to 80, it's manageable. Alternatively, we can implement it iteratively. \n\nAlternatively, since the memo is stored as a list of dictionaries, in C, we can represent the memo as a 2D array. Since the last3 can be any of the 4^3 = 64 possible 3-character strings (each character is A, C, G, T), we can map each possible last3 string to an index (0-63). \n\nSo first, we need to map the 3-character strings to indices. For example, each character can be represented as 0 (A), 1 (C), 2 (G), 3 (T). So the 3-character string can be converted to a number between 0 and 63 (since 4^3=64). \n\nThus, for the memo, we can have a 2D array: memo[cur][index], where index is the 3-character string's index. \n\nThe ok function can be implemented as follows: given a 4-character string (last3 + c), check if any of the four possible swaps (swapping adjacent characters) results in 'AGC' being present. \n\nWait, the ok function in Python takes last4 (the four characters) and checks for any of the four possible swaps (for i from 0 to 3, swapping i and i-1 if possible). Wait, the code loops over i in 0-3, and for each i, creates a copy of last4, then if i >=1, swaps t[i] and t[i-1]. Then checks if the joined string contains 'AGC'. \n\nWait, the code is checking for any permutation of the four characters where swapping adjacent characters (once) would create 'AGC'. \n\nWait, the code is checking for any of the four possible swaps (each step swaps adjacent characters once). For example, for the four characters, the code tries swapping each possible pair of adjacent characters (once) and checks if any of those permutations contains 'AGC'. \n\nWait, the code is doing this for each of the four positions (i from 0 to 3). For each i, it creates a copy of the last4 list, then if i >=1, swaps the i-th and (i-1)-th elements. Then checks if the resulting string contains 'AGC'. \n\nWait, the loop is for i in range(4). For each i, the code does:\n\nt = list(last4)  # copy the list\n\nif i >=1:\n\n    swap t[i] and t[i-1]\n\nthen check if the joined string has 'AGC' in it. \n\nSo for each of the four positions, it swaps the current element with the previous (if possible), and checks if that creates 'AGC'. \n\nWait, for i=0, the code doesn't swap anything, so the original string is checked. \n\nFor i=1, swap 1 and 0.\n\nFor i=2, swap 2 and 1.\n\nFor i=3, swap 3 and 2.\n\nSo the code is checking the original string and the four possible single adjacent swaps. \n\nIf any of those four permutations contains 'AGC', then the function returns False (invalid). \n\nSo the ok function returns True only if none of those permutations contain 'AGC'. \n\nThus, the function is checking that adding the new character (the fourth character) doesn't create a forbidden pattern in any of the four possible adjacent swaps. \n\nNow, to implement this in C, for a given four-character string (last3 + c), we can generate each of the four possible swapped versions (including the original) and check for 'AGC' in any of them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way, but for now, let's proceed with the straightforward approach. \n\nNow, the first part's code in C:\n\nWe need to compute the count using dynamic programming with memoization. \n\nThe steps for the first part:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize memo as a 2D array. Since the maximum n is up to 80, and the last3 can be 64 possibilities, the memo can be an array of size (n+1) x 64, storing the counts modulo 1e9+7. \n\nThe base case is when cur == n, return 1. \n\nThe recursive function can be implemented with memoization. \n\nAlternatively, since C doesn't have dictionaries, we can precompute the indices for the last3 strings. \n\nFirst, we need a helper function to convert a 3-character string (like \"TTT\") into an index. \n\nFor example, each character can be mapped to 0-3 (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). \n\nThe index for a string s is s[0] * 16 + s[1] *4 + s[2]. \n\nWait, for example, \"TTT\" would be T (3) for each character: 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63. \n\nSo the function to convert a string to an index would be:\n\nint toIndex(char *s) {\n\n    int idx = 0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n        switch(s[i]) {\n\n            case 'A': idx = idx *4 +0; break;\n\n            case 'C': idx = idx *4 +1; break;\n\n            case 'G': idx = idx *4 +2; break;\n\n            case 'T': idx = idx *4 +3; break;\n\n            default: // error?\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return idx;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in C, strings are null-terminated, so the function would need to process the first three characters. \n\nAlternatively, since the last3 is always 3 characters, we can pass a 3-character array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can handle it. \n\nNow, the memo array can be a 2D array of size (n+1) x 64. \n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"). \n\nWait, the initial last3 is \"TTT\", which is three 'T's. \n\nSo the first step is to compute the count using the DP approach. \n\nNow, the second part of the code (the second Python program) processes a string of 'g's and 'p's. \n\nThe second part's code in C would need to process the string (the first program's output as a string) and compute the score. \n\nBut the first program's output is a number, so the second part's input is the string representation of that number. \n\nThus, the C program will first compute the count, then convert it to a string, then process that string. \n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the count using the first part's logic.\n\n3. Convert the count to a string (e.g., using sprintf).\n\n4. Process that string with the second part's logic to compute the score.\n\n5. Output the score.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the first part's code in C:\n\nImplementing the DP with memoization. \n\nWe can represent the memo as a 2D array of integers. \n\nThe function to compute the count would be something like:\n\nint mod = 1e9 +7;\n\nint memo[81][64]; // assuming n up to 80.\n\nvoid init_memo() {\n\n    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++) {\n\n            memo[i][j] = -1; // uninitialized\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint dfs(int cur, int last3_idx) {\n\n    if (cur == n) return 1;\n\n    if (memo[cur][last3_idx] != -1) return memo[cur][last3_idx];\n\n    int ret =0;\n\n    for (char c : {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}) {\n\n        // construct the new last3: last3[1:] + c\n\n        // need to compute the new last3 index.\n\n        // the current last3 is represented by last3_idx.\n\n        // the new last3 is the last two characters of the current last3 plus the new c.\n\n        // To get the new last3's index:\n\n        // the current last3 is s[0], s[1], s[2]\n\n        // new last3 is s[1], s[2], c.\n\n        // So to compute the new index:\n\n        // extract the first two characters of the current last3.\n\n        // but since we have the index, we can compute it.\n\n        // Let's first get the current last3's characters.\n\n        // To get the characters from the index:\n\n        int a = (last3_idx / 16) %4;\n\n        int b = (last3_idx /4) %4;\n\n        int c_val = (last3_idx %4);\n\n        // new last3 is b, c_val, new_char (the c's value)\n\n        // new_char is the value of the current character (A=0, etc.)\n\n        int new_char = 0;\n\n        switch(c) {\n\n            case 'A': new_char =0; break;\n\n            case 'C': new_char =1; break;\n\n            case 'G': new_char =2; break;\n\n            case 'T': new_char =3; break;\n\n        }\n\n        int new_last3_idx = (b *16) + (c_val *4) + new_char;\n\n        // Now, check if adding this new character is allowed.\n\n        // Need to check the ok function.\n\n        // The four characters are the previous last3 (s[0], s[1], s[2]) plus the new_char (c).\n\n        // So the four characters are s[0], s[1], s[2], new_char.\n\n        // Need to check if any of the four possible swaps (including original) contains 'AGC'.\n\n        // To do this, we can generate the four possible permutations and check.\n\n        // Let's create the four-character string.\n\n        char four_chars[4] = {a, b, c_val, new_char};\n\n        // Wait, but these are the indices (0-3) for each character. Need to convert to actual characters.\n\n        // Wait, the four characters are the previous last3 (three chars) plus the new_char (fourth).\n\n        // So the four characters are s[0], s[1], s[2], new_char.\n\n        // To check the ok function, we need to see if any of the four possible swaps (as per the Python code) creates 'AGC'.\n\n        // Let's first convert the four characters to their actual letters.\n\n        char chars[4];\n\n        chars[0] = (a ==0 ?

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four characters can be represented as a string, and then for each of the four possibilities (swapping adjacent pairs), check if any of them contains 'AGC'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor the four characters (chars[0], chars[1], chars[2], chars[3]), we need to check all four possibilities (original and the three swaps):\n\nWait, the loop in the Python code is for i in 0..3:\n\nfor each i, create a copy of the four characters, swap i and i-1 if i >=1, then check if 'AGC' is present in the resulting string.\n\nSo for each of the four cases (i=0,1,2,3):\n\n- i=0: no swap, check the original.\n\n- i=1: swap 0 and 1.\n\n- i=2: swap 1 and 2.\n\n- i=3: swap 2 and 3.\n\nWait, no, the code's loop is for i in range(4):\n\nfor each i, the code swaps the i-th and (i-1)-th elements if i >=1. \n\nSo for i=0: no swap.\n\ni=1: swap 0 and 1.\n\ni=2: swap 1 and 2.\n\ni=3: swap 2 and 3.\n\nThus, the four possibilities are the original, and the three swaps (each adjacent pair once). \n\nSo for each of these four cases, we need to check if the resulting string contains 'AGC' as a substring. \n\nThus, for each of the four cases, we can check the three possible positions where 'AGC' could start (positions 0, 1, or 2 in the four-character string). \n\nWait, the four-character string has length 4, so 'AGC' can start at position 0 or 1. \n\nSo for each of the four cases (the four permutations), we need to check if any of the first three characters form 'AGC' (positions 0-2) or 1-3? Wait, no, 'AGC' is three characters, so in a four-character string, it can start at 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the four-character string has indices 0,1,2,3. The substring 'AGC' can start at 0 (indices 0-2) or 1 (indices 1-3). \n\nThus, for each permutation, we can check if any of these two substrings is 'AGC'. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each of the four permutations (original and the three swaps):\n\n    create the string (as a char array of 4 elements).\n\n    check if any of the first three characters (indices 0-2) form 'AGC', or the next three (indices 1-3) form 'AGC'.\n\nWait, no, the substring 'AGC' is three characters. So in a four-character string, the possible starting indices are 0 and 1. \n\nThus, for each permutation:\n\n    check if (chars[0] == 'A' && chars[1] == 'G' && chars[2] == 'C') \n\n    OR \n\n    (chars[1] == 'A' && chars[2] == 'G' && chars[3] == 'C') \n\n    OR \n\n    (chars[0] == 'A' && chars[1] == 'G' && chars[2] == 'C') \n\nWait, the first case is the first three characters, the second case is the last three. \n\nWait, the first three characters (indices 0-2) can form 'AGC', or the last three (indices 1-3) can form 'AGC'. \n\nThus, for each permutation, we can check these two possibilities. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each permutation (four cases):\n\n    create the temp array.\n\n    check if (temp[0] == 'A' && temp[1] == 'G' && temp[2] == 'C') \n\n    || (temp[1] == 'A' && temp[2] == 'G' && temp[3] == 'C') \n\n    if any of these is true, then the permutation contains 'AGC', so the ok function returns false.\n\nThus, the ok function returns false if any of the four permutations has 'AGC' in either of those positions. \n\nSo in the C code, for each character c (A, C, G, T), we need to compute the new_last3 index, then check the four permutations of the four characters (the previous three plus the new character) to see if any of them contains 'AGC' in any of the two possible positions. \n\nThis is a bit involved, but manageable. \n\nNow, the main steps for the first part's code in C:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize the memo array.\n\nCall dfs(0, initial_last3_index).\n\nThe initial_last3 is \"TTT\", which corresponds to the index 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63.\n\nThus, the initial call is dfs(0, 63).\n\nThe result is the count modulo mod.\n\nOnce we have the count, we need to convert it to a string. \n\nThen, process that string with the second part's logic. \n\nThe second part's code in C:\n\nThe second part's code processes a string of characters (the digits of the count) and computes a score based on the rules. \n\nThe code in Python:\n\ns = list(input())\n\nnum_g, num_p = 0,0\n\nscore =0\n\nfor x in s:\n\n    if x == 'g':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            score +=1\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    elif x == 'p':\n\n        if num_g - num_p >0:\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            score -=1\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # ignore other characters?\n\n        pass\n\nprint(score)\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\n- Convert the count to a string (e.g., using sprintf).\n\n- Iterate over each character in the string.\n\n- For each character:\n\n    if it's 'g':\n\n        if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n            score +=1\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    elif it's 'p':\n\n        if (num_g - num_p) >0:\n\n            num_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            score -=1\n\n            num_g +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        // ignore\n\nThus, the C code for the second part would process each character in the string. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the count using the first part's DP.\n\n3. Convert the count to a string.\n\n4. Process the string with the second part's logic.\n\n5. Output the score.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nWe need to implement the dfs function with memoization. \n\nBut in C, recursion might be okay for n up to 80. \n\nAlternatively, we can implement it iteratively, but recursion is easier to code. \n\nThe memo array can be a global array. \n\nThe code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007\n\nint memo[81][64]; // assuming n up to 80.\n\nint toIndex(char *s) {\n\n    int idx =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n\n        switch(s[i]) {\n\n            case 'A': idx = idx*4 +0; break;\n\n            case 'C': idx = idx*4 +1; break;\n\n            case 'G': idx = idx*4 +2; break;\n\n            case 'T': idx = idx*4 +3; break;\n\n            default: // error?\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return idx;\n\n}\n\nint dfs(int cur, int last3_idx) {\n\n    if (cur == n) return 1;\n\n    if (memo[cur][last3_idx] != -1) return memo[cur][last3_idx];\n\n    int ret =0;\n\n    char c_list[4] = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'};\n\n    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n        char c = c_list[i];\n\n        // compute new_last3 index.\n\n        // current last3 is represented by last3_idx.\n\n        // extract the three characters.\n\n        int a = (last3_idx / 16) %4;\n\n        int b = (last3_idx /4) %4;\n\n        int c_val = last3_idx %4;\n\n        // new character's value.\n\n        int new_char_val;\n\n        switch(c) {\n\n            case 'A': new_char_val =0; break;\n\n            case 'C': new_char_val =1; break;\n\n            case 'G': new_char_val =2; break;\n\n            case 'T': new_char_val =3; break;\n\n        }\n\n        // new_last3 is b, c_val, new_char_val.\n\n        int new_last3_idx = (b *16) + (c_val *4) + new_char_val;\n\n        // Now, check if adding this character is allowed.\n\n        // Need to check the four permutations of the four characters.\n\n        // The four characters are a, b, c_val, new_char_val.\n\n        // Convert them to characters.\n\n        char chars[4] = {\n\n            (a ==0 ?

But the second program's code expects 'g's and 'p's. So if the count is, say, 123, then the string is \"123\", and the processing will see '1', '2', '3', which are not 'g' or 'p', so the score remains 0. \n\nBut according to the problem's original setup, this is what is required. \n\nHowever, this may not be the intended behavior, but given the problem's description, this is what the code would do. \n\nThus, this C program should replicate the behavior of the two Python programs in sequence. \n\nNow, let's check for possible errors.\n\nFirst, in the toIndex function: the input s is a 3-character string. The function processes each character, but in C, strings are null-terminated, so passing a 3-character string like \"TTT\" would be okay. \n\nIn the dfs function, the initial last3 is 'TTT', which is index 63. \n\nThe memo array is initialized to -1. \n\nThe count is computed correctly modulo MOD. \n\nThen, the count is converted to a string using sprintf. \n\nThe second part's processing loops over each character in the string. \n\nIf the count is 0, the string is \"0\", which is not 'g' or 'p', so score remains 0. \n\nThus, the code should work as per the given Python programs. \n\nHowever, there's a possible issue with the first part's code: the 'ok' function's implementation. \n\nIn the code above, the four permutations are checked for the presence of 'AGC' in either of the two possible positions (0-2 or 1-3). \n\nWait, the code checks for:\n\nif (temp[0] == 'A' && temp[1] == 'G' && temp[2] == 'C') \n\nOR \n\n(temp[1] == 'A' && temp[2] == 'G' && temp[3] == 'C') \n\nThis covers the two possible starting positions for 'AGC' in the four-character string. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother possible issue is the order of the characters in the four_chars array. \n\nThe four characters are a (first character of last3), b (second), c_val (third), and new_char_val (fourth). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nNow, the final C program is as above. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the memo array is properly initialized. \n\nAlso, the maximum n is up to 80, so the memo array size is okay. \n\nThe count can be up to 1e9+7, so sprintf with a 20-character buffer is sufficient. \n\nThus, the final code should be as written."
