But note: the second program does not know that the string is digits. But in our case, we know it. But to be safe and consistent with the second program, we can use the 256 array. It's acceptable. But the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\". We are not doing I/O in the middle. Let's code accordingly. Steps:\n\n  Read the initial string (without spaces) using scanf. Replace \"BC\" with \"D\": \n      We'll create a new string. We traverse the input string. i=0\n          while (i < len) {\n              if (i+1 < len && input[i]=='B' && input[i+1]=='C') {\n                  new_string[j++] = 'D';\n                  i += 2;\n              } else {\n                  new_string[j++] = input[i];\n                  i++;\n              }\n          }\n      Then null-terminate the new_string. Then traverse the new_string to compute `cnt` and `tmp` as in the first program. Then convert `cnt` to a string. We can use:\n          char num_str[25]; // enough for 64-bit integer: 20 digits\n          sprintf(num_str, \"%ld\", cnt);\n\n  Then, build frequency array for the string `num_str` (for all characters in the string). Then check: \n        int freq[256] = {0};\n        for (int i=0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n            freq[(unsigned char)num_str[i]]++;\n        }\n        int distinct = 0;\n        int valid = 1;\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n            if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                distinct++;\n                if (freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                    valid = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (distinct == 2 && valid) {\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n        }\n\nBut note: what about the null terminator? The string `num_str` is null-terminated, but we traverse until the null, so we skip the null. Let's write the entire C program. Edge: if the input string is empty? Then after replacement, the new_string is empty -> cnt=0 -> num_str is \"0\". Then frequency: \n        '0' appears once -> distinct=1 -> output \"No\". This matches: \n  First program: for an empty string, it would output 0. Second program: for \"0\", it would have distinct=1 and frequency of '0'=1 -> \"No\". Another edge: the input string is \"BC\" -> becomes \"D\". Then: \n      i=0: 'D' -> cnt += tmp? But note: tmp is 0 at the beginning. So cnt=0? But wait: \n          The program: \n            tmp=0\n            i=0: character is 'D' -> then we do: cnt += tmp -> 0. So output 0. Then the second program gets \"0\" -> \"No\". But what if the input is \"ABC\": \n  Replace: \"ABC\" -> becomes \"AD\"?",

Actually: \n            Original: \"AAABCBC\"\n            Step: We see \"AAA\" -> then at index3: 'B' and next is 'C' -> replace by 'D' -> now we have \"AAAD\" and then the next is 'B' at index4? But we skipped the 'C', so we are at index5? Actually, we replaced the first \"BC\" at index3 and 4, then we continue from index5? Then at index5: we have 'B' and then at index6 is 'C' -> so we replace that too. So the string becomes \"AAADD\". Then traverse: \n            'A' at 0 -> tmp=1\n            'A' at 1 -> tmp=2\n            'A' at 2 -> tmp=3\n            'D' at 3 -> cnt += 3 -> cnt=3\n            'D' at 4 -> cnt += 3? -> because tmp is still 3? But note: after the first 'D', we don't reset. Only when we encounter a character that is not 'A' and not 'D'? The condition: \n                    if (c=='A') -> tmp++.\n                    else if (c=='D') -> cnt += tmp.\n                    else -> reset tmp to 0. So at the second 'D': we do cnt += 3 again -> cnt=6. So output 6 -> string \"6\" -> distinct one -> \"No\". But what if the input is \"AAAA\"? No \"BC\", so no replacement -> becomes \"AAAA\". Then traverse: \n        four 'A's -> tmp becomes 4? Then we don't have any 'D', so we never add to cnt? Then cnt=0. Then second program: \"0\" -> \"No\". But note: the first program counts only when we have a 'D' (which is a replaced \"BC\") and then we add the current consecutive A's. So we are consistent. Now, we code accordingly. We assume the input string is not too long (as per the problem constraints). Steps in C:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read input string\n      char input[100001]; // assuming max 100000 characters\n      scanf(\"%s\", input);\n\n      // Step 2: Replace \"BC\" with \"D\"\n      char *replaced = (char *)malloc(100001 * sizeof(char)); // same length or less\n      int j = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; input[i]; ) {\n          if (input[i] == 'B' && input[i+1] == 'C') {\n              replaced[j++] = 'D'; i += 2;\n          } else {\n              replaced[j++] = input[i];\n              i++;\n          }\n      }\n      replaced[j] = '\\0';\n\n      // Step 3: Compute cnt\n      long cnt = 0;\n      long tmp = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; replaced[i]; i++) { if (replaced[i] == 'A') {\n              tmp++;\n          } else if (replaced[i] == 'D') {\n              cnt += tmp;\n          } else {\n              tmp = 0;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 4: Convert cnt to a string\n      char num_str[25]; // enough for 20 digits\n      sprintf(num_str, \"%ld\", cnt);\n\n      // Step 5: Build frequency array for the string num_str\n      int freq[256] = {0};\n      for (int i = 0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n          unsigned char c = num_str[i];\n          freq[c]++;\n      }\n\n      int distinct = 0;\n      int valid = 1;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] > 0) {\n              distinct++;\n              if (freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                  valid = 0;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (distinct == 2 && valid) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      free(replaced);\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: what if the number is 0? Then the string is \"0\", which is one character. Then distinct=1 and valid=0? Actually, the frequency of '0' is 1 -> so valid=0. Then we output \"No\". Correct. But what if the number is 22? Then the string is \"22\": \n        distinct=1 (only '2') -> and valid=0 because the frequency of '2' is 2? Actually, we set valid=0 only when freq[i]!=2. Here, freq['2']=2 -> so valid remains 1? But then we break the loop? No, we set valid=0 if we find one that is not 2. However, we set valid=1 initially. Then we iterate: \n            for each i in 0..255: \n                if freq[i]>0: distinct++ (so distinct becomes 1)\n                    check: if freq[i]!=2 -> then set valid=0? But 2==2 -> so valid remains 1. Then we check: distinct==2 -> false -> so we output \"No\". But 22: \n            distinct=1 -> so condition fails. So we output \"No\", which is correct because we need two distinct characters. What if the number is 1122? The string \"1122\": \n            distinct = 2 (for '1' and '2') \n            and for '1': freq=2 -> valid remains 1 (until we see a non-2? but then we see '2' also 2) -> valid=1. Then we output \"Yes\". But note: the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters and each appears twice. But what about the order of the frequency array? We iterate over the entire 256, so we will see both '1' and '2'. So the program is correct.",

The worst-case cnt is (n/2)*(n/2) which is 10^10 -> so we need long long for cnt. But tmp is the consecutive A's, which at most n (200000) so int is enough? But we are adding to cnt which is long long. So we can leave tmp as int? But the first program uses `long` for both. So we use `long long` for both to be safe. But note: the consecutive A's can be up to 200000, so `long long` for tmp is overkill? But it's safe. So:\n\n  long long cnt = 0;\n  long long tmp = 0; Then in the loop: \n        if (replaced[i]=='A') tmp++;\n        else if (replaced[i]=='D') cnt += tmp; // then we leave tmp unchanged? \n        else tmp = 0;\n\nBut note: after a 'D', we don't reset tmp. The consecutive A's can continue? Example: \"AAD\" -> \n        first A: tmp=1\n        second A: tmp=2\n        then D: cnt +=2 -> now cnt=2, and tmp remains 2? Then if we have more A's? \n          \"AADA\": \n            After the D: then we get an 'A' -> tmp becomes 3? Then if we have a D later, we add 3. So the consecutive A's can span multiple segments? Example: \"AADAAAD\" -> \n        Segment1: \"AA\" -> then D: cnt=2, then we have \"AAA\" and then D: then we add 3 -> total=5. This is intended. Therefore, we do not reset tmp on 'D'.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n  - Reads a string and replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n  - Then counts the number of valid sequences: \n        It traverses the string, keeping a running count `tmp` of consecutive 'A's. \n        When it encounters a 'D' (which was originally \"BC\"), it adds `tmp` to the total count `cnt`.\n        If it encounters any other character (especially 'B' or 'C' that are not part of \"BC\"), it resets `tmp` to 0.\n  - Outputs the total count.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC132_A):\n  - Reads a string and checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly two times.\n  - If so, prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nHowever, note that the second program uses the output of the first program? \nBut looking at the problem, we are to chain the programs: the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs a number (a long) and the second program expects a string of 4 characters? \nThis mismatch indicates that the chain might be intended differently.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nIn the first program, the output is a number (e.g., 3). The second program expects a string. \nBut the second program's input example is a string of 4 characters (like \"ASDF\")? \n\nThis seems problematic. However, note the example in the second program: it checks for two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nBut the output of the first program is a single integer. How can that be the input to the second program?\n\nWe must reconsider: the problem states that the entire sequence of programs is to be translated into one C program that behaves identically.\n\nBut the two programs are independent? Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input (to the first program) -> First program's output -> becomes the input of the second program.\n\nBut the first program's output is a number (e.g., 3) and the second program expects a string? \n\nLooking at the second program: it reads a string. So if the first program outputs \"3\", then the second program would read the string \"3\". \nBut then the second program would check: \n   map: \n        '3' -> 1 (only one character, so map.size()=1, and the count is 1, not 2) -> outputs \"No\".\n\nThis does not make sense in a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the first program's output is a string? \nBut the first program outputs a long integer via `out.println(cnt)`. \n\nSo we have two possibilities:\n  1. The chain is: first program takes a string and outputs a number. Then the second program should take that number (as a string) and process it.\n  2. The problem has a mistake? Or the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way? \n\nBut the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd we are to run the entire sequence: meaning the input to the chain is the input to the first program, and the output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\nSo the input to the chain is the string that the first program reads.\n\nThe first program outputs a number (as a string of digits) and that becomes the input to the second program.\n\nThe second program then checks if that number (as a string) has exactly two distinct digits, each appearing exactly two times.\n\nExample:\n  Input to first: \"ABCBC\" -> becomes \"AD\" (replace \"BC\" by \"D\")\n      Then: \n        i=0: 'A' -> tmp=1\n        i=1: 'D' -> cnt += 1 -> cnt=1\n        So output is 1.\n\n  Then the second program gets the string \"1\" (which is the output of the first program).\n      It has one distinct character and one occurrence -> outputs \"No\".\n\nBut note: the first program is from a contest (AGC034) and the second from another (ABC132). They are independent problems? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". \n\nSo we must chain them as described.\n\nTherefore, the plan for the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial input string (from stdin) and process it as the first program does.\n          - Replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n          - Traverse the string, counting the valid sequences to get a long integer `cnt`.\n\n  Step 2: Convert the long integer `cnt` to a string (because the second program expects a string input).\n\n  Step 3: Process that string as the second program does:\n          - Check that the string has exactly 2 distinct characters, and each character appears exactly 2 times.\n\n  Step 4: Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nHowever, note the second program condition: \n    if (ok && map.size() == 2) \n\nBut what if the string has more than 2 distinct characters? Then map.size() would be more than 2 and we output \"No\".\n\nBut note: the second program also breaks if any character does not appear exactly 2 times.\n\nAlso, the second program does not require the string to be of length 4? It can be of any length? \nBut the condition: \n    each character appears twice and there are exactly two distinct characters -> then the string must be of length 4.\n\nHowever, the first program outputs a number which can have more than 4 digits? \nFor example, if the first program outputs 1122, then the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters? \nActually, it has two distinct characters: '1' and '2'. And each appears twice? \nBut wait: \n    '1' appears twice? Actually, in \"1122\": \n        '1': count=2, '2': count=2 -> then it would output \"Yes\".\n\nBut what if the first program outputs 12? Then the string \"12\" has two distinct characters, but each appears only once -> then output \"No\".\n\nWhat if the first program outputs 1111? Then distinct characters: only '1', so map.size()=1 -> \"No\".\n\nSo the second program's condition is: \n    The string must have exactly two distinct characters, and each must appear exactly twice.\n\nNow, note that the first program outputs the number without any extra formatting (just the digits). \n\nBut what if the number is negative? The problem states that `cnt` is a long and we only add non-negative numbers, so it should be non-negative.\n\nSo the C program structure:\n\n  1. Read a string (the initial input) from stdin.\n  2. Process the string to replace every occurrence of \"BC\" by \"D\". We must do this safely: note that the replacement should not be overlapping? \n        Example: \"BCC\" -> replace the first \"BC\" (if we consider overlapping?) but note: the string \"BCC\" does not have \"BC\" at the first two? \n        Actually: \n            s = \"BCC\": \n                The first two are \"BC\" -> replace by \"D\", then we have \"D\" and the next character is 'C'. So the string becomes \"DC\".\n        The Java replaceAll replaces non-overlapping occurrences from left to right.\n\n  3. Then traverse the replaced string to compute `cnt` (a long integer).\n\n  4. Convert `cnt` to a string. We need to be cautious because `cnt` can be zero? and it can be large.\n\n  5. Then, for the second part, we take the string representation of `cnt` and:\n        - Count the frequency of each character.\n        - Check if the map has exactly 2 distinct characters and each has frequency 2.\n\n  6. Print \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHowever, note: the second program in Java uses `in.next()`, which reads the next token. The token is the entire string of the number? \nBut in the first program, we output the number as a single line. So the second program reads the entire line? \n\nBut in the second Java program, `in.next()` reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). \nSince the first program outputs the number and then a newline, the second program's `in.next()` would read the number without the newline? \nBut the number is the only token on that line.\n\nSo in C, we can convert the number to a string and then process that string.\n\nBut note: the second program does not read beyond the token. So if we have the string representation of the number (without any extra spaces) then we are safe.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial string. We assume it has no spaces? Because the first Java program uses `in.next()`. \n          So in C, we can read a token (using scanf) or read a whole line? The problem does not specify. \n          But the first program uses `in.next()` which reads until whitespace. So we'll read a single token.\n\n  Step 2: Replace \"BC\" by \"D\". We need to do this in a way that avoids overlapping. We can traverse the string and when we see 'B' followed by 'C', we replace and then skip the next character? \n\n          Alternatively, we can build a new string. Since the input string can be long, we should do it efficiently.\n\n          We'll create a new string for the replaced version. Traverse the original string:\n            - If the current character is 'B' and the next is 'C', then we put 'D' and skip the next character (i.e., i++ to skip the 'C').\n            - Otherwise, we put the current character.\n\n          But note: what if the string ends with 'B'? Then we just put 'B'.\n\n  Step 3: Compute `cnt` as described.\n\n  Step 4: Convert the long integer `cnt` to a string. We can use `sprintf` or write our own. But note: `cnt` can be 0.\n\n  Step 5: Build a frequency map for the string representation. We can use an array of 256 (for ASCII) or a fixed size since digits are 0-9 and possibly negative? \n          But note: `cnt` is non-negative. So we have digits only.\n\n          However, the number can have any digit from '0' to '9'. We can use an array of 10 integers? But wait, what if the number has a digit that is not in 0-9? \n          Actually, it's a decimal representation.\n\n          But note: the second program uses a HashMap for any character. So we must account for any character? However, our string is composed only of digits.\n\n          So we can use an array for the 10 digits? But what if the number has a minus sign? We said it's non-negative. So no minus.\n\n          Therefore, we can use an array `freq[10]` for digits '0' to '9'. But note: the second program counts distinct characters. \n          So we are only concerned with the characters that appear. However, we can also use a more general method: an array of 256.\n\n          Alternatively, since we know the string is composed of digits, we can do:\n\n            int freq[10] = {0};\n            for each char c in the string:\n                if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') \n                    index = c - '0';\n                    freq[index]++;\n\n          But the second program does not assume digits. So we must count distinct characters? The string is a sequence of digits, but the distinct characters are the distinct digits.\n\n          However, the condition: the string must have exactly two distinct digits and each appears twice. But note: the total length must be 4? \n\n          Actually, the condition does not require the string to be of length 4? It only requires each of the two distinct characters to appear twice. \n          So the total length is 4. But what if the number has more than 4 digits? Then the condition fails because there will be more than 4 characters? \n          Or if it has less than 4, then also fails.\n\n          However, the second program does not check the length. It only checks the frequency and the number of distinct characters. \n          So if the number has 5 digits, then one digit must appear more than twice? Then condition fails.\n\n          Actually, the condition: \n            for each character: must appear exactly 2 times -> so the entire string must be of length 4? \n            and two distinct characters -> then the string must be of length 4.\n\n          Therefore, we can also check the length: if the length is not 4, then output \"No\". \n          But the second program doesn't check the length. It only checks the frequency and the distinct count.\n\n          However, if the string length is not 4, then it is impossible to have two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice? \n          Because the sum of frequencies would be 4.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            if (strlen(s) != 4) -> then condition fails.\n\n          But the second program doesn't check the length, so it would still iterate and set `ok=false` as soon as it finds a frequency that is not 2.\n\n          We can do without the length check.\n\n  Step 6: Print \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut note: the second program also requires that the map has size 2. So if the string has two distinct characters and each appears twice, then we print \"Yes\". \n          Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nExample: \n   \"1122\": distinct characters: '1' and '2'. Each appears twice -> \"Yes\".\n   \"1111\": distinct characters: only '1' -> map.size()=1 -> \"No\".\n\nImplementation for frequency:\n\n  We'll use an array `freq` of size 256 (for all ASCII) initialized to 0.\n\n  Steps for the string `s` (which is the string representation of `cnt`):\n      int freq[256] = {0};\n      int distinct = 0;\n      int i;\n      for (i = 0; s[i]; i++) {\n          freq[(int)s[i]]++;\n      }\n\n      Then we check:\n          int valid = 1;\n          int countDistinct = 0;\n          for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n              if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                  countDistinct++;\n                  if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                      valid = 0;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (valid && countDistinct == 2) {\n              printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"No\\n\");\n          }\n\nHowever, note: the second program breaks at the first character that does not have frequency 2. \nBut our method is the same: we check every character and if any frequency is not 2, we set valid=0.\n\nBut we can break early? It's not necessary because the string is short (the number might be large, but the number of distinct characters is at most 10, and the string length is the number of digits, which can be up to 20? but 256 is fixed).\n\nAlternatively, we can break out of the frequency building? Actually, we must build the entire frequency table to check distinct count.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n      We traverse the string and count frequency.\n      Then traverse the frequency table to check two conditions: distinct count must be 2 and every frequency must be 2.\n\nBut note: the second program does not build a frequency table for all 256, but only for the characters that appear. \nWe are doing the same: we traverse the entire 256 array, but we skip zeros. \n\nAlternatively, we can only check the digits that appeared? We know the string is digits. So we can do:\n\n      int freq[10] = {0};   // for digits '0'..'9'\n      for (i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n          if (s[i] < '0' || s[i] > '9') {\n              // This should not happen, but if it does, we break?\n              // Since the number is nonnegative, we don't expect non-digit.\n          }\n          freq[s[i]-'0']++;\n      }\n\n      Then we count distinct digits that have non-zero frequency and check that each non-zero frequency is 2? \n      But note: we must check every digit that appears? \n\n      Then:\n          int distinct = 0;\n          int valid = 1;\n          for (int d=0; d<10; d++) {\n              if (freq[d] > 0) {\n                  distinct++;\n                  if (freq[d] != 2) {\n                      valid = 0;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          if (distinct == 2 && valid) {\n              printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"No\\n\");\n          }\n\nBut note: what if there is a digit that does not appear? We skip it.\n\nHowever, the second program would have considered the distinct characters. In this case, the distinct characters are the digits that appear.\n\nBut note: the second program does not know that the string is digits. But in our case, we know it. \n\nBut to be safe and consistent with the second program, we can use the 256 array. It's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\". We are not doing I/O in the middle.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Read the initial string (without spaces) using scanf.\n\n  Replace \"BC\" with \"D\": \n      We'll create a new string. We traverse the input string. \n          i=0\n          while (i < len) {\n              if (i+1 < len && input[i]=='B' && input[i+1]=='C') {\n                  new_string[j++] = 'D';\n                  i += 2;\n              } else {\n                  new_string[j++] = input[i];\n                  i++;\n              }\n          }\n      Then null-terminate the new_string.\n\n  Then traverse the new_string to compute `cnt` and `tmp` as in the first program.\n\n  Then convert `cnt` to a string. We can use:\n          char num_str[25]; // enough for 64-bit integer: 20 digits\n          sprintf(num_str, \"%ld\", cnt);\n\n  Then, build frequency array for the string `num_str` (for all characters in the string).\n\n  Then check: \n        int freq[256] = {0};\n        for (int i=0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n            freq[(unsigned char)num_str[i]]++;\n        }\n        int distinct = 0;\n        int valid = 1;\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n            if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                distinct++;\n                if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                    valid = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (distinct == 2 && valid) {\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n        }\n\nBut note: what about the null terminator? The string `num_str` is null-terminated, but we traverse until the null, so we skip the null.\n\nLet's write the entire C program.\n\nEdge: if the input string is empty? \n  Then after replacement, the new_string is empty -> cnt=0 -> num_str is \"0\".\n  Then frequency: \n        '0' appears once -> distinct=1 -> output \"No\".\n\nThis matches: \n  First program: for an empty string, it would output 0.\n  Second program: for \"0\", it would have distinct=1 and frequency of '0'=1 -> \"No\".\n\nAnother edge: the input string is \"BC\" -> becomes \"D\". \n  Then: \n      i=0: 'D' -> cnt += tmp? But note: tmp is 0 at the beginning. \n      So cnt=0? \n      But wait: \n          The program: \n            tmp=0\n            i=0: character is 'D' -> then we do: cnt += tmp -> 0.\n          So output 0.\n\n  Then the second program gets \"0\" -> \"No\".\n\nBut what if the input is \"ABC\": \n  Replace: \"ABC\" -> becomes \"AD\"? \n      Actually: \n          The string \"ABC\": \n              We look for \"BC\": at index1 and 2? \n              So we replace the \"BC\" at the end? \n          Steps: \n              i=0: 'A' -> not replaced -> new_string[0]='A'\n              i=1: 'B' and next is 'C'? -> so we replace and skip the 'C'. \n              So new_string = \"AD\".\n\n          Then traverse:\n              i0: 'A' -> tmp=1\n              i1: 'D' -> cnt += 1 -> cnt=1.\n\n          Then output 1 -> string \"1\".\n\n          Then second program: \n              distinct characters: '1' -> one distinct character -> \"No\".\n\nBut what if the input is \"AABC\":\n  Replace: \"AABC\" -> becomes \"AAD\".\n  Then: \n        i0: 'A' -> tmp=1\n        i1: 'A' -> tmp=2\n        i2: 'D' -> cnt += 2 -> cnt=2.\n\n        Then string \"2\" -> distinct one -> \"No\".\n\nBut what if the input is \"AAABCBC\":\n  Replace: \n        \"AAA\" -> then \"BC\" at position 3,4 -> becomes 'D'; then \"BC\" at 5,6 -> becomes 'D'. \n        So \"AAAD\" -> then at the next part: we have the rest \"BC\" becomes 'D'? Actually, we do the replacement in one pass? \n        The replacement in the first program: `s.replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\")` replaces every non-overlapping occurrence. \n        So \"AAABCBC\" becomes \"AAAD\" then the next two are \"BC\" -> becomes \"AAADD\"? \n        Actually: \n            Original: \"AAABCBC\"\n            Step: \n                We see \"AAA\" -> then at index3: 'B' and next is 'C' -> replace by 'D' -> now we have \"AAAD\" and then the next is 'B' at index4? \n                But we skipped the 'C', so we are at index5? Actually, we replaced the first \"BC\" at index3 and 4, then we continue from index5? \n                Then at index5: we have 'B' and then at index6 is 'C' -> so we replace that too. \n                So the string becomes \"AAADD\".\n\n        Then traverse: \n            'A' at 0 -> tmp=1\n            'A' at 1 -> tmp=2\n            'A' at 2 -> tmp=3\n            'D' at 3 -> cnt += 3 -> cnt=3\n            'D' at 4 -> cnt += 3? -> because tmp is still 3? \n                But note: after the first 'D', we don't reset. Only when we encounter a character that is not 'A' and not 'D'? \n                The condition: \n                    if (c=='A') -> tmp++.\n                    else if (c=='D') -> cnt += tmp.\n                    else -> reset tmp to 0.\n\n            So at the second 'D': we do cnt += 3 again -> cnt=6.\n\n        So output 6 -> string \"6\" -> distinct one -> \"No\".\n\nBut what if the input is \"AAAA\"? \n  No \"BC\", so no replacement -> becomes \"AAAA\".\n  Then traverse: \n        four 'A's -> tmp becomes 4? \n        Then we don't have any 'D', so we never add to cnt? \n        Then cnt=0.\n\n        Then second program: \"0\" -> \"No\".\n\nBut note: the first program counts only when we have a 'D' (which is a replaced \"BC\") and then we add the current consecutive A's.\n\nSo we are consistent.\n\nNow, we code accordingly.\n\nWe assume the input string is not too long (as per the problem constraints).\n\nSteps in C:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read input string\n      char input[100001]; // assuming max 100000 characters\n      scanf(\"%s\", input);\n\n      // Step 2: Replace \"BC\" with \"D\"\n      char *replaced = (char *)malloc(100001 * sizeof(char)); // same length or less\n      int j = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; input[i]; ) {\n          if (input[i] == 'B' && input[i+1] == 'C') {\n              replaced[j++] = 'D';\n              i += 2;\n          } else {\n              replaced[j++] = input[i];\n              i++;\n          }\n      }\n      replaced[j] = '\\0';\n\n      // Step 3: Compute cnt\n      long cnt = 0;\n      long tmp = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; replaced[i]; i++) {\n          if (replaced[i] == 'A') {\n              tmp++;\n          } else if (replaced[i] == 'D') {\n              cnt += tmp;\n          } else {\n              tmp = 0;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Step 4: Convert cnt to a string\n      char num_str[25]; // enough for 20 digits\n      sprintf(num_str, \"%ld\", cnt);\n\n      // Step 5: Build frequency array for the string num_str\n      int freq[256] = {0};\n      for (int i = 0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n          unsigned char c = num_str[i];\n          freq[c]++;\n      }\n\n      int distinct = 0;\n      int valid = 1;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] > 0) {\n              distinct++;\n              if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                  valid = 0;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (distinct == 2 && valid) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      free(replaced);\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: what if the number is 0? Then the string is \"0\", which is one character. \n  Then distinct=1 and valid=0? Actually, the frequency of '0' is 1 -> so valid=0. Then we output \"No\". Correct.\n\nBut what if the number is 22? \n  Then the string is \"22\": \n        distinct=1 (only '2') -> and valid=0 because the frequency of '2' is 2? \n        Actually, we set valid=0 only when freq[i]!=2. Here, freq['2']=2 -> so valid remains 1? \n        But then we break the loop? No, we set valid=0 if we find one that is not 2. \n\n        However, we set valid=1 initially. Then we iterate: \n            for each i in 0..255: \n                if freq[i]>0: \n                    distinct++ (so distinct becomes 1)\n                    check: if freq[i]!=2 -> then set valid=0? \n                    But 2==2 -> so valid remains 1.\n\n        Then we check: distinct==2 -> false -> so we output \"No\".\n\n        But 22: \n            distinct=1 -> so condition fails.\n\n        So we output \"No\", which is correct because we need two distinct characters.\n\nWhat if the number is 1122? \n        The string \"1122\": \n            distinct = 2 (for '1' and '2') \n            and for '1': freq=2 -> valid remains 1 (until we see a non-2? but then we see '2' also 2) -> valid=1.\n            Then we output \"Yes\".\n\nBut note: the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\nBut what about the order of the frequency array? We iterate over the entire 256, so we will see both '1' and '2'.\n\nSo the program is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the first program uses `long` for `cnt`. In C, we use `long` as well. But note the format: `%ld` for printing and for the conversion.\n\nBut what if the system has different sizes? The problem doesn't specify. But we assume the same as Java: 64-bit long.\n\nBut in C, `long` can be 32-bit on Windows? We should use `long long` to be safe for 64-bit? \n\nBut the problem: the first Java program uses `long` which is 64-bit. In C, we can use `long long` and `%lld`.\n\nBut the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must match the Java `long` which is 64-bit.\n\nIn C, on most online judges, `long` is 64-bit? But to be safe, we use `long long` and `%lld`.\n\nSo:\n\n      long long cnt = 0;\n      ...\n      sprintf(num_str, \"%lld\", cnt);\n\nAlternatively, we can use `long` and `%ld` and hope that `long` is 64-bit? \n\nBut the constraints: the input string can be up to 200000 characters? \n  The maximum `cnt` can be: \n        In the worst-case: the replaced string is \"AAAAA...A\" (n/2 times) and then followed by n/2 times 'D'. \n        Then tmp = n/2, and then we add tmp for each 'D'. \n        So cnt = (n/2) * (n/2) = n^2/4. \n        If n=200000, then n^2/4 = 10^10, which fits in 32-bit long? \n        10^10 is 10,000,000,000 -> 34 bits. So we need 64-bit.\n\nTherefore, we must use 64-bit integers.\n\nLet's change to `long long`:\n\n  long long cnt = 0;\n  long long tmp = 0;   // because tmp can be up to n (which is 200000) but we use long long for consistency? Actually, tmp is at most n, which is 200000, so int is enough. But to avoid overflow: cnt += tmp (which can be 200000) and we do that for many D's? The worst-case cnt is (n/2)*(n/2) which is 10^10 -> so we need long long for cnt. But tmp is the consecutive A's, which at most n (200000) so int is enough? But we are adding to cnt which is long long. So we can leave tmp as int? \n\n  But the first program uses `long` for both. So we use `long long` for both to be safe.\n\nBut note: the consecutive A's can be up to 200000, so `long long` for tmp is overkill? But it's safe.\n\nSo:\n\n  long long cnt = 0;\n  long long tmp = 0;\n\n  Then in the loop: \n        if (replaced[i]=='A') tmp++;\n        else if (replaced[i]=='D') cnt += tmp;   // then we leave tmp unchanged? \n        else tmp = 0;\n\nBut note: after a 'D', we don't reset tmp. The consecutive A's can continue? \n  Example: \"AAD\" -> \n        first A: tmp=1\n        second A: tmp=2\n        then D: cnt +=2 -> now cnt=2, and tmp remains 2? \n        Then if we have more A's? \n          \"AADA\": \n            After the D: then we get an 'A' -> tmp becomes 3? \n            Then if we have a D later, we add 3.\n\n  So the consecutive A's can span multiple segments? \n\n  Example: \"AADAAAD\" -> \n        Segment1: \"AA\" -> then D: cnt=2, then we have \"AAA\" and then D: then we add 3 -> total=5.\n\n  This is intended.\n\nTherefore, we do not reset tmp on 'D'. Only reset on non-'A' and non-'D'? \n\nBut note: the replaced string only contains 'A', 'D', and the original characters that are not part of \"BC\" and not 'A'? \n  The original characters: \n        The replacement replaces \"BC\" to 'D'. \n        So the remaining characters are the original characters that are not replaced. \n        What are they? \n            They could be 'B' (if not followed by 'C')? \n            They could be 'C' (if not preceded by 'B')? \n            And other characters? The problem says the input string consists of only 'A','B','C'. \n\n  So the replaced string can contain: \n        'A', 'D', and also 'B' and 'C' that are not part of a \"BC\" (so a standalone 'B' or 'C').\n\n  Therefore, we must reset on 'B' and 'C'. \n\nBut note: the first program: \n        else if (s.charAt(i) == 'D') ... \n        else ...   // which catches 'B' and 'C' and any other? \n\n  So in the replaced string, we have only 'A', 'D', 'B', 'C'. \n\n  But we reset on any character that is not 'A' and not 'D'. So that includes 'B' and 'C'.\n\nTherefore, we reset on 'B' and 'C'. \n\nIn our C code, we do:\n\n      if (replaced[i]=='A') -> tmp++\n      else if (replaced[i]=='D') -> cnt += tmp\n      else -> tmp=0\n\nThis matches.\n\nNow, we write the code accordingly.\n\nWe must free the allocated memory.\n\nBut note: the input string can be large (100000) so we allocate 100001 for the replaced string. \n\nWe assume the replaced string is not longer than the original? Actually, it's shorter: because every replacement of two characters to one. So we are safe.\n\nFinal code:"
