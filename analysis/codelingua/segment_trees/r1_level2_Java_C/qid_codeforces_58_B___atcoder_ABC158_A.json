Actually: \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\") Then the second program reads the first token: \"10\", which is the string \"10\". It checks: does \"10\" contain 'A'? no. 'B'? no. So outputs \"No\".\n\n  Example: if n=65? Then the first program outputs \"65 \\n\" and then ... (divisors: 65, then 5, then 1). The first token is \"65\". The string \"65\" does not contain 'A' or 'B'. So output \"No\".\n\n  Example: n=10 and then the second program reads the entire input? But it doesn't. Therefore, the above C program is correct. But note: what if the integer is negative? The original first program reads an integer. The problem does not specify, but the divisor program assumes positive? The original first program: it iterates from n-1 down to 1. So n should be at least 1? The problem does not specify, but we can assume n>=1.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_58_B):\n  - Reads an integer `n`.\n  - Prints `n` and then a space.\n  - Then it sets `m = n` and iterates from `n-1` down to 1.\n  - For each `i`, if `m` is divisible by `i`, it prints `i` and a space, and sets `m = i`.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n  - Reads a string `s`.\n  - If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', it prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nHowever, note that the first program outputs a sequence of numbers (with spaces) and then the second program expects a string.\n\nBut the chain is: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\nExample:\n  Input to first program: 10\n  Output of first program: \"10 5 1 \" (without quotes, but note the spaces and the trailing space)\n\n  Then the second program reads a string. It will read the entire string \"10 5 1\" (but note the trailing space) and then check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it doesn't, it outputs \"No\".\n\nHowever, note that the second program in the provided code actually reads a single token? But let's look:\n\n  In the second program: `String s = in.next();` \n  The `next()` method of Scanner reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). So it would only read the first token? \n\nBut wait: the output of the first program is a sequence of numbers with spaces. For example, if the first program outputs \"10 5 1 \", then the second program's `in.next()` would read the first token \"10\", and then the rest of the tokens would be \"5\", \"1\", but the second program only reads one token.\n\nThis is a problem because the second program is only reading one token. However, the problem states that the entire output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, the second program should read the entire line? But note: the first program does not output a newline? It uses `System.out.println` for the first number and then `System.out.println` for each subsequent number. So the output is:\n\n  n + \" \\n\"\n  then for each found i: i + \" \\n\"\n\nSo the output is multiple lines.\n\nBut the second program uses `in.next()`, which reads tokens. It will read the first token (which is the first number as a string). The rest of the tokens are not read.\n\nThis does not match the intended chain? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output (including newlines) of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nBut the second program only reads the first token. So we have to consider what the second program actually does: it reads the first token (which is the string of the first number) and then ignores the rest.\n\nTherefore, the chain for an input of 10 would be:\n\n  First program: outputs \"10\\n5\\n1\\n\" (because each println adds a newline)\n  Second program: reads the first token from that, which is \"10\", and then checks if \"10\" contains both 'A' and 'B'. It does not, so outputs \"No\".\n\nBut note: the first program actually outputs:\n  First: println(n + \" \") -> that is: (n) and then a space and then a newline? Actually, no: \n  The first print is: `System.out.println(n + \" \");` -> that is, if n=10, it prints \"10 \" and then a newline.\n  Then in the loop: `System.out.println(i + \" \");` -> each time it prints the number, a space, and a newline.\n\nSo the output is:\n  \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\"\n\nNow, when the second program reads with `in.next()`, it will read the first token, which is \"10\" (because the space and newline are delimiters). So the string s is \"10\".\n\nWe must replicate the same behavior in C.\n\nBut note: the first program does output multiple numbers, each on a new line? Actually, each output is a number followed by a space and then a newline.\n\nHowever, the second program only reads the first token. So we don't need to process the entire output of the first program for the second program? We only need the first token.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program without intermediate I/O. So we have to simulate the chain without actually writing the entire string of the first program and then reading it.\n\nInstead, we can note:\n\n  The first program:\n    - Reads an integer n.\n    - Then it produces a sequence of integers: starting with n, then each divisor in descending order until 1.\n\n  The second program:\n    - Takes the first token (which is the string representation of n) and then checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain can be simplified:\n\n  Step 1: Read integer n (from standard input).\n  Step 2: The first token that the second program would read is the string representation of n.\n\n  So we don't need to generate the entire output of the first program. We only need the first token, which is the original n.\n\n  Then the second program checks: does the string of n contain both 'A' and 'B'? \n\nBut note: what if the first program outputs more than one token? The second program only reads the first. So we don't care about the rest.\n\nTherefore, we can write a C program that:\n\n  - Reads an integer n (like the first program).\n  - Then, we take the string representation of n and check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. (like the second program).\n\nHowever, wait: the first program also produces more tokens? But the second program only uses the first. So we can ignore the rest of the output of the first program.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain would output the entire sequence from the first program and then the second program's output. But in the chain, the second program's output is the final output? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\nThe original chain:\n\n  Program1: outputs a sequence of numbers (each number, a space, and then a newline) and terminates.\n  Then Program2: runs and reads the first token from the input (which is the output of Program1) and then outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut the combined program should not output the intermediate numbers? Because the problem says:\n\n  \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we are not supposed to output the intermediate numbers? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo the intermediate steps (which are the first program's output) should not be printed. Instead, we process the data in memory.\n\nTherefore, the combined program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the integer n (from stdin).\n  Step 2: We do not output the sequence of divisors (because that would be intermediate I/O). Instead, we only need the first token for the next step? But the next step only uses the first token (which is the string of n) and ignores the rest.\n\n  So we can skip generating the entire divisor sequence? Because the second program doesn't use it.\n\n  However, note: the first program does output the entire divisor sequence. But the problem says we should avoid intermediate I/O. So we are allowed to skip generating the string of the entire sequence if the next program doesn't use it.\n\n  Therefore, we only need the string representation of the initial integer n for the second program.\n\n  Then the second program checks: if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', then we output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's output had multiple tokens and the second program only reads the first? Then we don't need the rest.\n\nSo the combined program:\n\n  - Reads an integer n.\n  - Converts n to a string.\n  - Checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n  - Then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut note: the first program also has a side effect: it outputs the divisor sequence. But the problem says that we must avoid intermediate I/O. So we are not allowed to output the divisor sequence? \n\nThe problem states: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we must not output the divisor sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final program should not output the divisor sequence at all. Only the final output (\"Yes\" or \"No\") should be printed.\n\nBut wait: the original chain does output the divisor sequence? And then the second program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the total output of the chain is the divisor sequence and then \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that we are only allowed to output at the very end. So we cannot output the divisor sequence? \n\nThis leads to a contradiction? \n\nLet me re-read: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\".\n\nSo the entire chain must be done without any output until the last step. Therefore, the intermediate output (the divisor sequence) must not be printed.\n\nBut then the second program would not have the input that it expects? \n\nHowever, note that the second program only uses the first token. And the first token is the original integer n. So we can simulate that without printing the entire divisor sequence.\n\nTherefore, the combined program:\n\n  - Reads the integer n (from stdin).\n  - Then, for the second program, we only need the string of n (which we can get without printing the divisor sequence).\n\n  Then we output the result of the second program: \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut what about the rest of the divisor sequence? The second program doesn't read it, so we can ignore it.\n\nSo the program is:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      // Now, we need the string representation of n.\n      char s[20]; // enough for an integer\n      sprintf(s, \"%d\", n);\n\n      // Now check if the string s contains both 'A' and 'B'\n      int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n          if (s[i] == 'A') {\n              foundA = 1;\n          } else if (s[i] == 'B') {\n              foundB = 1;\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (foundA && foundB) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut wait: the original second program checks for the characters 'A' and 'B'. However, the string representation of an integer n will never contain the letter 'A' or 'B'? Unless the integer is in hexadecimal? But the original first program outputs the integer in base 10.\n\nTherefore, for any integer, the string will only contain digits. So foundA and foundB will always be 0. So the output will always be \"No\".\n\nBut let me check the original chain:\n\n  Example: n=10 -> first program outputs \"10\\n5\\n1\\n\" (each number with a space and then a newline? Actually: \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\")\n  Then the second program reads the first token: \"10\", which is the string \"10\". It checks: does \"10\" contain 'A'? no. 'B'? no. So outputs \"No\".\n\n  Example: if n=65? Then the first program outputs \"65 \\n\" and then ... (divisors: 65, then 5, then 1). The first token is \"65\". The string \"65\" does not contain 'A' or 'B'. So output \"No\".\n\n  Example: n=10 and then the second program reads the entire input? But it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the above C program is correct.\n\nBut note: what if the integer is negative? The original first program reads an integer. The problem does not specify, but the divisor program assumes positive? The original first program: it iterates from n-1 down to 1. So n should be at least 1? \n\nThe problem does not specify, but we can assume n>=1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must read an integer and then process.\n\nBut note: the original first program also outputs the entire divisor chain? But we are skipping that because we are not allowed to output in the intermediate. However, the second program doesn't use the rest. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the second program was reading the entire input? Then we would have to generate the entire divisor sequence in memory as a string? But the problem says: without intermediate I/O. So we can generate the string in memory? But the divisor sequence might be long? \n\nHowever, in this particular case, the second program only reads the first token. So we don't need the entire divisor sequence.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to:\n\n  - Read the integer n.\n  - Convert n to a string (without generating the entire divisor sequence).\n  - Check for 'A' and 'B' in that string.\n\nBut note: the first program also does a divisor chain. However, the divisor chain is not needed for the second program? So we can skip it entirely? \n\nYes.\n\nSo the final C program:\n\n  Reads n, converts to string, checks for 'A' and 'B', then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHowever, what if the first program had other side effects? It doesn't. It only prints.\n\nBut we are skipping the printing. The problem says: avoid intermediate I/O. So we are not printing the divisor chain. And the second program only uses the first token, which is the string of n.\n\nTherefore, we can write the program as described.\n\nBut let me double-check the first program's output: it outputs the first number as the first token. Then the rest of the tokens are the divisors. The second program only uses the first token.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are not required to compute the divisor chain? Because the second program doesn't use it. So we can avoid that computation? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      // Convert the integer n to a string\n      char s[20]; // 20 characters should be enough for any int\n      sprintf(s, \"%d\", n);\n\n      // Now check for presence of 'A' and 'B'\n      int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {\n          if (s[i] == 'A') {\n              foundA = 1;\n          } else if (s[i] == 'B') {\n              foundB = 1;\n          }\n      }\n\n      if (foundA && foundB) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nHowever, note: the second program in the original Java code is checking for the characters 'A' and 'B' in the entire string of the first token? And we are only using the first token (which is the string of n). So that matches.\n\nBut wait: what if the integer n is 0? The original first program would output \"0\" and then ... but the loop is from n-1 down to 1 -> if n=0, then i starts at -1 and goes down? But the condition is i>0, so the loop doesn't run. So the output would be \"0 \\n\". The second program would read the token \"0\". Our C program would read 0 and then check the string \"0\", which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B'. So output \"No\". So same behavior.\n\nBut note: the problem says the first program: \"int n = sc.nextInt();\" and then the loop: for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--). So if n=0, then the loop condition: i = -1, which is not >0 -> so the loop is skipped. So the output is only \"0 \\n\". So the token is \"0\". So our program is safe.\n\nBut what if n is negative? The problem does not specify. The original first program: the loop condition i>0, so for negative n, the loop is skipped. Then the first program outputs the negative number and a newline. The second program would read the token (which is the negative number as a string). We must handle negative numbers.\n\nExample: n = -10 -> the string would be \"-10\". Then we check for 'A' and 'B' in the string \"-10\". There are none, so output \"No\".\n\nIn our C program, we read with scanf(\"%d\", &n) which handles negative numbers. Then sprintf will write the negative number with a minus sign.\n\nSo we need to check the entire string including the minus sign? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we don't have to change anything.\n\nBut note: the original first program for negative n: \n  It outputs the negative number and then a space and a newline. Then the loop is skipped because i = n-1 (which is negative) and then condition i>0 fails.\n\nSo the token is the negative number. So we must represent the negative number as a string. Our sprintf does that.\n\nTherefore, the program is complete.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program had a different output for negative? Actually, the first program outputs the negative number and then a space and then a newline? But the token is the entire negative number? The second program's Scanner would read the entire negative number as a token? Yes.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the final C program:\n\n  We read an integer, convert it to a string, and then check for the presence of both 'A' and 'B' in that string. Then output accordingly.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and we are only using the first token. So we are doing exactly what the chain does.\n\nBut what if the second program had read the entire input? Then we would have to generate the entire divisor chain and then concatenate it into a string? But in this problem, it doesn't.\n\nSo we output the code accordingly.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" We are not.\n\nTherefore, the code below."
