However, what if the string is \"ABB\": \n             first='A', last='B' -> not adjacent? -> output \"Yes\". What if the string is \"ABA\": \n             first='A', last='A' -> same, but then we look: is there a distinct pair that are not adjacent? The distinct pair: A and B. The A at index0 is adjacent to B at index1? The B at index1 is adjacent to A at index2? The A at index0 and A at index2 are not adjacent? but they are the same station? -> not distinct. So the only distinct pair is (A, B) and they are adjacent? Then there is no non-adjacent distinct pair? But wait, the problem says: \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\" -> meaning for a station, if there exists a distinct station that is not adjacent to it? In \"ABA\": \n             For station A (at index0): \n                distinct stations: B -> adjacent -> so A is connected to B?

Let's use an array of linked lists? Or we can use an array of vectors (if we use C++ we could, but we are writing C).

We can do:\n\n            int* g[n];  // array of pointers to int arrays\n            int deg[n]; // degree of each node But then we need to read the edges and count the degree first.

We'll also allocate two arrays of edges: \n                   int edges[2*(n-1)]; // we will store the edges in a big array, then build adjacency lists. But we can also read and count.

But note: we are reading from standard input. We cannot rewind. So we have to store the edges. We can store the edges in an array and then build the graph. Steps:\n\n            int a[n-1], b[n-1];\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a[i], &b[i]);\n                a[i]--; b[i]--;\n                deg[a[i]]++;\n                deg[b[i]]++;\n            }\n\n          Then build g:\n\n            int* g = malloc(n * sizeof(int*));\n            int* temp_deg = calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                g[i] = malloc(deg[i] * sizeof(int));\n            }\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int u = a[i], v = b[i];\n                g[u][temp_deg[u]++] = v;\n                g[v][temp_deg[v]++] = u;\n            }\n\n          Then we can free temp_deg? Actually, we can reuse temp_deg as the current index. However, the problem says: the entire sequence. But note the constraints? The first program is from AGC014_D, which constraints: 2 <= n <= 10^5. So we must be efficient. Alternatively, we can use a single array for all edges and then use pointers. Common method:\n\n          We can do:\n\n            typedef struct {\n                int to;\n                int next;\n            } Edge;\n\n            Edge edges[2*(n-1)];\n            int head[n];\n            int edge_count = 0; But we don't know n until we read it. We can read n first, then allocate. Since we are in C, we can do:\n\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          int deg[n];\n          memset(deg, 0, n * sizeof(int));\n\n          // Read edges\n          int edges[2*(n-1)][2]; // not necessary to store as 2D, we can store as pairs in a list. But we don't need the edges after building the graph. Let me use a common method: \n\n          We'll create an array \"adj\" of size 2*(n-1). We also create an array \"head\" of size n, and set to -1. Steps:\n\n            int* adj = malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int)); // for storing the neighbors\n            int* head = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            int* next = malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            int p = 0;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) head[i] = -1;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n                a--; b--;\n                // add edge a->b\n                next[p] = head[a]; head[a] = p; adj[p] = b; p++;\n                // add edge b->a\n                next[p] = head[b]; head[b] = p; adj[p] = a; p++;\n            }\n\n          Then to traverse from node v:\n\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx ! = -1; idx = next[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                // do something\n            }\n\n      But note: the original Java code uses:\n\n          for (int w : g[v]) { ... } So we need to traverse all neighbors. However, the DFS in the original program:\n\n          static int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n              int a = 0;\n              int o = 0;\n              for (int w : g[v]) {\n                  if (w == p) continue;\n                  int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n                  a += r / 2;\n                  o += r % 2;\n              }\n              return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n          } We'll do the same. Step 5: After DFS, we compute m = result / 2, and then we set:\n\n          char *ans1;\n          if (2 * m == n) {\n              ans1 = \"Second\";\n          } else {\n              ans1 = \"First\";\n          }\n\n   Step 6: Then we check the string ans1 for containing both 'A' and 'B':\n\n          int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n          for (int i=0; ans1[i]; i++) { if (ans1[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n              if (ans1[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n          } if (foundA && foundB) {\n              printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"No\\n\");\n          }\n\n   But note: the original second program uses `contains` which is true if the character appears at least once. However, we know that \"First\" does not contain 'A' or 'B', and \"Second\" doesn't either. So we could simply:\n\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n   But to be safe and follow the specification, we do the check. Let me write the entire C program accordingly. Note: We must not do any I/O except reading at the beginning and writing at the end. Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        // We need to represent the graph.\n\n        int *adj; // adjacency list: stores the neighbor node for each edge\n        int *next_edge; // next edge in the linked list for a node\n        int *head; // head[i] is the first edge index for node i\n        int edge_count = 0;\n\n        void add_edge(int u, int v) {\n            // add edge u->v\n            adj[edge_count] = v;\n            next_edge[edge_count] = head[u];\n            head[u] = edge_count++;\n        }\n\n        int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n            int a = 0;\n            int o = 0;\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx ! = -1; idx = next_edge[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                if (w == p) continue;\n                int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n                a += r / 2;\n                o += r % 2;\n            }\n            return 2 * a + (o>0?1:0) + 1; // note: Math.min(1, o) is 1 if o>0, else 0.\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n            // Allocate for graph: n nodes, and 2*(n-1) edges\n            head = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) head[i] = -1;\n            adj = (int*)malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            next_edge = (int*)malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            edge_count = 0;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n                a--; b--;\n                add_edge(a, b);\n                add_edge(b, a);\n            }\n\n            int res = maxMatching(0, -1); int m = res / 2;\n            char *ans1;\n            if (2 * m == n) {\n                ans1 = \"Second\";\n            } else {\n                ans1 = \"First\";\n            }\n\n            // Now check the string ans1 for 'A' and 'B'\n            int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n            for (int i=0; ans1[i]; i++) {\n                if (ans1[i]=='A') foundA=1;\n                if (ans1[i]=='B') foundB=1;\n            } if (foundA && foundB) {\n                printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            }\n\n            // Free memory\n            free(head);\n            free(adj);\n            free(next_edge);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the original DFS function in Java:\n\n        return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n\n        This is equivalent to: 2*a + (o>=1?1:0) + 1. So in C: we can do: (o>0 ? 1 : 0) [if o is at least 1, then 1, else 0]\n\n        So the line: return 2*a + (o>0?1:0) + 1;\n\n   However, note: the condition (o>0?1:0) is the same as (o>=1?1:0) since o is nonnegative. But what if o is 0? then we use 0. Also note: the recursion: the base case is when we get to a leaf? Then the loop runs zero times: \n        a=0, o=0 -> returns 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. Then the parent node: for that leaf, gets r=1. a += r/2 = 1/2 = 0 (integer division) -> a=0\n        o += r%2 = 1 % 2 = 1 -> o=1\n\n        Then returns 2*0 + min(1,1) + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2. Then the grandparent: a += 2/2 = 1, o += 2%2 = 0 -> then returns 2*1 + min(1,0) + 1 = 2+0+1=3. This seems correct. However, note: integer division in Java is truncation.",

We'll free:\n\n        free(queue_bfs);\n        free(queue_proc);\n        free(res_arr);\n\n   And the graph arrays: head, adj, next_edge. But note: we allocated head, adj, next_edge at the beginning. We'll do:\n\n        // Free graph arrays\n        free(head);\n        free(adj);\n        free(next_edge);\n\n        // Free BFS and processing arrays\n        free(queue_bfs);\n        free(queue_proc);\n        free(res_arr);\n\n   However, we also allocated an array for child_count? No, we used VLAs? Actually, we declared:\n\n        int parent[n];\n        int child_count[n];\n        int unprocessed_children[n];\n\n   So these are on the stack.

For v=0: \n                idx = head[0]=0 -> w=1, parent[1]=0, then child_count[0] becomes 1. Then push 1. For v=1:\n                idx = head[1]=1 -> w=0, skip because parent[1]=0 and w==0 is parent. So parent: [0: -1, 1:0], child_count: [0:1, 1:0]\n\n        Then unprocessed_children: [0:1, 1:0] -> so queue_proc initially has node 1. Process node 1:\n            a=0, o=0 -> res_arr[1]=1. Then update parent of 1: par=0 -> unprocessed_children[0] becomes 0, so push 0. Then process node 0:\n            For v=0: traverse edges: \n                w=1 (child) -> res_arr[1]=1 -> a += 1/2=0, o += 1%2=1. Then res_arr[0] = 2*0 + (1>0?1:0) + 1 = 0+1+1=2.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs. However, note that the instruction says we are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, with the output of the first being the input to the second.\n\nLooking at the two programs:\n\n1. The first program (atcoder_AGC014_D) reads an integer `n` (number of nodes) and then `n-1` edges (each edge is two integers). It builds an undirected tree. Then it computes a value `m` and prints either \"Second\" or \"First\" based on whether `2*m == n`.\n\n2. The second program (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string and checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. If so, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\".\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is either \"First\" or \"Second\". The second program expects a string that may contain 'A' and 'B'. However, the output of the first program is either \"First\" (which contains both 'F' and 'i' but not 'A' or 'B') or \"Second\" (which contains 'S' and 'e', and also the letter 'A'? Actually: \n   \"First\" -> contains 'F', 'i', 'r', 's', 't' -> no 'A' or 'B'\n   \"Second\" -> contains 'S', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'n', 'd' -> no 'A' or 'B'\n\nSo if we run the first program and then the second program, the second program would always output \"No\" because the string from the first program does not contain both 'A' and 'B'. \n\nHowever, this seems odd. Let me reexamine the problem: \n\nThe instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nBut the first program outputs a string of either \"First\" or \"Second\", and the second program expects a string (which in the example of the second program, the example is about stations and buses, but the problem in the second program is: given a string s, if s contains both 'A' and 'B', then print \"Yes\", else \"No\").\n\nSo the chain would be:\n\nInput for the first program: \n   n and then n-1 edges.\n\nOutput of first program: either \"First\" or \"Second\"\n\nThen the second program takes that output as its input. \n\nBut the second program in the provided code is named \"atcoder_ABC158_A\", and the class inside is named \"AStationAndBus\". The problem of ABC158 A is: \n\n\"Problem Statement\nThere are three stations in the town of AtCoder, A, B, and C. They are connected by a railway line. You are given a string S of length 3, where each character is 'A', 'B', or 'C'. The i-th character of S is the station at the i-th kilometer of the railway. Determine if there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two. If so, print 'Yes'; otherwise, print 'No'.\"\n\nBut wait, the provided code for the second program does:\n\n   String s = in.next();\n   if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n        out.println(\"Yes\");\n   } else {\n        out.println(\"No\");\n   }\n\nThis does not match the problem statement. Actually, the problem ABC158 A is: \n   \"You are given a string S of length 3. If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', then output 'Yes'? But that doesn't make sense because the string is of length 3 and must contain only 'A','B','C'. Actually, the problem is: \n\n   \"We have a string S of length 3. Determine whether S can be rearranged to form the string 'ABC'? Actually no, the problem is: \n\n   The problem actually says: \"There are three stations, A, B, and C. The railway line is represented by a string S of length 3. The i-th character (0-indexed) is the station at the i-th kilometer. The railway line may not necessarily contain all three stations. However, we are to determine whether there exists a station that cannot travel directly to the other two? But the sample: \n\n   Input: \"ABA\" -> Output: \"No\"\n\n   The provided code is:\n\n        String s = in.next();\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\nBut this code does not match the problem. The problem ABC158 A is actually: \n\n   \"You are given a string S of length 3. The string is composed of 'A' and 'B'. You have to determine whether both characters appear at least once. But note: the problem says: \n\n   \"There are three stations? Actually, the problem statement in the contest: \n\n   \"Problem Statement\n   There are three stations in the town of AtCoder, A, B, and C. The railway line is represented by a string S of length 3. However, the problem then says: \n\n   \"Determine whether there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two.\"\n\n   But the provided code does not solve that. \n\n   Let me check the contest: ABC158 A: Station and Bus\n\n   The actual sample: \n      Input: \"ABA\" -> Output: \"Yes\"\n      Input: \"BBB\" -> Output: \"No\"\n\n   The provided code in the problem does:\n\n        String s = in.next();\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n   However, note that the string is of length 3 and contains only 'A','B','C'? But the problem says: the string S is composed of 'A', 'B', and 'C'. However, the provided code only checks for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n   But what if the string is \"AAA\"? Then it prints \"No\". What if the string is \"ABC\"? Then it contains both 'A' and 'B', so it prints \"Yes\". \n\n   However, the sample input \"ABA\" contains both 'A' and 'B', so it prints \"Yes\". And \"BBB\" does not contain 'A', so it prints \"No\". This matches the sample. \n\n   But wait, what about \"C\" in the string? The problem says there are three stations: A, B, and C. However, the code only checks for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'. Why?\n\n   Actually, the problem is: \n\n   \"The AtCoder Railway Company has only one railway line. The line runs from Station A to Station B, but does not run to Station C. However, the company might extend the line in the future. Currently, the company operates two-way trains between adjacent stations only. \n\n   \"You are given a string S of length 3. S may be 'AAA', 'AAC', etc. \n\n   \"The problem: There is a station that cannot be reached from the other two without changing trains? Actually, the problem asks: \n\n   \"Determine whether there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two.\n\n   But note: the stations are arranged in a line? The string S represents the stations in order from left to right. \n\n   Actually, the problem is: \n\n   \"The railway line is represented by a string S of length 3. The i-th character of S (1-indexed) is the station at the i-th stop. The stations are arranged in a row. Trains run between adjacent stops. \n\n   \"A station is said to be directly connected if they are adjacent. So station A might be at the first stop and station C at the third. Then A and C are not adjacent, so they are not directly connected. \n\n   \"Therefore, the condition for printing \"Yes\" is: there exists at least one pair of stations that are not adjacent? \n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"Determine if there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two.\" \n\n   This means: for station X, if X is not adjacent to both of the other two, then we output \"Yes\". Actually, the condition is: \n\n   - If the string is \"AAA\", then station A is at every stop. Then every station is adjacent? Actually, there is only one station? \n\n   The problem is ambiguous. But the sample: \n        \"ABA\" -> \"Yes\": because the station A is at the first and third, and station B is in the middle. Then the two A stations are not adjacent? Actually, the two A stations are at the first and third, so they are not adjacent. Therefore, the station A (at the first) is adjacent to B (at the second) but not to the A at the third? But wait, the station at the first and the station at the third are the same station? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The i-th character of S is the station at the i-th kilometer.\" So we have:\n\n        Kilometer 1: station A\n        Kilometer 2: station B\n        Kilometer 3: station A\n\n   So we have two stations: A and B. But the problem says there are three stations? Actually, the problem says \"there are three stations in the town: A, B, and C\", but the string S might not contain C.\n\n   Now, the condition: a station X is directly connected to station Y if they are adjacent in the line. So:\n\n        At kilometer 1: station A is adjacent to station B (at kilometer 2).\n        At kilometer 2: station B is adjacent to station A (at kilometer 3) and station A (at kilometer 1) -> so B is adjacent to two A's? \n\n   Actually, the problem is about the stations (by name) and the entire railway. \n\n   The key: we have three stops, and the station at each stop. Two stops are adjacent. \n\n   The condition for a station (by name) to be directly connected to another station (by name) is if there exists at least one adjacent pair of stops that have these two stations.\n\n   Therefore, station A is connected to station B because there is an adjacent pair (A at stop1 and B at stop2) and (B at stop2 and A at stop3). But station A (at stop1) is not adjacent to station A (at stop3) because they are separated by stop2.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\". \n\n   Which station? There are two stations: A and B? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"There are three stations: A, B, and C.\" But the string might not contain C. \n\n   The problem is: if the string does not contain all three stations, then we might have only two stations. Then we have:\n\n        If the string is \"AAA\", then there is only station A. Then there is no other station, so the condition fails? \n\n   But the problem states: \"Determine whether there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two.\"\n\n   If there are only two stations (say A and B), then we have:\n\n        Station A: it is connected to B? (if they are adjacent) and station B: connected to A. But there is no third station. So we cannot say \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\" because there are only two. \n\n   Actually, the problem is ambiguous. \n\n   However, the provided code is simply:\n\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n   But note: the problem also says the string may contain 'C'. The code does not check for 'C'. \n\n   Why is that? \n\n   Actually, the problem ABC158 A is: \n\n        Problem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc158/tasks/abc158_a\n\n        The problem: \n          \"We have a string S of length 3. The string is composed of 'A' and 'B'. You are to output 'Yes' if S contains both 'A' and 'B', and 'No' otherwise.\"\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says: \"The string S is composed of 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\"? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement: \n          \"The string S consists of 'A', 'B' and 'C'.\"\n\n        Then the provided code is incorrect? \n\n        However, the sample: \n            Input: \"ABA\" -> Output: \"Yes\" (because it contains both 'A' and 'B')\n            Input: \"BBB\" -> Output: \"No\"\n            Input: \"BAC\" -> Output: \"Yes\" (because it contains both 'A' and 'B')\n\n        The problem asks: \"Is there a station that cannot be reached from the other two without changing trains?\" -> This is not what the code does.\n\n        After checking the contest: \n\n        The actual problem: \n          \"AtCoder has three stations: A, B, and C. The railway line is represented by a string S. If the train service is available for every pair of stations, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, output 'No'.\"\n\n        But then the problem says: \n          \"The company provides service between stations a and b if the string S has both 'A' and 'B'? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: \n          \"The railway runs from the first station to the last. The train stops at each station in order. The company provides service between two stations if the train runs directly between them without passing through another station? \n\n        And the problem is: if there is a pair of stations that are not adjacent, then they cannot travel directly? \n\n        But the problem says: \n          \"Determine whether there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two.\"\n\n        How does the presence of both 'A' and 'B' relate? \n\n        Actually, I think the problem is: \n          The railway line is a contiguous sequence of stations. The stations are A, B, C. The train runs from the first to the last. \n\n          The condition for having a station that is not directly connected to the other two is: if the string is not \"ABC\", \"ACB\", ... meaning if the stations are not arranged in a way that every station is adjacent to every other station? \n\n        But note: the line has three stops. The stations at the stops are given. \n\n        Consider:\n\n          If the string is \"AAA\", then there is only station A. Then there is no other station, so no direct connection to other stations? But the problem says \"the other two\" (meaning two others) but there are none. So condition fails -> output \"No\".\n\n          If the string is \"ABA\", then we have stations A, B, A. Then station A (at the ends) is adjacent to B (in the middle). But station A (first) is not adjacent to station A (last) because they are separated by B. However, the problem says: \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\". \n\n          Which station? \n            Station A: \n               The other two: B and A (the last one). \n               But station A (first) is adjacent to B, but not adjacent to the last A? \n            Similarly, station B: \n               The other two: A (first) and A (last). \n               Station B is adjacent to both A's? \n            And station A (last) is adjacent to B? but not to the first A? \n\n          So station A (first) is not connected by a direct train to station A (last) (which is the same station? or different? the problem says \"station\", so same station? -> then we don't consider same station? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the other two\", meaning two other stations. So for station A, the other two stations are B and ...? There is only one other station: B. Because there are two stations: A and B. \n\n          So the problem is: if the string contains only one station, then there are no two other stations. If the string contains two stations (say A and B), then for station A, the other station is B (one station, not two). \n\n          Therefore, the condition \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\" can only happen if the string contains all three stations: A, B, and C. \n\n          Then the problem reduces to: \n            If the string contains all three stations, then we must check the arrangement. But note: in a linear arrangement of three stations, the station in the middle is directly connected to both ends, but the two ends are not directly connected. So the two end stations are not directly connected to each other. Therefore, each end station is not directly connected to one of the other two (the other end). \n\n          So if the string contains all three, then we output \"Yes\". Otherwise, if it is missing one station, then there is no station that has two others? \n\n          But the problem says: \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\" -> meaning that station must have two other distinct stations. \n\n          Therefore, if there are only two stations, then no station has two other stations, so the condition fails -> output \"No\". \n\n          If there is only one station, then also no station has two others -> output \"No\". \n\n          If there are three stations, then the two end stations are each missing a direct connection to the opposite end -> so they are not connected by a direct train to one of the other two? But wait, the problem says \"the other two\", meaning both? \n\n          Actually, the condition is: a station that is not connected by a direct train to *both* of the other two? Or to at least one of the other two? \n\n          The problem: \"not connected by a direct train to the other two\" -> meaning it is not connected to both? Or not connected to at least one? \n\n          Actually, it means: there is a station that is not connected by a direct train to one of the other two? \n\n          But the problem says \"to the other two\", meaning both? \n\n          Let me read the Japanese: \n            \u300c\u4ed6\u306e 2 \u3064\u306e\u99c5\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3068\u3082\u9244\u9053\u3067\u76f4\u901a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u99c5\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u304b\u300d -> \"whether there exists a station that is not directly connected by railway to both of the other two stations\"\n\n          So it is not connected to both? \n\n          For an end station (say A at the beginning): \n             It is directly connected to the next station (say B) but not to the last station (C). \n             Therefore, station A is not directly connected to station C -> but it is connected to B. So it is connected to one of the other two. \n\n          The condition requires that the station is not connected to *both* of the other two? \n\n          That would be the middle station? \n\n          The middle station is connected to both ends. So it is connected to both. \n\n          Therefore, no station is not connected to both of the other two? \n\n          Then we should output \"No\" for the case with three stations? \n\n          But the sample: \"ABA\" -> output \"Yes\". \n\n          So the problem must be: a station that is not connected by a direct train to *at least one* of the other two. \n\n          Actually, the problem in Japanese says: \u300c\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3068\u3082\u300d meaning \"both\". \n\n          However, the sample input \"ABA\" is expected to output \"Yes\". \n\n          Therefore, the intended meaning is: \n             \"Determine whether there is a station that is not directly connected to at least one of the other two stations.\"\n\n          But that would be true for every station? \n\n          Alternatively, the problem might be: \n             \"Determine whether there is a pair of stations that are not directly connected.\"\n\n          And if there is at least one such pair, output \"Yes\". \n\n          In a linear arrangement of three stations, the two end stations are not directly connected. So if the string has three distinct stations, then the two ends are not adjacent -> output \"Yes\". \n\n          But what if the string is \"AAB\"? \n             Stations: A, A, B.\n             The adjacent pairs: \n                1-2: A-A -> connected.\n                2-3: A-B -> connected.\n             The non-adjacent pair: 1-3: A-B -> not directly connected? \n          So output \"Yes\".\n\n          What if the string is \"AAA\"? \n             There are no two distinct stations? Then there is no pair of distinct stations that are not connected? But there is only one station. \n\n          The problem: the condition is about distinct stations. \n\n          Therefore, we output \"Yes\" if there exists at least one pair of distinct stations that are not adjacent. \n\n          How to check that? \n             If the string has at least two distinct stations and the two distinct stations appear non-adjacent at least once? \n\n          Actually, if the first and last characters are different, then they are not adjacent? \n\n          But in \"AAB\": \n             first='A', last='B' -> different -> not adjacent? \n\n          However, what if the string is \"ABB\": \n             first='A', last='B' -> not adjacent? -> output \"Yes\".\n\n          What if the string is \"ABA\": \n             first='A', last='A' -> same, but then we look: is there a distinct pair that are not adjacent? \n                The distinct pair: A and B. \n                The A at index0 is adjacent to B at index1? \n                The B at index1 is adjacent to A at index2? \n                The A at index0 and A at index2 are not adjacent? but they are the same station? -> not distinct.\n\n          So the only distinct pair is (A, B) and they are adjacent? Then there is no non-adjacent distinct pair? \n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"a station that is not connected by a direct train to the other two\" -> meaning for a station, if there exists a distinct station that is not adjacent to it? \n\n          In \"ABA\": \n             For station A (at index0): \n                distinct stations: B -> adjacent -> so A is connected to B? \n             For station B: \n                distinct stations: A -> adjacent to both A's? \n             For station A (at index2): \n                distinct stations: B -> adjacent? \n\n          So no station has a distinct station that is not adjacent? -> output \"No\"? \n\n          But the sample expected \"Yes\" for \"ABA\". \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n   After checking the sample tests of ABC158 A:\n\n        Test 1: \"ABA\" -> \"Yes\"\n        Test 2: \"BBB\" -> \"No\"\n        Test 3: \"AAB\" -> \"Yes\"\n\n   And the actual problem: \n        https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc158/submissions?f.Task=abc158_a&f.LanguageName=Java&f.Status=AC\n\n   We see that the accepted solutions are:\n\n        if (s.equals(\"AAA\") || s.equals(\"BBB\")) {\n            System.out.println(\"No\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Yes\");\n        }\n\n   Or:\n\n        System.out.println(s.matches(\".*A.*A.*\") || s.matches(\".*B.*B.*\") ? \"No\" : \"Yes\");\n\n   Actually, the intended solution: \n        Output \"No\" only when all characters are the same.\n\n   Why? \n        If all characters are the same, then there is only one station. Then there is no pair of distinct stations that are not adjacent? Actually, there is no distinct station at all. So the condition fails.\n\n        Otherwise, if there are at least two distinct stations, then there is at least one pair of distinct stations that are not adjacent? \n\n        But note: in a linear arrangement of three stops, if there are two distinct stations, then the two distinct stations must appear at least once with a gap? \n\n        Example: \n           \"AAB\": \n               The two distinct stations: A and B.\n               The first two are A, the last is B. \n               The first A is adjacent to the last B? -> no, because they are separated by the second A. \n\n        Therefore, the distinct pair (A and B) are not adjacent? -> so we output \"Yes\".\n\n        But what if the distinct stations are adjacent? \n\n        Example: \"ABB\": \n            The first station is A, then B, then B.\n            The distinct pair: A and B are adjacent at the first and second. \n            But also, the first station A and the last station B: they are not adjacent? \n\n        So there is at least one pair of distinct stations that are not adjacent? \n\n        Therefore, we output \"Yes\" if the string is not composed of the same character.\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n        if the string has all three characters the same -> output \"No\"\n        else -> output \"Yes\"\n\n   But note: the problem says there are three stations: A, B, and C. But the string might not contain C. \n\n   However, the condition: \n        \"ABA\" -> not all same -> \"Yes\"\n        \"AAB\" -> not all same -> \"Yes\"\n        \"ABC\" -> not all same -> \"Yes\"\n        \"AAA\" -> all same -> \"No\"\n        \"BBB\" -> all same -> \"No\"\n        \"CCC\" -> all same -> \"No\"\n\n   So the provided code in the problem (the second Java program) is:\n\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n            out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n   This code does not work for \"CCC\": \n        It does not contain 'A' or 'B'? Actually, it doesn't contain 'A' so the condition fails -> prints \"No\", which is correct.\n\n   But what about \"AAC\": \n        It contains 'A' but not 'B' -> prints \"No\". But according to the above, it should be \"Yes\".\n\n   So the provided code is not correct for the problem. \n\n   However, in the given context, the input to the second program is the output of the first program, which is either \"First\" or \"Second\". \n\n   The output of the first program does not contain 'C'. \n\n   And the output is either \"First\" or \"Second\", which are both strings of length 5 and 6 respectively? \n\n   But the second program expects a string of length 3? \n\n   The second program reads: \n\n        String s = in.next();\n\n   This reads a token. The token from the first program is either \"First\" or \"Second\". \n\n   So the second program is reading a string that is not of length 3. \n\n   How does the second program behave for a string of length 5 or 6? \n\n   It will check: \n        For \"First\": \n            Does it contain 'A'? -> no (because 'A' is uppercase, and \"First\" has no 'A')\n            Does it contain 'B'? -> no\n            So it prints \"No\".\n\n        For \"Second\": \n            Does it contain 'A'? -> no (it has 'e','c','o','n','d','S') -> no 'A'\n            Does it contain 'B'? -> no\n            So it prints \"No\".\n\n   Therefore, regardless of the output of the first program, the second program will always output \"No\".\n\n   This is the behavior of the chain.\n\n   Therefore, we must write a C program that:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer n and n-1 edges).\n      Step 2: Build the tree and compute the result as in the first program: \n              if (2*m == n) then we have a string \"Second\", else \"First\".\n      Step 3: Then take that string and check: \n              if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n   However, as we saw, the string from step 2 will be either \"First\" or \"Second\", neither contains 'A' or 'B'. So step 3 will always output \"No\".\n\n   But note: the first program outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\", and then the second program outputs \"No\" in both cases.\n\n   So we can simply:\n\n        Read n and the edges.\n        Compute the condition: if (2*m == n) then we have \"Second\", else \"First\".\n        Then, regardless of which string we have, we output \"No\".\n\n   However, let me double-check the first program:\n\n        The first program: \n            int m = maxMatching(0, -1) / 2;\n            out.println(2 * m == n ? \"Second\" : \"First\");\n\n        We must compute m.\n\n   But we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle. We are to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n   Therefore, we will write a C program that:\n\n        Reads the input for the first program (n and n-1 edges).\n        Builds the tree (in C, we'll use an array of vectors or linked lists for the graph).\n        Implements the recursive function `maxMatching` (with the same logic).\n        Then, instead of printing, we store the string: either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n        Then, we check the stored string: \n            if it contains both 'A' and 'B' -> then we would print \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        But as reasoned, it will never contain 'A' or 'B', so we always print \"No\".\n\n   However, note: the second program in the given code does not check for the entire string? It uses `contains` which is true if the character appears anywhere. \n\n   The string \"First\" has no 'A' or 'B'. \n   The string \"Second\" has no 'A' or 'B'. \n\n   Therefore, we can skip building the string and then scanning it, and just output \"No\".\n\n   But the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n   Therefore, we must simulate the chain exactly. Even though we know the outcome, we must follow the steps.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n      Step 1: Read n.\n      Step 2: Build graph with n nodes and n-1 edges.\n      Step 3: Run the DFS (maxMatching) starting at node 0 with parent -1.\n      Step 4: Compute m = result / 2.\n      Step 5: Check: if (2 * m == n) then we have the string \"Second\", else \"First\". \n      Step 6: Then, for the string (either \"First\" or \"Second\"), check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since neither does, we then print \"No\".\n\n   However, we can avoid constructing the string explicitly for step 5 and 6 if we know the answer to step 6 is always \"No\". But to be safe and follow the specification, we will simulate.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n      We'll have to represent the graph. We can use an array of vectors (using dynamic arrays or linked lists). But note: n can be up to 100000? \n\n      The original Java program uses ArrayList<Integer>[] g.\n\n      In C, we can do:\n\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          // We'll create an array of vectors: \n          // We can use a linked list or we can use an array of dynamic arrays.\n\n          Let's use an array of linked lists? Or we can use an array of vectors (if we use C++ we could, but we are writing C).\n\n          Alternatively, we can use an array of pointers (to struct node) but that is heavy.\n\n          Or we can use an array of arrays? But we don't know the degree.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            int* g[n];  // array of pointers to int arrays\n            int deg[n]; // degree of each node\n\n          But then we need to read the edges and count the degree first.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            1. Read n.\n            2. Allocate an array for degrees: deg = calloc(n, sizeof(int))? Or we can do VLA: int deg[n]; and set to 0.\n            3. We'll also allocate two arrays of edges: \n                   int edges[2*(n-1)]; // we will store the edges in a big array, then build adjacency lists.\n               But we can also read and count.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            // Count the degree for each node.\n            for (i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n                a--; b--;\n                deg[a]++;\n                deg[b]++;\n            }\n\n            Then allocate g[i] as an array of int of size deg[i] for each node.\n\n            Then we need to fill. We can do:\n\n                int* g[n];\n                for (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    g[i] = malloc(deg[i] * sizeof(int));\n                }\n                int temp_deg[n]; // to count while filling\n                memset(temp_deg, 0, sizeof(temp_deg));\n\n            Then read the edges again? \n\n          But note: we are reading from standard input. We cannot rewind. So we have to store the edges.\n\n          We can store the edges in an array and then build the graph.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            int a[n-1], b[n-1];\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a[i], &b[i]);\n                a[i]--; b[i]--;\n                deg[a[i]]++;\n                deg[b[i]]++;\n            }\n\n          Then build g:\n\n            int* g = malloc(n * sizeof(int*));\n            int* temp_deg = calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                g[i] = malloc(deg[i] * sizeof(int));\n            }\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int u = a[i], v = b[i];\n                g[u][temp_deg[u]++] = v;\n                g[v][temp_deg[v]++] = u;\n            }\n\n          Then we can free temp_deg? Actually, we can reuse temp_deg as the current index.\n\n      However, the problem says: the entire sequence. But note the constraints? The first program is from AGC014_D, which constraints: 2 <= n <= 10^5.\n\n      So we must be efficient.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a single array for all edges and then use pointers. Common method:\n\n          We can do:\n\n            typedef struct {\n                int to;\n                int next;\n            } Edge;\n\n            Edge edges[2*(n-1)];\n            int head[n];\n            int edge_count = 0;\n\n          But we don't know n until we read it. We can read n first, then allocate.\n\n      Since we are in C, we can do:\n\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          int deg[n];\n          memset(deg, 0, n * sizeof(int));\n\n          // Read edges\n          int edges[2*(n-1)][2]; // not necessary to store as 2D, we can store as pairs in a list.\n\n          But we don't need the edges after building the graph.\n\n      Let me use a common method: \n\n          We'll create an array \"adj\" of size 2*(n-1). We also create an array \"head\" of size n, and set to -1.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            int* adj = malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int)); // for storing the neighbors\n            int* head = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            int* next = malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            int p = 0;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) head[i] = -1;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n                a--; b--;\n                // add edge a->b\n                next[p] = head[a]; head[a] = p; adj[p] = b; p++;\n                // add edge b->a\n                next[p] = head[b]; head[b] = p; adj[p] = a; p++;\n            }\n\n          Then to traverse from node v:\n\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx != -1; idx = next[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                // do something\n            }\n\n      But note: the original Java code uses:\n\n          for (int w : g[v]) { ... }\n\n      So we need to traverse all neighbors.\n\n      However, the DFS in the original program:\n\n          static int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n              int a = 0;\n              int o = 0;\n              for (int w : g[v]) {\n                  if (w == p) continue;\n                  int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n                  a += r / 2;\n                  o += r % 2;\n              }\n              return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n          }\n\n      We'll do the same.\n\n   Step 5: After DFS, we compute m = result / 2, and then we set:\n\n          char *ans1;\n          if (2 * m == n) {\n              ans1 = \"Second\";\n          } else {\n              ans1 = \"First\";\n          }\n\n   Step 6: Then we check the string ans1 for containing both 'A' and 'B':\n\n          int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n          for (int i=0; ans1[i]; i++) {\n              if (ans1[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n              if (ans1[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n          }\n          if (foundA && foundB) {\n              printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"No\\n\");\n          }\n\n   But note: the original second program uses `contains` which is true if the character appears at least once.\n\n   However, we know that \"First\" does not contain 'A' or 'B', and \"Second\" doesn't either. So we could simply:\n\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n   But to be safe and follow the specification, we do the check.\n\n   Let me write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must not do any I/O except reading at the beginning and writing at the end.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        // We need to represent the graph.\n\n        int *adj; // adjacency list: stores the neighbor node for each edge\n        int *next_edge; // next edge in the linked list for a node\n        int *head; // head[i] is the first edge index for node i\n        int edge_count = 0;\n\n        void add_edge(int u, int v) {\n            // add edge u->v\n            adj[edge_count] = v;\n            next_edge[edge_count] = head[u];\n            head[u] = edge_count++;\n        }\n\n        int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n            int a = 0;\n            int o = 0;\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx != -1; idx = next_edge[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                if (w == p) continue;\n                int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n                a += r / 2;\n                o += r % 2;\n            }\n            return 2 * a + (o>0?1:0) + 1; // note: Math.min(1, o) is 1 if o>0, else 0.\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n            // Allocate for graph: n nodes, and 2*(n-1) edges\n            head = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) head[i] = -1;\n            adj = (int*)malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            next_edge = (int*)malloc(2 * (n-1) * sizeof(int));\n            edge_count = 0;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n                int a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n                a--; b--;\n                add_edge(a, b);\n                add_edge(b, a);\n            }\n\n            int res = maxMatching(0, -1);\n            int m = res / 2;\n            char *ans1;\n            if (2 * m == n) {\n                ans1 = \"Second\";\n            } else {\n                ans1 = \"First\";\n            }\n\n            // Now check the string ans1 for 'A' and 'B'\n            int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n            for (int i=0; ans1[i]; i++) {\n                if (ans1[i]=='A') foundA=1;\n                if (ans1[i]=='B') foundB=1;\n            }\n            if (foundA && foundB) {\n                printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            }\n\n            // Free memory\n            free(head);\n            free(adj);\n            free(next_edge);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the original DFS function in Java:\n\n        return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n\n        This is equivalent to: 2*a + (o>=1?1:0) + 1.\n\n        So in C: we can do: (o>0 ? 1 : 0)  [if o is at least 1, then 1, else 0]\n\n        So the line: return 2*a + (o>0?1:0) + 1;\n\n   However, note: the condition (o>0?1:0) is the same as (o>=1?1:0) since o is nonnegative.\n\n   But what if o is 0? then we use 0.\n\n   Also note: the recursion: the base case is when we get to a leaf? Then the loop runs zero times: \n        a=0, o=0 -> returns 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n   Then the parent node: for that leaf, gets r=1.\n\n        a += r/2 = 1/2 = 0 (integer division) -> a=0\n        o += r%2 = 1 % 2 = 1 -> o=1\n\n        Then returns 2*0 + min(1,1) + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n   Then the grandparent: a += 2/2 = 1, o += 2%2 = 0 -> then returns 2*1 + min(1,0) + 1 = 2+0+1=3.\n\n   This seems correct.\n\n   However, note: integer division in Java is truncation. In C, integer division is truncation toward zero, which for nonnegative numbers is the same.\n\n   But note: r is always positive? Because we return at least 1.\n\n   So the above should be fine.\n\n   Let me test with a small tree:\n\n        n=2: two nodes 0 and 1 connected.\n\n        maxMatching(0, -1):\n           v=0: \n               neighbors: 1.\n               w=1: \n                 r = maxMatching(1,0): \n                     v=1: \n                         neighbors: 0 (skip because p=0) -> so no children -> returns 1.\n                 a = 0 + (1/2)=0\n                 o = 0 + (1%2)=1\n                 returns 2*0 + min(1,1)+1 = 0+1+1 = 2.\n\n           Then m = 2/2 = 1.\n           2*m == 2 -> n=2 -> true -> \"Second\".\n\n        Then the second program: \"Second\" -> does it contain 'A' and 'B'? -> no -> output \"No\".\n\n        The original chain: \n            First program: n=2 -> output \"Second\"\n            Second program: input \"Second\" -> contains both 'A' and 'B'? -> no -> output \"No\"\n\n        So our program outputs \"No\", which matches.\n\n   Another test: n=1? but n>=2 per the problem.\n\n   Let me do n=3: a chain 0-1-2.\n\n        Start at 0:\n          neighbors: 1.\n          r1 = maxMatching(1,0)\n\n          For node 1 (with parent 0):\n             neighbors: 0 (skip) and 2.\n             For node 2 (with parent 1): \n                 returns 1.\n             Then for node 1: \n                 a = 1/2 = 0\n                 o = 1%2 = 1\n                 returns 2*0 + min(1,1)+1 = 2.\n\n          Then for node 0:\n             a = 2/2 = 1\n             o = 2%2 = 0\n             returns 2*1 + min(1,0)+1 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\n          m = 3/2 = 1 (integer division).\n          2*m = 2, but n=3 -> not equal -> \"First\"\n\n          Then the second program: \"First\" -> no 'A' and 'B' -> output \"No\"\n\n   Therefore, the code is written accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the DFS recursion depth might be large (n up to 100000). We should avoid stack overflow. We can use an iterative DFS? But the problem says it's a tree, so the depth is O(n). In many systems, the stack might be limited.\n\n   But the problem does not specify constraints on the recursion depth. We'll assume it's acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an iterative DFS. But the original Java program uses recursion.\n\n   Since the constraints are 10^5, recursion depth could be 10^5, which might be too deep for the stack in C.\n\n   We should use iterative DFS to avoid stack overflow.\n\n   Let me convert the DFS to iterative.\n\n   How to do iterative DFS for this function?\n\n        We need to compute the function for a node after computing it for all children.\n\n        We can do a postorder traversal.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll use a stack to store the state of the DFS.\n\n          We need to store: (v, p, current neighbor index, current a, current o)\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We do a BFS to get the order? Actually, we need a reverse level order.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            We'll compute an array parent and then traverse in reverse order.\n\n          But the tree is arbitrary.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            First, we do a BFS/DFS to compute the parent of each node and the children list.\n\n          Then we can process nodes from leaves to root.\n\n        How:\n\n          Step 1: Build the tree (with parent pointers and children lists).\n\n          Step 2: Create an array for the result of each node: res[node] = ?\n\n          Step 3: Use a queue for BFS: \n\n                Start with the root, then traverse to assign parent and children.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n                We create an array: parent[0] = -1.\n\n                Then we do a stack for DFS:\n\n                   stack.push(0, -1)\n                   while stack not empty:\n                      pop a node v and its parent p.\n                      for each neighbor w of v that is not p:\n                         push(w, v)\n\n                Then we record the children of v: all w that we pushed for which parent is v.\n\n          Then we can do a reverse BFS (using a queue that starts with leaves):\n\n                We compute the out-degree (number of children) for each node.\n\n                We start with leaves: which have out-degree 0.\n\n                Then we process the leaves and then update the parent.\n\n          Steps:\n\n                Let deg[i] = number of children of i (if we remove the parent link).\n\n                We can create:\n\n                   children = array of lists? or we can store an array for each node.\n\n                Actually, we built the graph already. We can compute the children for node v as:\n\n                   for each neighbor w of v: if w != parent[v], then w is a child.\n\n                Then we can compute the children list for each node.\n\n          Then we can do:\n\n                We create an array: res[0..n-1] for the result of the function.\n\n                We create a queue (for BFS in reverse order) that initially contains all leaves.\n\n                We also maintain the number of unprocessed children for each node: which we can set to the number of children.\n\n                For a leaf: \n                    res[leaf] = 1.\n\n                Then when we process a node v:\n\n                    a = 0\n                    o = 0\n                    for each child w of v:\n                         a += res[w] / 2;\n                         o += res[w] % 2;\n\n                    res[v] = 2 * a + (o>0?1:0) + 1;\n\n                Then we decrement the parent's unprocessed child count by one. If the parent's unprocessed child count becomes 0, then we push the parent.\n\n          But note: the original function did not separate children? It used the entire graph and skipped the parent.\n\n          This iterative method is the same.\n\n          We can do:\n\n                Step 1: Build the graph and then build a tree structure (with parent and children).\n\n                Step 2: Compute parent array with a BFS from root=0.\n\n                Step 3: Build children lists.\n\n                Step 4: Use a queue for topological sort (from leaves to root).\n\n          Code:\n\n            // BFS to assign parent\n            int parent[n];\n            int* children[n]; // array of pointers to dynamic arrays of children\n            int child_count[n]; // number of children\n\n            // Initialize\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                child_count[i] = 0;\n                parent[i] = -1;\n            }\n\n            // We'll use a queue\n            int queue[n];\n            int front=0, rear=0;\n            queue[rear++] = 0;\n            parent[0] = -1;\n\n            while (front < rear) {\n                int v = queue[front++];\n                for (int idx = head[v]; idx != -1; idx = next_edge[idx]) {\n                    int w = adj[idx];\n                    if (w == parent[v]) continue;\n                    parent[w] = v;\n                    queue[rear++] = w;\n                    child_count[v]++; // v has one more child w\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now, we know the children counts. Then we can allocate children arrays.\n\n            // Also, we create an array to store the children for each node.\n            int* children_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // we'll use an array of pointers? Actually, we can make an array for each node? \n            // But we don't want to allocate n arrays?

But to be safe for n=100000, we use iterative.\n\n   Let me write the iterative version.\n\n   Steps in main after building the graph:\n\n        Step 1: BFS to compute parent and child_count.\n\n        Step 2: Build a queue (for processing from leaves to root).\n\n        Step 3: Initialize unprocessed_children array (copy of child_count).\n\n        Step 4: For leaves (unprocessed_children[i]==0), push to queue.\n\n        Step 5: Process the queue until we get to the root.\n\n        Step 6: Then use res_arr[0] for the root.\n\n   But note: the root might be pushed only after all its children are processed.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        int parent[n];\n        int child_count[n]; // number of children for each node\n        int unprocessed_children[n];\n        // Initialize\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            parent[i] = -1;\n            child_count[i] = 0;\n        }\n\n        // BFS from root 0\n        int* queue_bfs = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n        int front_bfs = 0, rear_bfs = 0;\n        queue_bfs[rear_bfs++] = 0;\n        parent[0] = -1;\n\n        while (front_bfs < rear_bfs) {\n            int v = queue_bfs[front_bfs++];\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx != -1; idx = next_edge[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                if (w == parent[v]) continue;\n                parent[w] = v;\n                queue_bfs[rear_bfs++] = w;\n                child_count[v]++; // v has a child w\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Now, unprocessed_children = child_count\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            unprocessed_children[i] = child_count[i];\n        }\n\n        // Queue for processing leaves\n        int* queue_proc = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n        int front_proc = 0, rear_proc = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            if (unprocessed_children[i] == 0) {\n                queue_proc[rear_proc++] = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        int* res_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n        // We'll process from leaves to root\n\n        while (front_proc < rear_proc) {\n            int v = queue_proc[front_proc++];\n            int a = 0;\n            int o = 0;\n            // Traverse all neighbors that are children (i.e., skip the parent)\n            for (int idx = head[v]; idx != -1; idx = next_edge[idx]) {\n                int w = adj[idx];\n                if (w == parent[v]) continue;\n                // w is a child -> we have res_arr[w] computed\n                int r = res_arr[w];\n                a += r / 2;\n                o += r % 2;\n            }\n            res_arr[v] = 2 * a + (o>0?1:0) + 1;\n\n            // Update parent\n            int par = parent[v];\n            if (par != -1) {\n                unprocessed_children[par]--;\n                if (unprocessed_children[par] == 0) {\n                    queue_proc[rear_proc++] = par;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int res = res_arr[0];\n\n        // Then free the arrays: queue_bfs, queue_proc, res_arr\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But note: we are using the graph representation to traverse the children. The graph includes the parent link as an edge? Yes, because we built the graph as undirected. So when we traverse the neighbors, we skip the parent.\n\n   This is the same as the recursive DFS.\n\n   We'll use this iterative method to avoid recursion depth issues.\n\n   Let me put it all together.\n\n   Note: We must free all allocated memory to avoid memory leaks? But the program ends.\n\n   However, for clarity, we free.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid some allocations by using stack arrays when possible.\n\n   But we are using dynamic allocation for the graph and for the queues.\n\n   We'll free:\n\n        free(queue_bfs);\n        free(queue_proc);\n        free(res_arr);\n\n   And the graph arrays: head, adj, next_edge.\n\n   But note: we allocated head, adj, next_edge at the beginning.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        // Free graph arrays\n        free(head);\n        free(adj);\n        free(next_edge);\n\n        // Free BFS and processing arrays\n        free(queue_bfs);\n        free(queue_proc);\n        free(res_arr);\n\n   However, we also allocated an array for child_count? No, we used VLAs?
