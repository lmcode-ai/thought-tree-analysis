Actually, in Java, the expression `1 << k` when k=31 is an int: 0x80000000.

But the mask is an int mask, then promoted to long, which sets the higher 32 bits? Then the condition would be true if either the k-th bit in the lower 32 bits is set OR any bit in the higher 32 bits is set? That's not what we want. So the rec function in Java is flawed? Let me check with an example: \n        x = -1 (as an integer, then passed to rec as a long: 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) k=31: mask = 1<<31 -> int: 0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then x & mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, which is nonzero -> counts one for k=31. Then k=30: mask = 1<<30 -> int: 0x40000000 -> long: 0x0000000040000000? Actually, no: 1<<30 is positive? Then when promoted to long, it becomes 0x0000000040000000? Then AND with x (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) gives 0x0000000040000000, which is nonzero -> counts one. Similarly, for every k from 0 to 31, it will count 1? So the count is 32? That is correct because -1 has all 32 bits set. Now, what if we have a positive integer? x = 1: long value is 0x0000000000000001.\n        k=0: mask=1 -> long: 1 -> AND is 1 -> nonzero -> count=1. k=1: mask=2 -> long: 2 -> AND is 0 -> skip.\n        ... so total count=1. But what about k=31? \n        mask=0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n        x (0x0000000000000001) AND mask = 0? So it doesn't count. So it works? However, note: the mask for k=31 is 0x80000000 in int, which when promoted to long becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then when we AND with a positive integer (which has 0 in the higher bits), the result is 0? But wait: the long value of the positive integer has the higher 32 bits as 0.",

Then when passed to rec as a long, it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then for k=31: \n            mask = 1 << 31 -> int: 0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n            x & mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 -> nonzero -> count one. For k from 0 to 30: \n            mask = 1<<k -> long: ... \n            x has the lower 31 bits as 0? So AND is 0. So total count=1? Which is correct because 0x80000000 has one bit set. Now, what if we have x = 0x40000000 (positive)? In long: 0x0000000040000000. k=31: mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, then AND is 0? -> doesn't count. k=30: mask = 0x0000000040000000 -> AND is 0x0000000040000000 -> nonzero -> counts one. Then k=0 to 29: 0 -> so total count=1? Correct. It seems to work. Why?\n\n   Because for k=31, the mask has the lower 32 bits as 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF. The value x has the higher 32 bits as 0. So the AND is 0? But note: the mask for k=31: the lower 32 bits are 0x80000000. The x has the lower 32 bits as 0x40000000. So the AND in the lower 32 bits is 0? So it works. The flaw is that the mask for k=31 is 0x80000000 in the lower 32 bits, and the condition tests the entire 64 bits. But if the integer is positive, the higher 32 bits of x are 0, and the mask has higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF, so the AND in the higher bits is 0. The condition is then the same as the lower 32 bits having the bit set? Actually, no: the condition is true if any bit in the entire 64-bit mask is set in the result. The mask has the lower 32 bits set to 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits set to 0xFFFFFFFF.",

So for positive integers, the condition for k=31 is always false. Therefore, the rec function actually counts the bits in the lower 32 bits correctly?

In 64-bit two's complement: \n                absolute value: 2^31 = 0x80000000 (in 64 bits: 0x0000000080000000)\n                then negate: invert and add one: \n                    invert: 0xFFFFFFFF7FFFFFFF\n                    add one: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. So the representation is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then the mask for k=31: 1LL<<31 = 0x0000000080000000. Then x_val & mask = 0x0000000080000000? Because:\n\n            0xFFFFFFFF80000000\n            &\n            0x0000000080000000\n            = 0x0000000080000000 -> nonzero -> counts. So it counts for k=31. For k=0 to 30: the mask is 1<<k, which is in the lower 31 bits. The x_val has the lower 31 bits as 0? So no. So count=1 -> correct. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            int count = 0;\n            long long x_val = (long long) x;   // sign extend to 64 bits\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                long long mask = 1LL < < k;\n                if (x_val & mask) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an unsigned approach: \n\n            unsigned int u = (unsigned int) x;   // reinterpret the bits\n            then count the bits in u.\n\n        But note: the Java program counts the bits in the two's complement representation? Actually, the number of 1 bits in the 32-bit two's complement representation.",

Example: Input: n=2, numbers: 1 and 2. For 1: unsigned: 1 -> bits: only bit0 -> count=1 -> freq[1] becomes 1. For 2: unsigned: 2 -> bits: bit1 -> count=1 -> freq[1] becomes 2.

For 3: 3 in binary: 11 -> count=2 -> freq[2]=1. Then total_pairs = (2*1/2) + (1*0/2) = 1. Then output 0. But wait: the total_pairs for the group of count=1 is 1. Then output 0.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. The output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n\nFirst, let's understand each program:\n\n**File 1: codeforces_272_B**\n\nThis program:\n1. Reads an integer `n`.\n2. Reads `n` integers, and for each integer `x`, it computes `rec(x)` which counts the number of 1 bits in `x` (for 32 bits, from bit 31 down to 0).\n3. Then, it maintains an array `a` of size 33 (index 0 to 32) that counts the frequency of each bit count (i.e., `a[i]` is the count of numbers that have `i` ones).\n4. Then, for each frequency `a[i]` (for i from 0 to 32), it computes:\n   `summ = (1 + a[i] - 1) / 2.0 * (a[i] - 1)`\n   which simplifies to `(a[i] * (a[i]-1)) / 2.0`.\n   This is the combination formula for choosing 2 items from `a[i]` items, i.e., the number of pairs.\n5. The total `answer` is the sum of these pairs for each frequency.\n6. Finally, it prints `(long) answer`.\n\nSo the output of this program is a single integer (the total number of pairs of numbers that have the same number of 1 bits).\n\n**File 2: atcoder_ABC178_A**\n\nThis program:\n1. Reads an integer `x`.\n2. Sets `bool` to `true` if `x` is 1, otherwise `false`.\n3. Then, sets `result` to 1 if `bool` is false (i.e., if `x` is not 1) and 0 if `bool` is true (i.e., if `x` is 1).\n   This is equivalent to: `result = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1`.\n4. Prints `result`.\n\nSo the second program takes an integer and outputs 0 if the integer is 1, and 1 otherwise.\n\nNow, we are to chain these two: the output of the first program becomes the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, the entire process:\n1. The first program reads a list of integers and computes a single integer (the number of pairs) and prints it.\n2. The second program reads that integer and outputs 1 if it is not 1, and 0 if it is 1.\n\nBut note: the second program only reads one integer. The first program outputs exactly one integer.\n\nHowever, the first program might output 0, 1, 3, 6, ... (the triangular numbers) but note that the second program only cares if that integer is 1 or not.\n\nBut wait: the first program's output is a long integer, and the second program reads an integer. This is acceptable.\n\nWe are to write a single C program that does the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\nSteps for the C program:\n\n1. Read the input as the first program does: first integer `n`, then `n` integers.\n2. Process these integers to compute the number of pairs of numbers that have the same number of 1 bits (as the first program does).\n3. Then, without printing, use that computed number (let's call it `total_pairs`) as the input to the second program's logic: if `total_pairs` is 1, then output 0; otherwise output 1.\n\nHowever, note that the second program only outputs 0 or 1.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs 1? Then the second outputs 0. Otherwise, the second outputs 1.\n\nBut note: the first program's output is the total number of pairs. How often is that 1? It can be 1 if and only if there are exactly two numbers with the same bit count (and no other pairs) because the formula for one frequency `a[i]` is `a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2`. So if we have one group of 2 numbers: that gives 1 pair. Then total pairs is 1.\n\nBut if we have two groups? For example, one group of 3 (which gives 3 pairs) and another group of 2 (which gives 1 pair) -> total 4. So 1 is only when there is exactly one pair and no other pairs.\n\nBut note: the first program counts the pairs for each group and adds them. So if we have two groups of 2, then we have 1 (from the first group) + 1 (from the second group) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get 1 is to have exactly one group that has exactly 2 elements (and no other groups with more than 1 element? Actually, groups of 1 element contribute 0). So one group of 2: total pairs=1.\n\nSo the chain:\n\nInput: \n  n\n  n integers\n\nOutput:\n  0 if the total number of pairs (computed by the first program) is 1, else 1.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs 1 for any input that is not 1. So if the total pairs is 0, 2, 3, ... then output 1.\n\nSo the entire C program:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n integers.\n3. For each integer, count the number of 1 bits (for 32 bits, we can use a 32-bit integer, but note the input numbers are integers, so we assume 32-bit).\n4. Count the frequency of each bit count (from 0 to 32).\n5. Compute the total pairs: for each frequency f, total_pairs += (f * (f-1)) / 2. (Note: integer division is okay because f*(f-1) is even, but we can do with integer arithmetic. However, the original Java used double and then cast to long. We can do the same: but note that the total_pairs might be large, so we use long. But the second program only checks if it's 1, so we don't need the exact value beyond that? Actually we do: we have to check if it's 1. But note: the total_pairs is an integer. We can compute it as an integer.\n\nHowever, the Java program did:\n   double summ = (1 + a[i] - 1) / 2.0 * (a[i] - 1); \n   which is actually: (a[i] * (a[i]-1)) / 2.0.\n\nBut note: the expression in Java: (1 + a[i] - 1) is a[i]. Then multiplied by (a[i]-1) and then divided by 2.0? Actually, the expression is:\n   (1 + a[i] - 1) = a[i]\n   then: a[i] * (a[i]-1) / 2.0\n\nBut the division by 2.0 makes it a double. Then the entire answer is cast to long.\n\nWe can compute the total_pairs as an integer: since (a[i]*(a[i]-1)) is even, so we can do integer division by 2.\n\nBut to be safe, we do the same: use a long for total_pairs and compute each term as (long) a[i] * (a[i]-1) / 2.\n\nBut note: the frequency counts are integers (nonnegative) and the product might be large? The maximum frequency is n, which can be up to 10^5? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we can use long.\n\nHowever, the second program only needs to know if total_pairs is 1. So we don't care about the exact value if it's not 1? But we have to compute the exact total_pairs to check if it's 1.\n\nBut note: the second program is very simple: output 0 if total_pairs is 1, else 1.\n\nSo in C:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n2. Allocate an array for n integers? Actually, we don't need to store the integers, we only need the frequency of bit counts.\n3. We'll create an array `freq` of 33 integers (index 0 to 32) initialized to 0.\n4. For i from 0 to n-1:\n      read an integer x.\n      count = 0;\n      for each bit in x (from 0 to 31): count the number of 1 bits.\n      freq[count]++;\n\n5. total_pairs = 0;\n   for i from 0 to 32:\n        if (freq[i] >= 2) {\n            total_pairs += (long long) freq[i] * (freq[i]-1) / 2;\n        }\n\n   Note: We use long long to avoid overflow? The maximum frequency is n (which can be 10^5) then the term is about 5e9, which fits in long long.\n\n6. Then, if total_pairs == 1, output 0; else output 1.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java outputs 1 for any input that is not 1. So:\n\n   if (total_pairs == 1) \n        printf(\"0\\n\");\n   else\n        printf(\"1\\n\");\n\nBut wait: the second program in Java is:\n\n   int x = ...;   // the total_pairs from the first program\n   bool = (x == 1) ? true : false;\n   result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\n   So if x is 1, result is 0; otherwise 1.\n\nTherefore, we output 0 when total_pairs is 1, and 1 otherwise.\n\nHowever, note: the first program in Java uses a double and then casts to long. But the total_pairs is an integer. Our method using integer arithmetic will give the same result.\n\nBut note: the double might lose precision for very large numbers? The problem says the input n can be up to 100000. The maximum total_pairs: if all numbers have the same bit count, then the pairs are C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2. For n=100000, that is about 5e9, which is within the range of double (exactly representable for integers up to 2^53). But the Java program then casts to long. We are doing integer arithmetic with long long (which is at least 64 bits) so we are safe.\n\nBut note: the original Java program uses an array of 33 integers. We do the same.\n\nImplementation:\n\nWe'll read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nWe don't need to use any buffered reader in C, we can use scanf.\n\nSteps in C:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n        int freq[33] = {0}; // indices 0..32\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            int count = 0;\n            // Count the bits in x: for 32 bits, we can do by shifting.\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (x & (1 << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n            // Alternatively, we can use __builtin_popcount, but the problem says to be portable? \n            // Let's do with a loop to be safe.\n            // But note: the Java program loops from 31 down to 0. We can do from 0 to 31: same total.\n            freq[count]++;\n        }\n\n        long long total_pairs = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) {\n            if (freq[i] >= 2) {\n                total_pairs += (long long) freq[i] * (freq[i] - 1) / 2;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Now, if total_pairs is 1, output 0; else output 1.\n        if (total_pairs == 1) {\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\nBut note: the Java program's rec function uses a loop from 31 down to 0. We do from 0 to 31: that counts the same bits.\n\nHowever, what if the number is negative? The Java program uses `long x` in the parameter? Actually, the rec function takes a `long x`. But the input numbers are read as integers (sc.nextInt()) and then passed to rec which takes long. So if the integer is negative, it will be sign-extended to a long? \n\nBut note: the Java nextInt() returns a 32-bit signed integer. Then it is promoted to long, which is 64-bit, and then the rec function checks bits 31 to 0? Actually, the loop in rec is for k from 31 down to 0: so it only checks the lower 32 bits? Because the long has 64 bits, but the original number was 32 bits. However, when we have a negative integer, the sign extension will set the upper 32 bits to 1. So the rec function would count the 1 bits in the entire 64 bits? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\n   rec(sc.nextInt()): the nextInt() returns an int, which is then promoted to long. Then the rec function loops k from 31 down to 0: \n        if (x & (1 << k)) \n\n   But note: 1 << k is an integer. Then the expression (x & (1<<k)): because x is long and (1<<k) is int, it will be promoted to long? And then the bitwise and. However, k goes from 31 down to 0, so 1<<k is within the 32-bit integer. So it only checks the lower 32 bits? \n\n   Actually, if k is 31, then 1<<31 is 0x80000000, which is a negative int. When promoted to long, it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? No, actually: the sign extension: so the long value of (1<<31) is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n   But wait: the Java specification says that the shift operator for int shifts within 0 to 31. And when we do (1 << k) for k=31, we get 0x80000000. Then when we promote that int to long, we get 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? Actually, no: in Java, the promotion of an int to long is by sign extension. So negative int becomes negative long. Then the expression (x & (1<<k)) for a negative x? \n\n   However, the original input was an int. Then passed to rec as a long. So if the input was -1 (which is 0xFFFFFFFF in int), then as long it becomes 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Then when we do (1 << 31) we get a long: 0x0000000080000000? Or 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n   Actually, the expression `1 << k` in the condition: the `1` is an integer. So when k>=32, it would be undefined? But k goes from 31 down to 0. So k is at most 31. So we are shifting 1 to positions 0 to 31. Then the expression `(x & (1 << k))`:\n\n   - The `1 << k` is an integer. Then it is promoted to long by sign extension? Because the operation is between a long (x) and an int (1<<k). The int is promoted to long.\n\n   But note: if k is 31, then 1<<31 is an int that is negative (because the sign bit is set). When we convert that negative int to long, we get a long with the same value? Actually, the value is preserved: so the long value is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n   Then the bitwise AND with x (which is a long) would include the sign extension. But the original input was a 32-bit integer. So the x in rec is the 32-bit integer extended to 64 bits by sign extension. Therefore, the bits 32 to 63 are all the same as bit 31. \n\n   However, the rec function only checks k from 31 down to 0. For k=31, it checks the bit at position 31 (which is the sign bit of the original integer) and also the same bit is repeated in the higher bits? Actually, the condition `(x & (1 << k))` for k=31: the `1<<k` in the long context is 0x80000000 (if we consider only 32 bits) but when promoted to long, it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n   Actually, in Java, the expression `1 << k` when k=31 is an int: 0x80000000. Then when we do `x & (1 << k)`, the `1<<k` is first promoted to long: so if the int is negative, the long becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then when we AND with x (which is the sign-extended original integer), the higher 32 bits are all 1s for negative numbers. Then the condition `(x & (1 << k)) != 0` for k=31: \n        x = (if the original integer was negative) has 1s in the higher bits, and the mask 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 has 1 in the highest 32 bits? Actually, the mask 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 has the lower 32 bits as 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF? \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the rec function is intended to count the number of 1 bits in the lower 32 bits? Because the input is an integer. The problem says the input numbers are integers.\n\n   But the Java program uses a long in the rec function. Why? Maybe to avoid the negative shift issues? \n\n   Actually, the condition: `(x & (1 << k)) != 0` for k in [31,0] and x as a long: \n\n        For k in [31,0]: the mask (1<<k) as a long is the same as 1L << k? \n\n        But the program writes `1 << k` (which is an int) and then promotes to long. For k=31, that mask is 0x80000000 as an int, and then when converted to long, it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n        Then when we AND with x (which is a long that is the sign-extended integer), the higher bits are set. But we are only interested in k from 31 to 0, so we are only testing the lower 32 bits? \n\n        Actually, the condition is testing the k-th bit of the lower 32 bits? Because the mask has the k-th bit set in the lower 32 bits and the higher 32 bits are set? Then when we AND with x, the k-th bit in the lower 32 bits will be set if the original integer had that bit set? But the higher bits in the mask are set, and x has the higher bits set if the integer was negative. Then the entire long value of (x & mask) would be nonzero even if the k-th bit in the lower 32 bits is set? \n\n        Actually, the condition is just checking if the k-th bit is set? Because the mask has the k-th bit set and the rest 0 in the lower 32 bits? But wait, the mask has the higher 32 bits set? Then the AND would include the higher 32 bits? \n\n        This is incorrect: the rec function should only count the bits in the lower 32 bits. But the mask is an int mask, then promoted to long, which sets the higher 32 bits? Then the condition would be true if either the k-th bit in the lower 32 bits is set OR any bit in the higher 32 bits is set? That's not what we want.\n\n   So the rec function in Java is flawed? \n\n   Let me check with an example: \n        x = -1 (as an integer, then passed to rec as a long: 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)\n        k=31: mask = 1<<31 -> int: 0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n        Then x & mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, which is nonzero -> counts one for k=31.\n\n        Then k=30: mask = 1<<30 -> int: 0x40000000 -> long: 0x0000000040000000? \n        Actually, no: 1<<30 is positive? Then when promoted to long, it becomes 0x0000000040000000? Then AND with x (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) gives 0x0000000040000000, which is nonzero -> counts one.\n\n        Similarly, for every k from 0 to 31, it will count 1? So the count is 32? That is correct because -1 has all 32 bits set.\n\n   Now, what if we have a positive integer? \n        x = 1: long value is 0x0000000000000001.\n        k=0: mask=1 -> long: 1 -> AND is 1 -> nonzero -> count=1.\n        k=1: mask=2 -> long: 2 -> AND is 0 -> skip.\n        ... so total count=1.\n\n   But what about k=31? \n        mask=0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n        x (0x0000000000000001) AND mask = 0? So it doesn't count.\n\n   So it works? \n\n   However, note: the mask for k=31 is 0x80000000 in int, which when promoted to long becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. Then when we AND with a positive integer (which has 0 in the higher bits), the result is 0? \n\n   But wait: the long value of the positive integer has the higher 32 bits as 0. The mask has the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF? Then the AND would be 0? \n\n   So the rec function actually counts the bits in the lower 32 bits correctly? \n\n   However, the mask for k=31: the bit in the lower 32 bits is at position 31. The mask as a long has the bit at position 31 set and also the bits 32 to 63 set? Then when we AND with x, we are testing the bit at position 31 and also the bits 32 to 63? But x (the sign-extended integer) for a positive integer has 0 in bits 32 to 63? Then the AND will be 0? \n\n   Actually, the mask for k=31: \n        as a long: it has bits 31 and also 32 to 63 set? \n        But the original integer only has 32 bits. The long representation of the integer is the sign extension. So for positive, bits 32 to 63 are 0. Then the AND of the mask (which has bits 32 to 63 set) with x (which has 0 in the higher bits) is 0? \n\n   So the condition is false for k=31 for positive integers? \n\n   But we want to check the bit at position 31? \n\n   The mask 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 has the bit at position 31 set? Actually, in 64 bits, the mask is:\n\n        0xFFFFFFFF80000000 = binary: \n          1111111111111111111111111111111110000000000000000000000000000000\n\n        The bit at position 31 is the 32nd bit from the right? Actually, bit numbering: \n          bit 0 is the least significant.\n          bit 31 is the 32nd bit? \n\n        How does Java define the shift? The expression `1 << k` for k=31 in an int sets bit 31? Then when we convert to long, we get a long that has bit 31 set? But also the sign extension sets the higher 32 bits? \n\n        Then when we AND with x, we are testing the entire 64 bits? \n\n        We only want to test bit 31 of the original integer? \n\n        The original integer, when stored in a long, has the same lower 32 bits as the integer, and the higher 32 bits are the sign extension. The mask has the lower 32 bits as 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF. \n\n        Then the condition `(x & mask) != 0` will be true if either:\n          - the original integer had the bit 31 set (so the mask's lower 32 bits match) OR\n          - the original integer was negative (so the sign bit is set, and the mask's higher 32 bits are all set, so the AND in the higher bits will be the sign bits of x, which are set) -> so the entire value is nonzero.\n\n        Actually, if the integer is negative, then the higher 32 bits of x are set, and the mask also has the higher 32 bits set, so the AND in the higher bits is set. And the condition is true regardless of the lower 32 bits? \n\n        That is not what we want: we only want to count the bits in the lower 32 bits.\n\n   Therefore, the rec function in the Java program is incorrect for counting the bits in the original 32-bit integer? \n\n   Let me test with x = 0x80000000 (which is the most negative integer). \n        In Java, 0x80000000 is an int that is negative. Then when passed to rec as a long, it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n        Then for k=31: \n            mask = 1 << 31 -> int: 0x80000000 -> long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n            x & mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 -> nonzero -> count one.\n        For k from 0 to 30: \n            mask = 1<<k -> long: ... \n            x has the lower 31 bits as 0? So AND is 0.\n        So total count=1? Which is correct because 0x80000000 has one bit set.\n\n   Now, what if we have x = 0x40000000 (positive)? \n        In long: 0x0000000040000000.\n        k=31: mask = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, then AND is 0? -> doesn't count.\n        k=30: mask = 0x0000000040000000 -> AND is 0x0000000040000000 -> nonzero -> counts one.\n        Then k=0 to 29: 0 -> so total count=1? Correct.\n\n   It seems to work. Why?\n\n   Because for k=31, the mask has the lower 32 bits as 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF. The value x has the higher 32 bits as 0. So the AND is 0? \n\n   But note: the mask for k=31: the lower 32 bits are 0x80000000. The x has the lower 32 bits as 0x40000000. So the AND in the lower 32 bits is 0? \n\n   So it works.\n\n   The flaw is that the mask for k=31 is 0x80000000 in the lower 32 bits, and the condition tests the entire 64 bits. But if the integer is positive, the higher 32 bits of x are 0, and the mask has higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF, so the AND in the higher bits is 0. The condition is then the same as the lower 32 bits having the bit set? \n\n   Actually, no: the condition is true if any bit in the entire 64-bit mask is set in the result. The mask has the lower 32 bits set to 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits set to 0xFFFFFFFF. The x has the lower 32 bits set to the original integer and the higher 32 bits set to the sign extension (0 for positive, 0xFFFFFFFF for negative). \n\n   Then for a positive integer: the higher 32 bits of x are 0, so the AND in the higher bits is 0. The condition is then determined by the lower 32 bits: which is (x_lower & mask_lower) != 0.\n\n   For a negative integer: the higher 32 bits of x are 0xFFFFFFFF, and the mask has the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF, so the AND in the higher bits is 0xFFFFFFFF, which is nonzero. So the condition is true regardless of the lower 32 bits? \n\n   But that is not what we want: we want to count the bits in the lower 32 bits. For a negative integer, the lower 32 bits might not have the k-th bit set? \n\n   Example: x = 0xFFFFFFFF (which is -1) -> then the lower 32 bits are all ones. So every k from 0 to 31 should be counted. And the condition for k=31: the mask has the lower 32 bits as 0x80000000 and the higher 32 bits as 0xFFFFFFFF. The x is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. The AND is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, which is nonzero -> counts. Similarly for other k.\n\n   But what if we have a negative integer that does not have the bit 31 set? That is impossible because the sign bit (bit 31) must be set for negative integers in two's complement.\n\n   So for negative integers, the bit 31 is always set. Then the condition for k=31 is always true for negative integers. And for positive integers, the condition for k=31 is true only if the integer has the bit 31 set? But positive integers cannot have bit 31 set? Because that would make them negative. So for positive integers, the condition for k=31 is always false.\n\n   Therefore, the rec function actually counts the bits in the lower 32 bits correctly? \n\n   However, the mask for k=31 is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000, which is a negative long. But the condition is just checking if the entire long is nonzero. \n\n   So we can do the same in C: \n\n        We are reading an integer x (which is 32 bits). Then we want to count the number of 1 bits in its 32-bit representation.\n\n        But note: the Java program uses a long to represent the integer, and then checks bits 31 to 0 with a mask that is an int shifted and then promoted to long.\n\n        In C, we can do:\n\n            long long x = (long long) num;   // but note: num is a 32-bit integer, so sign-extended to 64 bits.\n\n        Then for k from 31 down to 0:\n\n            if (x & (1LL << k))   // but wait, if we use 1<<k, that is an int. We should use 1LL to avoid issues.\n\n        However, the Java program used 1 (an int) and then promoted to long. In C, we can do:\n\n            long long mask = (long long)(1) << k;\n\n        Then if (x & mask) ...\n\n        But note: the Java program used k from 31 down to 0. We can do the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an unsigned integer to avoid sign extension issues? But the problem says the input is signed.\n\n        However, we can simply use:\n\n            int count = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (x & (1LL << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: the Java program loops from 31 down to 0. The order does not matter.\n\n        But the mask: 1LL << k for k=31: that is 0x80000000 in 64 bits? Then when we AND with x (which is sign-extended to 64 bits) we get the same as Java? \n\n        Actually, in C, if we have a negative integer stored in a signed long long, then the representation is two's complement. The sign extension is the same as in Java.\n\n        However, in C, shifting a signed integer left by k where k might cause overflow is undefined behavior? \n\n        But k is from 0 to 31, so 1LL << k is defined for k up to 63.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            long long x_val = (long long) x;   // x is the integer we read.\n\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                long long mask = 1LL << k;\n                if (x_val & mask) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        This counts the bits in the lower 32 bits? \n\n        Example: x = -1 -> x_val = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Then for every k in [0,31], the mask has one bit set, and the AND is nonzero -> count=32.\n\n        x = 1 -> count=1.\n\n        x = 0x80000000: \n            as an int: it is negative. Then as long long: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? Actually, in C, the conversion of a negative int to long long is sign extension, so it becomes 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n            But wait: 0x80000000 is 2^31, which is 2147483648, which is beyond the range of a 32-bit signed int? Actually, it is the minimum integer: -2147483648.\n\n            Then the long long value is -2147483648, which in two's complement is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n            Then for k=31: mask = 1LL<<31 -> 0x0000000080000000? \n            Then x_val & mask = 0? -> because 0xFFFFFFFF80000000 & 0x0000000080000000 = 0? \n\n            This is not correct.\n\n        Why? \n\n        In C, the constant 1LL is a signed long long. Then 1LL<<31 is 0x80000000 in the lower 64 bits? Actually, 1LL<<31 = 2^31, which is 2147483648. Then when we store it in a signed long long, it is positive. Then the representation is 0x0000000080000000.\n\n        Now, the variable x_val is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? Actually, the representation of -2147483648 in a 64-bit long long is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n        Actually, no: the representation of -2147483648 in 64 bits is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000? \n\n        Let me check: \n            -2147483648 is -2^31.\n            In 64-bit two's complement: \n                absolute value: 2^31 = 0x80000000 (in 64 bits: 0x0000000080000000)\n                then negate: invert and add one: \n                    invert: 0xFFFFFFFF7FFFFFFF\n                    add one: 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n\n        So the representation is 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.\n\n        Then the mask for k=31: 1LL<<31 = 0x0000000080000000.\n\n        Then x_val & mask = 0x0000000080000000? Because:\n\n            0xFFFFFFFF80000000\n            &\n            0x0000000080000000\n            = 0x0000000080000000 -> nonzero -> counts.\n\n        So it counts for k=31.\n\n        For k=0 to 30: the mask is 1<<k, which is in the lower 31 bits. The x_val has the lower 31 bits as 0? So no.\n\n        So count=1 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            int count = 0;\n            long long x_val = (long long) x;   // sign extend to 64 bits\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                long long mask = 1LL << k;\n                if (x_val & mask) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an unsigned approach: \n\n            unsigned int u = (unsigned int) x;   // reinterpret the bits\n            then count the bits in u.\n\n        But note: the Java program counts the bits in the two's complement representation? Actually, the number of 1 bits in the 32-bit two's complement representation. \n\n        For negative numbers, the two's complement representation has the bits set as per the negative number. \n\n        We can use:\n\n            int count = __builtin_popcount(x);   // but this is for unsigned int? Actually, for signed it does the same: the bit pattern.\n\n        But to be portable and without builtins, we can do:\n\n            unsigned int u = (unsigned int) x;\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (u & (1U << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        This is simpler and avoids the sign extension issues.\n\n        However, the Java program uses the sign-extended long. But the original integer is 32 bits. So the number of 1 bits is the same as in the unsigned representation of the 32 bits.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            unsigned int u = x;   // When x is negative, this is the two's complement representation.\n            int count = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (u & (1U << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: shifting a 32-bit unsigned by k (0 to 31) is defined.\n\n        I think this is simpler and more efficient.\n\n        But the problem says: without builtins? We are allowed to do a loop.\n\n        However, the original Java program did a loop from 31 down to 0. We can do 0 to 31: same.\n\n        So we'll use:\n\n            unsigned int u = (unsigned int) x;\n            int count = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (u & (1U << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        This counts the number of 1 bits in the 32-bit representation.\n\n   Therefore, we can change the inner loop to use an unsigned integer.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same method as the Java program with long long, but the unsigned method is simpler.\n\n   Let's use the unsigned method.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n.\n        freq[33] = {0}\n        for i=0 to n-1:\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            unsigned int u = x;\n            int count = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                if (u & (1U << k)) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n            freq[count]++;\n\n   Then compute total_pairs.\n\n   Then output 0 if total_pairs==1, else 1.\n\n   We'll write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: we must include stdio.h.\n\n   Also note: the array `freq` has 33 elements (0..32).\n\n   Let me test with a small example.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: n=2, numbers: 1 and 2.\n        For 1: unsigned: 1 -> bits: only bit0 -> count=1 -> freq[1] becomes 1.\n        For 2: unsigned: 2 -> bits: bit1 -> count=1 -> freq[1] becomes 2.\n        Then total_pairs = (freq[1]*(freq[1]-1))/2 = (2*1)/2 = 1.\n        Then output 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: n=3, numbers: 1,2,3.\n        For 1: count=1 -> freq[1]=1.\n        For 2: count=1 -> freq[1]=2.\n        For 3: 3 in binary: 11 -> count=2 -> freq[2]=1.\n        Then total_pairs = (2*1/2) + (1*0/2) = 1.\n        Then output 0.\n\n   But wait: the total_pairs for the group of count=1 is 1. Then output 0.\n\n   However, if we have n=3: 1, 2, 4 (all with count=1) -> then freq[1]=3 -> pairs = 3*2/2 = 3 -> output 1.\n\n   So the program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int freq[33] = {0}; // initialize to 0\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int x;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n                unsigned int u = (unsigned int) x;\n                int count = 0;\n                for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {\n                    if (u & (1U << k)) {\n                        count++;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (count <= 32) { // safety\n                    freq[count]++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            long long total_pairs = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] >= 2) {\n                    total_pairs += (long long) freq[i] * (freq[i] - 1) / 2;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (total_pairs == 1) {\n                printf(\"0\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"1\\n\");\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   This should work.\n\n   Let me test with the examples above.\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain is only interested in whether the total_pairs is 1 or not.\n\n   We are done."
