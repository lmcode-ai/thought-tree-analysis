Let F(i, r) = the number of ways for the suffix of length i (the last i digits) to form remainder r mod 13.

But the problem says to chain the two programs. So we do as above. But note: the first program's output might be huge? The min_value might be a very big long. The conversion to string: we use a buffer of size 50, which is safe for long (max 20 digits). Also, the dp array for the second program: the length n is at most 20, so we can do a 20x13 array. Steps in C:\n\n        Step 1: Read N and x, then the list of N longs. Step 2: Compute the costList (a 2D array of N x N). Step 3: For k from 0 to N-1:\n\n                  total = k * x;\n                  for i=0 to N-1:\n                      total += costList[i][k];\n\n                  if total is the minimum so far, remember it.

However, the Java code does not initialize the entire dp array to zero at the beginning? It only initializes the current row by accumulating from the previous row? Actually, in Java, the dp array is created and then updated. We are doing the same: we set to zero initially and then update. But note: the base state (i=0) is handled by the condition: if (i==0) we use the base state (only r_prev=0 has count 1). Then we update the first row. Then for the next row, we use the first row as the previous. This is the same. However, we must note: the modulus for the base: base = (base * 10) % 13; -> that is correct. Finally, we output dp[n-1][5] mod MOD. But note: the dp array we built is for the entire string. The last row (i = n-1) is the state after processing the entire string? And we want the remainder 5. Therefore, we output dp[n-1][5]. However, the Java code does: dp[dp.length-1][5] -> which is the last row and the 5-th column.

But note: the dp array we built: the row index i corresponds to the i-th digit from the end. So after processing the entire string (n digits) we have the state at row n-1. So we output dp[n-1][5]. However, we must note: the base state is at i=-1? and we are using i from 0 to n-1. So the above code is correct. But note: the state transition for the first row (i=0) is:\n\n        We have a digit d0 (the last digit) and we do:\n\n          new_r = (d0 * 1 + 0) % 13 = d0 % 13. Then we set dp[0][d0%13] += 1. Then for the next row (i=1): we have digit d1 (the next to last) and base = 10 mod 13. For each previous remainder r_prev (which is d0%13, and only that state has count 1), we do:\n\n          new_r = (d1 * 10 + d0) % 13. Then set dp[1][new_r] = 1. Then for the next digit, etc.\n\n     This is building the number mod 13. Then at the end, we get the entire number mod 13 at row n-1. But the problem asks for mod 5?",

The Java program uses long. In Java, long is 64 bits. In C, long may be 32 bits? On Windows, long is 32 bits? We use long long for the first program's total? But the problem says long. To be safe, we use long long for the total_cost and min_total. Change:\n\n        long long min_total = LLONG_MAX;\n        for (int k=0; k<N; k++) {\n            long long total = (long long)k * x;\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                total += costList[i][k];\n            }\n            if (total < min_total) {\n                min_total = total;\n            }\n        }\n\n     And then convert:\n\n        char str[50];\n        sprintf(str, \"%lld\", min_total);\n\n     But note: the costList is of type long. But we are adding to a long long total. That is safe. We'll change the reading of x to long long? because x might be big. Actually, the first program reads x as a long. So we read:\n\n        long long x;\n        scanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &x);\n\n     Then the array arr: we read as long? But the problem says long. We use long long for arr? or long? Let me be consistent. We'll use long long for all large integers. Steps:\n\n        We change:\n          long long x;\n          long long *arr = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then costList: long long **costList = (long long**)malloc(...);\n\n        Then the min_total: long long. Then the conversion: sprintf(str, \"%lld\", min_total);\n\n     But note: the first program's k is an int (N is int) and k from 0 to N-1, so k*x: we do (long long)k * x. This is safe. We'll write the entire program with long long. Final code:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n However, note that the second Java program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads its own input from System.in.\n Since the instructions say that only the first block should read input and the last block should produce output,\n we must consider how to chain these two programs.\n\n But note: the first program (atcoder_AGC004_B) reads:\n   N and x (long) and then a list of N longs.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string.\n\n Since the output of the first program is a single long (the minimum value computed) and the second program expects a string,\n we cannot directly chain them by passing the long as a string? Actually, the second program expects a string of digits and possibly '?'.\n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How do we reconcile?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n We must design the C program as follows:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first Java program (which is integers N and x, and then N long numbers).\n   Step 2: Perform the computation of the first program (without printing the result to the screen, but storing it for the next step).\n   Step 3: Then, use the result of the first program (which is a single long) as the input for the second program.\n\n However, note that the second program in Java reads a string. So we must convert the long to a string? But the second program expects a string that may contain '?'. \n\n Actually, the second program is independent: it reads a string that is given as input. But the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n Therefore, we must convert the long output of the first program into a string and feed it to the second program.\n\n But wait: the two programs are from two different problems? They are not naturally chained? The problem statement says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n How to interpret?\n\n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the first program outputs a long. Then the second program must take that long as a string? However, the second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) is designed to solve a problem that expects a string of digits and '?'. \n\n But note: the first program's output is a long, which is a sequence of digits (no '?'). So the second program would read a string of digits.\n\n However, the second program's logic is about counting the number of ways to replace '?' in the string such that the resulting number mod 13 equals 5. But if there are no '?' in the input, then the string is fixed. Then the program would simply check if the fixed number mod 13 is 5? Actually, the program does:\n\n   if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... } else { ... }\n\n So if the input string has no '?', then it uses the fixed digit.\n\n Therefore, we can pass the long as a string without any '?'. Then the second program will compute the mod 13 of that fixed number? Actually, no: the second program does a DP from least significant digit? Let me check:\n\n   It processes the string from the last character to the first? Actually, it reverses the string by using index `cs.length - 1 - i`.\n\n   And base starts at 1 and then becomes (base * 10) % 13.\n\n   The DP state: dp[i][r] = number of ways for the suffix of length i+1 to form remainder r modulo 13.\n\n   But without any '?', the DP would only have one possibility per digit.\n\n   However, note: the second program expects a string that might be of any length. The long we output might be a very large number? We must convert it to a string without losing any digit.\n\n But note: the first program's output is the minimum value (a long). We have to output that long and then use it as a string for the second program.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we are to simulate the two programs in sequence.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read input for the first program (N, x, and the list of N longs).\n   Step 2: Compute the first program's result (the minimum value, a long).\n   Step 3: Convert that long to a string (without any extra characters, just the digits).\n   Step 4: Use that string as the input for the second program.\n\n   Then the second program will run on that string and compute the number of ways mod 1e9+7? But wait, the second program does not count ways when there are no '?'; it just does the deterministic computation.\n\n   Actually, the second program's output is the value of dp[dp.length-1][5], which for a fixed string without '?' will be 1 if the entire number mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise? Actually, no: the DP state accumulates the ways. Without any '?', there is exactly one way. So the result will be 1 if the number mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise.\n\n   However, that is not the behavior of the original chain? The original chain would run the first program and output a long, then the second program would read that long as a string and then output a number (either 0 or 1?).\n\n But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n However, note: the two programs are from two different problems. The problem does not state that they are from the same contest or that they are designed to work together. We are simply chaining two independent programs.\n\n Therefore, we must:\n\n   - Read the input for the first program (N, x, and the list of N longs).\n   - Compute the first program's result (min value, a long).\n   - Then use that long to form a string (without any '?') and pass it as the input to the second program.\n   - The second program will then run on that string and output a single integer (which is either 0 or 1?).\n\n But wait: the problem says the entire sequence. The original first program outputs a long and then the second program runs independently and outputs an integer.\n\n So the final output of the entire chain is the output of the second program.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we output the result of the second program.\n\n But note: the second program in the original code outputs dp[dp.length-1][5] mod MOD. And that value might be more than 1 if there are '?'? But in our case there are none. However, the problem does not specify that the second program's input must have '?'. It just runs on the string we give.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   We are going to write a C program that:\n\n   Part 1: Reads the input for the first program (N and x, and then N long integers).\n\n   Part 2: Computes the first program's result (min_value).\n\n   Part 3: Converts min_value to a string.\n\n   Part 4: Runs the second program's logic on that string (without any '?') and computes the answer.\n\n   Part 5: Outputs the answer (the result of the second program).\n\n However, note: the second Java program uses a DP that works on each character. We must simulate that in C.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We must combine both programs without I/O in the middle.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n\n        We read:\n          int N;\n          long x;\n          long *arr = (long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long));\n          for (int i=0; i<N; i++) scanf(\"%ld\", &arr[i]);\n\n     Step 2: Compute the first program's result.\n\n        The first program:\n\n          costList: a 2D array of Long with dimensions [N][N] (but in Java it's a list of arrays).\n\n          For each i (0-indexed) and castNum (from 0 to N-1):\n            costList[i][0] = arr[i]\n            for castNum from 1 to N-1:\n               costList[i][castNum] = min( costList[i][castNum-1], arr[(i - castNum + N) % N] )\n\n          Then for each k from 0 to N-1:\n            result[k] = k * x + sum_{i=0}^{N-1} costList[i][k]\n\n          Then the answer of the first program is min(result[k] for k in [0, N-1])\n\n        We note: k is the variable we called 'castNum' in the outer loop? Actually, in the result computation, we use k (which is from 0 to N-1) and for each k, we add k*x and then the sum of the k-th column of costList? Actually, the Java code:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n              final int j = i;   // This is wrong? Actually, the inner loop uses j as the column index? But wait:\n\n          result.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\n          Here, the outer loop is for i (which is the column index j? because j is set to i). Actually, the code is:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n              final int j = i;\n              result.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n          }\n\n          So for each j (from 0 to N-1) we compute: j*x + (sum_{i=0}^{N-1} costList[i][j])\n\n          Then we take the min of the result list.\n\n        Therefore, we need to compute for each k (which is the column, from 0 to N-1) the total cost = k*x + (sum over i of costList[i][k])\n\n        And then min_k (total cost)\n\n     Step 3: Convert the min_value (which is a long) to a string.\n\n        We have to be cautious: the long can be negative? The problem says x is long and the list of numbers are long. But note the first program uses Math.min and then adds nonnegative multiples (k from 0 to N-1, and x is given). The input constraints? We don't know, but we assume nonnegative? Actually, the problem doesn't specify. We'll do:\n\n          If min_value is 0, then we have the string \"0\".\n          Otherwise, we convert the long to a string.\n\n        However, note: the second program expects a string of digits. What if the number is negative? The second program's logic: it subtracts '0' from the character. That would break for '-'. So we must avoid negative numbers?\n\n        But let's see the first program: the costList[i][k] is the minimum over a circular subarray starting at i and going backwards k steps? and then we add k*x (which is nonnegative because k>=0 and x is given as a long, but x could be negative?).\n\n        The problem does not specify the sign of x. But note the input: x is read as nextLong(), so it can be negative.\n\n        Then the total cost = k*x + ... might be negative.\n\n        How does the second program handle negative? It doesn't. It expects a string of digits and possibly '?'. So if we have a negative number, we would have a string starting with '-'. Then the second program would try to process the minus sign as a non-digit? Actually, the code:\n\n          if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... } else {\n            int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';\n\n        This would break for the minus sign because '0' is 48, and '-' is 45. Then next = -3, which is not a digit.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider: the first program outputs a long that might be negative? But the problem says: the first program outputs a long. How is the negative represented? The problem does not say. But in the original chain, the first program prints the long using System.out.println, so it would print the negative sign. Then the second program would read that negative sign and break.\n\n        This implies that the problem expects nonnegative output? Or we must handle negative?\n\n        Alternatively, the problem constraints might ensure nonnegative. Without knowing, we must handle the conversion to string for negative numbers. However, the second program is not designed to handle negative numbers. So we must assume the output of the first program is nonnegative? Or the problem expects the second program to fail? That doesn't make sense.\n\n        Let me reexamine the first problem: atcoder_AGC004_B. Looking at the constraints in the problem? We don't have them. But in competitive programming, the constraints might be that all numbers are positive.\n\n        However, to be safe, we note: the second program is designed for a problem that expects a string of digits and '?'. Therefore, if the first program outputs a negative number, the chain breaks.\n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain would run the first program and output a negative number (with a minus sign) and then the second program would crash? because it would try to subtract '0' from the minus sign.\n\n        Actually, the second program would not crash, but it would compute with negative digits? That would break the logic.\n\n        Therefore, we must assume that the output of the first program is nonnegative? Or we must convert the absolute value? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must output the negative number as a string with a minus sign? But then the second program would not work as intended.\n\n        Alternatively, the two programs are independent and the problem does not state that the first program's output is nonnegative. So we are forced to output the negative number as a string with a minus sign. Then the second program would process the minus sign as a non-digit and skip the '?' branch? But then in the else branch, it would try:\n\n            int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';\n\n        and get -3 (for '-') which is not in 0..9, leading to an incorrect state.\n\n        Therefore, we must hope that the first program's output is nonnegative? Or we must adjust?\n\n        Given the ambiguity, and since the problem does not specify, we will assume that the first program's output is nonnegative. If it is negative, we will have to represent it as a string with a minus sign and then the second program will break. But that is the behavior of the original chain.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          char str[50]; // enough for a long\n          if (min_value < 0) {\n              sprintf(str, \"%ld\", min_value);\n          } else {\n              // positive\n              sprintf(str, \"%ld\", min_value);\n          }\n\n        But note: if min_value is 0, we get \"0\".\n\n     Step 4: Run the second program's DP on the string.\n\n        The second program:\n\n          MOD = 1000000007\n          dp[i][r] for i from 0 to len-1 (each digit) and r from 0 to 12.\n\n          We traverse the string from last character to first? Actually, the Java code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... }\n\n          So it processes the string from the last character to the first? Actually, the index is `cs.length - 1 - i` for the i-th iteration.\n\n          We can process the string in reverse order.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            long dp[len][13] = {0};   // but note: we don't know the length until we convert the long to string.\n\n            We must first compute the length of the string.\n\n            Let n = strlen(str).\n\n            Then we do:\n\n              base = 1\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  char c = str[n-1-i];   // the i-th character from the end.\n\n                  if (c == '?') {\n                     // but our string has no '?', so we skip this branch?\n                  } else {\n                     int next = c - '0';   // if c is a digit, then next is 0..9. But if there is a minus sign, then we get a negative? Actually, we are processing from the last character. The minus sign, if present, would be at the beginning? So when i is 0 to n-1, the last character is the last digit? and the first character (str[0]) is the first digit (or minus sign).\n\n                     Therefore, if the string has a minus sign, then when i = n-1, we would be at the first character which is '-'. Then we do next = '-' - '0' -> negative.\n\n                  }\n\n            So we must avoid negative numbers? Or the problem constraints guarantee nonnegative.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we assume the first program's output is nonnegative.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              char c = str[n-1-i];\n              if (c == '?') {\n                 // This won't happen in our case, but we can skip.\n                 // Actually, we don't have '?' so we only do the else branch.\n              } else {\n                 int digit = c - '0';\n                 for (int r = 0; r < 13; r++) {\n                     // We are going to update dp[i][ (digit * base + r) % 13 ] ?\n                     // Actually, the Java code:\n\n                     // for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n                     //   dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0));\n                     // }\n\n                 }\n              }\n              base = (base * 10) % 13;\n          }\n\n        However, note: the dp array in the Java code is dimensioned as [cs.length][13]. We must initialize:\n\n          For i=0 (the first iteration, which is the last digit of the string):\n\n            if the digit is d, then:\n\n              for pre in 0..12: \n                 new_r = (d * base + pre) % 13   -> but base at first is 1.\n\n                 Actually, the state: the current digit is d, and the state we are building is the entire number mod 13? The DP state for the suffix of the string.\n\n          The recurrence: \n\n            We are building the number from right to left.\n\n            Let F(i, r) = the number of ways for the suffix of length i (the last i digits) to form remainder r mod 13.\n\n            Then when we add a new digit d to the left of the suffix, the new number is: d * (10^(i)) + suffix_number.\n\n            Then the new remainder = (d * (10^i) + suffix_number) mod 13 = (d * base + suffix_number) mod 13.\n\n            But note: base = (10^i) mod 13.\n\n            Then the recurrence:\n\n              F(i, (d * base + r) % 13) += F(i-1, r)\n\n            However, the Java code does:\n\n              dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0));\n\n            For the first digit (i=0): \n\n              dp[0][ (base * next + pre) % 13 ] += (pre==0?1:0)\n\n            So for pre=0, we add 1 to state (base * next) % 13. For other pre, we add 0.\n\n            But note: the base for the first digit (the last in the string) is 1.\n\n            So the state for the first digit: we set state = (1*d) % 13? and then for pre=0 we add 1? so we have:\n\n                 dp[0][d % 13] = 1\n\n            Then for the next digit (i=1), base = (1 * 10) % 13 = 10.\n\n            Then for each state r that we have from the suffix (which is the state for the last digit) and for the new digit d, we do:\n\n                 new_state = (d * 10 + r) % 13\n\n            And then we accumulate.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          long dp[n][13];\n          // initialize dp to 0\n          int base = 1;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              for (int r = 0; r < 13; r++) {\n                  // We are going to update the next state for the next digit?\n                  // Actually, we need to clear the current row? or we can do a new row.\n\n                  // Instead, we can do:\n\n                  // We'll use a temporary array for the current row? or we can do a new dp array for the current row and then update.\n\n                  // Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  //   new_dp[r] = 0 for all r.\n\n                  // Then for each digit in the current position, we update.\n\n              }\n\n              char c = str[n-1-i];\n              int digit = c - '0';   // because we assume nonnegative and no non-digit.\n\n              // But we must check: what if the string has a minus? then we skip? Actually, we assume nonnegative.\n\n              for (int r_prev = 0; r_prev < 13; r_prev++) {\n                  long ways = 0;\n                  if (i == 0) {\n                      // for the first digit, the previous state: we only had r_prev=0 with ways=1? and the others 0.\n                      if (r_prev == 0) {\n                          ways = 1;\n                      } else {\n                          ways = 0;\n                      }\n                  } else {\n                      ways = dp[i-1][r_prev];   // the state from the previous (shorter suffix) for remainder r_prev.\n                  }\n\n                  // The new state: new_r = (digit * base + r_prev) % 13\n                  int new_r = (digit * base + r_prev) % 13;\n                  if (new_r < 0) new_r += 13;   // ensure nonnegative mod, but digit>=0, base>=0, r_prev>=0, so no need?\n                  new_r %= 13;   // already modded, but to be safe.\n\n                  dp[i][new_r] = (dp[i][new_r] + ways) % MOD;\n              }\n\n              base = (base * 10) % 13;\n          }\n\n        But note: the Java code updates the entire row at once. And the state for the current row is built by iterating over the previous state for all remainders.\n\n        However, the above loop does:\n\n          for each previous remainder r_prev, we compute the new remainder and add the ways.\n\n        But note: the Java code does:\n\n          for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n             dp[i][ (base * next + pre) % 13 ] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0));\n          }\n\n        So we are doing the same.\n\n        However, we must initialize the entire dp array to 0 at the beginning.\n\n        Then after processing all digits, the answer is dp[n-1][5] mod MOD.\n\n        But note: the Java code uses a 2D array of length [cs.length][13]. We are doing the same.\n\n     Step 5: Output dp[n-1][5] mod MOD.\n\n     However, note: the Java code does:\n\n        base = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n            ... \n            base = base * 10 % 13;\n        }\n\n        And the dp array is updated for each digit.\n\n     But note: the modulus: MOD = 1000000007.\n\n     We must do:\n\n        #define MOD 1000000007\n\n     And use long for the dp array? because the numbers can be large.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We are going to:\n\n     Read the first program's input.\n\n     Allocate an array for the list of numbers.\n\n     Precompute the costList: we need a 2D array of size [N][N].\n\n        long **costList = (long**)malloc(N * sizeof(long*));\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n            costList[i] = (long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long));\n        }\n\n        Then for each i (0 to N-1):\n            costList[i][0] = arr[i];\n            for (int k=1; k<N; k++) {\n                long prev = costList[i][k-1];\n                long candidate = arr[(i - k + N) % N];\n                costList[i][k] = (prev < candidate) ? prev : candidate;\n            }\n        }\n\n     Then we compute for each k from 0 to N-1:\n\n        long total_cost = (long)k * x;   // note: k is an integer, and x is long.\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n            total_cost += costList[i][k];\n        }\n\n        Then we compare to find the minimum total_cost over k.\n\n     Then we convert min_value (which is the minimum total_cost) to a string.\n\n     Then we run the second program's DP on that string.\n\n     Then output the result (dp[n-1][5] % MOD).\n\n     But note: the second program's base is updated as base = base * 10 % 13; and we do mod 13 for base.\n\n     However, we must note: the base in the second program is the power of 10 mod 13 at the current digit (from the right). This is correct.\n\n     Also, the dp array for the second program: we are using the entire string (including the minus sign? if present). We assume nonnegative.\n\n     We'll assume the min_value is nonnegative.\n\n     Steps for the second program:\n\n        n = strlen(str);\n        long dp[n][13];   // This is a variable-length array, which is supported in C99.\n\n        // Initialize the entire dp array to 0.\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                dp[i][r] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        int base = 1;\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            char c = str[n-1-i];\n            int digit = c - '0';   // safe if c is a digit.\n\n            // For the previous state: if i==0, then we consider the base state: only remainder 0 has count 1.\n            for (int r_prev = 0; r_prev < 13; r_prev++) {\n                long ways;\n                if (i == 0) {\n                    if (r_prev == 0) {\n                        ways = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        ways = 0;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    ways = dp[i-1][r_prev];\n                }\n\n                // If we are at the first row (i==0), then we don't have a previous row? Actually, we are building the first row by using the base state (r_prev=0) only.\n\n                int new_r = (digit * base + r_prev) % 13;\n                new_r = (new_r + 13) % 13;   // to ensure nonnegative.\n\n                dp[i][new_r] = (dp[i][new_r] + ways) % MOD;\n            }\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13;\n        }\n\n        Then the answer is dp[n-1][5] % MOD.\n\n     However, note: the Java code does the same? But the Java code updates the entire row for the current digit by iterating over the previous state.\n\n     But note: the above loop for the second program does not consider the possibility of multiple digits? Actually, we are only using one digit (the fixed one). And we are iterating over the previous remainders.\n\n     But we must note: the state transition: for each previous remainder, we compute the new remainder and add the ways.\n\n     This is the same as the Java code.\n\n     However, the Java code does not initialize the entire dp array to zero at the beginning? It only initializes the current row by accumulating from the previous row? Actually, in Java, the dp array is created and then updated. We are doing the same: we set to zero initially and then update.\n\n     But note: the base state (i=0) is handled by the condition: if (i==0) we use the base state (only r_prev=0 has count 1). Then we update the first row.\n\n     Then for the next row, we use the first row as the previous.\n\n     This is the same.\n\n     However, we must note: the modulus for the base: base = (base * 10) % 13; -> that is correct.\n\n     Finally, we output dp[n-1][5] mod MOD.\n\n     But note: the dp array we built is for the entire string. The last row (i = n-1) is the state after processing the entire string? And we want the remainder 5.\n\n     Therefore, we output dp[n-1][5].\n\n     However, the Java code does: dp[dp.length-1][5] -> which is the last row and the 5-th column.\n\n     But note: in our dp, the row index i: \n        i=0: last digit\n        i=1: the next to last, ... \n        i=n-1: the first digit (if we are processing from last to first).\n\n     So the entire string is processed in the last row? Yes.\n\n     Therefore, the answer is dp[n-1][5].\n\n     But note: the dp array we built: the row index i corresponds to the i-th digit from the end. So after processing the entire string (n digits) we have the state at row n-1.\n\n     So we output dp[n-1][5].\n\n     However, we must note: the base state is at i=-1? and we are using i from 0 to n-1.\n\n     So the above code is correct.\n\n     But note: the state transition for the first row (i=0) is:\n\n        We have a digit d0 (the last digit) and we do:\n\n          new_r = (d0 * 1 + 0) % 13 = d0 % 13.\n\n        Then we set dp[0][d0%13] += 1.\n\n     Then for the next row (i=1): we have digit d1 (the next to last) and base = 10 mod 13.\n\n        For each previous remainder r_prev (which is d0%13, and only that state has count 1), we do:\n\n          new_r = (d1 * 10 + d0) % 13.\n\n        Then set dp[1][new_r] = 1.\n\n     Then for the next digit, etc.\n\n     This is building the number mod 13.\n\n     Then at the end, we get the entire number mod 13 at row n-1.\n\n     But the problem asks for mod 5? Actually, the second program outputs dp[dp.length-1][5] (the state 5). So we want the count of ways that the entire number mod 13 is 5? But in our case, there is exactly one way? So if the entire number mod 13 is 5, then we get 1; else 0.\n\n     But the second program was designed to count the ways when there are '?'. In our case, there are none, so we get either 0 or 1.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the original chain would output 1 when the min_value mod 13 is 5, then we do the same.\n\n     But wait: the second program in the original chain, when run independently, would output the number of ways? So if we run it on a fixed string, it outputs 1 if the number mod 13 is 5? Actually, no: the number mod 13 is fixed. The second program counts the number of ways that the fixed string (without any '?') leads to mod 5? Actually, there is exactly one way (the fixed string) and it either is 5 mod 13 or not. So the output is 1 if the number mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise.\n\n     But the problem says: the entire chain. The first program outputs a number. Then we run the second program on that number as a string. So the entire chain outputs 1 if the first program's output mod 13 is 5, and 0 otherwise.\n\n     However, that is not the intended behavior of the first program? But the problem says to chain the two programs.\n\n     So we do as above.\n\n     But note: the first program's output might be huge? The min_value might be a very big long. The conversion to string: we use a buffer of size 50, which is safe for long (max 20 digits).\n\n     Also, the dp array for the second program: the length n is at most 20, so we can do a 20x13 array.\n\n     Steps in C:\n\n        Step 1: Read N and x, then the list of N longs.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the costList (a 2D array of N x N).\n\n        Step 3: For k from 0 to N-1:\n\n                  total = k * x;\n                  for i=0 to N-1:\n                      total += costList[i][k];\n\n                  if total is the minimum so far, remember it.\n\n        Step 4: Convert the minimum total to a string.\n\n        Step 5: Run the second program's DP on the string.\n\n        Step 6: Print the result (dp[n-1][5] % MOD).\n\n     However, note: the second program uses modulo 1000000007. We do the mod in the dp array.\n\n     Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n     We must free the memory? But the program ends.\n\n     We assume N is at least 1.\n\n     Let me code accordingly.\n\n     Important: the first program's k: the Java code uses k (which is the column) from 0 to N-1. Then the total for k is computed.\n\n     Then we take the min over k.\n\n     We'll do:\n\n        long min_total = LLONG_MAX;   // from limits.h\n        for (int k=0; k<N; k++) {\n            long total = (long)k * x;\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                total += costList[i][k];\n            }\n            if (total < min_total) {\n                min_total = total;\n            }\n        }\n\n     Then convert min_total to a string.\n\n     But note: the min_total might be negative? We'll use:\n\n        char str[50];\n        sprintf(str, \"%ld\", min_total);\n\n        However, if min_total is negative, we get a minus sign. Then the second program will break. We assume nonnegative.\n\n     Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (min_total < 0) {\n            // We cannot handle negative in the second program? Then we must do what?\n            // The problem says \"behaves identically\", so we output the same as the original chain.\n\n            // The original chain: the first program outputs the negative number as a string with a minus sign, then the second program would break? and output 0? because it would not assign any state? Actually, the second program would process the minus sign as a non-digit and then in the else branch, subtract '0' and get negative? Then in the state computation: (digit * base + r_prev) where digit is negative? Then mod 13 might be negative? and then we assign to dp[i][negative]? which is out of bounds.\n\n            // We must avoid negative indices? In our C code, we do:\n\n                int new_r = (digit * base + r_prev) % 13;\n\n            If digit is negative, then new_r might be negative. Then we do:\n\n                new_r = (new_r + 13) % 13;   // This will make it in [0,12].\n\n            But then the state is defined. However, the second program in Java would also compute the mod correctly? The mod operator in Java for negative: (-1) % 13 is -1? Then the index would be negative? and cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\n            So the original chain would crash? Then we must also crash? But we are in C, and we are using modulo arithmetic that adjusts to nonnegative. And we index from 0 to 12. So we are safe? But the Java program would crash.\n\n            Therefore, we must not have negative digits? We assume nonnegative.\n\n        }\n\n     Given the complexity, we assume the problem constraints ensure nonnegative.\n\n     Let me write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n     We include necessary headers.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <limits.h>\n\n        #define MOD 1000000007\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read input for the first program.\n            int N;\n            long x;\n            scanf(\"%d %ld\", &N, &x);\n            long *arr = (long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long));\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%ld\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: Allocate costList (N x N)\n            long **costList = (long**)malloc(N * sizeof(long*));\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                costList[i] = (long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long));\n            }\n\n            // Build costList\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                costList[i][0] = arr[i];\n                for (int k=1; k<N; k++) {\n                    long prev = costList[i][k-1];\n                    long candidate = arr[(i - k + N) % N];   // because (i-k) might be negative.\n                    costList[i][k] = (prev < candidate) ? prev : candidate;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step 3: Compute the total for each k and find the min.\n            long min_total = LLONG_MAX;\n            for (int k=0; k<N; k++) {\n                long total = k * x;   // k is int, x is long -> long multiplication.\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    total += costList[i][k];\n                }\n                if (total < min_total) {\n                    min_total = total;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Free the costList and arr?

We'll skip the entire DP and set the result to 0.\n                    // However, we are at the first character? the minus sign is at the beginning, so when i = n-1, we get the first character which is '-'. \n                    // Then we break out of the DP? and then at the end we output 0.\n                    // But we must break the entire DP? and then skip the rest.\n\n                    // We'll set the entire dp for this row to 0? and then break the loop?

We do:\n\n        base = (base * 10) % 13;\n\n     But we can do:\n\n        base = (base * 10) % 13;\n        if (base < 0) base += 13;   // but base is always nonnegative? because 10 mod 13 is 10, and then 10*10=100 mod13=9, etc.\n\n     Actually, the multiplication of nonnegative numbers mod 13 is nonnegative.\n\n     Therefore, we are safe.\n\n     However, the above code for the second program's DP does not handle the case when the string is \"0\"? \n\n        For \"0\": n=1, then i=0: \n            c = '0'\n            digit=0.\n            for r_prev=0: ways = 1 (because i==0 and r_prev==0).\n            new_r = (0*1+0) %13 = 0.\n            dp[0][0] = 1.\n\n            Then base becomes 10 mod13.\n\n        Then we output dp[0][5]? which is 0.\n\n        So the result is 0? but the entire number 0 mod13 is 0, not 5.\n\n        So we output 0, which is correct.\n\n     Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n     But note: the dp array for the second program: the state at the last row (n-1) is the state for the entire string.\n\n     We are using the entire string.\n\n     We'll run the entire C program.\n\n     However, note: the second program in Java uses base in the modulus 13? and we do the same.\n\n     We'll test with a small example? But we cannot run now.\n\n     We output the code as required.\n\n     Note: the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" So we only read at the beginning and print at the end.\n\n     We have done so.\n\n     Let me write the entire C code.\n\n     But note: we must free the memory? We free costList and arr, but if we return early because of negative, we must free? \n\n     We'll restructure: if we see a minus sign, we free the allocated memory? But we are about to exit. The OS will free.\n\n     Alternatively, we can do the free after the DP? But if we break in the middle, we don't free? It's acceptable for a small program.\n\n     We'll write the code as follows.\n\n     Important: We must use long long for the dp array in the second program if the numbers are big? Actually, the dp array holds counts that can be up to 10^(n) mod MOD? but MOD is 1e9+7, and n is at most 20? Then the maximum count is 10^20? which is huge? But we are doing mod 1e9+7 at every step? So we are safe.\n\n     But note: we are using long in C. On many systems, long is 64 bits, which can hold up to 1e9+7 * 2? Actually, mod 1e9+7, the maximum value is 1e9+6, so we can use long? But to be safe, we use long long for the dp array? because the sum might be large.\n\n     Actually, the mod is 1e9+7, and the maximum value in a state is less than 1e9+7? so we can use long? but to avoid overflow in the addition, we do mod at every addition.\n\n     But the multiplication: (dp[i][new_r] + ways) might be up to 2e9? which is within long (if long is 4 bytes, then 2e9 is the limit) -> risk.\n\n     We'll use long long for the dp array.\n\n     Change:\n\n        long long dp[n][13];\n\n        and then:\n\n        dp[i][new_r] = (dp[i][new_r] + ways) % MOD;\n\n        and initialize to 0.\n\n     And the ways: long long ways.\n\n     Also, the state for the first row: we use 1, which is int. But we assign to long long.\n\n     So we change:\n\n        long long dp[n][13];\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                dp[i][r] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        ...\n\n        long long ways;\n\n     And then:\n\n        if (i==0) {\n            if (r_prev==0) ways = 1;\n            else ways = 0;\n        } else {\n            ways = dp[i-1][r_prev];\n        }\n\n     Then:\n\n        dp[i][new_r] = (dp[i][new_r] + ways) % MOD;\n\n     This is safe.\n\n     We'll write the final code accordingly.\n\n     Also, the min_total might be very big? but we are converting to string with %ld -> if long is 64 bits, it's safe.\n\n     We assume long is 64 bits? The problem says the first program uses long.\n\n     In C, long may be 32 bits? But the problem says the numbers are long. We use %ld for reading and writing.\n\n     But to be safe for large numbers, we use:\n\n        long long min_total = LLONG_MAX;   // but note: we are storing min_total in a long? Actually, we used long for min_total.\n\n     We used:\n\n        long min_total = LLONG_MAX;\n\n     But if the total is beyond long? But the input constraints? We don't know. We'll use long for the first program as in the Java.\n\n     The Java program uses long. In Java, long is 64 bits.\n\n     In C, long may be 32 bits? On Windows, long is 32 bits? We use long long for the first program's total? But the problem says long.\n\n     To be safe, we use long long for the total_cost and min_total.\n\n     Change:\n\n        long long min_total = LLONG_MAX;\n        for (int k=0; k<N; k++) {\n            long long total = (long long)k * x;\n            for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                total += costList[i][k];\n            }\n            if (total < min_total) {\n                min_total = total;\n            }\n        }\n\n     And then convert:\n\n        char str[50];\n        sprintf(str, \"%lld\", min_total);\n\n     But note: the costList is of type long. But we are adding to a long long total. That is safe.\n\n     We'll change the reading of x to long long? because x might be big.\n\n     Actually, the first program reads x as a long. So we read:\n\n        long long x;\n        scanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &x);\n\n     Then the array arr: we read as long? But the problem says long. We use long long for arr? or long? Let me be consistent.\n\n     We'll use long long for all large integers.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        We change:\n          long long x;\n          long long *arr = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n\n        Then costList: long long **costList = (long long**)malloc(...);\n\n        Then the min_total: long long.\n\n        Then the conversion: sprintf(str, \"%lld\", min_total);\n\n     But note: the first program's k is an int (N is int) and k from 0 to N-1, so k*x: we do (long long)k * x.\n\n     This is safe.\n\n     We'll write the entire program with long long.\n\n     Final code:"
