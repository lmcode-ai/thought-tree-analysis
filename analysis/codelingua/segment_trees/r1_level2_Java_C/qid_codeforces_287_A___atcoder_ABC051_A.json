It just reads tokens. But the input is given as 4 lines, each containing a string of 4 characters without spaces. So we can read 4 lines. However, to be safe, we read 4 tokens. But if the tokens are separated by newline, that's the same. We can do:\n\n        char grid[4][5];  // 4 rows, each string of 4 characters plus null terminator. for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%s\", grid[i]);\n        }\n\n  Then we have a flag `int found = 0;`\n\n  Then:\n\n        for (int u = 0; u < 3; u++) {   // because we are going to u+1, so u from 0 to 2 (inclusive)\n            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n                if ( (grid[u][i] == grid[u][i+1] && (grid[u+1][i] == grid[u][i] || grid[u+1][i+1] == grid[u][i]) ) || (grid[u+1][i] == grid[u+1][i+1] && (grid[u][i] == grid[u+1][i] || grid[u][i+1] == grid[u+1][i])) ) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (found) break;\n        }\n\n        if (found) {\n            printf(\"YES\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n        } But wait: the condition in the second part of the OR uses `grid[u+1][i]` and `grid[u+1][i+1]` and then compares with `grid[u][i]` and `grid[u][i+1]`. However, note that the condition in the second part is:\n\n        (str[u+1].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i+1) [so D: grid[u+1][i] == grid[u+1][i+1]]\n        and then (E || F): \n            E: str[u].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i)   -> grid[u][i] == grid[u+1][i]\n            F: str[u].charAt(i+1) == str[u+1].charAt(i)   -> grid[u][i+1] == grid[u+1][i]\n\n  But note: the F condition in the original Java code was:\n\n        str[u].charAt(i+1) == str[u+1].charAt(i)\n\n  However, that is: the character at (u, i+1) is compared with (u+1, i). That seems asymmetric? But that is what the code says.",

Condition2:\n              D: true. E: row u[0]=='b' ! = 'a' -> false. F: row u[1]=='a' == row u+1[0]=='a' -> true -> condition2 true.

Condition2:\n              D: true (a==a)\n              E: b==a? false, F: b==a? false -> condition2 false. So that matches. Therefore, the C code:\n\n  Steps:\n    1.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_287_A):\n  - Reads 4 strings (each of length 4? because the inner loop goes to index 2 and checks i+1, so each string must have at least 3 characters? Actually, the input is 4 strings, and each string has 4 characters as per the problem context, but the code doesn't enforce that. However, the inner loops run from 0 to 2, so we assume each string has at least 4 characters? Actually, the problem is about a 4x4 grid. So each string is 4 characters long.\n\n  - The program checks for a 2x2 subgrid that has at least 3 same characters (forming a square that is not all different). Specifically, it checks for:\n      In the current row u and next row u+1, and columns i and i+1:\n        Either:\n          (a) The two adjacent in row u are the same, and at least one of the two below in row u+1 (at column i or i+1) is the same as that character.\n        Or:\n          (b) The two adjacent in row u+1 are the same, and at least one of the two above in row u (at column i or i+1) is the same.\n\n  - If it finds such a square, it prints \"YES\" and breaks. Otherwise, after checking all possible 2x2 squares (rows 0 to 2, columns 0 to 2), it prints \"NO\".\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC051_A):\n  - Reads a single line and replaces every comma with a space, then prints the string.\n\nHowever, note the sequence: the output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nBut observe the first program only outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Then the second program would read that single line and replace commas with spaces. Since \"YES\" or \"NO\" have no commas, the second program would just output the same string.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n  Input to first program: 4 strings (each of 4 characters) in 4 lines? Actually, the first program reads 4 tokens (each token is a string). The input example for the first program would be:\n\n      ##..\n      .##.\n      .##.\n      ....\n\n  Then the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without quotes, and without any extra spaces, and then a newline?).\n\n  Then the second program reads that output as its input. The second program replaces commas by spaces. Since the input string has no commas, it outputs the same string.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain: \n  Input: 4 lines of 4 characters each (each line is a string of 4 chars).\n  Output: either the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without quotes) and then a newline? Actually, the second program uses `println`? The second Java program uses `System.out.println(sb)`. The first program also uses `println`.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs either:\n  \"YES\" (then a newline) and exits, or \"NO\" (then a newline) and exits.\n\nThen the second program reads that entire line (which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and replaces commas. Since there are none, it outputs the same string and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? Because the second program doesn't change the output.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs \"YES\\n\" and the second program reads that as \"YES\" (without the newline? because `readLine` in Java would read without the newline? Actually, `readLine` in Java does not include the newline. Then the second program outputs \"YES\" (without the newline) and then appends a newline? because `println` adds a newline.\n\nSo the output of the chain is:\n  \"YES\\n\" or \"NO\\n\"\n\nWhich is the same as the first program? So why the second program? Actually, the second program is applied to the output of the first. But since the first output is without commas, the second doesn't change it. However, the second program does output the string with a newline. The first program also outputs with a newline.\n\nBut note: the first program breaks as soon as it finds a square. The second program is independent.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the entire sequence of programs. We are to write a single C program that does the same.\n\nBut wait: the input to the chain is the input to the first program (4 lines of 4 characters). The output of the chain is the output of the second program, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (with a newline) - same as the first.\n\nSo we could just run the first program and then pass the output to the second program? But in a single C program, we avoid I/O in the middle.\n\nPlan:\n  Step 1: Read the input (4 strings, each of 4 characters? but the problem doesn't specify the length, but the code uses 4 tokens and then loops over 4 characters per string? Actually, the first program reads 4 tokens (each token is a string). The input tokens are split by whitespace? The first program uses `sc.next()`, which reads tokens (so if the input is 4 lines, each line has one token of 4 characters). But note: the input might be given as:\n\n        ##..\n        .##.\n        .##.\n        ....\n\n      Each on a separate line? Then `sc.next()` would read each line as one token? Because the next() method reads until whitespace. And each line has no space? So we get 4 tokens.\n\n  Step 2: Process the grid as in the first program to determine if we should output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n  Step 3: Then we would normally pass that string to the second program. But the second program just replaces commas by spaces. Since the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have no commas, we can just output the same.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? So we can just write the first program in C and output the result? But wait, what if the first program outputs a string that has commas? It doesn't. So the second program is a no-op.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must consider the possibility that the output of the first might be arbitrary? But in this specific case, it's only \"YES\" or \"NO\". Therefore, the second program would output the same.\n\nSo the C program will:\n\n  1. Read 4 strings (each of 4 characters? we assume 4 tokens, each of 4 characters, but the problem doesn't specify the length, but the grid is 4x4 so we assume 4 characters per string).\n\n  2. Check the grid for a 2x2 square that satisfies the condition.\n\n  3. Output either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (with a newline).\n\nBut note: the second program in Java would output the same as the first, so we don't need to do anything extra.\n\nHowever, what if the first program outputs something else? It doesn't.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs \"YES\" without a newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println` so it appends a newline. The second program reads the entire line (so it gets \"YES\" without the newline) and then outputs \"YES\" and then a newline. So the final output has a newline.\n\nIn our C program, we will output the same: either \"YES\\n\" or \"NO\\n\".\n\nBut the first program might break early? Yes, and we do the same.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  - Read 4 strings (each of length at least 4? we assume 4, but we can use fixed size arrays).\n\n  - We have a grid of 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\n  - Check for u from 0 to 2 (rows) and i from 0 to 2 (columns) for a 2x2 block.\n\n  - Condition: \n        if ( (str[u][i] == str[u][i+1] && (str[u+1][i] == str[u][i] || str[u+1][i+1] == str[u][i])) \n            OR\n        ( (str[u+1][i] == str[u+1][i+1] && (str[u][i] == str[u+1][i] || str[u][i+1] == str[u+1][i])) )\n\n  - If found, set a flag and break both loops.\n\n  - Then output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nBut note: the condition in the first Java program is written as:\n\n        if ((str[u].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i + 1)\n                && (str[u + 1].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i)\n                        || str[u + 1].charAt(i + 1) == str[u].charAt(i)))\n            || (str[u + 1].charAt(i) == str[u + 1].charAt(i + 1)\n                && (str[u].charAt(i) == str[u + 1].charAt(i)\n                        || str[u].charAt(i + 1) == str[u + 1].charAt(i)))) \n\n  However, note the parentheses: the condition is:\n\n        ( condition1 ) || ( condition2 )\n\n  where condition1 is:\n        (A && (B || C))\n  and condition2 is:\n        (D && (E || F))\n\n  But actually, the condition1 is:\n\n        ( (str[u][i] == str[u][i+1]) && ( (str[u+1][i] == str[u][i]) || (str[u+1][i+1] == str[u][i]) ) )\n\n  and condition2 is:\n\n        ( (str[u+1][i] == str[u+1][i+1]) && ( (str[u][i] == str[u+1][i]) || (str[u][i+1] == str[u+1][i]) ) )\n\nSo we can write that.\n\nImplementation in C:\n\n  We'll read 4 strings. We can use `scanf` to read 4 tokens? or `fgets` for each line? The problem says: the input is 4 lines? Actually, the first program uses `sc.next()` which doesn't care about lines? It just reads tokens. But the input is given as 4 lines, each containing a string of 4 characters without spaces. So we can read 4 lines.\n\n  However, to be safe, we read 4 tokens. But if the tokens are separated by newline, that's the same.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        char grid[4][5];  // 4 rows, each string of 4 characters plus null terminator.\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%s\", grid[i]);\n        }\n\n  Then we have a flag `int found = 0;`\n\n  Then:\n\n        for (int u = 0; u < 3; u++) {   // because we are going to u+1, so u from 0 to 2 (inclusive)\n            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n                if ( (grid[u][i] == grid[u][i+1] && (grid[u+1][i] == grid[u][i] || grid[u+1][i+1] == grid[u][i]) )\n                     || (grid[u+1][i] == grid[u+1][i+1] && (grid[u][i] == grid[u+1][i] || grid[u][i+1] == grid[u+1][i])) ) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (found) break;\n        }\n\n        if (found) {\n            printf(\"YES\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n        }\n\nBut wait: the condition in the second part of the OR uses `grid[u+1][i]` and `grid[u+1][i+1]` and then compares with `grid[u][i]` and `grid[u][i+1]`. However, note that the condition in the second part is:\n\n        (str[u+1].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i+1)   [so D: grid[u+1][i] == grid[u+1][i+1]]\n        and then (E || F): \n            E: str[u].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i)   -> grid[u][i] == grid[u+1][i]\n            F: str[u].charAt(i+1) == str[u+1].charAt(i)   -> grid[u][i+1] == grid[u+1][i]\n\n  But note: the F condition in the original Java code was:\n\n        str[u].charAt(i+1) == str[u+1].charAt(i)\n\n  However, that is: the character at (u, i+1) is compared with (u+1, i). That seems asymmetric? \n\n  But that is what the code says.\n\n  Alternatively, the condition might be intended to be:\n\n        condition2: the two adjacent in the bottom row (u+1) are the same, and then at least one of the two above (in row u) is the same as the bottom left? (or bottom right? but it uses the bottom left for both comparisons?).\n\n  Specifically, it uses the bottom left character (at u+1, i) for both comparisons? \n\n        E: (u, i) == (u+1, i)\n        F: (u, i+1) == (u+1, i)\n\n  But note: the bottom row has the same character at (u+1, i) and (u+1, i+1). So if either of the top row at the same column (i) or next column (i+1) equals the bottom left (at u+1,i), then the condition holds.\n\n  But that is what the code says.\n\n  However, let's test with an example:\n\n      Example 1: \n          Row u:   \"aa\"\n          Row u+1: \"aa\"\n\n          Then condition1: \n              A: row u: a==a -> true.\n              B: row u+1[0] = a == row u[0] (a) -> true -> condition1 true.\n\n          Example 2:\n          Row u:   \"ab\"\n          Row u+1: \"aa\"\n\n          Condition1: \n              A: row u: 'a'=='b'? false -> condition1 false.\n          Condition2:\n              D: row u+1: 'a'=='a' -> true.\n              E: row u[0]=='a' and row u+1[0]=='a' -> true -> condition2 true.\n\n          Example 3:\n          Row u:   \"ba\"\n          Row u+1: \"aa\"\n\n          Condition1: \n              A: row u: 'b'=='a' -> false.\n          Condition2:\n              D: true.\n              E: row u[0]=='b' != 'a' -> false.\n              F: row u[1]=='a' == row u+1[0]=='a' -> true -> condition2 true.\n\n          Example 4:\n          Row u:   \"bb\"\n          Row u+1: \"aa\"\n\n          Condition1: \n              A: true (b==b)\n              B: b==a? false, C: b==a? false -> condition1 false.\n          Condition2:\n              D: true (a==a)\n              E: b==a? false, F: b==a? false -> condition2 false.\n\n  So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the C code:\n\n  Steps:\n    1. Read 4 strings (each of 5 characters including null terminator).\n    2. Check for the condition in a 2x2 block for u in [0,2] and i in [0,2].\n    3. Output accordingly.\n\nBut note: the original first program breaks as soon as it finds one. So we break early.\n\nHowever, what if the grid is not 4x4? The problem states it is. So we assume.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nBut wait: the second program is applied to the output. Since the output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and the second program just replaces commas (and there are none) and then outputs, we can simply output the same.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is just the first program.\n\nBut note: the problem says to translate the entire sequence. So we must consider the possibility of arbitrary output from the first program? However, in this specific case, the first program only outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\". And the second program does nothing. So we can just run the first program and output the same.\n\nSo the C program is as described.\n\nLet's write the C code accordingly."
