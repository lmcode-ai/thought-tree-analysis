Then in the second program, we compute sum(1)+sum(0). But the original Java function sum_digits:\n\n        public static int sum(int a) {\n            int ans = 0;\n            while (a >= 10) {\n                ans += a % 10;\n                a /= 10;\n            }\n            ans += a;\n            return ans;\n        }\n\n   For a=0: the while loop condition fails, then ans += a -> 0. So it's safe. However, note: the Java program does:\n\n        int n = 0; if (N % 2 == 0) {\n            n = N / 2;\n        } else {\n            n = (N + 1) / 2;\n        } Then, the loop: for (int A = 1; A <= n; A++)\n\n   But note: when N=0? Then n = 0? Then the loop runs from A=1 to 0? -> doesn't run. Then ans = sum(1)+sum(-1)? But the input N is ura, which is nonnegative? Because ura is the count of exact matches, so it is >=0. But what if ura==0? Then N=0. Then in the second program: \n        ans = sum(1) + sum(0-1) = sum(1) + sum(-1)\n\n   How does our sum_digits handle negative? The Java program: for negative, the modulo and division might be negative? But the original problem atcoder_AGC025_A: \"Split a number N into two nonnegative integers A and B such that A+B=N\". So the original problem assumes N>=1? The problem says: \"N is an integer between 1 and 10^50000\" (or something? Actually, the sample: N=15). But in our chain, N is ura, which is between 0 and the length of s. However, the original second program (atcoder_AGC025_A) expects N>=1?",

But in our chain, ura can be 0? Then we must consider: the second program is designed for N>=1? How does the second program behave for N=0? In the second program:\n\n        int N = stdIn.nextInt();   // if 0\n        int n = (N % 2==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2;   // n=0\n        int ans = sum(1) + sum(N-1);   // = sum(1) + sum(-1) The function sum(-1): \n        while (a>=10) -> false, then ans += a -> -1. So ans = 1 + (-1) = 0. Then the loop does not run.\n\n        System.out.println(0); So it outputs 0. Our function sum_digits(-1) would be:\n\n        while (a>=10) -> false, then ans += a -> -1. So 1 + (-1) = 0. Then we output 0. But the problem atcoder_AGC025_A expects N>=1? But the problem says: between 1 and 10^5? However, in our chain, we are using ura which can be 0. So we must handle. Since the original second program (if run independently) would read N=0 and output 0, then we do the same. Therefore, our program is safe. Let me test with a small example. Example for the first program:\n\n        s = \"a\"\n        t = \"A\"\n\n        Then:\n          First pass: \n             s[0] = 'a', which is not in t? because t has 'A'. So tmap['a']=0 -> skip. Then, ura=0. Second pass: \n             i=0: not used. rch = reverse_char('a') = 'A'\n             tmap['A']=1 -> so use: opa=1. Then ura=0, opa=1. Then we set N=ura=0. Then the second program: \n            n = 0 (since 0%2==0 -> n=0)\n            ans = sum(1)+sum(-1)= 1 + (-1)=0.\n\n        Output 0. But the original first program would output \"0 1\", and then the second program would read 0 and output 0? So the chain outputs 0. Therefore, our program is correct. However, note: the second program in the chain only reads the first integer? So we are setting N=ura. So we output the result of the second program: the minimum digit sum for splitting N (which is ura) into two numbers.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one C program.\n\n The first Java program (codeforces_518_B) does:\n   - Reads two strings: s (as a StringBuilder) and t.\n   - Counts the frequency of each character in t.\n   - Then, it goes through s and for each character that is in t (exact case), it removes one occurrence from t and marks that position in s as '\u042f' (and counts as ura).\n   - Then, it goes through s again (now some positions are marked) and for each remaining character, it checks the reverse case (if uppercase then lowercase, and vice versa) in t. If found, removes one occurrence and counts as opa.\n   - Outputs: ura and opa.\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_AGC025_A) does:\n   - Reads an integer N.\n   - Defines a function sum(a) that calculates the sum of digits of a number.\n   - Then, it sets n = ceil(N/2) (if N is even, n=N/2; else n=(N+1)/2).\n   - It then iterates A from 1 to n, and for each A, it calculates sum(A) + sum(N-A) and finds the minimum of these values.\n   - Outputs the minimum.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is two numbers (ura and opa) and the second program reads an integer.\n\n How are they connected?\n The problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n But the first program outputs two integers (ura and opa) on the same line, and the second program reads one integer (N). \n\n This implies that the output of the first program is used as input to the second program? But the second program expects one integer.\n\n Actually, looking at the original chain: the first program outputs two numbers, then the second program is run and reads an integer. This does not match.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Since the first program outputs two integers (say, \"a b\"), the second program would then read the next token as an integer. But the second program only reads one integer. \n\n How the chain is intended? The problem does not specify the input to the first program. But we are to reproduce the entire sequence.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So, the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. The output of the chain is the output of the last program.\n\n However, the two programs are independent? They are two separate programs that are run in sequence. The input to the chain is the input for the first program. The output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n\n But the first program outputs two integers and the second program expects one integer. How do we reconcile?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n We must consider the entire data flow.\n\n Since the first program outputs two integers (say, ura and opa) and then the second program is run with that output as its input, the second program would read the first integer (ura) and ignore the rest? Or the output of the first program is \"ura opa\" and then the second program reads the next integer from stdin? But then the second program would read the first integer (ura) as N? \n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This could be done by piping:\n\n   java codeforces_518_B | java atcoder_AGC025_A\n\n In that case, the second program would read from the standard input which is the output of the first program. The first program outputs two integers (say, \"10 20\\n\"). The second program then reads the first integer (10) and the rest of the output (20) would be left unread? But the second program only reads one integer.\n\n So the second program would use the first integer (ura) as N? \n\n But note: the second program does not read the entire input? It reads one integer and then stops reading. So the second integer (opa) would be ignored.\n\n Therefore, the chain would be:\n\n   Input to the first program: two strings (s and t)\n   Output of the first program: two integers (ura and opa) -> becomes input to the second program as one integer (ura) and the opa is ignored.\n\n Then the second program computes the answer for the number N = ura.\n\n But wait: the second program expects an integer N, and then it computes the minimum digit sum for splitting N into two nonnegative integers A and N-A.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must mimic the behavior of the chain.\n\n Therefore, the entire C program will:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program: two strings (s and t). We assume the input format is the same: one string for s and then one string for t.\n\n   Step 2: Process the first program's logic to compute ura and opa.\n\n   Step 3: Then, use the value of ura as the input N for the second program.\n\n   Step 4: Run the second program's logic on N = ura.\n\n   Step 5: Output the result of the second program.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\", and the output of the chain is the output of the last program. So we output the answer from the second program.\n\n But wait: what if the second program was intended to use the entire output of the first? The problem does not specify. However, the second program only reads one integer. So we use ura.\n\n Alternatively, we might have misunderstood the chain: the problem says two programs are run in sequence. The first program outputs two integers. The second program then runs and reads from the same stdin? But that would be the original input? That doesn't make sense.\n\n The typical way of chaining is via pipes: the standard output of the first becomes the standard input of the second.\n\n Therefore, we design:\n\n   Read the two strings (s and t) from stdin.\n\n   Compute ura and opa as in the first program.\n\n   Then, set N = ura.\n\n   Then, run the second program's logic (digit sum splitting) on N.\n\n   Output the result.\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain does not see the original input? It only sees the output of the first. So we don't have the original input for the second program? We are going to use ura.\n\n So the C program structure:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <ctype.h>\n\n   // Function for the first program: reverse case\n   char reverse_char(char ch) {\n       if (islower(ch)) {\n           return toupper(ch);\n       } else {\n           return tolower(ch);\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Function for the second program: sum of digits\n   int sum_digits(int a) {\n       int ans = 0;\n       while (a >= 10) {\n           ans += a % 10;\n           a /= 10;\n       }\n       ans += a;\n       return ans;\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       // Step 1: Read the two strings s and t (from the first program's input)\n       char s[200001]; // We need to choose a safe size. The problem doesn't specify, but let's assume 200000.\n       char t[200001];\n       scanf(\"%s\", s);\n       scanf(\"%s\", t);\n\n       // We are going to simulate the first program's logic.\n\n       // Build frequency map for t: using an array for ASCII (0-127) should be enough.\n       int tmap[128] = {0}; // Index by the character (as integer). We'll use the character's ASCII value.\n\n       int tlen = strlen(t);\n       for (int i = 0; i < tlen; i++) {\n           tmap[(int)t[i]]++;\n       }\n\n       int ura = 0;\n       int opa = 0;\n       int slen = strlen(s);\n\n       // First pass: exact matches\n       for (int i = 0; i < slen; i++) {\n           char ch = s[i];\n           if (tmap[(int)ch] > 0) {\n               tmap[(int)ch]--;\n               ura++;\n               // We mark s[i] as used? In the Java code, they set it to '\u042f'. But in C we don't have StringBuilder, so we can use an array to mark? \n               // Actually, we don't need to physically mark the string because we are going to do a second pass that ignores exact matches? \n               // But note: in the Java code, the second pass uses the original string but with some positions replaced by '\u042f'. The second pass skips those because they are replaced? Actually, no: the second pass checks the original character? \n               // Actually, in the first pass, the Java program replaces the character in the StringBuilder with '\u042f'. Then in the second pass, it checks the character at that position: if it's '\u042f', then it's skipped? Because the reverse of '\u042f' (which is a Cyrillic letter) is not going to be in the tmap (which is built from t, which is given as a string of letters?).\n\n               // However, note: the problem does not specify the character set. The Java program uses '\u042f' (a non-ASCII character) to mark. But in our C program, we don't have the same representation? \n\n               // Instead, we can do: we mark the position by setting s[i] to 0? But that would break the string. Alternatively, we can have an array to mark which positions are already used.\n\n               // Let's do: we create an array `used` of booleans for each index in s, initially false.\n               // We'll mark the ones that are exact matches as used, and then in the second pass we skip used positions.\n\n               // But note: the Java program does not skip by index but by the character being replaced. However, the second pass in Java still iterates over every index, but if the character is replaced by '\u042f', then when we call reverse('\u042f') we get a lowercase '\u044f'? and that is unlikely to be in the tmap? \n\n               // Actually, the Java program sets the character to '\u042f' and then in the second pass, for that index, it will try to use the character '\u042f' and reverse it. But the reverse of '\u042f' is '\u044f' (if we consider toLowerCase). But the original t string is in English? The problem does not specify.\n\n               // Since the problem says the same behavior, we must avoid using the same character twice. So we have two options:\n\n               // Option 1: remove the character from the string so it's not used again? We can set s[i] to a non-printable character? But we don't know what's in t.\n\n               // Option 2: use a separate array to mark used positions. Then in the second pass, we skip positions that were used in the first pass.\n\n               // We'll go with Option 2: because the Java program effectively removes the character by replacing it with a special character, so we can simulate by marking the position as used.\n\n               // We'll create an array `used` of length slen, initialize to 0 (false). Then when we use an exact match, mark used[i]=1.\n\n               // However, note: the Java program does two passes: the first pass replaces the character and then the second pass checks the new character (which is '\u042f') at that index. But then the second pass would not use that index because the reverse of '\u042f' is not in the map? \n\n               // But to be safe, we will mark the position as used in the first pass and skip it in the second pass? Actually, the Java program does not skip the index, it just changes the character. So in the second pass, the character at that index is now '\u042f' and we check its reverse. But if we don't mark it, then we would try to use the same index again? \n\n               // However, the Java program does not remove the index from the iteration. It iterates over every index twice. But in the first pass, we set the character to '\u042f', and in the second pass, we use the character at that index (which is now '\u042f') to get the reverse. \n\n               // How do we simulate without a StringBuilder? We can do:\n\n               //   We have the original s in an array. We'll create a copy for the first pass? Not necessary.\n\n               // Actually, we can do:\n\n               //   In the first pass, we are going to remove the exact matches. Then in the second pass, we use the same string s, but we skip the positions that were used in the first pass? \n\n               // But the Java program does not skip the positions in the second pass. It uses every position, but the ones that were changed to '\u042f' become unavailable because the reverse of '\u042f' is not present in the map? \n\n               // However, the problem does not specify the character set of t. What if t contains the character '\u044f'? Then the second pass might use a position that was an exact match? \n\n               // Actually, the first pass sets the character to '\u042f' (which is Cyrillic capital 'Ya') and then the second pass calls reverse on that, which would give the lowercase '\u044f'. If the original t had the character '\u044f', then that could be used? \n\n               // But note: the first pass removes the exact characters from t. The second pass uses the reverse of the current character in s. For the positions that were exact matches, the current character is '\u042f', so we look for the reverse of '\u042f' which is '\u044f'. If there was a '\u044f' in the original t, then it might be present? \n\n               // However, the original t is given as a string of English letters? The problem does not specify. But the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", so we must do the same: we change the character at that position to '\u042f'. But in C, we are using an array of characters. We can do that.\n\n               // But note: the Java program uses a StringBuilder and modifies the character. We can do the same: we modify the s array. However, we have to be cautious: we are going to modify the string s.\n\n               // Since we are going to do a second pass that uses the same array s, we can change the character at the exact match position to a special character. We choose the same character: '\u042f'. But in C, we can use a multibyte character? Or we can use an ASCII-safe representation? \n\n               // Alternatively, note: the problem does not specify the character set of s and t. The first program uses '\u042f' to mark, which is a character outside the ASCII range. So in the second pass, when we call reverse_char on '\u042f', we get '\u044f'. If the original t does not contain '\u044f', then we are safe. \n\n               // But we don't know. So we do:\n\n               //   We change the character at the exact match position to a non-ASCII character (specifically, the Cyrillic capital '\u042f'). But in C, we can represent it by its Unicode code point? But that is complicated.\n\n               // Alternatively, we can avoid changing the string and instead use a used[] array and then in the second pass, we skip the used positions? That would be equivalent: because in the Java program, the second pass would get the character '\u042f' and then try to match its reverse. But if we skip the used positions, then we don't use that character again. \n\n               // But note: the Java program does not skip the position. It tries to use every position. However, the character at that position has been changed to '\u042f', and if the reverse of '\u042f' is not in the map, then it doesn't use it. So skipping the used positions would be equivalent? \n\n               // Actually, skipping the used positions in the second pass would avoid the same index being used twice, which is what we want. And it is simpler.\n\n               // So we'll create an array `used` of booleans for the length of s.\n\n               // But we didn't plan for that initially. We'll have to allocate it.\n\n               // However, we are going to do two passes. We can do:\n\n               //   First, we create an array `used` (size slen) and initialize to 0.\n\n               //   Then, in the first pass, when we find an exact match, we mark used[i]=1 and then also update the frequency map and increment ura.\n\n               //   Then, in the second pass, we skip if used[i] is true. Otherwise, we take the character s[i] and get its reverse, and check in the frequency map.\n\n               // This is equivalent to the Java program? \n\n               // In the Java program, the second pass iterates over every index, but for the ones that were exact matches, the character is now '\u042f'. We skip by used[i] so we don't process those. But what if a character was not used in the first pass and the character is '\u042f'? Then we would skip? We don't want that. \n\n               // Alternatively, we can not skip by index, but by the fact that the character was changed? That is not straightforward.\n\n               // Let me re-think: The Java program does:\n\n               //   First pass: for each index i, if the character s[i] is in the map (and count>0), then it removes one, sets the character to '\u042f', and marks ura++.\n\n               //   Second pass: for the same index i, it looks at the current character (which might be the original or '\u042f'). For the ones that were changed to '\u042f', the reverse_char('\u042f') returns '\u044f'. Then it checks if '\u044f' is in the map. If yes, then it uses it and marks opa++. \n\n               // But in our approach with a used[] array, we are skipping the exact matches in the second pass. That is different: because the Java program does not skip the index, it just replaces the character. \n\n               // However, the Java program does not prevent the same character from being used twice? The same index is processed in both passes? But the first pass changes the character so the second pass sees a different character? \n\n               // How can we simulate without modifying the string? We can do:\n\n               //   In the second pass, we use the original character? But then what about the positions that were exact matches? We don't want to use them again. \n\n               // Actually, the problem is: we want to use each character in s only once. The Java program uses each index twice? But it changes the character in the first pass so that the second pass sees a different character? \n\n               // However, the second pass is intended to use the same index? But the problem says: each character in s is used at most once. \n\n               // Therefore, we should not use the same index twice. So we can mark the index as used in the first pass and skip in the second.\n\n               // So we do:\n\n               //   We create an array `used` of length slen, initialized to 0.\n\n               //   First pass: for i from 0 to slen-1:\n               //        if tmap[s[i]] > 0, then:\n               //            tmap[s[i]]--\n               //            ura++\n               //            used[i] = 1\n\n               //   Second pass: for i from 0 to slen-1:\n               //        if used[i] is 0, then:\n               //            char r = reverse_char(s[i]);\n               //            if tmap[r] > 0, then:\n               //                tmap[r]--\n               //                opa++\n               //                used[i] = 1   [optional, but not needed since we are not going to use again]\n\n               // This avoids using the same index twice. And it is equivalent to the Java program? \n\n               // In the Java program, the first pass changes the character to '\u042f'. Then in the second pass, it uses the same index but the character is now '\u042f'. We are skipping that index so we use the original character? \n\n               // Actually, we are using the original character at that index in the second pass? But the Java program uses the new character (which is '\u042f') in the second pass. \n\n               // This discrepancy: \n\n               //   In the Java program, if a position was an exact match, then in the second pass it becomes a '\u042f'. But we skip that position in the second pass. \n\n               //   But what if a position was not an exact match in the first pass, and then in the second pass, the character at that position is the original one? Then we use the reverse of the original? \n\n               //   That is what we want.\n\n               //   However, in the Java program, the second pass uses the modified string. But the modification only happens to the exact matches. For non-exact matches, the character remains the original. \n\n               //   Therefore, we can do without modifying the string: we just skip the indices that were used in the first pass.\n\n               //   But note: what if the first pass doesn't use a position, then the second pass uses the same index? Then we are using the original character. That is the same as the Java program.\n\n               //   And for the positions that were used in the first pass, we skip in the second pass. In the Java program, the second pass would see '\u042f'. But we skip. However, if we skip, we avoid using that index again. That is the same as the Java program? \n\n               //   Actually, in the Java program, the second pass does see the index but the character is now '\u042f'. We are avoiding that index. But if we skip, then we are not processing that index at all. \n\n               //   However, the Java program processes the index and if the reverse of '\u042f' is available, it would use it. But we are skipping the index. \n\n               //   But note: the first pass used that index already (for an exact match). We don't want to use the same index again. The problem is: each character in s is used at most once. \n\n               //   So we should skip the index entirely in the second pass.\n\n               //   Therefore, we can use the `used` array to mark any index that has been used (either in the first or second pass) and then skip. But note: the Java program uses an index at most once? \n\n               //   Actually, the Java program uses each index only once: in the first pass, if it is used, then it changes the character so that the second pass doesn't use it? Not exactly: the second pass still runs over the index, but the changed character might not be available? \n\n               //   But the problem says: we want to use each character in s to match one character in t. So we should use each index only once.\n\n               //   Therefore, the `used` array approach is valid.\n\n               //   However, the Java program does not skip the index in the second pass for the ones that were used in the first pass. It runs the second pass on every index. But then, for the ones that were changed to '\u042f', it might use it again? \n\n               //   That would be a bug? Because then one index would be used twice? \n\n               //   Actually, the Java program does not mark the index as used again? It simply changes the character. The second pass then checks the character at that index (which is now '\u042f') and if the reverse of '\u042f' is available, it uses it and then marks the same index as used again? \n\n               //   But that would be using one position twice? \n\n               //   Looking at the code: the first pass sets the character to '\u042f'. Then the second pass runs and for that index, it takes the character '\u042f' and then calls reverse('\u042f') -> '\u044f'. Then it checks if '\u044f' is in the map. If it is, then it removes one occurrence and counts opa. Then it sets the character again? But the StringBuilder has setCharAt, but it's the same index? \n\n               //   The problem says: each character in s is used to match one character in t. So the same index should not be used twice.\n\n               //   This suggests that the Java program has a flaw? \n\n               //   Actually, the problem (codeforces 518_B) is about matching the message s with the newspaper t. They are two strings. The matching is:\n\n               //      First, match as many as possible with the same case (exact case). Then, for the remaining, match with the opposite case.\n\n               //   And each character in t can be used only once.\n\n               //   So the same index in s is only matched once. The Java program does two passes: the first pass matches the exact case and then the second pass matches the opposite case. But the same index is processed in both passes? \n\n               //   That is the flaw: an index that is matched in the first pass should not be considered in the second pass.\n\n               //   How the Java program avoids using the same index twice? It does not. It changes the character to '\u042f' so that in the second pass, the reverse of '\u042f' is unlikely to be in the map? But if the map has the character '\u044f', then it would use the same index twice.\n\n               //   This is a known issue? \n\n               //   Actually, the problem says: the newspaper t contains only Latin letters? Then '\u042f' and '\u044f' are not Latin. So it is safe.\n\n               //   Therefore, we can do: we mark the exact matches and then skip them in the second pass. That is safe and avoids the potential flaw.\n\n               //   So we will use a used array.\n\n               //   We'll create an array `used` of size slen, and set to 0.\n\n               //   Then, first pass: for i in 0..slen-1:\n               //        if tmap[s[i]] > 0, then:\n               //            tmap[s[i]]--\n               //            ura++\n               //            used[i] = 1\n\n               //   Second pass: for i in 0..slen-1:\n               //        if used[i] is 0, then:\n               //            char r = reverse_char(s[i]);\n               //            if tmap[r] > 0, then:\n               //                tmap[r]--\n               //                opa++\n               //                used[i] = 1   // mark as used to avoid reuse? but we are skipping by used[i] so not necessary to mark again? but we are going to skip in the next iterations anyway? and we don't use the same index again.\n\n               //   But note: we don't mark the second pass as used in the `used` array? Actually, we don't need to because we are iterating and we skip the ones that were used in the first pass. The second pass doesn't mark the index as used? But we don't need to because we are only going to use each index once.\n\n               //   Actually, we don't need to mark the second pass in the `used` array? Because we are iterating and we skip the ones that are already used (from the first pass). The second pass uses an index only once and then we move on.\n\n               //   However, if we don't mark, then if we do a third pass? No, we don't. So we don't need to mark for the second pass? But we are not going to use that index again. \n\n               //   But we can mark it to be safe? It doesn't hurt.\n\n               //   We'll mark it.\n\n               //   Alternatively, we can avoid the `used` array by having two separate arrays? But we'll use one `used` array.\n\n               //   We'll allocate the `used` array.\n\n               //   However, note: the problem says the strings can be up to 200000? So we can allocate an array of 200000 booleans? That's 200000 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\n               //   But note: we are reading the strings from stdin, and we don't know the exact length? We used slen = strlen(s). So we can allocate:\n\n               //        int *used = (int *)calloc(slen, sizeof(int));   // or we can use a VLA if the length is known.\n\n               //   But we have slen already.\n\n               //   Let's do:\n\n               //        int used[slen];   // VLA, but if slen is big, it might be on the stack? 200000*sizeof(int)=800KB, which might be too big for stack.\n\n               //   Alternatively, we can use dynamic allocation? Or we can use a static size? We assumed the string up to 200000, so we can declare:\n\n               //        #define MAX 200000\n               //        char s[MAX+1], t[MAX+1];\n               //        int used[MAX];\n\n               //   Then we know the maximum length.\n\n               //   We'll do that.\n\n           }\n       }\n\n       But wait: we haven't allocated the used array? We are going to do:\n\n          int used[200000] = {0};   // but we don't know the exact length? Actually, we have slen. But we can make it of size MAX.\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < slen; i++) {\n              used[i] = 0;\n          }\n\n       However, we can initialize to 0 by:\n\n          int used[200000] = {0};   // but note: if slen is less than 200000, we only use the first slen.\n\n       But we defined MAX 200000. We can:\n\n          #define MAX_LEN 200000\n\n       Then:\n\n          char s[MAX_LEN+1];\n          char t[MAX_LEN+1];\n          int used[MAX_LEN] = {0};\n\n       Then we read the strings and set:\n\n          scanf(\"%s %s\", s, t);\n          int slen = strlen(s);\n          int tlen = strlen(t);\n\n       And then we do the first pass and second pass.\n\n       But note: we must not use the entire MAX_LEN for the used array? We only need up to slen. But we allocated MAX_LEN, which is enough.\n\n       Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          int *used = (int*)calloc(slen, sizeof(int));\n\n       But then we have to free? It's a short program, so we can let it be.\n\n       However, we choose the fixed size for safety.\n\n       But the problem says the string lengths? The problem doesn't specify, but the Java program uses StringBuilder and String. We assume 200000.\n\n       We'll do:\n\n          #define MAX 200000\n\n       and then declare:\n\n          char s[MAX+1], t[MAX+1];\n          int used[MAX] = {0};\n\n       Then:\n\n          scanf(\"%s %s\", s, t);\n          slen = strlen(s);\n          tlen = strlen(t);\n\n       And then the first pass and second pass as described.\n\n       But note: we are modifying the frequency map for the second pass? Yes, the second pass uses the updated map.\n\n       So:\n\n          // Step 1: Build frequency map for t.\n\n          // Step 2: First pass: exact matches -> update used, update map, update ura.\n\n          // Step 3: Second pass: for indices not used, check the reverse -> update map, update opa, and mark used.\n\n       Then we have ura and opa.\n\n       Then, we set N = ura. (because the second program in the chain will read the first integer from the output of the first program, which is ura)\n\n       Then, we run the second program's logic on N.\n\n          // The second program: atcoder_AGC025_A\n\n          // We have a function: int sum_digits(int a) as defined.\n\n          // Then:\n          int n_val;\n          if (N % 2 == 0) {\n              n_val = N / 2;\n          } else {\n              n_val = (N + 1) / 2;\n          }\n\n          int ans = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N - 1);\n          for (int A = 1; A <= n_val; A++) {\n              int temp = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A);\n              if (temp < ans) {\n                  ans = temp;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Then output ans.\n\n       But note: the original second program (atcoder_AGC025_A) does:\n\n          int n = ...;   // n_val in our code.\n\n          // Then it starts the ans as sum(1)+sum(N-1). Then iterates A from 1 to n.\n\n          // We do the same.\n\n       Finally, we print the answer.\n\n       However, note: the original chain: the first program outputs ura and opa, and then the second program reads ura? But we are setting N=ura. And then we output the ans.\n\n       Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n          #include <ctype.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n\n          #define MAX_LEN 200000\n\n          char reverse_char(char ch) {\n              if (islower(ch)) {\n                  return toupper(ch);\n              } else {\n                  return tolower(ch);\n              }\n          }\n\n          int sum_digits(int a) {\n              int ans = 0;\n              while (a >= 10) {\n                  ans += a % 10;\n                  a /= 10;\n              }\n              ans += a;\n              return ans;\n          }\n\n          int main() {\n              char s[MAX_LEN+1];\n              char t[MAX_LEN+1];\n              int used[MAX_LEN] = {0};   // initialize to 0\n\n              scanf(\"%s\", s);\n              scanf(\"%s\", t);\n\n              int tmap[128] = {0};   // frequency map for t: for ASCII 0 to 127.\n\n              int slen = strlen(s);\n              int tlen = strlen(t);\n\n              // Build frequency map for t\n              for (int i = 0; i < tlen; i++) {\n                  tmap[(int)t[i]]++;\n              }\n\n              int ura = 0;\n              int opa = 0;\n\n              // First pass: exact matches\n              for (int i = 0; i < slen; i++) {\n                  char ch = s[i];\n                  if (tmap[(int)ch] > 0) {\n                      tmap[(int)ch]--;\n                      ura++;\n                      used[i] = 1;\n                  }\n              }\n\n              // Second pass: case-insensitive matches (reverse case) for the unused indices\n              for (int i = 0; i < slen; i++) {\n                  if (used[i]) continue;   // skip if already used in the first pass\n\n                  char rch = reverse_char(s[i]);\n                  if (tmap[(int)rch] > 0) {\n                      tmap[(int)rch]--;\n                      opa++;\n                      used[i] = 1;   // mark as used, though not necessary for further passes, but for consistency.\n                  }\n              }\n\n              // Now, we have ura and opa. The next program in the chain uses the first integer (ura) as input.\n\n              int N = ura;   // because the second program reads the first integer from the output of the first, which is ura.\n\n              // Now run the second program's logic on N.\n\n              int n_val;\n              if (N % 2 == 0) {\n                  n_val = N / 2;\n              } else {\n                  n_val = (N + 1) / 2;\n              }\n\n              // The original second program starts by setting ans = sum(1) + sum(N-1)\n              int ans = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1);\n              for (int A = 1; A <= n_val; A++) {\n                  int temp = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A);\n                  if (temp < ans) {\n                      ans = temp;\n                  }\n              }\n\n              // Output the answer for the second program.\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n   But note: what if N==1? Then in the second program, we compute sum(1)+sum(0). But the original Java function sum_digits:\n\n        public static int sum(int a) {\n            int ans = 0;\n            while (a >= 10) {\n                ans += a % 10;\n                a /= 10;\n            }\n            ans += a;\n            return ans;\n        }\n\n   For a=0: the while loop condition fails, then ans += a -> 0.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   However, note: the Java program does:\n\n        int n = 0;\n        if (N % 2 == 0) {\n            n = N / 2;\n        } else {\n            n = (N + 1) / 2;\n        }\n\n   Then, the loop: for (int A = 1; A <= n; A++)\n\n   But note: when N=0? Then n = 0? Then the loop runs from A=1 to 0? -> doesn't run.\n\n   Then ans = sum(1)+sum(-1)? \n\n   But the input N is ura, which is nonnegative? Because ura is the count of exact matches, so it is >=0.\n\n   But what if ura==0? Then N=0.\n\n   Then in the second program: \n        ans = sum(1) + sum(0-1) = sum(1) + sum(-1)\n\n   How does our sum_digits handle negative? \n\n   The Java program: for negative, the modulo and division might be negative? \n\n   But the original problem atcoder_AGC025_A: \"Split a number N into two nonnegative integers A and B such that A+B=N\". So the original problem assumes N>=1? \n\n   The problem says: \"N is an integer between 1 and 10^50000\" (or something? Actually, the sample: N=15). \n\n   But in our chain, N is ura, which is between 0 and the length of s. \n\n   However, the original second program (atcoder_AGC025_A) expects N>=1? \n\n   Actually, the problem atcoder_AGC025_A says: \"You are given an integer N between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)\".\n\n   But in our chain, ura can be 0? \n\n   Then we must consider: the second program is designed for N>=1? \n\n   How does the second program behave for N=0? \n\n   In the second program:\n\n        int N = stdIn.nextInt();   // if 0\n        int n = (N % 2==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2;   // n=0\n        int ans = sum(1) + sum(N-1);   // = sum(1) + sum(-1)\n\n   The function sum(-1): \n        while (a>=10) -> false, then ans += a -> -1.\n\n        So ans = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\n   Then the loop does not run.\n\n        System.out.println(0);\n\n   So it outputs 0.\n\n   Our function sum_digits(-1) would be:\n\n        while (a>=10) -> false, then ans += a -> -1.\n\n        So 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\n   Then we output 0.\n\n   But the problem atcoder_AGC025_A expects N>=1? But the problem says: between 1 and 10^5? \n\n   However, in our chain, we are using ura which can be 0. So we must handle.\n\n   Since the original second program (if run independently) would read N=0 and output 0, then we do the same.\n\n   Therefore, our program is safe.\n\n   Let me test with a small example.\n\n   Example for the first program:\n\n        s = \"a\"\n        t = \"A\"\n\n        Then:\n          First pass: \n             s[0] = 'a', which is not in t? because t has 'A'. So tmap['a']=0 -> skip.\n          Then, ura=0.\n\n          Second pass: \n             i=0: not used. \n             rch = reverse_char('a') = 'A'\n             tmap['A']=1 -> so use: opa=1.\n\n          Then ura=0, opa=1.\n\n        Then we set N=ura=0.\n\n        Then the second program: \n            n = 0 (since 0%2==0 -> n=0)\n            ans = sum(1)+sum(-1)= 1 + (-1)=0.\n\n        Output 0.\n\n   But the original first program would output \"0 1\", and then the second program would read 0 and output 0? \n\n   So the chain outputs 0.\n\n   Therefore, our program is correct.\n\n   However, note: the second program in the chain only reads the first integer? So we are setting N=ura.\n\n   So we output the result of the second program: the minimum digit sum for splitting N (which is ura) into two numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n   Note: We must be cautious about the size of the frequency map: we use 128 for ASCII. But the problem says the strings are of letters? We assume they are ASCII letters.\n\n   But the reverse_char function: we use islower and toupper/tolower from ctype.h. These are defined for ASCII.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We note: the strings s and t can be up to 200000 characters, so we use MAX_LEN=200000.\n\n   We also note: the second program's loop: from 1 to n_val. n_val is about N/2. And N is at most 200000? So the loop would run 100000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the original second program in Java: the input N is up to 10^5? So the loop runs 50000 times? Actually, the problem says: N between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). So our N=ura is at most the length of s, which is 200000. Then n_val=100000, so the loop runs 100000 times. That is acceptable in C.\n\n   Therefore, the final code:"
