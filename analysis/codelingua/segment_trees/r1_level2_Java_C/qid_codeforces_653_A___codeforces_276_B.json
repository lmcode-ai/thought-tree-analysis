Actually: \n            if oddCount==0 -> 0<=1 -> true -> \"First\"\n            if oddCount==1 -> true -> \"First\"\n            if oddCount>=2: then we check oddCount%2: \n                if oddCount is odd (like 3,5,...) -> true -> \"First\"\n                if even (like 2,4,...) -> false -> \"Second\"\n\n        So: \n            oddCount=0 -> First\n            oddCount=1 -> First\n            oddCount=2 -> Second\n            oddCount=3 -> First\n            oddCount=4 -> Second\n\n        Therefore: it's the same as: if (oddCount % 2 == 0 && oddCount > 1) then Second, else First. Alternatively, we can write: if (oddCount % 2 == 0 && oddCount > 1) \n                printf(\"Second\\n\");\n            else\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n\n        But the condition in the original code is:\n\n            if (oddCount < = 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> First\n            else\n                -> Second So we can write that condition directly. Let me test with the examples:\n\n        For \"YES\": oddCount=3 -> condition: 3<=1? false -> 3%2 ! =0 -> true -> First (correct). For \"NO\": oddCount=2 -> condition: 2<=1? false -> 2%2==0 -> false -> Second (correct). So we can use the same condition.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into a single C program.\n The first program (codeforces_653_A) does:\n   - Reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers.\n   - Removes duplicates, sorts the list.\n   - Checks if there exists at least one triplet of consecutive numbers (like x, x+1, x+2).\n   - Prints \"YES\" if such triplet exists, else \"NO\".\n\n The second program (codeforces_276_B) does:\n   - Reads a string.\n   - Counts the frequency of each character.\n   - Counts the number of characters that have an odd frequency (oddCount).\n   - If oddCount is 0, 1, or odd (i.e., oddCount % 2 != 0, meaning oddCount is odd) then it prints \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is used as the input to the second program.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program expects a string (which it reads entirely).\n\n How the chain works:\n   Input for the entire chain: \n      The input for the first program is an integer `n` and then `n` integers.\n\n   Then the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". This output becomes the input to the second program.\n\n   The second program then reads that string (which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and then processes it.\n\n However, note the second program's behavior:\n   It counts the frequency of each character and then the oddCount.\n\n   For the string \"YES\": \n        Y:1, E:1, S:1 -> all odd -> oddCount = 3.\n        Then: if oddCount<=1 OR oddCount%2 !=0 -> \n            oddCount=3: 3<=1? false -> 3%2 !=0 -> true -> prints \"First\".\n\n   For the string \"NO\":\n        N:1, O:1 -> oddCount=2.\n        Then: 2<=1? false -> 2%2==0 -> false -> prints \"Second\".\n\n So the entire chain:\n   Input: the integers for the first program.\n   Then:\n        If the first program outputs \"YES\", then the second program outputs \"First\".\n        If the first program outputs \"NO\", then the second program outputs \"Second\".\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the integers and do the first program's processing to determine a boolean (found).\n   Step 2: Instead of printing, we convert the boolean to a string: either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and then pass that string to the second program's logic.\n\n   But note: the second program is designed to read a string and then count the odd frequency counts.\n\n   However, we can simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n   Part 1:\n      Read n, then n integers.\n      Remove duplicates: we can use sorting and then remove duplicates.\n      Then check for consecutive triplet.\n\n   Part 2:\n      Instead of reading from stdin again, we use the string that we would have output from part1: either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n      Then we run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n   Then output the result of the second program.\n\n   However, note: the original chain uses the output of the first as input to the second. So the entire input to the chain is only the first program's input.\n\n   How to structure:\n\n      - Read the first integer n, then n integers (from stdin).\n      - Process to get a boolean found (if there is a consecutive triplet of three numbers in the sorted distinct array).\n      - Then, let s = (found ? \"YES\" : \"NO\"). This is the intermediate string.\n\n      - Now, process the string s with the second program's logic:\n          Count frequency of each char in s.\n          Count the number of chars that have odd frequency (oddCount).\n          Then, if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> output \"First\"\n                  else -> output \"Second\"\n\n   But note: the second program in the original chain would read the entire next line. In our case, the intermediate string is exactly one line (without any extra newline?).\n\n   However, the first program outputs a string without any extra spaces and then a newline. The second program reads the entire line? Let me see:\n\n        In Java: bufferedReader.readLine() -> reads a line (so it includes the entire string without the newline? Actually, it reads the line without the newline).\n\n        But note: the first program uses PrintWriter.println which appends a newline. However, the second program's readLine() discards the newline.\n\n        So the string that the second program gets is without the newline.\n\n        Therefore, in our simulation, we are using the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without a newline) for the second part.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the n integers.\n        Step 2: Process to get the intermediate string s (without newline, because we are going to simulate the string that the second program reads).\n\n        Step 3: For the string s, count the frequency of each character.\n\n        Step 4: Then compute oddCount (number of characters that appear an odd number of times).\n\n        Step 5: Then if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) then output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\n   However, note: the second program outputs a newline (using println). So we should output a newline as well.\n\n   But note: the first program's output is exactly the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" plus a newline? Then the second program reads the line without the newline. So the string that the second program processes is without the newline. So we don't include the newline in our string for the second part.\n\n   Therefore, we use the string without the newline.\n\n   Example:\n\n        Input to the entire chain:\n            6\n            1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n        First program: \n            reads n=6, then the numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6]. \n            distinct and sorted -> [1,2,3,4,5,6] (no duplicates). \n            It will find triplet (1,2,3) -> found=true -> output \"YES\\n\"\n\n        Then the second program reads the string from stdin: it gets \"YES\" (without the newline) because readLine() removes the newline.\n\n        Then the second program processes \"YES\": \n            Y:1, E:1, S:1 -> all odd -> oddCount=3 -> then condition: 3<=1? false -> 3%2 !=0 -> true -> outputs \"First\\n\"\n\n   So in our C program:\n\n        We read:\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int arr[n];\n            for (i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\n        Then we process the array to remove duplicates and sort. We can:\n            - sort the array\n            - remove duplicates (and then we have a new size)\n\n        Then we traverse the sorted distinct array to check for consecutive triplet.\n\n        Then set s to \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without newline).\n\n        Then for the string s, we count frequency.\n\n        Then compute oddCount.\n\n        Then if (oddCount<=1 || oddCount%2 !=0) -> printf(\"First\\n\")\n               else -> printf(\"Second\\n\")\n\n   Important: The entire chain output is the output of the second program.\n\n   But note: the first program might be run with different inputs. We have to simulate the entire chain.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the array.\n\n        Step 2: Sort and remove duplicates.\n\n            We can do:\n                qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n                Then remove duplicates: traverse and copy unique elements.\n\n            Let unique[] and unique_size.\n\n        Step 3: Check for consecutive triplet:\n\n            for (i=0; i <= unique_size-3; i++) {\n                if (unique[i] + 1 == unique[i+1] && unique[i+1] + 1 == unique[i+2]) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Step 4: Set s to:\n\n            char *s = found ? \"YES\" : \"NO\";\n\n        Step 5: Now, for the string s, we count frequency.\n\n            int freq[256] = {0}; // for ASCII\n\n            for (i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n                freq[(unsigned char)s[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            int oddCount = 0;\n            for (i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                    oddCount++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Step 6: Check condition:\n\n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"Second\\n\");\n            }\n\n   However, note: the condition in the second program was:\n\n        if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n            -> then \"First\"\n        else \n            -> \"Second\"\n\n   This condition is equivalent to: \n        if (oddCount % 2 == 1) then \"First\", else \"Second\"?\n        But note: it also says if oddCount<=1 then \"First\". \n\n        Actually: \n            if oddCount==0 -> 0<=1 -> true -> \"First\"\n            if oddCount==1 -> true -> \"First\"\n            if oddCount>=2: then we check oddCount%2: \n                if oddCount is odd (like 3,5,...) -> true -> \"First\"\n                if even (like 2,4,...) -> false -> \"Second\"\n\n        So: \n            oddCount=0 -> First\n            oddCount=1 -> First\n            oddCount=2 -> Second\n            oddCount=3 -> First\n            oddCount=4 -> Second\n\n        Therefore: it's the same as: \n            if (oddCount % 2 == 0 && oddCount > 1) then Second, else First.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: \n            if (oddCount % 2 == 0 && oddCount > 1) \n                printf(\"Second\\n\");\n            else\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n\n        But the condition in the original code is:\n\n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n                -> First\n            else\n                -> Second\n\n        So we can write that condition directly.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n        For \"YES\": oddCount=3 -> condition: 3<=1? false -> 3%2 !=0 -> true -> First (correct).\n\n        For \"NO\": oddCount=2 -> condition: 2<=1? false -> 2%2==0 -> false -> Second (correct).\n\n   So we can use the same condition.\n\n   Code structure:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read n and the integers\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: Sort\n            qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n\n            // Remove duplicates: we'll create a new array for unique elements\n            int *unique = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            int unique_size = 0;\n            if (n > 0) {\n                unique[0] = arr[0];\n                unique_size = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                    if (arr[i] != arr[i-1]) {\n                        unique[unique_size++] = arr[i];\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step 3: Check for consecutive triplet\n            int found = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i <= unique_size - 3; i++) {\n                if (unique[i] + 1 == unique[i+1] && unique[i+1] + 1 == unique[i+2]) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step 4: Set the intermediate string\n            char *s;\n            if (found) {\n                s = \"YES\";\n            } else {\n                s = \"NO\";\n            }\n\n            // Step 5: Count frequency of characters in s\n            int freq[256] = {0}; // initialize to 0\n            for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                freq[(unsigned char)s[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            int oddCount = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                    oddCount++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step 6: Apply condition and output\n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n                printf(\"First\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"Second\\n\");\n            }\n\n            free(arr);\n            free(unique);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the second program might have read the entire line? But in our case, the intermediate string is without newline because we are using \"YES\" or \"NO\" without a newline. This matches the behavior of the second program (which reads a line without the newline).\n\n   But what if the input to the entire chain is such that the first program outputs \"YES\" (without newline) and then the second program reads that? Our simulation is exactly that.\n\n   Therefore, the above C program should be correct.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n        Input: \n            6\n            1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n        Step 1: reads n=6, and the array [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n        Step 2: sorted -> [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> unique is the same -> unique_size=6\n        Step 3: found: at i=0: 1,2,3 -> consecutive -> found=1 -> s=\"YES\"\n        Step 5: \n            frequency: \n                'Y':1, 'E':1, 'S':1 -> oddCount=3\n        Step 6: condition: 3<=1? false -> 3%2 !=0 -> true -> output \"First\\n\"\n\n        So the entire output is \"First\\n\"\n\n   Another test:\n\n        Input: \n            3\n            1 2 4\n\n        Step 1: n=3, array [1,2,4]\n        Step 2: sorted: [1,2,4] -> unique: same -> size=3\n        Step 3: check: \n            i=0: 1,2,4 -> 1+1=2, 2+1=3 !=4 -> not consecutive.\n            So found=0 -> s=\"NO\"\n        Step 5: \n            \"NO\": 'N':1, 'O':1 -> oddCount=2\n        Step 6: condition: 2<=1? false -> 2%2==0 -> false -> output \"Second\\n\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the first program might have more numbers? But we are handling duplicates.\n\n   Let me test with duplicates:\n\n        Input: \n            5\n            1 2 2 3 4\n\n        After removing duplicates: [1,2,3,4] -> no consecutive triplet of three? \n            Check: \n                [1,2,3] -> consecutive? 1,2,3: 1+1=2, 2+1=3 -> yes -> found=1 -> \"YES\"\n\n        Then for \"YES\": oddCount=3 -> output \"First\"\n\n   So the program should work.\n\n   One more: \n        Input: \n            4\n            1 3 5 7\n\n        After: [1,3,5,7] -> no consecutive triplet -> found=0 -> \"NO\" -> then oddCount=2 -> \"Second\"\n\n   Therefore, we write the C code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We are using dynamic allocation for the array and the unique array. We free them at the end.\n\n   But note: the array size might be 0? Then we skip the duplicate removal loop.\n\n   Also, if n==0, then unique_size=0 -> then the triplet check loop runs from 0 to -3 -> skipped -> found=0 -> \"NO\", then \"NO\" has two letters -> oddCount=2 -> Second.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly."
