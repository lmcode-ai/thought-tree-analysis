But note: if K becomes 1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, but the condition would break because we start at 10 mod K (which is 0) and then we are looking for 1? Actually, if K becomes 1, then the remainder becomes 0, and the loop condition (0 != 1) would run forever? But note: the problem says if K is divisible by 2 or 5, return -1. So K is not divisible by 2 or 5, and we also divided by 7 if necessary. Then multiplied by 9 -> so K is now coprime to 10? Actually, we have:\n      - Original K: not divisible by 2 or 5. Then we divide by 7 if divisible by 7 -> so the new K (after *9) is 9 times a number that is coprime to 2 and 5 (and 7 if we divided). But note: 9 is 3^2, so the new K might have factors 3? However, the multiplicative order of 10 mod K exists only if 10 and K are coprime. After the transformation: we have K = (original K) * 9, but original K is not divisible by 2 or 5. So the new K is coprime to 10? Because:\n          - 2: original K is not divisible by 2 -> new K (multiplied by 9) is still not divisible by 2? Actually, if we divided by 7, then the new K is (original K/7)*9. Since original K is not divisible by 2, then original K/7 might not be an integer? Actually, we only divide by 7 if divisible by 7. So after division, we have an integer. Then multiplied by 9 -> still no factor of 2? Similarly, 5: same. And 10 is 2*5. So the new K is coprime to 10?",

Because:\n          - The factors of the new K: \n              - It doesn't have 2 (because original K didn't have 2, and we multiplied by 9 which is odd, and divided by 7 which is odd) -> so no 2.\n              - Similarly, no 5.\n          - So gcd(10, new K)=1 -> the multiplicative order exists. - The program returns `ans` which is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K (the new K).

So we are comparing 0 to 1 -> which is false. But wait: the problem says that we are looking for remainder 1? However, let's reexamine the original Java code:\n\n              int remainder = 10 % K;\n              while (remainder ! = 1) { ans++;\n                  remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n              } But if K==1, then 10 % 1 = 0, and then the condition (0 != 1) is true -> then we enter the loop. Then we do: remainder = (0 * 10) % 1 = 0 -> so we get stuck. How did the original Java program avoid this? Actually, note: after we set K = (K/7) * 9, then K=1 only if the original K was 7? Then we set K=1 -> then multiply by 9 -> K=9. So we never get K=1? Let me check: \n            If original K=7: then we divide by 7 -> K=1, then multiply by 9 -> K=9. If original K=1: then we don't divide by 7 (because 1%7 !=0) -> then K=1*9=9. So K is at least 9? Then we are safe? But what if the original K is 1? Then K becomes 9 -> then 10 mod 9 = 1 -> we break immediately -> ans=1. So we are safe. Therefore, we can write:\n\n              int ans = 1;\n              int rem = 10 % K;\n              while (rem ! = 1) { ans++;\n                  rem = (rem * 10) % K;\n              }\n              res1 = ans;\n\n          However, note: what if K is very large?

Then we set K=9 (as above) -> then 10 mod 9 is 1 -> the loop doesn't run -> so that's safe. Also, what if the multiplicative order is very long? We assume that the input constraints are such that it is acceptable. Step 3: Now we have res1 (an integer). We convert it to a string. We need to be cautious: the integer can be negative? (only -1 in the negative case). char buffer[20]; // enough for an integer (including negative)\n          sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", res1);\n\n      Step 4: Then we take the first character: buffer[0] and add 1. char c = buffer[0] + 1;\n          putchar(c);\n\n      But note: the second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)` which outputs a character. Then we do the same: output a single character. However, the original second program does not output a newline? So we should not output a newline. Therefore, the complete C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int K;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n              int res1; if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) {\n                  res1 = -1;\n              } else {\n                  if (K % 7 == 0) {\n                      K /= 7;\n                  }\n                  K *= 9;\n\n                  int ans = 1;\n                  int rem = 10 % K;\n                  // If K is 1, then rem=0? But we have multiplied by 9 -> so K>=9, so rem=10 mod K is 10 mod 9=1? Actually, if K==9, then 10%9=1 -> then we break. So we are safe. while (rem != 1) {\n                      ans++;\n                      // Avoid overflow: use long long for the multiplication\n                      rem = (int)( ( (long long)rem * 10 ) % K );\n                  }\n                  res1 = ans;\n              }\n\n              // Now convert res1 to a string\n              char buffer[20]; // enough for any 32-bit integer (max 11 digits, plus sign)\n              sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", res1);\n\n              // Output the next character after the first character of the string\n              char c = buffer[0] + 1;\n              putchar(c);\n\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n  But wait: what if the first program returns an integer that has more than 20 digits? It won't because the maximum value of an int is about 2e9 -> 10 digits. So 20 is safe. Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: Input 7 -> \n          First program: K=7 -> divisible by 7 -> K=1 -> then K=9 -> then rem=10%9=1 -> so res1=1. Then buffer = \"1\", then c = '1'+1 = '2'. Output: '2'. Correct. Example 2: Input 2 -> res1=-1 -> buffer = \"-1\", then c = '-'+1 = '.' -> output '.'. Example 3: Input 1 -> \n          K=1 -> not divisible by 2 or 5 -> then not divisible by 7 -> so K=9 -> then rem=10%9=1 -> res1=1 -> then output '2'. Example 4: Input 13 -> \n          res1=6 -> then buffer=\"6\" -> output '7'.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs. We must chain them: the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC174_C):\n  - Reads an integer K.\n  - If K is divisible by 2 or 5, it returns -1.\n  - If K is divisible by 7, it divides K by 7.\n  - Then multiplies K by 9.\n  - Then it finds the smallest positive integer `ans` such that 10^ans mod (K) = 1? Actually, the loop condition is `remainder != 1` and we start at 10 mod K and then multiply by 10 each time. This is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K (if it exists). But note: if K becomes 1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, but the condition would break because we start at 10 mod K (which is 0) and then we are looking for 1? Actually, if K becomes 1, then the remainder becomes 0, and the loop condition (0 != 1) would run forever? But note: the problem says if K is divisible by 2 or 5, return -1. So K is not divisible by 2 or 5, and we also divided by 7 if necessary. Then multiplied by 9 -> so K is now coprime to 10? Actually, we have:\n      - Original K: not divisible by 2 or 5. Then we divide by 7 if divisible by 7 -> so the new K (after *9) is 9 times a number that is coprime to 2 and 5 (and 7 if we divided). But note: 9 is 3^2, so the new K might have factors 3? However, the multiplicative order of 10 mod K exists only if 10 and K are coprime. After the transformation: we have K = (original K) * 9, but original K is not divisible by 2 or 5. So the new K is coprime to 10? Because:\n          - 2: original K is not divisible by 2 -> new K (multiplied by 9) is still not divisible by 2? Actually, if we divided by 7, then the new K is (original K/7)*9. Since original K is not divisible by 2, then original K/7 might not be an integer? Actually, we only divide by 7 if divisible by 7. So after division, we have an integer. Then multiplied by 9 -> still no factor of 2? Similarly, 5: same. And 10 is 2*5. So the new K is coprime to 10? Actually, we must note that the original condition: if K is divisible by 2 or 5, we return -1. Otherwise, we proceed. Then we adjust by dividing by 7 (if divisible) and then multiply by 9. The new K is then coprime to 10? Because:\n          - The factors of the new K: \n              - It doesn't have 2 (because original K didn't have 2, and we multiplied by 9 which is odd, and divided by 7 which is odd) -> so no 2.\n              - Similarly, no 5.\n          - So gcd(10, new K)=1 -> the multiplicative order exists.\n\n  - The program returns `ans` which is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K (the new K).\n\n  However, note: the loop starts at remainder = 10 % K, and then we do:\n        ans = 1\n        while (remainder != 1) {\n            ans++;\n            remainder = (remainder * 10) % K;\n        }\n  This is equivalent to: we are starting at 10^1 mod K, then 10^2 mod K, until we get 1.\n\n  So the first program outputs an integer.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a string (from standard input). But note: we are chaining, so the input to the second program is the output of the first (an integer).\n  - Then it prints the next character after the first character of the input string? Actually, the input is one line. The program reads one line and then prints the character that is one more than the first character of the string.\n\n  Example: \n      If the input to the second program is \"65\", then the first character is '6'. Then '6' + 1 -> '7'. So it prints '7'.\n\n  But note: the output of the first program is an integer. So if the first program outputs 65, then the second program reads the string \"65\", and then the first character is '6', then we output '7'.\n\n  However, what if the output of the first program is negative? The first program can output -1. Then the second program reads the string \"-1\". The first character is '-'. Then we do: '-' + 1 -> that's the character after '-' in ASCII, which is '.' (ASCII 45 -> 46 is '.').\n\n  But the problem says: the entire sequence should behave identically.\n\nPlan for the C program:\n  - We are going to combine both programs.\n  - The first part (originally the first program) will compute an integer (let's call it `result1`). This is the output that would have been printed by the first program.\n  - Then we pass `result1` as the input to the second program. However, the second program reads a string. So we must convert `result1` to a string (without any extra spaces, just the number as a string) and then the second program will take the first character of that string and add 1 (in the character's numeric value) to get the next character.\n\n  Steps:\n      Step 1: Read the integer K from stdin (like the first program).\n      Step 2: Compute the integer `ans` as in the first program (which we call `result1`).\n      Step 3: Instead of printing `result1`, we convert it to a string (in base 10) and then take the first character of that string and add 1 to it, and then output that character.\n\n  However, note: the second program reads the entire line. But the first program only outputs one integer (without any extra spaces). So the second program reads a string that is the decimal representation of `result1`.\n\n  Important: The second program does not output a newline? Actually, it uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`. So we must output exactly one character and then we are done.\n\n  But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning: the input to the chain is the input to the first program, and the output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\n  Therefore, the C program should:\n      - Read an integer (the input to the first program).\n      - Compute the integer that the first program would have output (call it `result1`).\n      - Convert `result1` to a string (so we get a sequence of digits, possibly with a minus sign if negative).\n      - Take the first character of that string (which is either a digit or a minus sign) and then output the next character in the ASCII table.\n\n  Example: \n      Input to the chain: 7 -> \n          First program: \n              K=7 -> divisible by 7 -> K becomes 1 -> then multiplied by 9 -> K=9.\n              Then we compute: \n                  remainder = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so the loop doesn't run -> returns 1.\n          Then the second program: \n              The string is \"1\". The first character is '1'. Then we output '1' + 1 -> '2'. So the output is '2'.\n\n  Another: \n      Input: 2 -> first program returns -1.\n      Then second program: string is \"-1\", first character is '-', then '-'+1 is '.' -> output '.'.\n\n  Implementation in C:\n\n      Step 1: Read an integer K.\n      Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (call it res1).\n          if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) \n              res1 = -1;\n          else {\n              if (K % 7 == 0) \n                  K = K / 7;\n              K = K * 9;\n              int ans = 1;\n              int rem = 10 % K;   // But note: if K==1, then 10%1 is 0? Then the condition rem != 1 is true and we loop? Actually, if K==1 then 10 mod 1 is 0, and then we do 0*10 mod 1 -> 0, so we loop infinitely? But we must avoid that.\n\n          However, note: if K becomes 1 (after dividing by 7 and multiplying by 9? Actually: if the original K is 7, then we do K=7/7=1, then K=1*9=9? Wait: no, we do:\n              if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;   // then K becomes 1? for input 7 -> then we do K *= 9 -> K=9.\n\n          So what if the original K is 1? \n              Then: K=1 -> divisible by 2? no. divisible by 5? no. Then we check divisible by 7? no -> so we set K = 1 * 9 = 9.\n          Then we compute: \n              rem = 10 % 9 = 1 -> so we break immediately -> ans=1.\n\n          What if the original K is 13? \n              Then: not divisible by 2 or 5 -> then not divisible by 7? -> then K = 13 * 9 = 117.\n              Then we compute:\n                  rem0 = 10 % 117 = 10 -> not 1 -> ans=1, then rem = 10*10 %117 = 100 %117=100 -> not 1 -> ans=2, then rem=100*10 %117 = 1000%117 = 1000 - 8*117 = 1000-936=64 -> not 1 -> ans=3, then 64*10 %117=640%117: 117*5=585, 640-585=55 -> not 1 -> ans=4, then 55*10=550 %117: 117*4=468, 550-468=82 -> not 1 -> ... until we get 1? Actually, the multiplicative order of 10 mod 117 is 6? Let me check: \n                  10^1 mod117=10\n                  10^2=100\n                  10^3=1000 mod117: 117*8=936 -> 1000-936=64\n                  10^4=640 mod117: 117*5=585 -> 640-585=55\n                  10^5=550 mod117: 117*4=468 -> 550-468=82\n                  10^6=820 mod117: 117*7=819 -> 1 -> so ans=6.\n\n          So the first program returns 6.\n\n          Then the second program: gets the string \"6\", then the first character is '6', then output '7'.\n\n      Step 3: Convert res1 to a string. We can use `sprintf` to write the integer to a character array.\n\n      Step 4: Take the first character of that string (index 0) and add 1 to it, then output that character.\n\n  However, note: what if the integer is negative? Then the string will start with '-'. Then we do: '-' + 1 -> '.'.\n\n  But what about large integers? The problem doesn't specify the range. The original Java program uses integers (which are 32-bit). So we can use `int` in C.\n\n  Steps in C:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          // Step 1: Read the integer K\n          int K;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n          // Step 2: Compute res1 (the result of the first program)\n          int res1;\n          if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) {\n              res1 = -1;\n          } else {\n              if (K % 7 == 0) {\n                  K /= 7;\n              }\n              K *= 9;\n\n              // Now we need to compute the multiplicative order of 10 mod K (if K>1) but note: if K==1, then we want the remainder to become 1? Actually, 10 mod 1 is 0, but we are waiting for 1? That will never happen. However, note: if K==1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, but we require 1 mod 1? Actually, 1 mod 1 is 0? So we are comparing 0 to 1 -> which is false. But wait: the problem says that we are looking for remainder 1? \n\n          However, let's reexamine the original Java code:\n\n              int remainder = 10 % K;\n              while (remainder != 1) {\n                  ans++;\n                  remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n              }\n\n          But if K==1, then 10 % 1 = 0, and then the condition (0 != 1) is true -> then we enter the loop. Then we do: remainder = (0 * 10) % 1 = 0 -> so we get stuck.\n\n          How did the original Java program avoid this? Actually, note: after we set K = (K/7) * 9, then K=1 only if the original K was 7? Then we set K=1 -> then multiply by 9 -> K=9. So we never get K=1? \n\n          Let me check: \n            If original K=7: then we divide by 7 -> K=1, then multiply by 9 -> K=9.\n            If original K=1: then we don't divide by 7 (because 1%7 !=0) -> then K=1*9=9.\n\n          So K is at least 9? Then we are safe? \n\n          But what if the original K is 1? Then K becomes 9 -> then 10 mod 9 = 1 -> we break immediately -> ans=1.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n              int ans = 1;\n              int rem = 10 % K;\n              while (rem != 1) {\n                  ans++;\n                  rem = (rem * 10) % K;\n              }\n              res1 = ans;\n\n          However, note: what if K is very large? The loop might run a lot? But the problem doesn't specify constraints. We assume that the input is such that the multiplicative order is not too big? \n\n          But the problem says to replicate the same behavior.\n\n          So:\n\n          } else {\n              if (K % 7 == 0) {\n                  K /= 7;\n              }\n              K *= 9;\n              int ans = 1;\n              int rem = 10 % K;\n              while (rem != 1) {\n                  ans++;\n                  rem = (long)rem * 10 % K;   // to avoid overflow, we cast to long? But note: K is at least 9, and rem is in [0, K-1]. Then rem*10 might be up to 10*(K-1). Since K can be up to about 2e9 (because original K is an int, and we multiply by 9 -> so K can be up to 9*(max_int/7) which is about 9*(2e9/7) -> about 2.5e9? But wait, we are multiplying by 9: so if original K is about 200 million, then K*9 is 1.8e9 -> which is within int? But then rem*10: 1.8e9 * 10 = 18e9 -> which is beyond 2e9 (max int is about 2e9). So we might get integer overflow.\n\n          We must avoid overflow. We can use long for the intermediate multiplication? But note: the modulus is an int (so at most about 2e9). We can do:\n\n              rem = (int)((long)rem * 10 % K);\n\n          However, the original Java program uses int. But in Java, the multiplication of two ints that might be large is done in 32 bits? But we want the modulus, and if we overflow the int, then we get a negative modulus? Then the modulus operation would be incorrect? \n\n          Actually, the original Java program does:\n\n              remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n\n          This is done in integers. But if the multiplication overflows, then the modulus might be computed incorrectly? However, the modulus operation is defined as the remainder when the dividend is divided by K. But if the dividend is negative, then the remainder is also negative? Then we adjust? Actually, the Java modulus for negative numbers returns a non-negative value? Not exactly: the sign of the modulus follows the dividend. But we are starting with a nonnegative remainder (because we did mod K) and then multiplied by 10 and then mod K. So we might get negative? Actually, no: because the modulus operation in Java for nonnegative numbers remains nonnegative? \n\n          But to be safe and avoid overflow in C, we can use a long long for the intermediate multiplication? Or note: K is an int (so at most about 2e9). Then the product rem * 10 might be up to 20e9? which is too big for a 32-bit int. So we should use a larger type.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              rem = (int)( ( (long long)rem * 10 ) % K );\n\n          But note: the modulus operation with a long long and an int: that's okay.\n\n          However, the problem says to replicate the same behavior. The original Java program uses 32-bit integers. But if the multiplication overflows, then we get an incorrect modulus? \n\n          Therefore, we must do the modulus in a way that avoids negative? Actually, we can use:\n\n              rem = (rem * 10) % K;   // in C, if the product overflows, then the behavior is undefined.\n\n          So we must avoid overflow. Therefore, we cast to long long.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the modulus is K (an int), so we can compute:\n\n              rem = (int)(((long long) rem * 10) % K);\n\n          But note: the modulus operation for a positive modulus K will yield a nonnegative remainder in the range [0, K-1]. However, the original Java program does the same? Actually, in Java, the modulus operator for positive modulus returns a nonnegative remainder? Actually, yes: the remainder is in the range [0, K-1] if both operands are positive? Actually, in Java, the modulus for positive numbers is nonnegative. So we want the same.\n\n          So we do:\n\n              long long temp = (long long)rem * 10;\n              rem = (int)(temp % K);\n\n          But note: the modulus operation for a positive K: the result is nonnegative.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: if K is negative? But K is positive: because we started with a positive K (from input? the problem doesn't say negative input) and then we multiplied by 9 (which is positive) and divided by 7 (if divisible, and we only do that if positive). So K is positive.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              int ans = 1;\n              int rem = 10 % K;\n              while (rem != 1) {\n                  ans++;\n                  // Use long long to avoid overflow in the multiplication\n                  rem = (int)(( (long long)rem * 10 ) % K);\n              }\n              res1 = ans;\n\n          But note: what if K is 1? Then we set K=9 (as above) -> then 10 mod 9 is 1 -> the loop doesn't run -> so that's safe.\n\n          Also, what if the multiplicative order is very long? We assume that the input constraints are such that it is acceptable.\n\n      Step 3: Now we have res1 (an integer). We convert it to a string. We need to be cautious: the integer can be negative? (only -1 in the negative case).\n\n          char buffer[20]; // enough for an integer (including negative)\n          sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", res1);\n\n      Step 4: Then we take the first character: buffer[0] and add 1.\n\n          char c = buffer[0] + 1;\n          putchar(c);\n\n      But note: the second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)` which outputs a character. Then we do the same: output a single character.\n\n      However, the original second program does not output a newline? So we should not output a newline.\n\n      Therefore, the complete C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int K;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n              int res1;\n              if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) {\n                  res1 = -1;\n              } else {\n                  if (K % 7 == 0) {\n                      K /= 7;\n                  }\n                  K *= 9;\n\n                  int ans = 1;\n                  int rem = 10 % K;\n                  // If K is 1, then rem=0? But we have multiplied by 9 -> so K>=9, so rem=10 mod K is 10 mod 9=1? Actually, if K==9, then 10%9=1 -> then we break. So we are safe.\n                  while (rem != 1) {\n                      ans++;\n                      // Avoid overflow: use long long for the multiplication\n                      rem = (int)( ( (long long)rem * 10 ) % K );\n                  }\n                  res1 = ans;\n              }\n\n              // Now convert res1 to a string\n              char buffer[20]; // enough for any 32-bit integer (max 11 digits, plus sign)\n              sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", res1);\n\n              // Output the next character after the first character of the string\n              char c = buffer[0] + 1;\n              putchar(c);\n\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n  But wait: what if the first program returns an integer that has more than 20 digits? It won't because the maximum value of an int is about 2e9 -> 10 digits. So 20 is safe.\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: Input 7 -> \n          First program: K=7 -> divisible by 7 -> K=1 -> then K=9 -> then rem=10%9=1 -> so res1=1.\n          Then buffer = \"1\", then c = '1'+1 = '2'. Output: '2'. Correct.\n\n      Example 2: Input 2 -> res1=-1 -> buffer = \"-1\", then c = '-'+1 = '.' -> output '.'.\n\n      Example 3: Input 1 -> \n          K=1 -> not divisible by 2 or 5 -> then not divisible by 7 -> so K=9 -> then rem=10%9=1 -> res1=1 -> then output '2'.\n\n      Example 4: Input 13 -> \n          res1=6 -> then buffer=\"6\" -> output '7'.\n\n  However, note: the second program reads the entire line? But the first program only outputs one integer? So the string we are generating is the entire output of the first program. The second program then reads that entire line and takes the first character. So we are only generating the integer as a string without any extra spaces. This matches.\n\n  But note: the second program uses `s = r.readLine()`, so it reads the entire line. Our buffer has no newline? Actually, the first program in Java uses `pw.println(solve())` which appends a newline. But the second program reads a line (which includes the newline? No: `readLine` in Java does not include the newline). Then the second program takes the first character of the string without the newline.\n\n  However, our C program for the first part does not output the integer at all. We are just converting it to a string. So we don't add a newline. This matches the second program's expectation: the entire output of the first program is the integer without any extra characters? Actually, the first program uses `println` which adds a newline. But the second program reads the entire line (which includes the newline? Actually, no: `readLine` returns a string without the newline). \n\n  But note: the chaining is done by the operating system: the first program outputs the integer and a newline. Then the second program reads the integer as a line (without the newline). So the string that the second program gets is the integer in base10 without any extra spaces, and without the newline.\n\n  However, in our combined program, we are not printing the integer. We are converting the integer to a string (without a newline) and then taking the first character. So we are effectively simulating the second program reading the integer without the trailing newline? \n\n  Actually, the second program in the chain would read the entire output of the first program. The first program outputs the integer and then a newline. The second program's `readLine` reads the integer and stops at the newline, so the string it gets is the integer without the newline. \n\n  But in our combined program, we are generating the integer as a string without a newline. Then we take the first character. This is equivalent to the second program reading the integer without the newline? Yes.\n\n  Therefore, we do not add a newline in the conversion.\n\n  However, note: the first program in Java outputs the integer and then a newline. But in the chain, the second program only sees the integer without the newline. So our simulation is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the integer is negative and has more than one character? We only take the first character. For example, -1: the string is \"-1\", then the first character is '-'. Then we output '.'.\n\n  This is exactly what the second program does.\n\n  Therefore, the code below.\n\n  Important: We must avoid any extra I/O. We only read the integer at the beginning and then output one character at the end.\n\n  Let's code accordingly."
