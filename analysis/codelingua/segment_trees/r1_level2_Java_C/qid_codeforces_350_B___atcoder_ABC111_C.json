Actually, the entire string reversal does not change the order of the characters within a token? But it does: the token \"02\" in the original string is at positions [3]='0', [4]='2'. When reversed, these become at the new indices [5]='0', [4]='2'? and then we have a space at new index3 and new index6?

This is a contradiction. Therefore, the example in the first program for the chain [1,20,300] would output:\n\n          ans = 3\n          the string: \"300 20 1\" But we want it to output: \"300 02 1\" -> which is not happening.",

But that's not necessarily true. However, the entire array frequency for any value x is vo[x] + ve[x]. Therefore, the maximum frequency in the entire array is:\n\n            vt[0] = max_{x} (vo[x] + ve[x])\n\n        And vo[0] = max_{x} vo[x], and ve[0] = max_{x} ve[x]. And we have:\n\n            vt[0] <= vo[0] + ve[0]   (because vo[x]+ve[x] <= vo[0]+ve[0] for any x? but no: vo[x] <= vo[0] and ve[x] <= ve[0], so vo[x]+ve[x] <= vo[0]+ve[0]) Therefore, vt[0] <= vo[0]+ve[0]. And the condition is: if vt[0] == vo[0]+ve[0], then the maximum frequency in the entire array is the sum of the two maximum frequencies in the odd and even arrays? But note: this can happen only if the value that achieves vo[0] is the same as the value that achieves ve[0]? Not necessarily: it could be two different values? Actually, no: because the entire array frequency of a value is the sum of its own vo and ve. Example: \n          Let value A: vo[A]=vo[0] (maximum in vo) and value B: ve[B]=ve[0] (maximum in ve). Then the frequency of A in the entire array is vo[A] + ve[A] <= vo[0] + ve[A] <= vo[0] + ve[0] (because ve[A] <= ve[0]). Similarly, the frequency of B is vo[B] + ve[B] <= vo[0] + ve[0]. And the condition vt[0] = vo[0]+ve[0] means there exists a value x such that vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0]? But wait: we are not guaranteed that the same value x achieves both. However, if there is a value x that has vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0], then the frequency of x is vo[0]+ve[0] and that equals vt[0]. But what if no value has both? then the maximum frequency in the entire array is less than vo[0]+ve[0]? Therefore, the condition (vo[0]+ve[0] == vt[0]) is equivalent to: there exists a value x that is the most frequent in the odd positions and also the most frequent in the even positions? But note: it could be that one value has the maximum in the odd positions and a different value has the maximum in the even positions, and then the frequency of the entire array of the most frequent value is less than vo[0]+ve[0].",

And as argued, this implies that there is a value x that has vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0]? Why? \n          Let x be the value that achieves vt[0] = vo[x] + ve[x]. Then we have:\n             vo[x] + ve[x] = vt[0] = vo[0] + ve[0]   (by condition) And since vo[x] <= vo[0] and ve[x] <= ve[0], the only possibility is vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0]. So the condition is true if and only if there is a value x that is the most frequent in the odd positions and the most frequent in the even positions. Then the Java program does:\n\n            ans = min(n - vo[0] - ve[1], n - vo[1] - ve[0]);\n\n        Otherwise:\n\n            ans = n - vo[0] - ve[0];\n\n        This matches.

But the qsort will sort the entire array, so we get the frequencies in descending order. The zeros will be at the end. This is the same as the Java program. Therefore, we are good. Let me test with a small example:\n\n          First program: \n            n=3, a = [?,?,?], b = [?,?,?] -> but we don't care, we assume we have computed the chain. Suppose the chain is [300,20,1] for n2=3. Then the second program:\n\n            v2 = [300,20,1]\n\n            Then:\n              i=0 (even): \n                  ve[300]++, vt[300]++\n              i=1 (odd):\n                  vo[20]++, vt[20]++\n              i=2 (even):\n                  ve[1]++, vt[1]++\n\n            Then vo: \n                vo[20]=1, others 0 -> sorted: [1,0,0,...]\n            ve: \n                ve[300]=1, ve[1]=1 -> sorted: [1,1,0,0,...]\n            vt: \n                vt[300]=1, vt[20]=1, vt[1]=1 -> sorted: [1,1,1,0,...] -> so vt[0]=1, vt[1]=1, vt[2]=1. Now, condition: vo[0]+ve[0] = 1+1 = 2, and vt[0]=1 -> not equal. So ans2 = n2 - vo[0] - ve[0] = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1.\n\n          Output: 1. This matches. We'll write the C program accordingly. Edge: if n2=0, then the second program:\n\n          vo, ve, vt: all zeros. vo[0]=0, ve[0]=0, vt[0]=0 -> condition: 0+0==0 -> true. then ans2 = min(0 - 0 - ve[1], 0 - vo[1] - 0) = min( - ve[1], - vo[1]) -> which is negative? But the Java program for n2=0:\n\n          The arrays vo, ve, vt are all zeros. Then:\n\n            vo[0] = 0, ve[0]=0, vt[0]=0 -> condition true. Then it computes:\n               n - vo[0] - ve[1] = 0 - 0 - ve[1] But what is ve[1]? the array ve is of zeros, and sorted in descending order, so ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0. So option1 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0, option2 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0. Then ans2 = min(0,0)=0. In C, we do:\n\n          ans2 = min(0 - 0 - ve[1], 0 - vo[1] - 0) = min( - ve[1], - vo[1] ) But what is ve[1]? in the sorted array, after sorting, ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0, ... so ve[1]=0. Then we get min(0,0)=0. But note: our qsort sorts the entire array, and the array is initialized to zeros, so after sorting, the entire array is zeros? Actually, we are sorting the entire array of SIZE=100010, and the array is all zeros. Then after sorting in descending order, it's still all zeros? Then vo[0]=0, vo[1]=0, ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0. So we compute:\n\n          option1 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n          option2 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n          ans2 = 0. So we output 0. That's correct. Therefore, the C program is as below. Note: We must be cautious about the memory allocation for the chain and the path. Also, note: the first program condition in the while loop: \n            while (x != 0 && x>=1 && x<=n && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1) We added bounds check for x (x>=1 and x<=n) because st and a are defined only for 1..n.\n\n        Also, note: the frequency array `num` is defined for 0..n. The value 0 is allowed? The first program: \n            while (x != 0 && ...) So if x==0, we break. We'll assume that b[i] can be 0. Now, we write the final C program. Let me test with a small chain. However, due to complexity, we rely on the above. Code:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs. We must chain them: the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nFirst, let's understand the first program (codeforces_350_B):\n\nInput: \n  - First integer `n`\n  - Then an array `a` of `n` integers (indexed 1..n)\n  - Then an array `b` of `n` integers (indexed 1..n)\n\nOutput:\n  - First integer `ans` (which is the length of a chain)\n  - Then a string `ss` which is the chain of indices (space separated)\n\nHowever, note that the second program (atcoder_ABC111_C) expects:\n\nInput:\n  - First integer `n`\n  - Then `n` integers in the next line(s)\n\nBut wait: the output of the first program is two lines: \n   Line1: integer `ans`\n   Line2: a space separated list of `ans` numbers (the chain)\n\nBut the second program expects:\n   First integer `n` (which would be the `ans` from the first program) and then `n` integers.\n\nHowever, the second program reads:\n   int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\n   then an array of `n` integers.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is two lines. The second program reads the first token as `n` and then the next `n` tokens.\n\nBut the second line of the first program's output is a string of space separated numbers. So the entire output of the first program is:\n\n   ans\n   i1 i2 ... i_ans\n\nSo the input to the second program would be:\n   The first token is `ans` (which is an integer) and then the next `ans` tokens (which are the integers on the second line).\n\nBut note: the second program uses `sc.next()` which reads tokens. So the second program will read `ans` as `n`, and then the next `ans` numbers as the array.\n\nTherefore, we can chain the two programs by:\n\n  1. Run the first program on the original input (which is the same as the first program's input: n, then array a, then array b).\n  2. The output of the first program is then fed as input to the second program.\n\nHowever, the second program does something entirely different: it counts frequencies in the array and computes an answer.\n\nBut note: the two programs are independent and we are chaining the output of the first to the input of the second.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects the same format as the first? Actually, the first program's output is two lines. The second program expects:\n\n   n\n   then n integers (which are the tokens on the next line(s))\n\nBut the first program's output is:\n   Line1: ans (an integer)\n   Line2: a string of ans integers (space separated)\n\nThis exactly matches the input format expected by the second program? \n\nHowever, the second program's problem is about an array of `n` integers. It does:\n\n   int n = sc.nextInt();\n   for (int i=0; i<n; i++) v[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nSo the output of the first program (which is two lines: the first line is an integer, the second line is a list of integers) is exactly the input of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n  Input (to the chain): \n      n\n      a1 a2 ... an   (for the first array a)\n      b1 b2 ... bn   (for the first array b)\n\n  Then the first program outputs:\n      ans\n      i1 i2 ... i_ans\n\n  Then the second program takes:\n      n = ans\n      and the array [i1, i2, ..., i_ans]\n\n  Then the second program outputs an integer.\n\nBut note: the second program also outputs an integer (which is the final output).\n\nSo we have to combine both programs into one C program that:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial input (n, then two arrays a and b of size n).\n  Step 2: Simulate the first program to produce two outputs: \n          - an integer `ans1`\n          - and a list of `ans1` integers (the chain)\n  Step 3: Use that output as input for the second program: \n          - set n2 = ans1\n          - set the array v for the second program to the chain of integers (with n2 elements)\n  Step 4: Run the second program on that input and produce the final output.\n\nConstraints:\n  - Only the first block (step 1) does reading (from stdin).\n  - Only the last block (step 4) does writing (to stdout).\n  - Intermediate steps (step 2 and 3) process without I/O.\n\nWe'll write a single C program that does:\n\n  // Step 1: Read initial input\n  int n;\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  int *a = (int*)malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));\n  int *b = (int*)malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));\n  for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n  for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n\n  // Step 2: First program logic (codeforces_350_B)\n  ... compute the first program's output: we get an integer `ans1` and an array `chain` of `ans1` integers.\n\n  // Step 3: Second program input preparation\n  //   The input to the second program is: \n  //        n2 = ans1\n  //        an array v of n2 integers: the chain we just got.\n\n  // Step 4: Second program logic (atcoder_ABC111_C) on the array `chain` of size `ans1`\n\n  // Step 5: Output the result of the second program.\n\nHowever, note that the second program (atcoder_ABC111_C) has a problem: it uses arrays of fixed size 100010. We can do the same.\n\nBut note: the chain from the first program might be of length up to n (which is <= 10^5? the problem doesn't specify, but the arrays are of size 100010 in the second program). So we are safe.\n\nLet's break down the first program:\n\n  It does:\n    int n;\n    a[1..n], b[1..n] from input.\n\n    Then it creates an array `num` of size n+1 (indexed 1..n) such that num[i] = frequency of i in array b (but note: b[i] might be 0? the code has `num[b[i]]++` and then `x = b[i]` and then `x != 0` -> so 0 is a sentinel?).\n\n    Then it initializes:\n        ss = \"\" (string)\n        ans = 0\n        st[] (boolean array) to mark visited.\n\n    Then for each i from 1 to n:\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            mark st[i] = true\n            then traverse: start at i, then go to b[i], then b[b[i]], ... until:\n                - we hit a node that is already marked (st[x] is true) OR\n                - num[x] != 1 (meaning x appears more than once in b) OR\n                - x==0 OR\n                - a[x]==1 (but note: the condition says `a[x]!=1` in the loop condition? Actually the condition is: `while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] != 1)`\n\n            So we break when any of these fails.\n\n            And during the traversal, we build a string by appending the current index (but reversing the digits? Actually, they are using `StringBuilder` and then reversing the string for each number? That seems odd).\n\n    Actually, let me see:\n\n        sss = new StringBuilder();\n        sss.append(i);   // so sss is the string of i\n        sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());   // but then we reverse the string of i? \n\n        Example: if i=123, then we reverse to \"321\", then we put a space and then that reversed string.\n\n        Then for the next x, we do the same: convert x to string, reverse it, and append.\n\n        Then at the end, we reverse the entire string `sb` and then take the string.\n\n        Why? \n\n        Actually, the intended output is the chain from the start to the end? But they are building the chain backwards? \n\n        They start at i and then go to b[i], then b[b[i]], etc.\n\n        But when they build the string, they do:\n\n            sb initially: \" 321\" (if i=123)\n            then next x=456: then we append \" 654\" -> so the string becomes \" 321 654\"\n\n            Then they reverse the entire string: becomes \"456 123\" -> which is the chain in reverse order? \n\n        But note: the problem says the chain should be from the start to the end? \n\n        Actually, the problem in the first program: we are building the chain from the start (i) and then following the b pointers. The chain is i -> b[i] -> ... \n\n        However, when we output, we want to output the chain starting from the first element (i) and then the next? But the program reverses the entire string.\n\n        Example: \n          i=1 -> then we append \" 1\" (but reversed is \"1\") -> then next x=2 -> append \" 2\" (reversed is \"2\") -> then we have sb = \"1 2\" (without the quotes, actually with a space at the beginning: \" 1 2\"?) and then reverse the entire string: becomes \"2 1\" (without the space at the end? because the space is at the beginning) -> actually:\n\n          Initially: sb = \" \" + sss.reverse() -> so for i=1: we do \" \" + \"1\" -> \" 1\"\n          Then for x=2: we do \" \" + \"2\" -> then sb becomes \" 1 2\"\n          Then we reverse: \n                original: \" 1 2\" -> reverse: \"2 1 \" -> but note: the first character is space? Actually, when reversed, the space is at the end? \n\n          But the program prints: \n              System.out.println(ans);\n              System.out.println(ss);\n\n          So if ans=2 and ss is the reversed string of \" 1 2\", which is \"2 1 \"? \n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might require the chain in reverse order? \n\n        Looking at the problem: \"codeforces_350_B\" - we don't have the problem statement. \n\n        However, note: the program is building the chain by starting at the node i and then following the b pointers (which point to the next). So the chain is:\n\n          i -> b[i] -> b[b[i]] -> ...\n\n        And they want to output the chain from the beginning (i) to the end? \n\n        But the way they build the string: they are appending the current node (as a string) and then the next node. But then they reverse the entire string. \n\n        Example: if we have chain: 1 -> 2 -> 3, then:\n\n          i=1: append \" 1\" -> then x=2: append \" 2\" -> then x=3: append \" 3\" -> then we have \" 1 2 3\", then reverse to \"3 2 1\".\n\n        So the chain is output in reverse order? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program will receive:\n\n          First line: 3\n          Second line: 3 2 1\n\n        So the second program will see an array [3,2,1] of size 3.\n\n        Therefore, we must simulate the same.\n\n        How to do in C?\n\n        We don't need to build the string by reversing each number and then the entire string. We can just store the indices in an array (the chain) and then output the array in reverse order? \n\n        Actually, the first program builds the chain in the order: i, then b[i], then b[b[i]], ... until it stops. But then it reverses the entire string representation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build the chain in a dynamic array (or array) in the order of the traversal (so the first element is i, then the next is b[i], then b[b[i]], ...). Then when we output, we can reverse the array? \n\n        But note: the program does:\n\n          sss = new StringBuilder();\n          sss.append(i);   -> then we reverse that string? Actually, for the number 10, the string is \"10\", reverse is \"01\" -> which is not 10. This is a bug? \n\n        Actually, the Java code:\n\n          sss.append(i);   // for i=10 -> \"10\"\n          then reverse: becomes \"01\" -> which is 1? \n\n        This is clearly wrong.\n\n        Let me check: the problem ID is \"codeforces_350_B\", and I recall that in Codeforces problems, the indices are integers. The problem does not require reversing the digits of the index. \n\n        Therefore, I suspect this part is a mistake in the provided code? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might require the digits to be reversed? But that seems very odd.\n\n        Since we are not given the problem statement, we must replicate the behavior exactly.\n\n        How can we do without string reversals? \n\n        Actually, we don't need to build a string during the traversal. We can store the entire chain in an array (in the order of traversal: from the start to the end) and then when we output, we output the chain in reverse order (from the last element to the first) as space separated? \n\n        But note: the program does:\n\n          sb.reverse().toString()\n\n        and then prints that.\n\n        So if we have stored the chain in an array `path` of length `s` (from the start to the last element), then we can output the chain by starting from the last element to the first? \n\n        Actually, the string builder `sb` is built by:\n\n          Initially: we append a space and the reversed string of i.\n          Then for each step: we append a space and the reversed string of x.\n\n          Then we reverse the entire string.\n\n        Example: \n          i=1: \n             sss = new StringBuilder(\"1\"); reversed is \"1\", then we do: sb = \" 1\" -> actually: \n                 sb = new StringBuilder(); \n                 then: sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()) -> which is \" \" + \"1\" -> \" 1\"\n          Then for x=2: \n                 sss = new StringBuilder(\"2\"); reversed is \"2\", then we do: sb.append(\" \" + \"2\") -> becomes \" 1 2\"\n          Then we reverse the entire sb: becomes \"2 1 \" -> but note: the space at the end? \n\n        Actually, the entire string is: \" 1 2\" -> reversed: \n          original: [' ', '1', ' ', '2'] -> reversed: ['2',' ','1',' '] -> which is \"2 1 \" (with a trailing space?).\n\n        Then the program prints: \n            System.out.println(ans);   // 2\n            System.out.println(ss);    // \"2 1 \" (without the quotes, but with the trailing space)\n\n        However, in Java, the println will print the string as is. The second line has trailing space? \n\n        But the second program uses Scanner which uses whitespace as delimiters, so the trailing space is ignored. So the tokens are 2 and 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate in C:\n\n          We store the chain in an array in the order of the traversal: \n              path[0] = i\n              path[1] = b[i]\n              path[2] = b[b[i]]\n              ... until we stop.\n\n          Then we output the chain in reverse order: from the last element to the first? \n\n          But note: the entire string is built by appending the reversed string of each number and then the entire string is reversed. \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that:\n\n            The entire string is built as: \n                s = \" \" + reverse_string(i) + \" \" + reverse_string(x1) + ... \n            Then we reverse s to get the output.\n\n          This is equivalent to: \n                s = ... + reverse_string(x1) + \" \" + reverse_string(i)   [without the initial space?] \n\n          Actually, the entire reversal of the string will put the last number (in the chain) first? \n\n          So if we have the chain: i, x1, x2, ... , xk (with k = s-1) then the output string is: \n                reverse_string(xk) + \" \" + ... + reverse_string(x1) + \" \" + reverse_string(i)\n\n          And then we have to note the spaces: the original string had a space at the beginning? and then each number is appended with a space and the reversed string.\n\n          After reversal, the last number in the chain (xk) becomes the first token? and the first number (i) becomes the last token? \n\n          So the tokens in the second line are: \n                reverse_string(xk), reverse_string(xk-1), ... , reverse_string(i)\n\n          But the second program then reads these tokens and uses them as integers? \n\n          But if we have a number like 10, then reverse_string(10) is \"01\", which is not a valid integer? \n\n          This is a critical issue.\n\n        Therefore, I must conclude that the provided Java program has a bug for numbers with trailing zeros? \n\n        However, the problem states: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n        So we must replicate the same behavior, even if it is buggy.\n\n        How to reverse the digits of an integer in C? \n\n          We can convert the integer to a string, reverse the string, and then output? But then the second program will read that string and convert to an integer? \n\n          But note: the second program reads tokens and then converts to integer. The token \"01\" will be converted to 1? because in Java, Integer.parseInt(\"01\") is 1. Similarly in C, atoi(\"01\") is 1.\n\n          However, the chain of indices should be the same indices? but the output of the first program is the indices as integers? but the program outputs the reversed string of the integer. \n\n          Example: if we have an index 10, we output the string \"01\", which when read by the second program becomes 1. \n\n          This is not the same as the index 10. \n\n          Therefore, the first program is flawed. But we are required to replicate.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have constraints that the indices are single-digit? \n\n        The problem says: n (the size) can be up to 100000? so indices are from 1 to 100000? which are multi-digit. \n\n        This is a serious issue.\n\n        Let me reexamine the Java code: \n\n          They do: \n            sss = new StringBuilder();\n            sss.append(i);   // this appends the integer i as a decimal string.\n            then: sss.reverse() -> so for i=10, it becomes \"01\"\n\n          Then they append to the main string builder.\n\n          Then at the end, they reverse the entire string and then print.\n\n          But when the second program reads the token \"01\", it will read it as the integer 1. \n\n          However, in the chain, the index 10 should be passed as 10? \n\n          This is a bug. \n\n        Given the ambiguity, we have two choices:\n\n          1. Replicate the exact behavior (with the string reversal) so that the output tokens are the reversed digit strings of the indices (which when read by the second program become integers that are the reverses of the original indices?).\n\n          2. Assume the intended behavior was to output the indices as integers (without reversing the digits) and that the string reversal was a mistake.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n        Therefore, we must replicate the bug.\n\n        However, the second program uses the integers as array indices? \n\n        The second program: \n          It creates an array `v` of the input integers. Then it uses them as indices? \n\n          But note: the second program does:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                v[i] = ...   // the integer read\n\n            Then it uses:\n                vt[v[i]]++; \n                and if even index, then ve[v[i]]++; else vo[v[i]]++;\n\n          So if the first program outputs the chain as the reversed-digit strings (which are then read as integers by the second program), then the second program uses the reversed integers.\n\n        This is entirely different from the original chain.\n\n        Therefore, I suspect the code provided for the first program is incorrect. \n\n        But without the problem statement, we cannot fix it. \n\n        The instruction: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n        So we must replicate the same output as the first program (which is the reversed-digit string for each index and then the entire string reversed) and then feed that to the second program.\n\n        However, note: the second program reads tokens as integers. So the token \"01\" becomes 1. \n\n        Therefore, the second program will see an array of integers that are the reverses of the original indices? \n\n        How to reverse the digits of an integer? \n\n        We can do:\n\n          void reverse_digits(int num, char* buf) {\n            sprintf(buf, \"%d\", num);\n            reverse_string(buf);\n          }\n\n        But then we have to convert the string back to an integer? \n\n        Actually, in the first program, we are only building a string for output. We are not using the reversed integer as an integer until the second program reads it.\n\n        Therefore, we can avoid converting the reversed string back to an integer in the first program? \n\n        The first program should output the chain as a string of reversed-digit numbers (with the entire string reversed). \n\n        But note: the first program outputs:\n\n          System.out.println(ans);\n          System.out.println(ss);\n\n        The second program reads:\n\n          int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());   // this reads the first token (the integer ans) normally.\n\n          Then for the next n tokens: they are strings that are the reversed-digit of the indices? and then the entire string is reversed so the order of the tokens is reversed.\n\n        Example: \n          Chain: [1, 20, 300] \n          The first program:\n\n            i=1: \n               append: \" \" + reverse_string(1) -> \" 1\"\n            then x=20: \n               append: \" \" + reverse_string(20) -> \" 02\" -> so now \" 1 02\"\n            then x=300: \n               append: \" \" + reverse_string(300) -> \" 003\" -> so now \" 1 02 003\"\n\n            Then reverse the entire string: \"300 02 1 \" -> becomes \"3000201 \"? \n\n            Actually, the entire string is: \" 1 02 003\" -> reversed: \n                  ' ', '1', ' ', '0','2',' ','0','0','3' \n                  reversed: '3','0','0',' ','2','0',' ','1',' ' -> so the tokens are \"300\", \"02\", \"1\" (with trailing space).\n\n          Then the second program reads:\n             n = 3   (from the first line)\n             tokens: \"300\", \"02\", \"1\" -> which become integers 300, 2, 1.\n\n          But the original chain was [1,20,300] and now the second program gets [300,2,1]. \n\n        This is not the same as the original chain. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        So the second program must get the same tokens as the first program outputs.\n\n        Therefore, we must output the chain exactly as the first program does: \n          First, the integer `ans1` (the length of the chain) as a normal integer.\n          Then, a string that is built by:\n               Start with an empty string.\n               For each node in the chain in the order of traversal (from the start to the end):\n                   convert the node to a string, reverse that string, and then add a space and that reversed string.\n               Then reverse the entire string.\n\n        Then the second program will read the tokens and convert them to integers? \n\n        But note: the second program uses `sc.next()` which returns the next token. The token for the integer 10 reversed is \"01\", which becomes the integer 1.\n\n        So the second program will get an array of integers that are the reverses of the original indices? \n\n        However, wait: the entire string is reversed. The tokenization is done by whitespace. The tokens in the string are separated by spaces. When we reverse the entire string, the tokens become reversed and also the order of tokens is reversed.\n\n        Example: \n          Original chain: [1, 20, 300] \n          Step 1: Build a string: \n               start: \"\"\n               add: \" \" + reverse(1) -> \" 1\"\n               add: \" \" + reverse(20) -> \" 1 02\"\n               add: \" \" + reverse(300) -> \" 1 02 003\"\n          Step 2: Reverse the entire string: \n               \" 1 02 003\" -> reversed: \"300 02 1 \"? \n               But note: the spaces are also reversed. The tokenization will be:\n                   first token: \"300\", then \"02\", then \"1\"\n\n          So the integers are 300, 2, 1.\n\n        Therefore, the second program gets an array [300,2,1] for n=3.\n\n        But the original chain was [1,20,300]. \n\n        This is the reverse of the chain? and also each number is digit-reversed? \n\n        But note: the chain was built from the start to the end: 1->20->300. \n        The output of the first program is the entire chain in reversed order (last element first) and each element is digit-reversed? \n\n        However, the digit reversal is applied to each number individually, and then the entire string (which includes the spaces) is reversed, which reverses the order of the tokens.\n\n        Therefore, the token order is reversed: the last element becomes the first token, and the first element becomes the last token. And within a token, the digits are reversed.\n\n        So we can achieve the same by:\n\n          Step A: Build an array of the chain in the order of traversal (start to end): [1,20,300]\n          Step B: Reverse this array to get [300,20,1]\n          Step C: For each number in the reversed array, reverse its digits to get [3, 2, 1]? -> but 300 reversed is 003 -> which is 3? \n\n        But note: 300 -> reversed string is \"003\" -> which as an integer is 3? but the token is \"003\" which is read as 3? \n\n        However, in the example above, the token for 300 was \"300\" in the final output? \n\n        Let me do the string reversal step carefully:\n\n          We have the string: \" 1 02 003\"\n\n          Now reverse the entire string: \n            Original: [' ','1',' ','0','2',' ','0','0','3']\n            Reversed: ['3','0','0',' ','2','0',' ','1',' ']\n\n          Then when we split by spaces, we get tokens: \"300\", \"02\", \"1\"\n\n          So the tokens are not \"003\", \"20\", \"1\" but rather \"300\", \"02\", \"1\".\n\n        Why? Because we reversed the entire string, so the last token (which was \"003\") becomes the first token and the entire string of \"003\" is reversed to \"300\"? \n\n        Actually, the token \"003\" in the original string is stored as ['0','0','3'] and when reversed in the entire string, the entire token is reversed? \n\n        But note: the entire string reversal does not reverse each token individually, but the entire sequence of characters.\n\n        So the token \"003\" becomes the substring from the last character to the first: so the last character of the entire string is '3', then '0', then '0', then a space? \n\n        Actually, the original string is: \" 1 02 003\"\n\n        Breaking down the positions:\n\n          index0: ' '\n          index1: '1'\n          index2: ' '\n          index3: '0'\n          index4: '2'\n          index5: ' '\n          index6: '0'\n          index7: '0'\n          index8: '3'\n\n        Reversed: \n          new_string[0] = '3' (old index8)\n          new_string[1] = '0' (old index7)\n          new_string[2] = '0' (old index6)\n          new_string[3] = ' ' (old index5)\n          new_string[4] = '2' (old index4)\n          new_string[5] = '0' (old index3)\n          new_string[6] = ' ' (old index2)\n          new_string[7] = '1' (old index1)\n          new_string[8] = ' ' (old index0)\n\n        So the tokens are: \n          from index0 to index2: \"300\" (because there is a space at index3) -> so the first token is \"300\"\n          then next token: from index4 to index6: \"02\" (because at index6 there is a space) -> but wait, index3 is space, then index4 is '2', index5 is '0', index6 is space -> so the next token is \"20\" reversed? -> no, the string is \"2\",\"0\" -> that's \"20\" but we have \"02\" in the example? \n\n        Actually, in the reversed string, the token for the second number is taken from the characters: \n          after the first space (at index3) and then we take until the next space (at index6): \n             index4: '2', index5: '0' -> so the token is \"20\"? \n\n        But in our example, we got \"02\" in the output? \n\n        This is because the original token for the number 20 was stored as \"02\" (because we reversed the digits of 20 to get \"02\"). Then when we reversed the entire string, the token \"02\" became the substring starting from the space after \"1\" and then the next space? \n\n        Actually, the entire string reversal does not change the order of the characters within a token? \n\n        But it does: the token \"02\" in the original string is at positions [3]='0', [4]='2'. When reversed, these become at the new indices [5]='0', [4]='2'? and then we have a space at new index3 and new index6? \n\n        The reversed string is: \"300 02 1 \" -> wait, I see: \n          The reversed string: \n             new_string[0] = '3'\n             new_string[1] = '0'\n             new_string[2] = '0'\n             new_string[3] = ' ' \n             new_string[4] = '2'   -> from old index4\n             new_string[5] = '0'   -> from old index3\n             new_string[6] = ' '\n             new_string[7] = '1'\n             new_string[8] = ' '\n\n        So the tokens are: \n          token0: \"300\" (from index0 to index2, then space at index3)\n          token1: \"20\" (from index4 to index5, then space at index6) -> but wait, we have '2' at index4 and '0' at index5 -> so the token is \"20\", not \"02\". \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, the example in the first program for the chain [1,20,300] would output:\n\n          ans = 3\n          the string: \"300 20 1\"\n\n        But we want it to output: \"300 02 1\" -> which is not happening.\n\n        The issue is that the first program reverses the digits of each number individually and then appends, and then reverses the entire string. This is not the same as reversing the entire chain of digits without regard to token boundaries.\n\n        Let me try with the first program in Java for the chain [1,20,300]:\n\n          i=1: \n             sss = new StringBuilder(\"1\"); reversed is \"1\"\n             sb = new StringBuilder(); then we do: sb.append(\" \" + \"1\") -> so sb = \" 1\"\n\n          then x=20: \n             sss = new StringBuilder(\"20\"); reversed is \"02\"\n             sb.append(\" \" + \"02\") -> now sb = \" 1 02\"\n\n          then x=300:\n             sss = new StringBuilder(\"300\"); reversed is \"003\"\n             sb.append(\" \" + \"003\") -> now sb = \" 1 02 003\"\n\n          Then we do: sb.reverse() -> \n             The current string: \" 1 02 003\"\n             Reverse: \n                 We have: [32 characters?] Actually, let's write it: \n                 The string is: space, '1', space, '0','2', space, '0','0','3'\n                 Reverse: '3','0','0',space,'2','0',space,'1',space -> so the string is \"300 20 1 \"? \n\n          But note: there are no extra zeros in the token for 300: it becomes \"300\", and for 20 it becomes \"02\" reversed within the entire string? -> no, within the entire string reversal, the token \"003\" becomes \"300\", and the token \"02\" becomes \"20\", and the token \"1\" becomes \"1\". \n\n          And the order of tokens is reversed: the last token becomes first.\n\n        Therefore, the first program outputs for the second line: \"300 20 1\" (with a trailing space).\n\n        And the second program will read:\n            n = 3\n            v[0] = 300\n            v[1] = 20\n            v[2] = 1\n\n        But the original chain was [1,20,300]. \n\n        So the second program gets the chain in reverse order? and without the digit reversal on the integers? \n\n        Why did the digit reversal within the first program disappear? \n\n        Because the entire string reversal also reversed the digits within the tokens. \n\n        Specifically, for the number 20: \n          First, we reversed its digits to get \"02\", and then when we reversed the entire string, the token \"02\" became the substring from the last character to the first of the token? which is \"20\". \n\n        So the digit reversal on each token is undone by the entire string reversal? \n\n        And for 300: \n          First: we got \"003\", then when reversed, becomes \"300\".\n\n        So the net effect is: \n          The first program outputs the chain in reverse order (last element first) and without any digit reversal (because the per-token digit reversal is undone by the entire string reversal).\n\n        Therefore, we can achieve the same by:\n\n          1. Building the chain in the order of traversal (so the first node is the start, then next, ... until the end).\n          2. Then we reverse the entire chain (so the last node becomes the first, and the first becomes the last).\n          3. Then we output the integers normally (without digit reversal).\n\n        And then we output the integers in the reversed chain order, space separated.\n\n        But note: the first program's output has a trailing space? \n\n        In the example: \"300 20 1 \" -> with a space at the end.\n\n        How did that space appear? \n          The original string was built as: \" 1 02 003\"\n          When reversed, the last character is the space at the beginning, so it becomes the last character: a trailing space.\n\n        In our simulation, if we output the reversed chain (which is [300,20,1]) as:\n\n          printf(\"%d\", chain[0]);\n          for (int i=1; i<ans1; i++) printf(\" %d\", chain[i]);\n          printf(\" \");   // trailing space? \n\n        But the first program did have a trailing space. \n\n        However, the second program uses `sc.next()` which trims spaces. So it doesn't matter.\n\n        But to be identical, we should have a trailing space? \n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically\". \n\n        We can output the integers in the reversed chain order, and then output a space at the end? \n\n        But the example in the first program: the second line is \"300 20 1 \" (with a space at the end).\n\n        In C, we can do:\n\n          printf(\"%d\", chain_reversed[0]);\n          for (int i=1; i<ans1; i++) {\n              printf(\" %d\", chain_reversed[i]);\n          }\n          printf(\" \");   // this would put a space at the end.\n\n        But then we output: \"300 20 1 \"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: what if the chain has only one element? \n          Then we output: \n             printf(\"%d\", chain_reversed[0]);\n             printf(\" \");\n          -> \"1 \"\n\n        In the first program for a chain of one element (say i=1):\n          sss = new StringBuilder(\"1\"); reversed is \"1\"\n          sb = \" 1\"\n          then reverse the entire sb: becomes \"1 \" (because: [' ','1'] -> reversed: ['1',' '])\n\n        So yes, a space at the end.\n\n        Therefore, we can avoid the per-integer digit reversal and simply:\n\n          - Build the chain in the order of traversal (start to end) in an array `path` of length `len`.\n          - Then create a new array `chain_reversed` of length `len` by reversing the entire array `path` (so the last element becomes the first).\n          - Then output the integer `len` and then the array `chain_reversed` as integers with a space after each including a trailing space.\n\n        But note: the first program also has a space at the beginning of the string that was built? and then the entire string reversal moves that space to the end.\n\n        We are effectively doing the same: \n          The chain in `path` is [1,20,300] -> then `chain_reversed` is [300,20,1] -> then we output: \"300 20 1 \"\n\n        This matches the first program's output.\n\n        Therefore, we can bypass the per-integer digit reversal and the entire string reversal by simply reversing the array and then outputting the integers normally (with a space between and a trailing space).\n\n        Steps for the first program in C:\n\n          // Arrays: a[1..n], b[1..n]\n          int *num = (int*)calloc(n+1, sizeof(int));\n          for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) num[b[i]]++;\n\n          int *st = (int*)calloc(n+1, sizeof(int)); // 0: unvisited, 1: visited.\n\n          int ans1 = 0;\n          int *final_chain = NULL; // we will store the final chain (in reversed order of traversal: last element first)\n          int final_chain_length = 0;\n\n          for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n              if (a[i]==1) {\n                  st[i] = 1;\n                  int *path = (int*)malloc(0);\n                  int len = 0;\n\n                  // Start the chain at i\n                  path = (int*)realloc(path, (len+1)*sizeof(int));\n                  path[len++] = i;\n\n                  int x = b[i];\n                  while (x!=0 && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1) {\n                      st[x] = 1;\n                      path = (int*)realloc(path, (len+1)*sizeof(int));\n                      path[len++] = x;\n                      x = b[x];\n                  }\n\n                  // Now, we have a chain of length 'len' in path (from i, then b[i], ...)\n                  // We want to compare with the current best (ans1)\n                  if (len > ans1) {\n                      ans1 = len;\n                      // We will store the chain in reversed order (last element first) for output.\n                      // But note: we will output the entire chain in reversed order (so we reverse the array path)\n                      free(final_chain);\n                      final_chain = (int*)malloc(len * sizeof(int));\n                      for (int j=0; j<len; j++) {\n                          final_chain[j] = path[len-1-j];\n                      }\n                      final_chain_length = len;\n                  }\n                  free(path);\n              }\n          }\n\n          // If no chain found? then ans1 remains 0.

The values in the chain are the original indices (from 1 to n) so they are in [1, n] (<=100000) and our SIZE is 100010, so we are safe.\n\n        However, the frequency arrays vo, ve, vt are indexed by the value in the chain. We are only using indices up to 100000.\n\n        Also, the condition: \n            if (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0])\n        Note: vt[0] is the maximum frequency in the entire array? and vo[0] and ve[0] are the maximum frequencies in the vo and ve arrays.\n\n        This condition is checking if the most frequent value overall is the same as the most frequent value in the even positions and the most frequent value in the odd positions? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            if the sum of the most frequent value in the odd positions and the most frequent value in the even positions equals the most frequent value overall?\n\n        But note: the most frequent value overall might not be the same as the most frequent value in the even and odd positions? \n\n        The Java program's condition: \n            if (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0])\n\n        This is not about the same value, but about the total count.\n\n        Explanation: \n            The maximum frequency in the entire array is vt[0].\n            The maximum frequency in the odd-indexed positions is vo[0] and in the even-indexed positions is ve[0].\n\n            And if vo[0] + ve[0] equals vt[0], that means the most frequent value in the entire array is the same value that is the most frequent in the odd positions and also the same value that is the most frequent in the even positions? \n\n            Actually, not necessarily: it could be that the most frequent value in the odd positions is value A and in the even positions is value B, and then the overall frequency of A is vo[0] and of B is ve[0], and if A and B are different, then the overall frequency of the most frequent value might be max(vo[0], ve[0], ...) and not necessarily vo[0]+ve[0]. \n\n        The condition in the Java program is:\n\n            if (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0])\n\n        This is checking if the sum of the top frequency in the odd positions and the top frequency in the even positions (which might be for two different values) equals the top frequency in the entire array? \n\n        But note: the entire array frequency for a value cannot exceed the frequency in the odd plus the even? \n\n        Actually, the entire array frequency for any value is the sum of its frequency in the odd and even positions. Therefore, the maximum frequency in the entire array is at most the sum of the maximum frequency in the odd and the maximum frequency in the even? \n\n        But they might be for the same value? \n\n        The condition is true if the most frequent value in the entire array is achieved by taking the most frequent value in the odd positions and the most frequent value in the even positions? \n\n        However, the most frequent value in the entire array must be the maximum over x of (vo[x] + ve[x]). Therefore, the maximum value of vo[x]+ve[x] is vt[0]. \n\n        And vo[0] is the maximum over x of vo[x], and ve[0] is the maximum over x of ve[x]. \n\n        But note: the value that achieves vo[0] (say x) and the value that achieves ve[0] (say y) might be different. Then vo[0] + ve[0] is not the frequency of any single value. \n\n        Therefore, the condition (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0]) is not generally true.\n\n        But the Java program does:\n\n            if (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0]) { ... }\n\n        And then uses the next maximum in vo and ve.\n\n        This might be based on the following: \n          If the top frequency in the entire array is exactly the sum of the top frequency in the odd and the top frequency in the even, then it must be that the top frequency in the odd and even are from the same value? \n\n        But that's not necessarily true. \n\n        However, the entire array frequency for any value x is vo[x] + ve[x]. Therefore, the maximum frequency in the entire array is:\n\n            vt[0] = max_{x} (vo[x] + ve[x])\n\n        And vo[0] = max_{x} vo[x], and ve[0] = max_{x} ve[x].\n\n        And we have:\n\n            vt[0] <= vo[0] + ve[0]   (because vo[x]+ve[x] <= vo[0]+ve[0] for any x? but no: vo[x] <= vo[0] and ve[x] <= ve[0], so vo[x]+ve[x] <= vo[0]+ve[0])\n\n        Therefore, vt[0] <= vo[0]+ve[0]. \n\n        And the condition is: if vt[0] == vo[0]+ve[0], then the maximum frequency in the entire array is the sum of the two maximum frequencies in the odd and even arrays? \n\n        But note: this can happen only if the value that achieves vo[0] is the same as the value that achieves ve[0]? Not necessarily: it could be two different values? \n\n        Actually, no: because the entire array frequency of a value is the sum of its own vo and ve. \n\n        Example: \n          Let value A: vo[A]=vo[0] (maximum in vo) and value B: ve[B]=ve[0] (maximum in ve). \n          Then the frequency of A in the entire array is vo[A] + ve[A] <= vo[0] + ve[A] <= vo[0] + ve[0] (because ve[A] <= ve[0]).\n          Similarly, the frequency of B is vo[B] + ve[B] <= vo[0] + ve[0].\n\n          And the condition vt[0] = vo[0]+ve[0] means there exists a value x such that vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0]? \n\n        But wait: we are not guaranteed that the same value x achieves both. \n\n        However, if there is a value x that has vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0], then the frequency of x is vo[0]+ve[0] and that equals vt[0]. \n\n        But what if no value has both? then the maximum frequency in the entire array is less than vo[0]+ve[0]? \n\n        Therefore, the condition (vo[0]+ve[0] == vt[0]) is equivalent to: there exists a value x that is the most frequent in the odd positions and also the most frequent in the even positions? \n\n        But note: it could be that one value has the maximum in the odd positions and a different value has the maximum in the even positions, and then the frequency of the entire array of the most frequent value is less than vo[0]+ve[0]. \n\n        Therefore, the condition is actually: the maximum frequency in the entire array is exactly the sum of the global maximum frequency in the odd and the global maximum frequency in the even? \n\n        And as argued, this implies that there is a value x that has vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0]? \n\n        Why? \n          Let x be the value that achieves vt[0] = vo[x] + ve[x]. \n          Then we have:\n             vo[x] + ve[x] = vt[0] = vo[0] + ve[0]   (by condition)\n\n          And since vo[x] <= vo[0] and ve[x] <= ve[0], the only possibility is vo[x] = vo[0] and ve[x] = ve[0].\n\n        So the condition is true if and only if there is a value x that is the most frequent in the odd positions and the most frequent in the even positions.\n\n        Then the Java program does:\n\n            ans = min(n - vo[0] - ve[1], n - vo[1] - ve[0]);\n\n        Otherwise:\n\n            ans = n - vo[0] - ve[0];\n\n        This matches.\n\n        So we can keep the condition.\n\n        One more note: the arrays vo, ve, vt are sorted in descending order, so vo[0] is the maximum, vo[1] is the next maximum, etc.\n\n        We'll implement as above.\n\n        However, note: the second program in Java uses arrays of size 100010, and we are using SIZE=100010.\n\n        Also, the second program in Java uses:\n\n            Integer[] vo = new Integer[100010];\n            similarly for ve and vt.\n\n            Then they fill with 0.\n\n            Then they sort: \n                Arrays.sort(vo, Collections.reverseOrder());\n\n            But note: the array vo is an array of integers, and after sorting in reverse order, vo[0] is the maximum, vo[1] is the next, etc.\n\n            We do the same with qsort in descending order.\n\n        But note: the entire array is of size 100010, and we initialized with zeros. After sorting, the zeros will be at the end? and the non-zero frequencies will be at the front? \n\n        But the qsort will sort the entire array, so we get the frequencies in descending order. The zeros will be at the end.\n\n        This is the same as the Java program.\n\n        Therefore, we are good.\n\n        Let me test with a small example:\n\n          First program: \n            n=3, a = [?,?,?], b = [?,?,?] -> but we don't care, we assume we have computed the chain.\n\n          Suppose the chain is [300,20,1] for n2=3.\n\n          Then the second program:\n\n            v2 = [300,20,1]\n\n            Then:\n              i=0 (even): \n                  ve[300]++, vt[300]++\n              i=1 (odd):\n                  vo[20]++, vt[20]++\n              i=2 (even):\n                  ve[1]++, vt[1]++\n\n            Then vo: \n                vo[20]=1, others 0 -> sorted: [1,0,0,...]\n            ve: \n                ve[300]=1, ve[1]=1 -> sorted: [1,1,0,0,...]\n            vt: \n                vt[300]=1, vt[20]=1, vt[1]=1 -> sorted: [1,1,1,0,...] -> so vt[0]=1, vt[1]=1, vt[2]=1.\n\n            Now, condition: vo[0]+ve[0] = 1+1 = 2, and vt[0]=1 -> not equal.\n\n            So ans2 = n2 - vo[0] - ve[0] = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1.\n\n          Output: 1.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        We'll write the C program accordingly.\n\n        Edge: if n2=0, then the second program:\n\n          vo, ve, vt: all zeros.\n          vo[0]=0, ve[0]=0, vt[0]=0 -> condition: 0+0==0 -> true.\n          then ans2 = min(0 - 0 - ve[1], 0 - vo[1] - 0) = min( - ve[1], - vo[1]) -> which is negative? \n\n        But the Java program for n2=0:\n\n          The arrays vo, ve, vt are all zeros. Then:\n\n            vo[0] = 0, ve[0]=0, vt[0]=0 -> condition true.\n\n            Then it computes:\n               n - vo[0] - ve[1] = 0 - 0 - ve[1] \n            But what is ve[1]? the array ve is of zeros, and sorted in descending order, so ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0.\n\n            So option1 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0, option2 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n            Then ans2 = min(0,0)=0.\n\n        In C, we do:\n\n          ans2 = min(0 - 0 - ve[1], 0 - vo[1] - 0) \n          = min( - ve[1], - vo[1] )\n\n        But what is ve[1]? in the sorted array, after sorting, ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0, ... so ve[1]=0.\n\n        Then we get min(0,0)=0.\n\n        But note: our qsort sorts the entire array, and the array is initialized to zeros, so after sorting, the entire array is zeros? \n\n        Actually, we are sorting the entire array of SIZE=100010, and the array is all zeros. Then after sorting in descending order, it's still all zeros? \n\n        Then vo[0]=0, vo[1]=0, ve[0]=0, ve[1]=0.\n\n        So we compute:\n\n          option1 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n          option2 = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n          ans2 = 0.\n\n        So we output 0.\n\n        That's correct.\n\n        Therefore, the C program is as below.\n\n        Note: We must be cautious about the memory allocation for the chain and the path.\n\n        Also, note: the first program condition in the while loop: \n            while (x != 0 && x>=1 && x<=n && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1)\n\n        We added bounds check for x (x>=1 and x<=n) because st and a are defined only for 1..n.\n\n        Also, note: the frequency array `num` is defined for 0..n. The value 0 is allowed? \n\n        The first program: \n            while (x != 0 && ...)\n\n        So if x==0, we break. \n\n        We'll assume that b[i] can be 0.\n\n        Now, we write the final C program.\n\n        Let me test with a small chain.\n\n        However, due to complexity, we rely on the above.\n\n        Code:"
