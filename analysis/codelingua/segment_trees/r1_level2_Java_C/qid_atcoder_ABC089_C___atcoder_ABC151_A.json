Alternatively, we can convert the number to a string in a buffer and then take the first character. Since the number has at most 20 digits, we can safely do:\n\n      char buffer[30];\n      sprintf(buffer, \"%ld\", res);\n      char first_char = buffer[0];\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the number and then the second program reads that number as a string.

But in our case, the first character of a decimal number is between '0' and '9', and adding 1 gives a value in the range 49 to 58 (if the character is '0' (48) then becomes 49 which is '1'; '1' becomes '2', ... '9' becomes 57+1=58 which is ':'). So we are safe. But note: what if the result is a very large number?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC089_C):\n  - Reads an integer `n` and then `n` strings.\n  - Counts the number of strings that start with one of the letters: 'M', 'A', 'R', 'C', 'H'.\n  - Then it computes the sum of the products of all combinations of three distinct counts (i.e., the combinations of the 5 counts taken 3 at a time).\n  - Outputs the result.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a string `s`.\n  - Outputs the next character (the character that is one ASCII value higher than the first character of the input string).\n\nHowever, note that the output of the first program is a long integer and the second program expects a string as input. This seems incompatible.\n\nBut the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, the output of the first program (a long integer) becomes the input to the second program. However, the second program expects a string. How do we reconcile?\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads a string and then prints the next character. If the input to the second program is a number (from the first program), then we must convert that number to a string (as the second program expects a string). But note the second program only uses the first character of the input string.\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input to the entire sequence: the input for the first program (an integer n and then n strings).\n  Output of the first program: a long integer (say, `res`).\n  Input to the second program: the string representation of `res`.\n  Output of the second program: the character that is one higher than the first character of the string representation of `res`.\n\nBut wait: the first program's output is a number, and the second program reads that number as a string. Then it takes the first character of that string and adds 1 to it (in terms of ASCII) and prints that character.\n\nHowever, the example input for the first program might be:\n  3\n  M\n  A\n  R\n\nThen the first program counts:\n  M:1, A:1, R:1 -> the other counts (C and H) are 0.\n  Then the result is: 1*1*1 + ... (but note: only the combination [M, A, R] is non-zero, so the result is 1).\n\nThen the input to the second program is the string \"1\". The first character is '1'. Then we output the next character: '2'.\n\nBut what if the output of the first program is a multi-digit number? The second program only uses the first character.\n\nTherefore, we must combine the two programs as follows:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (an integer n and then n strings).\n2. Process the counts and compute `res` (the long integer from the first program).\n3. Convert `res` to a string (this becomes the input to the second program).\n4. Take the first character of that string, add 1 to it (as an ASCII character), and output the resulting character.\n\nHowever, note the second program only outputs a single character (using `printf(\"%c\", ...)`).\n\nBut wait: the second program does not output a newline? Actually, in the second program, it uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)`. This will output a single character without a newline. However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The original chain would output a single character.\n\nBut note: the first program does output a newline (because it uses `out.println(res);`). Then the second program reads the entire line (using `r.readLine()`) which would read the entire number string (including the newline? Actually, `readLine()` in Java reads without including the newline). However, the second program then takes the first character of that string (without the newline) and outputs the next character.\n\nBut in our C program, we are going to avoid I/O in the middle. So we must:\n\n  - Read the initial input (n and the n strings) and store them.\n  - Compute the first program's result (the long integer).\n  - Then pass that result to the second program by converting it to a string (without actually printing it) and then take the first character of that string, add 1, and then output that character.\n\nHowever, note: the second program does not use the entire string, only the first character. So we don't need to build the entire string if the number is very big? But the result of the first program is at most 10^15 (since n is at most 10^5, and each count is at most 10^5, and the product of three counts is at most 10^15, which is 16 digits). So we can safely convert to a string.\n\nBut note: what if the result is 0? Then the string is \"0\", then the next character is '1'.\n\nBut what if the result is negative? The problem states that the counts are nonnegative, and the result is a sum of products of three nonnegative numbers, so it is nonnegative.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n2. For i from 0 to n-1, read a string (each string is one word, and we only care about the first character).\n3. Count the occurrences of the first letter being one of 'M','A','R','C','H'.\n4. Compute the result as the sum of all combinations of three distinct counts (from the five counts). There are 10 combinations: C(5,3)=10.\n5. Convert the result (a long integer) to a string. Let this string be `s`.\n6. If the string is empty (which shouldn't happen because the result is at least 0, and 0 is represented as \"0\"), then we have a character to process. Otherwise, take the first character of `s`.\n7. Output the character that is the next one in the ASCII table (so if the first character is 'a', output 'b').\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the integer and then a newline. The second program reads the entire line (so the entire number and the newline? Actually, `readLine()` in Java does not include the newline). Then it takes the first character of the string (without the newline) and adds 1.\n\nTherefore, we must note that the second program does not see the newline because `readLine()` consumes the entire line without including the newline. So the string passed to the second program is the string representation of the number.\n\nIn C, we can convert the long integer to a string using `sprintf` (or we can use a function to convert to string). However, we are going to avoid I/O in the middle, so we will do:\n\n  Step 5: convert the long integer to a string (without printing it). We can use a buffer.\n\nBut note: the second program only uses the first character. So we can avoid building the entire string if we only need the first digit? However, we must consider: what if the number is 0? Then we need the digit '0'. Also, what if the number is 10? Then the string is \"10\", and the first character is '1'. The next character is '2'.\n\nBut note: the number might be very large and have multiple digits, but we only need the first digit.\n\nHowever, we cannot avoid converting the entire number to a string because we don't know the first digit without knowing the entire number? Actually, we can get the most significant digit by doing:\n\n  If the number is 0 -> digit '0'\n  Otherwise, we can compute the number of digits and then the first digit by: \n      while (num >= 10) num /= 10; \n  but then we get the most significant digit as a single digit. However, note: the string representation of the number is in base-10. But what if the number is negative? We said it's nonnegative.\n\nBut wait: the second program uses the entire string as read by `readLine()`, but then only the first character. However, the string representation of a number in Java for a long is the standard decimal representation without any formatting (so no leading zeros, no commas, etc.). And the second program takes the first character of that string.\n\nBut note: what if the number has a leading zero? Actually, the number is nonnegative and if it is zero then the string is \"0\". Otherwise, it doesn't have leading zeros.\n\nSo we can get the first digit without building the entire string? Actually, we can, but we have to be cautious for the zero case.\n\nHowever, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The second program uses the entire string that was printed by the first program (without the trailing newline) and then takes the first character. The first program prints the number without any formatting (just `println`). So the string is the same as what you get from `Long.toString(res)`.\n\nBut note: the first program might output the number in scientific notation? No, because the number is at most 10^15 (which is 16 digits) and Java prints long integers in decimal.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  If `res` is 0, then the first character is '0'.\n  Else, we can compute the first digit by:\n\n      int num_digits = (int)floor(log10(res)) + 1;\n      long first_digit = res / pow(10, num_digits-1);\n\n  But this might be error-prone due to floating point and also for the case when res is 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert the number to a string in a buffer and then take the first character. Since the number has at most 20 digits, we can safely do:\n\n      char buffer[30];\n      sprintf(buffer, \"%ld\", res);\n      char first_char = buffer[0];\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the number and then the second program reads that number as a string. The second program does not know the number of digits, so it reads the entire line. However, we only need the first character.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  Step 5: Convert the long integer `res` to a string. Then take the first character of that string.\n\n  Step 6: Output the character that is `first_char + 1`. But note: in C, if `first_char` is '9', then adding 1 gives ':'? But in the second Java program, it does `s.charAt(0) + 1` which is an integer addition (because `char` is a 16-bit integer in Java) and then prints as a character. So in C, we do the same: we add 1 to the character.\n\nHowever, note: the Java program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`. The expression `s.charAt(0) + 1` is an integer that is then cast to a char? Actually, the type of the expression is `int` (because adding a char and an int in Java gives an int). Then it is printed as a character? But the `%c` format in `printf` expects an integer that is then converted to an unsigned char. So if the result is beyond 255, it might be truncated? But in our case, the first character of a decimal number is between '0' and '9', and adding 1 gives a value in the range 49 to 58 (if the character is '0' (48) then becomes 49 which is '1'; '1' becomes '2', ... '9' becomes 57+1=58 which is ':'). So we are safe.\n\nBut note: what if the result is a very large number? The first character might be a digit from '1' to '9'. So the next character is in the range '2' to ':'.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  - Reads the integer n.\n  - Then reads n words (each word is a string, but we only care about the first character).\n  - Counts the five letters.\n  - Computes the 10 combinations of the five counts taken three at a time (if a count is zero, then that product is zero).\n  - Then, we convert the result (a long) to a string and take the first character.\n  - Then, we output the character that is the first character plus one.\n\nBut note: the original first program does not count any other letters. Only the ones that start with M, A, R, C, H.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll read n, then n words. We can use `scanf` for that.\n\n  We'll have an array `cnt` of 5 longs, initialized to 0.\n\n  For each word, we read it and check the first character. Then update the corresponding count.\n\n  Then compute:\n\n      res = 0;\n      // We have indices 0,1,2,3,4 for M,A,R,C,H.\n      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n          for (int j = i+1; j < 5; j++) {\n              for (int k = j+1; k < 5; k++) {\n                  res += cnt[i] * cnt[j] * cnt[k];\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  Then, convert `res` to a string.\n\n  But note: what if `res` is zero? Then we get the string \"0\", and the first character is '0'. Then output '1'.\n\n  However, we can do:\n\n      char str[21]; // enough for 20 digits and null\n      sprintf(str, \"%ld\", res);\n      char c = str[0];\n      putchar(c+1);\n\n  But note: the second program does not output a newline? Actually, the second program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not output a newline. So we output a single character and then the program exits.\n\n  However, the problem says the entire sequence. The original chain: the first program outputs a number and then a newline. Then the second program outputs a single character (without a newline). So the overall output is:\n\n        [number]\\n[one character]\n\n  But wait: in the chain, the output of the first program is the input to the second program. So the second program reads the number and the newline? Actually, the `readLine()` in the second program reads until a newline and discards the newline. So the string that the second program gets is the number without the newline. Then it outputs a character without a newline.\n\n  However, in our combined program, we are avoiding I/O in the middle. Therefore, we are not actually printing the number and then reading it. We are converting the number to a string and then processing the first character. Then we output the next character. And we do not output the newline that the first program originally output? The problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and the last block is the second program which outputs a single character without a newline.\n\n  But the first program's output (the number and the newline) is not actually output? We are skipping that. Instead, we are using the number to compute the next character. So the entire output of the combined program is just the single character (without a newline) that the second program outputs.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n  The original chain:\n\n      Input: \n          3\n          M\n          A\n          R\n\n      Output of first program: \"1\\n\"\n      Then the second program is run with input \"1\\n\", and it reads the entire line (so it gets the string \"1\", without the newline) and outputs '2'. Then the second program exits.\n\n      So the overall output of the chain is: \"1\\n2\"\n\n  But wait, the second program outputs a single character without a newline, so the overall output is:\n\n        \"1\\n2\"\n\n  But when we run the combined program, we do:\n\n        Read the input: 3, then \"M\", \"A\", \"R\".\n        Compute res=1.\n        Then we output the next character of the first digit of the string \"1\", which is '2'.\n\n        So the combined program outputs '2' without a newline.\n\n  This is different from the chain? Because the chain outputs \"1\\n2\", but the combined program outputs only \"2\".\n\n  This discrepancy is because the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output (which is \"1\\n\") is fed as the input to the second program. But the second program only uses the first character (which is '1') and outputs '2'. However, the newline from the first program is consumed by the second program's `readLine()` (which stops at the newline and discards it). So the newline does not appear in the second program's output.\n\n  But the overall output of the chain is:\n\n        The first program's output: \"1\\n\"\n        The second program's output: \"2\"\n\n        So if we run the chain in a shell, we would see:\n\n            $ ... | ...\n            1\n            2$\n\n        But note: the second program's output does not have a newline, so the shell prompt might appear immediately after the 2.\n\n  However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The combined program should output the same as the entire chain: that is, the output of the first program and then the output of the second program? But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and the output of the entire sequence is the output of the last program.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that the combined program should only output at the end. And the output of the entire sequence is the output of the last program? Actually, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning that for the same input, the combined program should produce the same output as the entire chain.\n\n  The entire chain's output is the output of the second program? Or the concatenation of the outputs of both?\n\n  The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", so the output of the first program is not part of the final output? It is only passed to the next program. The final output is the output of the last program.\n\n  Therefore, the combined program should only output what the last program outputs: a single character without a newline.\n\n  So the example input:\n\n        3\n        M\n        A\n        R\n\n  should produce the output:\n\n        2\n\n  without a newline.\n\n  But note: the first program's output (the number and the newline) is not part of the final output? It is an intermediate and is consumed by the second program. Therefore, the combined program should only output the result of the second program.\n\n  Therefore, we do not output the number and the newline. We only output the single character at the end.\n\n  This matches the problem requirement: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n  However, this might be confusing because the first program originally does output. But the problem says to avoid I/O in the middle.\n\n  So the plan:\n\n      Read n and the n strings.\n      Compute the counts for the five letters.\n      Compute the result (res) as the sum of the products of the five counts taken three at a time.\n      Convert res to a string and take the first character (if the string is empty, we have a problem, but res is nonnegative so we have at least the string \"0\").\n      Output the character that is the first character plus one (without a newline).\n\n  But note: what if the result is 0? Then we output '1' (because '0'+1 = '1').\n\n  Example: if the result is 123, then the first character is '1', so we output '2'.\n\n  Now, let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: The second program only reads one line. The first program outputs one integer and then a newline. So the entire output of the first program is one line. Therefore, the second program reads that one line. So we only need the first character of the string representation of the number (without the newline).\n\n  However, what if the number has multiple digits? We only take the first digit.\n\n  But note: the second program does:\n\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0)+1);\n\n  So it does not matter if the number has more digits: it only uses the first one.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n  Steps in C:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n          // We'll have an array of 5 long integers for the counts: M, A, R, C, H.\n          long cnt[5] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              char s[100]; // assuming the string length is at most 99\n              scanf(\"%s\", s);\n              if (s[0] == 'M') cnt[0]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'A') cnt[1]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'R') cnt[2]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'C') cnt[3]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'H') cnt[4]++;\n          }\n\n          long res = 0;\n          // We have 5 indices: 0,1,2,3,4. We want to take every combination of three distinct indices.\n          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n              for (int j = i+1; j < 5; j++) {\n                  for (int k = j+1; k < 5; k++) {\n                      res += cnt[i] * cnt[j] * cnt[k];\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now, convert res to a string and get the first character.\n          char buf[30]; // enough for 20 digits\n          sprintf(buf, \"%ld\", res);\n          char first_char = buf[0];\n          // If res was 0, then buf is \"0\", so first_char is '0'.\n          // Then we output the next character: first_char + 1.\n          putchar(first_char + 1);\n\n          // Note: we do not output a newline.\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, note: the second program does not output a newline, so we do not output one.\n\n  But wait: what if the result is a negative number? We said it can't be. The counts are nonnegative, so the products are nonnegative.\n\n  But what about overflow? The problem says n can be up to 10^5. The counts for each letter can be at most 10^5. The maximum product for one triplet is 10^15, and there are 10 triplets, so the total is at most 10^16, which is within the range of a long (which is at least 64 bits, so up to about 9e18). So it is safe.\n\n  However, we are using `%ld` for a long. But note: the type of `res` is long. We must use `long` for the counts and the result.\n\n  But what if we are on a system where long is 32 bits? Then 10^16 might overflow. The problem says the original Java program used long. In C, we can use `long long` to be safe.\n\n  Since the problem says to run on the same input, and the original Java program uses 64-bit integers (long in Java is 64-bit), we should use a 64-bit integer in C.\n\n  Let's change:\n\n      long cnt[5] -> long long cnt[5]\n      long res -> long long res\n\n  And then use `%lld` in sprintf? But note: the problem says the original program used `long` in Java, which is 64-bit.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use `long` and hope that it is 64-bit? But the C standard does not guarantee that. We can use `long long` to be safe.\n\n  Also, the format specifier for `long long` is `%lld`.\n\n  Therefore, we adjust:\n\n      long long cnt[5] = {0};\n      long long res = 0;\n\n      ...\n\n      sprintf(buf, \"%lld\", res);\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the platform. We want portability? The problem says \"behaves identically\", so we assume the numbers are 64-bit.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use `int` for the counts? The maximum count is 10^5, which is 100000, and the product of three such counts is 1e15, which fits in a 64-bit integer. But we cannot use `int` for the result.\n\n  We'll use `long long` for the counts and the result.\n\n  However, the indices and n are integers (n up to 100000, which fits in an `int`).\n\n  Revised code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n          long long cnt[5] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // M, A, R, C, H\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              char s[101]; // 100 characters plus null\n              scanf(\"%100s\", s); // limit to 100 to avoid overflow\n\n              if (s[0] == 'M') cnt[0]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'A') cnt[1]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'R') cnt[2]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'C') cnt[3]++;\n              else if (s[0] == 'H') cnt[4]++;\n          }\n\n          long long res = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n              for (int j = i+1; j < 5; j++) {\n                  for (int k = j+1; k < 5; k++) {\n                      res += cnt[i] * cnt[j] * cnt[k];\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          char buf[30];\n          sprintf(buf, \"%lld\", res);\n          char first_char = buf[0];\n          putchar(first_char + 1);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: what if the result is 0? Then we output '1'. This is correct.\n\n  However, what if the result is negative? It shouldn't be, but if it is, the `sprintf` will put a minus sign. Then the first character would be '-'. Then we output '-' + 1, which is '/' (ASCII 47) but that's not a digit? The problem says the result is nonnegative, so we are safe.\n\n  We'll assume the input constraints.\n\n  Also, note: the first character of the string representation of a negative number is '-'. But the problem states nonnegative, so we ignore.\n\n  Let's test with the example: n=3, strings: \"M\", \"A\", \"R\". Then:\n\n      cnt[0] = 1 (M), cnt[1]=1 (A), cnt[2]=1 (R), the others 0.\n      Then the combinations that are non-zero: only (0,1,2) -> 1*1*1 = 1.\n      Then res = 1.\n      Then the string is \"1\", so first_char = '1', then output '2'.\n\n  So the output is the character '2' (without newline).\n\n  But the original chain outputs:\n\n      First program: \"1\\n\"\n      Second program: '2'\n\n  And then the second program exits. The overall output is \"1\\n2\", but the combined program only outputs \"2\". \n\n  However, the problem says: the entire sequence. And the output of the entire sequence is the output of the last program? Yes, because the first program's output is consumed by the second program. The final output that the user sees is only the output of the second program.\n\n  Therefore, the combined program should output only the character that the second program outputs.\n\n  So we are correct.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are only outputting the character at the end.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the entire sequence. The original chain has two outputs: the first program outputs to stdout and then the second program reads from stdin and then outputs to stdout. The combined program does not have the intermediate I/O. So the output of the entire sequence is the output of the second program.\n\n  Therefore, the combined program should output only the single character.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  But note: what if there are no strings starting with M, A, R, C, H? Then res=0, and we output '1'. That matches.\n\n  Edge: n=0 -> all counts are 0 -> res=0 -> output '1'.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the input reading. The first program uses a Scanner that reads tokens (with next() for each string). So we read each string as a token. We assume there are no spaces in the string? The problem says: \"n strings\", each string is one word.\n\n  We use `scanf(\"%100s\", s)` which reads a word (non-whitespace sequence). This matches.\n\n  Final code:"
