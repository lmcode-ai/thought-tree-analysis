The second program expects multiple tokens until one of them is \"0\". How does the chain work? Example:\n\n   Step 1 input: \n        n = 3\n        numbers: 10, -10, 0\n\n   Step 1 computation:\n        cnt[10+10] = cnt[20] -> becomes 1\n        cnt[-10+10] = cnt[0] -> becomes 1\n        cnt[0+10] = cnt[10] -> becomes 1\n        Then: i from 0 to 9: \n            i=0: cnt[0]*cnt[20] = 1*1 = 1\n            ... until i=9: cnt[9]*cnt[11] -> 0\n          plus: cnt[10]*(cnt[10]-1)/2 = 1*0/2 = 0 So res = 1. Step 1 output: 1\n\n   Now Step 2 input: the string \"1\"\n\n   Step 2: Split the string \"1\" -> array of one string: [\"1\"]\n        Then iterate: \n            result = 1 -> then check if \"1\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> then next? But wait, the loop breaks only when it finds \"0\". In this array, there is no \"0\". So the loop runs to the end? Then what is the output? The program counts the tokens until it finds a \"0\". Since it doesn't find one, it would output the total number of tokens? But the code:\n\n            for (String str : input_array) {\n                result += 1;   // Actually, this is incorrect: the code does:\n                    // result starts at 0, then for the first token: result becomes 1, then if the token is \"0\", break.\n            } Actually, the code in the second program:\n\n            int result = 0;\n            for (String str : input_array) {\n                result += 1;\n                if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n            } So if the array is [\"1\"], then:\n            result becomes 1, then check if \"1\" is \"0\"? no -> then next token? There is none -> loop ends. Then output: 1. But if the array was [\"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\"] then:\n            first token: result=1 -> not break -> second token: result=2 -> not break -> third token: result=3 -> and then break?

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one C program.\n\n The first program (codeforces_131_B):\n   - Reads an integer `n`.\n   - Then reads `n` integers. For each integer `x`, it increments `cnt[x+10]` (where the array `cnt` is of size 21).\n   - Then it computes:\n        for i from 0 to 9: res += cnt[i] * cnt[20-i]\n        plus res += (cnt[10] * (cnt[10]-1))/2\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A):\n   - Reads a line of space-separated strings until it finds the string \"0\", then outputs the index (starting count at 1) of that \"0\".\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is a single number (a long) and that becomes the input to the second program.\n\n But wait: the second program expects a line of space-separated strings. How do we reconcile?\n\n Actually, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n The first program outputs a single number (the value of `res`). The second program then reads a line of space-separated strings. \n\n However, the second program is written to read until it finds a \"0\". So if the first program outputs, say, \"5\", then the second program would read the string \"5\", and then look for a \"0\" and not find it? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Let me reexamine the chain:\n\n Input for the first program: \n   The first integer is `n`, then `n` integers.\n\n Output of the first program: one integer (the value of `res`).\n\n Then the second program takes that integer (as a string) and splits it by space? But there are no spaces. The second program expects multiple tokens until one of them is \"0\".\n\n How does the chain work?\n\n Example:\n\n   Step 1 input: \n        n = 3\n        numbers: 10, -10, 0\n\n   Step 1 computation:\n        cnt[10+10] = cnt[20] -> becomes 1\n        cnt[-10+10] = cnt[0] -> becomes 1\n        cnt[0+10] = cnt[10] -> becomes 1\n        Then:\n          i from 0 to 9: \n            i=0: cnt[0]*cnt[20] = 1*1 = 1\n            ... until i=9: cnt[9]*cnt[11] -> 0\n          plus: cnt[10]*(cnt[10]-1)/2 = 1*0/2 = 0\n        So res = 1.\n\n   Step 1 output: 1\n\n   Now Step 2 input: the string \"1\"\n\n   Step 2: \n        Split the string \"1\" -> array of one string: [\"1\"]\n        Then iterate: \n            result = 1 -> then check if \"1\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> then next?\n        But wait, the loop breaks only when it finds \"0\". In this array, there is no \"0\". So the loop runs to the end? Then what is the output?\n\n        The program counts the tokens until it finds a \"0\". Since it doesn't find one, it would output the total number of tokens? But the code:\n\n            for (String str : input_array) {\n                result += 1;   // Actually, this is incorrect: the code does:\n                    // result starts at 0, then for the first token: result becomes 1, then if the token is \"0\", break.\n            }\n\n        Actually, the code in the second program:\n\n            int result = 0;\n            for (String str : input_array) {\n                result += 1;\n                if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n            }\n\n        So if the array is [\"1\"], then:\n            result becomes 1, then check if \"1\" is \"0\"? no -> then next token? There is none -> loop ends.\n\n        Then output: 1.\n\n        But if the array was [\"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\"] then:\n            first token: result=1 -> not break -> second token: result=2 -> not break -> third token: result=3 -> and then break? Then output 3.\n\n        However, the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program gets the string \"1\" (without any spaces). \n\n        Therefore, the second program will output 1.\n\n        So the entire chain: input to the first program (the numbers) produces the output 1, then the second program outputs 1.\n\n        But what if the first program outputs 0? Then the second program would read \"0\", then at the first token: set result=1 and break -> output 1.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence of programs. The first program's output becomes the input string of the second.\n\n        How do we combine?\n\n        We have to simulate:\n\n          Step 1: read the initial input (which is for the first program) and compute the number `res1`.\n          Then, without printing, we pass `res1` as a string to the second program? But note: the second program expects a line of tokens.\n\n        However, the second program is written to read a line and split by space. We have only one token: the string representation of `res1`.\n\n        Then the second program will count the tokens until it finds a \"0\". But note: the token might be the string \"0\", then we break at the first token.\n\n        The second program's output is the index (starting at 1) of the token that is \"0\", but if we break at the first token that is \"0\", then the output is that index (which is 1).\n\n        But what if the token is not \"0\"? Then we just have one token, so the output is 1.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will always output 1? Because there is only one token and regardless of whether it is \"0\" or not, we count it and then break if it's \"0\", but the count is already 1.\n\n        However, let me check:\n\n          If the token is \"0\": \n            result starts at 0.\n            first token: result becomes 1, then check: \"0\" equals \"0\" -> break -> output 1.\n\n          If the token is not \"0\":\n            result becomes 1, then the loop continues? But there are no more tokens. So output 1.\n\n        So the second program always outputs 1? \n\n        But that cannot be the intended behavior of the second program in isolation. The example in the second program's code:\n\n          The problem: \n            \"Five variables x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 are given. They are integers between 0 and 10. \n             Write a program which prints the index i such that xi=0.\"\n\n          Example input: \"0 2 3 4 5\" -> output: 1.\n\n          Another: \"1 2 0 4 5\" -> output: 3.\n\n        How does the chain work then? The first program outputs a single number. The second program is expecting a list of five numbers? \n\n        There is a mismatch.\n\n        The problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        The first program outputs one integer. The second program, when run in isolation, expects 5 numbers. But in the chain, it is getting one number.\n\n        This chain is not coherent.\n\n        However, note the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n        And \"the same behavior\" meaning: when the entire chain is run on the original input (which is the input of the first program), the output should be the same as running the two programs in sequence.\n\n        But the second program in isolation would break if it didn't get five numbers? Actually, the second program reads a line and splits by space, and then iterates over the tokens until it finds a \"0\". It doesn't require five tokens. It can have any number of tokens.\n\n        However, the original input for the second program is a line of tokens. But in the chain, the input for the second program is the output of the first, which is one token.\n\n        So the chain:\n\n          Input to the entire system: the input for the first program (n and then n integers)\n\n          Output of the entire system: the output of the second program (which is the index of the first occurrence of \"0\" in the tokens of the second program's input, and the second program's input is the string representation of the first program's output)\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain's output is always 1? Because the second program gets one token and:\n\n          If that token is \"0\", then the index is 1 (and break).\n          If that token is not \"0\", then we count the first token (so output 1) and then there are no more.\n\n        So the output of the entire chain is always 1? \n\n        But that does not match the example above: \n          First program input: 3 numbers: 10, -10, 0 -> first program outputs 1 -> second program outputs 1.\n\n        However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then the second program would get the string \"0\", and output 1.\n\n        So regardless, the output is 1.\n\n        This seems absurd. But let me check the original programs:\n\n        First program: It counts pairs (i, j) such that a[i] + a[j] == 0? Actually, it counts pairs of numbers that are negatives of each other, and zeros.\n\n        The output is the total number of such pairs.\n\n        Then the second program: given a list of numbers (which in the chain is one number: the total pairs), it outputs the position of the first zero? But that one number is the total pairs, which might be zero or non-zero.\n\n        And then the second program always outputs 1? \n\n        Therefore, the entire chain's output is always 1.\n\n        But wait: the second program in the chain is being given a single number. The second program is designed for a problem that has five numbers. But the code we have for the second program doesn't require five numbers. It will process as many tokens as there are until it finds a \"0\", and then output the count (which is the position) at which it found the zero.\n\n        Since the input to the second program is the string of the first program's output, and that string has one token, then:\n\n          If the first program's output is 0 -> the token is \"0\", then the second program outputs 1 (because at the first token we break and the count is 1).\n\n          If the first program's output is 1 -> the token is \"1\", then the second program outputs 1 (because we count the first token and then there are no more).\n\n        So indeed, the output is always 1.\n\n        This is the behavior of the chain.\n\n        However, note that the second program in the original (atcoder_ABC170_A) is designed for a problem with exactly five numbers. But the code we have does not assume five numbers. It works for any number of tokens until the first zero.\n\n        So in the chain, the second program is getting one token. Therefore, the entire chain's output is always 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can write a C program that:\n\n          Step 1: Read the initial input (n and then n integers) and compute the value `res` as in the first program.\n\n          Step 2: Since the second program always outputs 1 regardless of the value of `res`, we can simply output 1.\n\n        But wait: what if the first program outputs a number that has multiple digits? The string representation might have multiple tokens? \n\n        Actually, the first program outputs the number as a single token. For example, if `res` is 10, then the output is the string \"10\", which is one token (without spaces). So the second program sees one token: \"10\".\n\n        Then the second program: \n          token array: [\"10\"]\n          then: \n            result=0\n            first token: result becomes 1, then check if \"10\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> then the loop ends -> output 1.\n\n        So indeed, the second program always outputs 1.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain can be simplified to:\n\n          Read the initial input (n and n integers), do the computation (which we can skip if we don't care about the result, but we do have to read the input to avoid breaking) and then output 1.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must read the input exactly as the first program does, and then output 1.\n\n        But what if the first program has side effects? It doesn't. So we can skip the computation? Actually, we have to read the integers to avoid leaving data in the input buffer? But the problem says the entire chain. And the second program in the chain is reading the output of the first, not the original input.\n\n        However, the first program must read the input. So we must read the same input.\n\n        Therefore, the C program:\n\n          Step 1: Read integer n.\n          Step 2: Read n integers (but we don't need to store them? Actually, the first program uses them to update an array of counters. But we don't care about the result because the second program always outputs 1. However, we must read them to avoid affecting the next program? But in the chain, the first program consumes the input, so we must too.\n\n          But note: the second program in the chain does not read the original input. It reads the output of the first program. So the entire input is consumed by the first program.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          Then output 1.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain:\n\n          Program1: reads n and n integers, computes a result and outputs it (say, 5).\n          Program2: reads the string \"5\", and outputs 1.\n\n        So the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n        Therefore, our C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int n;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  int x;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n              }\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n        But wait: what if the first program's output is used as the input to the second? We are not using it. We are just reading the initial input and then outputting 1. This is acceptable because the second program's output is always 1.\n\n        However, what if the first program's output is a very large number? The second program would still output 1. So we are safe.\n\n        But let me check the first program: it uses an array `cnt` of 21 elements. It adds 10 to each input. The input integers are in the range [-10,10]? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but the array index is from 0 to 20. If an input is less than -10 or greater than 10, then we get an index out of bounds? \n\n        However, the problem statement of the first program (codeforces 131 B) says: \"The only line contains integers between -10 and 10, inclusive.\" So we are safe.\n\n        But the problem says: the entire chain. We are not required to validate the input.\n\n        However, to be faithful, we might have to compute the same `res` as the first program? But note: the second program doesn't use `res` for anything except to check if it is \"0\", and we are always outputting 1. So we don't need to compute `res`.\n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is: read the initial input, then output 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the computation of `res`.\n\n        However, what if the first program crashes on invalid input? We are not doing the same. But the problem states the programs are meant to be executed in sequence. We assume valid input.\n\n        But to be safe and faithful, we should compute the `res` exactly as in the first program? Why? Because the problem says \"the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program is to compute `res` and output it. The second program then uses that output. However, the second program's output is always 1. So the chain's output is 1 regardless of `res`.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the computation.\n\n        However, note: the first program might have side effects? It only allocates an array and does arithmetic. So no side effects.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal program is as above.\n\n        But wait: what if the first program's output is so large that it takes more than one character? The second program still sees one token. So we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and we are not.\n\n        But the problem also says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and we are reading the input only at the beginning. And \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are producing the output at the end.\n\n        So the above program meets the criteria.\n\n        However, let me reexamine the chain: the second program is atcoder_ABC170_A. The problem it solves is: \n          \"We have five variables x1,...,x5. Find the index i such that xi=0.\"\n\n        But in the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first program. So the second program is being used in a way that doesn't match its original problem. But the problem says: we are given these two programs and we chain them.\n\n        Therefore, we output 1.\n\n        But what if the first program outputs a string with multiple tokens? For example, if the first program output \"1 2 3\", then the second program would see three tokens and output 3 if one of them is \"0\"? But the first program only outputs one integer. So the output is a single token.\n\n        Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n        However, to be absolutely safe and to mimic the chain exactly (even if the second program's behavior changes in the future with different inputs), we can compute the first program's result and then run the second program's logic on the string representation of that result.\n\n        But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We cannot print and then read in the same program.\n\n        We have to simulate:\n\n          Step 1: Compute `res1` (the result of the first program).\n          Step 2: Convert `res1` to a string (without printing) and then split that string by spaces? But there are no spaces. Then we have one token.\n\n          Then we run the second program's logic on that one token: we look for the token \"0\". We traverse the tokens:\n\n            token = the string representation of `res1`\n            We set a counter to 0, then for each token (only one) we increment the counter to 1 and then check if the token is \"0\". If it is, we break.\n\n          Then output the counter (which is 1).\n\n        But note: the second program breaks as soon as it finds a \"0\", and the counter is the number of tokens processed until the break. So if the token is \"0\", we break and output 1. If not, we finish the loop and output 1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          long res1 = ...; // computed from the first program\n          // Then we want to simulate the second program on the token array: [s] where s = string of res1.\n\n          int count = 0;\n          // We have one token: s.\n          count++;\n          if (strcmp(s, \"0\") == 0) {\n              // break immediately -> so we break after the first token.\n          }\n\n          Then output count (which is 1).\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to do anything with the string: we know there is one token and we always output 1.\n\n        So we can skip the string conversion and the tokenization.\n\n        Therefore, the program is:\n\n          Read n.\n          Read n integers and compute the array `cnt` and then `res` as in the first program? But we don't need `res` for the output (we output 1) but we do need to read the integers to avoid leaving them in the buffer? And to be faithful to the first program's behavior? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is: output 1. But the first program might have a different behavior if we don't compute the same `res`? The first program doesn't output anything until the end. But the chain's output is 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can avoid the computation? \n\n        But note: the first program might have arithmetic that causes a crash? For example, if `n` is negative? But the first program: `n` is read by `scan.nextInt()`. The for loop runs for `i in [0, n-1]` only if `n` is nonnegative? If `n` is negative, the loop doesn't run. In C, if we read a negative `n`, then the for loop condition `i < n` fails immediately. So the same.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the first program in Java uses an array of size 21. We don't need to create that array? Because we don't use the counts for anything. But we do need to read the integers? Yes.\n\n        Therefore, we can do without the array.\n\n        So the minimal C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int n;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  int x;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n              }\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". What if the first program does something that affects the environment? It doesn't.\n\n        But what if the first program has an integer overflow? The first program uses `long` for `res` and `cnt`. In C, we don't care because we are not computing `res`.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, let me test with the example: \n          Input: \"3 10 -10 0\"\n\n          The first program in Java would read n=3, then numbers 10, -10, 0.\n\n          Our C program: reads 3, then reads 10, -10, 0, then outputs 1.\n\n          The chain: the first program outputs 1, then the second program outputs 1.\n\n          So our C program outputs 1.\n\n        Therefore, we are reproducing the same behavior.\n\n        But what if the first program outputs a very large number? Our C program does not compute it, but we are not required to output it. We are only required to output the final result of the chain, which is 1.\n\n        Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n        However, to be completely faithful to the computation (if the problem requires that the first program's computation is done, even though the result is not used for the final output), we can compute the first program's result and then ignore it. But that would be inefficient and unnecessary.\n\n        The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The observable behavior is the output of the entire chain, which is 1, and the consumption of the input.\n\n        Therefore, the above program is acceptable.\n\n        But note: what if the first program doesn't read all the input? For example, if `n` is 3, but there are only 2 integers? Then the first program would crash. Our program would also crash? \n\n        In C, if we try to read an integer and there isn't one, then `scanf` returns EOF. We should check.\n\n        The first program in Java uses `scan.nextInt()` which would throw an exception if there are not enough integers. Our C program should mimic that? \n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically\". If the first program crashes, then the entire chain crashes. Our program should crash too.\n\n        How to crash? We can check the return value of `scanf`.\n\n        Let me adjust:\n\n          if (scanf(\"%d\", &n) != 1) {\n              // something went wrong -> we can return 1? but the Java program would throw an exception.\n              // Since the problem does not specify error handling, we assume valid input.\n          }\n\n        But the problem says the programs are meant to be executed in sequence. We assume valid input.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume that the input is as expected.\n\n        So the final program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int n;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  int x;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n              }\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n        But wait: the second program in the chain (atcoder_ABC170_A) originally reads from `stdin` the same `stdin` that the first program wrote to? Actually, in a chain of programs, the first program writes to stdout, and then the second program reads from stdout of the first via a pipe? \n\n        However, in our combined C program, we are not writing the intermediate result to stdout. We are directly passing the value in memory? But the problem says: without I/O in the middle.\n\n        Therefore, we skip the intermediate I/O.\n\n        And we have determined that the second program's output is always 1.\n\n        So we output 1.\n\n        Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We are doing the first program's input reading and the second program's output writing. We skip the computation of the first program's result because it is not needed for the final output (which is always 1).\n\n        We are reading the same input as the first program and then outputting 1.\n\n        This matches the chain.\n\n        Let me write the program accordingly.\n\n        However, what if the first program outputs a number with a space? For example, if we change the first program to output \"1 2\" instead of \"1\", then the second program would see two tokens and output 2? But the first program does not output a space. It outputs one integer by `System.out.println(res);` -> which is a single token.\n\n        Therefore, the second program always sees one token.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Final C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int n;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n              int x;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n              }\n              printf(\"1\\n\");\n              return 0;\n          }"
