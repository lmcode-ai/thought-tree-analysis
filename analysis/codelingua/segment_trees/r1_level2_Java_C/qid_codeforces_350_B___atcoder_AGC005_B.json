So the output chain is the entire chain in reverse order (from the last node to the start) and each number is printed with its digits reversed? Actually, no: each number is printed as the reversed digits of the original index. However, the original index is an integer. The program does not use the reversed-digit integer for the next step, it uses the original index.

When we reverse, the first character of the reversed buffer becomes '5', then '6', then space, etc. And we want to output: \"56 34 12 \" -> which has a trailing space?",

Then for i from 1 to n: \n                if a[i]==1, then it starts a chain and marks the nodes it visits. And then for the next i, if a node is already marked, it skips. This is correct. But note: the condition in the while loop: \n            while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] ! = 1)\n\n        We break if st[x] is true, so we don't visit a node twice. So our C code for part1 is as above. However, note: the condition `x != 0` is important: if b[i] is 0, then we break immediately. Also, if a[x]==1, then we break? But the first program does: \n            a[x] ! = 1 -> so if a[x]==1, we break. Why? because if a[x]==1, then that node is a start of its own chain? but we are already in a chain? Actually, the first program does not start a chain from x if a[x]==1? but it will be processed in a later iteration? and we mark the nodes, so we avoid processing it twice. So our condition: \n            while (x != 0 && ! st[x] && num[x] == 1 && a[x] ! = 1) But note: the first program breaks if any of these conditions fail, and then it marks only the nodes that are visited in the chain.

And if x is not 0, then it must be in [1, n] by the input. We'll assume that. Let me test with a small example. However, note: the second part might have issues with reversing integers: For example, node=100: reverse_integer(100) returns 1? But the first program: \n            It would convert 100 to string: \"100\", then reverse to \"001\", then the second program reads that as 1. So our reverse_integer function returns 1 for 100. This is correct. Also, node=10: returns 1? But 10 reversed is \"01\" -> which is 1. This matches. We are ready.

Then in the cleanup: \n            leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) - 1 = ind. So our C code: leftl[ind] = ind, is correct. However, the Java code: \n        leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1; In the cleanup, index is still -1? So we are good. But note: in the second part, we do:\n\n        // For the leftl: \n        top = -1;\n        index = N-1;\n        while (index >=0) {\n            while (top ! = -1 && arr[stack[top]] > arr[index]) {\n                int ind = stack[top--];\n                leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n            }\n            stack[++top] = index--;\n        }\n        while (top != -1) {\n            int ind = stack[top--];\n            leftl[ind] = ind;   // because at this point, index is -1? \n        } But note: the variable `index` in the cleanup is the value after the loop? which is -1. So it's correct. We'll write the code accordingly. Let me run a small example for the second part to be sure. Example: [2, 1, 3] (N=3)\n\n        We want to compute: \n            for 2: \n                left: [2] -> leftl[0] = 0 (only itself) -> actually, the number of consecutive to the left including itself that are >=2: only itself -> so the count of consecutive to the left that are >=2 until a smaller is found? The algorithm for leftl: \n                    We are computing the number of elements to the left of i that are >= a[i] until we hit a smaller one? Actually, the algorithm: \n                        leftl[i] = the number of elements strictly between the first element to the left that is smaller and the current element?",

(because we set: in cleanup: leftl[1]=1? because we do: leftl[1]=1 (the index) -> but that is 1, which is the count of elements to the left? But the expected for leftl[1] is 1? and we got 1.\n\n                        leftl[0]=0 -> correct? leftl[2]=0 -> correct. So the counts: \n                            i0: (0+1)*(0+1)=1\n                            i1: (1+1)*(1+1)=4\n                            i2: (0+1)*(0+1)=1\n\n                        Then total=2*1 + 1*4 + 3*1 = 2+4+3=9. So the algorithm is correct. Therefore, we write the code as described.",

Steps for part1 (without string building):\n\n            We'll keep:\n\n                int best_chain_length = 0;\n                int *best_chain_nodes = NULL;   // will store the chain in the order of traversal (start to end) for the best chain.

Then run part2 on: N = best_chain_length, array = arr. Then free arr. We write a helper function for reversing an integer:\n\n            int reverse_integer(int n) {\n                if (n == 0) return 0;\n                int rev = 0;\n                while (n != 0) {\n                    rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10);\n                    n /= 10;\n                }\n                return rev;\n            }\n\n        But note: negative numbers?

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one C program.\n The first program (codeforces_350_B) does:\n   - Reads n, then two arrays a and b of size n+1 (indexed from 1 to n).\n   - It then builds an array `num` counting the frequency of each value in b (for indices 1..n).\n   - Then it traverses for each index i from 1 to n where a[i] is 1, and follows a chain defined by b: starting at i, then to b[i], then to b[b[i]], etc. until breaking conditions (already visited, or num[x]!=1, or x==0, or a[x]==1).\n   - It builds a string representing the chain in reverse order? Actually, note that they use StringBuilder and then reverse the entire string at the end.\n\n However, note: the second program (atcoder_AGC005_B) is a completely different program that reads an array and computes the sum of min values over all subarrays in an efficient way.\n\n Since the problem says that the output of the first program is used as input to the next, we must note:\n\n The first program outputs:\n   - First line: an integer `ans` (the maximum chain length)\n   - Second line: a string `ss` which is a space separated list of the chain (in the order from the start to the end? But note the reversing)\n\n But the second program expects:\n   - First integer N, then an array of N integers.\n\n How do we connect?\n   - The first program's output is two lines: the first line is one integer (ans) and the second line is a string of space separated integers (ss).\n\n However, the second program does not use the output of the first program? Actually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But looking at the two programs, they are independent? The first program reads two arrays of n integers, and the second program reads an array of N integers.\n\n This seems to be a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps we are missing context.\n\n Let me re-read: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n But the two programs have different inputs and outputs.\n\n However, note: the first program outputs two lines: the first is an integer (the length) and the second is a space separated list of integers (the chain). The second program expects an integer N and then N integers.\n\n The chain from the first program (the second line) is a list of integers. The number of integers is `ans`. So we can use that as the array for the second program? But note the second program expects the first integer to be the size, then the array.\n\n So the input to the second program would be:\n   ans\n   <the chain as space separated integers>\n\n But the second program reads:\n   int N = scan.nextInt();\n   then an array of N integers.\n\n So the output of the first program is exactly the input format for the second program? Because the first line is the integer N (which is `ans`), and the second line has `ans` numbers.\n\n Therefore, we can chain them.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Run the first program: it reads n and two arrays a and b (each of n integers, but note the first program indexes from 1 to n, so we read n and then two arrays of n integers each).\n  2. The first program outputs two lines: the first is the integer `ans` (the maximum chain length) and the second is a string of `ans` space separated integers (the chain).\n  3. The second program then reads the first integer as N (which is `ans`), and then reads the next `ans` integers from the second line.\n\n But note: the second program expects the array to be on the same line? Actually, the second program reads:\n      N = scan.nextInt()\n      then for i in 0..N-1: a[i] = scan.nextInt()\n\n And the first program outputs:\n      System.out.println(ans);   -> one integer on a line\n      System.out.println(ss);     -> a string (which is the space separated integers) on the next line.\n\n Since the second program uses `nextInt` for the entire array, and the array is provided on the next line, that is acceptable because `nextInt` skips any whitespace (including newlines).\n\n Therefore, the entire process is:\n\n   Input to the first program:\n        n\n        a[1] a[2] ... a[n]   (n integers)\n        b[1] b[2] ... b[n]   (n integers)\n\n   Output of the first program (which becomes input to the second):\n        ans\n        i1 i2 ... i_ans\n\n   Then the second program reads:\n        N = ans\n        then the array [i1, i2, ..., i_ans] of length ans.\n\n   And then the second program computes the sum as described and outputs one long integer.\n\n However, note: the first program uses 1-indexing for arrays a and b, and the second program uses 0-indexing.\n\n But the chain produced by the first program is a list of indices (from the original array). The second program uses these indices as the array values? Actually, no: the second program uses the values as the array `a` for its computation.\n\n But the chain produced by the first program is the sequence of indices (or values?).\n\n Let me look at the first program:\n\n   They start at index i (if a[i]==1). Then they append the index i (as a string, but note they reverse each number? Actually, they do:\n\n        sss.append(i);   // appends the integer i as a string? Actually, no: they are appending the integer, but then they reverse the string of that integer? That would reverse the digits.\n\n   Example: if i=12, then sss becomes \"12\", then reversed becomes \"21\". Then they do the same for the next index.\n\n   This is likely a bug? Or maybe the problem requires the digits to be reversed? But then the second program would read the reversed digits as numbers.\n\n   This seems very odd. Alternatively, perhaps the reversing is a mistake? Actually, the program does:\n\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        ... then for each step:\n            sss = new StringBuilder();\n            sss.append(x);   // so sss is the string of x\n            sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());   // here, sss.reverse() reverses the string of x.\n\n        Then at the end: ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n\n   So they are reversing each number and then the entire string? \n\n   Example: chain: 1 -> 2 -> 3\n        Step 1: i=1: \n            sss = \"1\", reverse -> \"1\", then sb becomes \" 1\"\n        Step 2: x=2: \n            sss = \"2\", reverse -> \"2\", then sb becomes \" 1 2\" -> actually: \" 1\" + \" \" + \"2\" -> \" 1 2\"\n        Then at the end: reverse the entire string: \"2 1 \" -> but note the leading space.\n\n   Then they print: \n        System.out.println(ans);\n        System.out.println(ss);\n\n   So for the chain [1,2,3] (with three nodes) the output would be:\n        ans = 3\n        and the string would be: \n            Initially: sb = \" 1 2 3\" (if we did three steps) -> then reversed: \"3 2 1 \"\n\n   But note: they break when they hit a condition. And they only do the chain for consecutive nodes until the break condition.\n\n   Actually, the intended chain is to be printed from the start to the end? But the reversing makes it from the end to the start? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the order, but note: the second program will read the integers in the order they are printed on the second line.\n\n   So if the chain is printed as \"3 2 1\", then the second program will read the array as [3,2,1] (if there are three numbers).\n\n   This might be acceptable? But note: the first program's output is defined as the chain in reverse order? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must replicate the reversing of each number and the entire string? \n\n   But wait: the reversing of each number is done and then the entire string is reversed. This is equivalent to:\n\n        Instead of having the chain: i0, i1, i2, ... , i_{k-1}\n        They form a string: \" i0_reversed i1_reversed ... i_{k-1}_reversed\"\n        Then reverse the entire string: becomes \"i_{k-1}_reversed ... i0_reversed\" but without the spaces? Actually, the spaces are also reversed.\n\n   Example: \n        Step: i0=12, i1=34, i2=56\n        After step 0: \" 21\"\n        After step 1: \" 21 43\"\n        After step 2: \" 21 43 65\"\n        Then reverse the entire string: \"56 34 12\" becomes \"56 34 12\" -> wait, no: \n          The string is \" 21 43 65\" -> reversing: \"56 34 12 \"? Actually:\n\n          Original string: \" 21 43 65\"\n          Reversed: \n            character by character: \n                '5','6',' ','3','4',' ','1','2',' ' -> becomes \"56 34 12 \"? But note the leading space: the entire string has a leading space and then each number is separated by a space.\n\n        Actually, the first step appends: \" \" + sss.reverse() -> so the first append is \" 1\" (if i=1) and then next is \" 2\", so the string becomes \" 1 2\".\n\n        Then reversing: \"2 1 \" -> but note the last space? Actually, the entire string has a trailing space? No, because the last append is \" \" + the reversed string of the last number.\n\n        Then when reversed, we get: the last number's reversed string (without space) becomes the first token? Then the space becomes the separator.\n\n        Example: \n            Step 1: i=1 -> \" 1\" -> then the entire string is \" 1\"\n            Reverse: becomes \"1 \" -> which is \"1\" and then a space? But when printed, it would be \"1 \".\n\n        Then the second program reading the second line: \n            It will read the first integer from \"1 \" -> that would be 1, and then it would try to read the next integer and fail? Or the space is skipped? \n\n        Actually, the second program uses `nextInt` which skips any whitespace. So it would read the 1 and then try to read the next integer and hit the end? \n\n        But the chain length is 1, so the second program reads N=1 and then one integer -> so it reads the 1 and then stops? \n\n        However, the trailing space might cause an issue? But `nextInt` doesn't care.\n\n   But note: the first program's output for the chain string has a trailing space? Actually, the example above: \n        For chain length 1: the string is \"1 \"? \n\n        How do they build the string?\n            Initially: for i (the first node): \n                sss = new StringBuilder(); \n                sss.append(i); -> then reverse -> so if i=1, then \"1\" becomes \"1\"\n                Then: sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()) -> becomes \" 1\"\n            Then they reverse the entire sb: \n                sb = \" 1\" -> reversed becomes \"1 \".\n\n        So yes, the output for the chain is a string that starts with a digit and then a space at the end? \n\n        But the chain of length 1: the output is \"1 \" (with a trailing space). \n\n        Then the second program reads: \n            First integer: 1 (from the first line)\n            Then the second line: it tries to read one integer: it reads 1 (from the string \"1 \") and then the next token? There is no next token? So it would work.\n\n        However, if the chain has more than one, then the string is: \n            For two nodes: \n                Step0: \" 1\"\n                Step1: \" 1 2\" -> then reversed: \"2 1 \" -> so the string is \"2 1 \" (with a trailing space).\n\n        The second program will read two integers: 2 and 1.\n\n   So the reversing of the entire string and the reversing of each number? \n\n   But note: the reversing of each number is done on the string representation. This is not the same as the original index. \n\n   Example: if the index is 12, then the reversed string is \"21\", which is 21 as an integer. \n\n   This is a transformation of the index. So the second program does not receive the original indices, but the reversed-digit version.\n\n   This is part of the first program's specification.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must do the same.\n\n   Steps for the first part:\n\n        Read n, then two arrays a[1..n] and b[1..n].\n\n        Build an array `num` for frequencies of b[i] for i in 1..n.\n\n        Then traverse i from 1 to n:\n            if a[i]==1, then we start a chain: \n                We mark st[i]=true.\n                We start building a string for the chain, but we will store the chain nodes in reverse digit form? and then reverse the entire string.\n\n        How to simulate the chain building:\n\n            We have a current node = i.\n            We create a temporary list (or stack) to record the chain of numbers (in the order of traversal) but each number is stored as the reversed-digit string.\n\n            We start by pushing the reversed-digit string of i.\n\n            Then we set x = b[i] and then while (x is not marked, and num[x]==1 and x!=0 and a[x]!=1) then we push the reversed-digit string of x, mark x, and set x = b[x].\n\n            Then we form a string by concatenating these reversed-digit strings in the order of the chain? But note: they build the string in the forward order (from i to the end) and then reverse the entire string.\n\n            However, when we reverse the entire string, the last node becomes the first.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build the chain in reverse order? \n\n        Actually, the first program does:\n\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            ... then for each node (starting at i) we do:\n                sss = new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(x)); \n                sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse().toString());\n\n            Then at the end, we do: \n                ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n\n        How to interpret? \n\n            Example: chain: i, then x1, then x2.\n\n            The string in sb becomes: \" <reversed_i> <reversed_x1> <reversed_x2>\"\n\n            Then we reverse the entire sb: so the entire string is reversed: the last character of the reversed_x2 becomes the first, then the space, then the rest.\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            We want to output the chain in the order: x2, x1, i? But the digits of each number are also reversed.\n\n        Actually, no: because reversing the entire string including the spaces and the digits.\n\n        Example: chain: i=12, x1=34, x2=56.\n\n            Step for i=12: \n                reversed_i = \"21\" -> append \" 21\" -> so sb = \" 21\"\n            Step for x1=34:\n                reversed_x1 = \"43\" -> append \" 43\" -> sb = \" 21 43\"\n            Step for x2=56:\n                reversed_x2 = \"65\" -> append \" 65\" -> sb = \" 21 43 65\"\n\n            Then reverse the entire sb: \n                Original: \" 21 43 65\" -> reversed: \"56 34 12 \"? \n                Actually: \n                    Original: [' ', '2','1',' ','4','3',' ','6','5']\n                    Reversed: ['5','6',' ','3','4',' ','1','2',' ']\n\n            So the string becomes: \"56 34 12 \".\n\n        Therefore, the chain is printed from the last node to the first node, and each node is printed with its digits reversed.\n\n        But note: the last node in the chain (the one we break at) is the one that we did not break in the middle? So the chain is from the start (i) to the last node (the one that breaks the condition) and then we reverse the entire chain.\n\n        So the output chain is the entire chain in reverse order (from the last node to the start) and each number is printed with its digits reversed? Actually, no: each number is printed as the reversed digits of the original index.\n\n        However, the original index is an integer. The program does not use the reversed-digit integer for the next step, it uses the original index.\n\n        So the chain of indices is: i0, i1, i2, ... , i_{k-1} (with i0 = i, i1 = b[i0], etc.)\n\n        The output chain string is: \n            reversed_digits(i_{k-1]) + \" \" + ... + \" \" + reversed_digits(i0) and then a trailing space.\n\n        But note: the entire string is built by appending a space and then the reversed string of the current node. Then the entire string is reversed. This results in the reversed string of the last node being the first token, then the reversed string of the previous node, etc.\n\n        And each token is the reversed digits of the node index.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will read the chain as an array of integers, where each integer is the reversed digits of the original index.\n\n        Example: if the chain was [12, 34, 56] (so we start at 12, then go to 34, then to 56) then the output chain string is \"65 43 21 \".\n\n        Then the second program will read:\n            N = 3\n            Then the array: [65, 43, 21]\n\n        Then the second program will compute the sum over all contiguous subarrays of the minimum value? But note: the second program is the atcoder one: it computes the sum of min over all contiguous subarrays by an efficient method.\n\n   So we must code two parts in C:\n\n        Part1: \n            Read n, then two arrays a and b of n integers (index 1 to n, but in C we use 0-indexing? we'll adjust).\n\n        However, note: the first program uses 1-indexing: the arrays a and b are indexed from 1 to n, and the b array values are in the range [0, n]? (since num[b[i]]++ and b[i] can be 0? because the condition x!=0).\n\n        We'll create arrays a[1..n] and b[1..n] in C. We can use arrays of size n+1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int *a = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n            int *b = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n\n            Then build an array `num` of frequencies: \n                int *num = (int*)calloc(n+1, sizeof(int)); // index 0 to n\n                for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (b[i] >=0 && b[i]<=n) \n                        num[b[i]]++;\n                    // if b[i] is outside, then we skip? but note: the first program does not check bounds for num, so we assume b[i] in [0, n]?\n                }\n\n            Then we need an array `st` (visited) for indices 1..n, initially false.\n\n            Then we traverse i from 1 to n:\n                if (a[i] == 1) {\n                    // start chain at i\n                    // We'll simulate the chain and build a string for this chain.\n\n                    We need to record the chain in a temporary array (as we go) but we also need to mark visited nodes.\n\n                    We'll create a dynamic string (or we can use a stack) for the current chain.\n\n                    Steps for this chain:\n                        current = i\n                        We mark st[i] = true.\n                        We push the reversed-digit string of i? But we don't want to build the entire string until we break? because we need to know the length to compare.\n\n                    Actually, the first program builds the string in a StringBuilder as they traverse. Then at the end, they reverse the entire string.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        char *chain_string = NULL; // we'll build the string for this chain in reverse order? but note: we are going to reverse the entire string at the end.\n\n                        Actually, we can build the chain in a linked list of tokens? But easier: we can store the tokens (the reversed-digit strings) in an array and then combine them in reverse order? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n                        We create a temporary buffer for the entire chain string for this chain? But we don't know the length.\n\n                    We note: we are going to compare the chain length (s) and then if it's the longest, we store the entire chain string.\n\n                    Steps:\n\n                        int s = 0;\n                        // We are going to traverse the chain and record the nodes in the chain (in the order of traversal) but we will convert each node to a reversed-digit string and then we will build the string in the forward order (with spaces) and then reverse the entire string at the end.\n\n                        But note: the first program does:\n\n                            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                            // for the first node: \n                            sss = new StringBuilder().append(i).reverse();\n                            sb.append(\" \" + sss);   // which is \" \" + reversed_i\n\n                        Then for the next node x:\n                            sss = new StringBuilder().append(x).reverse();\n                            sb.append(\" \" + sss);   // so we add \" \" + reversed_x\n\n                        Then at the end: \n                            ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n\n                        This is equivalent to:\n\n                            We have a string: \" reversed_i reversed_x ... \" (with a space before each token) -> then reversed.\n\n                        We can instead build the entire chain in reverse order: \n\n                            We traverse the chain from the start to the end, and for each node we output the reversed-digit string and then a space, but then we reverse the entire string.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can traverse the chain and store the nodes in a stack (so the last node is on top). Then we pop and output in reverse order? But note: the entire string is reversed, including the digits.\n\n                        Actually, we can avoid building the entire string until we break? \n\n                    We decide:\n\n                        We will traverse the chain and store the nodes in an array (or stack) in the order of traversal.\n\n                        Then we can form the string by:\n\n                            total_string = \"\"\n                            for each node in the chain (from the first to the last):\n                                token = reverse_digits(node)\n                                total_string = \" \" + token + total_string   (but then we don't need to reverse the entire string at the end)\n\n                        But note: the first program reverses the entire string at the end. So if we build the string from the last node to the first (with the tokens in their original digit order) and then we put a space and the token at the beginning, we get:\n\n                            chain: [i0, i1, i2] \n                            We want: \n                                token0 = reverse_digits(i0) -> \"A\"\n                                token1 = reverse_digits(i1) -> \"B\"\n                                token2 = reverse_digits(i2) -> \"C\"\n\n                            Then we build: \n                                s = \" \" + \"A\" -> then \" \" + \"B\" + s -> then \" \" + \"C\" + s -> then reverse the entire s: \n                                    s becomes \" A B C\" -> then reversed: \"C B A \"\n\n                        Alternatively, if we build the string from the last node to the first, and for each node we put the token (without reversing the entire string) and then a space, and then the next token? \n\n                        Actually, we can build:\n\n                            s = \"\"\n                            for j = last node down to first node:\n                                s = s + reverse_digits(j) + \" \"\n\n                            Then we have: s = \"C B A \" -> which is the same as above.\n\n                        So we can avoid the entire string reversal by traversing the chain in reverse order? But the chain is built in forward order.\n\n                        How to get the chain in reverse order? We can store the chain in an array as we traverse, then output from the last element to the first.\n\n                    Therefore, we do:\n\n                        We'll create an array `chain` to store the nodes in the order of traversal (from start to end).\n\n                        Then we form the string for this chain by:\n\n                            temp_string = (char*)malloc( enough memory );\n                            temp_string[0] = '\\0';\n                            for (int j = chain_length-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                                char token[20]; // enough for an integer\n                                sprintf(token, \"%d\", chain[j]); \n                                reverse_string(token); // reverse the string of token\n                                strcat(temp_string, token);\n                                strcat(temp_string, \" \");\n                            }\n\n                        Then this temp_string is the chain string for this chain? \n\n                        But note: the first program does not reverse the entire string? It reverses each token and then the entire string? \n\n                        Actually, the first program reverses each token and then appends a space and the token to the string, and then reverses the entire string. \n\n                        We just built the string by reversing the order of the tokens and also each token is reversed? \n\n                        Example: \n                            chain: [12,34,56] (in the order of traversal: 12 then 34 then 56)\n                            We store in the array: chain[0]=12, chain[1]=34, chain[2]=56.\n\n                            Then we traverse j from 2 to 0:\n                                j=2: token = 56 -> reverse to \"65\", then temp_string = \"65 \"\n                                j=1: token=34 -> reverse to \"43\", then temp_string = \"65 43 \"\n                                j=0: token=12 -> reverse to \"21\", then temp_string = \"65 43 21 \"\n\n                        Then the first program would have built: \n                            Initially: \" 21\"\n                            Then: \" 21 43\"\n                            Then: \" 21 43 65\"\n                            Then reverse: becomes \"56 34 12 \"? -> no, we have to reverse the entire string: \n\n                                Original: \" 21 43 65\" -> reversed: \n                                    We have: [' ','2','1',' ','4','3',' ','6','5'] -> reversed: \n                                    ['5','6',' ','3','4',' ','1','2',' '] -> which is \"56 34 12 \".\n\n                        But our method produced: \"65 43 21 \".\n\n                        They are different.\n\n                    How to fix?\n\n                        The first program does:\n\n                            For the first node: \n                                token = reverse_digits(i) -> for 12: \"21\"\n                                then they append: \" \" + token -> so the string becomes \" 21\"\n\n                            Then for the next node (34): \n                                token = reverse_digits(34) -> \"43\"\n                                then append: \" \" + token -> so the string becomes \" 21 43\"\n\n                            Then for the next node (56): \n                                token = reverse_digits(56) -> \"65\"\n                                then append: \" \" + token -> so the string becomes \" 21 43 65\"\n\n                            Then reverse the entire string: \n                                becomes: \"56 34 12 \"\n\n                        We want to produce \"56 34 12 \".\n\n                        How to build without storing the entire chain? \n\n                        We can build the string in the forward order (with the tokens in the order of traversal, each token reversed) and then reverse the entire string at the end.\n\n                    We'll do:\n\n                        We traverse the chain and for each node, we convert the node to a string, reverse that string, and then append that token to a buffer (with a space in front).\n\n                        Then we reverse the entire buffer.\n\n                    But note: the buffer is built with a leading space? \n\n                        For the first node: we do: \n                            buffer = (char*)malloc(...);\n                            sprintf(buffer, \" %s\", reversed_token0);\n\n                        Then for the next: \n                            sprintf(buffer + strlen(buffer), \" %s\", reversed_token1);\n\n                        Then at the end, we reverse the entire buffer.\n\n                    Example: \n                        node0=12 -> token0 = \"21\" -> buffer = \" 21\"\n                        node1=34 -> token1 = \"43\" -> buffer = \" 21 43\"\n                        node2=56 -> token2 = \"65\" -> buffer = \" 21 43 65\"\n\n                        Then reverse: \n                            We reverse the entire buffer: \n                                We reverse each character: \n                                    Original: [' ','2','1',' ','4','3',' ','6','5','\\0'] -> we must reverse without the null?\n                                Actually, we reverse the string: \n                                    We swap from 0 to len-1: \n                                        becomes: \"56 34 12 \" -> but note: the last character is '\\0', so we don't swap that.\n\n                        How to reverse a string in C: we can do:\n\n                            int len = strlen(buffer);\n                            for (int i=0; i<len/2; i++) {\n                                char t = buffer[i];\n                                buffer[i] = buffer[len-1-i];\n                                buffer[len-1-i] = t;\n                            }\n\n                        Then buffer becomes: \n                            Original: \" 21 43 65\" -> reversed: \"56 34 12 \"\n\n                    However, note the trailing space: the last character of the original buffer is '5' (for the example) and then the null terminator. When we reverse, the first character of the reversed buffer becomes '5', then '6', then space, etc.\n\n                    And we want to output: \"56 34 12 \" -> which has a trailing space? Actually, the first program outputs a trailing space.\n\n                    But the second program uses `scanf` which skips whitespace, so it's okay.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll create a global buffer for the current chain? But we only need the best chain.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                int best_chain_length = 0;\n                char *best_chain_string = NULL;\n\n                for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 1) {\n                        // We'll create a temporary buffer for the chain string for this chain.\n                        // We'll use a linked list of tokens? or we can compute the required length.\n\n                        // First, traverse the chain to know the nodes and the length.\n                        int current = i;\n                        int count = 0;\n                        int *nodes = (int*)malloc( (n+1) * sizeof(int) ); // at most n nodes.\n\n                        nodes[count++] = i;\n                        st[i] = 1;   // mark visited.\n\n                        int x = b[i];\n                        while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x] == 1 && a[x] != 1) {\n                            st[x] = 1;\n                            nodes[count++] = x;\n                            x = b[x];\n                        }\n\n                        // Now we have the chain of `count` nodes: from i to the last node.\n\n                        // Build the string for this chain in the forward order (each node converted to reversed-digit string, and then we will reverse the entire string at the end).\n                        // First, compute the total length needed.\n\n                        int total_length = 0;\n                        for (int j=0; j<count; j++) {\n                            // convert nodes[j] to string, then reverse -> the length is the number of digits plus one for the space (but note: we add a space for each token, including the first? the first program adds a space for the first token: \" %s\")\n                            // Actually, the first program: for the first token: \" \" + token, then for each next: \" \" + token.\n                            // So each token is preceded by a space.\n\n                            char temp[20];\n                            sprintf(temp, \"%d\", nodes[j]);\n                            // the number of digits in the token is strlen(temp), but then we reverse and the length remains the same.\n                            total_length += strlen(temp) + 1; // one for the space\n                        }\n                        // Then we allocate a buffer of size total_length+1 (for the null terminator).\n\n                        char *buf = (char*)malloc(total_length+1);\n                        buf[0] = '\\0';\n\n                        for (int j=0; j<count; j++) {\n                            char temp[20];\n                            sprintf(temp, \"%d\", nodes[j]);\n                            // reverse the string temp\n                            int len_temp = strlen(temp);\n                            for (int k=0; k<len_temp/2; k++) {\n                                char t = temp[k];\n                                temp[k] = temp[len_temp-1-k];\n                                temp[len_temp-1-k] = t;\n                            }\n                            // append a space and then the reversed string\n                            strcat(buf, \" \");\n                            strcat(buf, temp);\n                        }\n\n                        // Now, reverse the entire buf (excluding the null terminator) to get the final chain string.\n                        int len_buf = strlen(buf);\n                        for (int k=0; k<len_buf/2; k++) {\n                            char t = buf[k];\n                            buf[k] = buf[len_buf-1-k];\n                            buf[len_buf-1-k] = t;\n                        }\n\n                        // Now, we have the string in buf.

But we are going to run the second part, so we might want to free at the very end.\n\n        However, the above simulation marks nodes as visited during the chain. But note: the first program marks nodes as visited only for the current chain? and then moves to the next i? \n\n        But the first program: \n            It initializes st[] to false.\n            Then for i from 1 to n: \n                if a[i]==1, then it starts a chain and marks the nodes it visits.\n\n            And then for the next i, if a node is already marked, it skips.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: \n            while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] != 1)\n\n        We break if st[x] is true, so we don't visit a node twice.\n\n        So our C code for part1 is as above.\n\n        However, note: the condition `x != 0` is important: if b[i] is 0, then we break immediately.\n\n        Also, if a[x]==1, then we break? But the first program does: \n            a[x] != 1 -> so if a[x]==1, we break.\n\n        Why? because if a[x]==1, then that node is a start of its own chain? but we are already in a chain? \n\n        Actually, the first program does not start a chain from x if a[x]==1? but it will be processed in a later iteration? and we mark the nodes, so we avoid processing it twice.\n\n        So our condition: \n            while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x] == 1 && a[x] != 1)\n\n        But note: the first program breaks if any of these conditions fail, and then it marks only the nodes that are visited in the chain.\n\n        Important: the condition `num[x] == 1` means that the value x appears only once in the b array? \n\n        Why is that condition there? It ensures that x is not used as a predecessor by multiple nodes? so we can form a unique chain.\n\n        So we must follow the same conditions.\n\n        Also, note: the first program does not mark the node that breaks the condition? \n\n            Example: \n                We start at i: mark i.\n                x = b[i]: then if the condition holds, we mark x and then set x = b[x].\n                Then when we break, the node that caused the break (say x) is not marked.\n\n            In our code above, we mark only the nodes that are added to the chain (which are the ones that passed the condition). The last node that broke the condition is not added and not marked.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Part2: \n        Then we run the second program: \n            Read N = best_chain_length (from the first part's output) and then an array of N integers: the integers from the chain string.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs the chain string as a string of integers (with spaces) and a newline.\n\n        Then we do the second program: \n\n            We read:\n                int N;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n                int *arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n                }\n\n            Then we compute:\n\n                We need to compute: \n                    ans = 0;\n                    for each i: \n                        we want to know: \n                            leftl[i]: the number of consecutive elements to the left that are >= arr[i] (until a smaller one is found) \n                            rightl[i]: the number of consecutive elements to the right that are >= arr[i] (until a smaller one is found)\n\n                    Then ans += (long)arr[i] * (leftl[i]+1) * (rightl[i]+1);\n\n            We can do with a stack.\n\n            Steps for the second part (as in the Java code):\n\n                int leftl[N], rightl[N];\n                // For the left: \n                Deque (stack) for indices.\n\n                But in C, we use an array as stack.\n\n                int stack[N]; \n                int top = -1;\n                int index = 0;\n                while (index < N) {\n                    while (top!=-1 && arr[stack[top]] > arr[index]) {\n                        int ind = stack[top--];\n                        rightl[ind] = index - ind - 1;\n                    }\n                    stack[++top] = index++;\n                }\n                while (top != -1) {\n                    int ind = stack[top--];\n                    rightl[ind] = N - ind - 1;\n                }\n\n                // For the right: \n                top = -1;\n                index = N-1;\n                while (index >=0) {\n                    while (top!=-1 && arr[stack[top]] > arr[index]) {\n                        int ind = stack[top--];\n                        leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n                    }\n                    stack[++top] = index--;\n                }\n                while (top != -1) {\n                    int ind = stack[top--];\n                    leftl[ind] = ind; // wait, the Java code: leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1; but index is -1? \n                    // Actually, in the Java code: \n                    //   while (index >=0) ... and then at the end: \n                    //   while (!que.isEmpty()) { \n                    //        int ind = que.poll();\n                    //        leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1; \n                    //   }\n                    // But at the end of the while (index>=0) loop, index becomes -1? \n                    // Then for each remaining element: leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) - 1 = ind.\n                    // So in C: \n                    leftl[ind] = ind; // because index is -1 at this point? \n                    // But note: the Java code uses `index` which is the last value after the while loop? \n                    // Actually, the Java code: \n                    //   index = N-1;\n                    //   while (index >=0) { ... index--; }\n                    //   Then at the end, index becomes -1? \n                    //   Then in the cleanup: \n                    //        while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n                    //            int ind = que.poll();\n                    //            leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) - 1 = ind;\n                    //        }\n                }\n\n                Then:\n                    long long ans = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                        ans += (long long)arr[i] * (leftl[i]+1) * (rightl[i]+1);\n                    }\n                    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n   But note: the Java code for the second part uses 0-indexed arrays.\n\n   However, the first part produces the chain string as a string of integers? and then we read them into an array `arr` of size N.\n\n   Then we run the stack algorithm.\n\n   Important: the second part uses the array `a` (which we read from the chain) and we call it `arr` in C.\n\n   We must free all allocated memory.\n\n   But note: we are combining the two programs. The entire input to the first program is:\n\n        n\n        a[1..n] (n integers)\n        b[1..n] (n integers)\n\n   Then the first program outputs two lines: \n        best_chain_length\n        chain_string (with a trailing space and then a newline)\n\n   Then the second program uses that as input and outputs one integer (the sum).\n\n   So the overall program in C:\n\n        Step1: Read n, then the two arrays a and b (for the first part).\n        Step2: Run the first part (which computes the chain) and then we have the two outputs: \n                best_chain_length and the chain_string (which is a string of best_chain_length integers, separated by spaces and with a trailing space? and then a newline).\n\n        But we are not going to actually print and then read again? because we are combining.\n\n        Instead, we can:\n\n            We do not print the intermediate output. We simulate the input to the second program:\n\n                The second program's input is:\n                    first integer: best_chain_length\n                    then best_chain_length integers: which are the integers in the chain_string.\n\n            How to get these integers? \n\n                We built the chain_string as a string. Then we can parse that string? \n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid building the string for the chain and then parsing it? \n\n                We already have the array of integers that we would have printed? But note: the integers we printed are the reversed-digit versions of the nodes.\n\n                Example: \n                    In the first part, we stored the chain nodes in `nodes` (the original indices) and then we formed the chain_string by reversing the digits of each node and then reversing the entire string? but then we printed the chain_string.\n\n                Then the second program reads the integers from that string.\n\n            But we don't want to print and then re-read? we can pass the data in memory.\n\n            How? \n\n                We can store the integers that would be in the chain_string in an array: \n\n                    For the best_chain, we have an array `best_chain_nodes` of length `best_chain_length` (the original indices) and then we transformed each node by:\n\n                        reversed_digits = the integer formed by reversing the digits of the node.\n\n                    Then we can create an array `arr` of size best_chain_length, where:\n\n                         arr[i] = reversed_digit_integer of the node that was in the chain at position i? \n\n                    But note: the chain_string we built was: \n                         We had the chain in the array `nodes` (from start to end) and then we built the string by:\n\n                             for j=0 to count-1:\n                                 token = reversed_digit_string(nodes[j])\n                                 then we put that token in the buffer (with a space) and then reversed the entire buffer? \n\n                         Then the string becomes: the tokens in reverse order (last node first) and each token is the reversed digits? \n\n                         But then when we parse the string, we get the integers: the first token in the string is the reversed-digit integer of the last node, and so on.\n\n                    How is that stored in the array for the second program? \n\n                         The second program reads the first integer (the chain length) and then the integers in the order they appear in the string.\n\n                         So the array `arr` for the second program is:\n\n                             arr[0] = reversed_digit_integer( last node in the chain )\n                             arr[1] = reversed_digit_integer( second last node in the chain )\n                             ...\n\n                         But we want: \n                             We have the chain nodes: \n                                 node0, node1, ... , node_{k-1} (from start to end)\n\n                         Then the chain_string is: \n                             token_{k-1} token_{k-2} ... token_0   (each token is the reversed_digit_integer of the node)\n\n                         And the second program reads: \n                             arr[0] = token_{k-1}\n                             arr[1] = token_{k-2}\n                             ...\n\n                         So we can build the array `arr` for the second program as:\n\n                             for j=0; j<best_chain_length; j++) {\n                                 // we want the token for the node: nodes[ best_chain_length - 1 - j ]\n                                 // and that token is the reversed-digit integer of the node.\n\n                                 arr[j] = reverse_digits_integer( nodes[ best_chain_length-1-j ] );\n                             }\n\n            How to reverse the digits of an integer to form a new integer?\n\n                Example: 12 -> 21, 100 -> 1 (but note: the string reversal of \"100\" is \"001\", which is 1? but in the first part, we did string reversal and then converted to integer? so the second program reads 001 as 1.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    int reverse_digits(int n) {\n                        int rev = 0;\n                        while (n) {\n                            rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10);\n                            n /= 10;\n                        }\n                        return rev;\n                    }\n\n                But note: if n is 0, then we return 0.\n\n            However, the first part did:\n\n                    char temp[20];\n                    sprintf(temp, \"%d\", n);\n                    // reverse the string temp\n                    // then convert back to integer? not necessary, but we did not convert to integer in the first part, we built a string.\n\n                And then we built a string and then the second program read that string as an integer.\n\n                So the integer value of the string \"001\" is 1.\n\n                The function above for 100: \n                    n=100:\n                        rev=0\n                        rev = 0*10+0=0, n=10\n                        rev = 0*10+0=0, n=1\n                        rev = 0*10+1=1, n=0\n                    returns 1.\n\n                So it matches.\n\n            Therefore, we can avoid building the intermediate string and then parsing it? \n\n                We can compute the array for the second program directly from the best_chain_nodes.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                In the first part, when we find the best chain, we store:\n\n                    best_chain_nodes = the array of nodes (from start to end) of the best chain, length = best_chain_length.\n\n                Then we create an array for the second program:\n\n                    int *second_arr = (int*)malloc(best_chain_length * sizeof(int));\n                    for (int j=0; j<best_chain_length; j++) {\n                        // we want the j-th element in the second program's array to be the reversed-digit integer of the node: best_chain_nodes[ best_chain_length-1-j ]\n                        second_arr[j] = reverse_integer(best_chain_nodes[best_chain_length-1-j]);\n                    }\n\n            Then we run the second program on:\n\n                N = best_chain_length\n                arr = second_arr\n\n            And then compute the sum.\n\n        This avoids the string building and parsing.\n\n        But note: the first program's output is defined as the chain string. We are not printing it? \n\n        The problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" -> so the final output is the output of the second program.\n\n        And the first program's output is only used as input to the second, so we don't need to print it.\n\n        Therefore, we can do the entire chain in memory.\n\n        Revised plan for part1:\n\n            Instead of building a string for the best_chain, we store the best_chain_nodes (the array of nodes in the chain in the order of traversal) and the length.\n\n            Then after part1, we create the array for part2 by reversing the order of the chain and reversing the digits of each node (as integers).\n\n        Steps for part1 (without string building):\n\n            We'll keep:\n\n                int best_chain_length = 0;\n                int *best_chain_nodes = NULL;   // will store the chain in the order of traversal (start to end) for the best chain.\n\n            Then for each i from 1 to n:\n\n                if (a[i]==1) {\n                    // traverse the chain and record the nodes in an array `chain` (in the order of traversal) and count the length.\n\n                    int *chain = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n                    int count = 0;\n                    chain[count++] = i;\n                    st[i] = 1;\n                    int x = b[i];\n                    while (x!=0 && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1) {\n                        st[x] = 1;\n                        chain[count++] = x;\n                        x = b[x];\n                    }\n\n                    if (count > best_chain_length) {\n                        best_chain_length = count;\n                        free(best_chain_nodes);\n                        best_chain_nodes = chain;\n                    } else {\n                        free(chain);\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then, if best_chain_length==0, then the second program will read N=0 and then no integers? and output 0.\n\n            Otherwise, we build the array for the second program:\n\n                int *arr = (int*)malloc(best_chain_length * sizeof(int));\n                for (int j=0; j<best_chain_length; j++) {\n                    // the j-th element in the second program's array should be the reversed integer of the node: best_chain_nodes[best_chain_length-1-j]\n                    arr[j] = reverse_integer(best_chain_nodes[best_chain_length-1-j]);\n                }\n\n            Then free best_chain_nodes.\n\n        Then run part2 on: N = best_chain_length, array = arr.\n\n        Then free arr.\n\n        We write a helper function for reversing an integer:\n\n            int reverse_integer(int n) {\n                if (n == 0) return 0;\n                int rev = 0;\n                while (n != 0) {\n                    rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10);\n                    n /= 10;\n                }\n                return rev;\n            }\n\n        But note: negative numbers? The problem says the indices are positive? (from 1 to n) so no negative.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses x = b[i] and b[i] can be 0? so we have condition x!=0. And 0 is not positive? \n\n        In the chain, if we encounter 0, we break. So the chain does not include 0.\n\n        So the nodes in the chain are from 1 to n? positive.\n\n   Therefore, we can do.\n\n   Final structure:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int reverse_integer(int n) {\n            int rev = 0;\n            while (n) {\n                rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10);\n                n /= 10;\n            }\n            return rev;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Part1: read n and two arrays a and b (indexed from 1 to n)\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int *a = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n            int *b = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n\n            // Build frequency array for b: num[x] for x in [0, n] (we use 0-indexed of size n+1)\n            int *num = (int*)calloc(n+1, sizeof(int));\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (b[i] <= n && b[i]>=0) \n                    num[b[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            // visited array st, size n+1, initialized to 0.\n            int *st = (int*)calloc(n+1, sizeof(int));\n\n            int best_chain_length = 0;\n            int *best_chain_nodes = NULL;\n\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (a[i] == 1) {\n                    // Start chain from i.\n                    int *chain = (int*)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(int));\n                    int count = 0;\n                    chain[count++] = i;\n                    st[i] = 1;\n                    int x = b[i];\n                    while (x != 0 && x<=n && x>=1 && st[x]==0 && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1) {\n                        st[x] = 1;\n                        chain[count++] = x;\n                        x = b[x];\n                    }\n                    if (count > best_chain_length) {\n                        best_chain_length = count;\n                        free(best_chain_nodes);\n                        best_chain_nodes = chain;\n                    } else {\n                        free(chain);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now, if best_chain_length==0, then we create an empty array for the second part.\n            int N = best_chain_length;\n            int *arr = NULL;\n            if (N > 0) {\n                arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                for (int j=0; j<N; j++) {\n                    // j-th element in the second program's input array is the reversed integer of the node at position (N-1-j) in best_chain_nodes.\n                    arr[j] = reverse_integer(best_chain_nodes[N-1-j]);\n                }\n                free(best_chain_nodes);\n            }\n\n            // Free part1 arrays\n            free(a);\n            free(b);\n            free(num);\n            free(st);\n\n            // Part2: the second program\n            // We have: N, and an array `arr` of N integers.\n            // But note: if N==0, then we skip reading integers?

But note: the first program uses x as an index without bounds check? \n\n        In the first program: \n            int x = b[i]; \n            then in the while condition: \n                while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] != 1)\n\n            If x is not in [0, n]? then st[x] would be out of bounds? \n\n        But the problem states: the arrays a and b are of size n+1, and the b[i] are in the range [0, n]? \n\n        So we assume 0<=b[i]<=n.\n\n        We already built num for indices in [0, n]. And st is also of size n+1 (index 0..n).\n\n        But note: if x==0, then we break. And we have condition x!=0 in the while.\n\n        So in C, we break if x==0, and we also check x>=1 and x<=n for accessing st and num? Actually, we break on x==0, so the condition st[x] and num[x] are only evaluated when x>=1 and x<=n.\n\n        We can change the while condition to:\n\n            while (x != 0 && x>=1 && x<=n && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1)\n\n        But note: the first program does not check bounds? it assumes x in [0,n]. We are given that, so we can skip the bounds check? \n\n        However, the frequency array `num` is built only for values in [0, n]. And st is for [0, n]? but we don't use st[0]? because we break on x==0.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1)\n\n        But if x is outside [1, n], then st[x] would be out of bounds. But we assume x in [0, n]. And we break on x==0.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1)\n\n        And we hope x is in [1, n]. Since we built the frequency array for [0, n] and st for [0, n], and the input guarantees b[i] in [0, n], then it's safe.\n\n   Therefore, we remove the bounds check in the while condition.\n\n   Final code for part1 chain traversal:\n\n        while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x]==1 && a[x]!=1) {\n            st[x] = 1;\n            chain[count++] = x;\n            x = b[x];\n        }\n\n   But note: if x is 0, we break. And if x is not 0, then it must be in [1, n] by the input.\n\n   We'll assume that.\n\n   Let me test with a small example.\n\n   However, note: the second part might have issues with reversing integers: \n        For example, node=100: reverse_integer(100) returns 1? \n        But the first program: \n            It would convert 100 to string: \"100\", then reverse to \"001\", then the second program reads that as 1.\n\n        So our reverse_integer function returns 1 for 100.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Also, node=10: returns 1? \n        But 10 reversed is \"01\" -> which is 1.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Note: the second program's stack algorithm: we did:\n\n        // For the leftl and rightl arrays: we did the same as the Java code.\n\n   But note: the Java code for the second program uses:\n\n        ArrayDeque<Integer> que = new ArrayDeque<>();\n\n        // For the rightl:\n        index=0;\n        while (index < N) {\n            while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n                int ind = que.poll();\n                rightl[ind] = index - ind - 1;\n            }\n            que.push(index++);\n        }\n        while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n            int ind = que.poll();\n            rightl[ind] = N - ind - 1;\n        }\n\n        Then for the leftl:\n        index = N-1;\n        while (index >=0) {\n            while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n                int ind = que.poll();\n                leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n            }\n            que.push(index--);\n        }\n        while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n            int ind = que.poll();\n            leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;   // but at this point, index is -1? \n        }\n\n   In our C code for the leftl cleanup:\n\n        while (top != -1) {\n            int ind = stack[top--];\n            leftl[ind] = ind; // because we set: ind - (-1) - 1 = ind+1-1 = ind?\n        }\n\n   But wait: the formula is: ind - index - 1, and index is the current value? \n\n   In the Java code, the while loop for the leftl: \n        index starts at N-1 and then goes down to 0, then index-- makes it -1? \n        Then in the cleanup: \n            leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) - 1 = ind.\n\n   So our C code: leftl[ind] = ind, is correct.\n\n   However, the Java code: \n        leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n        In the cleanup, index is still -1? \n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But note: in the second part, we do:\n\n        // For the leftl: \n        top = -1;\n        index = N-1;\n        while (index >=0) {\n            while (top != -1 && arr[stack[top]] > arr[index]) {\n                int ind = stack[top--];\n                leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n            }\n            stack[++top] = index--;\n        }\n        while (top != -1) {\n            int ind = stack[top--];\n            leftl[ind] = ind;   // because at this point, index is -1? \n        }\n\n   But note: the variable `index` in the cleanup is the value after the loop? which is -1.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let me run a small example for the second part to be sure.\n\n   Example: [2, 1, 3] (N=3)\n\n        We want to compute: \n            for 2: \n                left: [2] -> leftl[0] = 0 (only itself) -> actually, the number of consecutive to the left including itself that are >=2: only itself -> so the count of consecutive to the left that are >=2 until a smaller is found? \n                The algorithm for leftl: \n                    We are computing the number of elements to the left of i that are >= a[i] until we hit a smaller one? \n                    Actually, the algorithm: \n                        leftl[i] = the number of elements strictly between the first element to the left that is smaller and the current element? \n\n                    The formula: \n                        total for a[i] is: (left_count+1) * (right_count+1) \n                    where left_count = number of contiguous elements to the left that are >= a[i] (not including the smaller one) and similarly to the right.\n\n                For i=0 (value=2):\n                    left: no element to the left -> so left_count = 0? but leftl[0] = 0? \n                    But the algorithm: \n                        In the leftl array: \n                            We do the left pass from right to left? \n                            We start at index=2 (value=3): \n                                stack: push 2.\n                            Then index=1 (value=1): \n                                while: stack not empty and arr[2]=3 > 1 -> pop 2: \n                                    leftl[2] = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0? \n                                then push 1.\n                            Then index=0 (value=2): \n                                while: stack not empty and arr[1]=1 < 2? -> so we break? \n                                then push 0.\n                            Then cleanup: \n                                pop 0: leftl[0] = 0? \n                                pop 1: leftl[1] = 1? \n                    But the expected: \n                        For 2 at index0: \n                            left: nothing -> so we can take [0:0] -> one subarray?
