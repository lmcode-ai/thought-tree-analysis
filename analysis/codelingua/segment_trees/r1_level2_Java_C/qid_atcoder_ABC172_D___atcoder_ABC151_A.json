    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC172_D):\n  Reads an integer `n`.\n  Computes: \n      ans = 0\n      for i from 1 to n:\n          ans += i * (n // i) * ((n // i) + 1) / 2\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  Reads a string (but in the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number).\n  Then it prints the character that is the next character of the first character of the input string.\n\nHowever, note that the output of the first program is a number (a long) and the second program expects a string.\n\nBut the chain is: \n  Input to the first program: an integer (say N)\n  Output of the first program: a string representation of a long (say S)\n  Input to the second program: the string S (which is a number) and then it reads the first character of that string and outputs the next character.\n\nBut note: the second program only reads one line and takes the first character. So if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program will take the first character '1' and then output the next character, which is '2'.\n\nHowever, let's reconsider the entire chain:\n\nExample:\n  Input to the chain: \n      First program: reads integer 1 -> computes ans = 1 -> outputs \"1\"\n  Then the second program: \n      reads \"1\", then takes the first character '1' (which is ASCII 49) and then adds 1 -> 50, then prints the character with ASCII 50 -> '2'\n\nBut what if the first program outputs a number with multiple digits? \n  For example, if the first program outputs \"10\", then the second program will take the first character '1' and output the next character, which is '2'. \n\nSo the entire chain does:\n  Step1: Compute a long integer from the input n (using the formula in the first program)\n  Step2: Convert that long integer to a string (which is the output of the first program, and becomes the input to the second program)\n  Step3: Take the first character of that string, and then output the character that is the next one in the ASCII table.\n\nHowever, note that the second program is named atcoder_ABC151_A and it is a simple program that reads a string and prints the next character of the first character. But in the chain, the input to the second program is the string output of the first.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n  Input: an integer n (from standard input)\n  Step 1: Compute the sum as in the first program -> let the result be `ans` (a long)\n  Step 2: Convert `ans` to a string -> this string is the input to the next program.\n  Step 3: Take the first character of that string, and then output the character that is the next character (i.e., the character with ASCII code one higher).\n\nHowever, note that the second program also has a class `RemRing` that is defined but not used in the main. We can ignore it because it is not used.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs the number without any extra spaces (just the number). Then the second program reads the entire line and takes the first character.\n\nSo the chain:\n\n  Input: integer n\n  Step1: compute F(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} i * (floor(n/i)) * (floor(n/i)+1) / 2\n  Step2: let S = string representation of F(n)\n  Step3: if S is non-empty, output the character that is S[0] + 1 (in terms of the character code). If S is empty, then we have nothing? But the first program will at least output \"0\" for n=0? We assume nonnegative n.\n\nBut note: the first program reads an integer and the problem says the input is to the first program. The second program is designed for a single character? Actually, the second program reads a string and then takes its first character.\n\nSo we must do:\n\n  Read n (as an integer) from stdin.\n  Compute the value `ans` (as a long) using the formula from the first program.\n  Convert `ans` to a string (without any extra characters, just the digits).\n  Then take the first character of that string and output the next character.\n\nBut note: what if the number is negative? The first program uses nonnegative n (since it's a divisor sum). The problem says the same input, so we assume n>=1? Actually the first program starts from i=1 to n (so n must be at least 1). But the problem doesn't specify, so we assume nonnegative.\n\nHowever, the second program: \n  It does: s = r.readLine(); \n  Then: s.charAt(0) -> which is the first character. Then adds 1 (which is an integer addition) and then prints as a character.\n\nBut note: the expression `s.charAt(0) + 1` is of type `int` (because char is promoted to int). Then we cast to char? Actually, the `printf` uses `%c` so it converts the integer to the corresponding character.\n\nBut in C, we can do the same.\n\nSteps in C:\n\n  Step 1: Read an integer `n`.\n  Step 2: Compute the sum (using the same formula as the first Java program). Use `long long` for `ans` because the number can be large.\n  Step 3: Convert the long long `ans` to a string (using `sprintf` or similar).\n  Step 4: Take the first character of the string (if the string is not empty) and then output the next character (i.e., the character with ASCII code one greater).\n\nEdge: if the string is empty? But `ans` is at least 0, so the string will have at least one digit.\n\nBut what if `ans` is 0? Then the string is \"0\", and then the next character of '0' is '1'? Actually, the next character in the ASCII table: '0' is 48, then 49 which is '1'. So output '1'.\n\nBut note: what if the number is a very large positive number? The first character might be a digit from '1' to '9'. Then we add 1 to the character code? \n\nExample: \n  If the first character is '9' (ASCII 57), then adding 1 gives 58 -> which is ':'. \n\nBut the original chain would do the same.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\n\nTherefore, we do:\n\n  Read n (an integer).\n  Compute the sum as in the first program (using a loop from 1 to n).\n  Convert the result (a long long) to a string.\n  Then take the first character of that string and output the character that is one higher.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain only outputs the next character of the first character and nothing else. It does not output a newline? Actually, in the second Java program: `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)` does not output a newline. So we should output exactly one character without a newline.\n\nBut the first program outputs the number and then a newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println(ans);` which outputs the number and then a newline. However, the second program reads the entire line (with `readLine`) which would include the newline? Actually, `readLine` in Java returns the line without the newline. So the string `s` in the second program does not include the newline.\n\nBut in our chain, the output of the first program is the string representation of the number and a newline? Then the second program would read the entire line including the digits and the newline? Actually, no: `readLine` in Java consumes the line and returns the string without the newline. So the string `s` is the digits without the newline.\n\nHowever, when we chain the programs, the first program outputs the number and a newline. Then the second program reads from the same standard input stream, which now has the number and a newline. But the second program's `readLine` reads until the newline and returns the string without the newline. So the string is just the digits.\n\nTherefore, in our C program, we must mimic:\n\n  Step 1: Read n (with scanf, etc.)\n  Step 2: Compute the value (without any I/O in between)\n  Step 3: Convert the value to a string (without a newline) and then extract the first character and then output the next character.\n\nBut note: the entire chain does not output the intermediate value (the number) to the user? Actually, the chain does output the intermediate value as the input to the next program. But we are combining into one program so we don't output the intermediate value. We just use it to compute the final output.\n\nSo we skip the step of printing the intermediate number and then reading it again. Instead, we compute the intermediate number and then convert it to a string in memory, then take the first character and compute the next character.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      // Step 1: Compute the value as in the first Java program\n      long long ans = 0;\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n          long long t = n / i;   // This is floor(n/i)\n          ans += (long long)i * t * (t + 1) / 2;\n      }\n\n      // Now convert ans to a string\n      // We need to determine the number of digits to allocate space\n      // Maximum number of digits: 20 for a 64-bit integer\n      char buffer[21]; // 20 digits + null terminator\n      sprintf(buffer, \"%lld\", ans);\n\n      // Now, take the first character of the string (if the string is not empty)\n      if (buffer[0] == '\\0') {\n          // This should not happen because ans is at least 0, but safe\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n      // Compute the next character\n      char next_char = buffer[0] + 1;\n\n      // Output the next_char (without any newline, as the second Java program does)\n      printf(\"%c\", next_char);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut wait: the second Java program outputs only one character and nothing else. The original second program does not output a newline. So we output exactly one character.\n\nHowever, note that the first Java program outputs the number and a newline. But in the chain, the second program reads the line (without the newline) and then outputs a character without a newline. So the total output of the chain is:\n  [the number]\\n[then the next character] \n\nBut wait, no: the first program outputs the number and a newline, and then the second program outputs a character without a newline. So the overall output of the chain is the number, a newline, and then a character.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\".\n\nSo in the combined program, we should not output the intermediate number. Only the last output (the next character) should be output.\n\nTherefore, we do not output the intermediate number at all. We only output the final character.\n\nSo the chain's observable output is just the final character? \n\nBut the original chain produces two outputs: the first program outputs the number and then the second program outputs the character. So the entire chain output is the number and then the character.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". So we must output both? \n\nHowever, the problem states: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that in the combined C program, we should only have one output at the end. But note that the intermediate output (the number) is fed as input to the next program. It is not meant to be the final output. The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the final output of the entire chain is the output of the last program.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output that we see when running both programs is the output of the second program. The intermediate output (the number) is not shown to the user? \n\nBut actually, when we run two programs in a chain:\n\n  $ java First | java Second\n\nThe output of the first program is passed to the second, and then the output of the second is what the user sees. So the user only sees the output of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output is the output of the last program.\n\nSo we only need to output the character at the end.\n\nBut wait: what about the newline from the first program? The second program reads the entire line (which is the number without the newline) and then outputs a character without a newline. So the user sees the output without a newline? \n\nExample: \n  First program: outputs \"123\\n\"\n  Second program: reads \"123\", then outputs the next character of '1' -> '2'. \n  The user sees: \"2\" (without a newline).\n\nTherefore, the combined program should output only \"2\" (without a newline).\n\nBut the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must output without a newline.\n\nHowever, in the second Java program, it uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not output a newline.\n\nSo the C program should output the character without a newline.\n\nBut note: the C program's output might be buffered and not appear without a newline? That's a system issue. We are to output the same bytes.\n\nTherefore, the C program should output exactly one byte (the next character) without any newline.\n\nBut what if we run the C program in a terminal? It might not flush the output. To be safe, we can flush, but the problem does not specify. However, the original second program does not flush explicitly. We can rely on the normal program termination flushing.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid buffering issues by not buffering stdout, but that is heavy. Instead, we can just flush at the end? But the program ends right after, so it will flush.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Read n.\n  Compute the sum.\n  Convert to string.\n  Extract first char and compute next char.\n  Print the next char (without newline) and exit.\n\nBut note: what if the number is 0? Then the string is \"0\", then we output '1'. That is correct.\n\nWhat if the number is 9? Then the string is \"9\", then we output ':' (which is the next character after '9').\n\nThis matches the chain.\n\nTherefore, the C code:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      long long ans = 0;\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n          long long t = n / i;   // integer division\n          ans += (long long)i * t * (t + 1) / 2;\n      }\n\n      // Convert the answer to a string\n      char buffer[21]; // enough for 64-bit integer\n      sprintf(buffer, \"%lld\", ans);\n\n      // If the buffer is empty, we avoid undefined behavior\n      if (strlen(buffer) == 0) {\n          // This should not happen, but for safety\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n      // The next character of the first digit\n      char next = buffer[0] + 1;\n      putchar(next);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nNote: we use `putchar` to output a single character without any formatting.\n\nBut note: the original second program uses `printf` with `%c` which is equivalent.\n\nHowever, we must consider the possibility of overflow in the character? The digits are from '0' to '9', and adding 1 gives the next ASCII character. This is well defined.\n\nBut what if the first character is not a digit? The number is nonnegative, so the string representation should be composed of digits only. So we are safe.\n\nLet's test with n=1:\n  Step1: ans = 1 * (1/1) * (1+1) / 2 = 1 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 1.\n  Then buffer = \"1\", then next character = '2'.\n\n  Output: '2'\n\nWith n=2:\n  i=1: 1 * (2/1=2) * (3) /2 = 1*2*3/2 = 3\n  i=2: 2 * (2/2=1) * (2) /2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2\n  total = 5 -> string \"5\", then next character = '6'\n\nBut wait, the first program for n=2:\n\n  The formula: \n      for i=1: 1 * (2) * (3) /2 = 3\n      for i=2: 2 * (1) * (2) /2 = 2\n      total = 5.\n\n  Then the second program: reads \"5\", then outputs the next character of '5' -> '6'\n\nSo output is '6'\n\nBut what if the number is 10? Then the string is \"10\", and the first character is '1', so we output '2'. The rest of the string is ignored.\n\nTherefore, the program is as below.\n\nNote: We are including the necessary headers.\n\nFinal code:"
