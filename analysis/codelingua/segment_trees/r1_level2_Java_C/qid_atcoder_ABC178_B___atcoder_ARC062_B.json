Step 2: Compute max_product = max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d)\nStep 3: Convert max_product to a string (using a buffer of sufficient size, e.g., 50 characters for a long long).

S = \"8\", which is one character. i=0: my = (0%2==0) -> 'g', his='8' -> different -> so add: my is 'g'? then subtract 1 -> score=-1. So that matches. Another example: negative number. Suppose the max_val = -5 -> string is \"-5\"\n    i0: my='g' (even), his='-' -> different -> score -=1 -> -1.\n    i1: my='p' (odd), his='5' -> different -> score +=1 -> 0.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC178_B):\n- Reads four long integers: a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3].\n- Computes the maximum of the products: a0*a2, a1*a3, a0*a3, a1*a2.\n- Outputs that maximum.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ARC062_B):\n- Reads a string S.\n- For each character in S (with index i):\n    - If i is even, the expected character (my) is 'g'\n    - If i is odd, the expected character (my) is 'p'\n- Compares with the actual character (his) from S.\n- If they differ:\n    - If my is 'p', then add 1 (because we are playing as p and lost? note: the problem is about a card game)\n    - If my is 'g', then subtract 1 (because we are g and we lost? actually the problem says: \n      \"In each round, if the card played by the opponent is ...\")\n- Outputs the total score.\n\nHowever, note the sequence: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs a single number (the maximum product) and the second program expects a string.\n\nHow do we connect them?\nWe must convert the long integer output of the first program into a string that the second program reads.\n\nTherefore, the entire process is:\n1. Read four long integers (a, b, c, d) from standard input.\n2. Compute max1 = max(a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c).\n3. Convert max1 to a string. This string becomes the input for the second program.\n4. For the second program, take the string and compute the score as described.\n\nBut note: the second program does not read multiple tokens? It reads one string (the entire next token). \nHowever, the first program outputs just one number (without any space) and then a newline? \nBut the second program uses `next()` which by default (with StringTokenizer) reads tokens without spaces? \nBut the first program outputs a single number and then a newline. The second program's `next()` would read the entire token until a space or newline? Actually, the first program only outputs one number and then a newline. The second program would read that number as a string? But note: the second program reads the entire next token? The tokenizer by default splits on whitespace. Since there's only one token, that token is the string representation of the number.\n\nSo the chain is:\nInput: four long integers (in one line? The first program reads them in a loop of 4, so they can be in one line or multiple? The first program uses `nextLong()` which reads tokens. The input should be four longs in one line or multiple lines.\n\nBut the second program then takes the output of the first as a string. The string is the decimal representation of the number.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n1. Read four long integers (a, b, c, d) from stdin. (We assume they are given in one line or four lines? But the original reads tokens, so we can read tokens in C.)\n2. Compute the maximum of the four products: a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c.\n3. Convert that maximum to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits).\n4. Then, process that string as in the second program: \n   - For each index i in the string:\n        if i is even, my = 'g'\n        if i is odd, my = 'p'\n        his = the character at i\n        if my != his:\n            if my == 'p', then score += 1\n            else (my == 'g') then score -= 1\n5. Output the score.\n\nImportant: the entire chain must be in one C program without any intermediate I/O (only the first block reads, only the last block writes).\n\nSteps in C:\n1. Read four long integers. We can use `scanf` for that.\n2. Compute the max of the four products. We can use `long long` to avoid overflow? The original Java uses long, so we use `long long` in C.\n3. Convert the max value to a string. We can use `snprintf` to write to a buffer.\n4. Then, iterate over the string (each character) and compute the score.\n5. Print the score.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses the entire string (which is the output of the first program). The first program outputs the number and then a newline? \nBut the second program's `next()` does not include the newline? It reads tokens (without surrounding whitespace). So the string S in the second program is the digits of the number without any newline.\n\nHowever, when we convert the number to a string, we don't want to include the newline. We just want the digits.\n\nBut note: the first Java program uses `System.out.println` which prints the number and then a newline. The second Java program uses `next()` which by default (with StringTokenizer) would not include the newline because the tokenizer skips leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nBut wait: the second program reads the entire next token. The token is the string of digits. The newline would be left in the buffer? But then the second program only reads one token? So the string S is the digits.\n\nTherefore, in our C program, when converting the number to a string, we do not include the newline. Then we process that string.\n\nHowever, the second program might have read the entire line? Actually, the second program uses `next()` which reads one token. So we only need the token (the digits) without the newline.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the number and a newline. The second program's `InputReader` uses `BufferedReader.readLine` only when building tokens? Actually, the `next()` method of `InputReader` in the second program reads tokens by reading a line and then tokenizing? But note: the `InputReader` in the second program:\n  - It has a `BufferedReader` that reads lines? The `next` method uses `StringTokenizer` that is created from a line. But if the tokenizer runs out of tokens, it reads the next line? However, the first program's output is only one token (the number) and then a newline. So the second program's `next()` would read that one token (the string of digits) and leave the newline? Actually, the tokenizer would break the input by lines and spaces. The token would be the digits.\n\nTherefore, in our C program, we must not include the newline in the string we process? Because the second Java program would see the token without the newline.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's output is \"12345\\n\"? The second program's `next()` returns \"12345\", without the newline.\n\nSo in our C program, we convert the number to a string without adding any extra newline. Then we process that string (which is the digits). Then we output the score.\n\nLet's design:\n\nStep 1: Read four long long integers.\nStep 2: Compute max_product = max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d)\nStep 3: Convert max_product to a string (using a buffer of sufficient size, e.g., 50 characters for a long long).\nStep 4: Process the string: \n    score = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++) {\n        char my = (i % 2 == 0) ? 'g' : 'p';\n        char his = s[i];\n        if (my != his) {\n            if (my == 'p') {\n                score++;\n            } else {\n                score--;\n            }\n        }\n    }\nStep 5: Print the score.\n\nBut note: the original second program uses 0-indexed: even indices (0,2,4,...) are 'g', odd indices (1,3,...) are 'p'.\n\nHowever, the string we have is the decimal representation of the number, e.g., \"12345\". We process each character in that string.\n\nBut what if the number is negative? The first program: the inputs are long, which in Java are signed. The problem states: \n    \"a, b, c, d: four integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9].\"\n\nBut the maximum product of two numbers in [-10^9, 10^9] can be as large as 10^18 (positive) or -10^18 (negative). \nAlso, the products might be positive or negative? But note: the maximum of the products: we are taking the maximum, which could be negative.\n\nIn the first program: \n    System.out.println(Math.max(a[0] * a[2], Math.max(a[1] * a[3], Math.max(a[0] * a[3], a[1] * a[2])));\n\nThis computes the maximum of four products. The maximum might be negative.\n\nHow do we convert a negative number to a string? We will get a minus sign at the beginning. For example, if the maximum is -5, the string is \"-5\".\n\nNow, the second program: it will process the string including the minus sign? \n  - The first character (index0) is '-', which is the first character. \n    my for index0: even index -> 'g'\n    his is '-'\n    they are different -> then we do: since my is 'g', we subtract 1.\n\nThen index1: odd index -> 'p', and his is '5'. They are different? Then we add 1.\n\nSo the score for \"-5\" would be: \n  index0: my='g', his='-' -> different -> score -= 1 -> score=-1\n  index1: my='p', his='5' -> different -> score += 1 -> score=0.\n\nBut note: the original chain: the first program outputs the number as a string. The second program reads the entire token. The token for a negative number is the string with the minus sign.\n\nSo we must convert the number to string including the minus sign if negative.\n\nTherefore, we can use `snprintf` which will handle the sign.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the number without any extra formatting? Yes, just the number and then a newline.\n\nSo in C, we do:\n    long long a, b, c, d;\n    scanf(\"%lld %lld %lld %lld\", &a, &b, &c, &d);\n\n    long long p1 = a * c;\n    long long p2 = b * d;\n    long long p3 = a * d;\n    long long p4 = b * c;\n\n    long long max_val = p1;\n    if (p2 > max_val) max_val = p2;\n    if (p3 > max_val) max_val = p3;\n    if (p4 > max_val) max_val = p4;\n\n    char buffer[50]; // 50 is enough for a long long (max 20 digits plus sign and null)\n    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%lld\", max_val);\n\n    Then process the buffer as described.\n\nBut note: the buffer does not include the newline. It's just the string representation.\n\nThen compute the score and print.\n\nEdge: if the max_val is 0, then the string is \"0\".\n\nLet's test with the example from the first problem: \n    Input: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4 -> max = max(1*3, 2*4, 1*4, 2*3) = max(3,8,4,6)=8 -> string \"8\"\n    Process the string \"8\": \n        i=0: even -> my='g', his='8' -> different -> score -= 1 -> score = -1.\n    Output: -1.\n\nBut what does the original second program do for the string \"8\"? \n    S = \"8\", which is one character.\n    i=0: my = (0%2==0) -> 'g', his='8' -> different -> so add: my is 'g'? then subtract 1 -> score=-1.\n\nSo that matches.\n\nAnother example: negative number.\n    Suppose the max_val = -5 -> string is \"-5\"\n    i0: my='g' (even), his='-' -> different -> score -=1 -> -1.\n    i1: my='p' (odd), his='5' -> different -> score +=1 -> 0.\n\nSo the C code:\n\nNote: We must include necessary headers.\n\nSummary of the C program:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>   // not needed? \n#include <stdlib.h> // for abs? not needed.\n\nint main() {\n    long long a, b, c, d;\n    scanf(\"%lld %lld %lld %lld\", &a, &b, &c, &d);\n\n    // Compute the four products\n    long long p1 = a * c;\n    long long p2 = b * d;\n    long long p3 = a * d;\n    long long p4 = b * c;\n\n    long long max_val = p1;\n    if (p2 > max_val) max_val = p2;\n    if (p3 > max_val) max_val = p3;\n    if (p4 > max_val) max_val = p4;\n\n    // Convert max_val to a string\n    char s[50]; \n    snprintf(s, sizeof(s), \"%lld\", max_val);\n\n    int score = 0;\n    int len = strlen(s);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char my = (i % 2 == 0) ? 'g' : 'p';\n        char his = s[i];\n        if (my != his) {\n            if (my == 'p') {\n                score++;\n            } else {\n                score--;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", score);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut note: what if the maximum value is the same for two products? We take the maximum, so it doesn't matter which one we choose because we are only using the value.\n\nBut note: the original first program computes the maximum correctly.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: integer overflow. The problem states the numbers are in [-10^9, 10^9]. The product of two such numbers is in the range [-10^18, 10^18]. The `long long` in C is typically 64-bit and can hold numbers from about -9e18 to 9e18, so it's safe.\n\nBut note: the multiplication of two long long: the inputs are read as long long, and the multiplication is long long * long long -> long long. So it's safe.\n\nLet me test with the maximum: 10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18, which is within the range of long long (which can go up to about 9.2e18).\n\nSo the code should be safe.\n\nOne more corner: if the max_val is the smallest possible? e.g., -10^18. Then the string will be 20 characters (including the minus) and then the 19 digits. Our buffer of 50 is safe.\n\nNow, what if the max_val is positive? The string will have up to 19 characters.\n\nSo we write the C program accordingly.\n\nBut note: the original first program might have used Math.max which works for negative numbers? Yes, because the problem says integers in that range.\n\nSo the program:\n\nWe'll write the C program as described."
