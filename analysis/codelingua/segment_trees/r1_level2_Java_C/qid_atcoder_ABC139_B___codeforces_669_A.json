Let x be the number of power strips. Then the total available sockets = 1 + (A-1)*x. We require 1 + (A-1)*x >= B. If A==1: then 1 + 0*x = 1. So if B>1, we cannot achieve it?

But note: the sample test cases: \n                    Input: A=1, B=1 -> output 0? But the code: \n                        (B-1) = 0, (A-1)=0 -> division by zero -> but in the code?

Actually, the constraints in the problem are 2<=A<=B? But the problem says: 1<=A<=B<=1000. How did the original code handle A==1? It would throw an exception. But looking at the sample tests: Input: 4 10 -> output 3\n                    Input: 8 9 -> output 2\n\n                And the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the values of A and B such that the answer exists. \"\n\n                So we can assume A>=2? Therefore, in our C program, we can assume A>=2? However, to be safe, we note that the problem is guaranteed that the answer exists, meaning A>=2? But the constraints say A>=1. Let me recalc: The formula: \n                        We require: 1 + (A-1)*x >= B\n                        => (A-1)*x >= B-1\n\n                    If A==1: \n                        then 0*x >= B-1 -> if B==1, then 0>=0 -> true for any x? but we want the minimum? then x=0?\n                        but the problem says: \n                            \"Determine the minimum number of power strips\"\n\n                        So if B==1, we need 0. But if A==1 and B>1, then 0>= (B-1) which is positive -> false. So no solution? But the problem guarantees that the answer exists. Therefore, we can assume that if A==1 then B==1. So in the code: \n                    if A==1, then we require 0? but then (B-1) would be 0? and we compute (0)/(0) -> undefined. We must handle A==1 separately. However, the original Java code does not handle A==1. It would crash. But the problem constraints: \"It is guaranteed that the answer exists\" and the constraints 1<=A<=B<=1000. How? If A==1, then B must be 1? because if B>1, then no solution. So we can assume that when A==1, then B==1. Then in that case: \n                    (B-1) = 0, (A-1)=0 -> then the division by zero?",

Actually, the problem context: The original problem: ABC139_B \n                    The sample: \n                        Input: 4 10 -> 3\n                        Input: 8 9 -> 2\n                        Input: 1 1 -> 0?

But the problem constraints: 1<=A<=B<=1000, and it is guaranteed that the answer exists. So the intended solution must avoid A==1? Actually, I found the original problem: \n                    https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc139/tasks/abc139_b\n\n                Constraints: 1 <= A <= B <= 1000. And the sample: Input: 4 10 -> 3\n                    Input: 8 9 -> 2\n                    Input: 1 1 -> 0? How do others solve? The common solution: \n                        int ans = (B + A - 3) / (A - 1);   // if A>1\n                    or \n                        if (B == 1) ans = 0;\n                        else ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);   // ceil((B-1)/(A-1)) But note: \n                    We can compute: \n                        if (A == 1) {\n                            ans = 0;   // because B must be 1? \n                        } else {\n                            ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);   // because ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)/b\n                        }\n\n                Why? \n                    ceil((B-1)/(A-1)) = (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1) [integer division rounding up]\n\n                Example: \n                    A=4, B=10: (9+2)/3 = 11/3 = 3 (if integer division truncates? but 11/3=3.666 -> truncates to 3? but we need 3? Actually, we want: \n                        10-1=9, 9/3=3 -> no remainder -> 3. But if we do (9+2)=11, 11/3=3 (if integer division truncates downward) -> then we need to use: \n                        (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) = (9+2)/3 = 11/3 -> 3.\n\n                    Example: A=4, B=9: \n                        (8+2)/3 = 10/3 -> 3 (but we need 3? because 3 strips: 1+3*3=10 -> which is >=9? But the original sample: 8 9 -> 2? Actually, for 8,9: \n                    We want: \n                        (9-1)=8, (8-1)=7 -> 8/7 -> 1 with remainder 1 -> then 2.\n\n                How to compute with the formula? (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) = (8+6)/7 = 14/7=2 -> that works. So the formula: \n                    ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) [if A>1]\n\n                But what if A==1? Then we avoid and set to 0? because the problem says the answer exists and when A==1 then B==1.\n\n                However, the problem says: \n                    \"It is guaranteed that the values of A and B are such that the answer exists. \"\n\n                So we can do: \n                    if (A == 1) \n                        ans = 0;\n                    else \n                        ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n\n                But note: integer division in C truncates toward zero. We want ceiling? (B-1 + A-2) = (B-1) + (A-2) -> then divided by (A-1). This is the same as: ceil((B-1)/(double)(A-1))? Actually, the formula for ceiling without floating point: \n                    ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) / b   [for positive integers]\n\n                Here, a = B-1, b = A-1.\n                    ceil((B-1)/(A-1)) = (B-1 + (A-1) - 1) / (A-1) = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) So the formula is correct. Therefore, the first program can be rewritten as:\n                    if (A == 1) \n                        n = 0;\n                    else \n                        n = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n\n                And then this n becomes the input for the second program. 2. The second program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n and then computes:\n        result = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1);\n\n    What does this do?",

We want to use as many 1's and 2's as possible? but alternating. The optimal is to use the pattern: 1,2,1,2,... Then the total for k days: \n                    if k is even: k/2 * 3\n                    if k is odd: (k-1)/2 * 3 + 1\n\n                We require that the total <= n? but we want exactly n? Actually, we can use the pattern and then adjust the last day? The problem does not require the entire pattern? we can choose the starting point arbitrarily? Actually, we can start with 1 or 2? But the problem does not specify. The sample: \n                    n=1: use 1 -> 1 day.\n                    n=2: use 2 -> 1 day? because 2 is one day? but if we do 1 and then 1 is not allowed? so we must do 2? -> 1 day.\n                    n=3: 1+2 -> 2 days.\n                    n=4: 2+1+1? -> not allowed. 1+2+1 -> 3 days? -> total 4. So the formula in the code: \n                    (n/3)*2 + (n%3==0?0:1)\n\n                Let me test:\n                    n=1: (1/3)=0 -> 0*2=0, then +1 (because n%3=1 ! =0) -> 1 -> correct.\n                    n=2: (2/3)=0 -> 0*2=0, then +1 -> 1 -> correct. n=3: (3/3)=1 -> 1*2=2, then +0 -> 2 -> correct. n=4: (4/3)=1 -> 1*2=2, then +1 (because 4%3=1) -> 3 -> correct. n=5: (5/3)=1 -> 2, then +1 -> 3 -> but what is the pattern? 5: 1+2+1+1 -> not allowed? 2+1+2 -> 3 days -> total 5? -> so 3 days -> the formula gives 3 -> correct.\n                    n=6: (6/3)=2 -> 4, then +0 -> 4 -> but pattern: 1+2+1+2 -> 4 days -> total 6 -> correct. So the formula is: \n                    result = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1);\n\n                But note: (n % 3 !=0) -> then we add 1.\n\n                We can write: \n                    result = (n/3)*2; if (n % 3 != 0) \n                        result++; However, note: \n                    if n%3==1: we add 1 -> that accounts for one extra day? if n%3==2: we add 1 -> but actually, for n=2: we get 1 day -> which is (2/3)=0, then add 1 -> 1. But wait, for n=5: \n                        5/3=1 -> 2 days from the multiples of 3? then we have 5%3=2 -> so we add 1 -> total 3? But why not add 2? Explanation: \n                    The pattern: \n                        We break n into groups of 3: \n                            Each group of 3 gives two days: because 1+2 = 3 -> two days. Then the remainder:\n                            If the remainder is 1: then we can add one day of 1? -> but note: we can do that at the beginning? Example: 1 + (then groups of 3: 1+2, 1+2, ...) -> but the last run was 2? then we cannot put a 1? because we have a 2 then 1 is allowed? Actually, we can also put at the end? But the problem does not require consecutive? However, the formula counts: \n                                total days = 2*(number of groups) + (if remainder>0 then 1) -> why one for any non-zero remainder?\n\n                    Actually, the remainder can be 1 or 2? If remainder is 1: we can have one extra day (with 1 km) -> but note: if we have groups, the last run in a group is 2? then we can do 1? -> so one extra day. If remainder is 2: we can have one extra day (with 2 km) -> but why not two days? Because if we do one day of 2 km? that covers 2 km -> so one extra day. However, we cannot do two days for 2 km? because then we would have two consecutive days of 1? Actually, we can do: For remainder 2: \n                                We can do: 2 (one day) -> that's one day? OR we can do: 1 and then 1? -> not allowed? So we can only do one day for 2 km? Therefore, the formula is: For each full group (3 km) we have 2 days -> 2*(n/3) Then if there is a remainder, we can only use one day to cover the entire remainder?",

But if A==1, then we require an infinite number? \n        However, the problem says: \"Takahashi's house has only one socket\". So if A==1, then we can only have one outlet? \n        Then we need to cover B outlets. But the problem states: \n            \"Determine the minimum number of power strips required.\"\n\n        In the original problem: \n            - If A==1, then we require B sockets? But each power strip adds A sockets and uses one? \n            Actually, the first power strip gives A sockets (but one is used to plug into the wall). \n            Then each additional power strip adds A-1 sockets.\n\n        So: \n            if A==1: \n                we can never get more than 1 outlet? unless we use multiple. But note: \n                if we use x power strips, then the total outlets = 1 + (A-1)*x.\n                So if A==1, then we have 1 outlet regardless of x. Therefore, if B>1, then it's impossible? \n                But the problem says: \"if we have one power strip, we have 1 outlet (from the house) and then the power strip gives 1 outlet? \n                Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"A power strip with A sockets has one plug (which goes into a socket) and A sockets (which can be used for appliances or other power strips).\"\n\n                So if A==1, then we have: \n                    Initially: 1 socket (the house)\n                    After one power strip: we use the house socket to plug the power strip -> then we have A (which is 1) available socket? \n                    But then we cannot plug any more? \n\n                Therefore, if B==1, then we need 0 power strips? \n                But the problem says: \n                    \"We want to have B available sockets.\"\n\n                Actually, the house has one socket. So without any power strip, we have 1 socket.\n\n                How many power strips do we need? \n                    Let x be the number of power strips.\n                    Then the total available sockets = 1 + (A-1)*x.\n\n                We require 1 + (A-1)*x >= B.\n\n                If A==1: then 1 + 0*x = 1. So if B>1, we cannot achieve it? But the problem constraints say B>=1.\n\n                However, the original problem (ABC139_B) states: \n                    Constraints: 1<=A<=B<=1000.\n\n                So A==1 and B>=1? Then if B==1, then x=0. If B>1, then we need infinite? \n\n                But note: the sample test cases: \n                    Input: A=1, B=1 -> output 0? \n                    But the code: \n                        (B-1) = 0, (A-1)=0 -> division by zero -> but in the code? \n\n                The code: \n                    result = (B-1)/(A-1);   // if A==1, then division by zero -> exception.\n\n                Therefore, we must note that the constraints say A>=2? Actually, the constraints in the problem are 2<=A<=B? \n                But the problem says: 1<=A<=B<=1000.\n\n                How did the original code handle A==1? \n                    It would throw an exception.\n\n                But looking at the sample tests: \n                    Input: 4 10 -> output 3\n                    Input: 8 9 -> output 2\n\n                And the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the values of A and B such that the answer exists.\"\n\n                So we can assume A>=2? \n\n                Therefore, in our C program, we can assume A>=2? \n\n                However, to be safe, we note that the problem is guaranteed that the answer exists, meaning A>=2? \n\n                But the constraints say A>=1. \n\n                Let me recalc: \n                    The formula: \n                        We require: 1 + (A-1)*x >= B\n                        => (A-1)*x >= B-1\n\n                    If A==1: \n                        then 0*x >= B-1 -> if B==1, then 0>=0 -> true for any x? but we want the minimum? then x=0?\n                        but the problem says: \n                            \"Determine the minimum number of power strips\"\n\n                        So if B==1, we need 0.\n\n                    But if A==1 and B>1, then 0>= (B-1) which is positive -> false. So no solution? \n                    But the problem guarantees that the answer exists.\n\n                Therefore, we can assume that if A==1 then B==1.\n\n                So in the code: \n                    if A==1, then we require 0? but then (B-1) would be 0? and we compute (0)/(0) -> undefined.\n\n                We must handle A==1 separately.\n\n                However, the original Java code does not handle A==1. It would crash.\n\n                But the problem constraints: \"It is guaranteed that the answer exists\" and the constraints 1<=A<=B<=1000.\n\n                How? \n                    If A==1, then B must be 1? because if B>1, then no solution. \n                    So we can assume that when A==1, then B==1.\n\n                Then in that case: \n                    (B-1) = 0, (A-1)=0 -> then the division by zero? \n\n                Alternatively, we can note that the problem says: \n                    \"We have a power strip with A outlets\" and \"We want to have at least B available outlets\".\n\n                And the house has one outlet. \n\n                So if A==1 and B==1: we don't need any power strip -> result=0.\n\n                But the code: \n                    result = (0)/(0) -> undefined.\n\n                Therefore, we must fix the code to handle A==1.\n\n                Actually, the problem context: \n                    The original problem: ABC139_B \n                    The sample: \n                        Input: 4 10 -> 3\n                        Input: 8 9 -> 2\n                        Input: 1 1 -> 0? \n\n                How did the original author handle it? \n                    The code: \n                        result = (B-1) / (A-1);\n                        amari = (B-1) % (A-1);\n                        if (amari !=0) result++;\n\n                For A=1, B=1: \n                    (B-1)=0, (A-1)=0 -> division by zero -> exception.\n\n                But the problem constraints: 1<=A<=B<=1000, and it is guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\n                So the intended solution must avoid A==1? \n\n                Actually, I found the original problem: \n                    https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc139/tasks/abc139_b\n\n                Constraints: 1 <= A <= B <= 1000.\n\n                And the sample: \n                    Input: 4 10 -> 3\n                    Input: 8 9 -> 2\n                    Input: 1 1 -> 0? \n\n                How do others solve? \n                    The common solution: \n                        int ans = (B + A - 3) / (A - 1);   // if A>1\n                    or \n                        if (B == 1) ans = 0;\n                        else ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);   // ceil((B-1)/(A-1))\n\n                But note: \n                    We can compute: \n                        if (A == 1) {\n                            ans = 0;   // because B must be 1? \n                        } else {\n                            ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);   // because ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)/b\n                        }\n\n                Why? \n                    ceil((B-1)/(A-1)) = (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1)   [integer division rounding up]\n\n                Example: \n                    A=4, B=10: (9+2)/3 = 11/3 = 3 (if integer division truncates? but 11/3=3.666 -> truncates to 3? but we need 3? \n                    Actually, we want: \n                        10-1=9, 9/3=3 -> no remainder -> 3.\n                    But if we do (9+2)=11, 11/3=3 (if integer division truncates downward) -> then we need to use: \n                        (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) = (9+2)/3 = 11/3 -> 3.\n\n                    Example: A=4, B=9: \n                        (8+2)/3 = 10/3 -> 3 (but we need 3? because 3 strips: 1+3*3=10 -> which is >=9? \n                        But the original sample: 8 9 -> 2? \n\n                Actually, for 8,9: \n                    We want: \n                        (9-1)=8, (8-1)=7 -> 8/7 -> 1 with remainder 1 -> then 2.\n\n                How to compute with the formula? \n                    (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) = (8+6)/7 = 14/7=2 -> that works.\n\n                So the formula: \n                    ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1)   [if A>1]\n\n                But what if A==1? \n                    Then we avoid and set to 0? because the problem says the answer exists and when A==1 then B==1.\n\n                However, the problem says: \n                    \"It is guaranteed that the values of A and B are such that the answer exists.\"\n\n                So we can do: \n                    if (A == 1) \n                        ans = 0;\n                    else \n                        ans = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n\n                But note: integer division in C truncates toward zero. We want ceiling? \n                    (B-1 + A-2) = (B-1) + (A-2) -> then divided by (A-1). \n                    This is the same as: ceil((B-1)/(double)(A-1))?\n\n                Actually, the formula for ceiling without floating point: \n                    ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) / b   [for positive integers]\n\n                Here, a = B-1, b = A-1.\n                    ceil((B-1)/(A-1)) = (B-1 + (A-1) - 1) / (A-1) = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1)\n\n                So the formula is correct.\n\n                Therefore, the first program can be rewritten as:\n                    if (A == 1) \n                        n = 0;\n                    else \n                        n = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n\n                And then this n becomes the input for the second program.\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n and then computes:\n        result = (n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1);\n\n    What does this do?\n        It counts the number of days to cover n kilometers if you can do 1 or 2 km per day, but you cannot do the same distance two days in a row? \n        Actually, the problem: \n            https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/669/A\n\n        The problem: \n            \"In n consecutive days, you can run at most two days in a row? and you want to run as many days as possible, alternating between 1 and 2 km?\"\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"He wants to run as much as possible, but he also wants to have at least one day of rest between two running days.\"\n\n        But the problem statement in the code: \n            \"We are given n, and we want to compute the maximum number of days such that the total distance is n and we alternate between 1 and 2 km per day, starting with 1, then 2, then 1, etc.\"\n\n        Actually, the sample: \n            n=1 -> 1 day (1 km) -> output 1.\n            n=2 -> 1 day (2 km) OR 2 days (1+1? but then two consecutive 1's? not allowed) -> actually, the problem says: \n                \"He cannot run the same distance for two or more consecutive days.\"\n\n            So for n=2: he can run one day of 2 km -> then 1 day -> output 1? \n            But the sample: \n                Input: 3 -> output 2: because 1+2 = 3, and two days.\n\n            How about n=4: \n                Option1: 1,2,1 -> total=4? but that would be 3 days? -> 3 days? \n                But the problem: \n                    \"He wants to run exactly n kilometers.\"\n\n                The problem: \n                    \"In the first sample, n=3: the maximum number of days is 2: because he runs 1 on the first day, then 2 on the second day? and then rests? and that totals 3.\"\n\n                How about n=4?\n                    Option: 1,2,1 -> total 4 -> 3 days? \n                    But note: the problem says: \n                        \"He cannot run the same distance for two consecutive days.\"\n\n                    So 1,2,1 is allowed? \n\n                Therefore, the formula: \n                    The pattern: 1,2,1,2,... \n                    The total for k days: \n                        if k is even: k/2 * (1+2) = k*3/2\n                        if k is odd: (k-1)/2 * 3 + 1 = (3*(k-1))/2 + 1\n\n                    We want the maximum k such that the total <= n? \n                    Actually, the problem says: \"exactly n\", so we have to use a combination of 1 and 2 to sum to n.\n\n                But the problem does not say \"exactly\" but \"in total\"? \n\n                Actually, the problem: \n                    \"He wants to run a total of exactly n kilometers.\"\n\n                So we are allowed to choose the distances arbitrarily (1 or 2) as long as no two consecutive are the same? \n\n                However, the problem also says: \n                    \"He wants to run as many days as possible.\"\n\n                How to maximize the days? \n                    We want to use as many 1's and 2's as possible? but alternating.\n\n                The optimal is to use the pattern: 1,2,1,2,... \n\n                Then the total for k days: \n                    if k is even: k/2 * 3\n                    if k is odd: (k-1)/2 * 3 + 1\n\n                We require that the total <= n? but we want exactly n? \n\n                Actually, we can use the pattern and then adjust the last day? \n\n                The problem does not require the entire pattern? we can choose the starting point arbitrarily? \n\n                Actually, we can start with 1 or 2? \n\n                But the problem does not specify. \n\n                The sample: \n                    n=1: use 1 -> 1 day.\n                    n=2: use 2 -> 1 day? because 2 is one day? but if we do 1 and then 1 is not allowed? so we must do 2? -> 1 day.\n                    n=3: 1+2 -> 2 days.\n                    n=4: 2+1+1? -> not allowed. \n                         1+2+1 -> 3 days? -> total 4.\n\n                So the formula in the code: \n                    (n/3)*2 + (n%3==0?0:1)\n\n                Let me test:\n                    n=1: (1/3)=0 -> 0*2=0, then +1 (because n%3=1 !=0) -> 1 -> correct.\n                    n=2: (2/3)=0 -> 0*2=0, then +1 -> 1 -> correct.\n                    n=3: (3/3)=1 -> 1*2=2, then +0 -> 2 -> correct.\n                    n=4: (4/3)=1 -> 1*2=2, then +1 (because 4%3=1) -> 3 -> correct.\n                    n=5: (5/3)=1 -> 2, then +1 -> 3 -> but what is the pattern?

0 : 1);\n\n                But note: (n % 3 !=0) -> then we add 1.\n\n                We can write: \n                    result = (n/3)*2;\n                    if (n % 3 != 0) \n                        result++;\n\n                However, note: \n                    if n%3==1: we add 1 -> that accounts for one extra day? \n                    if n%3==2: we add 1 -> but actually, for n=2: we get 1 day -> which is (2/3)=0, then add 1 -> 1.\n\n                    But wait, for n=5: \n                        5/3=1 -> 2 days from the multiples of 3? then we have 5%3=2 -> so we add 1 -> total 3? \n                    But why not add 2? \n\n                Explanation: \n                    The pattern: \n                        We break n into groups of 3: \n                            Each group of 3 gives two days: because 1+2 = 3 -> two days.\n                        Then the remainder:\n                            If the remainder is 1: then we can add one day of 1? -> but note: we can do that at the beginning? \n                                Example: 1 + (then groups of 3: 1+2, 1+2, ...) -> but the last run was 2? then we cannot put a 1? because we have a 2 then 1 is allowed? \n                                Actually, we can also put at the end? \n                                But the problem does not require consecutive? \n                            However, the formula counts: \n                                total days = 2*(number of groups) + (if remainder>0 then 1) -> why one for any non-zero remainder?\n\n                    Actually, the remainder can be 1 or 2? \n                        If remainder is 1: we can have one extra day (with 1 km) -> but note: if we have groups, the last run in a group is 2? then we can do 1? -> so one extra day.\n                        If remainder is 2: we can have one extra day (with 2 km) -> but why not two days? \n                            Because if we do one day of 2 km? that covers 2 km -> so one extra day.\n\n                    However, we cannot do two days for 2 km? because then we would have two consecutive days of 1? \n                        Actually, we can do: \n                            For remainder 2: \n                                We can do: 2 (one day) -> that's one day? \n                                OR we can do: 1 and then 1? -> not allowed? \n                        So we can only do one day for 2 km? \n\n                    Therefore, the formula is: \n                        For each full group (3 km) we have 2 days -> 2*(n/3)\n                        Then if there is a remainder, we can only use one day to cover the entire remainder? because the remainder is either 1 or 2.\n\n                But wait: \n                    What if we break differently? \n                    For n=5: \n                        We could do: 2,1,2 -> which is 3 days? and that's the same as the formula: 2*(1) + 1 = 3.\n\n                So the formula is correct.\n\n 3. Now, the entire sequence:\n        Input: two integers A and B (from stdin)\n        Step1: compute n = (if A==1) 0 : (B-1+A-2)/(A-1)\n        Step2: then compute result = (n/3)*2 + (n%3==0?0:1)   [but note: if n==0? then we get: (0/3)*2=0, and then (0%3==0 -> 0) so 0?]\n\n        However, for A=1 and B=1: \n            Step1: n=0\n            Step2: result=0 -> output 0.\n\n        But what if the first program produces n=0? \n            Then the second program: \n                n=0: \n                    (0/3)*2 = 0, then 0%3==0 -> so result=0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n 4. The C program structure:\n        - Read two integers A and B from stdin.\n        - Compute n from the first program (without any I/O in between).\n        - Then compute the result from the second program using n.\n        - Print the result.\n\n 5. Edge: \n        The first program: \n            We assumed that when A==1, we set n=0. \n            But what if A==1 and B>1? \n                The problem guarantees the answer exists, so we assume B==1 in that case.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (A == 1) {\n                if (B == 1) {\n                    n = 0;\n                } else {\n                    // This should not happen by the problem guarantee, but to be safe?\n                    // Since the problem says the answer exists, we can assume B==1 when A==1.\n                    // But if we get A==1 and B>1, then we cannot compute? \n                    // We'll set n = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1) would crash by division by zero.\n                    // So we must avoid. Therefore, we do:\n                    n = (B == 1) ? 0 : ... // actually, we are told the answer exists so we assume only B==1 when A==1.\n                    // We'll do: \n                    n = 0;   // but if B>1, then 0 is not the correct n? \n                }\n            } else {\n                n = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n            }\n\n        However, the problem guarantee: \"the values of A and B such that the answer exists\" so we assume that when A==1, then B==1.\n\n        So we can simply do:\n            if (A == 1) {\n                n = 0;\n            } else {\n                n = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1);\n            }\n\n 6. Write the C code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n            // Step1: compute n from the first program\n            int n;\n            if (A == 1) {\n                n = 0;\n            } else {\n                n = (B - 1 + A - 2) / (A - 1);\n            }\n\n            // Step2: compute the result from the second program\n            int result = (n / 3) * 2;\n            if (n % 3 != 0) {\n                result++;\n            }\n\n            // Output the result\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n 7. Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example1: A=4, B=10 -> \n            n = (10-1+4-2) / (4-1) = (9+2)/3 = 11/3 = 3 (in integer division)\n            Then result = (3/3)*2 = 1*2 = 2, then 3%3==0 -> no increment -> result=2? \n            But the first program outputs 3? and then the second program would take 3 as input and output 2? \n            But the original first program outputs 3? and the second program is not applied to 3? \n\n        Wait! This is a chain: the output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\n        In the original chain:\n            First program: input (4,10) -> output 3.\n            Then the second program: input 3 -> output (3/3)*2 + (0? because 3%3==0 -> 0) = 2.\n\n        Therefore, the final output is 2.\n\n        But the original first program's output is 3? and then the second program outputs 2? so the entire chain outputs 2.\n\n        However, the original first program was designed to solve a problem and the second program a different problem.\n\n        So the chain: \n            Input: A, B -> first program outputs the number of power strips (say x) -> then the second program takes x and outputs the maximum number of days to run x km? \n\n        But that doesn't make sense in a real context? \n\n        But the problem says: \"translate the entire sequence\" meaning we chain the two programs.\n\n        Therefore, we output 2 for (4,10).\n\n        Now, example2: A=8, B=9 -> \n            n = (9-1+8-2)/(8-1) = (8+6)/7 = 14/7=2.\n            Then result = (2/3)*2 = 0*2=0, then 2%3 !=0 -> result=1.\n\n        Original chain: \n            First program: input (8,9) -> output 2.\n            Second program: input 2 -> output (2/3)*2 + (2%3!=0 -> 1) = 0+1 = 1.\n\n        So output 1.\n\n        Example: A=1, B=1 -> \n            n=0\n            result = (0/3)*2 = 0, then 0%3==0 -> no increment -> 0.\n\n        Example: n=1 (if we had a case that produces n=1) -> \n            result = (1/3)*2 = 0, then 1%3!=0 -> 1.\n\n        This matches the second program.\n\n 8. Therefore, the C program:\n\n        We read two integers: A and B.\n        Compute n as described.\n        Then compute the result as described.\n        Print result.\n\n Note: The second program in the original Java had a function solve(n) that printed the result. We are doing the same.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly."
