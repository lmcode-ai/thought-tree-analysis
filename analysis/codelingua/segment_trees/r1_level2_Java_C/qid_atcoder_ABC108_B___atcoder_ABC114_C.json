But note: the second Java program has a method to generate numbers starting from 357 and then transform the number to the next candidate. We must translate that algorithm to C.\n\nImportant: The second program in Java reads the integer N and then counts numbers that are <= N and that are composed of the digits 3,5,7 and contain each at least once. We must translate that algorithm exactly. Let's break down the second Java program:\n\n  - It starts with i = 357.\n  - While i <= N: Convert i to string: s. If s contains '3', '5', and '7', then increment the count c.\n        Then, it builds the next candidate number by:\n            Traverse the string from right to left (as j from 0 to len-1):\n                Let a = the j-th character from the right. If we haven't done any change (f is false), then:\n                    if a is '3', change it to '5' and set f=true.\n                    else if a is '5', change it to '7' and set f=true.\n                    else (a is '7'), change it to '3' (and leave f false, so we continue to the next digit). If we have already changed (f is true), then we leave the digit as is. If we didn't do any change in the entire loop (f remains false), then we append a '3' at the end? Actually, note: the loop builds the string in reverse. Then we reverse it again. Example: \n            Current number: 357 -> s = \"357\"\n            j=0: a = '7' (last digit) -> becomes '3' (and f remains false) -> so we continue to next digit. j=1: a = '5' -> becomes '7' and set f=true -> then the rest (if any) are just appended without change? But note: we break the loop? Actually, we continue for all digits? But the rest is the first digit: j=2: a='3' -> but we set f=true so we just append it? Actually, we are building a new string in reverse. How it builds: We start with an empty StringBuilder.\n            j=0: a='7' -> becomes '3' -> so we put '3' -> now the new string (in reverse) has \"3\"\n            j=1: a='5' -> becomes '7' -> then set f=true -> then we put '7' -> now the string is \"73\"\n            j=2: a='3' -> because f is true, we just append the same char -> so we put '3' -> now \"733\"\n            Then we reverse: \"337\", but that is not the next number.",

Let me check the code again:\n\n            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n                char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n                if (f) {\n                    sb.append(a);\n                } else {\n                    if (a == '3') {\n                        sb.append('5');\n                        f = true;\n                    } else if (a == '5') {\n                        sb.append('7');\n                        f = true;\n                    } else {\n                        sb.append('3');\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (!f) sb.append('3');\n\n        For 357:\n            j=0: a='7' -> else part: append '3', f remains false -> so sb becomes \"3\"\n            j=1: a='5' -> else part: append '7', f becomes true -> sb becomes \"37\"\n            j=2: a='3' -> because f is true, append '3' -> sb becomes \"373\"\n            Then reverse: \"373\" reversed is \"373\", but that is not 375. This seems incorrect? However, note the example in the problem: the next number after 357 is 375? Actually, the code might be generating 373? Then 373 is a valid number? It contains two 3's, one 7 -> but it doesn't contain 5? So it wouldn't be counted? Then the next candidate that would be counted is 375? But the algorithm doesn't skip numbers that don't have all digits? It just generates the next candidate in the sequence of numbers that use only 3,5,7. The algorithm is generating the next number in lexicographic order? Or in numerical order?",

Then we reverse to get \"373\" -> i=373. Then 373: \n            Check: \"373\" -> contains two 3's and a 7 -> no 5 -> skip.

Then 375: contains 3,7,5 -> so c becomes 1 (because we started at 357: c=1) then 375: c=2. But note: the first number 357 was counted? So the count c starts at 0, then at 357: c becomes 1, then 373: skip, then 375: c becomes 2. So the algorithm is generating 357, 373, 375, ... and counting the ones that have all three digits.",

Then when we finish, we have the new number with the least significant digit at the beginning of next_s and the most significant at the end? So to form the number, we must reverse next_s? Example: 357 -> we traverse: \n                    j=2: '7' -> becomes '3' -> next_s[0]='3'\n                    j=1: '5' -> becomes '7' -> next_s[1]='7'\n                    j=0: '3' -> becomes '3' (because f is true? Actually, we set f=true at j=1? No, in 357: we started with j=2: '7' -> becomes '3', then j=1: '5' becomes '7' and set f=1, then j=0: we just append '3'. So next_s becomes \"373\" (without quotes) and then we reverse to get \"373\" -> but that is the same as the original? Actually, we want 373? But 373 is the next candidate? However, the Java program does:\n\n                    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                    ... // we built the string in the order: from the last digit to the first?

Yes.

That is more than 2e9? So we break? But 3.3e9 does not fit in 32 bits? Then we get overflow? Therefore, we use long long to avoid overflow. Steps:\n\n          Change:\n            long long i = 357;\n            long long n_val = (long long)N;   // but note: N is int, so we can cast. Then in the sprintf: use %lld. And atol -> atoll? But atoll is for long long? Actually, we should use strtoll? But to avoid, we can use:\n\n            i = strtoll(next_s, NULL, 10); Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i);\n\n        But note: the string next_s is a string of digits, so it's positive. We'll use sscanf. Therefore, we update:\n\n          char s[20] -> increase to 25? to be safe for 20 digits? 20 is enough for 19 digits (long long max is about 1e19). Similarly, next_s[20] -> 25. Then:\n\n          long long i = 357;\n          long long n_val = (long long)N;\n\n          // in the loop:\n          sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n          // then after building next_s and reversing, we do:\n          sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i); Now, we write the final code. Note: we assume the input is four integers. Let's test with the sample: 0 0 0 1 -> N=-1 -> then the while loop doesn't run -> output 0. Another sample: Input: 0 0 0 0 -> then x3 = 0 + (0-0)=0, y3=0+(0-0)=0, x4=0+(0-0)=0, y4=0+(0-0)=0 -> N=0 -> then the while loop: 357>0 -> skip -> output 0. Another: Input: 1 2 3 4 -> \n            x3 = 3 + (2-4) = 3-2=1\n            y3 = 4 + (3-1)=4+2=6\n            Then N=1 -> then the while loop: 357>1 -> output 0. But let me compute the points: \n          (x1,y1)= (1,2), (x2,y2)=(3,4)\n          vec = (1-3, 2-4) = (-2,-2)\n          rotated: ( -2, 2) -> then newpos = (3,4) + (-2,2) = (1,6) -> so (1,6) -> then next point: \n          vec = (3-1, 4-6) = (2,-2)\n          rotated: (-2, -2) -> then newpos = (1,6) + (-2,-2) = (-1,4) Then the first program outputs:\n            1\n            6\n            -1\n            4\n\n          Then the second program would read the first integer 1 -> and output 0. So the chain outputs 0. Therefore, the C program outputs 0. Now, we write the code accordingly. Important: We must not output anything else. Code:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int x1, y1, x2, y2; scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n              int x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);\n              int y3 = y2 + (x2 - x1);\n              // We don't need x4, y4 for the next part, but we compute them anyway? The problem doesn't require it? But we do it for completeness? Actually, we only need x3.\n              // So we can skip x4,y4? // We only need x3 for N.\n\n              int N = x3;\n\n              // Counting algorithm for the second part\n              long long i = 357;\n              int c = 0;\n              long long n_val = (long long)N;   // cast to long long\n\n              // If n_val is less than 357, then we skip the loop? But the condition: i<=n_val -> 357<=n_val? if n_val<357, then the loop doesn't run. char s[25];   // buffer for string conversion\n              char next_s[25]; // for building next candidate\n\n              while (i <= n_val) {\n                  // Convert i to string\n                  sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n                  int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n                  for (int j = 0; s[j]!='\\0'; j++) {\n                      if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n                  }\n                  if (has3 && has5 && has7) {\n                      c++;\n                  }\n\n                  // Build next candidate\n                  int len = strlen(s);\n                  int f = 0;\n                  int idx = 0;\n                  // Traverse from last char to first\n                  for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                      char a = s[j];\n                      if (f) {\n                          next_s[idx++] = a;\n                      } else {\n                          if (a=='3') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '5';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else if (a=='5') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '7';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else { // a=='7'\n                              next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                              // f remains 0\n                          }\n                      }\n                  }\n                  if (!f) {\n                      next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                  }\n                  next_s[idx] = '\\0';\n\n                  // Reverse next_s\n                  for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                      char t = next_s[j];\n                      next_s[j] = next_s[idx-1-j];\n                      next_s[idx-1-j] = t;\n                  }\n\n                  // Parse next_s to i\n                  sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i);\n              }\n\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n              return 0;\n          } We assume that the input is always four integers. This is the entire program. Note: The second program in the chain uses the first integer (x3) of the first program's output. We do not output the intermediate values. We only output the count c. We hope that this matches the intended chain. Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, this is the best we can do.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. The output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_ABC108_B):\n  - Reads four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n  - Computes two more points (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) such that:\n        (x3, y3) = revpos((x1,y1), (x2,y2))\n        (x4, y4) = revpos((x2,y2), (x3,y3))\n  - Then it checks if (x1,y1) is the same as revpos((x3,y3), (x4,y4))? (but note: in Java, array == is reference equality, so this check is broken. However, in the problem we don't rely on that check for output because we always output the computed points)\n  - Outputs the four integers: x3, y3, x4, y4 (each on a new line)\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC114_C):\n  - Reads an integer N.\n  - Counts numbers that are <= N, composed only of digits 3,5,7 and contain each of 3,5,7 at least once. The numbers are generated in a specific way starting from 357 and then by a transformation that increments the number in a base-3-like system (with digits 3,5,7).\n\nHowever, note the requirement: the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program without I/O in the middle. The first block (which corresponds to the first Java program) should read the input (four integers) and then the second block (second Java program) should take the output of the first as its input.\n\nBut wait: the output of the first program is four integers (x3, y3, x4, y4) each on a new line. However, the second program only reads one integer (N). This mismatch indicates that we must reconsider.\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads one integer (N) and then counts the numbers. But the output of the first program is four integers. How are we to connect them?\n\nWe must note that the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (four integers) becomes the input to the second program? But the second program only reads one integer. This does not match.\n\nTherefore, we must reexamine the problem. The problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut the two programs are independent? The first program outputs four integers, the second expects one integer. There is a disconnect.\n\nHowever, note the context: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". It is possible that the example provided is two separate programs that are not meant to be chained? Or maybe we have to run the first program and then use one of its outputs as the input to the second? The problem does not specify which output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we have to design the entire chain. Since the first program outputs four integers and the second program expects one integer, we must use only one of the four integers as the input to the second program? But which one?\n\nLooking at the first program: it reads four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) and then outputs four integers (x3, y3, x4, y4). The second program reads an integer N and then does its counting.\n\nBut the problem does not specify which part of the output is the input to the next. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The entire output of the first program is the input to the next? But that is four integers, and the next program only reads one.\n\nThis suggests that the example might be flawed? Or perhaps we are to use the first integer of the output? But that is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, we must consider that the second program might be intended to run on the first integer of the output? But the problem does not specify.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We have two programs. The first program's output is four integers. The second program's input is one integer. How can we chain them? We must use only one of the four integers? But which one?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program is run multiple times? That doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will make an assumption: the problem expects that the first program's output is four integers, and the second program is to be run with the first integer of that output as N. Why the first? Because that is the first number printed. Alternatively, we could use the sum? But the problem does not specify.\n\nHowever, looking at the original problem context (if we recall the problems from AtCoder):\n\n  - ABC108_B: \"Ruined Square\" - Given two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), it outputs the other two points (x3,y3) and (x4,y4) to form a square. The output is x3, y3, x4, y4.\n\n  - ABC114_C: \"755\" - Counts the numbers that are composed of digits 3,5,7 and contain each at least once and are <= N.\n\nThere is no inherent connection between these two problems. Therefore, it is likely that the example is provided as two separate programs that are to be run in sequence, but the output of the first (four integers) is not meant to be the input of the second (which expects one integer). This is a problem.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must design a chain. The only way to resolve is to use the first integer of the first program's output as the input to the second program? But that would be x3. Alternatively, we could use the maximum of the four? Or the sum? The problem does not specify.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I will assume that the problem intended that the first program's output is to be fed entirely to the second program. But the second program only reads one integer. So we must change the second program to read four integers? But that would change its behavior.\n\nAlternatively, we could note that the second program in the chain should be able to read the four integers and then use one of them? But that is not what the second Java program does.\n\nThis seems to be an error in the problem setup. However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nWithout knowing the intended chain, it's impossible to proceed. But note: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". The example set has two programs. The first program outputs four integers. The second program, if run immediately after, would read from standard input which is now the four integers. However, the second program's first call is `gi()` which reads one integer. So it would read the first integer and leave the rest in the buffer. Then the next `gi()` would try to read the next integer, but there isn't one? Actually, the second program only reads one integer (N) and then does not read any more.\n\nSo the second program would read the first integer of the four and ignore the rest? Then the output of the chain would be the output of the second program.\n\nBut the original chain would be:\n  Input to the entire chain: four integers (x1,y1,x2,y2) for the first program.\n  Output of first program: four integers (x3,y3,x4,y4) (each on a new line).\n  This becomes the input to the second program.\n  The second program reads the first integer (x3) as N, and then counts the numbers for N=x3, and outputs the count.\n\nSo the entire chain: input: four integers, output: one integer (the count).\n\nTherefore, the C program should:\n  - Read four integers (x1,y1,x2,y2).\n  - Compute the four integers (x3,y3,x4,y4) as in the first program.\n  - Then use the first of these (x3) as the input N to the second program.\n  - Then run the counting algorithm of the second program for N=x3 and output the count.\n\nBut note: the first program also outputs the four integers? In the chain, the second program only uses the first one. However, the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated without I/O in the middle. So we are not to output the intermediate four integers? Only the final output (the count) is to be printed.\n\nTherefore, we can skip printing the intermediate four integers. We just compute them and then use the first one (x3) as the input to the second part.\n\nBut wait: what if the second program was intended to use a different integer? The problem does not specify. However, the second program reads one integer and that integer is the first integer of the available input. So in the chain, it is x3.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended that the entire output of the first program is to be passed as a whole to the second program and then the second program would read all four, we would have to change the second program to read four integers and then do something? But the second program only uses one integer. So we must use one of them.\n\nGiven the above, we design the C program as:\n\n  Step 1: Read the four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n  Step 2: Compute (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) as in the first Java program.\n  Step 3: Let N = x3 (the first of the four computed integers).\n  Step 4: Run the counting algorithm of the second Java program for this N and output the count.\n\nBut note: the second Java program has a method to generate numbers starting from 357 and then transform the number to the next candidate. We must translate that algorithm to C.\n\nImportant: The second program in Java reads the integer N and then counts numbers that are <= N and that are composed of the digits 3,5,7 and contain each at least once.\n\nWe must translate that algorithm exactly.\n\nLet's break down the second Java program:\n\n  - It starts with i = 357.\n  - While i <= N:\n        Convert i to string: s.\n        If s contains '3', '5', and '7', then increment the count c.\n        Then, it builds the next candidate number by:\n            Traverse the string from right to left (as j from 0 to len-1):\n                Let a = the j-th character from the right.\n                If we haven't done any change (f is false), then:\n                    if a is '3', change it to '5' and set f=true.\n                    else if a is '5', change it to '7' and set f=true.\n                    else (a is '7'), change it to '3' (and leave f false, so we continue to the next digit).\n                If we have already changed (f is true), then we leave the digit as is.\n            If we didn't do any change in the entire loop (f remains false), then we append a '3' at the end? Actually, note: the loop builds the string in reverse. Then we reverse it again.\n\n        Example: \n            Current number: 357 -> s = \"357\"\n            j=0: a = '7' (last digit) -> becomes '3' (and f remains false) -> so we continue to next digit.\n            j=1: a = '5' -> becomes '7' and set f=true -> then the rest (if any) are just appended without change? But note: we break the loop? Actually, we continue for all digits? But the rest is the first digit: j=2: a='3' -> but we set f=true so we just append it? Actually, we are building a new string in reverse.\n\n        How it builds:\n            We start with an empty StringBuilder.\n            j=0: a='7' -> becomes '3' -> so we put '3' -> now the new string (in reverse) has \"3\"\n            j=1: a='5' -> becomes '7' -> then set f=true -> then we put '7' -> now the string is \"73\"\n            j=2: a='3' -> because f is true, we just append the same char -> so we put '3' -> now \"733\"\n            Then we reverse: \"337\", but that is not the next number.\n\n        Actually, the transformation is intended to increment the number in a base-3 system with digits 3,5,7. The next number after 357 should be 375.\n\n        Let me check the code again:\n\n            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n                char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n                if (f) {\n                    sb.append(a);\n                } else {\n                    if (a == '3') {\n                        sb.append('5');\n                        f = true;\n                    } else if (a == '5') {\n                        sb.append('7');\n                        f = true;\n                    } else {\n                        sb.append('3');\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (!f) sb.append('3');\n\n        For 357:\n            j=0: a='7' -> else part: append '3', f remains false -> so sb becomes \"3\"\n            j=1: a='5' -> else part: append '7', f becomes true -> sb becomes \"37\"\n            j=2: a='3' -> because f is true, append '3' -> sb becomes \"373\"\n            Then reverse: \"373\" reversed is \"373\", but that is not 375.\n\n        This seems incorrect? However, note the example in the problem: the next number after 357 is 375? Actually, the code might be generating 373? Then 373 is a valid number? It contains two 3's, one 7 -> but it doesn't contain 5? So it wouldn't be counted? Then the next candidate that would be counted is 375? But the algorithm doesn't skip numbers that don't have all digits? It just generates the next candidate in the sequence of numbers that use only 3,5,7.\n\n        The algorithm is generating the next number in lexicographic order? Or in numerical order? Actually, it's generating the next number by incrementing in a base-3 system with digits 3,5,7, but the digits are in increasing order: 3<5<7.\n\n        How it should work: \n          We start from the least significant digit:\n            If we see a 3, we change it to 5 and stop (like carry over not needed).\n            If we see a 5, we change it to 7 and stop.\n            If we see a 7, we change it to 3 and then we have a carry to the next digit.\n\n        So 357:\n          Start from the last digit: 7 -> change to 3 and carry -> then next digit: 5 -> becomes 7 and stop -> so we get 373? \n          But 373 is 373, which is less than 375? But 373 is a valid number? However, the problem requires the numbers to contain 3,5,7 at least once. 373 does not contain 5, so it won't be counted? But the algorithm still generates it.\n\n        The algorithm does not skip non-valid numbers? It just generates the next number in the sequence of numbers that use only 3,5,7. Then we check at each step if the number is valid (has 3,5,7) and then count.\n\n        So the algorithm is correct: it will generate 357, 373, 375, 377, 533, ... \n\n        Therefore, we must translate the algorithm exactly.\n\n        Steps for the second part:\n\n          long i = 357;\n          int c = 0;\n          while (i <= N) {\n            Convert i to a string s.\n            Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, c++.\n            Then, build the next candidate:\n              Let f = false (meaning no carry has been handled yet).\n              Let sb be a string (initially empty) that will hold the new number in reverse order (least significant digit first).\n              For each digit in the current number from right to left:\n                 If we have already handled a carry (f is true), then we just append the current digit without change.\n                 Else:\n                    if the digit is '3', change it to '5' and set f=true (meaning we handled a carry at this digit, no more carry propagation).\n                    else if the digit is '5', change it to '7' and set f=true.\n                    else (digit is '7'), change it to '3' and leave f=false (so we must propagate the carry to the next digit on the left).\n              If after processing all digits we still haven't handled the carry (f is false), then we append an additional '3' at the end (which in the reversed string is the most significant digit? But note: the string we are building is in reverse order, so we are building from least significant to most. The additional '3' will become the new most significant digit? Actually, when we reverse, it becomes the most significant digit?).\n\n            Then reverse the string we built and parse it as a long.\n\n          Then output c.\n\n        Example: 357 -> becomes 373? Then 373: \n          Check: has 3 and 7, but no 5 -> skip (c not incremented).\n          Then build next: \n            s = \"373\"\n            j=0: a='3' (last digit) -> becomes '5' and set f=true -> then the rest are just appended without change? \n            j=1: a='7' -> because f is true, we append '7'\n            j=2: a='3' -> append '3'\n            So we get \"573\" (in reverse: initially we appended '5', then '7', then '3') -> then reverse to \"375\"\n          Then i = 375.\n\n        Then 375: has 3,7,5 -> count becomes 1? (but wait, we started at 357 and that was counted? Actually, the first number 357 was counted? So at 357: c=1, then 375: c=2?).\n\n        Actually, the code does:\n\n          i = 357 -> c becomes 1 (because 357 contains 3,5,7) -> then next candidate is built as 375? (but we just saw that 357 becomes 373? Then 373 becomes 375?).\n\n        So the algorithm for the next candidate:\n\n          s = \"357\": \n            j=0: last digit '7' -> becomes '3' and f=false -> so we append '3'\n            j=1: digit '5' -> becomes '7' and f=true -> so we append '7'\n            j=2: digit '3' -> because f=true, we append '3' -> so we have \"373\" (but that is the reverse of the new number? Then we reverse to get \"373\" -> i=373.\n\n        Then 373: \n            Check: \"373\" -> contains two 3's and a 7 -> no 5 -> skip.\n            Then build next: \n                j=0: a='3' (last digit of \"373\") -> becomes '5', f=true -> then append the rest: \n                j=1: a='7' -> because f=true, append '7'\n                j=2: a='3' -> because f=true, append '3'\n                So we get \"573\" -> reverse to \"375\", so i=375.\n\n        Then 375: contains 3,7,5 -> so c becomes 1 (because we started at 357: c=1) then 375: c=2.\n\n        But note: the first number 357 was counted? So the count c starts at 0, then at 357: c becomes 1, then 373: skip, then 375: c becomes 2.\n\n        So the algorithm is generating 357, 373, 375, ... and counting the ones that have all three digits.\n\n        Now, we must translate this to C.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll read the four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\n          Then compute (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) as:\n\n            vec = (p - q) for two points p and q? Actually, the function revpos:\n\n              vec = (p[0]-q[0], p[1]-q[1])\n              then rotate vec by 90 degrees counterclockwise: (vec[1], -vec[0])\n              then newpos = q + rotated_vec.\n\n            So for the first call: \n                p = (x1,y1), q = (x2,y2)\n                vec = (x1-x2, y1-y2)\n                rotated_vec = (y1-y2, -(x1-x2)) = (y1-y2, x2-x1)\n                then newpos = (x2 + (y1-y2), y2 + (x2-x1)) = (x2 + y1 - y2, y2 + x2 - x1)\n\n            Then the second call: \n                p = (x2,y2), q = (x3,y3)\n                vec = (x2-x3, y2-y3)\n                rotated_vec = (y2-y3, x3-x2)\n                then newpos = (x3 + (y2-y3), y3 + (x3-x2)) = (x3+y2-y3, y3+x3-x2)\n\n          Then we set N = x3 (the first integer of the computed point (x3,y3)).\n\n          Then we run the counting algorithm for N.\n\n        However, note: the first program also outputs the four integers? But we are not outputting them. We are only using x3. And then we output the count.\n\n        But what about the rest? The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of the first program is the input to the next\". We are using only the first integer of the output. The problem does not specify which part to use, so we assume the first integer.\n\n        Alternatively, if the problem intended that the entire output (four integers) is to be passed and then the second program would read the first integer, then that is what we are doing.\n\n        Now, we write the C program.\n\n        Important: The first Java program also had a check:\n\n            if (position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3])) {\n                System.out.println(\"OK\");\n            }\n\n        But note: in Java, this checks if two array references are equal? That is always false. So it never prints \"OK\". Therefore, we can ignore that.\n\n        Steps in C:\n\n          Step 1: Read four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\n          Step 2: Compute:\n                x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);\n                y3 = y2 + (x2 - x1);\n                x4 = x3 + (y2 - y3);\n                y4 = y3 + (x3 - x2);\n\n          But wait: the second call uses the point (x3,y3) we just computed? And then:\n\n                vec = (x2 - x3, y2 - y3)\n                rotated_vec = (y2-y3, x3-x2)\n                then x4 = x3 + (y2 - y3)\n                     y4 = y3 + (x3 - x2)\n\n          However, note: the first call: \n                revpos( (x1,y1), (x2,y2) ) -> returns (x3,y3) = (x2 + (y1-y2), y2 + (x2-x1))\n\n          Then the second call: \n                revpos( (x2,y2), (x3,y3) ) -> returns (x4,y4) = (x3 + (y2 - y3), y3 + (x3 - x2))\n\n          Then we set N = x3.\n\n          Step 3: Run the counting algorithm for N.\n\n        But note: what if x3 is negative? The second program counts numbers that are positive? The algorithm in the second program starts at 357 and goes up. So if N is less than 357, then the count is 0.\n\n        Now, we write the C code.\n\n        We must be cautious about the types: the second program uses long for i (since numbers can be up to 10^9). So we use long for i and for the number representation.\n\n        However, note: the first program uses integers for the coordinates. The input for the first program is integers. The second program uses a long for i and for N? Actually, the second program reads N as an integer (gi() returns int). But then it sets i to 357 (long) and compares i<=N (which is int). This might be a problem? In Java, the int N is promoted to long? Yes.\n\n        But in C, we should use long for N? Because the numbers we generate might be large? The problem says N can be up to 10^9? The input to the second program is the first integer from the first program's output (x3). But x3 is computed from integers. We can assume that x3 is within int range? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The first program uses int, so the coordinates are int. Then we set N = x3 (which is an int). Then in the second program, we can use long for the counting algorithm (because the generated numbers might be larger than int? but note: the input N is an int, so the generated numbers are at most 10^9, which fits in a 32-bit int? Actually, 10^9 is 1e9 which is less than 2^31, so we can use int for N? But the algorithm uses long for i? Because when we build the next candidate, we might have numbers that are 10 digits? So we use long.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n          int x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);\n          int y3 = y2 + (x2 - x1);\n          int x4 = x3 + (y2 - y3);\n          int y4 = y3 + (x3 - x2);\n\n          int N = x3;   // the first integer of the computed point (x3,y3)\n\n          Then run the counting algorithm for N.\n\n        But note: what if the computed x3 is negative? The algorithm in the second program uses a while loop that starts at 357 and goes up. So if N < 357, the while loop condition fails and the count is 0.\n\n        Now, the counting algorithm in C:\n\n          long i = 357;\n          int c = 0;\n\n          while (i <= (long)N) {   // note: N is int, but i is long. We compare as long to avoid overflow? But N is int so we can cast to long.\n\n          However, note: the second program uses `i <= N` and N is int, but in Java, if N is very large (like 2e9) and i is long, it works. In C, we must cast N to long? Because if N is negative, then i (which is 357) is greater than N? But if N is positive and large (like 2e9) then we are comparing long and int? In C, the int will be promoted to long? So we can write: while (i <= (long)N) ... but actually, we can also do: while (i <= N) and let N be promoted to long? But N is int. However, to avoid any overflow in the condition (if N is INT_MAX, then i might be larger? but then the condition fails) we can do:\n\n          long n_val = (long)N;   // to avoid issues if N is negative? and for consistency.\n\n          Then: while (i <= n_val) { ... }\n\n          Steps for the counting algorithm:\n\n            Convert i to a string? But in C, we don't have a direct way. We can use sprintf? But note: the maximum number of digits? The maximum i is n_val which is at most 2e9? Actually, the input N is an int, so at most 2e9? Then the number of digits is at most 10. We can use a fixed-size buffer.\n\n            We'll use:\n\n                char s[20];   // enough for 19 digits?\n                sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n\n            Then check: we need to check if the string s contains '3', '5', and '7'. We can do:\n\n                int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n                for (int j=0; s[j]!='\\0'; j++) {\n                    if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n                    if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n                    if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n                }\n                if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n            Then, build the next candidate:\n\n                We'll create a buffer for the new number? We'll build it in reverse.\n\n                We'll use:\n\n                    char next_s[20];   // we'll build the reversed string here.\n                    int len = strlen(s);\n                    int f = 0;   // flag for carry handled, false initially.\n                    int idx = 0; // index in next_s\n\n                    // Traverse the original string from last char to first.\n                    for (int j = len-1; j >=0; j--) {\n                        char a = s[j];\n                        if (f) {\n                            next_s[idx++] = a;\n                        } else {\n                            if (a=='3') {\n                                next_s[idx++] = '5';\n                                f = 1;\n                            } else if (a=='5') {\n                                next_s[idx++] = '7';\n                                f = 1;\n                            } else { // a=='7'\n                                next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                                // f remains 0 -> carry propagates\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    // If after all digits we still have f==0, then we add a '3' at the end (which in the reversed string is the most significant? Actually, we are building from least significant to most? But we traversed from the last digit (least significant) to the first (most significant). So we are building the new number in the order: least significant first? Then we will reverse it to get the actual number? Actually, the Java program reverses the entire string at the end.\n\n                    if (!f) {\n                        next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                    }\n                    next_s[idx] = '\\0';\n\n                Then, we have to reverse the string next_s? Actually, the Java program does:\n\n                    StringBuilder sb = ...;   // which we built from least significant to most? Actually, we built by traversing from the last digit to the first? So the first character we put in next_s is the new least significant digit? Then the last character we put is the new most significant? But we are going to parse it as a number? We don't need to reverse? Because we built the number in the correct order? Actually, no: we built the new number in the same digit order as the original? \n\n                But note: the transformation is done digit by digit from right to left (least significant to most). We built the new number by replacing the least significant digit first? Then the next digit to the left? So the string we built is the new number in the same order as the original? Actually, no: the original number was stored in the string s in the usual order (most significant first). We traversed from the last digit (least significant) to the first (most significant). Then we built next_s by appending the transformed least significant digit, then the next to the left? Then when we finish, we have the new number with the least significant digit at the beginning of next_s and the most significant at the end? So to form the number, we must reverse next_s? \n\n                Example: 357 -> we traverse: \n                    j=2: '7' -> becomes '3' -> next_s[0]='3'\n                    j=1: '5' -> becomes '7' -> next_s[1]='7'\n                    j=0: '3' -> becomes '3' (because f is true? Actually, we set f=true at j=1? No, in 357: we started with j=2: '7' -> becomes '3', then j=1: '5' becomes '7' and set f=1, then j=0: we just append '3'. So next_s becomes \"373\" (without quotes) and then we reverse to get \"373\" -> but that is the same as the original? Actually, we want 373? But 373 is the next candidate? \n\n                However, the Java program does:\n\n                    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                    ... // we built the string in the order: from the last digit to the first? Then we do: \n                    StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n                    i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\n                So it reverses the string we built? Therefore, we must reverse the string next_s to get the actual number? \n\n                But note: in the example, we built \"373\" and then reversed it? Then we get \"373\"? Actually, the reverse of \"373\" is \"373\" because it's symmetric? So that is 373.\n\n                But what if we built \"573\" (as in the next candidate after 373)? Then reverse to \"375\", which is 375.\n\n                So we do:\n\n                    Reverse next_s to get the actual number string.\n\n                How to reverse? We can do:\n\n                    for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                        char t = next_s[j];\n                        next_s[j] = next_s[idx-1-j];\n                        next_s[idx-1-j] = t;\n                    }\n\n                Then parse next_s as a long? \n\n                    i = atol(next_s);   // but note: atol expects a string in the usual order? and we have reversed it to the usual order? Yes.\n\n          Step 4: Print the count c.\n\n        But note: the Java program does:\n\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n                char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j);   // starting from the last character\n                ... \n            }\n\n        We are doing:\n\n            for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                char a = s[j];\n                ... \n            }\n\n        This is equivalent: we are traversing from the last character to the first.\n\n        However, the Java program then appends the transformed digit to the StringBuilder. Then at the end, it reverses the entire StringBuilder? \n\n        Actually, the Java program does:\n\n            StringBuilder sb = ...;   // we built the string in the order: first the transformed least significant, then the next, ... and then if we append a '3' at the end, that becomes the new most significant in the reversed representation? But then it reverses the entire StringBuilder? \n\n        The reversal of the StringBuilder gives the string in the order: the last character we appended becomes the first? So if we built the string as: \n            digit0 (least significant), then digit1, ... digitk (most significant)\n        then reversing the StringBuilder gives: digitk, ... , digit0 -> which is the usual representation? \n\n        Therefore, we built the string in the order: least significant first? Then we reverse the entire string to get the usual representation? That is the same as we did: we built next_s in the order: least significant first? Then we reversed the entire next_s to get the usual representation? \n\n        So we are consistent.\n\n        However, note: in the Java program, if we have to add an extra '3' at the end, that extra '3' becomes the new most significant digit? In our code, we append it at the end of next_s (so it becomes the last character in next_s). Then when we reverse next_s, it becomes the first character? So it becomes the most significant? Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n        But note: what if the number has leading zeros? The transformation never produces a zero? The digits are only 3,5,7. So we are safe.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: if N is less than 357, then the while loop runs zero times? Then c=0.\n\n        Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n        Note: we assume that the input for the first program is four integers.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: 0 0 0 1\n          Then: \n            x1=0, y1=0, x2=0, y2=1.\n            x3 = 0 + (0-1) = -1\n            y3 = 1 + (0-0) = 1\n            Then N = -1 -> then the counting loop: i=357, but -1 is less than 357 -> so c=0 -> output 0.\n\n        But the first program would have output:\n          x3 = -1, y3 = 1, x4 = ...? \n          and then the second program would read the first integer -1 and output 0.\n\n        So the chain outputs 0.\n\n        We output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the C program:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              // Step 1: Read the four integers\n              int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n              // Step 2: Compute the four points\n              int x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);\n              int y3 = y2 + (x2 - x1);\n              int x4 = x3 + (y2 - y3);\n              int y4 = y3 + (x3 - x2);\n\n              // We only need x3 for the next part\n              int N = x3;\n\n              // Step 3: Counting algorithm\n              long i = 357;\n              int c = 0;\n              long n_val = (long)N;   // to avoid signed comparison issues and to match the type of i\n\n              // We'll use a buffer for converting numbers to string\n              char s[20];\n              char next_s[20];   // for building the next candidate\n\n              while (i <= n_val) {\n                  // Convert i to string\n                  sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n\n                  // Check if s contains '3','5','7'\n                  int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n                  for (int j=0; s[j]!='\\0'; j++) {\n                      if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n                  }\n                  if (has3 && has5 && has7) {\n                      c++;\n                  }\n\n                  // Build the next candidate\n                  int len = strlen(s);\n                  int f = 0;   // carry flag: 0 means not handled, 1 means handled\n                  int idx = 0; // index for next_s\n\n                  // Traverse the current string from last character to first (right to left)\n                  for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                      char a = s[j];\n                      if (f) {\n                          next_s[idx++] = a;\n                      } else {\n                          if (a=='3') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '5';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else if (a=='5') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '7';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else { // must be '7'\n                              next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                              // f remains 0 -> carry propagates\n                          }\n                      }\n                  }\n\n                  // If we still have carry to propagate, add a '3' at the end (which becomes the new most significant digit after reversal)\n                  if (!f) {\n                      next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                  }\n                  next_s[idx] = '\\0';\n\n                  // Now, reverse next_s to get the number in the usual order (most significant first)\n                  for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                      char t = next_s[j];\n                      next_s[j] = next_s[idx-1-j];\n                      next_s[idx-1-j] = t;\n                  }\n\n                  // Convert next_s to a long\n                  i = atol(next_s);\n              }\n\n              // Step 4: Output the count\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n        But note: what if the transformation produces a number that is not a valid number? For example, if we have a string that is not a number? But we are only using digits 3,5,7 and sometimes adding a '3', so it's safe.\n\n        However, what if the number has a leading zero? We never produce a zero? The digits are 3,5,7, so no zero.\n\n        But note: the transformation might produce a number that starts with '3'? That is allowed.\n\n        Let's test the counting algorithm with a small N? For example, N=400.\n\n          i=357 -> has 3,5,7 -> c=1.\n          Then build next: \n              s = \"357\"\n              j=2: a='7' -> becomes '3' -> then j=1: a='5' -> becomes '7' and set f=1 -> then j=0: a='3' -> because f=1, append '3' -> so next_s = \"373\" (in reverse order? Actually, we built the string by traversing from the last digit: \n                  j=2: '7' -> becomes '3' -> next_s[0]='3'\n                  j=1: '5' -> becomes '7' -> next_s[1]='7'\n                  j=0: '3' -> append '3' -> next_s[2]='3'\n              Then next_s = \"373\" -> then we reverse? It becomes \"373\", which is the same? Then i=373.\n\n          373: does not contain 5 -> c remains 1.\n          Then build next:\n              s = \"373\"\n              j=2: a='3' -> becomes '5' and set f=1 -> then j=1: a='7' -> append '7' -> j=0: a='3' -> append '3' -> so next_s = \"573\" (in the order: first the transformed j=2: '3'->'5' -> then j=1: append '7', then j=0: append '3') -> then reverse to \"375\" -> i=375.\n\n          375: has 3,5,7 -> c=2.\n          Then next:\n              s = \"375\"\n              j=2: a='5' -> becomes '7' and set f=1 -> then j=1: a='7' -> append '7' -> j=0: a='3' -> append '3' -> next_s = \"773\" -> reverse to \"377\" -> i=377.\n\n          377: has 3,7 -> no 5 -> skip.\n          Then next:\n              s = \"377\"\n              j=2: a='7' -> becomes '3' and f=0 -> then j=1: a='7' -> becomes '3' and f=0 -> then j=0: a='3' -> becomes '5' and f=1 -> then next_s = \"533\" (built as: j=2: '7'->'3'; j=1: '7'->'3'; j=0: '3'->'5') -> reverse to \"335\" -> but wait: we built the string in the order: \n                 j=2: '7' -> '3' -> next_s[0]='3'\n                 j=1: '7' -> '3' -> next_s[1]='3'\n                 j=0: '3' -> '5' -> next_s[2]='5'\n              Then reverse: becomes \"533\"? Actually, we reverse the entire next_s: \n                 We have next_s = \"335\" (as built) -> then reversing: \"533\" -> so i=533.\n\n          533: has 5 and 3, but no 7 -> skip.\n\n          Then next: ... until i>400.\n\n          Then c=2.\n\n        But the expected numbers <=400 that are valid: 357 and 375? So c=2.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm works.\n\n        However, note: the Java program does:\n\n            if (!f) sb.append(3);\n\n        And then reverses the entire StringBuilder? We do the same.\n\n        We'll run the above C program and test with the sample input.\n\n        But note: the first program also outputs the four integers? We are not outputting them. The problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we only output the final count.\n\n        Therefore, we output the count.\n\n        We write the entire program accordingly.\n\n        One more note: the Java program uses long for i. We use long for i. But the conversion to string: we use %ld in sprintf? Yes.\n\n        We assume that long is at least 64 bits? But the problem says N is at most 10^9? So long (32 bits) might be 2e9? But 10^9 is 1e9, so it fits. However, the generated numbers might be up to 10^10? But the input N is an int (so at most about 2e9). Then the condition i<=n_val will break when i becomes more than 2e9? So we are safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use long long? But the problem says the original Java program uses long, which is 64 bits? But in C, long might be 32 bits? On Windows, long is 32 bits? Then we need to use long long.\n\n        To be safe, we change:\n\n            long i = 357;   -> might be 32 bits? We want 64 bits? The problem says the numbers can be up to 10^9? But the counting algorithm might generate numbers that are 10^9? So 32-bit long might not be enough? Because 10^9 fits in 32 bits? 10^9 is 1e9, which is less than 2^31. But the algorithm might generate numbers with 10 digits? 10^10 is 10,000,000,000 which is 10e9, which is 10 billion? That does not fit in 32 bits? \n\n        Therefore, we should use long long for i and n_val? But note: the input N is an int. However, the generated numbers might be beyond the int range? But the condition is i<=n_val, and n_val is the same as N (an int). So the generated numbers are bounded by the int N? Then we can use long long for i? But we don't need to? Because if N is an int, then the maximum i we consider is at most the maximum int? But the transformation might generate numbers that are larger than N? But we break when i>N. However, the transformation might generate a number that is larger than the maximum int? But then we break because i>N? But if N is the maximum int, then the next candidate might be larger? Then we break? So we can use long long to avoid overflow? Because if we use 32-bit long, then i might overflow? \n\n        Example: N = 2000000000 (2e9). The next candidate after 1999999999? might be a number that is 2000000000? but we are generating numbers with digits 3,5,7? The next candidate might be 2000000000? Actually, no, the candidates are numbers with digits 3,5,7. The next candidate after 777777777 might be 3333333333? which is about 3.3e9? That is more than 2e9? So we break? But 3.3e9 does not fit in 32 bits? Then we get overflow? \n\n        Therefore, we use long long to avoid overflow.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Change:\n            long long i = 357;\n            long long n_val = (long long)N;   // but note: N is int, so we can cast.\n\n          Then in the sprintf: use %lld.\n\n          And atol -> atoll? But atoll is for long long? Actually, we should use strtoll? But to avoid, we can use:\n\n            i = strtoll(next_s, NULL, 10);\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i);\n\n        But note: the string next_s is a string of digits, so it's positive.\n\n        We'll use sscanf.\n\n        Therefore, we update:\n\n          char s[20] -> increase to 25? to be safe for 20 digits? 20 is enough for 19 digits (long long max is about 1e19).\n\n          Similarly, next_s[20] -> 25.\n\n        Then:\n\n          long long i = 357;\n          long long n_val = (long long)N;\n\n          // in the loop:\n          sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n          // then after building next_s and reversing, we do:\n          sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i);\n\n        Now, we write the final code.\n\n        Note: we assume the input is four integers.\n\n        Let's test with the sample: 0 0 0 1 -> N=-1 -> then the while loop doesn't run -> output 0.\n\n        Another sample: \n          Input: 0 0 0 0 -> then x3 = 0 + (0-0)=0, y3=0+(0-0)=0, x4=0+(0-0)=0, y4=0+(0-0)=0 -> N=0 -> then the while loop: 357>0 -> skip -> output 0.\n\n        Another: \n          Input: 1 2 3 4 -> \n            x3 = 3 + (2-4) = 3-2=1\n            y3 = 4 + (3-1)=4+2=6\n            Then N=1 -> then the while loop: 357>1 -> output 0.\n\n        But let me compute the points: \n          (x1,y1)= (1,2), (x2,y2)=(3,4)\n          vec = (1-3, 2-4) = (-2,-2)\n          rotated: ( -2, 2) -> then newpos = (3,4) + (-2,2) = (1,6) -> so (1,6) -> then next point: \n          vec = (3-1, 4-6) = (2,-2)\n          rotated: (-2, -2) -> then newpos = (1,6) + (-2,-2) = (-1,4)\n\n          Then the first program outputs:\n            1\n            6\n            -1\n            4\n\n          Then the second program would read the first integer 1 -> and output 0.\n\n        So the chain outputs 0.\n\n        Therefore, the C program outputs 0.\n\n        Now, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        Important: We must not output anything else.\n\n        Code:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n              int x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);\n              int y3 = y2 + (x2 - x1);\n              // We don't need x4, y4 for the next part, but we compute them anyway? The problem doesn't require it? But we do it for completeness? Actually, we only need x3.\n              // So we can skip x4,y4? \n              // We only need x3 for N.\n\n              int N = x3;\n\n              // Counting algorithm for the second part\n              long long i = 357;\n              int c = 0;\n              long long n_val = (long long)N;   // cast to long long\n\n              // If n_val is less than 357, then we skip the loop? But the condition: i<=n_val -> 357<=n_val? if n_val<357, then the loop doesn't run.\n\n              char s[25];   // buffer for string conversion\n              char next_s[25]; // for building next candidate\n\n              while (i <= n_val) {\n                  // Convert i to string\n                  sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n                  int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n                  for (int j = 0; s[j]!='\\0'; j++) {\n                      if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n                      if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n                  }\n                  if (has3 && has5 && has7) {\n                      c++;\n                  }\n\n                  // Build next candidate\n                  int len = strlen(s);\n                  int f = 0;\n                  int idx = 0;\n                  // Traverse from last char to first\n                  for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                      char a = s[j];\n                      if (f) {\n                          next_s[idx++] = a;\n                      } else {\n                          if (a=='3') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '5';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else if (a=='5') {\n                              next_s[idx++] = '7';\n                              f = 1;\n                          } else { // a=='7'\n                              next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                              // f remains 0\n                          }\n                      }\n                  }\n                  if (!f) {\n                      next_s[idx++] = '3';\n                  }\n                  next_s[idx] = '\\0';\n\n                  // Reverse next_s\n                  for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                      char t = next_s[j];\n                      next_s[j] = next_s[idx-1-j];\n                      next_s[idx-1-j] = t;\n                  }\n\n                  // Parse next_s to i\n                  sscanf(next_s, \"%lld\", &i);\n              }\n\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n        We assume that the input is always four integers.\n\n        This is the entire program.\n\n        Note: The second program in the chain uses the first integer (x3) of the first program's output. We do not output the intermediate values.\n\n        We only output the count c.\n\n        We hope that this matches the intended chain.\n\n        Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, this is the best we can do.\n\n        If the problem intended to use a different integer (like the sum of the four? or the last one?) we would have to adjust. But the problem says the output of the first program is the input to the next, and the next program reads one integer. In the chain, the next program reads the first integer of the available input.\n\n        Therefore, we use the first integer.\n\n        We output the code accordingly."
