How to do: traverse s1 and when we see \"BC\", replace with 'D' and skip the next character. Algorithm for replacement:\n\n          char s2[1000]; // but our s1 is at most 3, so 10 is enough. int j = 0;\n          int i = 0;\n          while (i < strlen(s1)) {\n            if (s1[i] == 'B' && i+1 < strlen(s1) && s1[i+1] == 'C') {\n                s2[j++] = 'D'; i += 2;\n            } else {\n                s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n            }\n          }\n          s2[j] = '\\0';\n\n   Then, we do the counting on s2.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n The first program (codeforces_49_A) reads a line of input and processes it to output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n The second program (atcoder_AGC034_B) reads a token (which would be the output of the first program) and then processes it.\n\n However, note the requirement: the entire sequence should be translated into a single C program without intermediate I/O.\n The first program's output becomes the second program's input.\n\n But note: the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program expects a string that may contain 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. and replaces \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\n How to reconcile?\n We must note that the second program is not designed to take \"YES\" or \"NO\" as input. This suggests that the chain might be broken.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem statement: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n However, the two programs are independent and the second program does not take the output of the first as its input? \n Actually, the first program reads from standard input and the second also reads from standard input. But when chaining, the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\n But the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is a string. The second program expects a string that can contain 'A', 'B', 'C', and then replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". \n\n How would we chain?\n Example: \n   Input to first program: a string (say, a question: \"How are you?\")\n   Output of first program: \"YES\" (if the last non-space, non-question mark character is a vowel or 'y') or \"NO\".\n\n Then the second program would take either \"YES\" or \"NO\" as its input.\n\n But what does the second program do?\n   It replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" in the entire string. Then it counts:\n      tmp = 0\n      traverse the string:\n        if char == 'A', then tmp++\n        else if char == 'D', then cnt += tmp\n        else (meaning if it's 'B' or 'C' or other? but note we replaced BC by D, and we also reset on anything else) then tmp=0.\n\n In the second program, if the input is \"YES\", then:\n   s = \"YES\" -> no \"BC\", so s remains \"YES\".\n   Then traverse:\n      'Y' -> not 'A' or 'D' -> tmp=0\n      'E' -> same -> tmp=0\n      'S' -> same -> tmp=0\n   cnt=0 -> output 0.\n\n Similarly, for \"NO\":\n   s = \"NO\" -> remains \"NO\", same process -> cnt=0.\n\n So the output of the entire chain would be 0 in both cases.\n\n But that doesn't make sense. It seems the two programs are not designed to be chained? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And note: the first program's input is the initial input. The second program's input should be the output of the first.\n\n But wait, the second program is designed for a different problem. \n\n Actually, the problem might be that the two programs are independent and meant to be run on the same original input? \n\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So the first program runs on the initial input and produces output1. Then the second program runs on output1 and produces output2.\n\n However, the second program in the given code reads a token (using in.next()) which would be the entire string \"YES\" or \"NO\" from the first program.\n\n But then the second program does:\n   s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\n So if the first program outputs \"YES\", then the second program gets the string \"YES\", and then replaces \"BC\" in it? There is no \"BC\" in \"YES\", so it becomes \"YES\".\n\n Then it counts the number of times an 'A' is followed (eventually) by a 'D'. In \"YES\", there is no 'A' and no 'D', so the count is 0.\n\n Similarly, for \"NO\", the count is 0.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain would output 0.\n\n However, this is a very trivial chain. But note: the problem does not say the programs are designed to work together. It just says we have two programs that are run in sequence.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n Steps for the entire chain:\n   Step 1: Read the initial input string (until newline) as in the first program.\n   Step 2: Process the string as in the first program to get a result string which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n   Step 3: Use that result string as the input to the second program.\n\n   However, the second program then does:\n        s = (the string from step 2).replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\")\n        then counts as described.\n\n   Then the final output is the count (a long) printed.\n\n But note: the first program outputs a string (with a newline) and the second program reads a token (without newline). \n   The second program uses in.next() which reads the next token (so it will read \"YES\" or \"NO\" without the newline).\n\n However, the first program outputs either:\n        \"YES\\n\" or \"NO\\n\"\n\n The Scanner's next() method by default reads tokens until whitespace, so it will read the word without the newline.\n\n But in our chain, we are not actually writing to the console and reading back. We are passing the string in memory.\n\n So we must mimic:\n\n   Step 1: read the entire line (including spaces) from stdin.\n\n   Step 2: process the line to get the last non-space, non-question mark character, convert to lowercase, and then decide if it is a vowel or 'y'. \n            Then set a string to either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n   Step 3: take that string (without any newline) and process it as the second program: \n            replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". But note: in the second program, the input is taken by in.next(), which does not include any newline.\n\n   Step 4: traverse the string from step 3 and compute the count.\n\n   Step 5: output the count (as a long integer, and then we must output a newline? The second program uses out.println).\n\n However, the second program outputs the count and then a newline.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input: a string (with spaces, and ending with a question mark? not necessarily) from stdin.\n\n   Output: a long integer (0 in both cases) followed by a newline.\n\n But wait: what if the first program's output is not \"YES\" or \"NO\"? Actually, it is always one of these.\n\n However, we must design the C program to do:\n\n   Read a line from stdin (we'll read until newline).\n\n   Process that line to compute the last non-space, non-question mark character, and then set a string to either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n   Then, take that string and replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". But note: the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and neither contains \"BC\", so we can skip the replacement? \n        However, we must do the replacement because the second program does it.\n\n   Then, traverse the string and count:\n        long cnt = 0, tmp = 0;\n        for each char in the string:\n            if char == 'A' -> tmp++\n            else if char == 'D' -> cnt += tmp\n            else -> tmp = 0\n\n   Then output cnt.\n\n However, note: the second program is designed to reset tmp on any character that is not 'A' or 'D'. In \"YES\" and \"NO\", we don't have 'A' or 'D'? \n\n   \"YES\": \n        Y -> else -> tmp=0\n        E -> else -> tmp=0\n        S -> else -> tmp=0 -> cnt remains 0.\n\n   \"NO\":\n        N -> else -> tmp=0\n        O -> else -> tmp=0 -> cnt=0.\n\n So the output is 0.\n\n But what if the first program's output were a string that contained 'A' and then a 'D'? For example, if the first program output \"AD\", then the second program would do:\n        replace \"BC\" in \"AD\" -> still \"AD\"\n        then: \n            first char 'A' -> tmp=1\n            second char 'D' -> cnt += 1 -> cnt=1\n        so output 1.\n\n However, the first program only outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\", so that won't happen.\n\n Therefore, the chain always outputs 0.\n\n But that seems odd. Let me double-check the first program:\n\n   It reads a line, then finds the last non-space and non-question mark character, then checks if that character (in lower case) is one of the vowels or 'y'. Then prints \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n   The second program then reads that string and processes it.\n\n   And we have established that for both \"YES\" and \"NO\", the second program outputs 0.\n\n So the entire chain for any input will output 0.\n\n However, let me test with an example:\n\n   Example 1: \"Hello?\" \n        The last non-space, non-? character is 'o'. Then output \"YES\".\n        Then the second program: \n            s = \"YES\" -> replace \"BC\" -> \"YES\"\n            traverse: \n                'Y' -> reset tmp to 0.\n                'E' -> reset tmp to 0.\n                'S' -> reset tmp to 0.\n            cnt=0 -> output 0.\n\n   Example 2: \"Hi?\" \n        last char is 'i' -> vowel -> \"YES\" -> then 0.\n\n   Example 3: \"Bye?\" \n        last char is 'e' -> vowel -> \"YES\" -> then 0.\n\n   Example 4: \"Why?\" \n        last char is 'y' -> considered vowel -> \"YES\" -> then 0.\n\n   Example 5: \"Try\" \n        no ? and no space at the end? The string is \"Try\". \n        The last non-space, non-? is 'y'. -> \"YES\" -> 0.\n\n   Example 6: \"What about this one\" \n        last non-space, non-? is 'e' -> \"YES\" -> 0.\n\n   Example 7: \"N\" \n        last char is 'N' -> to lower is 'n' -> not vowel -> \"NO\" -> 0.\n\n So indeed, the chain always outputs 0.\n\n However, this is the behavior. We must write a C program that does:\n\n   Read a line (we can use fgets to read a line).\n\n   Process the line to find the last non-space and non-question mark character.\n\n   Then set a string to either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without newline).\n\n   Then, replace every occurrence of \"BC\" in that string with \"D\". Since the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", we can skip replacement? But for correctness, we do.\n\n   Then, traverse the string and count as described.\n\n   Then output the count (which will be 0) as a long integer, and then a newline.\n\n But note: the second program in Java outputs the count and then a newline.\n\n However, we must note: the first program in Java does output a newline, but in our chain we are not outputting that intermediate string. We are using it as an in-memory string for the next step.\n\n Therefore, the C program:\n\n   Step 1: Read the entire line from stdin.\n\n   Step 2: \n        Traverse the line backwards to find the last non-space and non-question mark character.\n        Convert that character to lowercase (if it's an uppercase letter).\n\n        Check if that character is one of: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'. \n        Then set an intermediate string to either \"YES\" or \"NO\". We don't output it.\n\n   Step 3: \n        We have a string s1 = either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Now we need to replace every occurrence of \"BC\" in s1 with \"D\". \n        But note: \"YES\" and \"NO\" do not contain \"BC\", so we can skip. However, for generality, we can do:\n\n        We'll create a new string for the replaced version? But the string is small. We can do:\n\n        Actually, we can do the replacement on the fly while traversing? But let's do a simple replacement: we can use a loop to look for \"BC\", but the string is only 3 or 2 letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the string is short and we can do:\n\n        char *s2 = (we can use the same string since we are replacing two characters with one? but we cannot because the string is fixed). \n\n        Actually, the second program in Java replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", and then uses the new string. We can do:\n\n        We'll create a new string that is the result of replacement. But note: the original string is either \"YES\" (3 chars) or \"NO\" (2 chars). \n        Since there's no \"BC\", the new string is the same as the old.\n\n        So we can just use the original string.\n\n        But to be safe, we can do:\n\n        We'll create a buffer for the replaced string. The maximum length of the string we have is 3. The replacement of \"BC\" (2 chars) with \"D\" (1 char) would make the string shorter? but we don't have any \"BC\", so we can just use the original.\n\n        So we can avoid the replacement step? Actually, we must simulate exactly. Since the second program does the replacement, we must do it.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n          Let s1 = \"YES\" or \"NO\". We need to replace \"BC\" with \"D\". We can do:\n\n          We'll create a new string s2 and build it by traversing s1. Since we know the string is small, we can do:\n\n          char s2[10]; // enough\n          int j = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<strlen(s1); ) {\n            if (i+1 < strlen(s1) && s1[i]=='B' && s1[i+1]=='C') {\n                s2[j++] = 'D';\n                i += 2;\n            } else {\n                s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n            }\n          }\n          s2[j] = '\\0';\n\n        But note: the string s1 does not contain 'B' or 'C'? because it's either \"YES\" or \"NO\". So we can skip? But for correctness, we do the replacement.\n\n   Step 4: Now traverse s2 and compute:\n\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n        for (int i=0; s2[i]; i++) {\n            if (s2[i] == 'A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (s2[i] == 'D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n   Step 5: printf(\"%ld\\n\", cnt);\n\n But note: the second program outputs the count as a long integer and then a newline.\n\n However, we know the count will be 0.\n\n But what if we change the first program? The problem says the entire sequence. We must be generic.\n\n However, the problem gives two specific programs.\n\n But note: the second program is atcoder_AGC034_B. It is designed for a different input. But in the chain, the input to the second program is fixed to either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n Therefore, we can hardcode the replacement? But let's write the replacement for generality.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the replacement step is unnecessary because the string does not contain \"BC\". So we can avoid the replacement and use the original string for the counting.\n\n However, to be faithful, we'll do the replacement.\n\n But note: the first program outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\", and these are 3 and 2 characters. We can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the line.\n\n   Step 2: Process to get the character and set a string s1 to either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n   Step 3: Replace \"BC\" in s1: \n        We know s1 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so we can do:\n\n        if we see \"BC\" in s1? We don't, so we can set s2 = s1.\n\n        But we'll write the replacement code for correctness.\n\n   Step 4: Count.\n\n   Step 5: Print the count.\n\n However, we can optimize: we can avoid building a new string for the replacement if we do the counting while traversing the original string, but with a lookahead? \n        The second program does the replacement first and then the counting. We can do the same.\n\n        But note: the replacement might change the length and the positions of the characters. \n\n        We'll do the replacement first.\n\n But since the string is very short, we can do the replacement without performance concerns.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll read the input line.\n\n   Then, we find the last non-space and non-question mark character.\n\n   Then, we set s1 to:\n\n        if (vowel) then \"YES\"\n        else \"NO\"\n\n   Then, we create a new string s2 by replacing every occurrence of \"BC\" in s1 with \"D\". \n\n        Example: \n          s1 = \"ABCBC\" -> becomes \"ADBC\" then becomes \"ADD\"? \n          Actually, the replacement is global and non-overlapping? The Java replaceAll replaces all non-overlapping occurrences.\n\n        How to do: traverse s1 and when we see \"BC\", replace with 'D' and skip the next character.\n\n        Algorithm for replacement:\n\n          char s2[1000]; // but our s1 is at most 3, so 10 is enough.\n          int j = 0;\n          int i = 0;\n          while (i < strlen(s1)) {\n            if (s1[i] == 'B' && i+1 < strlen(s1) && s1[i+1] == 'C') {\n                s2[j++] = 'D';\n                i += 2;\n            } else {\n                s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n            }\n          }\n          s2[j] = '\\0';\n\n   Then, we do the counting on s2.\n\n   Finally, we output the count.\n\n However, we know that the replacement will not change the string because s1 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which do not contain \"BC\".\n\n But we do it for correctness.\n\n Let me write the C code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <ctype.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        char line[1000];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin); // read the entire line\n\n        // Step 1: find the last non-space and non-question mark\n        int len = strlen(line);\n        char last_char = 0;\n        // Traverse backwards\n        for (int i = len-1; i>=0; i--) {\n            if (line[i] != ' ' && line[i] != '?') {\n                last_char = line[i];\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Convert last_char to lowercase\n        last_char = tolower(last_char);\n\n        // Check if vowel or 'y'\n        char *s1;\n        if (last_char == 'a' || last_char == 'e' || last_char == 'i' || last_char == 'o' || last_char == 'u' || last_char == 'y') {\n            s1 = \"YES\"; // note: we cannot modify string literal, but we are going to copy for replacement? \n        } else {\n            s1 = \"NO\";\n        }\n\n        // Now, we do replacement: replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in s1.\n        char s2[10]; // enough for \"YES\" (3) or \"NO\" (2) and even if we had more, 10 is safe.\n        int j = 0;\n        int i = 0;\n        int len_s1 = strlen(s1);\n        while (i < len_s1) {\n            if (i+1 < len_s1 && s1[i]=='B' && s1[i+1]=='C') {\n                s2[j++] = 'D';\n                i += 2;\n            } else {\n                s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n            }\n        }\n        s2[j] = '\\0';\n\n        // Now, count as in the second program\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; s2[k]; k++) {\n            if (s2[k] == 'A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (s2[k] == 'D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Output the count\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", cnt);\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\n But note: the second program in Java outputs a long, and we use %ld for long in C.\n\n However, the problem says the second program outputs a long. In C, we use `long` but note that the Java long is 64-bit. In C, `long` might be 32-bit on some systems. \n        To be safe, we can use `long long` and %lld? \n\n        But the problem says: the second program uses `long cnt` and `long tmp` in Java.\n\n        In C, we can use `long` and `%ld` if we assume that `long` in C is at least 32 bits? But the problem does not specify the range. \n\n        However, the second program is designed for a string that is the output of the first, which is at most 3 characters. The count will be 0. So it doesn't matter.\n\n        But for correctness, we use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n However, note: the second program in Java uses `long` for `cnt` and `tmp`. In C, we can use `long` for the same.\n\n But to be safe for large counts? In our case the count is 0, but if the chain were different, we might need 64-bit. \n\n        The problem does not specify the maximum length of the input to the second program. However, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the count is 0.\n\n        So we can use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n But note: the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The second program uses 64-bit long in Java. In C, we can use `long long` to ensure 64-bit.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use `long` and hope it's 64-bit? \n\n        The problem does not specify the platform. But note that the second program is designed for a string that is the output of the first, which is very short. The count is 0.\n\n        So we can use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n However, to be safe and avoid overflow in a more general chain (if we were to use the same code for other inputs), we use `long long`? \n\n        But the problem says: translate the entire sequence. The second program uses `long` in Java, which is 64-bit. In C, we can use `long long` to get 64-bit, or `long` on 64-bit systems? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the value is 0, it doesn't matter. We'll use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n        But note: the problem says the second program outputs a long integer. We'll use `long` in C.\n\n        However, on Windows, `long` is 32-bit. On Linux, it can be 64-bit. To be safe, we use `long long` and `%lld`.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the platform. And the value is 0, which fits in 32 bits.\n\n        Let me stick with `long` and `%ld` for simplicity.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use `long long` to be safe for 64-bit values. But the value is 0.\n\n        I'll use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n However, the example in the second program uses `long` in Java and we are in C. Since the chain is fixed, we can use `long` and `%ld`.\n\n But note: the second program in Java prints the long without any formatting issue. In C, we must use the correct format.\n\n Let me write:\n\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n\n        ...\n\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", cnt);\n\n But wait, what if the system has 32-bit long? Then for a very long string (if we had a different input) it might overflow? But our input is fixed to \"YES\" or \"NO\", so we are safe.\n\n So the entire C program:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <ctype.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        char line[1000];\n        if (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) == NULL) {\n            // in case of error, we return\n            return 1;\n        }\n\n        int len = strlen(line);\n        // Remove the newline if present\n        if (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n            line[len-1] = '\\0';\n            len--;\n        }\n\n        // Traverse backwards to find the last non-space and non-'?' character\n        char last_char = 0;\n        for (int i = len-1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (line[i] != ' ' && line[i] != '?') {\n                last_char = line[i];\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If the line was empty, last_char might be 0 (null char). We set to 0 if not found.\n        last_char = tolower((unsigned char)last_char);\n\n        const char *s1;\n        if (last_char == 'a' || last_char == 'e' || last_char == 'i' || last_char == 'o' || last_char == 'u' || last_char == 'y') {\n            s1 = \"YES\";\n        } else {\n            s1 = \"NO\";\n        }\n\n        // Now, replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in s1 to form s2\n        char s2[10]; \n        int j = 0;\n        int i = 0;\n        int len_s1 = strlen(s1);\n        while (i < len_s1) {\n            if (i+1 < len_s1 && s1[i]=='B' && s1[i+1]=='C') {\n                s2[j++] = 'D';\n                i += 2;\n            } else {\n                s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n            }\n        }\n        s2[j] = '\\0';\n\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; s2[k] != '\\0'; k++) {\n            if (s2[k] == 'A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (s2[k] == 'D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", cnt);\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\n However, note: the first program in Java does not remove the newline? It uses sc.nextLine() which includes the newline? Actually, Scanner.nextLine() returns the line without the newline.\n\n   From the Java documentation: \n        \"Advances this scanner past the current line and returns the input that was skipped. This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line separator at the end.\"\n\n   So the string `s` in the first program does not have the trailing newline.\n\n   But our fgets includes the newline. So we remove it.\n\n   We do: \n        if (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n            line[len-1] = '\\0';\n            len--;\n        }\n\n   Then the rest.\n\n   Also, what if the line is empty? Then we traverse backwards and find nothing -> last_char remains 0. Then we set it to tolower(0) -> 0. Then the condition fails -> we set s1=\"NO\".\n\n   Then we process \"NO\" -> output 0.\n\n   This matches: the first program for an empty line would break at the for loop without setting ch? Actually, in the Java program, if the string is empty, the for loop doesn't set ch. \n        Then ch is 0. Then tolower(0) is 0. Then the condition fails -> \"NO\".\n\n   So it's consistent.\n\n   Let me test with an empty string:\n\n        Input: \"\" (then fgets reads the newline? Actually, if we type enter, then fgets reads a string with a newline and then we remove the newline? Then the string becomes empty.\n\n        Then we traverse: for i from -1? (if len=0) then the loop doesn't run -> last_char remains 0.\n\n        Then we set s1=\"NO\".\n\n        Then we process \"NO\" -> output 0.\n\n   But the first program: \n        String s = sc.nextLine() -> empty string.\n        length=0 -> the loop doesn't run -> ch=0 -> then condition fails -> \"NO\".\n\n   Then the second program: reads \"NO\", replaces -> \"NO\", then counts 0.\n\n   So output 0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   We output the C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: We assume the input line is at most 999 characters (to fit in the buffer of 1000). The problem does not specify, but we assume.\n\n   We also note that the tolast_char might be 0. We pass it to tolower. The tolower function: if the character is not representable as unsigned char, the behavior is undefined. \n        But 0 is representable. We cast to (unsigned char) to be safe.\n\n   We do: last_char = tolower((unsigned char)last_char);\n\n   However, if last_char is negative? The input from fgets is in the current locale. But we are reading as char. For simplicity, we assume the input is ASCII.\n\n   Since the problem is about vowels in English, we assume ASCII.\n\n   Therefore, the final code:"
