We'll write a helper function.\n\nHowever, the problem says: translate the entire sequence. We are allowed to write helper functions.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nImportant: The first program uses arrays of size D. We must allocate memory for p and c.\n\nWe assume D is not too large (as per the problem, D <= 10).\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  int D;\n  long long G;\n  scanf(\"%d %lld\", &D, &G);\n  int p[D], c[D];\n  for (int i=0; i<D; i++) {\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &p[i], &c[i]);\n  }\n\nThen compute the first_output.\n\nThen set y = first_output.\n\nThen run the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program might run for a long time? However, the cycle is 400 years? Actually, the leap year cycle is 400 years. But we are only adding one year at a time. Since the first_output is at most 100000 (from the first program's INF), then the next year with the same calendar might be within a few hundred years? So it's acceptable.\n\nLet's write the C code accordingly.\n\nWe must be cautious about the types and the logic.\n\nWe'll write:\n\n  // First program's logic\n\n  // Second program's logic\n\n  And then output the result of the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java does not have a class, so we just write the main logic.\n\nWe'll create a helper function for leap year.\n\nLet's code step by step.\n\nNote: The first program has a constant INF = 100000. We'll use that.\n\nAlso, the first program uses 100 * (i+1) * p[i] + c[i] for the score. Note: i is 0-indexed, so the point per problem is 100*(i+1).\n\nWe'll write the entire C program accordingly."
