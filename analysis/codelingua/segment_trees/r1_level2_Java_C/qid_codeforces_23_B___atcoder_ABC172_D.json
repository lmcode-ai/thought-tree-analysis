So we must read all the test cases. But we only need to compute the first output (x1) for the second program. So:\n\n  Step 1: Read `t`. Step 2: If `t>=1`, read the first `n1` and compute `x1 = (n1>2? n1-2 : 0)`. Step 3: For the remaining `t-1` test cases, read the integers (but we don't do anything with them). Step 4: Then run the second program with `n = x1`. But note: the second program runs for `n = x1`. It computes:\n\n      long ans = 0;\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n          long quotient = n / i;\n          ans += (long)i * quotient * (quotient+1) / 2;\n      }\n\nThen output `ans`. So the C program will output one integer: the result of the second program for `x1`. But what if `t` is 0? Then we don't have any test case. Then the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program would read from an empty input? That would be an error. But the first program would not output anything, so the second program would block on reading? In Java, `sc.nextInt()` would throw an exception if there's no input. In the C program, we must handle that. If `t==0`, then we don't have `x1`. So we must avoid running the second program? But the chain would have the second program trying to read and failing. But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the original chain would crash, we crash? Or we can define that when `t==0`, we do nothing? Looking at the first program: if `t==0`, it reads no numbers and outputs nothing. Then the second program is run and tries to read an integer from an empty stream. That would cause an exception in Java.",

But in C, `int` is typically 32-bit and can hold up to 2e9? But note: the problem does not specify the range of `n`. The first program reads `n` as an int. So it must be in the range of Java int: -2^31 to 2^31-1. But we are only considering n>=0? because if n<0, then `maxLeft` returns 0? Wait, the function `maxLeft`:\n\n      return n > 2 ? n - 2 : 0;\n\nSo if n is negative, it returns 0. Then the second program runs with n=0: the loop runs 0 times -> outputs 0. But the input `n` in the first program is from `scan.nextInt()`, which could be negative? So we must handle negative n1? In the first program: if n1 <= 2, we set x1=0. So if n1 is negative, x1=0. Then the second program: n=0, so the loop runs 0 times -> ans=0. So the above code handles it. But the type for the loop variable: we want to run from 1 to x1. If x1 is 0, we skip. If x1 is positive, then we run. But if x1 is negative? that should not happen because we set it to 0 for n1<=2. So x1 is nonnegative. So we can use:\n\n      for (long i = 1; i <= x1; i++) But if `x1` is very large (say 2e9), then `i` will go up to 2e9. The type `long` is safe on 64-bit systems, but on 32-bit systems, `long` is 32 bits? Actually, in C, `long` is 32 bits on Windows 64-bit?",

So it is safe. But we can also do:\n\n      long long tri = (long long) q;\n      tri = tri * (tri+1) / 2;\n\nThat is the same. Therefore, the final code is as above. Let me test with a small example. Input: \n      1\n      5\n\n  First program: t=1, then n1=5 -> x1 = 5-2 = 3.\n\n  Second program: n=3. i=1: q=3/1=3 -> tri=3*4/2=6 -> term=1*6=6 -> ans=6. i=2: q=3/2=1 -> tri=1*2/2=1 -> term=2*1=2 -> ans=8. i=3: q=3/3=1 -> tri=1 -> term=3*1=3 -> ans=11. Output: 11. But let me compute by hand: The second program in Java: \n          for i=1 to 3: \n             i=1: 1 * (3/1) * ( (3/1)+1 ) /2 = 1*3*4/2 = 1*3*2 = 6\n             i=2: 2 * (3/2) * ( (3/2)+1 ) /2 = 2*1*(1+1)/2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2*1*1 = 2\n             i=3: 3 * (3/3) * ( (3/3)+1 ) /2 = 3*1*(1+1)/2 = 3*1*2/2 = 3\n          total=6+2+3=11. So it matches. Another test: n1=0 -> x1=0. Then the second program: n=0, so loop runs 0 times -> ans=0. Input:\n      2\n      0\n      5\n\n  Then we take the first test case: n1=0 -> x1=0. Then we read the next 5 and discard. Then we run the second program with 0 -> output 0. But the first program would output two lines: \n       0\n       3\n\n  Then the second program would read the first integer 0 and output 0. So it matches. Therefore, the code is as below. Note: We must use `long long` for `ans` and `tri` to avoid overflow. Let me write the code accordingly.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs. The first one (codeforces_23_B) reads an integer `t`, then for each test case reads an integer `n` and outputs `maxLeft(n)` which is `n-2` if `n>2` else `0`.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC172_D) reads an integer `n` and computes:\n    ans = 0\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        ans += i * (n // i) * ( (n // i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nHowever, note that the instructions say that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. This implies that the output of the first program (which is multiple lines: `t` lines of integers) will be the input to the second program.\n\nBut wait: the second program only reads one integer. How does that work?\n\nLooking at the original chain:\n  The first program reads `t` and then `t` numbers and prints `t` numbers (each being the result of `maxLeft(n)` for each test case).\n  The second program expects one integer and then does a computation.\n\nThis chain would break because the second program expects one integer but the first program outputs multiple.\n\nHowever, note the problem statement: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (which is `t` integers, one per line) becomes the input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program only reads one integer. That means the rest of the input would be ignored? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not as straightforward. We must consider the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\".\n\nActually, the problem says: we are given a set of Java programs that are executed in sequence, with the output of one being the input to the next.\n\nBut the first program outputs multiple integers and the second program expects one. This is a problem.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem statement: it says \"the entire sequence\". The two programs are independent? But then the chain would be:\n\n  Input -> Program1 -> Output1 -> Program2 -> Output2\n\nBut Program2 only reads one integer, so it would only read the first integer from Output1 and ignore the rest? Then the behavior of the chain would be:\n\n  For the first test case of Program1, we get an output, say `x1`. Then Program2 would run with input `x1` and produce an output. Then what? The next test cases from Program1 are still in the buffer? But Program2 doesn't read them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire output of Program1 is taken as input to Program2, but Program2 only uses the first integer. Then the rest of the integers are lost.\n\nBut that does not seem to be the intended meaning. Another possibility: the chain is run for each test case independently? But note the first program has a loop for `t` test cases.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the two programs are not meant to be chained together? But the instruction says they are executed in sequence.\n\nAfter careful thought, I notice that the two programs are entirely separate and independent. The first one solves one problem, the second another. They are not logically chained.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must chain them as is.\n\nTherefore, the entire output of the first program (which is `t` integers, each on a new line) is the input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program only reads one integer. So when we run the second program, it will read the first integer from the output of the first program and ignore the rest. Then the second program produces one output.\n\nSo the entire chain would output only one number? That doesn't seem to match the first program's multiple outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is intended to run the second program for each of the outputs of the first program? But the problem doesn't say that.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let me look again at the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nWhat is the same behavior?\n\nThe original chain behavior is:\n\n  Step 1: Read `t` and then `t` numbers. For each number `n`, output `maxLeft(n)` (which is `max(0, n-2)`).\n\n  Step 2: The entire output of step1 is fed as input to step2. Step2 reads the first integer from that input (which is the result for the first test case) and then computes the sum for that integer? and outputs one number.\n\nBut then the chain only produces one output for the entire set of test cases? That doesn't seem to match the structure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program runs for each of the outputs of the first program? That is, for each test case, we run the second program on the result of the first program.\n\nBut note the problem says: the entire output of the first program is the input to the next.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I will stick to the literal interpretation: the entire output of the first program is the input to the second program.\n\nTherefore, the C program should:\n\n  1. Read the integer `t`.\n  2. Read `t` integers (the test cases).\n  3. For each test case, compute `x_i = maxLeft(n_i)`.\n  4. Then, take the entire collection of these `x_i` and pass them as input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program only reads one integer. So the second program will only use the first `x_i` and ignore the rest.\n\nSo the chain would output the result of the second program for the first test case? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the two programs are not chained in the way we think? Or perhaps the example is flawed.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". So we have to do exactly that.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nThe behavior of the entire sequence is:\n\n  Input: \n      t\n      n1\n      n2\n      ...\n      nt\n\n  Output of first program: \n      x1\n      x2\n      ...\n      xt   (where xi = maxLeft(ni))\n\n  Then the second program is run with input that is the entire output of the first program. The second program reads the first integer of that input (which is x1) and then computes:\n\n      ans = 0\n      for i from 1 to x1:\n          ans += i * (x1 // i) * ( (x1 // i) + 1 ) / 2\n\n  And then outputs `ans`.\n\nSo the entire chain outputs one integer.\n\nTherefore, the C program should:\n\n  - Read `t` and the `t` numbers.\n  - Compute the first test case result: `x1 = maxLeft(n1)`\n  - Then, the second program runs on `x1` (ignoring the rest of the test cases?).\n\nBut wait, what about the rest of the test cases? The first program outputs `t` numbers, but the second program only uses the first. So the rest of the numbers (x2, x3, ..., xt) are ignored.\n\nThis is the behavior we must replicate.\n\nAlternatively, if the chain is intended to run the second program for each of the outputs, then we would have `t` outputs. But the problem does not say that. It says the entire sequence of two programs.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program should:\n\n  1. Read the first integer `t` (number of test cases).\n  2. Read the first test case `n1` (and then the next `t-1` integers, but we won't use them for the second program? but note: the first program must process all to produce output for each, but the second program only uses the first output).\n\nHowever, the first program produces `t` outputs. The second program then reads the first of these and ignores the rest. So in the chain, the rest of the outputs (from the second test case onward) are read by the second program but not used? That would leave the input stream of the second program with extra data.\n\nBut in the second program, after reading one integer, the program does not read any more. So the rest of the data is effectively ignored.\n\nSo in the C program, we can:\n\n  - Read `t`.\n  - Read the first test case `n1` and compute `x1 = maxLeft(n1)`. \n  - Also, we must read the remaining `t-1` test cases (to simulate the first program reading them) but we don't need to compute anything for them? \n\nBut note: the first program outputs `t` numbers. However, the second program only uses the first. So we can skip computing the rest? \n\nBut wait: the problem says the entire sequence must be replicated. The first program does compute and output for every test case. However, the second program only uses the first. \n\nBut in the single C program, we don't need to compute the other outputs if they are going to be ignored? \n\nHowever, we must replicate the behavior exactly. The first program does read all the input and then outputs `t` numbers. The second program then reads the first number and ignores the rest. \n\nBut if we skip reading the rest of the test cases, that would be incorrect because the first program does read them.\n\nSo we must:\n\n  - Read `t`\n  - For the first test case, read `n1` and compute `x1 = maxLeft(n1)`\n  - For the next `t-1` test cases, read the numbers (we don't need to compute anything for them? because we are not going to use them for the second program? but the first program would have outputted something for each, but the second program only uses the first).\n\nBut note: the second program gets the entire output of the first program as input. The entire output includes the first number and then the rest. So the second program's input is:\n\n   x1\n   x2\n   ...\n   xt\n\nBut the second program only reads the first integer (x1) and ignores the rest. So we don't need to compute x2, x3, ...? \n\nHowever, the first program does compute them. But the problem does not require that we output them at the end. The chain output is the output of the second program (one integer). \n\nBut to be faithful, we must compute x2, x3, ...? because the first program does? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is:\n\n   Input: \n        t\n        n1\n        n2\n        ... \n        nt\n\n   The first program outputs:\n        x1\n        x2\n        ...\n        xt\n\n   Then the second program is run with that entire output as its input. The second program reads the first integer (x1) and computes a result for x1, and outputs that.\n\n   The rest of the numbers (x2...xt) are never used by the second program.\n\nSo in the C program, we can avoid computing x2...xt? \n\nBut wait: what if the second program did more reads? It doesn't. So the rest of the numbers are not read. Therefore, we don't need to compute them. \n\nHowever, the first program does read all the numbers. So we must read all the test cases. But we only need to compute the first output (x1) for the second program. \n\nSo:\n\n  Step 1: Read `t`.\n  Step 2: If `t>=1`, read the first `n1` and compute `x1 = (n1>2? n1-2 : 0)`.\n  Step 3: For the remaining `t-1` test cases, read the integers (but we don't do anything with them).\n  Step 4: Then run the second program with `n = x1`.\n\nBut note: the second program runs for `n = x1`. It computes:\n\n      long ans = 0;\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n          long quotient = n / i;\n          ans += (long)i * quotient * (quotient+1) / 2;\n      }\n\nThen output `ans`.\n\nSo the C program will output one integer: the result of the second program for `x1`.\n\nBut what if `t` is 0? Then we don't have any test case. Then the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program would read from an empty input? That would be an error. But the first program would not output anything, so the second program would block on reading? In Java, `sc.nextInt()` would throw an exception if there's no input.\n\nIn the C program, we must handle that. If `t==0`, then we don't have `x1`. So we must avoid running the second program? But the chain would have the second program trying to read and failing.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the original chain would crash, we crash? Or we can define that when `t==0`, we do nothing? \n\nLooking at the first program: if `t==0`, it reads no numbers and outputs nothing. Then the second program is run and tries to read an integer from an empty stream. That would cause an exception in Java.\n\nIn C, we can simulate that by reading an integer when there is none? That would lead to an error. But we are to write a robust program? The problem does not specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we are allowed to read all the input at the beginning.\n\nWe must design:\n\n  - If `t==0`, then we don't have any number for the second program. Then we should not call the second program? But the chain would have run the second program and it would have failed. \n\nBut in our C program, we must mimic the behavior. Since the second program would fail, we must also fail? But we are writing one program. We can do:\n\n  if (t == 0) {\n      // The second program would try to read and fail. We can try to read an integer and if it fails, we might output nothing? but the problem says only the last block produces output.\n      // However, the second program is the last block and it would output nothing (because it crashes). So we output nothing? and return an error?\n  }\n\nBut the problem does not specify error handling. We'll assume that the input is valid and that the chain will always have at least one test case? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the first program does not require that t>=1. It reads t and then for i from 0 to t-1. So if t==0, it does nothing and outputs nothing. Then the second program runs and tries to read an integer and fails.\n\nIn C, if we try to read an integer when there is none, `scanf` will return 0. Then we must not run the second program? But the chain would have run the second program and it would have crashed. We are to mimic the behavior. \n\nBut the problem does not specify error conditions. Let us assume the input is always valid and that there is at least one test case? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  If `t==0`, then the second program will attempt to read and fail. So we can simulate that by reading an integer and if we fail, we output nothing? and exit? \n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. We must be faithful.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that `t` is at least 1. The problem does not specify, but the example programs do not handle t=0. \n\nBut the first program does: it reads t and then loops t times. So if t=0, it reads no numbers and outputs nothing. Then the second program runs and tries to read an integer from an empty input. In C, we can check the return value of `scanf`.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  1. Read `t`.\n  2. If `t` is 0, then we have no test cases. Then we skip reading any further for the first program. But the second program must run and try to read. So we try to read an integer (which will fail). Then we do nothing? But the second program would crash. In C, we can do:\n\n        int t;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n        int n1;\n        int x1;\n        if (t > 0) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n            x1 = (n1 > 2) ? n1 - 2 : 0;\n            // Then read the remaining t-1 numbers and do nothing with them.\n            for (int i = 1; i < t; i++) {\n                int temp;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n            }\n        } else {\n            // t==0, so we have no numbers to read for the first program.\n            // Then the second program will try to read one integer. We simulate that by trying to read one integer, which fails.\n            // But note: the input might be exhausted. We don't have any more input.\n            // So we set x1 to some value? but we don't have it. We must not run the second program? \n            // However, the chain runs the second program regardless. So we must run the second program? but what is n?\n            // The second program would crash because there is no input. So in C, we try to read an integer and if we fail, we return without output.\n            // How about: we try to read an integer and if we can't, we output nothing and exit?\n        }\n\n  3. Then, if we were able to get x1 (i.e., t>0), then we run the second program with n = x1.\n\nBut what if t==0? Then we try to read one integer for the second program:\n\n        int n_second;\n        if (scanf(\"%d\", &n_second) != 1) {\n            // If we fail to read, then we output nothing? and exit.\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n  But wait, that is not what happens in the chain: the second program is run with an empty input. The first program output nothing, so the second program's input is empty. Then the second program's `sc.nextInt()` would throw a `java.util.NoSuchElementException`. We don't output anything.\n\n  However, in the chain, the second program is run and it crashes. Our C program should not output anything.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"reproduces the same behavior\". If the chain crashes, we should crash? Or output nothing? The problem does not specify. We'll output nothing.\n\n  However, in the chain, the second program is the last block and it produces no output because it crashes. So we produce no output.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So if the last block doesn't produce output, we don't.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if (t > 0) {\n          // then we have x1, and we run the second program and output the result.\n      } else {\n          // t==0: then we try to read the integer for the second program. If we can't (which we expect), we output nothing.\n          int dummy;\n          if (scanf(\"%d\", &dummy) == 1) {\n              // This should not happen? but if there is an extra input, then we run the second program on that.\n              // But the chain would have the second program run on the output of the first, which is empty. So we should not get here.\n              // However, to be safe, if we do read an integer, then we run the second program on that integer.\n              // But that would be against the chain? because the chain has no output from the first program, so the second program would not get this integer.\n              // Actually, the chain would have the second program reading from the pipe that is empty. So if the input for the entire chain had more numbers, they would be available to the second program? \n              // But the first program didn't output anything, so the second program gets an empty stream. So the extra numbers are after the first program's input? and not part of the first program's output.\n              // Therefore, the second program should not see them.\n\n          }\n          // else, we just exit without output.\n      }\n\n  But note: the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. The first program reads `t` and then `t` numbers. Then the second program reads from the output of the first. So if `t==0`, the first program reads `0` and then stops. Then the second program tries to read from the output of the first (which is empty). It does not get the rest of the input that was after the `0`? \n\n  Actually, the chain is:\n\n        $ echo \"0\" | java FirstProgram | java SecondProgram\n\n  The first program outputs nothing. The second program tries to read from an empty pipe. So it doesn't see the rest of the input (if any) because the first program didn't output it? \n\n  But note: the input to the chain is \"0\". The first program reads the 0 and then stops. There is no more input for the first program. The second program then reads from the pipe that connects the first program's output (which is empty). So the second program does not see any more data.\n\n  Therefore, in our C program, when t==0, we should not try to read any more data? because the first program only read the 0 and then the input is exhausted? \n\n  But wait: the input to the chain might have been:\n\n        0\n        5   <-- this is extra? but the first program doesn't read it because t=0.\n\n  Then the second program does not see the 5? because the first program didn't output it. So in our C program, we should not read the 5? \n\n  Therefore, after reading t=0, we do not read any more integers for the first program. Then the second program's input is empty. So we try to read an integer and fail? but that 5 is still in the input? \n\n  Actually, in the chain, the second program is connected to the first program's output, not to the original input. So the second program does not see the 5. The 5 is left unread.\n\n  But in our C program, we are reading from the same input stream. So we have:\n\n        Input stream: [0, 5]\n\n        We read t=0.\n        Then we try to read for the second program: we read 5? \n\n  That would be incorrect because in the chain, the second program does not see 5.\n\n  How can we simulate? We cannot. Because in the chain, the first program only read the 0 and then the 5 remains in the input stream of the first program, but the second program is connected to the output of the first (which is empty). So the 5 is never passed to the second program.\n\n  Therefore, in our C program, we must not read the 5? \n\n  But we are reading from stdin. We have already read the 0. The 5 is still in the buffer. How do we avoid reading it for the second program? We don't. \n\n  This indicates a flaw in the problem: the chain of programs in Java would have the second program not having access to the original input beyond what the first program read. But in the C program, we are reading from the same stdin. So we have to simulate the fact that the second program only sees the output of the first program.\n\n  How can we do that? We cannot rewind stdin.\n\n  Therefore, we must store the entire output of the first program in memory and then use that as the input to the second program. But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. So we are allowed to store in memory.\n\n  Revised plan:\n\n  Step 1: Read `t`.\n  Step 2: Read the `t` integers (n1, n2, ..., nt). Store them? Actually, we only need the first one for the second program, but the first program outputs all. However, the second program only uses the first output.\n\n  But to be faithful, we must produce the entire output of the first program and then feed the first line to the second program? \n\n  However, the problem says: intermediate steps without I/O. So we can simulate the output of the first program in memory: we compute an array of `x_i` for i=0 to t-1. Then the input to the second program is the array? but we only use the first element.\n\n  So:\n\n      Read t.\n      Allocate an array of t integers.\n      For i=0 to t-1:\n          read n_i\n          compute x_i = (n_i>2)? n_i-2 : 0;\n\n      Then, the second program will take the entire array as its input? but the second program only reads one integer. So we set `n_second = x_0`.\n\n      Then compute the answer for the second program with n = x_0.\n\n      Then output that answer.\n\n  But note: the second program does not read the rest of the x_i. So we don't need to store the entire array? We only need the first x_i.\n\n  However, we must read the entire input of the first program (which is t and then t numbers). So we can:\n\n      Read t.\n      If t>0, read the first n and compute x0 = maxLeft(n).\n      Then, for i=1 to t-1, read the next n_i (we don't compute anything for them, but we must read them to advance the input).\n\n      Then, the second program runs on x0.\n\n  And we output the result of the second program.\n\n  But what if t==0? Then we don't have any x0. Then the second program fails to read. So we output nothing.\n\n  However, the input for the first program is only the 0? and then we stop. Then the second program fails to read. So we don't output anything.\n\n  So the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n          long x1 = 0; // We'll use this for the second program's input.\n          int hasX1 = 0; // flag to indicate if we have x1\n\n          if (t > 0) {\n              int n1;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n              // compute maxLeft for n1\n              if (n1 > 2) {\n                  x1 = n1 - 2;\n              } else {\n                  x1 = 0;\n              }\n              hasX1 = 1;\n\n              // Read the remaining t-1 integers and discard.\n              for (int i = 1; i < t; i++) {\n                  int temp;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now, if we have at least one test case (hasX1==1), then the second program uses x1.\n          // Otherwise, we try to read an integer for the second program? but note: the second program gets the output of the first, which is empty if t==0.\n          // So if t==0, we must simulate the second program reading from an empty stream.\n\n          if (hasX1) {\n              // Now run the second program with n = x1.\n              long long ans = 0; // use long long to avoid overflow, because the second program uses long (which is 64-bit in Java) and the numbers can be big.\n              // Note: x1 is nonnegative and at most ... the input n1 was arbitrary, but we did n1-2, so it could be large? \n              for (int i = 1; i <= x1; i++) {\n                  long quotient = x1 / i; // integer division\n                  // term = i * quotient * (quotient+1) / 2\n                  // But note: we must do the multiplication and division carefully to avoid overflow? \n                  // Since quotient = x1 / i, and x1 can be up to maybe 10^9? then quotient can be up to 10^9, and i up to 10^9.\n                  // So i * quotient might be 10^18, which fits in long long (if long long is 64-bit, which it usually is).\n\n                  // We break the expression: \n                  //   term = i * quotient * (quotient+1) / 2\n                  // We can compute: \n                  //   part = (quotient * (quotient+1)) / 2   [this is a triangular number]\n                  //   then term = i * part\n\n                  long long triangular = (long long) quotient * (quotient+1) / 2;\n                  ans += (long long) i * triangular;\n              }\n              printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n          } else {\n              // t==0: then the second program would try to read an integer and fail. So we don't output anything.\n              // But we must try to read? to simulate? Actually, the second program fails because there is no input. \n              // In our C program, we have already read the entire input that the first program read (which was just t=0). \n              // There is no more input for the second program? because the first program didn't output anything. \n              // So we don't do anything.\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nBut wait: what if the input has more data after the t=0 and the first program's input? The first program only read the 0 and then stopped. The second program then runs and tries to read from the output of the first (which is empty). It doesn't matter if there was more data in the original input? because the second program doesn't see it.\n\nBut in our C program, the entire input is in one stream. We have already read the 0 (for t). Then we do not read any more for the first program (because t=0). Then we don't run the second program. But the second program in the chain would have tried to read and failed. In our C program, we are not even trying to read for the second program? \n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. The second program is part of the sequence. We must simulate the second program trying to read and failing? \n\nIn the above code, when t==0, we skip the entire second program computation and output. But we did not simulate the second program's attempt to read.\n\nHow to simulate? We can try to read one integer? but that would read from the same stdin. And if there is more data, we would read it? which is not what the chain does.\n\nThis is a flaw in the design: in the chain, the second program does not have access to the original input beyond what the first program read. But in the C program, we are reading from the same stdin.\n\nTherefore, we must not read beyond what the first program read. The first program read `t` and then `t` numbers. So after reading `t=0`, we have read one integer. The rest of the input is still in the buffer? but the second program should not see it.\n\nBut the problem does not specify how to handle this. We'll assume that the input is exactly as the first program expects. The second program only sees the output of the first program. So in the C program, we must not read the extra data for the second program? \n\nBut how? We cannot unread the data.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be intended to be run with the entire input available, and the first program reads exactly its input. Then the second program reads from the output of the first program, which we have computed internally.\n\nSo we change our approach: we store the entire output of the first program in an array. Then the second program will read from that array? But the second program only reads one integer. So we can take the first integer in that array.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs `t` integers. We can compute all of them? But we only need the first.\n\nBut to be consistent with the chain, we must have the entire output of the first program available. Then the second program reads the first integer of that output and ignores the rest.\n\nSo we can:\n\n      Step 1: Read t.\n      Step 2: Allocate an array of t integers (if t>0) and compute the outputs for each test case.\n      Step 3: Then the second program will take as input the entire array? but we only need the first element.\n\n      Then we run the second program on the first element.\n\n      But we don't need the entire array? only the first element.\n\n      So why store the entire array? We can avoid it by only storing the first output.\n\n      However, we must read all the test cases to advance the input.\n\n      Therefore, we read all test cases and compute the first output and store it. For the rest, we read and compute but then discard? or just read and discard? \n\n      We can:\n\n          if (t>0) {\n              int n1;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n              x1 = ...;\n              // then for the rest, we read and compute the output? but we don't need it. So we just read and discard.\n              for (int i=1; i<t; i++) {\n                  int temp;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n                  // We could compute maxLeft(temp) but then throw away? but the problem doesn't require it.\n              }\n          }\n\n      But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior is that the first program outputs `t` numbers. The second program then reads the first. So we don't need the others.\n\n      However, the first program does compute them. But if we skip the computation, it doesn't affect the output of the chain. So we can skip.\n\n      Therefore, we only compute x1.\n\n  So the code I wrote above is acceptable.\n\n  But there is one more issue: the type of x1. In the first program, `maxLeft` returns an `int`. Then the second program reads an `int` and uses it as `n`. But note: the second program uses `long` for `n`? Actually, it casts `n` to long. But `n` is an integer. So we can use `x1` as an integer. Then in the second program, we use `x1` as `int` but then convert to `long` for the computation? \n\n  However, in the C program, we are storing `x1` in a `long`? Actually, in the code above, I declared `x1` as `long`? But then in the for-loop we use `i<=x1` and `x1` is `long`. That is okay.\n\n  But note: the second program in Java uses `long` for `i`, `n`, and `ans`. But in the for-loop, `i` is `int` and then cast to `long` in the expression. However, if `x1` is large (like 10^9), then the for-loop from 1 to x1 is O(n) and might be slow. But the original Java program does that.\n\n  We have to do the same.\n\n  But the problem does not specify performance. We assume the input sizes are such that it runs in time.\n\n  Therefore, the final C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n          long x1 = 0; // We'll store the first output here. If there is no test case, we leave it 0 (but then we don't use it).\n          int hasX1 = 0;\n\n          if (t > 0) {\n              int n1;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n              if (n1 > 2) {\n                  x1 = n1 - 2;\n              } else {\n                  x1 = 0;\n              }\n              hasX1 = 1;\n\n              // Read the rest of the test cases and discard.\n              for (int i = 1; i < t; i++) {\n                  int temp;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n                  // We don't do anything with temp.\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (hasX1) {\n              // Now run the second program with n = x1.\n              long long ans = 0;\n              // We use a loop from 1 to x1 (inclusive)\n              // Note: if x1 is 0, the loop runs 0 times -> ans=0.\n              for (long i = 1; i <= x1; i++) {\n                  long q = x1 / i; // integer division\n                  // Compute triangular number for q: T(q) = q*(q+1)/2\n                  long long tri = (long long)q * (q+1) / 2;\n                  ans += (long long)i * tri;\n              }\n              printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n          }\n          // else, if no test case, we output nothing.\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `i` as an int. But if `x1` is large (over 2e9) then `i` as a long is the same as in Java? In Java, the loop variable `i` is an int, so it can only go up to about 2e9? but if `x1` is bigger than 2e9? \n\nHowever, the first program: `maxLeft` returns an int. And the input `n1` is an int. So `x1` is at most about 2e9? So `i` as a long is safe? but the loop variable `i` in the second program in Java is an int. So if `x1` is more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (about 2e9) then the Java program would have an integer overflow in the loop? \n\nBut the input `n1` is an int, so `x1` = max(0, n1-2) is at most about 2e9? Then the loop in Java would run from 1 to x1, but x1 is at most about 2e9, which is near the limit of int. But note: `i` in the loop is an int, so when i reaches `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, then the next increment would become negative and the loop would break? \n\nActually, the condition `i < n + 1` would be `i < 2000000001` (if n=2000000000). But `i` can go up to 2000000000, then next would be 2000000001, which is greater than 2000000000? then the loop stops. So it is safe? \n\nBut what if `x1` is 0? then the loop runs 0 times.\n\nIn C, we use `long i` for the loop? but `long` in C might be 32-bit on some systems? We need to ensure that `x1` can be up to about 2e9? so we need a 64-bit integer? Actually, we don't: 2e9 is within the range of 32-bit signed int (which goes up to about 2e9). But to be safe for 64-bit, we use `long` for `i`? but note that `x1` is at most about 2e9, so `i` will be at most 2e9, which fits in a 32-bit int? \n\nBut in C, the type of `i` in the loop: we declared `long i` to match the potential size? but actually, `x1` is stored in a `long` (which we hope is at least 32 bits). \n\nAlternatively, we can use `int i` for the loop? because `x1` is at most about 2e9, which is the limit of int? But in C, `int` is typically 32-bit and can hold up to 2e9? \n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the range of `n`. The first program reads `n` as an int. So it must be in the range of Java int: -2^31 to 2^31-1. But we are only considering n>=0? because if n<0, then `maxLeft` returns 0? \n\nWait, the function `maxLeft`:\n\n      return n > 2 ? n - 2 : 0;\n\nSo if n is negative, it returns 0. Then the second program runs with n=0: the loop runs 0 times -> outputs 0.\n\nBut the input `n` in the first program is from `scan.nextInt()`, which could be negative? \n\nSo we must handle negative n1? \n\nIn the first program: if n1 <= 2, we set x1=0. So if n1 is negative, x1=0.\n\nThen the second program: n=0, so the loop runs 0 times -> ans=0.\n\nSo the above code handles it.\n\nBut the type for the loop variable: we want to run from 1 to x1. If x1 is 0, we skip. If x1 is positive, then we run. But if x1 is negative? that should not happen because we set it to 0 for n1<=2. So x1 is nonnegative.\n\nSo we can use:\n\n      for (long i = 1; i <= x1; i++) \n\nBut if `x1` is very large (say 2e9), then `i` will go up to 2e9. The type `long` is safe on 64-bit systems, but on 32-bit systems, `long` is 32 bits? Actually, in C, `long` is 32 bits on Windows 64-bit? No, on Windows 64-bit, `long` is 32 bits? But then 2e9 is the limit of 32-bit signed. So we can use `long long i`? or we can use `long` if we are sure it is 32 bits? \n\nAlternatively, we can use `int` for the loop variable? because `x1` is at most about 2e9, and `int` in C is at least 16 bits? but typically 32 bits and can hold 2e9? \n\nBut note: the standard says `int` must hold at least -32767 to 32767. So 2e9 might not fit? \n\nSo we should use `long` for the loop variable? But `long` is guaranteed at least 32 bits? and 2e9 fits in 31 bits? \n\nBut to be safe, since `x1` is `long`, we should use `long` for the loop variable. \n\nBut on the other hand, the second program in Java uses `int i` and it works for `x1` up to about 2e9? because that is the limit of Java int. So we can use `int` for the loop variable? but then if `x1` is 2000000000, then `i` will be 2000000000 which fits in a 32-bit int? \n\nBut if `x1` is 2000000000, then the last iteration will be `i=2000000000`, which is within the range of int (which is up to 2147483647). So we can use `int` for the loop variable? \n\nBut note: in C, `int` might be 16 bits? We are not told the platform. But typically in online judges, `int` is 32 bits. \n\nAlternatively, we can use `long i` to be safe. But if we are compiling in an environment where `long` is 64 bits, then the loop might be slower? But the original Java program used int and was O(n), so we are in the same complexity.\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify the constraints on `n1` beyond being an int, and that the worst-case `x1` is about 2e9, we can use `int` for the loop variable? \n\nBut let me check: 2e9 is 2000000000, which is less than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So it is safe.\n\nSo we can change:\n\n      for (int i = 1; i <= x1; i++) \n\nBut wait: `x1` is `long`. Comparing `int i` to `long x1`? that is okay. But if `x1` is more than `INT_MAX`? but we established that `x1` is at most about 2e9, which is less than `INT_MAX` (if `INT_MAX` is 2147483647). So it is safe? \n\nBut what if `x1` is 2147483647? then the loop runs until `i=2147483647`, which is the maximum value for an int. Then when we do `i++` we get overflow? \n\nIn C, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. So we must avoid.\n\nTherefore, we should use a long for the loop variable? or an unsigned int? but the problem says nonnegative.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a long long for the loop variable? to avoid overflow? but that would be inefficient.\n\nBut note: the maximum value of `x1` is 2000000000 (if the input n1 is 2000000002) but 2000000000 is less than INT_MAX? (2147483647). So we can use `int` for the loop variable? \n\nBut what if the input n1 is 2147483647+2? But the first program reads n1 as an int. In Java, an int is 32 bits, so the maximum value is 2147483647. So n1 cannot be more than that. So x1 = n1-2 is at most 2147483647-2 = 2147483645, which is less than INT_MAX? \n\nBut wait: in C, `int` might be 16 bits? But the problem does not specify. We must be cautious.\n\nGiven that the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", and the original Java program uses int, we can use `int` for the loop variable? but then if `x1` is 2000000000, we are safe on a system with 32-bit int? \n\nTo be safe, let us use `long` for the loop variable? because `long` is at least 32 bits and can hold 2e9. \n\nBut note: in C, `long` may be 32 bits. But 2e9 is about 2^31, and `long` is signed so it can go to 2^31-1. So 2000000000 is 2e9 < 2^31-1? 2^31-1 is about 2.147e9, so 2e9 is less.\n\nTherefore, we can use `long` for the loop variable? but we already have `x1` as `long`. \n\nBut we can change the loop to:\n\n      for (long i = 1; i <= x1; i++) \n\nBut if `x1` is 0, we skip. If `x1` is 2000000000, then we do 2e9 iterations, which might be slow? but the original Java program does the same.\n\nSo we do:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n          long x1 = 0;\n          int hasX1 = 0;\n\n          if (t > 0) {\n              int n1;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n              if (n1 > 2) {\n                  x1 = (long)n1 - 2;\n              } else {\n                  x1 = 0;\n              }\n              hasX1 = 1;\n\n              for (int i = 1; i < t; i++) {\n                  int temp;\n                  scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (hasX1) {\n              unsigned long long ans = 0; // use unsigned to avoid overflow? but the original used long (signed) in Java.\n              // But the values are nonnegative. We can use unsigned for more range? but the problem doesn't require.\n              // We'll use unsigned long long for ans? but let's use long long.\n\n              // The maximum value of the term: i * quotient * (quotient+1) / 2\n              // When i and quotient are large, the product might be huge. The original used long (64 bits) in Java.\n              // We use long long (which is 64 bits) for ans and intermediate terms.\n\n              for (long i = 1; i <= x1; i++) {\n                  long q = x1 / i; // integer division\n                  // Compute triangular number: q*(q+1)/2\n                  // q is long, so q*(q+1) might be near 10^18? \n                  // Example: if q is 10^9, then q*(q+1) is 10^18, which is the limit of long long (which is about 9e18 for signed) -> so 10^18 is too big for signed long long? \n                  // Actually: 10^18 is 1e18, and the maximum for signed long long is about 9.2e18. So 1e18 is safe? \n                  // But 10^9 * (10^9+1) = 10^18 + 10^9, which is about 1e18+1e9, which is less than 9e18? \n                  // So it is safe.\n\n                  // But we do: (q * (q+1)) / 2. If q is even, no problem. If odd, then we lose one? but it's integer division so it should be exact? \n                  // Actually, q*(q+1) is always even.\n\n                  long long tri = (long long)q * (q+1) / 2;\n                  ans += (long long)i * tri;\n              }\n              printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nBut note: the expression `(long long)q * (q+1) / 2` might overflow the multiplication if q is very large? \n\nFor example, if q is 2e9, then (2e9 * (2e9+1)) is about 4e18, which is within the range of `long long` (which is about 9e18). So it is safe.\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n      long long tri = (long long) q;\n      tri = tri * (tri+1) / 2;\n\nThat is the same.\n\nTherefore, the final code is as above.\n\nLet me test with a small example.\n\n  Input: \n      1\n      5\n\n  First program: t=1, then n1=5 -> x1 = 5-2 = 3.\n\n  Second program: n=3.\n      i=1: q=3/1=3 -> tri=3*4/2=6 -> term=1*6=6 -> ans=6.\n      i=2: q=3/2=1 -> tri=1*2/2=1 -> term=2*1=2 -> ans=8.\n      i=3: q=3/3=1 -> tri=1 -> term=3*1=3 -> ans=11.\n\n  Output: 11.\n\n  But let me compute by hand: \n      The second program in Java: \n          for i=1 to 3: \n             i=1: 1 * (3/1) * ( (3/1)+1 ) /2 = 1*3*4/2 = 1*3*2 = 6\n             i=2: 2 * (3/2) * ( (3/2)+1 ) /2 = 2*1*(1+1)/2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2*1*1 = 2\n             i=3: 3 * (3/3) * ( (3/3)+1 ) /2 = 3*1*(1+1)/2 = 3*1*2/2 = 3\n          total=6+2+3=11.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Another test: n1=0 -> x1=0. Then the second program: n=0, so loop runs 0 times -> ans=0.\n\n  Input:\n      2\n      0\n      5\n\n  Then we take the first test case: n1=0 -> x1=0. Then we read the next 5 and discard.\n  Then we run the second program with 0 -> output 0.\n\n  But the first program would output two lines: \n       0\n       3\n\n  Then the second program would read the first integer 0 and output 0.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as below.\n\nNote: We must use `long long` for `ans` and `tri` to avoid overflow.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly."
