Steps for BFS:\n\n      Initialize a queue. colors[0] = 0 (if we start with length=0) but then we set it at the time of popping? Actually, we mark it when we pop? We should mark it when we push to avoid pushing the same node multiple times. Revised BFS:\n\n      colors[0] = 0; // mark start node\n      enqueue(0, 0);\n\n      while queue not empty:\n          pop node u with accumulated length L.\n          for each neighbor (v, w) of u that is not visited:\n              new_length = L + w\n              color for v = new_length % 2\n              mark colors[v] = (new_length % 2) ? 1 : 0; [but note: we want 0 for even, 1 for odd]\n              enqueue v with new_length\n\n  But note: the original DFS did:\n\n        if (length % 2 == 0) then color=0, else 1. So we do the same. However, the DFS in the original did not use the parent's accumulated length? Actually, it did: it passed (length + length2) to the child. So the BFS version: We start at node0: accumulated length=0 -> color0=0. Then for each neighbor, we compute the accumulated length = 0 + w, then set color = (w % 2) ? But note: the path length is the sum of edge weights from the root. This is correct. Why not? So we can do BFS. We'll change the DFS function to BFS. Let me rewrite the BFS:\n\n      void bfs(int start, int n) {\n          // We use a queue (we can use an array and two pointers)\n          int queue[MAX_N];   // store node indices\n          long long lengths[MAX_N]; // store accumulated lengths for each node? or we can store in the queue structure.\n\n          // Alternatively, we use two arrays: front and rear. int front = 0, rear = 0;\n          // Enqueue the start\n          queue[rear] = start;\n          lengths[rear] = 0;\n          rear++;\n\n          colors[start] = 0;\n\n          while (front < rear) {\n              int u = queue[front];\n              long long L = lengths[front]; // use long long to avoid overflow? but the problem doesn't specify.

And the mod2 of the entire length is the same as the mod2 of the parity of the path? Because: (a+b) mod2 = (a mod2 + b mod2) mod2. So we can break it down by edges. Therefore, the propagation by parity is valid. But to avoid negative modulo issues, we can do:\n\n        w_parity = (w % 2 != 0) ? 1 : 0;   // This is the absolute parity? But note: the parity of w is the same as |w| mod2? Actually, the parity of w is the same as the parity of |w|? and the same as the parity of w mod2 in nonnegative? However, the parity of w is 1 if w is odd, 0 if even. And that is independent of sign. Therefore, we can compute w_parity = abs(w) % 2? But that's overkill. Alternatively, we can do: w_parity = (w & 1) ? 1 : 0;   // This gives the LSB, which is the parity. This works for negative in two's complement. So we'll do:\n\n        int w_parity = (w & 1);\n        // then: colors[v] = (colors[u] + w_parity) % 2;\n\n  But note: if colors[u] is 0 and w_parity=1 -> 1 mod2=1 -> correct. if colors[u] is 1 and w_parity=1 -> 2 mod2=0 -> correct.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. However, note that the first program (atcoder_ABC126_D) reads input and produces output, and the second program (atcoder_ABC125_B) also reads input and produces output. But the problem states that the entire sequence should be translated into a single C program where:\n- Only the first block should handle reading input.\n- Only the last block should handle producing output.\n- Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\nThis implies that we have to chain the two programs such that the output of the first becomes the input of the second? But note: the two programs are independent and read different inputs. However, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nLooking at the two programs:\n\nProgram 1 (ABC126_D):\n  Input: \n      First integer `n`\n      Then `n-1` lines, each containing three integers: u, v, w (representing edges of a tree)\n\n  Output: \n      `n` lines, each being either 0 or 1 (colors for each node)\n\nProgram 2 (ABC125_B):\n  Input:\n      First integer `n`\n      Then a line of `n` integers (values of v)\n      Then a line of `n` integers (costs of c)\n\n  Output: \n      A single integer (max profit)\n\nBut note: the output of program 1 is `n` integers (each 0 or 1) on separate lines. The input of program 2 is:\n  - First an integer `n`\n  - Then a line of `n` integers (for v)\n  - Then a line of `n` integers (for c)\n\nSo the output of program 1 does not match the input of program 2. \n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the two programs are not meant to be chained by the output of the first being the input of the next. However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut wait: the example only has two programs. How can we chain them? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we have a sequence of transformations. But the two programs are independent and read different inputs. \n\nRe-examining the problem: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nSo the entire input to the chain is the input to the first program. Then the output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and so on. The final output is the output of the last program.\n\nBut the two programs have different input formats. How can the output of the first (which is a list of 0/1 of length n) be the input to the second? The second program expects:\n  n\n  v1 v2 ... vn\n  c1 c2 ... cn\n\nThe output of the first program is:\n  color0\n  color1\n  ...\n  color(n-1)\n\nSo if we have the output of the first program as a sequence of n integers (each 0 or 1) on separate lines, we can use that as the second line of input for the second program? But the second program requires two lines after the first integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are independent and the chain is not directly feeding the output of the first to the second? This is confusing.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\". And we are to ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\n\nHowever, the original chain would be:\n\nStep 1: Run program1 on the entire input (which is the input for program1) and produce output1.\nStep 2: Then run program2 using output1 as input? But output1 is not the entire input for program2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the entire input to the chain is the concatenation of the inputs of all programs? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAnother possibility: the two programs are meant to be run on the same initial input? But that doesn't make sense because they read different inputs.\n\nAfter re-examining the two programs, it becomes clear that they are independent and solve two different problems. Therefore, it is likely that the problem intended for us to chain two programs that are dependent. However, the problem does not specify the relationship.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the entire input to the chain is the input for the first program and then the input for the second program? But then the chain would require two separate inputs. The problem says \"when run on the same input\", meaning one input.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the first program is used as part of the input to the second. But the example doesn't show that.\n\nBut wait: the problem states \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must design the C program so that:\n\n  input -> Program1 -> intermediate output (which is the input to Program2) -> Program2 -> final output.\n\nTherefore, we must adjust the second program to take the output of the first as part of its input? But the second program requires three parts: n, list v, list c. The output of the first is a list of n integers (colors). We can use that list as the list for v? and then we still need the list for c? \n\nThe problem does not specify. \n\nAlternatively, the two programs are not chained in the way we think? Or perhaps the example is incorrect.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the intended chain is:\n\n  The entire input for the chain is the input for the first program (ABC126_D) followed by the additional input required for the second program (ABC125_B). That is, the input is:\n\n      [input for ABC126_D] \n      [input for ABC125_B]\n\n  Then the chain runs:\n\n      Step1: Run ABC126_D on the first part of the input (until the end of its input) and produce output1 (which is n lines of 0/1).\n      Step2: Use output1 as the second line of input for ABC125_B? But ABC125_B requires:\n          - an integer n\n          - a line of n integers (v)\n          - a line of n integers (c)\n\n      How do we get the integer n for ABC125_B? It could be the same n as in the first program? But the first program produces a list of n colors. We can use that n for the second program? And then the colors become the v array? Then we still need the c array.\n\n  But the problem says the same input. So we must read the entire input at the beginning.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program takes the output of the first program and the rest of the input (for the c array). \n\n  However, the second program's input format is fixed: \n      n\n      v0 v1 ... v_{n-1}\n      c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}\n\n  We can reinterpret: the output of the first program (the list of colors) is the v array. Then we need to read the n (which is the same as the n from the first program) and the c array.\n\n  But note: the first program already reads n. So the entire input for the chain would be:\n\n      n\n      (n-1 lines for the tree)\n      (then the c array: a line of n integers)\n\n  Then the chain:\n\n      Step1: Run the first program on the first part (n and the n-1 edges) and get the colors (v array for the second program).\n      Step2: The second program uses:\n          n (from the first part)\n          v = colors (from step1)\n          c = the next line of input (the c array)\n\n  Then the second program computes the profit.\n\n  Therefore, the input to the entire chain is:\n\n      n\n      edge1 (u1, v1, w1)\n      edge2 (u2, v2, w2)\n      ...\n      edge_{n-1}\n      c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}\n\n  And the output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\n  This seems a plausible chain.\n\n  Steps in the C program:\n\n      1. Read the integer n.\n      2. Read n-1 edges (each with u, v, w). Note: the Java program subtracts 1 for the vertex indices.\n      3. Run the DFS from the first program to compute the colors array (which becomes the v array for the second program).\n      4. Then read the next line: which is the c array (n integers).\n      5. Then run the second program's logic: for each i from 0 to n-1, compute profit = colors[i] - c[i] (but note: the second program uses v[i] and c[i], and we are using the colors as v?).\n\n  However, note: the colors array from the first program is 0/1. The second program expects arbitrary integers for v. But in this chain, the v array is the colors? That might not make sense in the context of the problem, but the problem does not specify the domain.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem intended the two programs to be independent and the chain is not defined? But the problem says \"meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n  Given the instructions, we must design a chain that uses the output of the first as the input for the second. Therefore, we must reinterpret the input of the second program to be:\n\n      The first integer for the second program is n (which we already have).\n      The second line is the output of the first program (the colors) as n integers? But the colors are 0/1 and the second program expects v as arbitrary integers? \n\n  This chain does not seem to make sense in the real world, but we are forced by the problem.\n\n  Therefore, the C program will do:\n\n      Read n.\n      Read the next n-1 edges (each with three integers).\n      Build the tree and compute the colors array (for the first program).\n      Then read the next line: which is the c array (n integers) for the second program.\n\n      Then, the second program will use:\n          n (already read)\n          v = colors (the array we just computed, which is of 0/1)\n          c = the array we just read\n\n      Then compute: for i=0 to n-1, if (v[i] - c[i]) > 0, then add that to max.\n\n      Then output max.\n\n  But note: the first program outputs the colors array to stdout. However, in the chain, we are not to output it? Only the last block should produce output. So we skip outputting the colors array and use it internally.\n\n  So we must combine the two programs without the intermediate output.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Read n.\n      For i from 0 to n-2: read an edge (three integers: u, v, w). Note: the Java program subtracts 1 to make 0-indexed.\n\n      Then run the DFS of the first program to compute the colors array (but without printing it).\n\n      Then read the next line: which is the c array. But note: the second program in Java reads a line of n integers for v and then a line for c. However, in our chain, we are not reading the v array from input because we are using the colors as v. So we skip reading the v array? But the input after the edges is only the c array? \n\n      How was the input for the chain structured? We have:\n\n          n\n          edge1 (u1, v1, w1)\n          ... (n-1 edges)\n          c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}\n\n      But the second program originally reads:\n\n          n\n          v0 v1 ... v_{n-1}\n          c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}\n\n      In our chain, we are not going to read the v array because we are generating it from the first program. Therefore, the input after the edges is only the c array.\n\n      However, the problem says \"the same input\". But originally, the two programs were run separately with their own inputs. Now we are combining the inputs.\n\n      The problem does not specify the exact combined input format, but we must design the chain so that the entire input is read at the beginning.\n\n      Therefore, the input to the C program is:\n\n          n\n          n-1 edges (each: u v w)\n          one line of n integers for c\n\n      And the v array for the second program is the colors array from the first.\n\n  This matches the chain.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      Step 1: Read n.\n      Step 2: Build the graph with n-1 edges.\n      Step 3: Run DFS to compute colors[0..n-1] (0-indexed, each 0 or 1).\n      Step 4: Read the next n integers (the c array).\n      Step 5: For i from 0 to n-1:\n                  profit_i = colors[i] - c[i]\n                  if (profit_i > 0) then add to total.\n      Step 6: Print total.\n\n  However, note: the second program in Java uses a map for v and c? Actually, it uses:\n\n        Map<Integer, Integer> vList = str2List(vStr);\n        Map<Integer, Integer> cList = str2List(cStr);\n\n  Then iterates from i=0 to n-1.\n\n  We can simply use arrays.\n\n  Important: the first program uses 0-indexed nodes. The colors array is indexed by node index (0 to n-1). We will use the same.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the DFS in the first program uses recursion. We must be cautious for stack size in C for large n? But the problem doesn't specify constraints. We'll assume n is moderate.\n\n  Steps in C:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      #define MAX_N 100000 // we'll set a maximum\n\n      // We'll represent the graph as an adjacency list.\n      typedef struct Node {\n          int vertex;\n          int weight;\n          struct Node* next;\n      } Node;\n\n      Node* graph[MAX_N];\n      int colors[MAX_N]; // for the DFS result\n\n      // We'll maintain a visited array for DFS? The Java program uses the colors array for that (with -1 for unvisited).\n      // In C, we can initialize colors to -1.\n\n      // Function to add an edge (undirected)\n      void add_edge(int u, int v, int w) {\n          Node* new_node = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));\n          new_node->vertex = v;\n          new_node->weight = w;\n          new_node->next = graph[u];\n          graph[u] = new_node;\n\n          new_node = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));\n          new_node->vertex = u;\n          new_node->weight = w;\n          new_node->next = graph[v];\n          graph[v] = new_node;\n      }\n\n      // DFS using a stack? The original uses recursion. We'll do recursion but note: recursion depth might be n, which can be 10^5 -> stack overflow in C by default.\n      // We change to iterative DFS? Or use an explicit stack.\n\n      // Alternatively, we can use BFS? The tree is undirected and connected.\n\n      // We'll use iterative DFS with a stack.\n\n      typedef struct {\n          int node;\n          int length; // the accumulated length from the root\n      } StackElem;\n\n      void dfs(int start, int n) {\n          // We'll use an array for visited? We use colors: -1 means not visited.\n          // We use a stack (array-based)\n          StackElem stack[MAX_N];\n          int top = -1;\n\n          // Push the start node\n          top++;\n          stack[top].node = start;\n          stack[top].length = 0;\n\n          while (top >= 0) {\n              StackElem cur = stack[top];\n              top--;\n\n              if (colors[cur.node] != -1) {\n                  // already visited\n                  continue;\n              }\n\n              // set the color for this node\n              colors[cur.node] = (cur.length % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1;\n\n              // Traverse all neighbors\n              Node* adj = graph[cur.node];\n              while (adj != NULL) {\n                  int neighbor = adj->vertex;\n                  int weight = adj->weight;\n                  if (colors[neighbor] == -1) {\n                      top++;\n                      stack[top].node = neighbor;\n                      stack[top].length = cur.length + weight;\n                  }\n                  adj = adj->next;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n          // Initialize graph: set all to NULL\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              graph[i] = NULL;\n          }\n\n          // Initialize colors to -1 (unvisited)\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              colors[i] = -1;\n          }\n\n          // Read n-1 edges\n          for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n              int u, v, w;\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &u, &v, &w);\n              u--; v--; // convert to 0-indexed\n              add_edge(u, v, w);\n          }\n\n          // Run DFS starting from node0 (which is node0 in 0-indexed)\n          dfs(0, n);\n\n          // Now read the c array (n integers)\n          int c_array[MAX_N];\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &c_array[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Now, the colors array is our v_array? for the second program.\n          int total = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              int profit = colors[i] - c_array[i];\n              if (profit > 0) {\n                  total += profit;\n              }\n          }\n\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", total);\n\n          // Free the graph memory? (optional for a program that ends)\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, note: the DFS in the original Java program used recursion and the tree might be deep. We are using an iterative DFS to avoid stack overflow.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the constraints. We'll assume n can be up to 100000.\n\n  Also note: the DFS in the original started at node0 and the accumulated length mod2 determines the color.\n\n  We have to be careful: the iterative DFS must push the correct accumulated length for each node.\n\n  But note: the DFS in the original did not use parent pointers to avoid going back? We are using the colors array to mark visited, so we avoid revisiting.\n\n  However, the original DFS was recursive and naturally avoided the parent by the visited flag. Our iterative DFS does the same.\n\n  But the graph is a tree, so we can also use BFS.\n\n  Let me change to BFS to be safe (and avoid deep recursion in the DFS stack). Actually, we are using an explicit stack, so it's iterative DFS. But the stack might still grow as n. However, the worst-case stack size is n, which is acceptable if we allocate enough on the stack? But 100000 is acceptable in many systems for the stack.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a queue for BFS? The DFS order doesn't matter because the tree is undirected and we are just propagating the accumulated length. Actually, BFS would work too because the tree is unrooted? We start at 0 and then traverse level by level? But the length is the sum of weights, not the number of edges.\n\n  However, the DFS in the original traversed arbitrarily. The iterative DFS we implemented is actually DFS (last neighbor pushed will be popped first). But the problem doesn't specify order. The condition for color is: (accumulated_length % 2). So as long as we accumulate the length from the root to the node, the order doesn't matter.\n\n  We can do BFS? Actually, we can. The accumulated length from the root to a node is the same regardless of the order we traverse. But note: the edges have weights, so we must add the weight when traversing.\n\n  Since the graph is a tree, we can do:\n\n      We start at node0 with length=0.\n      Then we traverse all neighbors of node0, then neighbors of neighbors, etc.\n\n      We can use a queue.\n\n  Let me do BFS to avoid deep recursion and also because it's more efficient in terms of memory (queue vs stack: both can be O(n), but BFS is more cache friendly).\n\n  Steps for BFS:\n\n      Initialize a queue.\n      colors[0] = 0 (if we start with length=0) but then we set it at the time of popping? Actually, we mark it when we pop? We should mark it when we push to avoid pushing the same node multiple times.\n\n  Revised BFS:\n\n      colors[0] = 0; // mark start node\n      enqueue(0, 0);\n\n      while queue not empty:\n          pop node u with accumulated length L.\n          for each neighbor (v, w) of u that is not visited:\n              new_length = L + w\n              color for v = new_length % 2\n              mark colors[v] = (new_length % 2) ? 1 : 0; [but note: we want 0 for even, 1 for odd]\n              enqueue v with new_length\n\n  But note: the original DFS did:\n\n        if (length % 2 == 0) then color=0, else 1.\n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  However, the DFS in the original did not use the parent's accumulated length? Actually, it did: it passed (length + length2) to the child.\n\n  So the BFS version:\n\n      We start at node0: accumulated length=0 -> color0=0.\n\n      Then for each neighbor, we compute the accumulated length = 0 + w, then set color = (w % 2) ? But note: the path length is the sum of edge weights from the root.\n\n      This is correct.\n\n  Why not? So we can do BFS.\n\n  We'll change the DFS function to BFS.\n\n  Let me rewrite the BFS:\n\n      void bfs(int start, int n) {\n          // We use a queue (we can use an array and two pointers)\n          int queue[MAX_N];   // store node indices\n          long long lengths[MAX_N]; // store accumulated lengths for each node? or we can store in the queue structure.\n\n          // Alternatively, we use two arrays: front and rear.\n          int front = 0, rear = 0;\n          // Enqueue the start\n          queue[rear] = start;\n          lengths[rear] = 0;\n          rear++;\n\n          colors[start] = 0;\n\n          while (front < rear) {\n              int u = queue[front];\n              long long L = lengths[front]; // use long long to avoid overflow? but the problem doesn't specify. The mod2 only cares about parity, so we can mod2 at each step? Actually, we only need the mod2 value.\n\n              // But the mod2 of the entire length: we can do L % 2, but we can also just keep a parity bit? \n              // Actually, we don't need the entire length, only mod2. We can store the parity as an integer (0 or 1) and update: new_parity = (current_parity + w) % 2? \n              // But (a+b) mod2 = (a mod2 + b mod2) mod2.\n\n              // However, the original used the entire length. But mod2 is linear.\n\n              // We can store the parity as we go.\n\n              // But the original program used the entire length. However, since we only care mod2, we can just use the parity.\n\n              // How about we change: we store the parity (0 or 1) for the node? Actually, we are storing the color which is the parity.\n\n              // But to compute the parity for the neighbor: \n              //   new_parity = (current_parity + w) % 2.\n\n              // We can do that.\n\n              // Let me change: we don't need to store the entire length, only the parity.\n\n              // Actually, we can avoid big integers.\n\n              // So we'll store the parity of the accumulated length for the node.\n\n              // But note: we are storing the color for u: which is the parity of the accumulated length to u.\n\n              // Now, for each edge (u, v, w): \n              //   the accumulated length for v = L + w -> parity = (L_parity + w_parity) % 2.\n\n              // We can precompute: w_parity = w % 2.\n\n              // Then color for v = (colors[u] + (w % 2)) % 2.\n\n              // This is equivalent.\n\n              // We'll use this to propagate.\n\n              // So we don't need to store the entire length.\n\n              // Now, traverse all neighbors of u:\n              Node* adj = graph[u];\n              while (adj != NULL) {\n                  int v = adj->vertex;\n                  if (colors[v] == -1) { // not visited\n                      // compute the parity for v: (colors[u] + (adj->weight % 2)) % 2\n                      colors[v] = (colors[u] + (adj->weight % 2)) % 2;\n                      // Then enqueue v\n                      queue[rear] = v;\n                      // But note: we don't need the entire length, so we don't store a length for v? We are storing the color which is the parity.\n                      rear++;\n                  }\n                  adj = adj->next;\n              }\n              front++;\n          }\n      }\n\n  However, note: the original DFS used the entire length mod2. And the above propagation is equivalent because:\n\n      Let L_u = accumulated length to u (mod2) = colors[u]\n      Then L_v = L_u + w (mod2) = (colors[u] + (w mod2)) mod2.\n\n  So we can do that.\n\n  This is more efficient and avoids big integers.\n\n  But the problem: the original mod2 was on the entire length. But mod2 is linear, so it's the same.\n\n  So we'll do BFS with parity propagation.\n\n  Steps for BFS:\n\n      colors[0] = 0;\n      enqueue node0.\n\n      while queue not empty:\n          u = dequeue\n          for each neighbor v of u that is unvisited:\n              colors[v] = (colors[u] + (w % 2)) % 2;\n              enqueue v\n\n  Note: w % 2: if w is negative? The problem says: the input for the edge: u, v, w. The constraints? The problem doesn't specify. The Java program uses mod2: it does %2 which in Java for negative can be negative? Actually, in Java: (-5) % 2 is -1. Then we add to colors[u] (0 or 1) and then mod2? \n\n  But we want a non-negative mod2? We can do: (w % 2 + 2) % 2 to get 0 or 1? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use: w & 1? That gives the least significant bit. But note: for negative, the representation is two's complement: the LSB is the same as for positive? Actually, the parity of negative numbers: -5 has parity 1? because -5 = ...11111111111111111111111111111011 -> last bit is 1.\n\n  However, the problem does not say that w is positive. But the original Java program did: \n        if (length % 2 == 0) \n  which for negative: \n        -4 % 2 is 0? and -5 % 2 is -1? which is not 0 -> so it would set color=1? \n\n  But we want: \n        -4 mod2 = 0? and -5 mod2 = 1? \n\n  Actually, mathematically, we want the parity: which is the same as the absolute value mod2? \n\n  But note: in modular arithmetic, mod2 should be in {0,1}. \n\n  We can adjust: \n        int w_parity = (w % 2 + 2) % 2;\n\n  But that doesn't work for negative? \n        w=-5: (-5 % 2) = -1 (in C) -> then (-1+2)%2 = 1%2=1 -> correct.\n        w=-4: (-4 % 2) = 0 -> (0+2)%2=2%2=0 -> correct.\n\n  However, in C, the modulo operation for negative numbers is implementation-defined? \n\n  From the C standard: the sign of the result of % is the same as the dividend. But we want the modulus in [0,1]. \n\n  We can use: \n        int w_parity = (w & 1) ? 1 : 0;\n  But that is not the same: \n        w=-5: in two's complement, the LSB is 1 -> so 1.\n        w=-4: LSB is 0 -> 0.\n\n  This matches the mathematical parity.\n\n  But note: the original Java program used %2. And in Java, (-5)%2 is -1. Then we add to colors[u] (which is 0 or 1) and then mod2? \n\n        (-1 + 0) %2 = -1 %2 = -1 -> then we set color=1? because the condition was: if (length%2==0) -> no, else 1? \n        But the original program did not use this propagation. It used the entire length.\n\n  To be consistent with the original, we should use the entire length mod2? But the entire length might be huge? and we are only storing the parity? \n\n  Actually, the original DFS passed the entire length to the next. But then mod2 at the next node. And the mod2 of the entire length is the same as the mod2 of the parity of the path? \n\n  Because: (a+b) mod2 = (a mod2 + b mod2) mod2.\n\n  So we can break it down by edges.\n\n  Therefore, the propagation by parity is valid.\n\n  But to avoid negative modulo issues, we can do:\n\n        w_parity = (w % 2 != 0) ? 1 : 0;   // This is the absolute parity? But note: the parity of w is the same as |w| mod2? \n        Actually, the parity of w is the same as the parity of |w|? and the same as the parity of w mod2 in nonnegative? \n\n        However, the parity of w is 1 if w is odd, 0 if even. And that is independent of sign.\n\n  Therefore, we can compute w_parity = abs(w) % 2? But that's overkill.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do: w_parity = (w & 1) ? 1 : 0;   // This gives the LSB, which is the parity.\n\n  This works for negative in two's complement.\n\n  So we'll do:\n\n        int w_parity = (w & 1);\n        // then: \n        colors[v] = (colors[u] + w_parity) % 2;\n\n  But note: if colors[u] is 0 and w_parity=1 -> 1 mod2=1 -> correct.\n        if colors[u] is 1 and w_parity=1 -> 2 mod2=0 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, we can do BFS with this.\n\n  However, note: the original DFS did not use the absolute value? It used the given weight. But the parity is the same.\n\n  So the BFS function:\n\n      void bfs(int start, int n) {\n          int queue[MAX_N];\n          int front = 0, rear = 0;\n\n          colors[start] = 0;\n          queue[rear++] = start;\n\n          while (front < rear) {\n              int u = queue[front++];\n              Node* adj = graph[u];\n              while (adj != NULL) {\n                  int v = adj->vertex;\n                  if (colors[v] == -1) {\n                      int w_parity = adj->weight & 1;\n                      colors[v] = (colors[u] + w_parity) % 2;\n                      queue[rear++] = v;\n                  }\n                  adj = adj->next;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  This is efficient.\n\n  Now, we can change the DFS call to BFS.\n\n  The entire C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n\n      #define MAX_N 100000\n\n      typedef struct Node {\n          int vertex;\n          int weight;\n          struct Node* next;\n      } Node;\n\n      Node* graph[MAX_N];\n      int colors[MAX_N]; // for the BFS result\n\n      void add_edge(int u, int v, int w) {\n          Node* new_node = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));\n          new_node->vertex = v;\n          new_node->weight = w;\n          new_node->next = graph[u];\n          graph[u] = new_node;\n\n          new_node = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));\n          new_node->vertex = u;\n          new_node->weight = w;\n          new_node->next = graph[v];\n          graph[v] = new_node;\n      }\n\n      void bfs(int start, int n) {\n          int queue[MAX_N];\n          int front = 0, rear = 0;\n\n          colors[start] = 0;\n          queue[rear++] = start;\n\n          while (front < rear) {\n              int u = queue[front++];\n              Node* adj = graph[u];\n              while (adj != NULL) {\n                  int v = adj->vertex;\n                  if (colors[v] == -1) {\n                      int w_parity = adj->weight & 1;\n                      colors[v] = (colors[u] + w_parity) % 2;\n                      queue[rear++] = v;\n                  }\n                  adj = adj->next;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n          // Initialize graph and colors\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              graph[i] = NULL;\n              colors[i] = -1;\n          }\n\n          // Read n-1 edges\n          for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n              int u, v, w;\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &u, &v, &w);\n              u--; v--; // to 0-indexed\n              add_edge(u, v, w);\n          }\n\n          // Run BFS from node0\n          bfs(0, n);\n\n          // Read the c array (n integers)\n          int c_array[MAX_N];\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &c_array[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Compute the total profit: v_i = colors[i]\n          int total = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              int profit = colors[i] - c_array[i];\n              if (profit > 0) {\n                  total += profit;\n              }\n          }\n\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", total);\n\n          // Free the graph? We can, but the program ends.\n          // For each node, free the linked list.\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              Node* adj = graph[i];\n              while (adj != NULL) {\n                  Node* temp = adj;\n                  adj = adj->next;\n                  free(temp);\n              }\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  Let me test with a small example.\n\n  Example for first program (from the problem?):\n\n      Input for first program: \n          3\n          1 2 2\n          2 3 1\n\n      Then the DFS/BFS: \n          node0: color0=0.\n          Then from node0 (index0) to node1 (index1): weight=2 -> parity0, so color1 = (0+0)%2=0.\n          Then from node0 to node2: we don't have that edge? The edges: \n              edge1: 1-2 -> becomes 0-1 (weight=2)\n              edge2: 2-3 -> becomes 1-2 (weight=1)\n\n          So the graph:\n            node0: connected to node1 (weight2)\n            node1: connected to node0 (weight2) and node2 (weight1)\n            node2: connected to node1 (weight1)\n\n          BFS: \n            Start node0: color0=0.\n            Then from node0: we go to node1: color1 = (0+0)%2=0 -> enqueue node1.\n            Then from node1: we go to node0 (visited) and node2: \n                   node2: from node1 (color0) and weight1 (parity1) -> color2 = (0+1)%2=1.\n\n          So colors: [0,0,1]\n\n      Then the input for the second part: the c array? \n          The chain input then has: \n             3\n             1 2 2\n             2 3 1\n             [then the c array]: say \"1 2 3\"\n\n          So c_array = [1,2,3]\n\n          Then profit for node0: 0 - 1 = -1 -> skip.\n          node1: 0-2=-2 -> skip.\n          node2: 1-3=-2 -> skip.\n          total=0.\n\n      Output: 0.\n\n  But the original first program would have output:\n      0\n      0\n      1\n\n  Then the second program: \n        n=3\n        v: [0,0,1]   (if we use that as the v array)\n        c: [1,2,3]\n        profit: 0-1=-1 (skip), 0-2=-2 (skip), 1-3=-2 (skip) -> total=0.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  However, note: the input for the second program originally was read from stdin. In the chain, we are reading the c array from the next part of the input.\n\n  Therefore, the entire C program is as above.\n\n  But note: the original first program output the colors for each node (n lines). In our chain, we don't output them. We use them as the v array for the second program.\n\n  This is the intended chain.\n\n  We assume the maximum n is 100000. We set MAX_N to 100000.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the BFS function has a queue of size MAX_N, which is acceptable.\n\n  We'll write the code.\n\n  Note: the second program in Java used a map for v and c? But we are using arrays.\n\n  We are using the colors array as the v array.\n\n  We'll output the total profit.\n\n  Code:"
