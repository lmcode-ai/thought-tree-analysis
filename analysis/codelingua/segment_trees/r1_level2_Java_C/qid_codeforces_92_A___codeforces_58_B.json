This produces the chain of divisors: the next divisor must divide the previous divisor. Example: \n   Input to the second program: 10\n   Output:\n        10 \n        5 \n        1 Because: \n        m=10, then i=9,8,...,5: 10%5==0 -> print 5, then m=5.\n        then i=4,3,2: none divides 5? until i=1: 5%1==0 -> print 1. But note: 10%10==0? but we start i from n-1 (which is 9) so we skip 10. But we already printed 10. So the algorithm of the second program:\n   - Print the starting number n (with a space and newline).\n   - Set m = n.\n   - Then for i from n-1 down to 1:\n        if m % i == 0, then print i (with space and newline) and set m = i.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n   Read n0 and k0 (for the first program). // First program logic:\n        int n = n0, k = k0;\n        int i = 1, req = 1;\n        while (k >= req) {\n            k -= req;\n            i++;\n            if (i % n0 ! = 0) { req = i % n0;\n            } else {\n                req = n0;\n            }\n        }\n        // Now k is the remaining chips (which we call x)\n\n   Then set n_second = k;   // because the first program's output is k (remaining) Then for the second program:\n        int m = n_second;\n        // Print the starting number: \n        printf(\"%d \\n\", n_second);   // note: we are including a space and then a newline. for (int i_val = n_second - 1; i_val > 0; i_val--) {\n            if (m % i_val == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", i_val);\n                m = i_val;\n            }\n        }\n\nBut wait: the first program uses a variable `n` which is n0 (the initial n). We must not confuse it with the n for the second program. Let me rename: Let initial_n = n0, and initial_k = k0. Then we compute the remaining_k. Then set second_n = remaining_k. Then run the second program on second_n. However, note: the first program uses `n` (which is initial_n) throughout.",

But in the first program, the variable `n` is read at the beginning and never changed. So the C code:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        int initial_n, initial_k;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &initial_n, &initial_k);\n\n        // First program logic\n        int i = 1, req = 1;\n        int k = initial_k;\n        while (k >= req) { k -= req;\n            i++;\n            if (i % initial_n ! = 0) { req = i % initial_n;\n            } else {\n                req = initial_n;\n            }\n        }\n        // Now k is the result of the first program (remaining chips)\n\n        int second_n = k;\n\n        // Second program logic\n        int m = second_n;\n        printf(\"%d \\n\", second_n);   // note the space\n\n        for (int i_val = second_n - 1; i_val > 0; i_val--) {\n            if (m % i_val == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", i_val);   // also with a space and then newline\n                m = i_val;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\nBut note: the first program's while condition is: while (k - req >= 0) \n   which is equivalent to while (k >= req) So we have that. However, let me test the first program with a small example. Example: n0=3, k0=10.\n\n   i=1, req=1: k>=1 -> k=9, i=2 -> req = 2 (because 2%3=2)\n   i=2, req=2: k=9-2=7, i=3 -> req=3 (because 3%3=0 -> so req=3)\n   i=3, req=3: k=7-3=4, i=4 -> req=4%3=1\n   i=4, req=1: k=4-1=3, i=5 -> req=5%3=2\n   i=5, req=2: k=3-2=1, i=6 -> req=6%3=0 -> 3\n   Now k=1, req=3 -> 1<3 -> break. Output: 1. Then the second program gets 1:\n   prints \"1 \\n\"\n   then for i_val from 0 down to 1? Actually, for i_val = 1-1 = 0; the loop condition i_val>0 fails. So only prints \"1 \\n\"\n\nBut the original first program would output 1 (without space) and then the second program would output \"1 \\n\". But in our C program, we only output the second program's output: \"1 \\n\".",

But note: the second program in the original prints a space and then a newline. So each number is printed as: \n   [number] [space] [newline]\n\nSo we are doing the same. Therefore, the C code as below. However, note the first program's logic: the condition in the while loop is checked again inside? Original Java (first program):\n   while (k - req >= 0) {\n        if (k - req >= 0) {\n            k = k - req;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n        ... \n   }\n\nThis is redundant: the condition is already checked in the while. We can remove the inner if. But to be faithful, we can write it as:\n\n   while (k >= req) { k -= req;\n        ... \n   }\n\nBecause the break is never taken inside the loop (since the while condition ensures k>=req). So we can simplify. Let me write the entire C code accordingly. Note: We must be cautious with the variable names. Final code:",

The output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nFirst Java program (codeforces_92_A):\n  Reads two integers: n and k.\n  It then simulates giving out i%n (or n if divisible) chips to each child in turn until there aren't enough.\n  The remaining chips (k) are printed.\n\nSecond Java program (codeforces_58_B):\n  Reads an integer n.\n  Prints a sequence of numbers starting with n, then the next largest divisor of n, then the next, until 1.\n\nThe challenge: \n  The entire sequence should be translated into a single C program without I/O in the middle.\n\nPlan:\n  1. The first program outputs a single integer (the remaining chips after the process).\n  2. This integer becomes the input to the second program.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  - Read the initial two integers (n and k) for the first part.\n  - Process the first part to get a result (let's call it 'remaining').\n  - Then use 'remaining' as the input to the second part.\n\nBut note: the second program in the original reads an integer from standard input. However, in our chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\nSo in the C program:\n  - We read two integers: n0 and k0 (for the first program).\n  - Run the logic of the first program to compute the remaining chips, say 'result1'.\n  - Then we set n = result1 and run the second program.\n\nHowever, note that the second program prints a sequence of numbers. We must capture the entire output of the chain.\n\nBut the problem says: only the first block reads input and only the last block produces output.\n\nTherefore, we must combine the two programs so that:\n  - The first part (originally reading n0 and k0) reads from stdin.\n  - The second part uses the output of the first (without reading again) and then prints the final sequence.\n\nBut note: the second program in the original prints multiple numbers (each followed by a space) and then the program ends. The first program only prints one number.\n\nSo the overall output of the chain would be the output of the second program, which is a sequence of numbers.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read n and k for the first program.\n2. Simulate the first program to get the remaining k (let's call it result1).\n3. Then, for the second program, we set n = result1.\n4. Run the second program: \n     - Print the current n (with a space) and then set m = n.\n     - Then for i from n-1 down to 1, if m % i == 0, then print i and set m = i.\n\nHowever, note the output format of the second program: \n     System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This prints n and then a space and then a newline? \n     But then the next prints are: System.out.println(i + \" \"); // which also prints a space and then a newline.\n\nBut the example output might not be exactly as the problem expects? However, we are to reproduce the same behavior.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if the original second program prints each number on a new line, then we must do the same.\n\nBut looking at the second program: \n   It uses System.out.println, which prints the string and then a newline.\n\nSo the output is:\n   n\n   next number\n   ... \n   until 1.\n\nBut wait: the first program prints the remaining k (without any extra spaces) and then a newline? \n   Yes: System.out.println(k); \n\nThen the second program reads that integer and then prints a sequence of numbers each on a new line.\n\nTherefore, the overall output of the chain is:\n   The output of the first program: a single integer (on a line by itself)\n   Then the output of the second program: a sequence of integers, each on a new line.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the output of the first becomes the input to the second. So the second program reads the first integer (the output of the first) and then prints its sequence.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that we have a single C program without I/O in the middle. So we are not allowed to print the intermediate result and then read it again. We must pass the data internally.\n\nTherefore, the overall output of the entire C program should be the output of the second program? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"reproduces the same behavior\" when run on the same input.\n\nThe original chain would be:\n   Input: two integers (n0 and k0) for the first program.\n   Output of first program: an integer (say x) printed to stdout.\n   Then the second program is run with input x, and it prints a sequence of integers (each on a new line).\n\nSo the overall output is:\n   x\n   then the sequence of divisors in decreasing order, each on a new line.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we are not to run two separate programs, but we are to simulate the entire chain.\n\nTherefore, the C program should:\n   - Read n0 and k0 (the initial input).\n   - Compute x (the result of the first program) without printing it (because we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle).\n   - Then use x as the input to the second program, which then prints the entire sequence (starting with x, then the divisors).\n\nBut wait: the second program in the original prints the input number (x) and then the divisors. So the entire output of the chain is:\n   x\n   then the divisors (each on a new line).\n\nBut note: the first program originally printed x. Then the second program prints x again? \n\nSo the overall output would be:\n   x (from the first program)\n   x (again from the second program)\n   then the divisors.\n\nBut that's not what we want. The problem says: the entire chain on the same input.\n\nActually, the chain is:\n   Input to the first: n0, k0.\n   Output of the first: x (to stdout).\n   Then the second program is run with input x (so it reads x from stdin).\n   Then the second program prints: \n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // which is x and then a space and a newline? Actually, it prints x and then a space and then a newline? \n        Then it prints the divisors each on a new line (with a space and a newline?).\n\nBut the second program's output is:\n   x \n   then divisor1\n   then divisor2\n   ... until 1.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs x (without any extra space) and then a newline? \n   Yes: System.out.println(k); -> prints the integer and then a newline.\n\nThen the second program outputs:\n   x (again) and then a space and a newline? Actually, the code: \n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n   This will convert n to string, then append a space and then print the whole string and then a newline.\n\n   For example, if n=10, then it prints \"10 \\n\".\n\nSo the overall output would be:\n   Line1: x (from first program)\n   Line2: x followed by a space (from second program) and then a newline? \n   Then the divisors each printed as: divisor followed by a space and then a newline.\n\nBut that would be:\n   Line1: x\n   Line2: x \n   Then the divisors.\n\nBut wait, the second program's first output is the same x? So we are getting two lines: the first with x and the second with x and a space? \n\nActually, the first program outputs: \n   x\\n\n\nThe second program outputs:\n   (x + \" \")\\n   -> which is x, a space, and then a newline.\n\nSo the overall output is:\n   x\n   x [space]\n   divisor1 [space]\n   divisor2 [space]\n   ...\n\nBut that is not the same as the original chain? \n\nWe must note: the second program is reading the output of the first. The first outputs an integer and a newline. The second program's scanner will read that integer (ignoring the newline) and then the second program prints that integer with a space and a newline.\n\nSo the overall output of the chain is:\n   The first program writes: x\\n\n   The second program writes: x \\n\n   Then the divisors: each as d \\n.\n\nSo the entire output is:\n   x\\n\n   x \\n\n   d1 \\n\n   d2 \\n\n   ...\n\nBut the problem says: we are not to do I/O in the middle. Therefore, we cannot print the intermediate x. We must only print the final output of the chain.\n\nWhat is the final output of the chain? It is the output of the second program. However, the second program's output includes the input number (x) as the first line of its output? \n\nBut note: the second program does not know that the input came from the first program. It just reads an integer and then prints a sequence starting with that integer.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output should be the same as if we ran the two programs: \n   First: reads n0, k0 and outputs x (a single integer on a line).\n   Then second: reads x and outputs:\n        x (with a space and then a newline)\n        then the divisors (each with a space and a newline).\n\nBut we are not allowed to output the intermediate x. We are only allowed to output the final result.\n\nSo we must suppress the intermediate output? \n\nThe problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nTherefore, we must not print the intermediate result (x) at the time of the first program. Instead, we pass x to the second program without printing. Then the second program will print the entire sequence including x.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program will only output what the second program would output: \n   first line: x (with a space and a newline) \n   then the divisors (each with a space and a newline).\n\nBut note: the original chain outputs the intermediate x (on a line by itself) and then the second program's output. \n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior when run on the same input\". \n\nThe original behavior is that the entire chain writes:\n   Line1: x (without any trailing space, just the integer and a newline)   [from the first program]\n   Line2: x (with a space and a newline)   [from the second program]\n   Then the divisors.\n\nBut if we skip printing the intermediate x, then the output of the entire chain would be only the second program's output, which is:\n   Line1: x (with a space and a newline)\n   Line2: divisor (with a space and a newline)\n   ...\n\nSo we are missing the first line (the intermediate x) and the second program's first line has an extra space.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nWe must reconsider: the problem says the entire sequence. The chain is defined as the output of the first being the input to the second. The overall output is the output of the second program? \n\nBut note: the problem does not say that the overall output should be only the last program's output. It says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The same behavior is that the entire chain writes the intermediate result and then the second program's result.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\".\n\nSo we are not allowed to print the intermediate x. Therefore, we must not print it. \n\nBut then the input to the second program is the same x, and the second program prints x (with a space) as the first line. So the overall output of the chain (if we skip the intermediate print) is:\n   x (with a space and newline)\n   divisor1 (with a space and newline)\n   ...\n\nHowever, the original chain had an extra line at the beginning: the integer x without a space.\n\nSo the outputs are different.\n\nThis implies that the problem intended that the intermediate outputs are not printed? But then the chain would be broken because the second program would not get the input.\n\nTherefore, we must reinterpret: the problem says the entire sequence is translated into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior. The same behavior means that the entire output (to stdout) of the chain is the same as if we ran the two programs.\n\nBut if we run the two programs, the intermediate output (the first program's output) is part of the overall output? \n\nYes, and then the second program's output is appended.\n\nSo the entire output is the concatenation: \n   [Output of first program] \n   [Output of second program]\n\nTherefore, we must output the intermediate result (the x) and then the output of the second program? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" \n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nLet me reread: \n   \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nBut note: the entire sequence is translated into a single program. The first block (which originally read) will be the only one reading. The last block (which originally wrote) will be the only one writing. \n\nHowever, the intermediate block (the first program) originally produced output. But in the chain, that output is fed to the next program. In the single C program, we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle. \n\nTherefore, we must not print the intermediate result. Instead, we pass the value as an internal variable.\n\nBut then the output of the entire program should be the output of the second program? \n\nBut the second program's output includes the input number (x) at the beginning? \n\nSo the entire output of the chain (if we run the two programs) is:\n   x\\n\n   x \\n\n   divisor1 \\n\n   ...\n\nBut if we only run the second program (with input x) we get:\n   x \\n\n   divisor1 \\n\n   ...\n\nSo we are missing the first line (the x without space).\n\nTo get the same behavior, we must output:\n   x\\n\n   x \\n\n   divisor1 \\n\n   ...\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". \n\nThis means we are only allowed to have output in the last block (the second program). \n\nBut the second program, as written, only outputs the sequence starting with x (with a space). It does not output the initial x without a space.\n\nTherefore, we must adjust the second program to also output the initial x without a space? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire chain has two outputs: \n   The first program outputs x (without space) and then the second program outputs x (with space) and the divisors.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence is translated into a single C program. And we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle. So we cannot print the intermediate x.\n\nThis leads to a dilemma.\n\nAfter careful thought, the intended meaning is likely that the entire chain's output is only the output of the last program? But that does not match the chain.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the intermediate results are passed as internal variables and only the final output (which is the output of the last program) is printed.\n\nBut then the output would be different.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's output is the final output.\n\nBut in reality, the first program's output is printed to stdout and then the second program reads from stdin. The entire system then has two outputs: the first program's output and the second program's output.\n\nBut if we run the two programs in a pipe: \n   $ java First | java Second\n\nThen the overall output (what the user sees) is only the output of the second program? \n\nNo, actually the pipe connects the stdout of the first to the stdin of the second. The stdout of the second is then the only output the user sees? \n\nBut wait, the user sees the output of the second program. The first program's output is not seen by the user; it is consumed by the second program.\n\nTherefore, the overall output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\nSo the entire chain should output only what the second program outputs.\n\nTherefore, we do not need to output the intermediate x. We only output the second program's output.\n\nBut then the second program's output includes the integer x (with a space and a newline) and then the divisors.\n\nSo the C program should:\n   Read n0 and k0.\n   Compute x (the result of the first program) without printing it.\n   Then run the second program with n = x, which prints:\n        printf(\"%d \\n\", x);   // for the first number\n        then for i from x-1 down to 1, if m%i==0, then printf(\"%d \\n\", i); and set m=i.\n\nBut note: the second program in the original prints each number with a space and then a newline? \n   Yes: System.out.println(n + \" \"); \n        This is equivalent to: \n            System.out.print(n);\n            System.out.print(\" \");\n            System.out.println();   // which prints a newline.\n\n        So it's: n, then a space, then a newline.\n\n   Similarly for the divisors.\n\nBut the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must output:\n   \"x \\n\"\n   \"d1 \\n\"\n   \"d2 \\n\"\n   ...\n\nBut the original first program output was just \"x\\n\" (without space). However, that was consumed by the second program and not seen by the user. The user only sees the output of the second program.\n\nTherefore, we only output what the second program outputs.\n\nBut wait: the second program does not output the intermediate x without space? It outputs it with space. So that's what the user sees.\n\nTherefore, the C program should do:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and k (for the first program).\n   Step 2: Compute the remaining k (x) from the first program's logic.\n   Step 3: Then set n = x for the second program.\n   Step 4: Print the entire sequence as the second program would: \n        printf(\"%d \\n\", n);   // note the space after %d\n        then for i from n-1 down to 1:\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n                m = i;\n            }\n\nBut note: the second program sets m = n initially, then for i from n-1 down to 1.\n\nHowever, there is a nuance: the second program in the original prints the divisors in decreasing order, but only those that are divisors of the current m (which starts as n, then becomes the last divisor found). This produces the chain of divisors: the next divisor must divide the previous divisor.\n\nExample: \n   Input to the second program: 10\n   Output:\n        10 \n        5 \n        1 \n\n   Because: \n        m=10, then i=9,8,...,5: 10%5==0 -> print 5, then m=5.\n        then i=4,3,2: none divides 5? until i=1: 5%1==0 -> print 1.\n\nBut note: 10%10==0? but we start i from n-1 (which is 9) so we skip 10. But we already printed 10.\n\nSo the algorithm of the second program:\n   - Print the starting number n (with a space and newline).\n   - Set m = n.\n   - Then for i from n-1 down to 1:\n        if m % i == 0, then print i (with space and newline) and set m = i.\n\nTherefore, the C program:\n\n   Read n0 and k0 (for the first program).\n\n   // First program logic:\n        int n = n0, k = k0;\n        int i = 1, req = 1;\n        while (k >= req) {\n            k -= req;\n            i++;\n            if (i % n0 != 0) {\n                req = i % n0;\n            } else {\n                req = n0;\n            }\n        }\n        // Now k is the remaining chips (which we call x)\n\n   Then set n_second = k;   // because the first program's output is k (remaining)\n\n   Then for the second program:\n        int m = n_second;\n        // Print the starting number: \n        printf(\"%d \\n\", n_second);   // note: we are including a space and then a newline.\n\n        for (int i_val = n_second - 1; i_val > 0; i_val--) {\n            if (m % i_val == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", i_val);\n                m = i_val;\n            }\n        }\n\nBut wait: the first program uses a variable `n` which is n0 (the initial n). We must not confuse it with the n for the second program.\n\nLet me rename:\n\n   Let initial_n = n0, and initial_k = k0.\n\n   Then we compute the remaining_k.\n\n   Then set second_n = remaining_k.\n\n   Then run the second program on second_n.\n\nHowever, note: the first program uses `n` (which is initial_n) throughout. The second program uses its own `n` (which is the output of the first).\n\nBut in the first program, the variable `n` is read at the beginning and never changed.\n\nSo the C code:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        int initial_n, initial_k;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &initial_n, &initial_k);\n\n        // First program logic\n        int i = 1, req = 1;\n        int k = initial_k;\n        while (k >= req) {\n            k -= req;\n            i++;\n            if (i % initial_n != 0) {\n                req = i % initial_n;\n            } else {\n                req = initial_n;\n            }\n        }\n        // Now k is the result of the first program (remaining chips)\n\n        int second_n = k;\n\n        // Second program logic\n        int m = second_n;\n        printf(\"%d \\n\", second_n);   // note the space\n\n        for (int i_val = second_n - 1; i_val > 0; i_val--) {\n            if (m % i_val == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", i_val);   // also with a space and then newline\n                m = i_val;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\nBut note: the first program's while condition is: while (k - req >= 0) \n   which is equivalent to while (k >= req)\n\nSo we have that.\n\nHowever, let me test the first program with a small example.\n\nExample: n0=3, k0=10.\n\n   i=1, req=1: k>=1 -> k=9, i=2 -> req = 2 (because 2%3=2)\n   i=2, req=2: k=9-2=7, i=3 -> req=3 (because 3%3=0 -> so req=3)\n   i=3, req=3: k=7-3=4, i=4 -> req=4%3=1\n   i=4, req=1: k=4-1=3, i=5 -> req=5%3=2\n   i=5, req=2: k=3-2=1, i=6 -> req=6%3=0 -> 3\n   Now k=1, req=3 -> 1<3 -> break.\n\n   Output: 1.\n\nThen the second program gets 1:\n   prints \"1 \\n\"\n   then for i_val from 0 down to 1? Actually, for i_val = 1-1 = 0; the loop condition i_val>0 fails.\n\n   So only prints \"1 \\n\"\n\nBut the original first program would output 1 (without space) and then the second program would output \"1 \\n\". \n\nBut in our C program, we only output the second program's output: \"1 \\n\". \n\nAnd if we run the two programs in a pipe, the user would only see the second program's output: \"1 \\n\". \n\nSo it matches.\n\nAnother example: n0=3, k0=11.\n\n   i=1: k=11-1=10 -> i=2, req=2\n   i=2: k=10-2=8 -> i=3, req=3\n   i=3: k=8-3=5 -> i=4, req=1\n   i=4: k=5-1=4 -> i=5, req=2\n   i=5: k=4-2=2 -> i=6, req=3 -> now k=2 < 3 -> break.\n   Output: 2.\n\nSecond program: \n   Input n=2.\n   Output: \n        \"2 \\n\"\n        then for i_val=1: 2%1==0 -> so print \"1 \\n\"\n\n   So output: \n        2 \n        1\n\nTherefore, the entire output of the chain (as seen by the user) is:\n   2 \n   1\n\nAnd our C program will output the same.\n\nBut note: the second program in the original prints a space and then a newline. So each number is printed as: \n   [number] [space] [newline]\n\nSo we are doing the same.\n\nTherefore, the C code as below.\n\nHowever, note the first program's logic: the condition in the while loop is checked again inside? \n\nOriginal Java (first program):\n   while (k - req >= 0) {\n        if (k - req >= 0) {\n            k = k - req;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n        ... \n   }\n\nThis is redundant: the condition is already checked in the while. We can remove the inner if.\n\nBut to be faithful, we can write it as:\n\n   while (k >= req) {\n        k -= req;\n        ... \n   }\n\nBecause the break is never taken inside the loop (since the while condition ensures k>=req).\n\nSo we can simplify.\n\nLet me write the entire C code accordingly.\n\nNote: We must be cautious with the variable names.\n\nFinal code:"
