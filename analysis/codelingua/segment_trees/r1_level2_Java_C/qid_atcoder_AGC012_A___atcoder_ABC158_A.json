Note: the array can have negative numbers, so we must use a proper comparison. Compare function:\n\n      int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) { int arg1 = *(const int*)a;\n          int arg2 = *(const int*)b;\n          if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n          if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      } But we can also do:\n\n      return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n\nBut note: if the difference is more than INT_MAX, this can cause overflow. So we do:\n\n      if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n      else if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n      else return 0;\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      return (arg1 > arg2) - (arg1 < arg2); But for clarity, we can write:\n\n      int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {\n          int x = *(const int *)a;\n          int y = *(const int *)b;\n          if (x < y) return -1;\n          if (x > y) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nHowever, the original Java Arrays.sort sorts in ascending order, which is the same. But note: the original Java program uses `Arrays.sort(array)`, which for an int[] sorts in ascending order (smallest first). So we are good. Let's write the entire C program accordingly. Edge: n=0? Then the array has 0 elements. Then the loop for summing runs 0 times -> sum=0. Then we check the string \"0\": no 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\". But the original first program: if n=0, then it creates an array of 0 elements? Then the for loop for reading runs 0 times. Then it sorts an empty array? Then the loop for summing runs 0 times. Then prints 0. Then the second program reads \"0\" and outputs \"No\". So same. We assume the input n is nonnegative. Code structure:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {\n      int x = *(const int *)a;\n      int y = *(const int *)b; if (x < y) return -1;\n      if (x > y) return 1;\n      return 0;\n  }\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      int total = 3 * n;\n      int *arr = (int*)malloc(total * sizeof(int));\n      for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n      }\n\n      qsort(arr, total, sizeof(int), compare_ints);\n\n      long sum = 0;\n      // Start at index = total - 2, then total-4, ... for n steps. int index = total - 2;\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          sum += arr[index];\n          index -= 2;\n      }\n\n      char buffer[25];\n      snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%ld\", sum);\n\n      int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; buffer[i]; i++) {\n          if (buffer[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n          else if (buffer[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n      } if (foundA && foundB) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      free(arr);\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `in.next()`, which would not include any newline.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (atcoder_AGC012_A):\n  - Reads an integer `n`.\n  - Reads an array of `3*n` integers.\n  - Sorts the array.\n  - Then, starting from the second last element (index = 3*n - 2), it picks every second element going backwards (so indices: 3n-2, 3n-4, ... until n times) and sums them up.\n  - Outputs the sum.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n  - Reads a string `s`.\n  - If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', it prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nHowever, note the sequence: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs a long integer (the sum) and the second program expects a string.\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input for the entire sequence: \n      First, the integer `n` and then `3*n` integers (as per the first program).\n  Then, the output of the first program (a long integer) is passed as input to the second program? \n  However, the second program reads a string.\n\nBut the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nTherefore, the output of the first program (a number) is the input string for the second program.\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would get the string \"123\".\n\nBut the second program checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. In a string that is a number, there is no 'A' or 'B'. So the second program would always output \"No\".\n\nHowever, let's read the problem: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nWe must simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O. So:\n\n  Step 1: Run the first program on the initial input (which is the integer `n` and then `3*n` integers).\n  Step 2: Capture the output of the first program as a string (without any extra spaces, just the number and then a newline? but note: the first program uses `System.out.println(res);` so it prints the number and then a newline).\n  Step 3: Use that string (without the newline? or including the newline?) as the input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program reads a string using `in.next()`. In Java, `next()` reads the next token (whitespace delimited). So the newline would be skipped? Actually, the first program prints the number and then a newline. Then the second program's `in.next()` would read the number as a string (without the newline, because `next()` skips leading whitespace and then takes non-whitespace until next whitespace).\n\nSo the string passed to the second program is the string representation of the number (without any extra characters).\n\nTherefore, the entire chain in C:\n\n  - Read the initial input: an integer `n`, then `3*n` integers.\n  - Process the first program: sort the array, then take the second largest, fourth largest, ... (in descending order) and sum them.\n  - Convert the resulting sum to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) and then use that string as input to the second program.\n  - The second program: check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it's a string of digits, it will never contain either, so the answer is always \"No\".\n\nBut wait: what if the number contains a digit 'A'? No, because we are in base 10. The digits are 0-9.\n\nHowever, note: the first program uses `long res` and then prints it. The number can be very large, but it will only contain digits.\n\nTherefore, the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nBut let's be faithful to the chain.\n\nPlan for the C program:\n\n  We are to write a single C program that does the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read the integer `n`.\n  2. Read `3*n` integers into an array.\n  3. Sort the array (in increasing order).\n  4. Starting from the second last element (index = 3*n - 2) and moving backwards by 2 each time for `n` steps, sum those elements.\n  5. Convert this sum to a string (so we have a string of digits, no sign because the numbers are positive? The input integers are positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the original Java program uses `long res` and the input integers are from `sc.nextInt()` which are signed. However, the array is sorted and we are taking the largest elements. But note: the array could have negatives? The problem doesn't forbid. We must handle as the original.)\n\n  However, the conversion to string must be done as if we printed the number. We don't want any extra formatting.\n\n  6. Then, check this string (which is the output of the first program) for containing both 'A' and 'B'. Since the string is composed of digits and possibly a minus sign (if the sum is negative), we need to check for the characters 'A' and 'B'. But note: the original second program checks for the letter 'A' and the letter 'B'. In the string representation of a long integer, we will only have digits and possibly a minus sign. So:\n\n      - If the string contains a minus sign, then we have negative numbers? But the original first program uses `long res` and then prints. The string will be the decimal representation.\n\n  7. Then, if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', print \"Yes\". Otherwise, print \"No\".\n\n  However, as reasoned, the string will never contain 'A' or 'B'. So we can simply print \"No\".\n\n  But to be safe, we will write the check.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We must do:\n\n      Step 1: Read n and the 3*n integers.\n\n      Step 2: Sort the array.\n\n      Step 3: Compute the sum by taking the elements at indices: [3*n-2, 3*n-4, ..., 3*n-2*(n-1)].\n\n      Step 4: Convert the sum to a string.\n\n      Step 5: Check the string for containing 'A' and 'B'. But note: the original second program checks for the presence of both. Since the string is a number, we know it doesn't contain either? But we must do the check as in the second program.\n\n      However, note: the second program is written for a different problem (Station and Bus) and expects a string that might be \"AAA\", \"ABA\", etc. But in our chain, the string is the output of the first program, which is a number.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n          for each character c in the string:\n              if (c == 'A') foundA = 1;\n              if (c == 'B') foundB = 1;\n\n          if (foundA && foundB) printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n          else printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n  However, note: the second program in Java uses `out.println`, so we output a line.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's output is a negative number? Then the string will have a minus sign. We must account for that.\n\nBut the original first program: the array is of `int` and the sum is stored in a `long`. The input numbers are integers (could be negative). So we must handle negative.\n\nExample: \n  n=1, array = [-1, -2, -3]. \n  Sorted: [-3, -2, -1]\n  Then we take the element at index 3*1-2 = 1 -> which is -2.\n  Then the string is \"-2\".\n\nNow, check: does \"-2\" contain 'A'? No. 'B'? No. So output \"No\".\n\nBut what if the number is very large? We can use `long` in C as well.\n\nSteps in C:\n\n  Step 1: Read integer n.\n  Step 2: Allocate an array of 3*n integers and read them.\n  Step 3: Sort the array (using qsort).\n  Step 4: Traverse from the second last element backwards every two steps for n steps and accumulate the sum in a long variable.\n  Step 5: Convert the long to a string. We can use `snprintf` to compute the required length, then allocate or use a fixed buffer? The maximum length of a long in decimal is about 20 digits (for 64-bit) plus sign. So we can use a fixed buffer of 25.\n\n  Step 6: Check the string for containing 'A' and 'B'. Note: the string does not include any newline or extra spaces.\n\n  Step 7: Print \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nBut note: the original first program uses `Arrays.sort` which sorts in ascending order. So the array is sorted from smallest to largest. Then we start at the second last (which is the second largest) and then skip one to the left (so the next is the fourth largest?).\n\nActually, the array is sorted in increasing order: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{3n-1}], so a_{3n-1} is the largest.\n\nWe take:\n  index = 3n-2 -> second largest\n  then 3n-4 -> fourth largest? Actually, the next one we take is two indices to the left? So from 3n-2, then 3n-4, then 3n-6, ... until we have taken n elements.\n\nBut note: the array has 3n elements. The indices we take: \n  i0 = 3n-2\n  i1 = 3n-4\n  ...\n  i_{n-1} = 3n-2 - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2-2n+2 = n\n\nSo the last index we take is n (which is the element at position n, the (n+1)-th element in 0-indexed).\n\nIn the sorted array, the elements we take are at indices: n, n+2, n+4, ... up to 3n-2? Actually, we are going backwards: \n  We start at 3n-2 and then subtract 2 each time for n steps.\n\nSo the indices: 3n-2, 3n-4, 3n-6, ..., until we have n numbers. The last index is 3n-2 - 2*(n-1) = n.\n\nBut note: the array is sorted in increasing order. So the element at index 3n-1 is the largest, then 3n-2 is the next, then 3n-3, then 3n-4, etc.\n\nThe elements we take: \n  index 3n-2 -> the second largest\n  index 3n-4 -> the fourth largest? Actually, the next one we take is two places to the left (which is a smaller index, meaning a smaller value). But wait: the array is sorted in increasing order, so the largest value is at the highest index.\n\n  Actually, the array is sorted: [a0, a1, ..., a_{3n-1}], with a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a_{3n-1}.\n\n  The largest element is at index (3n-1).\n  The second largest is at index (3n-2).\n  The third largest is at index (3n-3).\n  The fourth largest is at index (3n-4).\n\n  So we are taking the second, fourth, sixth, ... of the top 2n elements? Actually, we take the second largest, then skip the third largest to take the fourth largest, then skip the fifth to take the sixth, etc.\n\n  Why? Because we are stepping by 2 from the second last.\n\n  The goal of the first program: to form n groups of 3, and in each group, take the median. And then sum the medians. The optimal strategy is to sort and then take the medians as the second, fourth, ... from the top.\n\n  So the algorithm is correct.\n\nImplementation in C:\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      int total = 3 * n;\n      int *arr = (int*)malloc(total * sizeof(int));\n      for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n      }\n\n      // Sort the array in increasing order\n      qsort(arr, total, sizeof(int), compare_ints);\n\n      long sum = 0;\n      int index = total - 2; // start at the second last\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          sum += arr[index];\n          index -= 2;\n      }\n\n      // Now convert sum to a string\n      char buffer[25]; // enough for 64-bit long\n      snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%ld\", sum);\n\n      // Now check the string for containing 'A' and 'B'\n      int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; buffer[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n          if (buffer[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n          if (buffer[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n      }\n\n      if (foundA && foundB) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n  We need to define the compare_ints function for qsort.\n\n  Note: the array can have negative numbers, so we must use a proper comparison.\n\n  Compare function:\n\n      int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {\n          int arg1 = *(const int*)a;\n          int arg2 = *(const int*)b;\n          if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n          if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n      return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n\nBut note: if the difference is more than INT_MAX, this can cause overflow. So we do:\n\n      if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n      else if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n      else return 0;\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      return (arg1 > arg2) - (arg1 < arg2);\n\nBut for clarity, we can write:\n\n      int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {\n          int x = *(const int *)a;\n          int y = *(const int *)b;\n          if (x < y) return -1;\n          if (x > y) return 1;\n          return 0;\n      }\n\nHowever, the original Java Arrays.sort sorts in ascending order, which is the same.\n\nBut note: the original Java program uses `Arrays.sort(array)`, which for an int[] sorts in ascending order (smallest first).\n\nSo we are good.\n\nLet's write the entire C program accordingly.\n\nEdge: n=0? Then the array has 0 elements. Then the loop for summing runs 0 times -> sum=0. Then we check the string \"0\": no 'A' or 'B' -> output \"No\".\n\nBut the original first program: if n=0, then it creates an array of 0 elements? Then the for loop for reading runs 0 times. Then it sorts an empty array? Then the loop for summing runs 0 times. Then prints 0. Then the second program reads \"0\" and outputs \"No\". So same.\n\nWe assume the input n is nonnegative.\n\nCode structure:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {\n      int x = *(const int *)a;\n      int y = *(const int *)b;\n      if (x < y) return -1;\n      if (x > y) return 1;\n      return 0;\n  }\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      int total = 3 * n;\n      int *arr = (int*)malloc(total * sizeof(int));\n      for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n      }\n\n      qsort(arr, total, sizeof(int), compare_ints);\n\n      long sum = 0;\n      // Start at index = total - 2, then total-4, ... for n steps.\n      int index = total - 2;\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          sum += arr[index];\n          index -= 2;\n      }\n\n      char buffer[25];\n      snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%ld\", sum);\n\n      int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; buffer[i]; i++) {\n          if (buffer[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n          else if (buffer[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n      }\n\n      if (foundA && foundB) {\n          printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"No\\n\");\n      }\n\n      free(arr);\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `in.next()`, which would not include any newline. Our conversion to string does not include a newline. So the string we check is exactly the digits (and possibly minus) of the number.\n\nWe are done."
