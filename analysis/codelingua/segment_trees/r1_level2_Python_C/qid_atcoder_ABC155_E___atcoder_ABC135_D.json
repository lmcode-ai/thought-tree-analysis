But we are using nonnegative numbers. So it's safe. Let me test the second program with a small example: the string \"5\" (n2=1) is handled by the special case. Then the string \"15\" (n2=2) is not in the special case. For \"15\": \n          i=0: s2[0]=='1' -> dp[0][1]=1. i=1: s2[1]=='5' -> not wildcard.\n                for k=0..12: \n                   k=0: new_mod = (0*10+5)%13=5 -> dp[1][5] += dp[0][0]=0 -> remains 0. k=1: new_mod = (1*10+5)%13 = 15%13=2 -> dp[1][2] += dp[0][1]=1 -> dp[1][2]=1. Then output dp[1][5]=0. But the entire number 15 mod13 is (15 mod13)=2 -> so we don't count it? Then 0 is correct. Now, the string \"5\" (if we didn't have the special case) would be:\n\n            n2=1 -> then we do the loop for i=0: which sets dp[0][5]=1 -> then we output dp[0][5]=1. So the special case is the same as the general case? Then why did they break? Because the general code for i=0 is inside the loop and then we output dp[0][5]? But the Python code for the second program does:\n\n            if n==1: \n                ... and exits. Otherwise, it does the loop for i from 0 to n-1? and then outputs dp[n-1][5]. In the case n=1, the loop would run for i=0 and then output dp[0][5]. So the special case is redundant? Actually, the Python code for the second program has:\n\n            if n == 1:\n                ... and prints and exits. Then the rest of the code is for n>=2. So we do the same. Therefore, we can remove the special case? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The second program has that special case. So we must keep it.",

Let n_initial = strlen(initial_string);\n        char s1[n_initial+2]; // one for the '0' and one for the null terminator. s1[0] = '0';\n        strcpy(s1+1, initial_string);\n        Now, we have s1 = \"0\" + initial_string. Then we reverse s1?",

                                "text": "Alternatively, we can reverse the string. But note: the state machine in the first program processes the reversed string (so the least significant digit first). How did the original algorithm work? Example: \n            s = \"123\" Then s1 = \"0123\", reversed: \"3210\"\n\n          The algorithm then iterates over each character in the reversed string: first '3', then '2', then '1', then '0'. We can do:\n\n          Let len1 = n_initial + 1;\n          Then we create a reversed string? Actually, we don't need to physically reverse. We can traverse from the last character to the first. But note: the algorithm in the first program uses:\n\n            for c in s[::-1]:\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            int pmin = 0, mmin = 0;   // Actually, the initial state? In the original, the state is updated for each digit. However, the original code:\n\n            pmin = 1000\n            mmin = 0\n\n          Then for each character in the reversed string (including the added '0'):\n\n            v = int(c)\n\n            npmin = min( pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v );\n            nmmin = min( pmin + v+1, mmin + v );\n\n          Then set pmin = npmin, mmin = nmmin. Then at the end: min(pmin, mmin)\n\n        We can traverse the string s1 from the last character to the first. Steps:\n\n          pmin = 1000, mmin = 0;\n          for (int i = len1-1; i >=0; i--) {\n             int v = s1[i] - '0';\n             int npmin = min( pmin + (10 - (v+1)), mmin + (10 - v) );\n             int nmmin = min( pmin + (v+1), mmin + v );\n             pmin = npmin;\n             mmin = nmmin;\n          }\n          int res1 = min(pmin, mmin);\n\n     Step 3: Convert res1 to a string. char s2[20]; // enough for 20 digits\n          sprintf(s2, \"%d\", res1); Now, s2 is the input string for the second program. Step 4: Run the second program's DP. Let n = strlen(s2); If n==1:\n             if s2[0]=='5' -> then output 1\n             else if s2[0]=='?' -> then output 1? But wait: the second program's logic for n==1:\n\n                 if S=='5' or S=='?': then print 1? Actually:\n\n                    if n==1:\n                       if S == '5' or S == '?': \n                           print(1)   -> but if S=='?', then we have 1 way? Actually, no: the program does:\n\n                       if S == '5': then we set dp[0][5]=1 -> then output 1. if S == '?': then we set dp[0][0..9] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] = 1? because only the state 5 is counted. Actually, the output is dp[n-1][5] which for n=1 is dp[0][5]. For S='?' we set for each j: dp[0][j]=1, so dp[0][5]=1. But if S is not '5' and not '?', then if it's a digit that is not 5, then dp[0][that_digit] = 1, but then we output dp[0][5] = 0. So the code:\n\n                    if n==1:\n                       if S=='5' or S=='?': \n                           print(1)   -> actually, if S=='5', we output 1; if S=='?' we output 1? But wait, the program outputs dp[n-1][5]. For S=='5', then we set dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1. For S=='?', then we set dp[0][j]=1 for every j, so dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1. For S=='6', then we set dp[0][6]=1 -> output 0. But note: the program does:\n\n                    if S[0]!='?': then set dp[0][int(S[0])] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] -> which is 1 only if the digit is 5. So the condition in the if n==1 block is redundant? Actually, the code after the if n==1 block does the same as the general case? Why did they have a special case? They break if n==1 and then print and exit. But the general code would also work for n=1? However, the code for n=1 is the same as the general code? Actually, the code for i=0 is handled in the same loop as the others? But the if i==0 is inside the loop.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Python programs into a single C program.\n\nThe first program (File1) has two main functions: main_b and main. However, the main function that is called is `main()`, which returns a value that is printed if not None. The second program (File2) reads a string and computes a dynamic programming solution modulo 10^9+7 to count the number of ways to form numbers (with '?' as wildcards) such that the number mod 13 is 5.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. The first program (File1) reads a string (which is a number with possible digits and question marks? Actually, the first program does not have question marks. But note: the second program does). However, looking at the first program's main function:\n\n   It processes a string `s` (which is the input) and does a dynamic programming-like state update (with two states: pmin and mmin) to compute the minimum number of coins (or operations) to represent the number when you can either pay exactly or have change.\n\n   The first program's input is a string of digits (without any '?') because it uses `int(c)`. However, the second program does handle '?'.\n\n   But note: the first program is called on the input, then its output is printed. Then the second program is run independently (with its own input). However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   Therefore, the chain is:\n\n        Input (string) -> Program1 -> Output (an integer) -> Program2\n\n   However, Program2 expects a string (with possible '?') and the output of Program1 is an integer. This does not match.\n\n   Let me reexamine:\n\n   The first program (File1) has two main functions: `main_b` and `main`. The one that is called is `main()`, which returns an integer. Then that integer is printed. So the output of Program1 is the integer.\n\n   But the second program (File2) reads a string. So we must convert the integer output of Program1 to a string and then use that as input for Program2.\n\n   However, note the example: the first program is solving a problem about minimizing operations for a cash payment. The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   But the second program is solving a different problem: counting the number of ways to form a number (with wildcards) mod13=5.\n\n   This chain does not make sense. However, we are to translate the entire sequence as given.\n\n   We have two programs:\n\n      Program1: reads a string of digits (without wildcards) and outputs an integer (the result of `main()`).\n      Program2: reads a string (which can contain digits and '?') and outputs an integer (the count mod 10^9+7).\n\n   But the output of Program1 is an integer, which becomes the input to Program2. So we must convert that integer to a string for Program2.\n\n   However, the second program expects a string that might have '?' and the example input for the second program might be like \"??5\" or \"1?2\". But the integer output of Program1 is a plain integer. So the string for Program2 would be the decimal representation of that integer (without any '?')? Then the second program would count the number of ways to form that exact number? Actually, no: if there are no '?' then the count would be either 1 (if the number mod13=5) or 0.\n\n   But note: the second program does not use the integer value of the entire number? It processes the string from left to right and does DP for mod13. And if there are no '?' then it's deterministic.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input to the second program. Therefore, the second program will read a string that is the decimal digits of that integer. And that string has no '?'.\n\n   Therefore, in the second program, we can skip the wildcard handling because the input string will not contain any '?'. But we are going to write the C code exactly as the Python code, so we must handle the possibility? However, the input to the second program comes from the first program and is a string of digits (without any '?'). But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must write the second program as given, even if we know that the input has no wildcards.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the second program's input is the string representation of the integer output by the first program. Therefore, we can skip the wildcard branch? But to be safe, we write the DP as in the second program.\n\n   Steps in the combined C program:\n\n     Step 1: Read the initial input string (from stdin). This is for the first program.\n\n     Step 2: Run the first program's logic (the `main` function) on that string to compute an integer result.\n\n     Step 3: Convert that integer to a string (without any extra characters, just the decimal digits). This string becomes the input for the second program.\n\n     Step 4: Run the second program's logic (the DP for mod13 counting) on that string.\n\n     Step 5: Output the result of the second program.\n\n   However, note: the first program has two algorithms: `main_b` and `main`. But the one that is called is `main()`. We are going to implement `main()`.\n\n   The first program's `main()`:\n\n        s = input()   -> the initial string\n        Then it adds a '0' at the beginning? Actually: s = '0' + s.\n\n        Then it iterates over the reversed string (including the added '0').\n\n        We have two states: pmin and mmin.\n\n        For each digit (starting from the least significant digit) we update:\n\n          npmin = min( pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v )\n          nmmin = min( pmin + v+1, mmin + v )\n\n        Then set pmin = npmin, mmin = nmmin.\n\n        Finally, return min(pmin, mmin).\n\n   However, note: the first program has an iOS clipboard handling and other input methods. But we are to read from stdin and write to stdout. And we are only reading at the beginning and writing at the end. So we can ignore the platform specific code.\n\n   Implementation plan:\n\n     Part 1: Read the initial string from stdin.\n\n     Part 2: Prepend a '0' to that string and then reverse it (but note: the algorithm in the first program reverses the string and then processes from the least significant digit). Actually, the code: `for c in s[::-1]` so we are processing the string in reverse order. The string is the original with a '0' prepended. So the reversed string has the least significant digit first.\n\n     Part 3: Simulate the state machine for the first program and get an integer result (let it be `res1`).\n\n     Part 4: Convert `res1` to a string (using sprintf, for example). This string is the input for the second program.\n\n     Part 5: For the second program, we note that the string we just generated does not contain any '?' so we can skip the wildcard branch? But we will write the DP as in the Python code.\n\n        The second program does:\n\n          n = len(S)\n          if n==1: \n             ... (we handle that separately)\n\n          dp[0..n-1][0..12] (mod 10^9+7)\n\n          For i from 0 to n-1:\n            if i==0:\n               if S[0] != '?' -> set dp[0][digit] = 1\n               else -> for each digit 0..9: dp[0][digit] = 1\n            else:\n               if S[i] != '?':\n                 for each k in 0..12:\n                    new_index = (k * 10 + digit) % 13\n                    dp[i][new_index] += dp[i-1][k]\n               else:\n                 for each digit 0..9:\n                    for each k in 0..12:\n                       new_index = (k * 10 + digit) % 13\n                       dp[i][new_index] += dp[i-1][k]\n               Then mod each state by mod (10^9+7)\n\n          Then output dp[n-1][5]\n\n        However, note: the second program uses mod = 10**9+7, which is 1000000007? Actually, in the first program mod=1000000007, and in the second mod=10**9+7 -> same.\n\n        But the first program also uses mod=1000000007? However, the first program does not use mod in the state machine (it does integer additions and min operations). So we don't need mod for the first program.\n\n   Important: The second program in the chain must take as input the string representation of the integer output of the first program. Since that integer is the result of the first program, which is a nonnegative integer (from the problem context, it's the minimum number of coins) and the string will be the decimal representation without any leading zeros? Actually, the first program's algorithm adds a leading '0' at the beginning? But note: the input to the first program is a string without the leading zero. Then the first program adds a '0' at the beginning. The output integer is the result of the state machine.\n\n   How big can the integer be? The state machine: the state values pmin and mmin are updated by adding at most 10 per digit? And the string length is at most ... we don't know, but the problem says the original input string. We must be cautious.\n\n   However, the second program's input is the string representation of that integer. The integer might be large? The state machine in the first program: the state values are the minimal operations. The operations per digit are at most 10? Then the total operations would be at most 10 * (n+1) (n being the length of the original string). So the integer is at most 100000? Then the string length is at most 6 digits.\n\n   But wait: the state machine does not output the state value, it outputs the minimum of two states? Actually, the output is the minimal operations. The minimal operations is an integer that is the total operations. The operations per digit are at most 10 (for the worst-case digit). So the total is at most 10*(n+1). If the original string is 100000 characters, then the integer could be 10^6. That is 7 digits. So the string for the second program will be at most 7 digits.\n\n   Therefore, the second program will run on a string of length at most 7. So the DP (13 states * 7) is small.\n\n   Implementation in C:\n\n     Step 1: Read the initial string (from stdin). We assume it has no spaces and is a string of digits.\n\n        We can do: \n          char initial_string[1000000]; // big enough for the problem, but the problem doesn't specify, so we assume 1e6\n          scanf(\"%s\", initial_string);\n\n     Step 2: Prepend a '0' to the initial_string to form a new string.\n\n        Let n_initial = strlen(initial_string);\n        char s1[n_initial+2]; // one for the '0' and one for the null terminator.\n\n        s1[0] = '0';\n        strcpy(s1+1, initial_string);\n        Now, we have s1 = \"0\" + initial_string.\n\n        Then we reverse s1? Actually, the algorithm processes from the last character to the first. But we can just traverse in reverse order.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reverse the string. But note: the state machine in the first program processes the reversed string (so the least significant digit first). How did the original algorithm work?\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"123\"\n            Then s1 = \"0123\", reversed: \"3210\"\n\n          The algorithm then iterates over each character in the reversed string: first '3', then '2', then '1', then '0'.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Let len1 = n_initial + 1;\n          Then we create a reversed string? Actually, we don't need to physically reverse. We can traverse from the last character to the first.\n\n          But note: the algorithm in the first program uses:\n\n            for c in s[::-1]:\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            int pmin = 0, mmin = 0;   // Actually, the initial state? In the original, the state is updated for each digit.\n\n          However, the original code:\n\n            pmin = 1000\n            mmin = 0\n\n          Then for each character in the reversed string (including the added '0'):\n\n            v = int(c)\n\n            npmin = min( pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v );\n            nmmin = min( pmin + v+1, mmin + v );\n\n          Then set pmin = npmin, mmin = nmmin.\n\n          Then at the end: min(pmin, mmin)\n\n        We can traverse the string s1 from the last character to the first.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          pmin = 1000, mmin = 0;\n          for (int i = len1-1; i >=0; i--) {\n             int v = s1[i] - '0';\n             int npmin = min( pmin + (10 - (v+1)), mmin + (10 - v) );\n             int nmmin = min( pmin + (v+1), mmin + v );\n             pmin = npmin;\n             mmin = nmmin;\n          }\n          int res1 = min(pmin, mmin);\n\n     Step 3: Convert res1 to a string.\n\n          char s2[20]; // enough for 20 digits\n          sprintf(s2, \"%d\", res1);\n\n          Now, s2 is the input string for the second program.\n\n     Step 4: Run the second program's DP.\n\n          Let n = strlen(s2);\n          If n==1:\n             if s2[0]=='5' -> then output 1\n             else if s2[0]=='?' -> then output 1? But wait: the second program's logic for n==1:\n\n                 if S=='5' or S=='?': then print 1? Actually:\n\n                    if n==1:\n                       if S == '5' or S == '?': \n                           print(1)   -> but if S=='?', then we have 1 way? Actually, no: the program does:\n\n                       if S == '5': then we set dp[0][5]=1 -> then output 1.\n                       if S == '?': then we set dp[0][0..9] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] = 1? because only the state 5 is counted.\n\n                    Actually, the output is dp[n-1][5] which for n=1 is dp[0][5]. For S='?' we set for each j: dp[0][j]=1, so dp[0][5]=1.\n\n                    But if S is not '5' and not '?', then if it's a digit that is not 5, then dp[0][that_digit] = 1, but then we output dp[0][5] = 0.\n\n                 So the code:\n\n                    if n==1:\n                       if S=='5' or S=='?': \n                           print(1)   -> actually, if S=='5', we output 1; if S=='?' we output 1? But wait, the program outputs dp[n-1][5]. For S=='5', then we set dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1. For S=='?', then we set dp[0][j]=1 for every j, so dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1. For S=='6', then we set dp[0][6]=1 -> output 0.\n\n                 But note: the program does:\n\n                    if S[0]!='?': then set dp[0][int(S[0])] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] -> which is 1 only if the digit is 5.\n\n                 So the condition in the if n==1 block is redundant? Actually, the code after the if n==1 block does the same as the general case? Why did they have a special case? They break if n==1 and then print and exit. But the general code would also work for n=1? However, the code for n=1 is the same as the general code? Actually, the code for i=0 is handled in the same loop as the others? But the if i==0 is inside the loop.\n\n          However, since our input s2 is the string representation of an integer, it will not contain any '?'. So we can skip the wildcard branch. But we must write the code as in the Python.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            n = strlen(s2);\n            // If n==1, we can use the special case? But the Python code does:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    if S == '5' or S == '?': \n                        print(1)\n                    else:\n                        print(0)\n                    exit()\n\n            So we do the same.\n\n            Otherwise, we do the DP.\n\n          But note: the Python code for the second program does:\n\n            dp = [[0] * 13 for i in range(n)]\n\n          We can use a 2D array: dp[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 and j in 0..12.\n\n          We'll use:\n\n            long long dp[n][13];   // but n can be up to 20? so it's small.\n\n          Steps for DP:\n\n            mod = 1000000007;\n\n            for i in 0 to n-1:\n                if i==0:\n                    if s2[0] != '?') {\n                        int d = s2[0] - '0';\n                        dp[0][d] = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        for d=0 to 9: dp[0][d] = 1;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // initialize current dp[i][*] to 0\n                    for j=0 to 12: dp[i][j] = 0;\n\n                    if (s2[i] != '?') {\n                        int d = s2[i] - '0';\n                        for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                            int new_mod = (k * 10 + d) % 13;\n                            dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod;\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        for (int d=0; d<10; d++) {\n                            for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n                                int new_mod = (k * 10 + d) % 13;\n                                dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then output dp[n-1][5] % mod.\n\n          However, note: the Python code does the mod at the end of the i loop for every state? Actually, they do:\n\n            for k in range(13):\n                dp[i][k] %= mod\n\n          We are doing mod at every addition? That is safe.\n\n     Step 5: Print the result of the second program.\n\n   But note: the second program's input string s2 has no '?' because it was generated by an integer. So we can skip the wildcard branch. But we write the code as above.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Important: The first program's state machine: the initial pmin=1000 and mmin=0. Why 1000? It's a big number to represent infinity? The maximum operations per digit is 10, and the string length is at most 10^6? Then the total operations could be 10^7. But 1000 is too small? Actually, the state machine updates per digit and the states are the minimal operations for the suffix processed so far. The initial state (for the empty suffix) is set as pmin=1000 and mmin=0? That might be problematic.\n\n   However, the original Python code uses 1000. We'll do the same.\n\n   Let me test with a small example: \"1\"\n\n        s1 = \"01\" -> reversed: \"10\"\n\n        i=0: c='0' -> v=0\n            npmin = min(1000 + (10 - 1), 0 + (10 - 0)) = min(1000+9, 0+10) = min(1009, 10) = 10\n            nmmin = min(1000+1, 0+0) = min(1001,0) = 0\n            then pmin=10, mmin=0\n\n        i=1: c='1' -> v=1\n            npmin = min(10 + (10 - (1+1)=8, 0 + (10-1)=9) = min(18,9) = 9\n            nmmin = min(10 + (1+1)=12, 0+1=1) = 1\n            then min(9,1)=1 -> output 1.\n\n        This matches: we have the digit 1: we can pay 1 coin (if we use the exact coin) or get change (which would require 9 coins? but the algorithm gives 1). So 1 is correct.\n\n   Another example: \"9\"\n\n        s1 = \"09\" -> reversed: \"90\"\n\n        First digit (v=0): \n            npmin = min(1000+ (10-1)=9, 0+10)=10 -> 9\n            nmmin = min(1000+1, 0+0)=0 -> 0\n            pmin=9, mmin=0.\n\n        Second digit (v=9):\n            npmin = min(9 + (10 - (9+1)=0, 0 + (10-9)=1) = min(9,1)=1\n            nmmin = min(9 + (9+1)=19, 0+9=9) = 9\n            then min(1,9)=1.\n\n        How many coins? We have 9: we can pay with a 10-coin and get 1 change (so 1 coin) or pay with nine 1-coins (9 coins). The minimal is 1.\n\n        So 1 is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we'll code accordingly.\n\n   Summary of the C program:\n\n     #include <stdio.h>\n     #include <string.h>\n     #include <stdlib.h>\n     #include <limits.h>\n\n     #define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ?

Actually, they do:\n\n        for the non-wildcard branch: \n            dp[i][new_index] += dp[i-1][k]   -> then mod the row at the end.\n\n        for the wildcard branch: same.\n\n        then after the if-else, they do:\n\n            for k in range(13):\n                dp[i][k] %= mod\n\n   We are doing mod at every addition. This is equivalent? But to be safe, we can do the mod at the end of the row? However, the mod is 10^9+7 and the numbers can be large? The maximum in a state: at step i, the maximum value is 10^i (if we have wildcards) but our n2 is at most 20, so 10^20 is about 1e20 -> which is less than 2^67, so we can do mod at the end? But 1e20 mod 10^9+7 is not computed by accumulation? We are using long long (which is 64 bits) and 1e20 is too big for long long (max ~9e18). So we must mod at every addition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can mod at the end of the row? But the accumulation in a row might be as large as 10^i? which is 10^20 -> too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must mod at every addition.\n\n   But note: in the non-wildcard branch, we are doing:\n\n        dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod;\n\n   And in the wildcard branch similarly.\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   However, the above DP for the second program does not skip states with zero? We check `if (dp[i-1][k])` to avoid unnecessary work? But the array is small (13 states) so we can skip the condition? Let me remove the condition.\n\n   Also, note: the Python code does not skip zeros. So we can do without the condition.\n\n   Revised for the else branch (without condition):\n\n        for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {\n            int new_mod = (k * 10 + d) % 13;\n            dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod;\n        }\n\n   Similarly for the wildcard.\n\n   But the wildcard branch has two loops: we can do without condition.\n\n   So we remove the condition.\n\n   Also, note: we did initialize the entire dp array to 0? Then we can safely accumulate.\n\n   Let me update the code.\n\n   One more issue: the second program's DP: the state k is the remainder mod13 of the number formed by the prefix (without the current digit). Then the new state is (k * 10 + d) mod 13.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n   Note: We assume the input string for the first program is a string of digits (without any non-digit characters). And the integer res1 is nonnegative.\n\n   Let me test with a small example:\n\n        First program input: \"1\" -> output 1.\n\n        Then second program input: \"1\" -> n2=1 -> then we output 0? because 1 != '5'. But wait, the second program's input is the string \"1\". Then the condition: n2==1 -> if s2[0]=='5'? no, so output 0.\n\n        But the chain output is 0.\n\n        Alternatively, if the first program input is \"5\", then:\n\n            s1 = \"05\" -> reversed \"50\"\n\n            i0: v=0 -> npmin = min(1000+9, 0+10)=9, nmmin = min(1000+1,0)=0 -> pmin=9, mmin=0.\n            i1: v=5 -> npmin = min(9 + (10-6)=13, 0+ (10-5)=5) -> 5; nmmin = min(9+6=15, 0+5=5) -> 5; then res1 = min(5,5)=5.\n\n            Then the second program input is \"5\" -> n2=1 -> output 1.\n\n        So the chain output is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: The second program's DP for n>=2: we skip the n==1 case? Actually, the Python code for the second program breaks if n==1. So we do the same.\n\n   However, note: the second program's input string for the second program is the string representation of the integer. The integer might be 0? Then the string is \"0\", which has length 1. Then we use the n==1 case.\n\n   So we must handle n==1.\n\n   We write the entire code.\n\n   Also note: the first program's state machine: the state update uses (10 - (v+1)) and (10 - v). Why? The original problem is about paying with coins and getting change. We follow the algorithm.\n\n   We are ready to code.\n\n   Important: The problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we only read at the beginning and write at the end.\n\n   We assume the input string for the first program is given on stdin.\n\n   We assume the string does not exceed 1000000 characters.\n\n   We use:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <limits.h>\n\n   And define min.\n\n   We'll write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n   Let me write the code.\n\n   Note: We must use long long for the DP array? The numbers can be as large as 10^20? But we mod at every step, so they are at most 10^9+7? So we can use long long.\n\n   But the state machine for the first program uses integers that are at most 10*(len1) (which is 10^7) so int is enough (since 10^7 is about 10 million, which is within 2^31).\n\n   So for res1 we use int.\n\n   For the DP in the second program: we use long long because mod is 10^9+7 and the accumulation might be large? But the dp[i-1][k] are mod 10^9+7, so they are at most 10^9+6. Then adding 10 times that: worst-case 10*(10^9+6) which is 10^10, which fits in long long? But we do mod at every addition? Actually, we do:\n\n        dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod;\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        long long new_value = dp[i][new_mod] + dp[i-1][k];\n        dp[i][new_mod] = new_value % mod;\n\n   But note: we might have multiple additions to the same state? Then the value might be large? But the modulus will bring it down.\n\n   We'll use long long for the DP.\n\n   Code:\n\n     #include <stdio.h>\n     #include <string.h>\n     #include <stdlib.h>\n     #include <limits.h>\n\n     #define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))\n\n     const long long mod = 1000000007;\n\n     int main() {\n         // Part 1: Read the initial string\n         char initial_string[1000001]; // 10^6 + 1 for null terminator\n         if (scanf(\"%1000000s\", initial_string) != 1) {\n             // Handle error?

But we are using nonnegative numbers. So it's safe.\n\n   Let me test the second program with a small example: the string \"5\" (n2=1) is handled by the special case. Then the string \"15\" (n2=2) is not in the special case.\n\n        For \"15\": \n          i=0: s2[0]=='1' -> dp[0][1]=1.\n          i=1: s2[1]=='5' -> not wildcard.\n                for k=0..12: \n                   k=0: new_mod = (0*10+5)%13=5 -> dp[1][5] += dp[0][0]=0 -> remains 0.\n                   k=1: new_mod = (1*10+5)%13 = 15%13=2 -> dp[1][2] += dp[0][1]=1 -> dp[1][2]=1.\n                Then output dp[1][5]=0.\n\n        But the entire number 15 mod13 is (15 mod13)=2 -> so we don't count it? Then 0 is correct.\n\n        Now, the string \"5\" (if we didn't have the special case) would be:\n\n            n2=1 -> then we do the loop for i=0: which sets dp[0][5]=1 -> then we output dp[0][5]=1.\n\n        So the special case is the same as the general case? Then why did they break? Because the general code for i=0 is inside the loop and then we output dp[0][5]? But the Python code for the second program does:\n\n            if n==1: \n                ... and exits.\n\n            Otherwise, it does the loop for i from 0 to n-1? and then outputs dp[n-1][5].\n\n        In the case n=1, the loop would run for i=0 and then output dp[0][5]. So the special case is redundant? Actually, the Python code for the second program has:\n\n            if n == 1:\n                ... and prints and exits.\n\n            Then the rest of the code is for n>=2.\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n   Therefore, we can remove the special case? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The second program has that special case. So we must keep it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the input to the second program (from the first program) is a nonnegative integer string without any '?', and the integer is at least 0 and at most 10^7 (so the string length is at least 1 and at most 8). Therefore, we won't get a string of length 1 with '?'. But the special case handles the string \"5\" and \"?\".\n\n   Since our input will never have '?', the special case is equivalent to: if the string is \"5\" then output 1, else output 0? But wait: the condition is:\n\n        if s2[0]=='5' || s2[0]=='?' -> then output 1.\n\n   But our string has no '?', so it's equivalent to: if s2[0]=='5' then 1, else 0.\n\n   However, the general code for n=1 would do: dp[0][5] is 1 only if the digit is 5. So the special case is the same as the general code? Then why did they write the special case? It's redundant? But we must replicate the behavior.\n\n   We'll keep the special case.\n\n   Final code:"
