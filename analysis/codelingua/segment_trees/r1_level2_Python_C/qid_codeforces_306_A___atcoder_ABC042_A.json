But note: we have two q+1 and one q. We need two 5's. If the last one (q) is 5, then we have one 5 -> not two. If two of the numbers are 5, then either two of the first two (which are q+1) must be 5 -> so q=4 -> then the last is 4 -> then the numbers: [5,5,4] -> two 5's and one 4 -> but then the third number is 4, not 7.",

But we want exactly two? Then r must be exactly 2? Then the array: [5,5,4,4,...,4] (if m>2). Case 3: one from <r and one from >=r: then we require:\n                         q+1=5 -> q=4, and also q=5 -> impossible. Therefore, only case 1 and case 2 are possible. Case 1: q=5 and we want exactly two 5's? Then the number of 5's is (m - r). We require that to be 2 -> so m-r=2. And the first r numbers are 6. The total sum: \n                    n = r*6 + (m-r)*5 = r*6 + 2*5 = 6r+10. We require n=17? -> 6r+10=17 -> 6r=7 -> r is not integer. Case 2: q=4, r=2 -> then the array: \n                    first 2: 4+1=5, then the rest: 4. So the array has the first two as 5, and the rest (m-2) as 4. The number of 5's is 2 (exactly two) -> then we require the total sum to be 17. Total sum = 2*5 + (m-2)*4 = 10 + 4*(m-2) = 4*m + 2. We set that equal to 17: \n                    4*m + 2 = 17 -> 4*m=15 -> m=15/4 -> not integer. Therefore, it is impossible? But note: the problem does not require that we get a YES.",

So the condition (sum(ABC)==17) is equivalent to n==17. Therefore, the second program can be simplified:\n\n             if (the array has exactly two 5's) and (n==17):\n                 print('YES')\n             else:\n                 print('NO')\n\n          How to count the number of 5's without storing the entire array?

Then we add both parts -> total m. And if q==5 and q+1==5? -> then 5==4 -> impossible. So only one of the two conditions can be true. Therefore, the C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int n, m;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n                int q = n / m;\n                int r = n % m;\n\n                int count5 = 0;\n                if (q + 1 == 5) {\n                    count5 += r;\n                } if (q == 5) {\n                    count5 += (m - r);\n                }\n\n                if (count5 == 2 && n == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n          Let's test with the example that we thought would be [5,5,4] (which is when n=14, m=3: q=4, r=2 -> then first two are 5, last is 4) -> \n             q=4 -> then q+1=5 -> so count5 += r (which is 2) -> count5=2. n=14 ! = 17 -> so output 'NO'. Correct. Another example: n=17, m=3: \n             q = 17/3 = 5, r = 2 -> \n                 q+1=6 -> skip. q=5 -> count5 += (m-r)= 3-2 = 1 -> count5=1. then n=17 -> but count5 is 1 -> output 'NO'. Correct. Example: n=17, m=4: \n             q=4, r=1 -> \n                 q+1=5 -> count5 += r=1 -> count5=1. q=4 -> skip. then n=17 -> but count5=1 -> NO. How about an example that should be YES? We have to satisfy: n=17 and count5=2. We need:\n                 count5 = (if q+1==5 then r) + (if q==5 then m-r) = 2.\n\n             And n=17. So we need an integer solution to:\n                 (option1: q+1=5 -> q=4) then count5 = r = 2 -> so r=2. Then the array: first 2 elements: 5, the rest: 4 -> total = 2*5 + (m-2)*4 = 10 + 4*(m-2) = 4*m + 2. And n=17 -> 4*m+2=17 -> 4*m=15 -> m=15/4 -> not integer. (option2: q=5) then count5 = (m-r) = 2 -> so m-r=2 -> r = m-2. Then the array: first r = m-2 elements: 6, the last 2: 5 -> total = (m-2)*6 + 2*5 = 6*m -12 +10 = 6*m -2. And n=17 -> 6*m -2 =17 -> 6*m=19 -> m=19/6 -> not integer. Therefore, there is no integer m for which n=17 and count5=2. So the program will never output 'YES'. But that is the same as the original. However, note: the original second program does:\n\n             ABC = tuple(...)   # which is the entire list of m numbers\n             if ABC.count(5)==2 and sum(ABC)==17 -> YES But note: the sum(ABC) is n. So we are checking n==17. And the count of 5 is computed by the same method. Therefore, the above C program is equivalent. But wait: what if m=0? The first program: n,0 -> division by zero. In C, integer division by zero is undefined. In Python, it raises an exception. The problem says \"behaves identically\". We should avoid division by zero. The problem does not specify constraints, but the original Python program would crash for m=0. We can assume m>=1? The problem says: \"n, m = map(int, input().split())\" and then n//m and n%m. In Python, if m==0, it would crash. So we assume m>=1. However, to be safe, we note that the problem does not specify. But the original program does not handle m=0. We can do:\n\n            if (m == 0) {\n                // The original program would crash. We can crash too?",

If m==0, then it prints nothing? \n                // Then the second program reads an empty line -> ABC would be an empty tuple -> count of 5 is 0 -> prints 'NO'. But wait: in the first program:\n\n                    n, m = ... q = n//m -> ZeroDivisionError. So the first program crashes and the second program is not run. Therefore, our C program should crash for m==0. We can leave the division by zero as is. But to be more aligned, we can check for m==0 and then maybe do nothing? but the original crashes. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (m == 0) {\n                // We can avoid division and then what? The second program would not run? \n                // But the entire chain: the first program crashes so the second doesn't run.\n\n                // We can let the division by zero crash.\n\n            } So we do nothing.

For example, if q=3 and r=2, then the array: [4,4, ...] -> no 5.\n\n            However, note the array is defined by: \n                a[i] = q + (i < r ? 1 : 0)\n\n            So the values are either q or q+1. Therefore, we are safe. However, one more corner: what if q is 5 and also q+1 is 5? -> that would require 5=4 -> impossible. So we are good. But note: the second program in the original reads the entire list and counts every element. Our method counts by the two segments. Therefore, we have a proof of equivalence. We output the above C program. However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\".",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs that run in sequence.\n The first program reads two integers (n and m) and then:\n   - Computes q = n // m and r = n % m.\n   - Creates an array `a` of m elements, each initially q.\n   - Adds 1 to the first r elements.\n   - Then prints the array (space separated).\n\n The second program reads a tuple of three integers (ABC) and:\n   - Checks if there are exactly two 5's in the tuple.\n   - If so, it checks if the sum is 17 -> then prints 'YES', else 'NO'.\n   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.\n\n However, note the sequence: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs a sequence of m numbers (space separated). The second program expects three integers.\n\n How can we reconcile? Let me look at the problem again.\n\n The problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n So the output of the first program (which is a space separated list of m numbers) is the input to the second.\n\n However, the second program expects three integers. This implies that the value of m in the first program must be 3.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix m. However, the second program expects exactly three integers.\n\n Therefore, the chain only makes sense when m=3. Otherwise, the second program would fail.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n How the chain works:\n\n   Step1: Read two integers: n and m (with m>=1)\n   Step1: Output: m space separated integers (with the list a of length m)\n\n   Step2: Read a tuple of three integers? But the output of step1 has m integers.\n\n   This chain only works if m==3.\n\n But the problem does not specify that m must be 3. However, if m is not 3, the second program would not work.\n\n Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must account for the case when m != 3? \n\n However, note the second program: it expects three integers. If the first program outputs more or less than three, the second program would break.\n\n But in the problem statement, we are to translate the entire sequence. We are not to change the logic.\n\n How the original chain behaves:\n\n   Example 1: \n      Input to first program: \"10 3\"\n        Output: 4 3 3\n      Then the second program gets \"4 3 3\" -> \n          ABC = (4,3,3) -> count of 5 is 0 -> prints 'NO'\n\n   Example 2:\n      Input to first program: \"17 3\"\n        Output: 6 6 5\n      Then second program: ABC = (6,6,5) -> count of 5 is 1 -> prints 'NO'\n\n   Example 3:\n      Input to first program: \"15 3\"\n        Output: 5 5 5 -> then second program: count of 5 is 3 -> prints 'NO'\n\n   Example 4:\n      Input to first program: \"12 3\"\n        Output: 4 4 4 -> then second program: count of 5 is 0 -> prints 'NO'\n\n   How can we get a 'YES'? We need two 5's and the sum to be 17.\n\n   Example: \n        Let the three numbers be a, b, c such that two of them are 5 and the third is 7 (because 5+5+7=17).\n        How do we get two 5's and one 7 from the first program?\n\n        We need: \n            a0 = 5, a1 = 5, a2 = 7.\n\n        The first program: \n            n = 5+5+7 = 17, m=3.\n            q = 17//3 = 5, r = 2.\n            So the array: [5+1, 5+1, 5] -> [6,6,5] -> which is not [5,5,7].\n\n        Alternatively, we need to arrange: the first program adds the extra 1 to the first r elements.\n\n        We want: \n            [5,5,7] -> but 5,5,7: \n            We have base q = (5+5+7) // 3 = 17//3 = 5, r=2.\n            Then we add 1 to the first two: [5+1, 5+1, 5] = [6,6,5] -> not [5,5,7].\n\n        How about [5,7,5]? \n            Then the first two: [5+1, 7, 5] -> [6,7,5] -> not.\n\n        How about [7,5,5]?\n            Then: [7+1, 5+1, 5] = [8,6,5] -> not.\n\n        So we cannot get two 5's and one 7? \n\n        Actually, the first program distributes the remainder as ones in the beginning. So the numbers are as close as possible with the first ones being larger.\n\n        Therefore, the only way to have two 5's is if the total n is 15 (which gives [5,5,5]) or ...?\n\n        But wait: what if n=16? \n            Then: [6,5,5] -> because 16//3=5, remainder 1 -> so first element gets +1 -> [6,5,5]. \n            Then the second program: (6,5,5): \n                count of 5 is 2 -> and sum is 16 -> so it would print 'NO' (because 16 != 17).\n\n        How about n=17? [6,6,5] -> count of 5: 1 -> NO.\n\n        How about n=18? [6,6,6] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=14? \n            14//3=4, r=2 -> [5,5,4] -> count of 5: 2 -> and sum=14 -> NO.\n\n        How about n=13? [5,4,4] -> count of 5: 1 -> NO.\n\n        How about n=12? [4,4,4] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=11? [4,4,3] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=10? [4,3,3] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=9? [3,3,3] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=8? [3,3,2] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=7? [3,2,2] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=6? [2,2,2] -> NO.\n\n        How about n=5? \n            5//3=1, r=2 -> [2,2,1] -> NO.\n\n        So we see that the chain for m=3 never produces two 5's and a 7? \n\n        But wait: the second program does not require the numbers to be in a particular order? \n          It counts the number of 5's. \n\n        How can we get two 5's? \n          We need at least two numbers to be 5. \n\n          Let the three numbers be: a, b, c.\n          a = q + (1 if index<r else 0)\n          b = q + (1 if index<r else 0)\n          c = q + (1 if index<r else 0)\n\n          We have two cases: \n            Case 1: r=0 -> then all are q. Then we need two 5's: so two of them must be 5, but then the third must be 5? so all 5 -> then three 5's.\n            Case 2: r=1 -> then the first one is q+1, the others are q. We need two 5's: \n                Then we must have q=5 for the last two -> so the numbers: [q+1, 5, 5] = [6,5,5]. Then we have two 5's. The sum is 6+5+5=16 -> not 17.\n            Case 3: r=2 -> then the first two are q+1, the last is q. We need two 5's: \n                Possibilities:\n                  - The two that are q+1 are 5? then q=4 -> then the last is 4. So the numbers: [5,5,4] -> sum=14 -> not 17.\n                  - One of the q+1 and the last one (q) is 5? \n                      If the last one is 5, then q=5 -> then the first two are 6. Then we have [6,6,5] -> two 5's? no, only one 5.\n                  - Alternatively, one of the q+1 is 5? then q=4 -> then the other q+1 is 5? -> same as above: [5,5,4]. \n                But note: we have two q+1 and one q. We need two 5's. \n                  If the last one (q) is 5, then we have one 5 -> not two.\n                  If two of the numbers are 5, then either two of the first two (which are q+1) must be 5 -> so q=4 -> then the last is 4 -> then the numbers: [5,5,4] -> two 5's and one 4 -> but then the third number is 4, not 7.\n\n          Therefore, it is impossible to get two 5's and one 7? \n\n        But note: the second program does not require the third number to be 7? It requires the sum to be 17. \n          With two 5's, the third number must be 7 (since 5+5+7=17). \n\n        So we need the array to be [5,5,7] or [5,7,5] or [7,5,5]. \n\n        However, the first program produces an array that is non-increasing? Actually, the first r elements are q+1 and the rest q. So the array is non-increasing? \n\n        But note: the example above: \n          n=16, m=3 -> [6,5,5] -> which is non-increasing? \n\n        The condition: we need two 5's and one 7. The only non-increasing permutations of [5,5,7] are [7,5,5]. \n\n        So we require: \n            a0 = 7, a1=5, a2=5.\n\n        How do we get that? \n            a0 = q + 1 (if r>=1) \n            a1 = q + 1 (if r>=2) \n            a2 = q.\n\n        But we want a0=7, a1=5, a2=5 -> then we must have:\n            a2 = q = 5 -> so q=5.\n            a1 = q + (1 if r>=2) = 5 + (1 if r>=2) -> we want this to be 5 -> so we must not add 1 to the second? -> so r must be less than 2 -> but then a0 would be 5 (if r=0) or 6 (if r=1) -> not 7.\n\n        Alternatively, if we want a0=7: \n            a0 = q + (1 if 0<r) = q+1 -> so q+1=7 -> q=6.\n            Then a1 = 6 + (1 if 1<r) -> we want a1=5 -> but 6+ (if r>=2 then 1) -> that would be at least 6 -> cannot be 5.\n\n        Therefore, the first program cannot produce [7,5,5]? \n\n        So the chain will never output 'YES'? \n\n        But note: the problem does not say the chain is useful. We are just translating.\n\n        Therefore, we must write a C program that:\n\n          Step 1: reads two integers: n and m.\n          Step 2: computes an array a of m integers: \n                  q = n / m (integer division), r = n % m.\n                  for i from 0 to m-1: \n                      a[i] = q + (1 if i < r else 0)\n\n          Step 3: Now, instead of printing, we pass this array to the next step.\n\n          But the next step (the second program) expects to read three integers. However, note the chain: the output of the first program is printed as space separated numbers. Then the second program reads from standard input. \n\n          In the chain, the entire output of the first program is the input to the second. \n\n          How do we do without I/O in the middle? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\"\n            \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n            \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\"\n\n          So we are to simulate the entire chain in one C program without printing the intermediate array.\n\n          But note: the second program expects to read three integers. However, the intermediate array has m integers. \n\n          The chain only makes sense if m==3? Otherwise, the second program would not work? \n\n          How did the original chain work for arbitrary m? \n\n          Actually, the second program would break if m != 3 because it expects exactly three integers. \n\n          But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the first program outputs m numbers (with m != 3) and the second program reads only three, then the behavior of the second program is undefined? \n\n          However, in the original Python chain, the second program would read exactly three integers? How? \n\n          The first program outputs m numbers (space separated). The second program does:\n\n            ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          This will read a line and split it into tokens and take the first three? No, it will read a whole line and split by space and then take all the tokens. \n\n          But the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program reads exactly m tokens? \n\n          Then the second program: \n             if ABC.count(5) == 2 and sum(ABC)==17 -> YES\n             else -> NO\n\n          But note: the second program expects exactly three integers? Actually, no: it reads the entire line and splits, and then the tuple can be of any length? \n\n          However, the condition: \n             if ABC.count(5) == 2: \n\n          This counts the number of 5's in the entire tuple (which has m elements). And then checks the sum.\n\n          So the second program actually works for any m? \n\n          Example: \n             Input to first program: \"10 2\" \n                 n=10, m=2 -> q=5, r=0 -> array: [5,5] \n                 Output: \"5 5\"\n\n             Then the second program: \n                 ABC = (5,5) -> \n                 count of 5: 2 -> then check sum: 10 -> not 17 -> prints 'NO'\n\n          Example: \n             Input to first program: \"17 2\"\n                 q=8, r=1 -> [9,8] -> output \"9 8\"\n                 second program: (9,8) -> count of 5:0 -> NO.\n\n          Example to get YES: \n             We need exactly two 5's and the total sum to be 17.\n\n             The entire tuple must have exactly two 5's and the rest can be any numbers, but the total must be 17.\n\n             How about: \n                 n=17, m=4: \n                    q=4, r=1 -> [5,4,4,4] -> then the tuple: (5,4,4,4)\n                    count of 5: 1 -> NO.\n\n             How about n=17, m=5:\n                    q=3, r=2 -> [4,4,3,3,3] -> count of 5:0 -> NO.\n\n             How about n=17, m=1:\n                    [17] -> count of 5:0 -> NO.\n\n             How about n=17, m=17:\n                    [1,1,...,1] (17 ones) -> count of 5:0 -> NO.\n\n             How about m=4 and we want two 5's and the rest two numbers adding up to 7? \n                 The array: [5,5,?1,?2] -> and 5+5+?1+?2=17 -> so ?1+?2=7.\n\n                 The first program: \n                    n=17, m=4 -> q=4, r=1 -> [5,4,4,4] -> which doesn't have two 5's.\n\n             How about m=5 and we want two 5's and the rest three numbers adding up to 7? \n                 The array: [5,5,?1,?2,?3] -> 5+5+?1+?2+?3=17 -> ?1+?2+?3=7.\n\n                 The first program: \n                    n=17, m=5 -> q=3, r=2 -> [4,4,3,3,3] -> no 5.\n\n          How can we get two 5's? \n             We need at two indices i to have a[i]=5.\n\n             a[i] = q + (1 if i<r else 0)\n\n             For an index i < r: a[i] = q+1.\n             For an index i>=r: a[i] = q.\n\n             We need two numbers to be 5. So either:\n                 Case 1: two indices with i>=r: then q=5 -> then all indices>=r are 5. But then we have at least m-r numbers that are 5. We want exactly two? \n                         and the indices <r are q+1=6.\n\n                 Case 2: two indices with i<r: then q+1=5 -> so q=4 -> then for indices <r: we have 5, and for indices>=r: we have 4.\n                         Then the two 5's come from the first r (which are at least two). But we want exactly two? Then r must be exactly 2? \n                         Then the array: [5,5,4,4,...,4] (if m>2). \n\n                 Case 3: one from <r and one from >=r: then we require:\n                         q+1=5 -> q=4, and also q=5 -> impossible.\n\n             Therefore, only case 1 and case 2 are possible.\n\n             Case 1: q=5 and we want exactly two 5's? \n                 Then the number of 5's is (m - r). We require that to be 2 -> so m-r=2.\n                 And the first r numbers are 6.\n\n                 The total sum: \n                    n = r*6 + (m-r)*5 = r*6 + 2*5 = 6r+10.\n\n                 We require n=17? -> 6r+10=17 -> 6r=7 -> r is not integer.\n\n             Case 2: q=4, r=2 -> then the array: \n                    first 2: 4+1=5, then the rest: 4.\n                    So the array has the first two as 5, and the rest (m-2) as 4.\n\n                 The number of 5's is 2 (exactly two) -> then we require the total sum to be 17.\n\n                 Total sum = 2*5 + (m-2)*4 = 10 + 4*(m-2) = 4*m + 2.\n\n                 We set that equal to 17: \n                    4*m + 2 = 17 -> 4*m=15 -> m=15/4 -> not integer.\n\n             Therefore, it is impossible? \n\n          But note: the problem does not require that we get a YES. It requires that we replicate the behavior.\n\n          So the C program must:\n\n            Step 1: Read two integers: n and m.\n            Step 2: Allocate an array of m integers? Or we can just compute the entire array? \n            Step 3: But note: the second program uses the entire array (of m integers). \n\n          How the second program works for arbitrary m? \n            It counts the number of 5's in the entire array and checks if that count is exactly 2 and the total sum is 17.\n\n          However, note: the total sum of the array is n (because the array is the distribution of n into m parts). \n            So the second program checks: \n               if (the array has exactly two 5's) and (n == 17) -> then output 'YES'\n               else: output 'NO'\n\n          But wait: the array has total sum n. So the condition (sum(ABC)==17) is equivalent to n==17.\n\n          Therefore, the second program can be simplified:\n\n             if (the array has exactly two 5's) and (n==17):\n                 print('YES')\n             else:\n                 print('NO')\n\n          How to count the number of 5's without storing the entire array? \n\n          We know the array: \n             The array has:\n                 the first r elements: q+1\n                 the next (m-r) elements: q\n\n          So the number of 5's:\n\n             count = 0\n             if q+1 == 5, then the first r elements are 5 -> count += r\n             if q == 5, then the next (m-r) elements are 5 -> count += (m-r)\n\n          Therefore, the entire chain can be computed without storing the array.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and m.\n            Step 2: \n                 q = n / m;   // integer division\n                 r = n % m;\n\n            Step 3: Count the number of 5's:\n                 count5 = 0;\n                 if (q+1 == 5) {\n                     count5 += r;\n                 }\n                 if (q == 5) {\n                     count5 += (m - r);\n                 }\n\n            Step 4: \n                 if (count5 == 2 && n == 17) {\n                     printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                 } else {\n                     printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                 }\n\n          But wait: what if both q and q+1 are 5? Then we add both parts -> total m. \n          And if q==5 and q+1==5? -> then 5==4 -> impossible.\n\n          So only one of the two conditions can be true.\n\n          Therefore, the C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int n, m;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n                int q = n / m;\n                int r = n % m;\n\n                int count5 = 0;\n                if (q + 1 == 5) {\n                    count5 += r;\n                }\n                if (q == 5) {\n                    count5 += (m - r);\n                }\n\n                if (count5 == 2 && n == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n          Let's test with the example that we thought would be [5,5,4] (which is when n=14, m=3: q=4, r=2 -> then first two are 5, last is 4) -> \n             q=4 -> then q+1=5 -> so count5 += r (which is 2) -> count5=2.\n             n=14 != 17 -> so output 'NO'. Correct.\n\n          Another example: n=17, m=3: \n             q = 17/3 = 5, r = 2 -> \n                 q+1=6 -> skip.\n                 q=5 -> count5 += (m-r)= 3-2 = 1 -> count5=1.\n             then n=17 -> but count5 is 1 -> output 'NO'. Correct.\n\n          Example: n=17, m=4: \n             q=4, r=1 -> \n                 q+1=5 -> count5 += r=1 -> count5=1.\n                 q=4 -> skip.\n             then n=17 -> but count5=1 -> NO.\n\n          How about an example that should be YES? \n             We have to satisfy: n=17 and count5=2.\n\n             We need:\n                 count5 = (if q+1==5 then r) + (if q==5 then m-r) = 2.\n\n             And n=17.\n\n             So we need an integer solution to:\n                 (option1: q+1=5 -> q=4) then count5 = r = 2 -> so r=2.\n                 Then the array: first 2 elements: 5, the rest: 4 -> total = 2*5 + (m-2)*4 = 10 + 4*(m-2) = 4*m + 2.\n                 And n=17 -> 4*m+2=17 -> 4*m=15 -> m=15/4 -> not integer.\n\n             (option2: q=5) then count5 = (m-r) = 2 -> so m-r=2 -> r = m-2.\n                 Then the array: first r = m-2 elements: 6, the last 2: 5 -> total = (m-2)*6 + 2*5 = 6*m -12 +10 = 6*m -2.\n                 And n=17 -> 6*m -2 =17 -> 6*m=19 -> m=19/6 -> not integer.\n\n             Therefore, there is no integer m for which n=17 and count5=2.\n\n          So the program will never output 'YES'. But that is the same as the original.\n\n          However, note: the original second program does:\n\n             ABC = tuple(...)   # which is the entire list of m numbers\n             if ABC.count(5)==2 and sum(ABC)==17 -> YES\n\n          But note: the sum(ABC) is n. So we are checking n==17.\n\n          And the count of 5 is computed by the same method.\n\n          Therefore, the above C program is equivalent.\n\n          But wait: what if m=0? \n             The first program: n,0 -> division by zero.\n\n          In C, integer division by zero is undefined. In Python, it raises an exception.\n\n          The problem says \"behaves identically\". We should avoid division by zero.\n\n          The problem does not specify constraints, but the original Python program would crash for m=0.\n\n          We can assume m>=1? The problem says: \"n, m = map(int, input().split())\" and then n//m and n%m. In Python, if m==0, it would crash.\n\n          So we assume m>=1.\n\n          However, to be safe, we note that the problem does not specify. But the original program does not handle m=0.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            if (m == 0) {\n                // The original program would crash. We can crash too? or we can avoid division.\n                // But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we can crash.\n\n                // However, the problem says: the first program prints m numbers. If m==0, then it prints nothing? \n                // Then the second program reads an empty line -> ABC would be an empty tuple -> count of 5 is 0 -> prints 'NO'.\n\n                But wait: in the first program:\n\n                    n, m = ... \n                    q = n//m -> ZeroDivisionError.\n\n                So the first program crashes and the second program is not run.\n\n                Therefore, our C program should crash for m==0.\n\n          We can leave the division by zero as is.\n\n          But to be more aligned, we can check for m==0 and then maybe do nothing? but the original crashes.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (m == 0) {\n                // We can avoid division and then what? The second program would not run? \n                // But the entire chain: the first program crashes so the second doesn't run.\n\n                // We can let the division by zero crash.\n\n            }\n\n          So we do nothing.\n\n          Therefore, the final C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                int n, m;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n                int q = n / m;   // if m==0, this will crash -> as in Python.\n                int r = n % m;\n\n                int count5 = 0;\n                if (q + 1 == 5) {\n                    count5 += r;\n                }\n                if (q == 5) {\n                    count5 += (m - r);\n                }\n\n                if (count5 == 2 && n == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n          But wait: what if the array has numbers that are 5 but not by being either q or q+1? \n            For example, if q=3 and r=2, then the array: [4,4, ...] -> no 5.\n\n            However, note the array is defined by: \n                a[i] = q + (i < r ? 1 : 0)\n\n            So the values are either q or q+1.\n\n          Therefore, we are safe.\n\n          However, one more corner: what if q is 5 and also q+1 is 5? -> that would require 5=4 -> impossible.\n\n          So we are good.\n\n          But note: the second program in the original reads the entire list and counts every element. Our method counts by the two segments. \n\n          Therefore, we have a proof of equivalence.\n\n          We output the above C program.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". And we have done so without storing the array. \n\n          But note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\", and we haven't.\n\n          We only read n and m at the beginning and print either \"YES\" or \"NO\" at the end.\n\n          Therefore, we are done.\n\n          But wait: what if the first program had a loop that printed the array? We are skipping that. But we are required to avoid I/O in the middle.\n\n          And we have computed the same result as the entire chain.\n\n          So this is acceptable.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" -> we produce one output at the end.\n\n          And the first block reads the input.\n\n          Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n          Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"10 3\"\n                n=10, m=3 -> q=3, r=1 -> \n                    q+1=4 -> not 5 -> skip.\n                    q=3 -> not 5 -> skip -> count5=0 -> then n!=17 -> output 'NO'. \n                The original: \n                    first program: [4,3,3] -> then second program: (4,3,3) -> count of 5 is 0 -> 'NO'. -> matches.\n\n            Example 2: \"17 3\"\n                n=17, m=3 -> q=5, r=2 -> \n                    q+1=6 -> skip.\n                    q=5 -> count5 += (3-2)=1 -> count5=1 -> then n==17 but count5!=2 -> output 'NO'.\n                The original: [6,6,5] -> count of 5:1 -> 'NO'. -> matches.\n\n          We are confident.\n\n          Code:"
