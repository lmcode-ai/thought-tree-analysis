The gcd function above: when b=0, we return a. So gcd(360,0)=360? Then n=360/360=1. Also, if x=0, then gcd(360,0)=360, then n=1. Therefore, it's safe. However, the input x? We read with %d, so it's integer. But the problem does not specify the range. But note: the gcd function: if x=0, then gcd(360,0)=360. Then n=1.\n\n  Also, if x is negative, we take absolute value.

We break at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. And then we output accordingly. This program will always output \"NO\", but it does the same steps. Let me test with n=1: string \"1\", then last_char='1'. Then check: strchr(vo, '1') returns NULL -> so print \"NO\". With n=10: last_char='0' -> \"NO\". With n=12: last_char='2' -> \"NO\". Therefore, we have the same behavior. But note: what if the string representation of n had a vowel? For example, if n was 10 and we had a different representation? It's always digits.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Python programs into one C program.\n\nFirst Python program (File 1):\n  Reads an integer `x`.\n  Computes: 360 // gcd(360, x)\n\nSecond Python program (File 2):\n  Reads a string `a` (which in the chain will be the output of the first program, but note: the first program outputs an integer and the second expects a string? Actually, the second program expects a string that might be the integer as a string? However, the chain is such that the output of the first becomes the input of the second. But the first outputs an integer and the second expects a string? Let me clarify the chain:\n\n  The first program reads an integer, then prints an integer (without any space, just the number and then a newline?).\n  The second program reads a string (which would be that integer as a string, including the newline?).\n\n  However, note the second program: it iterates backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark character. Then it checks if that character is a vowel. But the input to the second program is a number (as a string) and then a newline? So the last non-space character in that string would be the last digit of the number (unless the number has multiple digits) and then there might be a newline. But note: the second program skips spaces and question marks. The input string for the second program will be something like \"360\\n\" (if the first output was 360). \n\n  The second program goes from the end backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark. It will skip the newline? Actually, the `input()` in Python for the second program would read the entire line, including the newline? Actually, `input()` in Python strips the trailing newline. But note: when we run the chain, the output of the first program is a string that ends with a newline. However, the second program's `input()` function returns the line without the trailing newline. So the string `a` in the second program does not have the newline.\n\n  Therefore, the string in the second program is the digits of the number (without any trailing space or newline). So the last character is the last digit of the number.\n\n  The second program then checks if that last digit is a vowel? But vowels are letters, and digits are not letters. So it will always break on a digit and that digit is not in `vo` (which contains only vowels). Therefore, it will print \"NO\".\n\n  However, wait: what if the number is printed as a string and the last character is a digit? Then the condition `if (a[i] in vo)` will be false. So it will print \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the first program outputs an integer and then a newline. The second program's `input()` reads a line and strips the newline. So the string `a` is the digits of the number. The last character of the string is the last digit. Since digits are not vowels, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\n  However, let me check the example: if the first program outputs \"360\", then the second program gets the string \"360\". It iterates backwards: \n    i = 2: character '0' -> not space or '?', so check: is '0' in vo? No -> print \"NO\" and break.\n\n  But wait: what if the number has only one digit? Then the same applies.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain: \n    Input: an integer x.\n    Output: \"NO\"\n\n  But that doesn't make sense because the original chain would output \"NO\" regardless? \n\n  However, let me run the chain with an example:\n\n  Example 1: \n    Input to first program: 90\n    gcd(360,90)=90 -> 360//90=4 -> outputs \"4\\n\"\n    Second program: a = \"4\" (without the newline because input() strips it)\n    Then it checks the last character: '4' -> not vowel -> prints \"NO\"\n\n  Example 2:\n    Input: 1 -> gcd(360,1)=1 -> 360//1=360 -> outputs \"360\"\n    Then second program: last character is '0' -> prints \"NO\"\n\n  So the entire chain always outputs \"NO\"?\n\n  But wait, what if the first program outputs a number that ends with a vowel? For example, if the number ends with 'a'? But the number is an integer and when printed it only has digits. So the last character will always be a digit. Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\n  However, let me check the problem: the second program is designed to look at the last non-space and non-question mark character. In the string we are providing (the number) there are no spaces or question marks? So it will look at the last digit.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain: \n    Read an integer x, compute n = 360 // gcd(360, x) (which is an integer), then output \"NO\".\n\n  But that seems too trivial? However, that is what the chain does.\n\n  But note: the second program might break on the last non-space and non-question mark, but the string we pass is just digits and no spaces? So it will break on the last digit.\n\n  However, what if the first program outputs a number that has a space in it? In Python, when we print an integer, we don't put spaces. So the output of the first program is a string of digits and then a newline.\n\n  The second program's `input()` will take the entire line and strip the newline, so we have a string of digits.\n\n  Therefore, the chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n  So we can write a C program that:\n    - Reads an integer x.\n    - Computes n = 360 / gcd(360, x)  [using integer division, which is the same as in Python]\n    - Then, because the second program always outputs \"NO\", we can simply output \"NO\".\n\n  However, note: the second program might have multiple outputs? Actually, it breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark. So it outputs exactly one line: either \"YES\" or \"NO\". In our case, it's always \"NO\".\n\n  But wait: what if the number is negative? The first program: input() in Python for an integer can handle negative? But the gcd in Python works for non-negative? Actually, the gcd function in Python's math module works for nonnegative? But note: the input x is positive? The problem does not specify, but the gcd function in the original program: gcd(360, x) - 360 is positive, and gcd is defined for integers. The math.gcd in Python returns the non-negative gcd. And then 360//gcd is an integer.\n\n  However, the input x is read as an integer. The problem does not specify constraints, but we assume positive? Actually, the example uses positive.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the same behavior\". So we must mimic the chain. \n\n  Alternative approach: we can simulate the entire chain.\n\n  Steps for the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read an integer x.\n\n  Step 2: Compute g = gcd(360, x) [taking absolute values? because gcd should be positive]. Then n = 360 / g. (integer division)\n\n  Step 3: Now, the second program: we are given the string of the integer n? Actually, the second program reads a string. But we don't need to convert n to a string? Because we know the last character of the string representation of n? \n\n  However, the second program does:\n      for i from len(a)-1 down to 0:\n          if a[i] is space or '?', skip.\n          else: check if that character is a vowel -> then output \"YES\" and break, or \"NO\" and break.\n\n  Since the string representation of n contains only digits (and if n is negative, then there would be a minus sign? But note: n = 360//gcd(360,x) is always positive? Because 360 is positive and gcd is positive. So n is positive. Therefore, the string has no minus sign, only digits.\n\n  Therefore, the last non-space and non-question mark character is the last digit of n. And since it's a digit, it is not a vowel. So we can simply output \"NO\".\n\n  But wait: what if the number has trailing spaces? It doesn't. The output of the first program is just the integer and a newline.\n\n  However, to be faithful, we could simulate the second program without actually building the string? We can note that the string representation of n has no spaces and no question marks, so we just need to check the last digit? But the second program checks from the end until it finds a non-space and non-question mark. Since there are none, it will take the last character (which is the last digit). And we know that last digit is a digit, not a vowel.\n\n  Therefore, we can avoid converting n to a string and just output \"NO\".\n\n  But what if the first program outputs a number that ends with a digit that is also a letter? For example, in hexadecimal? No, it's decimal and digits are 0-9.\n\n  So the entire program:\n\n      Read integer x.\n      Compute g = gcd(360, abs(x))? Actually, gcd(360, x) is the same as gcd(360, |x|) because gcd is defined for nonnegative and the gcd of 360 and a negative is the same as the gcd of 360 and the absolute value. But the Python math.gcd returns nonnegative and works for negative by taking absolute values? Yes, according to the documentation.\n\n      Then n = 360 / g.\n\n      Then we know that the second program would output \"NO\", so we print \"NO\".\n\n  However, let me check: what if the first program outputs a number that has a vowel in its string representation? For example, if n is 11? The string is \"11\", the last character is '1', which is not a vowel. So it's safe.\n\n  But what if the first program outputs 10? The last character is '0'. Still not a vowel.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <math.h>   // but note: gcd is not in math.h in C? We have to write our own.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use Euclid's algorithm.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          // we want nonnegative gcd for positive a and b? But a=360 is positive.\n          a = abs(a);\n          b = abs(b);\n          if (b == 0) return a;\n          return gcd(b, a % b);\n      }\n\n  However, we can do iterative.\n\n  But note: the input x can be negative? The problem does not specify. The original Python program: \n        x = int(input())\n        gcd(360, x) -> math.gcd works for negative? Actually, the math.gcd in Python returns the nonnegative gcd regardless of the sign.\n\n  So we take absolute values?\n\n  Actually, the gcd of 360 and x is the same as gcd(360, |x|). So we can take absolute value of x? But 360 is positive.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute the gcd without converting to absolute value by ensuring we use positive in the algorithm? The modulus operation for negative numbers in C: \n        a % b is the remainder with the same sign as the dividend? It can be negative.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            a = abs(a);\n            b = abs(b);\n            while (b) {\n                int temp = b;\n                b = a % b;\n                a = temp;\n            }\n            return a;\n        }\n\n  Then the main:\n\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        int g = gcd(360, x);\n        int n = 360 / g;   // since 360 is divisible by g? Because g is a divisor of 360? Yes, because g divides 360 (and also x). So 360/g is integer.\n\n        // Now, we don't need n for the output? Because the second program always outputs \"NO\", so:\n        printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n  But wait: is that always the case? What if the string representation of n has a vowel? We concluded it doesn't because it's all digits.\n\n  However, what if the first program outputs a number that has a trailing 'e'? For example, if the number is very large? But note: n = 360 / gcd(360, x). Since gcd(360, x) is at least 1 and at most 360, n is between 1 and 360. So we have a small integer, represented in base 10 without exponent. So the string is just digits.\n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are not actually building the string and then processing it as the second program. However, we have deduced that the second program would always output \"NO\". \n\n  Alternatively, to be 100% faithful, we can convert the integer n to a string and then simulate the second program on that string? \n\n  Since n is between 1 and 360, we know the string length is at most 3 (or 4? 360 is 3 digits). So we can do:\n\n        char s[5]; // enough for 3 digits and the null terminator\n        snprintf(s, 5, \"%d\", n);\n\n        Then we traverse the string backwards until we find a non-space and non-question mark? But note: the string we built does not have any space or question mark. So we can just take the last character (ignoring the null terminator).\n\n        However, the original second program does:\n\n            for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n                if a[i]==' ' or a[i]=='?': continue\n                else: \n                    if a[i] in vo: then print \"YES\" and break\n                    else: print \"NO\" and break\n\n        Since there are no spaces or question marks, we will break at the last character.\n\n        Then we check: is that last character one of the vowels? We have a string of digits, so the last character is a digit. Therefore, we can just check: if the last character is in the set of vowels? It isn't, so we output \"NO\".\n\n        But to be faithful, we can code that.\n\n  However, the problem says: without I/O in the intermediate steps. And we are allowed to only have the first block read input and the last block produce output. But the intermediate steps (like converting n to a string) are allowed? They are not I/O.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"without I/O\", meaning no reading or writing to stdin/stdout. We can do internal processing.\n\n  So two options:\n\n      Option 1: Deduce that the output is always \"NO\", so just output \"NO\".\n      Option 2: Simulate the second program on the string representation of n.\n\n  Option 2 is more general and would work even if the first program output had vowels? But in this case it doesn't. But for correctness and to mimic the exact behavior (if the first program output had a vowel in the string representation, then we output \"YES\"), but in this problem it never happens? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if we use Option 1, we are relying on the fact that the first program's output is always a string of digits. But what if the first program is changed? The problem says we are given this set of programs. So for this set, the first program outputs a positive integer (as a string of digits) and then a newline. And the second program then outputs \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the chain is fixed. So we can rely on the fact that the first program outputs a string of digits.\n\n  However, to be safe and general, we might simulate the second program.\n\n  Let me write the steps:\n\n      Step 1: Read integer x.\n      Step 2: Compute n = 360 / gcd(360, abs(x))? Actually, we compute gcd(360, abs(x)) to avoid negative, but the original Python math.gcd takes absolute values.\n\n      Step 3: Convert n to a string (without the newline, just the digits).\n\n      Step 4: Traverse the string backwards until we find a character that is not space and not '?'. Since there are none, we will take the last character.\n\n      Step 5: Check if that character is one of the vowels (which are letters). Since it is a digit, it's not. Then output \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the original second program also skips the newline? But we are not including the newline in our string? Because the first program in Python outputs the number and a newline, but the second program's input() strips the newline. So we are only storing the digits.\n\n  Therefore, we can simulate without including the newline.\n\n  Steps in C:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <ctype.h>\n\n      // Function to compute gcd\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          a = abs(a);\n          b = abs(b);\n          while (b) {\n              int temp = b;\n              b = a % b;\n              a = temp;\n          }\n          return a;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          int g = gcd(360, x);\n          int n = 360 / g;\n\n          // Convert n to string\n          char s[10]; // 360 is 3 digits, so 10 is safe\n          snprintf(s, 10, \"%d\", n);\n\n          // Now, traverse the string backwards\n          int len = strlen(s);\n          int i;\n          char last_char = 0;\n          for (i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n              if (s[i] == ' ' || s[i] == '?') {\n                  continue;\n              } else {\n                  last_char = s[i];\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // If we broke because we found a non-space and non-question mark, then we have last_char set.\n          // If the entire string was space or '?', then we wouldn't set last_char? But the string is digits so we break at the last digit.\n\n          // Now, check if last_char is in the set of vowels?\n          // The vowels: 'a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y'\n          // But note: last_char is a digit, so it's not a vowel -> output \"NO\"\n\n          // However, we should check.\n          if (last_char) {\n              char vo[] = \"aeiouyAEIOUY\";\n              if (strchr(vo, last_char) != NULL) {\n                  printf(\"YES\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n              }\n          } else {\n              // This should not happen because n is at least 1, so the string has at least one digit.\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the original second program breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. We are doing the same.\n\n  However, we can optimize: since we know the string is all digits and no space or '?', we can break at the first character we look at (the last one). So we can break immediately at i = len-1.\n\n  But to be faithful, we do the loop.\n\n  But what if the number is 0? Then n = 360 / gcd(360,0). gcd(360,0)=360? Then n=1. So we avoid division by zero? The gcd function above: when b=0, we return a. So gcd(360,0)=360? Then n=360/360=1.\n\n  Also, if x=0, then gcd(360,0)=360, then n=1.\n\n  Therefore, it's safe.\n\n  However, the input x? We read with %d, so it's integer. But the problem does not specify the range.\n\n  But note: the gcd function: if x=0, then gcd(360,0)=360. Then n=1.\n\n  Also, if x is negative, we take absolute value.\n\n  Therefore, the program is:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          a = abs(a);\n          b = abs(b);\n          while (b) {\n              int temp = b;\n              b = a % b;\n              a = temp;\n          }\n          return a;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          int g = gcd(360, x);\n          int n = 360 / g;\n\n          char s[10];\n          snprintf(s, 10, \"%d\", n);\n          int len = strlen(s);\n          char found = 0;\n          char last_char = 0;\n          for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n              if (s[i] == ' ' || s[i] == '?') {\n                  continue;\n              } else {\n                  last_char = s[i];\n                  found = 1;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (found) {\n              // Define the vowel string\n              char *vo = \"aeiouyAEIOUY\";\n              if (strchr(vo, last_char)) {\n                  printf(\"YES\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n              }\n          } else {\n              // In case the string was empty or all skipped, but that should not happen.\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the original second program breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark. We break at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. And then we output accordingly.\n\n  This program will always output \"NO\", but it does the same steps.\n\n  Let me test with n=1: string \"1\", then last_char='1'. Then check: strchr(vo, '1') returns NULL -> so print \"NO\".\n\n  With n=10: last_char='0' -> \"NO\".\n\n  With n=12: last_char='2' -> \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, we have the same behavior.\n\n  But note: what if the string representation of n had a vowel? For example, if n was 10 and we had a different representation? It's always digits.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" We are not.\n\n  So we output the C program accordingly.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain outputs exactly one line: either \"YES\" or \"NO\". We do the same.\n\n  Therefore, we write the C program as above.\n\n  However, we can avoid the vowel string and the loop? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. We are doing so.\n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the vowel check is always false? But that is an optimization. However, the problem does not require optimization, just the same behavior.\n\n  So we'll do the simulation.\n\n  But note: the original second program does not have a newline in the string? We are not including the newline in the string s. That matches the Python input() which strips the newline.\n\n  Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: we must include the necessary headers.\n\n  Final code:"
