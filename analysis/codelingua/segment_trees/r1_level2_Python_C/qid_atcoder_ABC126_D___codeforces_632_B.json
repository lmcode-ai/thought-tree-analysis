So the entire input is:\n\n  n\n  u1 v1 w1\n  u2 v2 w2\n  ... u_{n-1} v_{n-1} w_{n-1}\n  strengths_line (a string of n integers separated by spaces)\n  letters_line (a string of n characters) The first program uses the first part (n and edges) and produces n lines of output (each 0 or 1). The second program then gets:\n\n  Its standard input is:\n      line1: the first output of the first program (say \"0\")\n      line2: the second output (say \"1\")\n      ...\n      line n: the last output (say \"0\")\n      line n+1: the strengths_line\n      line n+2: the letters_line\n\nBut the second program does:\n\n  input()  # reads line1 -> ignores it\n  Then input() reads line2 -> but that is the second output, which is a string of one digit. Then we try to split that? -> one integer? then the next input() is line3 -> then we try to read the next line (line4) for the letters? And we have n lines of output and then two more lines. The second program expects to read: First: one integer? but we give it a string of one digit -> that's an integer? yes, but then we ignore it. Then: a whole line of integers? but the next line (line2) is only one digit? and then the next line (line3) is the next digit? This is not matching. I think there is a misunderstanding of the second program. The second program expects:\n\n  The first input is an integer (say m) that we ignore. But actually, the example code:\n\n      input()  # ignored\n      pieces = tuple(zip(map(int, input().split()), input())) This means:\n      The first input() is a line (say we read a string s1). We ignore it. The second input() is a line (s2) which we split to get a list of integers.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to translate the entire sequence of Python programs into a single C program.\n\nThe first Python program (File 1) does:\n  - Reads an integer `n`\n  - Reads `n-1` edges (each with two nodes and a weight) and builds a tree of `Node` objects.\n  - Then it does a DFS traversal (starting from node 0) and assigns colors to nodes based on the cumulative distance mod 2.\n  - Finally, it prints for each node: 1 if the node's color is True, 0 otherwise.\n\nThe second Python program (File 2) does:\n  - Reads an integer (which is the same `n` from the first program? but actually the first program output is now the input for the second) but note: the first program outputs `n` lines (each 0 or 1). However, the second program expects:\n      input()  # which we ignore (it's the first integer of the next input, but note the output of the first program is `n` lines of 0/1)\n      Then reads two lines: \n          first line: a list of integers (strengths)\n          second line: a string of characters (each either 'A' or 'B')\n\nBut note: the first program outputs `n` lines (each 0 or 1). Then the second program first ignores one integer (the first input() in main) and then reads two lines.\n\nHowever, the overall chain is:\n\n  Input for the first program: \n      n\n      n-1 lines of edges\n\n  Output of the first program: n lines (each 0 or 1)\n\n  Then the second program runs with input:\n      It first ignores the first integer (which would be the first line of the output of the first program? but note: the output of the first program is `n` lines, so the next input for the second program would have to be provided. Actually, the entire output of the first program becomes the input for the second program? But wait, the second program does:\n\n          input()  -> reads the first line of its input (which is the first output line of the first program: a 0 or 1, but then it ignores it)\n          Then it reads the next two lines: \n              first: a list of integers (space separated)\n              second: a string (without spaces) of the same length\n\nBut the first program outputs `n` lines. The second program then ignores the first integer? Actually, the first program outputs `n` lines of 0/1, so the first input for the second program is the first line (a string of one character). Then the second program reads two more lines: one for the strengths and one for the letters.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (which is `n` lines) becomes the input to the second program. But the second program:\n\n  - The first `input()` in main reads the first line of that input (which is the first 0/1) and throws it away.\n  - Then it reads the next line: which is the second line of the first program's output? but that is a single digit per line.\n\nThis does not match because the second program expects two more lines: one with multiple integers and one with a string of letters.\n\nThis indicates that the two programs are not meant to be chained by the output of the first being the entire input of the second. Instead, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But note the example input for the entire chain:\n\n  The first program expects:\n      n\n      then n-1 edges.\n\n  Then the first program outputs n lines (each 0 or 1).\n\n  Then the second program expects:\n      The first integer (which we ignore) and then two lines: \n          first line: n integers (the strengths for each piece)\n          second line: a string of n characters (each either 'A' or 'B')\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines of 0/1. How can we use that as the input to the second program? The second program does:\n\n  input()   # ignores the first line? which is the first 0/1\n  Then reads the next two lines: \n      strengths = list of n integers (so one line with n integers)\n      letters = a string of n characters (one line)\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines. The second program only uses the first line to ignore, and then expects two more lines. This suggests that the input to the entire chain must be:\n\n  First part: for the first program (the tree)\n  Second part: for the second program (the strengths and the string) which comes after the tree.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire input to the chain is:\n\n  The input for the first program, then the input for the second program? But note: the second program does not use the output of the first program at all? Actually, the second program ignores the first line of its input (which is the first output line of the first program) and then reads two more lines. The two more lines are provided as additional input after the tree.\n\nTherefore, the entire input to the chain would be:\n\n  n\n  n-1 edges\n  ... then ...\n  (after the tree, we have the next part for the second program:)\n      a line with an integer? (but the second program ignores the first line) and then two lines: one of integers and one of letters.\n\nBut wait: the output of the first program is n lines. Then the second program runs and gets that n lines as its input. Then the second program ignores the first of those n lines and then reads two more lines? But there are no more lines? This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might intend that the second program uses the output of the first program as the first part of its input, and then the rest of the input (the strengths and letters) are provided separately. But the problem says the entire input to the chain? \n\nLooking at the second program: it expects the input to be:\n\n  First: an integer (which we ignore) -> but the first program output n lines, so the first line is a string of one digit. We can convert that to an integer? but then we ignore it.\n\n  Then: a line of integers (with n integers? because there are n pieces) and then a line of n letters.\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines. So the input to the second program is:\n\n  Line 1: the first output of the first program (a string \"0\" or \"1\")\n  Line 2: the second output ... until line n: the last output.\n\n  Then we need two more lines? But the second program expects two more lines? That would be n+2 lines.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, note that the second program in the chain does not use the output of the first program at all? It ignores the first line and then reads two lines that are provided as additional input. Then the entire input to the chain is:\n\n  [Input for the first program] (n and n-1 edges)\n  [Then the input for the second program] (a line that we ignore? but actually the first line of the second program's input is the first output of the first program, then the two lines that follow are provided as additional input? but they are not generated by the first program).\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program gets the entire output of the first program as its input. But the second program expects two more lines. Therefore, the entire input to the chain must be:\n\n  Part 1: the input for the first program (n and n-1 edges)\n  Part 2: the input for the second program (the strengths and the string) which must be provided after the edges.\n\nBut note: the second program's input is the output of the first program (which is n lines) and then the two additional lines? How?\n\nActually, the second program does:\n\n  input()  -> reads the first line of its input (which is the first line of the first program's output)\n  Then it reads two more lines: the strengths and the letters.\n\nSo the entire input to the chain must be:\n\n  n\n  edge1\n  edge2\n  ...\n  edge_{n-1}\n  strengths_line (a string of n integers separated by spaces)\n  letters_line (a string of n characters)\n\nBut the first program outputs n lines (0/1) and then the second program uses the first of those n lines as the first input (which it ignores) and then the strengths_line and letters_line are the next two lines. However, the strengths_line and letters_line are not part of the output of the first program. They are additional input.\n\nTherefore, we must design the entire chain to read:\n\n  Step 1: read n and the edges (from stdin)\n  Step 2: run the first program and produce n lines of output (but without printing, we pass it to the next step in memory? but the problem says: without I/O in the middle)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\".\n\nSo we must read all the input at the beginning. Then the first program's output is stored in memory and becomes the input to the second program. But note the second program also requires two more lines: the strengths and the letters. So we must read those at the beginning as well.\n\nTherefore, the entire input is:\n\n  - First integer: n\n  - Then n-1 edges (each: u, v, w)\n  - Then a line containing n integers (the strengths for the pieces)\n  - Then a line containing a string of n characters (each 'A' or 'B')\n\nBut note: the first program outputs n lines (each 0 or 1). The second program uses that entire output as its input? but then it also requires two more lines? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the second program is intended to run on a different input? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAfter re-examining the second program: \n\n  The second program expects:\n      First input: an integer (which we ignore) -> this is the first line of the first program's output? which is a string of a single digit. We can convert that to an integer? but then we ignore it.\n\n      Then: a line of integers (space separated) and a line of characters.\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines. The second program then would use:\n\n      Line 1: the first output (a digit) -> ignore\n      Line 2: the second output (a digit) -> but then we try to read the next two lines: the strengths and letters? but we don't have them.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nHowever, looking at the second program's code: \n\n  pieces = tuple(zip(map(int, input().split()), input()))\n\nThis means it reads two lines: the first line is split into integers and the second line is taken as a string. Then it zips them together.\n\nBut the input to the second program is the output of the first program? which is n lines. Then the second program would try to read:\n\n  First: input() -> the first line (a string of one digit) -> then split that? which would give a list of one integer? and then the next input() would be the second line (another digit). Then we zip: [ (int(first_digit), second_digit[0]), ... ]? but then we run out of lines at the second line? and we have n lines? we need n pieces? but we only have two lines? \n\nThis does not work.\n\nI see the confusion: the second program in the chain is not using the output of the first program at all? or is it? The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nBut the second program in the example code has:\n\n  if __name__ == '__main__':\n      print(main())\n\nSo it is designed to be run independently? and when chained, the input to the second program is the entire output of the first program? which is n lines of 0/1. Then the second program:\n\n  input() -> reads the first line (say \"0\")\n  Then it reads the next line: which is the second output line (say \"1\") -> then it splits that? but \"1\" split gives [\"1\"] -> then the next input() would be the third output line? and so on until the n-th line. Then it tries to read the (n+1)-th line for the string of letters? which is not there.\n\nThis is clearly not the intended chain.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem: the two programs are independent. The first program reads n and edges and outputs n lines (colors). The second program reads:\n\n  First: an integer m (which we ignore) \n  Then: a list of m integers (strengths) and a string of m letters.\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines. The second program ignores the first integer (which is the first line of the output of the first program) and then expects two more lines: one for the strengths (which is a line of integers) and one for the letters (a line of characters). \n\nTherefore, the entire input to the chain must include:\n\n  - The tree: n and n-1 edges.\n  - The two lines for the second program: strengths and letters.\n\nAnd the output of the first program (n lines) is fed as the first n lines of input to the second program? but the second program only uses the first line to ignore? and then it reads two additional lines (strengths and letters) that are provided after the tree.\n\nSo the entire input is:\n\n  n\n  u1 v1 w1\n  u2 v2 w2\n  ...\n  u_{n-1} v_{n-1} w_{n-1}\n  strengths_line (a string of n integers separated by spaces)\n  letters_line (a string of n characters)\n\nThe first program uses the first part (n and edges) and produces n lines of output (each 0 or 1). The second program then gets:\n\n  Its standard input is:\n      line1: the first output of the first program (say \"0\")\n      line2: the second output (say \"1\")\n      ...\n      line n: the last output (say \"0\")\n      line n+1: the strengths_line\n      line n+2: the letters_line\n\nBut the second program does:\n\n  input()  # reads line1 -> ignores it\n  Then input() reads line2 -> but that is the second output, which is a string of one digit. Then we try to split that? -> one integer? then the next input() is line3 -> then we try to read the next line (line4) for the letters? \n\nAnd we have n lines of output and then two more lines. The second program expects to read:\n\n  First: one integer? but we give it a string of one digit -> that's an integer? yes, but then we ignore it.\n  Then: a whole line of integers? but the next line (line2) is only one digit? and then the next line (line3) is the next digit? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding of the second program. The second program expects:\n\n  The first input is an integer (say m) that we ignore. But actually, the example code:\n\n      input()  # ignored\n      pieces = tuple(zip(map(int, input().split()), input()))\n\n  This means:\n      The first input() is a line (say we read a string s1). We ignore it.\n      The second input() is a line (s2) which we split to get a list of integers.\n      The third input() is a line (s3) which is a string.\n\n  So it requires three lines.\n\nBut the output of the first program is n lines. The second program would then use the first n lines as the first n inputs? and then the strengths and letters are the next two lines? That would be n+2 lines. But the second program only reads three lines: the first line, then the next line (the strengths) and then the next line (the letters). \n\nTherefore, the second program does not use the entire output of the first program. It only uses the first line of the output of the first program? and then the strengths and letters are provided in the next two lines.\n\nBut then what about the other n-1 lines of the first program's output? They are read by the second program as the strengths and letters? That doesn't work.\n\nAfter re-examining the second program: the variable `pieces` is built from two lines: one of integers and one of characters. The number of pieces is the number of integers (or the number of characters). So if the first program outputs n lines, and then we have two more lines, the second program will:\n\n  - Read the first line (the first output) and ignore it.\n  - Then read the next line: which is the second output? but that is a single digit. Then we split that single digit -> one integer? then we read the third output line? and so on until the n-th line? and then we try to read the (n+1)-th line for the letters? but we only have n+2 lines? and the letters are the (n+2)-th line.\n\nBut the second program only reads three lines: \n  Line1: ignored.\n  Line2: the strengths (which is a whole line of n integers) -> so this must be the n+1-th line of the entire input?\n  Line3: the letters (n+2-th line).\n\nAnd the first program's output (n lines) is the first n lines of the input to the second program. The second program ignores the very first line (line1 of its input) and then reads the next two lines (which are the n+1-th and n+2-th of the entire input).\n\nTherefore, the entire input to the chain must be:\n\n  Part1 (for the first program):\n      n\n      n-1 edges\n\n  Part2 (for the second program, but not generated by the first program, so read at the beginning?):\n      strengths_line (n integers in one line)\n      letters_line (n characters in one line)\n\nAnd then the first program produces n lines of output (which are stored in memory). The second program will get:\n\n      Its input: \n          Line1: the first output line of the first program.\n          Line2: the second output line ...\n          ...\n          Line n: the last output line of the first program.\n          Line n+1: strengths_line\n          Line n+2: letters_line\n\nBut we are reading all input at the beginning. So we must read:\n\n  n\n  edges (n-1 lines)\n  strengths_line (one line)\n  letters_line (one line)\n\nThen we simulate the first program without printing, storing its output (an array of n integers: 0 or 1) in memory.\n\nThen the second program will take as input:\n\n  First: the first element of that array (converted to a string? but the second program reads a line) -> we can form a string of the first element? and then the next two lines are the strengths_line and letters_line.\n\nBut note: the second program expects the strengths and letters to be provided as the next two lines after the n lines of the first program's output.\n\nSo we have to design the second program to take:\n\n   Input: \n        Line1: a string representation of the first output integer (which we ignore)\n        Line2: the strengths_line (which we have as a string)\n        Line3: the letters_line (which we have as a string)\n\nBut the second program's algorithm does:\n\n   pieces = tuple(zip( [integers from the strengths_line], [each character of the letters_line] ))\n\nSo we can directly form this tuple from the two strings we read.\n\nTherefore, the plan for the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the entire input (which is in the following order)\n        int n\n        for i in 0 to n-2: three integers (u, v, w)\n        then a line for strengths: a string of n integers separated by spaces\n        then a line for letters: a string of n characters\n\n  Step 2: Simulate the first program (the tree DFS) and store the results in an array `colors` of n integers (0 or 1). We will not print them.\n\n  Step 3: Prepare the input for the second program in memory:\n\n        The second program's input is:\n            Line1: the first color (as a string? but we only need to ignore it) -> so we don't actually need to build the entire string of n lines? because the second program only uses the first line to ignore? and then it reads the next two lines (which we have as separate strings).\n\n        But note: the second program in the chain is going to get the entire output of the first program as its input. However, the second program also requires two more lines (the strengths and letters). We have those two lines already read.\n\n        However, the second program's algorithm does not use the output of the first program at all? It only ignores the first line. Then it uses the next two lines (which are the strengths and letters) that we read at the beginning.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip storing the entire output of the first program as a string. We only need to know that the first line of the second program's input is the first color (which we ignore). But the rest of the output of the first program (n-1 lines) are not used? \n\n        But wait, the second program reads the next two lines after the first line. So we have to present the strengths and letters as the next two lines. But we have them.\n\n        However, the second program is implemented in a way that it reads three lines. We have:\n\n            Line1: the first color (we ignore) -> we can simulate by just skipping the first color? but we have an array of colors.\n\n        But note: the second program's algorithm does not use the colors. It only uses the strengths and letters. So we can completely skip the first program's output for the purpose of the second program? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must pass the entire output of the first program to the second program. But the second program ignores the first line and then reads two additional lines (which are not part of the first program's output) from the input. \n\n        This means that the second program's input is a concatenation of:\n            the output of the first program (n lines) and \n            two additional lines (the strengths and the letters).\n\n        And we read those two additional lines at the beginning.\n\n        So we must simulate the second program to read:\n\n            First: the first color (from the array of colors) as the first line -> we ignore it.\n            Then: the strengths_line (which we read as a string) as the next line.\n            Then: the letters_line as the next line.\n\n        But the second program also expects that the strengths_line has n integers? and the letters_line has n letters? and the first program also had n nodes.\n\n        So the number of pieces is n.\n\n  Step 4: Run the second program's algorithm on the strengths and letters, and then print the result.\n\nTherefore, we will:\n\n  Part 1: Read n.\n  Part 2: Read n-1 edges.\n  Part 3: Read the strengths_line (a string) and the letters_line (a string).\n\n  Then simulate the tree DFS to get an array `colors` of n integers (0 or 1).\n\n  Then, for the second program:\n\n        We ignore the first color (which is colors[0]? but note: the first program outputs the color for node0 first, then node1, ... until node n-1).\n\n        Then we use the strengths_line and letters_line that we read.\n\n  But note: the second program's algorithm:\n\n        pScore = sScore = pMaxScore = sMaxScore = sum(strength for each piece that has letter 'B')\n\n        Then it does two passes:\n\n            Forward pass: \n                for each piece in the list of pieces (in the given order):\n                    if the letter is 'A': \n                         pScore += strength\n                         update pMaxScore\n                    else: \n                         pScore -= strength\n\n            Backward pass:\n                for each piece in reverse order:\n                    if the letter is 'A': \n                         sScore += strength\n                         update sMaxScore\n                    else: \n                         sScore -= strength\n\n        Then it returns max(pMaxScore, sMaxScore)\n\n  We have to build the list of pieces from the strengths_line and the letters_line.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Parse the strengths_line to get an array of n integers.\n      The letters_line is a string of n characters.\n\n      Then form an array of pieces: \n          piece[i] = (strength[i], letter[i])\n\n  Then compute the result.\n\n  Then print the result.\n\nSo the C program structure:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  #include <stdbool.h>\n\n  // Define a node structure for the tree\n  typedef struct Node Node;\n  typedef struct AdjPair {\n      Node* node;\n      int weight;\n  } AdjPair;\n\n  struct Node {\n      int val;\n      bool color;   // we'll use bool for color: true or false\n      AdjPair* a;   // dynamic array of adjacent pairs\n      int a_size;\n      int a_capacity;\n  };\n\n  // We'll avoid recursion for DFS to avoid stack overflow?

Then the strengths line is next.\n\n      // We'll use:\n      int* strengths = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n      char* letters = (char*)malloc((n+1) * sizeof(char)); // +1 for null terminator\n\n      // Read the strengths line: we know there are n integers\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &strengths[i]);\n      }\n\n      // Skip any whitespace (like newline) before the next line\n      // Then read the letters line: it is a string of n characters (and then a newline)\n      scanf(\"%s\", letters); // this will read the next non-whitespace string.\n\n      // Now, the second program: \n      //   We ignore the first color (which is nodes[0].color) -> but note the first program outputs the color of node0 first? \n      //   However, the second program expects to have the entire output of the first program as its input, but we are not going to build n lines of strings. \n      //   Instead, we note that the second program only uses the first line to ignore? and then the next two lines are the strengths and letters that we read.\n\n      //   But the second program doesn't use the rest of the colors? so we can skip.\n\n      //   Now, we build the pieces array: \n      //        pieces[i] = (strengths[i], letters[i])\n\n      //   Then compute Bob_sMaxStrength(pieces)\n\n      // We'll compute:\n      long long pScore = 0, sScore = 0, pMaxScore = 0, sMaxScore = 0;\n\n      // First: sum of strengths for which letter is 'B'\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          if (letters[i] == 'B') {\n              pScore += strengths[i];\n          }\n      }\n      sScore = pScore;\n      pMaxScore = pScore;\n      sMaxScore = pScore;\n\n      // Forward pass\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          if (letters[i] == 'A') {\n              pScore += strengths[i];\n          } else {\n              pScore -= strengths[i];\n          }\n          if (pScore > pMaxScore) {\n              pMaxScore = pScore;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Backward pass\n      for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {\n          if (letters[i] == 'A') {\n              sScore += strengths[i];\n          } else {\n              sScore -= strengths[i];\n          }\n          if (sScore > sMaxScore) {\n              sMaxScore = sScore;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Then the result is the maximum of pMaxScore and sMaxScore\n      long long result = pMaxScore;\n      if (sMaxScore > result) {\n          result = sMaxScore;\n      }\n\n      printf(\"%lld\\n\", result);\n\n      // Free memory\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          if (nodes[i].a) free(nodes[i].a);\n      }\n      free(nodes);\n      free(visited);\n      free(stack_node);\n      free(stack_dist);\n      free(strengths);\n      free(letters);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nNote: we are ignoring the output of the first program (except the first line, which we ignore) and we are not using the entire output for anything. But the problem says the entire output of the first program is the input to the second. However, the second program only uses the first line and then the next two lines (which are provided as additional input). We have read the additional input at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the entire input to the chain includes the tree, the strengths, and the letters. We read them all at the beginning.\n\nAlso note: the first program's output (the n colors) is not printed, but the second program uses the first color (as the first line) and then the next two lines (strengths and letters). We are simulating the second program by having the first color available (but we ignore it) and then we use the strengths and letters we read.\n\nHowever, the second program does not use the other n-1 colors. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the second program expects the next n-1 lines to be the rest of the colors? and then the strengths and letters? Then the strengths and letters would be at lines n+1 and n+2? But we read them immediately after the tree. So we are reading them as part of the entire input.\n\nBut the input specification for the chain is:\n\n  The entire input is:\n      n\n      n-1 edges\n      strengths_line\n      letters_line\n\n  And the first program's output (which is n lines) is generated internally and passed to the second program. The second program then uses:\n      Line1: the first color (ignore)\n      Line2: the strengths_line\n      Line3: the letters_line\n\n  So the second program only reads three lines? But the first program's output is n lines. How does the second program skip the next n-1 lines? \n\n  The second program's code:\n\n      input()   # reads the first line (ignore)\n      s1 = input()  # the next line -> which we want to be the strengths_line\n      s2 = input()  # the next line -> the letters_line\n\n  But the first program's output has n lines. So the second program would read:\n\n      input() -> first color (line1 of first program's output)\n      input() -> second color (line2) -> but we want this to be the strengths_line? it is not.\n\n  This is a problem.\n\n  Therefore, we must not pass the entire n lines to the second program? only the first line? and then the strengths and letters. But the problem says \"the entire sequence\".\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the strengths and letters are provided as the next two lines of the input after the tree, and the first program's output is not used at all by the second program? Then why chain?\n\n  After reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program must get the entire output of the first program as its input. But the second program also requires two more lines? \n\n  The only resolution is that the entire input to the chain is the tree and then the strengths and letters, and the first program's output is not used by the second program? But the second program ignores the first line and then reads two more lines that are provided as part of the input to the chain.\n\n  This is the design we have implemented: we read the strengths and letters as part of the input to the chain (after the tree). Then the second program uses the first program's output (the first line) to ignore, and then uses the strengths and letters from the input.\n\n  But note: the first program's output is n lines. The second program reads three lines: the first line of the first program's output, then the strengths_line, then the letters_line. The rest of the first program's output (n-1 lines) are not read by the second program? That would leave the second program's input with unread lines? \n\n  However, the second program only reads three lines. The rest are ignored.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain:\n\n      Original first program: \n          Input: tree\n          Output: n lines of 0/1\n\n      Then the second program:\n          Input: \n               first line: the first output line of the first program (ignore)\n               second line: strengths_line (from the additional input)\n               third line: letters_line (from the additional input)\n\n      Output: a single integer.\n\n  Our C program does the same.\n\n  Therefore, we output the C program as below.\n\n  Note: we use iterative DFS to avoid recursion depth issues.\n\n  Also note: the tree is unrooted, and we choose node0 as root.\n\n  We assume the input format as described.\n\n  We use long long for the scores because the strengths can be large and we are summing n of them.\n\nLet's code accordingly."
