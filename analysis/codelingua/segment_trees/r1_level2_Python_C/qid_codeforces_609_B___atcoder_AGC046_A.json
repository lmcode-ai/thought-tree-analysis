We can write:\n\n                    res += (n-i) - l[lst[i]]\n\n                And then update: l[lst[i]] = l[lst[i]] - 1\n\n                But note: the else branch does not update the frequency? Actually, it does update?",

Then the second program: \n                x=2\n                gcd(360,2)=2\n                360//2 = 180. Output: 180. But the first program in Python for [1,2,1] would output 2? Then the second program would read 2 and output 180. So the final output is 180. We write the C program accordingly. Steps:\n\n          We'll implement a hash table for long integers (for the keys) and integer counts. We'll define:\n\n            #define MOD 1000003\n\n            struct node {\n                long key;\n                int count;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            struct node* table[MOD];\n\n          Functions for the hash table:\n\n            int get_hash(long key) {\n                long h = key % MOD; if (h < 0) h += MOD;\n                return (int)h;\n            }\n\n            void insert(long key, int count) {\n                int idx = get_hash(key);\n                struct node* p = table[idx];\n                while (p) {\n                    if (p->key == key) {\n                        p->count = count;   // actually, we are going to update?

If an element appears multiple times, then the first time we see it, frequency is >=2 -> if branch, then we decrement. The next time we see the same element, the frequency is the previous frequency minus one (so if originally 2, then becomes 1) -> else branch? But then we don't update?

At i1: frequency = k (if we haven't updated) -> but wait: we built the frequency for the entire array, so at the beginning the frequency for the element is k. Then at index i1: we update the frequency to k-1 (if k>1) and then at index i2: we look up and get k-1. So for the j-th occurrence (j from 1 to k-1): we use frequency = k - j + 1?

And we do: 360 / g, which is integer division because both 360 and g are integers. However, if g is 0? \n            gcd(360, res) is never 0? Because gcd(360,0)=360, then 360/360=1. So it's safe. Let's test with the example: [1,2,1] -> res=2, then gcd(360,2)=2, then 360/2=180. Another example: n=0? Then we read n=0, m=0, then no numbers. Then the array is empty. Then the first loop (building frequency) does nothing. Then the second loop: from i=0 to n-1 (which is 0 times) -> res=0. Then gcd(360,0)=360 -> 360/360=1 -> output 1. The original first program for n=0 would output 0? Then the second program would read 0 and output 360//gcd(360,0)=360//360=1. So it matches. However, note: the first program for n=0: \n            n, m = 0,0\n            lst = list() -> empty. l = {}\n            for i in range(0): nothing -> res=0 -> print(0) Then second program: \n            x=0 -> 360 // gcd(360,0) = 360 // 360 = 1 -> output 1. So the final output is 1. Therefore, the C program for n=0 outputs 1. We are done. But note: the first program uses n and m. The m is not used. So we read it and ignore. We assume the input format: first two integers n and m, then n integers. We'll write accordingly. Note: the numbers in the list can be large? We use long for the list and for the keys. Why long? The problem does not specify the range of the integers.",

The maximum value of res: worst-case, the first program:\n\n            In the else branch: n-i-1: the sum over i: \n                i=0: n-1\n                i=1: n-2\n                ... i=n-1: 0 So the else branch total: sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-1-i) = n*(n-1)/2. In the if branch: (n-i) - freq: worst-case, if the entire array is the same element? Then for the first element: freq = n -> then (n-0) - n = 0. Then for the second: freq = n-1 -> (n-1) - (n-1) = 0.\n                ... So total=0. But if the array has distinct elements? Then we are always in the else branch: total = n*(n-1)/2. So the maximum res is O(n^2). n can be up to 10^5? Then n^2 = 10^10, which is within long (if long is 64-bit? but in C, long can be 32-bit on Windows). To be safe, we use long long for res? But the second program: gcd(360, res) -> res might be large? The gcd algorithm is efficient (O(log(min(360,res)))). So it's safe.",

But the frequency counts are integers (n is integer). However, the keys in the list: the problem says integers, so they can be long long? We'll use long long for the keys and for the array. Then the gcd function: we change to long long. Alternatively, we can use long long for the entire program? Because the res might be as large as 10^10 (if n=10^5, then n*(n-1)/2 = 5e9) which fits in long long. We'll change:\n\n            long long *lst = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n\n            and\n\n            struct node {\n                long long key;\n                int count;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            and update the functions accordingly.

And the res: long long. But note: the first program: the res is an integer that the second program reads. The second program uses x = res. Then the second program uses integer arithmetic? But the gcd function we defined for long long? It's okay because the numbers are integers. We'll write:\n\n            long long res = 0;\n\n            ...\n\n            long long g = gcd(360, res);\n            long long result = 360 / g; But 360 is an integer, and res is long long? Then the gcd function will work. However, note: 360 is small. The gcd(360, res) is the same as gcd(360, res % 360)? We don't need to, but the algorithm is efficient. Now, the final code: We use long long for keys and for res.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the two Python programs into a single C program.\n The first program does:\n   Read n, m and then a list of n integers.\n   Then it processes the list to compute a value 'res' and prints it.\n\n The second program does:\n   Reads an integer x, then computes 360 // gcd(360, x) and prints it.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n So, the overall input to the chain is: \n   First, the two integers n and m, and then n integers for the list.\n Then the output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n   Step 1: Read n, m and a list of n integers. Compute res and output it (but this output is not printed to the user, it becomes the input to step2).\n   Step 2: Take that integer (res) as x, and then compute 360 // gcd(360, x) and output that.\n\n But note: the first program prints 'res', and that print is the only output of the first program. Then the second program reads that integer.\n\n However, the problem says: \n   \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\"\n   \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So in the combined C program:\n   - We read the initial input (n, m and the list of n integers) at the beginning.\n   - We compute the first result (res) without printing it.\n   - Then we use that res as the input to the second computation (without reading again, because the second program in the chain would read from the output of the first).\n   - Then we compute the second result and print that (as the final output).\n\n Therefore, the final output of the entire chain is the result of the second program.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and m (though m is not used in the first program?).\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n\n 3. Implement the first program's logic to compute 'res':\n    - We'll create a frequency map for the list (like the dictionary 'l').\n    - Then iterate through the list, updating the frequency and computing the result.\n\n 4. Then, we have an integer 'res' (which was the output of the first program). Now we use that as 'x' in the second program.\n\n 5. Compute gcd(360, res) and then compute 360 divided by that gcd (using integer division).\n\n 6. Print that result.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n For the first part:\n   We need an array to store the list of integers.\n   We need a frequency map (we can use an array if the numbers are bounded? but the problem doesn't specify bounds) or a hash map? \n   However, the problem says n and m are given, but m is not used. The list values? We don't know the range.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the range, we can try to use an array for frequencies if we know the numbers are small? \n   But we cannot assume that. Alternatively, we can use a hash map but in C we don't have a built-in one. \n\n   However, note the first program uses a dictionary and the keys are the numbers in the list. The list has n elements (n can be large?).\n\n   But observe: the first program does:\n        for i in range(n):\n            if lst[i] not in l:\n                l[lst[i]] = 1\n            else:\n                l[lst[i]] += 1\n\n   Then in the next loop, it uses l[lst[i]] and then decrements it.\n\n   We can do the same in C by using a dynamic data structure? But we don't know the range.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an array of integers for the list and then for the frequency we can use a hash table. Since we don't know the range and to be safe, we can use a simple array if the values are not too large? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   However, note: the problem says we are to translate the entire sequence. We must handle the same inputs.\n\n   Let's reconsider: the first program uses a dictionary and then iterates. We can use a dynamic array of pairs? But that would be inefficient.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        We can first read the entire list and then we can count the frequency by iterating and storing in a hash table.\n\n   How to implement a hash table in C? We don't want to be too complex. Alternatively, we can sort? But the algorithm uses the original order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: read the array.\n\n        Step 2: create a frequency array for the entire array? But if the numbers are large, we cannot allocate a big array.\n\n   Since the constraints are not given, we have to assume the worst. We can use a balanced BST or a hash table. In C, we can use the Glib if we were allowed external libraries? But we are not.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a linked list for the frequency? But that would be O(n^2). The original Python program uses a dictionary which is O(n) on average.\n\n   We need an efficient solution.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the chain is executed in sequence and we must reproduce the same behavior.\n\n   Let's think: the first program is O(n). We can do O(n) in C if we use a hash table. But without a built-in, we have to implement one? That is complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an array and then sort the array along with the original indices? But the algorithm requires the original order.\n\n   Actually, the algorithm:\n\n        res = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if l[lst[i]] > 1:\n                res += n - i - l[lst[i]]\n                l[lst[i]] -= 1\n            else:\n                res += n - i - 1\n\n   We can precompute the frequency of each element in the entire array (by a first pass). Then we can have an array `freq` that we update as we traverse.\n\n   But note: the frequency of an element at position i is the remaining frequency (we start with the total frequency, and then at each occurrence we decrement the frequency).\n\n   So we can:\n\n        Step 1: Count the frequency of each number (first pass). We need to store the counts for each distinct number.\n\n        Step 2: We traverse the array, and for the current element, we update the count (decrement) and then use the current count.\n\n        However, in the first program, the dictionary `l` is built for the entire array and then updated as we go.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            We need an array `freq` that maps the number to its current frequency. We start by counting the frequency for each distinct number.\n\n        How to store `freq`? We can use a data structure that maps an integer (the value) to an integer (its frequency). \n\n        The problem: the values can be very large? Then we cannot use an array.\n\n        We can use a dynamic structure. Since n is the number of elements, we can have at most n distinct numbers? Actually, at most n.\n\n        We can use a dynamic array of distinct numbers and then a frequency array? But then the lookup would be O(n) per element -> O(n^2). Worst-case n=10^5 would be 10^10 operations.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a balanced BST or a hash table. In C, we can use `uthash`? But we are not allowed external libraries.\n\n        We have to do without. Since the problem does not specify the constraints, we have to assume that n is moderate? Or we must implement a hash table.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since this is an example, I will assume that the values are not too large (say, within 0 to 10^6) and then we can use an array of size 1000001? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a hash table with a simple modulo-based hashing and chaining. But that would be complex.\n\n        However, note that the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". It must work for the same inputs as the Python program.\n\n        Since the Python program uses a dictionary and can handle any integer, we must handle any integer.\n\n        We have two options:\n\n          Option 1: Sort the array and then compress the values? But we need to update frequencies per index in the original order.\n\n          Option 2: Implement a simple hash table with chaining.\n\n        We are going to implement a simple hash table for integers.\n\n        Steps for the hash table:\n\n          We'll choose a prime for the modulus, say 1000003 (a prime around 10^6).\n          We'll create an array of linked lists (buckets) of size 1000003.\n\n        We need operations:\n          - insert a key initially (with frequency count from the entire array)\n          - update the frequency (decrement) and retrieve the current frequency.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          First, we traverse the array to count the frequencies. We'll use the hash table to count.\n\n          Then, we traverse again and for each element, we update the frequency in the hash table and use the current frequency.\n\n        We'll create a struct for the hash table node:\n\n          struct node {\n              long key;\n              int count;\n              struct node *next;\n          };\n\n        Then an array of buckets: struct node *table[1000003];\n\n        But note: the modulus: we take abs(key) % 1000003? But negative? The problem does not say the integers are positive.\n\n        We can use: (key % mod + mod) % mod to handle negative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different modulus function.\n\n        However, to keep it simple, we assume the keys can be negative? The problem does not specify.\n\n        We'll handle negative by:\n\n          unsigned long hashkey = (unsigned long)key % 1000003;\n\n        But note: negative modulo in C: we can do:\n\n          long hashkey = key % 1000003;\n          if (hashkey < 0) hashkey += 1000003;\n\n        Then use hashkey as index.\n\n        But the modulus operation for negative in C is implementation defined? Actually, we can use:\n\n          hashkey = ((key % 1000003) + 1000003) % 1000003;\n\n        However, we can also use absolute value? But then collisions between positive and negative? The problem does not say if negative numbers are present.\n\n        But the problem says: the list of integers. So they could be negative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: we do not know the range, but we know the maximum distinct numbers is n. So we can also use a dynamic array of pairs (key, count) and then do a linear search per element? But that would be O(n^2). We are not sure if n is small.\n\n        We must decide: if n is small (like a few thousand) then O(n^2) is acceptable. Otherwise, we need a hash table.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe for large n (like 10^5), we implement a hash table.\n\n        Steps for the first program:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and m (though m is unused).\n          Step 2: Read n integers into an array `lst`.\n\n          Step 3: Create a hash table to count the frequency of each distinct integer in `lst`.\n\n          Step 4: Traverse the array again, and for each element at index i (0-indexed):\n                  - Look up the current frequency of lst[i] in the hash table -> let it be `freq`.\n                  - Then:\n                      if freq > 1:\n                          res += (n - i - 1) - (freq - 1)   [because: n-i-1 is the number of elements from i+1 to end, and we subtract (freq-1) because there are (freq-1) remaining occurrences?]\n                          Actually, the original: \n                              res += n - i - l[lst[i]]\n                          and then we do: l[lst[i]] -= 1.\n\n                  But note: the original program does:\n                      if l[lst[i]] > 1:\n                          res += n - i - l[lst[i]]\n                          l[lst[i]] -= 1\n                      else:\n                          res += n - i - 1   [which is the same as: n-i-1]\n\n                  However, note: in the first case, we are subtracting the current frequency (which includes the current element? Actually, no: the frequency at the start of the loop for element at index i is the total frequency of that element from index i to the end? Actually, the dictionary was built for the entire array, and then we are updating as we go.\n\n          How the frequency is updated:\n\n            We start with the entire array. Then at index i, we are about to process the element. The frequency stored for the element is the number of times it appears from i to the end? Actually, no: the dictionary was built for the entire array. Then in the loop we decrement at the end of processing the current element.\n\n          Therefore, at the moment we process index i:\n\n            The current frequency of lst[i] (which is stored in the dictionary) is the frequency from i to the end (including the current one).\n\n          Then:\n\n            In the if branch: \n                res += n - i - l[lst[i]]   # here, l[lst[i]] is the current frequency (which includes the current element and the ones after)\n                Then we decrement: so the next occurrence of the same element will have one less.\n\n            Actually, let me break it:\n\n                n - i: is the total number of elements from i to the end (including i).\n                But we subtract l[lst[i]]: which is the number of times the element appears from i to the end (including the current one).\n\n                So: n-i - l[lst[i]] = (number of elements from i to the end) minus (the frequency of the element in the rest including current) -> that gives the number of elements that are NOT lst[i] from i to the end? Actually, no: because the frequency is the count of the same element. Then:\n\n                    n-i: total elements from i onward (including i) -> count = (n-i)\n                    l[lst[i]]: count of the element in the rest (including the current) -> so the number of elements that are different from lst[i] in the rest is: (n-i) - l[lst[i]]\n\n                But wait: the formula in the else branch is: n-i-1 -> which is the number of elements from i+1 to the end.\n\n                Why in the else branch? Because if there is only one occurrence (the current one) then we don't subtract the frequency? Actually, we subtract 1 for the current element? \n\n                Actually, the else branch: \n                    res += n - i - 1\n\n                This equals the total number of elements from i+1 to the end (which are all different from lst[i] because there are no more of this element).\n\n                And in the if branch: \n                    res += n - i - l[lst[i]]\n\n                This equals: (n-i) - l[lst[i]] = (the total number of elements from i onward) minus (the total frequency of the element in the entire remaining array) -> which gives the number of elements that are not equal to lst[i] in the remaining array (from i onward). But note: the current element is included in both? \n\n                Actually, the current element is at i, and we are counting the entire remaining array (from i onward) and the frequency includes the current element. So:\n\n                    n-i = total elements from i onward (including the current)\n                    l[lst[i]] = frequency of the current element in the entire remaining array (which includes the current and the ones after)\n\n                Therefore, the expression (n-i - l[lst[i]]) is the count of elements that are not equal to lst[i] in the entire remaining array (from i onward). \n\n                Why then in the else branch we use n-i-1? Because if the current element is the last occurrence, then the frequency is 1. Then:\n\n                    n-i - 1 = (n-i) - 1   -> which is the same as: (n-i) - l[lst[i]] because l[lst[i]] is 1.\n\n                So actually, the two cases can be merged? \n\n                We can write:\n\n                    res += (n-i) - l[lst[i]]\n\n                And then update: l[lst[i]] = l[lst[i]] - 1\n\n                But note: the else branch does not update the frequency? Actually, it does update? No, in the if branch we update (decrement) and in the else branch we do nothing? But wait, in the if branch we update, and the else branch we don't? Actually, in the else branch, we don't update the frequency? \n\n                But look: the else branch is for the case when the frequency is 1. Then we do:\n\n                    res += n-i-1\n\n                and then we don't update the frequency? But then the next time we see the same element? Actually, if the frequency is 1, then after processing this element, the frequency becomes 0. But we are going to decrement the frequency in the if branch, but not in the else. How is the frequency updated for the next element? \n\n                Actually, the frequency is stored in the dictionary and we update it only in the if branch? Then for the same element that appears again, we would have an old frequency? \n\n                But note: we are traversing the array. For an element that appears multiple times, we will process each occurrence. For the first occurrence (if there are multiple) we enter the if branch (because frequency is >1) and we decrement. Then the next occurrence will see a frequency that is one less. The last occurrence will see frequency=1 and then enter the else branch, and we don't decrement? But then the frequency remains 1? \n\n                However, after the last occurrence, there are no more, so it doesn't matter.\n\n                But actually, we must update the frequency for every occurrence? Because even in the else branch, we are done with the element? So we should decrement? \n\n                The original code:\n\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if l[lst[i]] > 1:\n                            res += n - i - l[lst[i]]\n                            l[lst[i]] -= 1\n                        else:\n                            res += n - i - 1\n\n                This means: for an element that has frequency 1 at the moment we process it, we do not update the dictionary? \n\n                Example: [1, 2, 1] \n                    i=0: element=1, l[1]=2 -> if branch: res += 3-0-2 = 1; then l[1] becomes 1.\n                    i=1: element=2, l[2]=1 -> else branch: res += 3-1-1 = 1; total res=2.\n                    i=2: element=1, l[1]=1 -> else branch: res += 3-2-1 = 0; total res=2.\n\n                But what if we updated the frequency in the else branch? Then at i=2: we would have l[1]=0? Then we would use the if branch? But it's 0, which is not >1 -> else? Then we do: res += 3-2-1 = 0.\n\n                Actually, we don't need to update the frequency in the else branch? Because after processing the last occurrence, we don't use it again? \n\n                So in our C implementation, we do:\n\n                    for i from 0 to n-1:\n                        get the current frequency f of lst[i] from the hash table.\n                        if f > 1:\n                            res += n - i - f;\n                            update the hash table: set the frequency of lst[i] to f-1.\n                        else:\n                            res += n - i - 1;\n\n                But note: the frequency we get at the current element is the frequency from the current index to the end? \n\n                Actually, the frequency we stored in the hash table at the beginning is the entire array. Then we update as we traverse. So at the start of the loop for index i, the frequency of an element is the frequency in the subarray from i to the end.\n\n                Why? Because every time we process an element, we decrement the frequency of that element (only in the if branch). But note: the else branch does not decrement. So for an element that is the last occurrence, we never decrement? Then the frequency remains 1? \n\n                But that's okay because after the last occurrence, we don't see it again.\n\n                However, we must note: the frequency we use at the current element is the frequency that includes the current element and all the same elements after it. And when we decrement in the if branch, we are removing the current element from the count for the next occurrences? \n\n                Actually, we are updating the frequency for the next occurrences: when we process the next element, the frequency of the same element will be the frequency from that next index to the end.\n\n                So the algorithm is:\n\n                    We start by building the frequency for the entire array.\n\n                    Then we traverse from index 0 to n-1:\n\n                         freq = frequency of lst[i] at this moment (which is the count of lst[i] from i to the end)\n\n                         if freq > 1:\n                             res += (n-i) - freq;   [which is the count of elements that are not lst[i] from i to the end?]\n                             then set frequency of lst[i] to freq-1   (because we are removing the current element)\n\n                         else:\n                             res += (n-i-1)   [because the current element is the last occurrence, so the rest (n-i-1) elements are all different?]\n\n                But note: in the if branch, we are not subtracting the current element? Actually, we are: the frequency includes the current element, and we are subtracting the entire frequency. Then we subtract the current element from the frequency for the next occurrences.\n\n                So the code for the first part:\n\n                    long res = 0;\n                    // Build frequency hash table for the entire array\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                         // insert lst[i] into the hash table or update count\n                    }\n\n                    // Now traverse the array\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                         long key = lst[i];\n                         int freq = get_frequency(key);   // returns the current frequency of key\n\n                         if (freq > 1) {\n                             res += (n - i) - freq;   // note: n-i is the total from i onward, and we subtract the frequency (which is the count of key from i onward) -> gives the count of non-key from i onward\n                             update_frequency(key, freq-1);\n                         } else {\n                             res += (n - i - 1);\n                         }\n                    }\n\n          However, note: in the else branch, we don't update the frequency? But we should update? Because the current element is being processed. The frequency should be reduced by one? But the next time we see the same element? Actually, we won't see it again because it's the last? So we can update or not? It doesn't matter. But to keep the state consistent, we can update in both branches? \n\n          Actually, the original program only updates in the if branch. So we do the same.\n\n          But note: the else branch is for freq==1? Then if we update, we set it to 0. Then if we see the same element again? We won't because it's the last. So we can update in both branches? Actually, the original does not update in the else branch. So we don't.\n\n        Step 5: Then we have the integer `res` (which was the output of the first program). Now we use it as the input to the second program.\n\n        Step 6: Compute gcd(360, res). Note: res might be negative? The problem does not specify. The gcd function should use absolute values? \n\n          The gcd function:\n\n            long gcd(long a, long b) {\n                a = a > 0 ? a : -a;\n                b = b > 0 ? b : -b;\n                while (b) {\n                    long temp = b;\n                    b = a % b;\n                    a = temp;\n                }\n                return a;\n            }\n\n          Then compute: 360 / gcd(360, res)   -> but note: integer division? The Python program uses integer division (//). \n\n          However, note: gcd(360, res) must divide 360? So it is an integer. Then 360 divided by the gcd is an integer.\n\n        Step 7: Print that integer.\n\n        But note: what if res is 0? \n          gcd(360,0) = 360 -> then 360 // 360 = 1.\n\n        However, the first program: what is the range of res? \n\n          The first program: \n              res = 0\n              for i in range(n):\n                  if ...: res += (n-i) - l[lst[i]]   [which is nonnegative?] \n                  else: res += n-i-1   [nonnegative?]\n\n          But note: (n-i) - l[lst[i]] could be negative? \n          At the start, l[lst[i]] is the frequency of the element in the entire array. Then for the first occurrence, if the element appears many times, then l[lst[i]] can be large. But (n-i) is the number of elements from i onward. The frequency l[lst[i]] is at most (n-i) because the element only appears in the rest? Actually, the frequency we have is the frequency in the entire array? But we built the frequency for the entire array, then we are updating as we traverse? \n\n          Actually, at the moment we are at index i, the frequency of the element is the frequency from i to the end. And we built the frequency for the entire array, and then we updated for indices 0 to i-1? So at index i, the frequency is the frequency in the entire array minus the number of times we've seen the element so far? \n\n          But note: we built the frequency for the entire array at the beginning. Then we traverse from 0 to n-1 and for the same element we decrement the frequency in the if branch. So at index i, the frequency is the total frequency of the element in the entire array minus the number of times we have encountered the element so far? \n\n          Actually, no: the frequency we set at the beginning is the entire array. Then when we process an occurrence, we decrement. So at index i, the frequency we have for an element is the frequency in the entire array minus the number of times we have encountered the element in indices 0 to i-1? \n\n          Then the frequency at index i is the frequency in the subarray [i, n-1]. \n\n          Therefore, (n-i) >= frequency, so (n-i) - frequency >= 0.\n\n          So res is nonnegative.\n\n        But what if n=0? Then we don't read any numbers. Then res=0.\n\n        So the second program: \n            x = res, which is nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute gcd(360, res) without worrying about negative? But our gcd function will take absolute value.\n\n        However, note: 360 is positive.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll write a gcd function that works for nonnegative numbers? But we are taking absolute value.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We'll read n and m. Even if m is unused, we read it.\n\n          Then we read n integers.\n\n          Then we build a hash table for the entire array (for frequencies).\n\n          Then we compute res.\n\n          Then we compute: \n                long g = gcd(360, res);\n                long result = 360 / g;\n\n          Then print result.\n\n        Let's test with the example: [1,2,1] as the first program.\n\n          Example: \n            n=3, m? we don't care. \n            lst = [1,2,1]\n\n          Build frequency: \n             1:2, 2:1.\n\n          i=0: \n             key=1, freq=2 -> if branch: res += (3-0) - 2 = 1; then update frequency: 1 becomes 1.\n          i=1:\n             key=2, freq=1 -> else branch: res += 3-1-1 = 1; total res=2.\n          i=2:\n             key=1, freq=1 -> else branch: res += 3-2-1 = 0; total res=2.\n\n          Then the second program: \n                x=2\n                gcd(360,2)=2\n                360//2 = 180.\n\n          Output: 180.\n\n        But the first program in Python for [1,2,1] would output 2? Then the second program would read 2 and output 180.\n\n        So the final output is 180.\n\n        We write the C program accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll implement a hash table for long integers (for the keys) and integer counts.\n\n          We'll define:\n\n            #define MOD 1000003\n\n            struct node {\n                long key;\n                int count;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            struct node* table[MOD];\n\n          Functions for the hash table:\n\n            int get_hash(long key) {\n                long h = key % MOD;\n                if (h < 0) h += MOD;\n                return (int)h;\n            }\n\n            void insert(long key, int count) {\n                int idx = get_hash(key);\n                struct node* p = table[idx];\n                while (p) {\n                    if (p->key == key) {\n                        p->count = count;   // actually, we are going to update? But we want to add to the count? \n                        return;\n                    }\n                    p = p->next;\n                }\n                // not found: create new node\n                struct node* new_node = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));\n                new_node->key = key;\n                new_node->count = count;\n                new_node->next = table[idx];\n                table[idx] = new_node;\n            }\n\n            // But we need to update: we want to set the count to a specific value? \n            // Actually, we might not know if the key exists? So we need a function to update the count for a key to a new value.\n\n            // However, we can also have a function to get the count and then update.\n\n            // Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            struct node* find(long key) {\n                int idx = get_hash(key);\n                struct node* p = table[idx];\n                while (p) {\n                    if (p->key == key) {\n                        return p;\n                    }\n                    p = p->next;\n                }\n                return NULL;\n            }\n\n            // Then we can:\n            //   When building: for each element, we try to find it. If found, we increment the count. Else, we set count=1.\n\n            // Then for updating: we can use find and then set the count.\n\n          Steps for building the frequency:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                struct node* p = find(lst[i]);\n                if (p) {\n                    p->count++;\n                } else {\n                    insert(lst[i], 1);\n                }\n            }\n\n          But note: we might have inserted already? Actually, we traverse the array and for each element, we either insert (if not exists) with count=1 or update the existing by incrementing.\n\n          Then during the second pass:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                struct node* p = find(lst[i]);\n                if (!p) {\n                    // This should not happen because we inserted all.\n                    // So we skip? Or error?\n                    // Actually, we built the frequency for every element, so it must exist.\n                    // So we can assume p is not NULL.\n                    // else: use the else branch? But the frequency is 0? Then we use the else branch: res += n-i-1.\n                    // But the element must be present. So we can break or something.\n                    // We'll set frequency to 0? Then the else branch.\n                    int freq = 0;\n                    if (p) {\n                        freq = p->count;\n                    }\n                    if (freq > 1) {\n                        // ... update\n                    } else {\n                        res += n - i - 1;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    int freq = p->count;\n                    if (freq > 1) {\n                        res += (n - i) - freq;\n                        p->count = freq - 1;   // update the frequency for the next\n                    } else {\n                        res += n - i - 1;\n                        // do not update the frequency? \n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n          But note: the else branch (when p is not found) should not happen.\n\n        We'll assume that every element is in the table.\n\n        Alternatively, we can initialize the table for each element to 0? Then update? But we build the table by traversing.\n\n        Actually, we build the table by inserting every element at least once. So every element must be found.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the check for p==NULL.\n\n        Code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                struct node* p = find(lst[i]);\n                int freq = p->count;\n                if (freq > 1) {\n                    res += (n - i) - freq;\n                    p->count = freq - 1;\n                } else {\n                    res += n - i - 1;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: what if the frequency is 0? Then we do the else branch? But that should not happen because we built the frequency from the entire array and we are updating only by decrementing. And we start with at least 1.\n\n        However, if an element appears only once, then at the time we process it, the frequency is 1 -> else branch.\n\n        If an element appears multiple times, then the first time we see it, frequency is >=2 -> if branch, then we decrement. The next time we see the same element, the frequency is the previous frequency minus one (so if originally 2, then becomes 1) -> else branch? But then we don't update? So the frequency remains 1 for the next occurrence? But there shouldn't be a next occurrence? \n\n        Actually, for an element that appears k times:\n\n            We see it at indices i1, i2, ... ik.\n\n            At i1: frequency = k (if we haven't updated) -> but wait: we built the frequency for the entire array, so at the beginning the frequency for the element is k.\n\n            Then at index i1: we update the frequency to k-1 (if k>1) and then at index i2: we look up and get k-1.\n\n            So for the j-th occurrence (j from 1 to k-1): we use frequency = k - j + 1? \n\n            Then at the last occurrence (j=k): we get frequency = 1 -> else branch.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        We must free the hash table? But the program ends, so we can skip.\n\n        Now, the entire program:\n\n          Steps:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <math.h>   // not needed? we don't use math functions.\n\n            #define MOD 1000003\n\n            struct node {\n                long key;\n                int count;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            struct node* table[MOD];\n\n            long gcd(long a, long b) {\n                a = a > 0 ? a : -a;\n                b = b > 0 ? b : -b;\n                while (b != 0) {\n                    long temp = b;\n                    b = a % b;\n                    a = temp;\n                }\n                return a;\n            }\n\n            int get_hash(long key) {\n                long h = key % MOD;\n                if (h < 0) h += MOD;\n                return (int)h;\n            }\n\n            struct node* find(long key) {\n                int idx = get_hash(key);\n                struct node* p = table[idx];\n                while (p != NULL) {\n                    if (p->key == key) {\n                        return p;\n                    }\n                    p = p->next;\n                }\n                return NULL;\n            }\n\n            void insert(long key, int count) {\n                int idx = get_hash(key);\n                struct node* new_node = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));\n                new_node->key = key;\n                new_node->count = count;\n                new_node->next = table[idx];\n                table[idx] = new_node;\n            }\n\n            int main() {\n                // Initialize the hash table: set all buckets to NULL.\n                for (int i = 0; i < MOD; i++) {\n                    table[i] = NULL;\n                }\n\n                int n, m;\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n                long *lst = (long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%ld\", &lst[i]);\n                }\n\n                // Build frequency table for the entire array\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    struct node* p = find(lst[i]);\n                    if (p != NULL) {\n                        p->count++;\n                    } else {\n                        insert(lst[i], 1);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                long res = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    struct node* p = find(lst[i]);\n                    // p should not be NULL\n                    int freq = p->count;\n                    if (freq > 1) {\n                        res += (long)(n - i) - (long)freq;\n                        p->count = freq - 1;\n                    } else {\n                        res += (n - i - 1);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Now, res is the result of the first program.\n                // Then we compute the second program:\n\n                long g = gcd(360, res);\n                long result = 360 / g;\n\n                printf(\"%ld\\n\", result);\n\n                // Free the memory? \n                // We can free the hash table and the array.\n\n                // Free the hash table\n                for (int i = 0; i < MOD; i++) {\n                    struct node* p = table[i];\n                    while (p != NULL) {\n                        struct node* temp = p;\n                        p = p->next;\n                        free(temp);\n                    }\n                }\n                free(lst);\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But note: the second program: \n            It does: 360 // gcd(360, x) -> integer division.\n\n        And we do: 360 / g, which is integer division because both 360 and g are integers.\n\n        However, if g is 0? \n            gcd(360, res) is never 0? Because gcd(360,0)=360, then 360/360=1.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Let's test with the example: [1,2,1] -> res=2, then gcd(360,2)=2, then 360/2=180.\n\n        Another example: n=0? \n            Then we read n=0, m=0, then no numbers. Then the array is empty.\n            Then the first loop (building frequency) does nothing.\n            Then the second loop: from i=0 to n-1 (which is 0 times) -> res=0.\n            Then gcd(360,0)=360 -> 360/360=1 -> output 1.\n\n        The original first program for n=0 would output 0? Then the second program would read 0 and output 360//gcd(360,0)=360//360=1.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        However, note: the first program for n=0: \n            n, m = 0,0\n            lst = list() -> empty.\n            l = {}\n            for i in range(0): nothing -> res=0 -> print(0)\n\n        Then second program: \n            x=0 -> 360 // gcd(360,0) = 360 // 360 = 1 -> output 1.\n\n        So the final output is 1.\n\n        Therefore, the C program for n=0 outputs 1.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But note: the first program uses n and m. The m is not used. So we read it and ignore.\n\n        We assume the input format: first two integers n and m, then n integers.\n\n        We'll write accordingly.\n\n        Note: the numbers in the list can be large? We use long for the list and for the keys.\n\n        Why long? The problem does not specify the range of the integers. In Python, integers can be big, but the first program uses them as keys. In C, we use long to be safe? Or long long? \n\n        The problem: the second program uses an integer x which is the output of the first program. The first program: the value of res is computed as:\n\n            res += (n-i) - freq   [for the if branch] or n-i-1.\n\n        The maximum value of res: worst-case, the first program:\n\n            In the else branch: n-i-1: the sum over i: \n                i=0: n-1\n                i=1: n-2\n                ... \n                i=n-1: 0\n\n            So the else branch total: sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-1-i) = n*(n-1)/2.\n\n            In the if branch: (n-i) - freq: worst-case, if the entire array is the same element? \n                Then for the first element: freq = n -> then (n-0) - n = 0.\n                Then for the second: freq = n-1 -> (n-1) - (n-1) = 0.\n                ... \n                So total=0.\n\n            But if the array has distinct elements? Then we are always in the else branch: total = n*(n-1)/2.\n\n            So the maximum res is O(n^2). n can be up to 10^5? Then n^2 = 10^10, which is within long (if long is 64-bit? but in C, long can be 32-bit on Windows). \n\n        To be safe, we use long long for res? \n\n        But the second program: gcd(360, res) -> res might be large? The gcd algorithm is efficient (O(log(min(360,res)))). So it's safe.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the constraints. So to avoid overflow, we use long long for res and for the list? \n\n        The problem: the list values? The first program uses them as keys. They can be large? We are using long for the keys. But if the keys are beyond 64-bit? Then our hash table won't work. But the problem does not specify.\n\n        We assume the keys are within 64-bit.\n\n        But for the res, we use long long? \n\n        Let me change:\n\n          We'll use long long for the list and for the keys? But the frequency counts are integers (n is integer). \n\n          However, the keys in the list: the problem says integers, so they can be long long? \n\n          We'll use long long for the keys and for the array.\n\n          Then the gcd function: we change to long long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use long long for the entire program? Because the res might be as large as 10^10 (if n=10^5, then n*(n-1)/2 = 5e9) which fits in long long.\n\n        We'll change:\n\n            long long *lst = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n\n            and\n\n            struct node {\n                long long key;\n                int count;\n                struct node* next;\n            };\n\n            and update the functions accordingly.\n\n        Then the gcd function for long long.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We change the gcd function to:\n\n            long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n                a = a > 0 ? a : -a;\n                b = b > 0 ? b : -b;\n                while (b != 0) {\n                    long long temp = b;\n                    b = a % b;\n                    a = temp;\n                }\n                return a;\n            }\n\n          And the hash functions: we change to long long.\n\n          And the res: long long.\n\n        But note: the first program: the res is an integer that the second program reads. The second program uses x = res. Then the second program uses integer arithmetic? But the gcd function we defined for long long? \n\n        It's okay because the numbers are integers.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            long long res = 0;\n\n            ...\n\n            long long g = gcd(360, res);\n            long long result = 360 / g;\n\n        But 360 is an integer, and res is long long? Then the gcd function will work.\n\n        However, note: 360 is small. The gcd(360, res) is the same as gcd(360, res % 360)? We don't need to, but the algorithm is efficient.\n\n        Now, the final code:\n\n          We use long long for keys and for res.\n\n          We also note: the first program: the list elements can be negative? The problem says integers. So we handle negative in the hash function.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: the modulus for the hash function: we use MOD=1000003. We do:\n\n            long long h = key % MOD;\n            if (h < 0) h += MOD;\n\n        Then return (int)h.\n\n        But if key is very negative? We do modulo which is defined as the remainder (can be negative). Then we adjust to [0, MOD-1].\n\n        We'll write the program.\n\n        But note: the input and output for the first part: we read n, m (integers) and then n long long integers.\n\n        The output: the second program's result: which is 360 divided by gcd(360,res). This is an integer and we print it as long long? But it's at most 360. So we can print as %lld? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the result is at most 360 (if gcd=1) and at least 1. So it fits in int. But we use long long for consistency? \n\n        We'll print with %lld.\n\n        However, the problem says the second program prints an integer. So we can use %d if the result is small? But to be safe, we use long long.\n\n        But the result is an integer between 1 and 360? So we can use int for the result? \n\n        But let's keep long long for the result? It doesn't matter.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            long long g = gcd(360, res);   // gcd(360, res) is at most 360? \n            int result = 360 / (int)g;   // because g divides 360, so it's integer.\n\n        But what if g is 0? It won't be.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            long long g = gcd(360, res);\n            long long result = 360 / g;\n\n        Then printf(\"%lld\\n\", result);\n\n        We are done.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Note: the hash table: we are using MOD=1000003. The distinct keys might be up to n (which can be 10^5) so the hash table is efficient.\n\n        We assume n can be up to 10^5.\n\n        We write the program.\n\n        We also note: the first program: the array 'lst' is stored and then we free it.\n\n        We free the hash table and the array.\n\n        We'll write the entire C program."
