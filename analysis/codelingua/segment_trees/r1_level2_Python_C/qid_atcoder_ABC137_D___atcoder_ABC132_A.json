We'll have:\n\n                heap_x: \n                    struct node_x *heap_x;\n                    int size_x;\n\n                heap_y:\n                    int *heap_y;\n                    int size_y;\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            void push_x(struct node_x element);\n            struct node_x pop_x();\n\n            void push_y(int element);\n            int pop_y();\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n, m.\n\n            Initialize heap_x: size=0, allocate memory? For i in 0 to n-1:\n                read day, salary\n                push_x( ( -day, -salary )   // note: negative\n\n            Initialize heap_y: size=0.\n\n            while (size_x > 0):\n                struct node_x job = pop_x();\n                int day = -job.neg_day;\n                int salary = -job.neg_salary;\n                int r = m - size_y;\n\n                if (r >= day) {\n                    push_y(salary);\n                } else {\n                    push_y(salary);\n                    pop_y();   // remove the smallest salary? \n                } Then total_salary = sum of heap_y? But we can maintain a running total? Alternatively, we can traverse heap_y? However, we are popping and pushing? We can also maintain the total sum? But note: when we push and then pop in the else branch? Actually, we can do:\n\n                total += salary;\n                push_y(salary);\n                if we are in the else branch, then we pop the smallest? and then total -= popped_value. But wait: we push and then pop? so:\n\n                total = total + salary;\n                then we pop the smallest? and subtract that. Alternatively, we can avoid the total variable by computing the sum at the end? How? We can store the heap_y and then iterate? But we are building the heap_y? and we don't want to destroy it? We can maintain an array? Actually, we can simply compute the sum by:\n\n                total = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<size_y; i++) {\n                    total += heap_y[i];   // but wait: the heap is stored in an array? but the array is not sorted? \n                } We cannot do that because the heap is stored in a structure that is not sorted? We can maintain a separate variable: \n\n                long long total_salary = 0;\n\n                Then:\n\n                    if (r >= day) {\n                        push_y(salary);\n                        total_salary += salary;\n                    } else {\n                        push_y(salary);\n                        total_salary += salary;\n                        int small = pop_y(); total_salary -= small;\n                    }\n\n            This is efficient? But note: we are going to push and then pop? so we can combine:\n\n            if (r >= day) {\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n            } else {\n                // We push the salary, then pop the smallest? \n                // But note: the smallest in the heap might be smaller than the current salary? \n                // So we are effectively replacing the smallest job in the heap with the current job? // How to do? \n                push_y(salary); total_salary += salary;\n                int small = pop_y();\n                total_salary -= small;\n            } But we can also do:\n\n            if (r >= day) {\n                // just add\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n            } else {\n                // Check if the current salary is greater than the smallest in the heap? \n                // Actually, we don't need to check: we always push and then pop the smallest? \n                //",

But then the second program: \n                \"1122\" -> distinct: '1' and '2'? \n                counts: '1':2, '2':2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n=2, m=2. Build heap_x: \n                job1: (-1, -1122)\n                job2: (-1, 0)   -> but note: we push (-1, -0) -> but 0 is 0. Then pop from heap_x: we get the one with the smallest neg_day? both have -1? then compare neg_salary: -1122 and 0? -> -1122 is smaller? so we pop job1 first? Then:\n                job1: day=1, salary=1122. r = 2 - 0 = 2 >= 1 -> push 1122 -> heap_y: [1122], total_salary=1122. Then pop next job: \n                job2: (-1,0) -> day=1, salary=0. r = 2 - 1 = 1 >= 1 -> push 0 -> heap_y: [0,1122] -> but the min-heap will be [0,1122]? total_salary = 1122+0 = 1122. Then we output 1122. Then we convert to string: \"1122\", then check: \n                distinct: '1' and '2'? \n                counts: \n                    '1':2, '2':2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        So our program should output \"Yes\". However, note: the heap for x: when two jobs have the same day, we break by neg_salary?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to translate the entire sequence of two Python programs into a single C program.\n The first program reads:\n   n, m\n   then n lines, each with two integers: day and salary\n\n The second program reads a string S.\n\n However, note: the output of the first program is an integer (the sum of the heap y) and that becomes the input for the second program?\n But wait: the second program reads a string. This is a problem because the first program outputs an integer and the second expects a string.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n   \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n But the first program outputs an integer (print(sum(y))), and the second program expects a string (S = input()).\n\n This is a type mismatch. However, in the problem statement, we are to reproduce the same behavior. \n\n How were these programs intended to be run? \n   The first program reads from stdin and writes an integer to stdout.\n   The second program reads from stdin (which now would be the integer from the first program) and then processes it.\n\n But the second program expects a string of exactly 4 characters (since it checks that there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice). \n However, the output of the first program is an integer, which when printed is a string of digits. \n\n For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would read the string \"123\". \n But then the second program would check:\n   len(set(\"123\")) -> which is 3, so it would output \"No\".\n\n However, the original chain might not be intended this way? Or perhaps the problem is that the two programs are independent? \n\n But the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the input to the second program is the string representation of the integer output by the first.\n\n Therefore, we must design the C program to:\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, m and the n lines of pairs).\n   Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (an integer, say `result1`).\n   Step 3: Convert `result1` to a string (so we have a string representation of the integer) and use that as the input for the second program.\n\n But note: the second program expects a string. However, the second program in the example does:\n   S = input()\n   then checks: if the set of S has exactly 2 distinct characters and each appears exactly 2 times.\n\n However, the integer we output in the first program is a number, which when printed is a string of digits. \n How many distinct digits can there be? And how many times each? It's arbitrary.\n\n But the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n So the chain in the original would be:\n   $ python3 file1.py < input.txt | python3 file2.py\n\n And the output of the entire chain would be either \"No\" or \"Yes\".\n\n Therefore, in our C program, we must:\n   - Read the input for the first program (n, m and the n pairs).\n   - Process the first program to get an integer result.\n   - Convert that integer to a string (so we have a sequence of characters, without any extra spaces or newlines? note: the print in the first program does not include a newline? Actually, in Python print adds a newline by default. But the second program's input would then have a newline at the end? Actually, the second program's input is the entire output of the first, which is the integer and a newline.\n\n However, the second program reads the entire line? It does input(), which reads a line. So the string S includes the digits and the newline? Actually, no: because the first program prints the integer and a newline, so the second program would read the integer as a string without the trailing newline? Actually, the input() function in Python strips the trailing newline.\n\n But in the second program, if we have the string \"123\\n\", then input() returns \"123\". So we are safe.\n\n However, in C, we have to simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Read the first input (n, m and then n pairs of integers).\n   Step 2: Compute the first program's result (an integer).\n   Step 3: Then, we want to run the second program with input being the string representation of that integer (with no extra newline? but note: the second program expects one line). Actually, the second program reads one line.\n\n But note: the second program does not require any more input? So we have to form a string that is the integer converted to string, and then process that string.\n\n How the second program works:\n   It checks:\n     1. The string must have exactly two distinct characters.\n     2. Each distinct character must appear exactly two times.\n\n However, the integer we get from the first program is arbitrary. For example, it might be 0, 10, 100, etc.\n\n Let's consider: \n   If the integer is 0 -> string \"0\": \n        distinct characters: {'0'} -> length 1 -> fails -> output \"No\"\n   If the integer is 11: \n        distinct characters: {'1'} -> length 1 -> fails? But wait, the string is \"11\", so distinct set is {'1'} -> length 1 -> fails.\n   If the integer is 1122: \n        distinct characters: {'1','2'} -> length 2 -> then check counts: \n            '1': 2, '2': 2 -> passes -> output \"Yes\"\n\n So the second program will output \"Yes\" only if the integer from the first program is a number that when written in base 10 has exactly two distinct digits and each digit appears exactly twice.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m, then n pairs (day, salary). Then simulate the min-heap (but note: the Python program uses negative values to simulate max-heap) and the algorithm.\n\n   Step 2: Convert the integer result to a string.\n\n   Step 3: Check the string:\n        - Count distinct characters: must be 2.\n        - The length of the string must be 4? Actually, no: it must be 4 because two distinct digits each appearing twice -> total 4. But what if the number has leading zeros? \n          However, the first program outputs an integer. When we print an integer, we don't get leading zeros. So the string representation of the integer is without leading zeros.\n\n        So the string must have exactly 4 characters? Actually, no: consider 1111: \n            distinct set: {'1'} -> fails.\n\n        But note: the condition is:\n            if the number of distinct characters != 2 -> \"No\"\n            else, for each distinct character, if the count != 2 -> \"No\"\n\n        So for 1122: \n            distinct: 2, and counts: each 2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        For 1112: \n            distinct: 2, but '1' appears 3 times -> fails.\n\n        For 12: \n            distinct: 2, but each appears 1 time -> fails.\n\n        For 112233: \n            distinct: 3 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the string must be of length 4? Actually, the condition does not require the string to be of length 4? \n        It requires exactly two distinct characters and each exactly two times. So the total length must be 4.\n\n        However, the integer might be negative? The first program: \n            We have negative day and negative salary? But then we push negative of salary? \n            The first program: \n                heapq.heappush(x, (-day, -salary))\n                then pops: d, s = heapq.heappop(x) -> so d is -day, s is -salary.\n\n            Then we do: \n                r = m - len(y)\n                if r >= -d:   -> so -d is day (positive)\n                we push -s (which is salary) into y.\n\n            Then at the end: print(sum(y)) -> which is the sum of positive salaries.\n\n            So the integer is nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have negative numbers in the output.\n\n        So the string is composed of digits only, and without any sign.\n\n        Now, what if the integer is 0? -> \"0\": length=1 -> distinct=1 -> \"No\".\n        What if the integer is 1001? -> distinct: {'1','0'} -> two distinct, and counts: \n            '1':2, '0':2 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the string \"1001\" has length 4, but the counts are: \n            '1': at positions 0 and 3 -> 2 times\n            '0': at positions 1 and 2 -> 2 times.\n\n        So it passes.\n\n        However, the integer 1001 is a four-digit number. But the condition does not require the string to be of length 4? \n        Actually, the condition: \n            for each distinct character i in the string, c[i] must be 2.\n\n        That implies the total length is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\n        So the string must be of length 4? But what if the integer is 11? Then the string is \"11\", which has length 2? \n        Then distinct set has one element? -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will only output \"Yes\" if the integer from the first program is a 4-digit number with exactly two distinct digits, each appearing twice.\n\n        However, note: the integer 1001 is a four-digit number, but the integer 0 is one-digit, 10 is two-digit, 100 is three-digit, 1000 is four-digit (but distinct digits: '1' and '0', but '1' appears once and '0' three times) -> fails.\n\n        So the conditions are:\n            - The string must have exactly 4 characters? Actually, no: the condition doesn't require 4 characters? It requires two distinct characters and each appears twice. So the length must be 4.\n\n        But note: the integer 1001 is represented as \"1001\", which has 4 characters. The integer 11 is represented as \"11\", which has 2 characters. \n\n        So the second program will only say \"Yes\" for integers that when written in base 10 without leading zeros (which is the natural representation) have exactly 4 digits and two distinct digits, each appearing twice.\n\n        However, what about 1010? -> distinct: '1' and '0', each appears twice? -> \"Yes\".\n\n        So we don't require the digits to be consecutive.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read n pairs (day, salary). We'll store them in an array.\n\n   But note: the first program uses a heap (min-heap) for x, and then processes by popping from x. \n        It pushes the negative of day and negative of salary. Why? \n        Because heapq in Python is a min-heap. By pushing (-day, -salary), we are effectively making a max-heap by day? \n        Actually, the heap orders by the first element (then by the second). So we want to process the jobs with the largest day first? \n        But the condition: \n            if r >= -d: \n            where r = m - current size of y (which is the number of remaining days we can assign jobs to)\n\n        The algorithm:\n\n            We have a heap x that we built by pushing (-day, -salary) for each job.\n\n            Then we pop from x: the smallest element by (-day, -salary) is the one with the largest day (because -day is smallest when day is largest) and then same for salary? \n\n            Actually, the heap is ordered by day descending? Then within same day by salary descending?\n\n            Then for each job (popped in descending order by day):\n\n                r = m - len(y)   [y is a min-heap of salaries we have chosen? but note: we are pushing the salary (positive) and then we are going to pop the smallest salary?]\n\n                If we have at least (current day) remaining days? Actually, the condition: if r >= -d? \n                    Since d is negative of day, so -d is the day (positive). \n                    So: if the remaining available days (r) is at least the day of the job? \n\n                Then we push the salary (which is -s) into y? But note: we have s = -salary, so -s = salary.\n\n                Else, we push the salary and then pop the smallest from y? \n\n            Why? \n\n            Actually, we are trying to assign the job to be done on one of the last 'day' days? \n\n            We are going backwards in time? \n\n            The algorithm is a greedy algorithm for job scheduling? \n\n            We are limited by the fact that we can only do one job per day, and we have m days (from day 0 to m-1? or day 1 to m?).\n\n            The job with day = d must be scheduled in the last d days? \n\n            We are processing jobs in descending order of day. \n\n            We maintain a min-heap y for the salaries of the jobs we have chosen. \n\n            Initially, we have m available days.\n\n            For a job (d_i, s_i): \n                if the number of available days (r) is >= d_i, then we can assign this job? \n                But note: we are processing from the largest d_i to the smallest. \n\n            Actually, the algorithm:\n\n                We have a heap y (min-heap) that we are going to use to store the salaries of the jobs we have selected.\n\n                We traverse the jobs by descending day:\n\n                    Let r = m - len(y)   [number of days we haven't assigned a job?]\n\n                    If r >= d_i: then we can assign this job? But wait, the job requires that it must be done in the last d_i days? \n                    But we have r days left? and d_i is the requirement? \n\n                    Actually, we can assign a job with day d_i to any of the last d_i days? \n\n                    However, we are going to assign it to one of the available days? \n\n                    If we have at least d_i available days? That doesn't seem right: because we have r available days, and we require that we assign the job to one of the last d_i days? \n\n                    Actually, the constraint: a job with day d_i must be done in the last d_i days (so we have d_i available slots that are the last d_i days). But we might have already assigned some of those slots? \n\n                    How does the algorithm work? \n\n                    We are processing the jobs that require the largest day first. \n\n                    The idea: we have m days. We can assign at most one job per day. \n\n                    A job i can only be scheduled on days from m - d_i to m-1? \n\n                    But note: the job requires that it must be done in the last d_i days? \n\n                    We are going backwards from the last day to the first? \n\n                    We have a heap for the current selected jobs. \n\n                    We start by considering the jobs with the largest d_i. \n\n                    We have r = m - len(y) available days. \n\n                    Condition: if the available days (r) is >= d_i? \n\n                    But wait: if we have a job that requires the last 5 days, and we have 5 available days, then we can assign it? \n\n                    However, if we have a job that requires the last 5 days, and we have 4 available days, we cannot assign it? \n\n                    But then the algorithm does:\n\n                        if r >= d_i: \n                            we push s_i into y.\n                        else:\n                            we push s_i and then pop the smallest from y.\n\n                    Why pop the smallest? \n\n                    Actually, we are maintaining the invariant that we have at most m jobs? \n\n                    But note: we are only going to assign at most m jobs? \n\n                    However, the condition \"if r >= d_i\" is not about the total days but the current available days? \n\n                    This algorithm is known as the \"scheduling with deadlines\" greedy? \n\n                    We are going to assign the job regardless? But then if we exceed the available days, we remove the job with the smallest salary? \n\n                    Actually, we push the current job and then we pop the smallest? \n\n                    Why? \n\n                    Because we want to keep the highest paying jobs? \n\n                    We are going to assign the job to one of the last d_i days? \n\n                    But we have already assigned some jobs to the last d_i days? \n\n                    We are processing by descending day? \n\n                    We are maintaining a min-heap of the salaries of the jobs we have selected. \n\n                    The size of the heap is the number of jobs we have selected? \n\n                    When we have a new job, we assign it? Then if the number of jobs we have selected becomes more than the number of days that are available for the jobs with the same or larger day? \n\n                    Actually, the algorithm:\n\n                        We are processing by day descending. \n\n                        We are going to assign the job? \n\n                        But if the available days (r) is less than the current job's day? \n\n                        Then we push the job's salary and then pop the smallest? \n\n                        This means we are replacing the job with the smallest salary in the current set? \n\n                    Why? \n\n                    Because we are trying to maximize the total salary? \n\n                    The goal is to assign jobs such that we maximize the total salary? \n\n                    The first program outputs the total salary? \n\n                    So the algorithm:\n\n                        We want to select a set of jobs that we can schedule without violating the deadline constraints? \n\n                        The constraint: a job with deadline d_i must be scheduled in the last d_i days? \n\n                        We process jobs in descending order of d_i? \n\n                        We maintain a min-heap for the salaries of the selected jobs? \n\n                        Initially, we have m days. \n\n                        For each job:\n\n                            If the current number of selected jobs is less than d_i? \n\n                            Actually, the condition: if the available days (r) is >= d_i? \n\n                            Why? \n\n                            The job with deadline d_i requires that we assign it to one of the last d_i days. \n\n                            How many jobs have we already assigned that are scheduled in the last d_i days? \n\n                            Actually, we are processing by descending deadline. \n\n                            The jobs we have already processed have deadlines >= d_i? \n\n                            Therefore, they also require to be scheduled in the last (at least d_i) days? \n\n                            So the jobs we have selected are all scheduled in the last d_i days? \n\n                            But we are going to assign at most one job per day? \n\n                            So the number of jobs we have selected that are scheduled in the last d_i days is at most d_i? \n\n                            Actually, we can assign at most d_i jobs to the last d_i days? \n\n                            But note: we are going to assign the current job to the last d_i days? \n\n                            The condition: if the total available days (r) is at least d_i? \n\n                            This condition is not about the last d_i days? \n\n                            Actually, the condition is: if the total available days (r) is at least d_i? \n\n                            Then we assign the job? \n\n                            But what if we have already assigned some jobs to the last d_i days? \n\n                            The algorithm does not reserve the last d_i days for the job? \n\n                            This algorithm is known as the \"reverse greedy\" for scheduling? \n\n                        Actually, a better way: \n\n                            We have a set of days {0,1,...,m-1}. \n\n                            A job i has deadline d_i meaning it must be scheduled in one of the days in [m - d_i, m-1]? \n\n                            We want to select a set of jobs to maximize the total salary? \n\n                            The algorithm:\n\n                                Sort the jobs by deadline descending. \n\n                                Then, for each job (starting with the largest deadline):\n\n                                    Let t = min(deadline, m)   [but deadline might be larger than m? then we use m]\n\n                                    Then, we can assign the job to any day in the interval [m - t, m-1]? \n\n                                    Actually, we are going to assign the job to the last t days? \n\n                                    But we are going to assign as many as t jobs? \n\n                                    However, we are limited by the total days m? \n\n                                    We have a heap for the salaries we have selected? \n\n                                    We are going to assign the job? \n\n                                    Then if the current number of selected jobs is less than t? we assign? \n\n                                    But the algorithm does:\n\n                                        r = m - len(y)   [total available days?]\n\n                                        if r >= t? then assign? \n\n                                    Actually, the condition: if the number of available days (r) is >= t? \n\n                                    But t is the deadline? \n\n                                    This condition doesn't seem to match? \n\n                        Alternatively, we can note that the algorithm is from: \n                          \"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling-log-n-time/\"\n\n                        But actually, I recall a classic greedy: \n\n                          Sort jobs by deadline ascending? \n\n                        This one sorts by deadline descending? \n\n                    After research: it's a variant of \"scheduling to minimize the maximum delay\" but here the constraint is that the job must be done in the last d_i days? \n\n                    However, we can simulate the algorithm as described:\n\n                        We maintain a min-heap y for the salaries of the selected jobs? \n\n                        We have a heap x that we built as a max-heap by day (because we push (-day, -salary)). \n\n                        Then we pop from x: so we get the job with the largest day first? \n\n                        For each job (d, s) (which we have stored as negative, so d = -day, s = -salary; then we get day = -d, salary = -s? Actually, we have:\n\n                            d = -day -> so day = -d\n                            s = -salary -> salary = -s\n\n                        Then:\n\n                            r = m - current_size_of_y\n\n                            if r >= day? (because -d is day) -> then we push salary into y? \n\n                            else: we push salary and then pop the smallest from y? \n\n                        Why? \n\n                        The condition: if the available days (r) is at least the day? \n\n                        But the day is the deadline? \n\n                        Then we assign the job? \n\n                        Otherwise, we assign the job and then remove the job with the smallest salary? \n\n                        This means we are going to assign the job, but then we remove the job with the smallest salary in the set? \n\n                        Why? \n\n                        Because we want to keep the set of jobs with the highest salaries? \n\n                        And we are going to have at most m jobs? \n\n                        Actually, the heap y will never exceed m? \n\n                        Because we start with 0, then we push and then if we exceed we pop? \n\n                        But note: the condition \"else\" does: push and then pop? so the size of y remains the same? \n\n                        In the \"if\" branch: we push and the size increases? \n\n                        In the \"else\" branch: we push and then pop -> so the size remains the same? \n\n                        So the heap y will have at most min(n, m) jobs? \n\n                        Actually, we start with 0, then:\n\n                            if r>=day: then we push -> size increases by 1.\n\n                            else: we push and pop -> size remains the same.\n\n                        Then we traverse all n jobs? \n\n                        Then the final heap y has min(n, m) jobs? \n\n                        But that doesn't sound right? \n\n                        Actually, the condition: r = m - len(y) -> the available days.\n\n                        So if we have available days >= the current job's deadline? \n\n                        But why compare the available days with the deadline? \n\n                        The deadline is the requirement that the job must be scheduled in the last day days? \n\n                        How many days are available in the last day days? \n\n                        Actually, the available days r is the total available days (all days) because we haven't assigned any day? \n\n                        But that doesn't make sense? \n\n                        After reading: \n\n                        The algorithm is from: \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/19/B\" \n\n                        The problem: \n                          There are n items. Each item has t_i (time) and c_i (cost). \n                          The cashier can scan at most one item per second. \n                          If an item is scanned at time T, then it must be that T >= t_i? \n                          Actually, the cashier starts at time 0. \n                          But if the cashier scans an item at time T, then the item must have t_i <= T? \n\n                        However, the problem in the code is: \n\n                          We have m? what is m? \n\n                        In our input: \n                          n, m\n\n                        Then n lines: day, salary.\n\n                        The variable m is the total time? \n\n                        The algorithm:\n\n                          We want to minimize the total cost? or maximize the total salary? \n\n                          Actually, the problem might be: we are a thief and we have m days? \n\n                        After reexamination: \n\n                          The algorithm: \n                            We are going to assign jobs to days? \n\n                            We have m days. \n\n                            Each job i has a deadline d_i: meaning it must be assigned to one of the last d_i days? \n\n                            And we get a salary s_i? \n\n                            We want to maximize the total salary? \n\n                            How? \n\n                            We process the jobs by descending deadline? \n\n                            We have a heap (min-heap) for the salaries we have selected? \n\n                            We start with the job that has the largest deadline? \n\n                            For a job i:\n\n                                If the number of available days (r) is at least d_i? \n                                    then we assign it? \n\n                                Otherwise, we compare the smallest salary in the heap with the current job's salary? \n\n                                But note: the algorithm doesn't compare? \n\n                                It unconditionally pushes the current job and then pops the smallest? \n\n                            Why? \n\n                            Because we want to have at most d_i jobs? \n\n                            Actually, the condition: we cannot assign more than d_i jobs to the last d_i days? \n\n                            But we are processing by descending deadline? \n\n                            The jobs we have already processed have deadlines >= d_i? \n\n                            So they are also assigned to the last d_i days? \n\n                            Therefore, the total number of jobs we assign to the last d_i days is the current heap size? \n\n                            We cannot assign more than d_i jobs to the last d_i days? \n\n                            So if we have already assigned d_i jobs to the last d_i days? then we have to remove one? \n\n                            But the condition: if the available days (r) is less than d_i? \n\n                            Actually, the available days r = m - len(y) is the total available days? \n\n                            That doesn't seem to be the same as the available days in the last d_i days? \n\n                        Alternatively, we can note that the algorithm is known as the \"greedy for scheduling with deadlines\" to maximize profit? \n\n                        Steps:\n\n                            Sort the jobs in decreasing order of deadline? \n\n                            Let current time = min(deadline, m)   [but the deadline might be larger than m? then we use m] \n\n                            Then we maintain a min-heap for the profits? \n\n                            Then we traverse jobs:\n\n                                if the current heap size < current time: \n                                    push the profit? \n                                else if the top of the heap < current profit: \n                                    pop and push the current? \n                                else: skip.\n\n                            But our algorithm does not have the comparison? \n\n                        Our algorithm:\n\n                            if r >= deadline: \n                                push the profit? \n                            else:\n                                push and then pop? \n\n                            This means we are going to push the job? and then if the heap size becomes deadline+1? then we pop? \n\n                            Actually, the condition: \n                                r = m - len(y)   [available days] \n                                if r >= deadline: then we push -> heap size increases by 1.\n                                else: we push and pop -> heap size remains the same.\n\n                            Why? \n\n                            Because we are not comparing the current job's salary with the top? \n\n                            That might be a bug? \n\n                            Actually, the classic algorithm uses a max-heap? and then we push the job and then if the heap size exceeds the current deadline, we pop the smallest? \n\n                            But here, we are using a min-heap? and we are always pushing the current job? and then popping the smallest? \n\n                            So we are effectively replacing the smallest job in the set with the current job if we exceed the available days? \n\n                            But the condition is not about the current deadline? but about the available days? \n\n                        However, note: the condition is: \n                            if the available days (r) is >= deadline? \n\n                            Why? \n\n                            The job requires that it must be scheduled in the last deadline days? \n\n                            The available days (r) is the total available days? \n\n                            How is that related? \n\n                        Actually, the available days r is the entire timeline? \n\n                        But the job doesn't require the entire timeline? \n\n                        This condition is not standard? \n\n                        After reading the problem: \n\n                          The problem is: \n                            \"There are n items.

We can use an array and sort? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a min-heap for x? but we push (-day, -salary). Then the top of the min-heap is the job with the smallest (-day) -> which is the largest day? \n\n   Then we process the jobs in descending order of day? \n\n   We need two heaps: \n        Heap x: min-heap for (-day, -salary) -> so we can get the largest day first? \n        Heap y: min-heap for salary? \n\n   How to implement heaps in C? \n\n        We can use arrays and write heapify, push, pop functions? \n\n        We'll implement a min-heap for x? but storing the negative day and negative salary? \n\n        Actually, we can store the day and salary as positive? and then for x we want a max-heap by day? \n\n        We can use a max-heap for x by day? \n\n        But we don't have a max-heap? \n\n        We can use a min-heap with negative day? \n\n        Similarly, for y: we want a min-heap for salary? \n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n, m.\n\n        Allocate an array for the jobs? \n\n        Build heap x: \n            We'll store: \n                struct job { int day; int salary; } \n            But then for the heap x, we want to compare by day descending? \n\n            We can store: \n                struct heap_element { int key1; int key2; }   // for x: key1 = -day, key2 = -salary\n\n            Then we build a min-heap on (key1, key2)? \n\n        Then:\n\n            while x is not empty:\n                pop the top of x -> gives us a job with the largest day? \n                let day = -key1, salary = -key2.\n\n                r = m - (size of y)\n\n                if r >= day: \n                    push salary into y (min-heap for salary? so we push salary as is? and then we can pop the smallest? \n                else:\n                    push salary into y, and then pop the smallest from y.\n\n            Then output the sum of all elements in y.\n\n   Step 3: Convert the total salary (an integer) to a string? \n\n        We need to convert the integer to a string without a newline? \n\n        But note: the second program expects one line? \n\n        Then we simulate the second program:\n\n            We have a string S (which is the integer as a string) -> we need to check:\n\n                Count the distinct characters in S? \n                Also, check the frequency of each distinct character? \n\n            Conditions:\n                If the number of distinct characters != 2 -> print \"No\"\n                Else, for each distinct character, if the frequency != 2 -> print \"No\"\n                Otherwise, print \"Yes\"\n\n        But note: the integer might be 0? then the string \"0\" -> distinct set has one element -> \"No\"\n\n        Also, note: the string might have a length not equal to 4? then we can break early? \n\n        However, the condition does not require the length to be 4? but the frequency condition requires that each distinct character appears twice, so the total length must be 4? \n\n        Actually, no: if the string has two distinct characters, and each appears twice, then the length is 4. \n\n        Therefore, we can also check the length? \n\n        But the condition is independent: \n            if (number of distinct != 2) -> \"No\"\n            else: \n                for each distinct char: \n                    if count != 2 -> \"No\"\n                then \"Yes\"\n\n        So we don't need to check the length? \n\n        However, if the length is not 4, then we know it fails? \n\n        But we can do:\n\n            If the length is not 4, then we can output \"No\" without counting? \n\n        But the problem: \n            The integer 10000 -> string \"10000\" -> length 5 -> distinct: '1' and '0', but counts: '1':1, '0':4 -> fails the second condition.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Step 1: if the string length != 4, then output \"No\".\n            Step 2: else, check distinct characters: must be 2? \n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"1111\"? \n            length=4, distinct=1 -> fails.\n\n        Or \"1122\": distinct=2 -> then check counts: each 2 -> passes.\n\n        But note: the condition in the Python program does not check the length? \n\n        The Python program:\n\n            S = input()\n            c = Counter(S)\n            Sa = set(list(S))\n            if len(Sa) != 2:\n                print(\"No\")\n                exit()\n            for i in Sa:\n                if c[i] != 2:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    exit()\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n        So it doesn't check the length? \n\n        But if the length is not 4, then the set of distinct characters might be 2? but then we will find a character that does not have count 2? \n\n        For example, \"100\": \n            set: {'1','0'} -> size 2 -> then check: \n                count('1') = 1 -> fails -> \"No\"\n\n        So we don't need to check the length? \n\n        However, we can optimize: if the length is not 4, we output \"No\". \n\n        But the condition is: the string must have two distinct characters and each must appear twice. \n\n        This implies the length is 4. \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (strlen(S) != 4) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                // then check distinct and counts\n            }\n\n        But the original program does not do that? \n\n        We must be faithful to the original? \n\n        The original program does not check the length? \n\n        But the original program will work: \n            For a string of length != 4: \n                if distinct count != 2 -> \"No\"\n                else: then check counts -> which will fail because 4 = 2+2, so if the length is not 4, then the counts cannot both be 2? \n\n            Actually, if the length is not 4, then the condition that two distinct characters each appears twice is impossible? \n\n            So we can do either? \n\n        However, to be safe, we do exactly as the original: \n\n            Step 1: Convert the integer to a string (without any extra characters, just the digits).\n\n            Step 2: Count the frequency of each character.\n\n            Step 3: Create a set (we can use an array of booleans for seen, and then a distinct array?).\n\n            But we know the string is digits? so only 0-9.\n\n        Steps for the second program:\n\n            char S[20]; // we'll convert the integer to a string. 20 digits should be enough.\n\n            int len = sprintf(S, \"%d\", total_salary);   // This writes the integer to S and returns the length.\n\n            Then:\n\n                int freq[10] = {0}; // for digits '0' to '9'\n\n                // Count frequency:\n                for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                    char c = S[i];\n                    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {\n                        freq[c-'0']++;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Now, we want to know the distinct characters that appear? \n                // But note: we are only interested in the ones that appear? \n\n                // We can count the distinct characters? \n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                    printf(\"No\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    // Check that for each distinct digit, the frequency is 2.\n                    int valid = 1;\n                    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n                        if (freq[i] > 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                            valid = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (valid) {\n                        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"No\\n\");\n                    }\n                }\n\n        However, note: the original program uses the set of characters in the string. It doesn't use the entire set of digits? \n\n        But the frequency array we built is only for the digits that appear? \n\n        Actually, we are iterating over all digits 0-9? but we skip the ones with freq[i]==0? \n\n        So it's the same.\n\n        But the original program: \n            Sa = set(list(S))   -> which is the set of characters that appear.\n\n        So we are effectively doing the same.\n\n   Implementation of heaps:\n\n        We have two heaps: \n            Heap x: for the jobs, we want to extract the job with the largest day (and then largest salary? the Python code uses (-day, -salary) so for the same day, we get the largest salary first? because the heap in Python compares the second element if the first is equal? \n\n            So we need a min-heap for x: storing (key1, key2) = (-day, -salary). Then the top is the smallest key1, then smallest key2? \n\n            But we want: \n                Largest day: so we use -day to make the largest day become the smallest negative? \n                Then for same day, we want the largest salary? which becomes the smallest negative? \n\n            So we push (-day, -salary) and then pop.\n\n        We can implement a min-heap for x? \n\n        Similarly, for heap y: we want a min-heap for salary? \n\n        We'll write:\n\n            For heap_x: \n                We store elements of type: \n                    struct node_x { int neg_day; int neg_salary; };\n\n                Then we compare: \n                    if a.neg_day < b.neg_day -> then a should be above? \n                    else if a.neg_day == b.neg_day, then if a.neg_salary < b.neg_salary -> a above.\n\n            For heap_y: \n                We store int: the salary? \n                Then we want a min-heap: so the smallest salary at the top.\n\n        How to implement a heap? \n\n            We can use an array and maintain the heap property? \n\n            We'll have:\n\n                heap_x: \n                    struct node_x *heap_x;\n                    int size_x;\n\n                heap_y:\n                    int *heap_y;\n                    int size_y;\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            void push_x(struct node_x element);\n            struct node_x pop_x();\n\n            void push_y(int element);\n            int pop_y();\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n, m.\n\n            Initialize heap_x: size=0, allocate memory? \n\n            For i in 0 to n-1:\n                read day, salary\n                push_x( ( -day, -salary )   // note: negative\n\n            Initialize heap_y: size=0.\n\n            while (size_x > 0):\n                struct node_x job = pop_x();\n                int day = -job.neg_day;\n                int salary = -job.neg_salary;\n                int r = m - size_y;\n\n                if (r >= day) {\n                    push_y(salary);\n                } else {\n                    push_y(salary);\n                    pop_y();   // remove the smallest salary? \n                }\n\n            Then total_salary = sum of heap_y? \n\n            But we can maintain a running total? \n\n            Alternatively, we can traverse heap_y? \n\n            However, we are popping and pushing? \n\n            We can also maintain the total sum? \n\n            But note: when we push and then pop in the else branch? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                total += salary;\n                push_y(salary);\n                if we are in the else branch, then we pop the smallest? and then total -= popped_value.\n\n            But wait: we push and then pop? so:\n\n                total = total + salary;\n                then we pop the smallest? and subtract that.\n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid the total variable by computing the sum at the end? \n\n            How? \n\n            We can store the heap_y and then iterate? \n\n            But we are building the heap_y? and we don't want to destroy it? \n\n            We can maintain an array? \n\n            Actually, we can simply compute the sum by:\n\n                total = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<size_y; i++) {\n                    total += heap_y[i];   // but wait: the heap is stored in an array? but the array is not sorted? \n                }\n\n            We cannot do that because the heap is stored in a structure that is not sorted? \n\n            We can maintain a separate variable: \n\n                long long total_salary = 0;\n\n                Then:\n\n                    if (r >= day) {\n                        push_y(salary);\n                        total_salary += salary;\n                    } else {\n                        push_y(salary);\n                        total_salary += salary;\n                        int small = pop_y();\n                        total_salary -= small;\n                    }\n\n            This is efficient? \n\n        But note: we are going to push and then pop? so we can combine:\n\n            if (r >= day) {\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n            } else {\n                // We push the salary, then pop the smallest? \n                // But note: the smallest in the heap might be smaller than the current salary? \n                // So we are effectively replacing the smallest job in the heap with the current job? \n\n                // How to do? \n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n                int small = pop_y();\n                total_salary -= small;\n            }\n\n        But we can also do:\n\n            if (r >= day) {\n                // just add\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n            } else {\n                // Check if the current salary is greater than the smallest in the heap? \n                // Actually, we don't need to check: we always push and then pop the smallest? \n                // This has the effect of replacing the smallest with the current if the current is larger? but even if not, we do it? \n                // But that might reduce the total? \n\n                // However, the algorithm in the Python code does this unconditionally? \n\n                // But why? \n\n                // Example: \n                    We have a heap y: [10, 20, 30] -> size=3, and m=3, then r = 0.\n                    Then we have a new job: day=4, salary=5 -> then we push 5: [5,10,20,30] -> then pop the smallest: 5 -> then we are left with [10,20,30] -> total same? \n\n                // So it doesn't change? \n\n                // But if the new job has salary=40? \n                    Then we push 40: [10,20,30,40] -> then pop the smallest: 10 -> then we have [20,30,40] -> total increased by 30? \n\n                // So the algorithm always adds the current job? and then removes the smallest? \n\n                // This has the effect of replacing the smallest job in the heap with the current job? \n\n                // Why not compare and only replace if the current is larger? \n\n                // Actually, we are processing jobs in descending order of day? \n\n                // And we are maintaining the heap of the best salaries? \n\n                // The condition: if we have available days, we add the job? \n                // Otherwise, we add the job and then remove the smallest? \n\n                // This is equivalent to: we are going to assign the current job? and if we exceed the available days, we remove the job with the smallest salary? \n\n                // So we are always keeping the job? but then we remove the smallest one? \n\n                // The total salary might increase or decrease? \n\n                // But the algorithm is designed to maximize the total salary? \n\n                // It is safe to do? \n\n            So we do:\n\n                total_salary += salary;\n                push_y(salary);\n                if (r < day) {\n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n\n            Actually, note: in the if branch we don't pop, so we don't subtract. \n            In the else branch we do pop? \n\n            But the condition: \n                if (r >= day) -> we do nothing else? \n                else -> we pop? \n\n            But we always push? \n\n            So we can write:\n\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n                if (r < day) {\n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n\n            But note: we have to do the condition on r and day? \n\n            Actually, we computed r = m - size_y (before pushing). \n\n            Then we push: so the size becomes size_y+1? \n\n            Then if r < day, we pop? \n\n            But note: r < day  => m - size_y < day \n            After pushing, the available days becomes m - (size_y+1) = r-1? \n\n            But the condition for popping is that we have exceeded the available days? \n\n            Actually, the condition in the Python code is: \n                else: \n                    heapq.heappush(y, -s)\n                    heapq.heappop(y)\n\n            So it always pushes and then pops? \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n                if (r < day) {   // note: r was computed before pushing, so the current size is now size_y+1? \n                    // we are going to pop? \n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n                else {\n                    // we don't pop? \n                }\n\n            But wait, the condition in the Python code is: \n                if r >= -d:   [then we push and don't pop]\n                else: [we push and then pop]\n\n            So we must do:\n\n                if (r >= day) {\n                    // then we only push? and then we don't pop? \n                    push_y(salary);\n                    total_salary += salary;\n                } else {\n                    // we push and then pop? \n                    push_y(salary);\n                    total_salary += salary;\n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n\n            But we can factor the push and the adding? \n\n            We can write:\n\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n                if (r < day) {\n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n\n            Why? \n\n            Because if r>=day, then we don't pop? so we leave it as push and add? \n            If r<day, then we push and add and then pop and subtract the popped value? \n\n            But note: the condition r was computed before the push? \n\n            And the push increases the heap size? \n\n            Then the condition for popping is that we are in the else branch? \n\n            So we can use the condition (r < day) to decide to pop? \n\n            However, we must note: the condition in the Python code is based on the state before pushing? \n\n            So it's safe? \n\n        Therefore, we'll do:\n\n            total_salary = 0;\n            while (x is not empty) {\n                job = pop_x()\n                day = -job.neg_day;\n                salary = -job.neg_salary;\n\n                r = m - size_y;   // available days before we add this job\n\n                push_y(salary);\n                total_salary += salary;\n\n                if (r < day) {   // the condition: if we didn't have enough available days? \n                    int small = pop_y();\n                    total_salary -= small;\n                }\n            }\n\n        But note: the condition in the Python code is: \n            if r >= -d: then we don't pop? \n            else: we pop? \n\n            Here, we have: \n                r = m - size_y   [current available days]\n                day = -d? because d = -day? so -d = day? \n\n            So condition: if (r >= day) -> then we don't pop? \n            else: pop? \n\n            So we can write:\n\n                if (r < day) {\n                    pop and adjust total_salary? \n                }\n\n        Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n   Memory: \n\n        We are reading up to 200000? (n and m can be up to 200000? the problem doesn't specify, but we assume large)\n\n        We'll allocate heaps of size n? \n\n        The heap_x: we push n elements? \n\n        The heap_y: we push at most n elements? \n\n        We'll use arrays and heapify? \n\n        But we are going to do n pops from heap_x and n pushes to heap_y? and at most n pops from heap_y? \n\n        So the total operations: O(n log n) for the heaps?

\n\n        But the problem doesn't specify constraints? \n\n        We'll assume n up to 200000? \n\n        The heaps have O(n) space and O(log n) per operation? \n\n        The total time is O(n log n)? \n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the first program uses heapq which is a min-heap, and we are simulating the same.\n\n   We'll write the entire program.\n\n   But note: the total_salary might be large? use long long.\n\n   We'll test with a small example? \n\n        n=1, m=1: \n            job: (day, salary) = (1, 100)\n\n            Then: \n                heap_x: push( (-1, -100) ) -> then pop: ( -1, -100 ) -> then day=1, salary=100.\n                r = m - size_y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n                Condition: r>=day -> 1>=1 -> true -> then we push 100 into heap_y? \n                total_salary = 100.\n\n            Then convert 100 to string: \"100\" -> \n                distinct: {'1','0'} -> 2 distinct? \n                then check: \n                    '1': count=1 -> fails -> output \"No\"\n\n        But the original chain: \n            First program outputs 100? \n            Second program reads \"100\" -> distinct set has 2 elements? then check counts: \n                '1':1, '0':2 -> fails -> \"No\"\n\n        So our program outputs \"No\".\n\n   Another example: \n        n=1, m=1: job (2, 100) \n            Then: \n                r = 1 - 0 = 1, which is < 2 -> so we push 100 and then pop? \n                total_salary: add 100 then subtract the popped value? \n                After push, heap_y: [100] -> then pop: returns 100 -> total_salary becomes 0.\n\n            Then we output 0? \n            Then the second program: \n                \"0\" -> distinct set: {'0'} -> size=1 -> \"No\"\n\n        So output \"No\".\n\n   Example that outputs \"Yes\": \n        We need the total_salary to be a 4-digit number with two distinct digits, each twice? e.g., 1122, 1212, 1001, etc.\n\n        How to get total_salary=1122? \n\n        We need to find jobs that yield 1122? \n\n        This might be complex? \n\n        But we can try: \n            We need two jobs: \n                job1: (d1, s1) and job2: (d2, s2) such that the algorithm selects both and s1+s2=1122.\n\n            And the scheduling must be valid? \n\n        Alternatively, we can try: \n            n=2, m=2, \n            job1: (1, 1122) -> then we assign it? \n            job2: (1, 0) -> then we assign it? \n            total_salary = 1122+0 = 1122.\n\n            But then the second program: \n                \"1122\" -> distinct: '1' and '2'? \n                counts: '1':2, '2':2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n=2, m=2.\n\n            Build heap_x: \n                job1: (-1, -1122)\n                job2: (-1, 0)   -> but note: we push (-1, -0) -> but 0 is 0.\n\n            Then pop from heap_x: we get the one with the smallest neg_day? both have -1? \n                then compare neg_salary: -1122 and 0? -> -1122 is smaller? so we pop job1 first? \n\n            Then:\n                job1: day=1, salary=1122.\n                r = 2 - 0 = 2 >= 1 -> push 1122 -> heap_y: [1122], total_salary=1122.\n\n            Then pop next job: \n                job2: (-1,0) -> day=1, salary=0.\n                r = 2 - 1 = 1 >= 1 -> push 0 -> heap_y: [0,1122] -> but the min-heap will be [0,1122]? \n                total_salary = 1122+0 = 1122.\n\n            Then we output 1122.\n\n            Then we convert to string: \"1122\", then check: \n                distinct: '1' and '2'? \n                counts: \n                    '1':2, '2':2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        So our program should output \"Yes\".\n\n        However, note: the heap for x: when two jobs have the same day, we break by neg_salary? \n            We want the one with the largest salary to come first? \n            Because we push (-salary) so the smallest neg_salary (which is the largest salary) should come first? \n\n            But in the heap, we compare by neg_salary? and we want the smallest neg_salary? \n\n            In our heapify_down_x: \n                We compare by neg_day first? then by neg_salary? \n\n            For job1: (-1, -1122) and job2: (-1,0) -> \n                neg_day same? then compare neg_salary: -1122 vs 0 -> -1122 is smaller? so job1 is popped first? \n\n            This is correct? because the job with the same day and larger salary should be processed first? \n\n            Yes, because we want to assign the job with larger salary first? \n\n        But note: the algorithm doesn't depend on the order for same day? \n\n        However, we are simulating the same as the Python code? \n\n        The Python code: \n            heapq.heappush(x, (-day, -salary))\n\n            Then when we pop, we get the smallest -day (largest day) and then smallest -salary (largest salary) for the same day? \n\n        So we are good.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious for large inputs? \n\n   Let's write the entire C program.\n\n   Due to the complexity, we hope it works.\n\n   Edge: n=0? \n\n        Then heap_x is empty? then we go to the second program with total_salary=0.\n\n        Convert 0 to string: \"0\" -> distinct=1 -> \"No\"\n\n   So we output \"No\".\n\n   Now, we write the code.\n\n   Note: We must free memory? \n\n   But if n is large, we must avoid memory leaks? \n\n   We'll free the heaps.\n\n   We assume the input is correct.\n\n   Let's code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We must not output anything extra.\n\n   We only output \"Yes\" or \"No\" at the end.\n\n   We do not output the total_salary.\n\n   The entire program:\n\n        Read the input for the first program? \n        Process the jobs? \n        Then run the second program on the string representation of the total_salary.\n\n   We'll write accordingly.\n\n   Due to the length, we hope we covered everything.\n\n   We'll now write the C code accordingly."
