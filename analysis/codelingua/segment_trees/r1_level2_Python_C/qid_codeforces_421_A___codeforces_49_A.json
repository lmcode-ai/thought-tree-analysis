Then for k=0: k+1=1 is in lista -> print \"1 \" (without newline). Then the second program reads the string \"1 \" (without the quotes, and including the space). Then the second program:\n      i from len(a)-1 = 1 down to 0:\n        i=1: character is space -> skip. i=0: character is '1' -> not in vo -> prints \"NO\". But what if the token is '1'?

Then the second program: \n          Trailing space: skip -> then the next character from the end is the last '1'. Then check: '1' is not a vowel -> \"NO\".

But wait: what if the string of the first program has trailing spaces and then the second program skips them and then finds nothing? Actually, the first program for n=0 prints nothing -> the string is empty. Then the second program doesn't find any non-space -> so no output. Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, a, b.\n      Step 2: If n==0, then we skip reading the next two lines? Actually, we have to read the next two lines: the problem says the input has three lines. The second line has a integers and the third has b integers. So even if n==0, we must read the next two lines? But the problem says: the input format is:\n\n          first line: n, a, b\n          second line: a integers\n          third line: b integers\n\n      So we must read two more lines. Step 3: We don't care about the lists for the final output? Because the second program only depends on the last token, which we know is a digit (if n>0) and we know the answer is \"NO\" for n>0, and for n==0 we output nothing.

So we don't need to know the token? we know it's a digit. Therefore, we don't need to process the lists at all? except that we have to read them. Therefore, the program can be:\n\n      int n, a, b;\n      scanf(\"%d % d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n      // Then read the next two lines: we don't care about the numbers? but we have to read them to clear the input.\n      // For the second line: a integers\n      for (int i=0; i<a; i++) {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n      }\n      // Third line: b integers\n      for (int i=0; i<b; i++) {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n      }\n\n      // Now, if n>0, then the last non-space character of the first program's output is a digit (so not a vowel) -> output \"NO\"\n      // But note: the second program breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. And that character is a digit -> not a vowel -> so we output \"NO\".\n      // However, what if n==0? then we output nothing. if (n > 0) {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\n  But wait: the second program prints without a newline? Actually, it prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" and then a newline? Because in Python, `print(\"YES\")` adds a newline. So we output \"NO\" with a newline. However, let me check the original chain for n=0: the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program does nothing -> no output. So we don't output anything. Therefore:\n\n      if (n>0) -> output \"NO\\n\"\n      else -> output nothing. But wait: what if the first program outputs a string that ends with a space? and the second program skips the spaces and then finds the last digit? and that digit is the token for the last k. But we don't need to simulate the entire first program? because we know the last token is a digit and the second program will always output \"NO\". However, what if the first program outputs a token that is not a digit? That cannot happen because the tokens are 1 or 2. So the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d % d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          // Read the a integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          // Read the b integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          // If n>0, then the second program will output \"NO\", else nothing. if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But wait: is that equivalent? Let me test with the example:\n\n      Example 1: n=1, a=2, b=2, then lista = [1] (from the next two integers? actually, the next line: two integers? but we read a=2, so we read two integers? but the input has two integers? yes. Then we read the next line: two integers for b. Then we output \"NO\\n\". Example 2: n=0 -> we output nothing. However, what if the second program in the original chain would have behaved differently?",

So we are safe. But what if the first program printed a space at the beginning? It doesn't: it starts with a digit. And the tokens are separated by spaces. The last character is a space. Then the last non-space is the last digit. Therefore, the C program is:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d % d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          // Read the next a integers\n          int temp;\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n          }\n\n          // Read the next b integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n          } if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, wait: what if the first program's output had a question mark? It doesn't. So we are safe. But note: the second program also skips question marks. But the first program never prints a question mark. So we are safe. Therefore, we output the above. However, let me test with the provided examples. Example 1: Input: \n          1 2 2\n          1\n          2\n\n      The C program: \n          Reads n=1, a=2, b=2. Then reads two integers: 1 and then the next integer? But the second line has only one integer? Actually, the second line is the list of a integers, but a=2 -> so we expect two integers. The input has only one integer on the second line? Wait: the input for the first program:\n\n      first line: \"1 2 2\"\n      second line: \"1\" -> but a=2, so we need two integers? Actually, the original Python program for the first block:\n\n      n, a, b = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n      lista = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")] listb = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n\n  The second line: we split the next input line and take the first a integers? but the line may have more?",

Yes. Then we process (by skipping the numbers) and then conditionally print at the end. This matches. But wait: what if the second program in the chain did not run at all when n=0? Our C program for n=0 does not print anything, which matches. Therefore, the code is as above. However, one more corner: what if n is negative? The problem states: n, a, b are integers. The first program: for k in range(n) -> if n is negative, the range is empty. So the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program outputs nothing. In our C program, we check n>0. If n is negative, we don't output. So that matches. But the input: the problem does not specify that n>=0. But in the context, n is the number of tokens to output -> so it should be nonnegative? The original Python program: `for k in range(n)` -> if n is negative, the loop runs 0 times. So n must be nonnegative? The problem does not specify, but we assume the input is as in the original.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (File1):\n  Reads three integers n, a, b (though a and b are the sizes of two lists, but we read them and then ignore them for the list reading?).\n  Then reads a list of a integers and a list of b integers.\n  Then for k from 0 to n-1, it checks if (k+1) is in the first list (lista). If yes, prints \"1 \", else \"2 \".\n\nHowever, note that the second program (File2) expects input from stdin. But in the chain, the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\nBut wait: the first program prints a string of numbers (each 1 or 2) with spaces. The second program reads a string and then processes it.\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input to the first program: \n      first line: n, a, b (three integers)\n      second line: a integers\n      third line: b integers\n\n  Output of the first program: a string of n tokens (each token is either \"1\" or \"2\") separated by spaces and without a trailing space? Actually, note: the first program uses `end=\" \"` so each print is followed by a space. Therefore, the output is a string of n numbers (each 1 or 2) with a space after each, including the last one? Actually, the last character will be a space.\n\n  The second program reads the entire output of the first program as a string? Actually, the second program uses `input()` which reads a line. But note: the first program does not print a newline. It uses `end=\" \"` so the entire output is one long line of tokens with spaces and then the program exits. The next program's `input()` would read that entire line.\n\n  However, the second program then processes the string `a` (the entire line). It goes from the last character backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark character. Then checks if that character is a vowel (in the list `vo`). Then prints \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the output of the first program ends with a space. So the last character of the string `a` in the second program is a space. Then the second program will skip that space and then the next non-space character? Actually, it iterates from the last character backwards until it finds a character that is not space and not '?'. Then it checks that character.\n\nHowever, in the first program's output, the last character is a space. Then the second program will skip all trailing spaces and question marks. But note that the first program's output does not have a question mark. So it will skip the trailing space and then the next character? Actually, the output of the first program is a sequence of digits and spaces. The last character is a space. Then the second program will skip that last space and then look at the character before that? But note: the output of the first program is a string of n tokens. For example, if n=1, then the output is \"1 \". Then the second program will skip the space (at index 1) and then look at the character at index 0 which is '1'. Then it checks if '1' is in `vo` (which is only vowels and 'y' in both cases) -> it's not. So it prints \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, the second program breaks after the first non-space, non-question mark character from the end? Actually, it breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark it encounters (which is the last non-space character in the string). So it should be the last digit of the last token? Actually, the tokens are either \"1\" or \"2\", so the last token is either \"1 \" or \"2 \"? Actually, the entire string ends with a space. So the last non-space character is the last digit (the last token's digit) which is at the position n*2-2? (if n tokens, then n-1 spaces and n digits, so the string length is n + (n-1) = 2n-1? but wait: the first program prints n tokens, each token is printed as the digit and then a space. So for n tokens, we have n digits and n spaces? Then the string length is 2n? But note: the last token is printed with a space at the end. So the entire string has n digits and n spaces? Then the last character is a space. Then the last non-space character is the last digit (which is the n-th token) at position 2n-2 (if we index from 0).\n\nBut the second program goes backwards and the first non-space non-question mark it finds is the last digit (the token for the last k). So it checks that digit: is it a vowel? Obviously, the digits are '1' or '2'. They are not vowels. Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\"?\n\nBut wait, let me check the example:\n\nExample: \n  Input to first program:\n      1 2 2\n      1\n      2\n  The first program: \n      n=1, a=2, b=2 -> then reads lista = [1] and listb = [2] (but note, we only use lista for the check).\n      Then for k=0: k+1=1 is in lista -> print \"1 \" (without newline).\n\n  Then the second program reads the string \"1 \" (without the quotes, and including the space).\n\n  Then the second program:\n      i from len(a)-1 = 1 down to 0:\n        i=1: character is space -> skip.\n        i=0: character is '1' -> not in vo -> prints \"NO\".\n\nBut what if the token is '1'? It's not a vowel. So always \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, what if the token was a vowel? Actually, the tokens are only the digits '1' and '2'. They are not vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\". \n\nBut that seems odd. Let me reexamine the second program: it breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. So it will always look at the last non-space character, which is the last digit of the last token. And that digit is either '1' or '2'. So always not a vowel -> always \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the entire chain for any input will produce a string of n tokens (each 1 or 2 with spaces) and then output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: what if the string has a question mark? The second program skips spaces and question marks. The first program does not output a question mark. So we skip spaces and then we hit a digit. So always \"NO\".\n\nHowever, the second program might be intended for a different context? But according to the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first. So the chain is fixed.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\". So we must output the same as the chain.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n  Step1: read n, a, b and two lists of integers (of sizes a and b respectively).\n  Step2: for k in [0, n-1]: if (k+1) in lista then output \"1 \", else \"2 \" (with no newline at the end, but a trailing space).\n  Step3: read the entire output of step2 as a string (which is one line without a newline? but when we read in C we might have to consider how the next program reads).\n\nBut note: the second program uses `input()` which reads a line. In the first program, we did not output a newline. However, when the first program exits, the output buffer is flushed? and the second program will read the entire output as one line (without a terminating newline? but the `input()` in Python will read until EOF or newline? Actually, the first program doesn't print a newline so the string does not have a newline. Then when the second program does `input()`, it will read the entire string until EOF? or until a newline? But the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a string without newline. Then `input()` in the second program will read that entire string as one line? Yes.\n\nBut in C, we are going to write the entire chain without intermediate I/O. So we have to:\n\n  - Read the input for the first program (three integers, then a list of a integers, then a list of b integers).\n  - Then simulate the first program: we would build a string of n tokens (each token is either \"1 \" or \"2 \") and note that we have to output the entire string without a newline? but actually we are going to use this string as the input for the second program.\n\n  However, the second program then processes that string. We don't actually output the string until the very end? The problem says: only the last block should produce output. And the first block reads input.\n\n  So the plan:\n\n  Step 1: Read the first line: n, a, b.\n  Step 2: Read the second line: a integers (store in an array for lista)\n  Step 3: Read the third line: b integers (store in an array for listb)\n\n  Then, we need to simulate the first program: we want to create a string that is the output of the first program. That string is a sequence of n tokens (each token is either \"1 \" or \"2 \"). But note: the last token will be followed by a space. Then we have a string of length 2*n (each token is 1 char for the digit and 1 space). But wait: what if the token is two digits? Actually, the tokens are only 1 and 2 -> single digits. So each token is two characters: the digit and a space? Actually, the first program prints: `print(1, end=\" \")` -> that prints the string \"1\" and then a space. Similarly for 2.\n\n  So we can create a string of 2*n characters. But note: we don't need to store the entire string if we are going to process it immediately for the second program? Actually, the second program only looks at the last non-space and non-question mark character. And since the string has no question marks, it will skip trailing spaces and then take the last digit (which is the last token).\n\n  But note: the entire string is built by the first program. The last token is the token for k = n-1. So the last digit is the token for the last k. How do we get that without building the entire string? We can note:\n\n      The last token is 1 if (n) is in lista, else 2.\n\n  Because for k = n-1, we check k+1 = n.\n\n  Therefore, the last non-space character in the entire string is:\n      '1' if n is in lista, else '2'\n\n  Then the second program checks if that character is a vowel? It is either '1' or '2'. So the answer for the second program is always \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n      Step 1: reads the input.\n      Step 2: outputs a string of n tokens (but we don't output it until the last step? Actually, the problem says only the last block produces output. So we are going to output the result of the second program? which is \"NO\" or \"YES\". But we just deduced that it is always \"NO\".\n\n  However, wait: what if the last token is '2'? It's still not a vowel. So always \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n  But let me test with a different example:\n\n      Input: \n          2 2 2\n          1 2\n          1 2\n\n      Then the first program: \n          k=0: 0+1=1 -> in lista? yes -> print \"1 \"\n          k=1: 1+1=2 -> in lista? yes -> print \"1 \"\n          So the string is \"1 1 \".\n\n      Then the second program: \n          Trailing space: skip -> then the next character from the end is the last '1'. Then check: '1' is not a vowel -> \"NO\".\n\n  Another example:\n\n      Input:\n          2 2 2\n          1\n          2\n\n      Then the first program:\n          k=0: 1 in lista? yes -> \"1 \"\n          k=1: 2 in lista? no -> \"2 \"\n          String: \"1 2 \"\n\n      Then the second program: skip the last space -> then the next character is '2' -> not a vowel -> \"NO\".\n\n  So indeed, the second program always outputs \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain can be simplified to:\n\n      Read the first three integers and then the next two lines (which we can ignore because we only need to know the last token and we only care if the last token is a vowel? but we know it's always a digit and not a vowel).\n\n  But wait: what if we don't have any tokens? n could be 0.\n\n  Then the first program prints nothing. The second program reads an empty string? Then when iterating from len(a)-1 down to 0, the loop doesn't run? Then it doesn't break and doesn't print anything? Actually, the loop runs from -1 down to 0? That is, the range is from -1 to -1 (step -1) -> i=-1: then we check a[-1]? but the string is empty -> index out of bounds? Actually, in Python, for an empty string, the range is `range(-1, -1, -1)` which is empty. So the loop does nothing and then the program ends without output? But the problem says the second program should output either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Actually, it doesn't output anything in that case.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So for n=0, the first program prints nothing. Then the second program runs and breaks without printing? Then the entire chain produces no output.\n\n  However, we must consider: the second program only prints when it finds a non-space and non-question mark. If it doesn't find any, it doesn't print. So the chain for n=0 produces no output.\n\n  Therefore, we have two cases:\n\n      Case 1: n > 0 -> output \"NO\"\n      Case 2: n == 0 -> output nothing.\n\n  But wait: what if the string of the first program has trailing spaces and then the second program skips them and then finds nothing? Actually, the first program for n=0 prints nothing -> the string is empty. Then the second program doesn't find any non-space -> so no output.\n\n  Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, a, b.\n      Step 2: If n==0, then we skip reading the next two lines? Actually, we have to read the next two lines: the problem says the input has three lines. The second line has a integers and the third has b integers. So even if n==0, we must read the next two lines? But the problem says: the input format is:\n\n          first line: n, a, b\n          second line: a integers\n          third line: b integers\n\n      So we must read two more lines.\n\n      Step 3: We don't care about the lists for the final output? Because the second program only depends on the last token, which we know is a digit (if n>0) and we know the answer is \"NO\" for n>0, and for n==0 we output nothing.\n\n      However, we must note: the second program does not run if the first program didn't output anything? Actually, the chain: the first program outputs a string. Then the second program runs on that string. If the string is empty, then the second program does nothing. So we don't output anything.\n\n  Therefore, the C program:\n\n      Read n, a, b.\n      Then read a integers (we can skip storing them? but we need to know the last token: which requires knowing if n is in lista? but wait: the last token is the token for k=n-1, which is for the number n. So we need to know if n is in lista? but we don't need to build the entire string. We only need to know the last token to build the entire string? Actually, no: the second program only uses the last non-space character. And that is the token for the last k (which is n). So we need to know if n is in lista? then the last token is 1 or 2. But then we don't use that token for anything except to know it's not a vowel? and then we output \"NO\". So we don't actually need to know the token value? because regardless, we output \"NO\".\n\n  However, wait: what if the token was 'a'? But the tokens are only 1 or 2. So we don't need to know the token? we know it's a digit. Therefore, we don't need to process the lists at all? except that we have to read them.\n\n  Therefore, the program can be:\n\n      int n, a, b;\n      scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n      // Then read the next two lines: we don't care about the numbers? but we have to read them to clear the input.\n      // For the second line: a integers\n      for (int i=0; i<a; i++) {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n      }\n      // Third line: b integers\n      for (int i=0; i<b; i++) {\n          int x;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n      }\n\n      // Now, if n>0, then the last non-space character of the first program's output is a digit (so not a vowel) -> output \"NO\"\n      // But note: the second program breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. And that character is a digit -> not a vowel -> so we output \"NO\".\n      // However, what if n==0? then we output nothing.\n\n      if (n > 0) {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\n  But wait: the second program prints without a newline? Actually, it prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" and then a newline? Because in Python, `print(\"YES\")` adds a newline.\n\n  So we output \"NO\" with a newline.\n\n  However, let me check the original chain for n=0: the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program does nothing -> no output. So we don't output anything.\n\n  Therefore:\n\n      if (n>0) -> output \"NO\\n\"\n      else -> output nothing.\n\n  But wait: what if the first program outputs a string that ends with a space? and the second program skips the spaces and then finds the last digit? and that digit is the token for the last k. But we don't need to simulate the entire first program? because we know the last token is a digit and the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\n  However, what if the first program outputs a token that is not a digit? That cannot happen because the tokens are 1 or 2.\n\n  So the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          // Read the a integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          // Read the b integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          // If n>0, then the second program will output \"NO\", else nothing.\n          if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But wait: is that equivalent? Let me test with the example:\n\n      Example 1: n=1, a=2, b=2, then lista = [1] (from the next two integers? actually, the next line: two integers? but we read a=2, so we read two integers? but the input has two integers? yes. Then we read the next line: two integers for b.\n\n      Then we output \"NO\\n\".\n\n      Example 2: n=0 -> we output nothing.\n\n  However, what if the second program in the original chain would have behaved differently? For example, what if the first program output a string that had a vowel in the middle? But the second program only checks the last non-space character. And the last non-space character is the last token, which is a digit. So the entire chain always outputs \"NO\" for n>0 and nothing for n=0.\n\n  But wait: what if the string output by the first program had a vowel? For example, if n=3 and the tokens are \"1 2 1 \", but what if the first program printed a letter? It doesn't. It only prints '1', '2', and spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the above C program is equivalent.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\". We are not simplifying the logic arbitrarily? But note: the chain of programs is fixed. We are allowed to optimize? The problem says: \"translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n  But the above program does not build the intermediate string. However, the intermediate string is not needed for the final output because we deduced that the second program's output only depends on the last token being a digit (and therefore not a vowel) and the presence of at least one token (n>0). Therefore, it is safe.\n\n  However, what if the second program had a different logic? For example, what if it looked for the first non-space from the beginning? Then we would have to build the entire string? But the second program's logic is fixed: it goes backwards.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the C program as above.\n\n  But wait: what if the first program's output had a newline? Actually, the first program does not print a newline. The second program reads the entire output as one line. And our C program does not simulate the entire string. But we don't need to because the second program's output is fixed.\n\n  However, note: the second program might read the entire output of the first program and then process it. But we deduced that the only thing that matters is that the last non-space character (if exists) is a digit. And we know that if n>0, then there is at least one token and the last non-space character is the last token's digit. And that digit is either '1' or '2'. So we are safe.\n\n  But what if the first program printed a space at the beginning? It doesn't: it starts with a digit. And the tokens are separated by spaces. The last character is a space. Then the last non-space is the last digit.\n\n  Therefore, the C program is:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          // Read the next a integers\n          int temp;\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n          }\n\n          // Read the next b integers\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &temp);\n          }\n\n          if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, wait: what if the first program's output had a question mark? It doesn't. So we are safe.\n\n  But note: the second program also skips question marks. But the first program never prints a question mark. So we are safe.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above.\n\n  However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \n          1 2 2\n          1\n          2\n\n      The C program: \n          Reads n=1, a=2, b=2.\n          Then reads two integers: 1 and then the next integer? But the second line has only one integer? Actually, the second line is the list of a integers, but a=2 -> so we expect two integers. The input has only one integer on the second line? \n\n  Wait: the input for the first program:\n\n      first line: \"1 2 2\"\n      second line: \"1\" -> but a=2, so we need two integers? \n\n  Actually, the original Python program for the first block:\n\n      n, a, b = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n      lista = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n      listb = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n\n  The second line: we split the next input line and take the first a integers? but the line may have more? Actually, it takes the entire line and converts each split token to an integer until the end. Then we take the first a integers? No, it takes all the tokens on that line and we assume there are exactly a tokens? because the problem says the input has a integers.\n\n  So in the example, the second line has only one integer? but a=2. That would be an error? \n\n  Actually, the example input I used: \n      \"1 2 2\"\n      \"1\"\n      \"2\"\n\n  This is invalid? because the second line should have 2 integers. So we must assume the input is as described.\n\n  Therefore, the C program must read a integers from the second line and b integers from the third line.\n\n  How to read? We can use a loop for a integers and a loop for b integers.\n\n  But note: the integers might be on the same line? The problem says the second line has a integers and the third line has b integers. So each line has exactly the required number of integers.\n\n  Therefore, we can read the integers with simple loops.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          // Read the a integers from the next line\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          // Read the b integers from the next line\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              int x;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: what if n=0? we don't output anything. That matches the original.\n\n  However, what if the second program in the original chain had a different behavior for n=0? It does: it doesn't output anything. So we are safe.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above C program.\n\n  But wait: what if the input has extra spaces? The original Python split by space and then takes the integers. Our C program using `scanf` with \"%d\" will skip any whitespace. So it will work.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the input format beyond the three lines. We assume the input is as described.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are only reading at the beginning and printing at the end.\n\n  However, we are reading the entire input at the beginning? Yes. Then we process (by skipping the numbers) and then conditionally print at the end.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  But wait: what if the second program in the chain did not run at all when n=0? Our C program for n=0 does not print anything, which matches.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n  However, one more corner: what if n is negative? The problem states: n, a, b are integers. The first program: for k in range(n) -> if n is negative, the range is empty. So the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program outputs nothing. In our C program, we check n>0. If n is negative, we don't output. So that matches.\n\n  But the input: the problem does not specify that n>=0. But in the context, n is the number of tokens to output -> so it should be nonnegative? The original Python program: `for k in range(n)` -> if n is negative, the loop runs 0 times. So n must be nonnegative? The problem does not specify, but we assume the input is as in the original.\n\n  Therefore, we can assume n>=0.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n\n          int x;\n          for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n          for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n          }\n\n          if (n > 0) {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }"
