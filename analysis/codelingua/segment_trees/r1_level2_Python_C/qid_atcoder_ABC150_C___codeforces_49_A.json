Then next_permutation: i: start at 0: arr[0]=1, arr[1]=2 -> 1<2 -> i=0. j: from the end: arr[1]=2>1 -> j=1. swap: [2,1]\n            then reverse from i+1=1 to 1: nothing -> [2,1]\n            index1: check p: [1,2] -> not\n                check q: [2,1] -> index_q=1\n\n            Then abs_diff = |0-1| = 1 -> string \"1\"\n            Then last character '1' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\"\n\n  So it works. We'll write the code accordingly. However, note: the next_permutation function: we have to be cautious. The standard algorithm is:\n\n      i = n-2; while (i>=0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) i--;\n      if (i<0) return 0;\n      j = n-1; while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;\n      swap(arr[i], arr[j]);\n      reverse(arr+i+1, arr+n); We did the reverse by two pointers? That's correct. We'll write the code. Note: the condition in the while for j: we use `arr[j] <= arr[i]`?",

Then the first j that we stop at is the one with arr[j] > arr[i].\n\n  Correct. Now, we write the entire C program. One more note: the absolute difference is nonnegative, so we can do:\n\n      long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n      if (abs_diff < 0) abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n\n  Or use labs? But we can do: abs_diff = labs(index_p - index_q); But we did:\n\n      long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n      if (abs_diff < 0) abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n\n  That's the same. Now, code: We include the necessary headers. Note: we use strchr? So we need <string.h>.",

So for n=11, 11! = 39916800 which is about 4e7, which fits in long (if long is 4 bytes, max 2e9? so up to n=12).

But note: the second program: it iterates from the last character (index len-1) backwards? So for \"1\", it checks index0? That's the last character? So we set pos to 0? Then we break? Then check. However, our while loop:\n\n      while (pos>=0 && (buffer[pos]==' ' or buffer[pos]=='?')) ... But buffer[0] is '1', so we break the while loop immediately? Then we set pos=0? Then we check.

Then we check buffer[0] -> '1' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\". That's correct. But note: what if the absolute difference is 10? Then the string is \"10\", then:\n\n      pos = 1 (the last character) -> buffer[1]=='0' -> not space -> break -> then we check '0' -> not vowel -> \"NO\".\n\n  Correct.

But to be safe, we generate until the end. Steps:\n\n      index = 0\n      do:\n          if current permutation equals p: index_p = index\n          if current permutation equals q: index_q = index\n          index++\n      } while (next_permutation(arr, n) is true);\n\n      Then compute abs_diff = abs(index_p - index_q)\n\n  However, note: the identity permutation is the first one? Then we start at index0? But in Python, the index of the first permutation is 0. So we start at 0. But note: our generation: the first permutation is the identity, then we generate the next? So we must start at the identity and then index=0, then generate next and index=1, etc. How about:\n\n      Start at identity -> index0 = 0\n      Then generate the next permutation and set index=1, then 2, etc. But we must check the identity permutation first. We can do:\n\n          check the identity permutation -> index=0\n          then while (next_permutation(...)) { ... index++ }\n\n  How to write next_permutation? We'll write a function. Steps for next_permutation:\n\n      int next_permutation(int *arr, int n) {\n          // Find the largest i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1]\n          int i = n-2;\n          while (i>=0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) i--; if (i < 0) return 0; // no next permutation\n\n          // Find the largest j>i such that arr[j] > arr[i]\n          int j = n-1;\n          while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;\n\n          // swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n          int temp = arr[i];\n          arr[i] = arr[j];\n          arr[j] = temp;\n\n          // reverse from i+1 to end\n          int left = i+1, right = n-1;\n          while (left < right) {\n              temp = arr[left];\n              arr[left] = arr[right];\n              arr[right] = temp;\n              left++;\n              right--;\n          }\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n  But note: the condition for j: we want the smallest j?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs that run in sequence.\n\nFirst program:\n  - Reads an integer `n`\n  - Reads two permutations `p` and `q` of the numbers 1 to n.\n  - Generates all permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] in lexicographic order.\n  - Finds the index of permutation `p` and `q` in the list of permutations.\n  - Prints the absolute difference of the indices.\n\nSecond program:\n  - Reads a string `a` (which in the chain will be the output of the first program: a string of digits, possibly negative? but note: the first program outputs a nonnegative integer as a string? Actually, the first program outputs `abs(pn - qn)` which is nonnegative, so it's a nonnegative integer as a string).\n  - However, note: the second program expects a string that might have spaces and question marks? But the output of the first program is just digits. So the second program will look at the last non-space, non-question mark character. Since the string from the first program has no spaces and no question marks, it will look at the last character of the digit string.\n\n  But wait: the second program iterates from the end backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark. Then it checks if that character is a vowel (in `vo`). If it is, prints \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the output of the first program is a nonnegative integer (so it's a string of digits). The last character of that string will be a digit. And digits are not vowels. Therefore, the second program will always print \"NO\", unless... unless the digit string ends with a vowel? But digits are not vowels.\n\n But wait: the vowels list includes both upper and lower case vowels. The digits are '0' to '9'. None of the digits are in the vowel list. Therefore, the second program will always break at the last character (which is a digit) and then print \"NO\".\n\n However, what if the output of the first program is an empty string? That's not possible because n is at least 1? The permutations are non-empty. The absolute difference of two indices is at least 0, so the string is at least \"0\". So the string is non-empty.\n\n Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: the chain is:\n\n  Input to first program: \n      n (integer)\n      then permutation p (n integers separated by spaces)\n      then permutation q (n integers separated by spaces)\n\n  Output of first program: a string representing a nonnegative integer (e.g., \"3\")\n\n  This output becomes the input to the second program.\n\n  The second program: \n      reads the string \"3\", then:\n          i = len(a)-1 -> 0 (because string \"3\" has length 1)\n          a[0] is '3' -> not space and not '?', so we check: is '3' in vo? -> no -> print \"NO\" and break.\n\nSo the entire chain: for any valid input, the output is \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: what if the absolute difference ends with a digit that is not a vowel? That's always the case. So the chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\nHowever, let's reconsider the second program: it is designed to look at the last non-space and non-question mark character of the entire string. The output of the first program is a string without any spaces or question marks. So the last character is the last non-space character. Therefore, it will check that last digit.\n\nBut note: what if the absolute difference is 10? Then the string is \"10\". The last character is '0', which is not a vowel -> \"NO\". Similarly, 12 -> '2' -> \"NO\". 5 -> '5' -> \"NO\". So indeed always \"NO\".\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nTherefore, the C program should:\n\n  1. Read n, then two permutations of size n.\n  2. Compute the absolute difference of the lexicographic ranks of the two permutations (without generating the entire list of permutations if n is large? But note: the original Python program uses `itertools.permutations` which is O(n!) and only feasible for small n. We assume n is small).\n\n  3. Then, take the absolute difference (which is a nonnegative integer) and then check the last character of the string representation of that number? Actually, we don't need to convert to a string and then back? Because the second program in the chain is given the string output of the first.\n\nBut note: the chain is connected by the output of the first being the input of the second. So in the C program:\n\n  - We don't output the absolute difference and then read it again as a string. Instead, we can directly use the integer to form a string? But the second program's logic is: look at the last non-space, non-question mark character. Since the string we would have produced is the integer as a string (without any spaces or question marks) we can just check the last character of that string.\n\nHowever, we can avoid building the entire string in memory? We only need the last character? But note: the second program breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. Since the entire string is digits, the last character is the last digit. So we can compute the last digit of the absolute difference? But note: the absolute difference is nonnegative. The last digit is `abs(pn - qn) % 10`. Then we can check if that digit (as a character) is in the set of vowels? But wait, the vowels are letters, not digits. So the last digit (any digit) is not a vowel. Therefore, the second program always prints \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, we can skip the entire string processing and always output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: what if the absolute difference is 0? The string is \"0\", which is not a vowel -> \"NO\". Similarly, 10 -> last digit '0' -> \"NO\". So always \"NO\".\n\nHowever, note: the second program may have more than one character? It breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. So if the string is \"10\", it skips nothing and checks the last character '0'. So we only need the last character.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\"\n\nSo we must simulate the entire chain. However, we notice that the second program's output is always \"NO\". Therefore, we can write a C program that:\n\n  - Does the permutation index computation (for small n) and then ignores the result? and then prints \"NO\".\n\nBut that would be incorrect if the last digit of the absolute difference were a vowel? However, there are no digits that are vowels. So it's safe.\n\nHowever, let's be faithful: we are going to:\n\n  1. Read n, then two permutations of n numbers.\n  2. Generate all permutations of [1, n] in lex order? (if n is small, we can do it, but n! grows fast; but the problem doesn't specify n, so we must assume n is small enough for generating all permutations? because the original Python program does that)\n\n  3. Find the index of p and q.\n  4. Compute the absolute difference, then convert that to a string (without printing it, but we need the string to simulate the second program).\n\n  5. Then, for the second program: we have a string (which is the absolute difference). We traverse from the end until we find a non-space and non-question mark (which we will find at the last character because the string has no spaces). Then we check if that last character is a vowel? It won't be, so we output \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the second program might break at the last character, which is the first non-space from the end? So we don't need to build the entire string? Actually, we can note:\n\n  - The string we built (the absolute difference) has no spaces and no question marks. Therefore, we can just take the last character and check if it is in the vowel set? But again, it won't be.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid building the entire list of permutations? Because the problem says n is small? The original Python program uses itertools.permutations, so we must assume n is small (like <= 10). We can generate the permutations in C.\n\nPlan:\n\n  Step 1: Read n.\n  Step 2: Read permutation p (n integers) and permutation q (n integers).\n  Step 3: Generate all permutations of 1..n in lex order and store in an array? Actually, we only need the index of p and q.\n\n  We can generate the permutations and count the index without storing all? But we need to compare with p and q. We can generate each permutation and check if it is equal to p or q? Then record the index.\n\n  Step 4: Compute the absolute difference = |index_p - index_q|.\n\n  Step 5: Now, we have an integer `abs_diff`. We convert it to a string (without printing). Then, we traverse that string from the end until we find a non-space and non-question mark? But the string we built has no spaces. So we can just take the last character? Actually, the second program breaks at the last non-space and non-question mark. Since our string has none, we take the last character.\n\n  Step 6: Check if that last character is in \"aeiouyAEIOUY\". Since it's a digit, it's not. So we output \"NO\".\n\nBut note: what if the absolute difference is 0? The string is \"0\", the last character is '0'. So we output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  - We generate the permutations and compute the absolute difference.\n  - Convert the absolute difference to a string (we'll use a buffer of sufficient size, since the maximum absolute difference is at most (n! - 1) and n! is a number with at most 10! = 3628800 (which is 7 digits) so 20 characters is safe.\n\n  - Then, we traverse the string backwards until we find a character that is not space and not '?'. Since our string has none, we start at the last character.\n\n  - Then check: if that character is one of the vowels? -> no -> then print \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the second program breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. So we break at the last character.\n\nHowever, we can optimize: we don't need to traverse the entire string? We can start at the end and the first character we look at is the last one, which is non-space -> we break.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  char *s = string_rep; // the string representation of the absolute difference\n  int len = strlen(s);\n  int i = len - 1;\n  // We are going to check at index i: it's not space and not '?', so we break immediately.\n\n  Then check s[i] against the vowels.\n\nBut note: what if the string is empty? We must consider that. The absolute difference is at least 0, so the string is at least \"0\", so non-empty.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll write a function to generate permutations? Or we can use a library? We'll do it by hand.\n\n  However, note: the original Python program uses lexicographic order. We can generate permutations in lex order by sorting the initial array? We start with [1,2,...,n] and then use next_permutation? But we are in C. We can generate all permutations by using a recursive function? Or we can use the std::next_permutation? But note: we are in C, not C++. So we have to implement.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a non-recursive next permutation algorithm? We can use the classic algorithm to generate the next permutation in lex order.\n\n  Steps for generating permutations:\n\n      Start with the first permutation (in increasing order).\n      Then repeatedly generate the next permutation until done.\n\n  We can use the algorithm from Knuth.\n\n  But note: the problem says the original Python program uses `itertools.permutations` which generates in lex order.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      int perm[10]; // max n=10? because 10! is 3.6e6 which is too many? but we assume n is small (like up to 8 or 9). The problem doesn't specify, but the original program uses itertools.permutations so n is small.\n\n      We'll generate all permutations and store them? Actually, we don't need to store all, we just need to count the index until we find p and q.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      index = 0\n      Start with the identity permutation: arr = [1,2,...,n]\n      while true:\n          if arr equals p, record index_p = index\n          if arr equals q, record index_q = index\n          index++\n          if there is no next permutation: break\n\n      Then abs_diff = abs(index_p - index_q)\n\n  How to check next permutation? We can use:\n\n      Step 1: Find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1]. If none, break.\n      Step 2: Find the largest index j such that arr[i] < arr[j].\n      Step 3: Swap arr[i] and arr[j].\n      Step 4: Reverse arr[i+1..end]\n\n  We'll write a function `next_permutation` that modifies the array and returns 1 if there is a next permutation, 0 otherwise.\n\n  But note: we must start at the identity permutation.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      int arr[n]; for i=0 to n-1: arr[i] = i+1\n\n      Then we start the loop.\n\n  We have to compare the current permutation with p and with q.\n\n  How to compare two arrays? We can use a loop.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      int index = 0;\n      int found_p = 0, found_q = 0;\n      long index_p, index_q;   // because the index might be large? but n is small.\n\n      We'll break when we have found both? Or we can run until the end? Because we don't know which comes first.\n\n      Actually, we must generate all permutations? Because we don't know the order.\n\n      But note: the index is the position in the entire list. So we must generate all.\n\n      However, we can break after we have found both? But we don't know if we have found both until we generate the entire set? Actually, we can break if we have found both.\n\n      But the problem does not specify that p and q are distinct? They might be the same? Then we break after we have found the same permutation for both? So we need to check every permutation.\n\n      Alternatively, we can generate until the end? Because n is small.\n\n      But to be safe, we generate until the end.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      index = 0\n      do:\n          if current permutation equals p: index_p = index\n          if current permutation equals q: index_q = index\n          index++\n      } while (next_permutation(arr, n) is true);\n\n      Then compute abs_diff = abs(index_p - index_q)\n\n  However, note: the identity permutation is the first one? Then we start at index0? But in Python, the index of the first permutation is 0. So we start at 0.\n\n  But note: our generation: the first permutation is the identity, then we generate the next? So we must start at the identity and then index=0, then generate next and index=1, etc.\n\n  How about:\n\n      Start at identity -> index0 = 0\n      Then generate the next permutation and set index=1, then 2, etc.\n\n      But we must check the identity permutation first.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          check the identity permutation -> index=0\n          then while (next_permutation(...)) { ... index++ }\n\n  How to write next_permutation? We'll write a function.\n\n  Steps for next_permutation:\n\n      int next_permutation(int *arr, int n) {\n          // Find the largest i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1]\n          int i = n-2;\n          while (i>=0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) i--;\n          if (i < 0) return 0; // no next permutation\n\n          // Find the largest j>i such that arr[j] > arr[i]\n          int j = n-1;\n          while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;\n\n          // swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n          int temp = arr[i];\n          arr[i] = arr[j];\n          arr[j] = temp;\n\n          // reverse from i+1 to end\n          int left = i+1, right = n-1;\n          while (left < right) {\n              temp = arr[left];\n              arr[left] = arr[right];\n              arr[right] = temp;\n              left++;\n              right--;\n          }\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n  But note: the condition for j: we want the smallest j? Actually, the next permutation algorithm: we want the smallest j greater than i such that arr[j] > arr[i] to minimize the change? But the standard algorithm is to take the smallest one? Actually, the algorithm I remember: we take the smallest j such that arr[j] > arr[i]? But we are scanning from the end backwards? Actually, we want the smallest j that is greater than i? But the array is decreasing from the end? Actually, we can take the last one? Because the array is decreasing from i+1 to the end? So we can take the last j such that arr[j] > arr[i]. That's what we did.\n\n  Actually, the algorithm:\n\n      Step 1: Find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1]. If no such index, return false.\n      Step 2: Find the largest index j such that j>i and arr[j] > arr[i].\n      Step 3: Swap arr[i] and arr[j].\n      Step 4: Reverse the suffix starting at i+1.\n\n  This is standard.\n\n  However, note: the condition for j: we are taking the largest j? Actually, we want the smallest value that is greater than arr[i] to put at i? But we are taking the largest j? That might not be the smallest value? But note: the suffix is in decreasing order? So the largest j such that arr[j] > arr[i] is the smallest element in the suffix that is greater than arr[i]? Actually, because the suffix is decreasing, the first element we meet from the end that is greater than arr[i] is the smallest element in the suffix that is greater than arr[i]. So it's correct.\n\n  But to be safe, we can do:\n\n      j = i+1;\n      while (j+1 < n && arr[j+1] > arr[i]) j++;   // this would be the last one that is greater? Actually, we can do:\n\n      Alternatively, we can do: we want the smallest element in the suffix that is greater than arr[i]. We can do:\n\n          j = i+1;\n          int candidate = -1;\n          for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\n              if (arr[j] > arr[i]) {\n                  if (candidate == -1 || arr[j] < arr[candidate]) {\n                      candidate = j;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          // then swap with candidate\n\n      But the standard algorithm is to take the last one? Because the suffix is decreasing? Actually, the condition: we know that the suffix is in decreasing order? Actually, we don't? We only know that arr[i] >= arr[i+1] ... and then we break at i? Actually, the condition: we found i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1] and the suffix is decreasing? Actually, the suffix is non-increasing? Because we started from the end and we found the first i that breaks the non-increasing? Then the suffix is decreasing? Actually, it's non-increasing? But we don't know if it's strictly.\n\n      The standard algorithm uses:\n\n          j = n-1;\n          while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;\n\n      Then swap. Then reverse the suffix.\n\n      This is standard.\n\n  We'll use the standard algorithm.\n\n  Steps for the main:\n\n      Read n.\n      Allocate arrays for p, q, and the current permutation.\n\n      Read p: n integers\n      Read q: n integers\n\n      Initialize current permutation: for i=0 to n-1: arr[i] = i+1\n\n      long index = 0;\n      long index_p = -1, index_q = -1;\n\n      do {\n          // Check if current permutation equals p\n          int equal_p = 1;\n          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n              if (arr[i] != p[i]) {\n                  equal_p = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          if (equal_p) index_p = index;\n\n          // Check if current permutation equals q\n          int equal_q = 1;\n          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n              if (arr[i] != q[i]) {\n                  equal_q = 0;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          if (equal_q) index_q = index;\n\n          // If we have found both, we can break early? But what if one is found and the other not? We must continue until we find both? Or we can break when both are found? But we don't know which one is first? Actually, we must generate until we have found both? But we don't know when we have found both until the entire set? Actually, we can break if both index_p and index_q are found? But it's possible that one permutation appears twice? But they are distinct? Actually, p and q are two given permutations. They might be the same? Then we break when we find that permutation? Then we set both at the same index? But we must continue until we have set both? Actually, we can break when both are found? But if they are the same, then we set both at the same time? Then we break? But we haven't set both? We set index_p at the first time we see the permutation? Then we set index_q at the same time? So we break? Then we break? But what if one permutation appears again? Permutations are unique. So each permutation appears exactly once.\n\n          Therefore, we can break if (index_p != -1 && index_q != -1). But we must generate until we have found both.\n\n          However, we don't know if we have found both until we check the current permutation? So we break after we have set both? Then we break out of the loop? But what if we break in the middle? Then we skip the rest? Actually, we don't need the rest? We only care about p and q.\n\n          So we can break early: if (index_p != -1 && index_q != -1) break;\n\n          Then we increment index and generate the next permutation.\n\n      } while (next_permutation(arr, n));\n\n      But note: the do-while loop: we start at the identity and then generate next. But the next_permutation function returns 1 if there is next, 0 otherwise. We break the loop when next_permutation returns 0.\n\n      However, we break early if we found both? Then we don't generate the entire set? That's an optimization.\n\n      Then compute abs_diff = abs(index_p - index_q)\n\n  Step 5: Convert abs_diff to a string.\n\n      char buffer[20];\n      sprintf(buffer, \"%ld\", abs_diff);   // because index_p and index_q are long, so abs_diff is long.\n\n      Then, we have the string in buffer.\n\n  Step 6: Simulate the second program:\n\n      int i = strlen(buffer) - 1;\n      // We traverse backwards until we find a non-space and non-question mark. Since our string has none, we start at the last character.\n\n      // Actually, we can do:\n      while (i >= 0) {\n          if (buffer[i] == ' ' || buffer[i] == '?') {\n              i--;\n          } else {\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Now, if i is negative? Then we found nothing? Then we do nothing? But the second program breaks? Actually, the second program would break without printing? But the original second program always finds one because the string is non-empty? So i should be >=0.\n\n      Then check if buffer[i] is in the set of vowels.\n\n      We can define:\n\n          char vowels[] = \"aeiouyAEIOUY\";\n\n      Then check: if strchr(vowels, buffer[i]) != NULL, then print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the second program breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark? So we break at the first one we find from the end? And then we break? So we do:\n\n      int len = strlen(buffer);\n      int pos = len - 1;\n      while (pos >= 0 && (buffer[pos] == ' ' || buffer[pos] == '?')) {\n          pos--;\n      }\n      if (pos < 0) {\n          // then we have no non-space? Then the second program would break without printing? But the original chain: the first program outputs a non-empty string? So this should not happen.\n          // We do nothing? But the second program would break without printing? Actually, the second program would break without printing? But the problem says: the second program breaks after the first non-space and non-question mark? But if there are none, then it doesn't print? But the problem says: the second program breaks? Then we do nothing? But the original program would break without printing? Then we output nothing? But the original chain: the second program always prints either \"YES\" or \"NO\". However, in this case, the string might be all spaces and question marks? But we know it's a number, so it's not.\n\n      } else {\n          char c = buffer[pos];\n          if (strchr(\"aeiouyAEIOUY\", c) != NULL) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  However, we know that the string is a nonnegative integer, so it's composed of digits. Therefore, we know that the character we get is a digit. So we can simply print \"NO\".\n\n  But to be faithful, we do the above.\n\n  However, note: the first program outputs a string without any space or question mark. Therefore, the while loop will not skip any character? Then pos will be the last index? So we can do:\n\n      int pos = strlen(buffer) - 1;\n\n      and then check buffer[pos]? But what if the number is negative? The absolute difference is nonnegative, so the string has no minus sign. So the last character is a digit.\n\n  So we can skip the while loop? But the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\", but we are not doing I/O? We are doing processing. We must simulate the second program exactly? But the second program has a loop that might not run? Actually, it runs from the last character backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark. Since the first character we check is the last one, which is not space and not '?', we break immediately. So we can just check the last character.\n\n  But to be safe, we write the loop.\n\n  Summary:\n\n      We'll read n, then two arrays p and q of size n.\n\n      We'll generate permutations and compute the indices of p and q.\n\n      We compute the absolute difference.\n\n      We convert the absolute difference to a string.\n\n      Then we traverse the string backwards until we find a non-space and non-question mark (which will be the last character, because the string is digits).\n\n      Then we check if that character is a vowel? -> no, so we print \"NO\".\n\n  However, note: what if the absolute difference is 0? Then the string is \"0\", the last character is '0'. Then we print \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the program will always print \"NO\".\n\n  But what if the absolute difference is 1? Then the last character is '1', then \"NO\".\n\n  So the program is:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      // Function to generate the next permutation in lex order. Returns 0 if there is no next permutation.\n      int next_permutation(int *arr, int n) {\n          // Find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i+1]\n          int i = n - 2;\n          while (i >= 0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) {\n              i--;\n          }\n          if (i < 0) {\n              return 0;\n          }\n          // Find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[j] > arr[i]\n          int j = n - 1;\n          while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) {\n              j--;\n          }\n          // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n          int temp = arr[i];\n          arr[i] = arr[j];\n          arr[j] = temp;\n\n          // Reverse the suffix from i+1 to the end\n          int left = i + 1;\n          int right = n - 1;\n          while (left < right) {\n              temp = arr[left];\n              arr[left] = arr[right];\n              arr[right] = temp;\n              left++;\n              right--;\n          }\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n          // Read permutation p\n          int *p = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Read permutation q\n          int *q = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &q[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Initialize the current permutation as the identity\n          int *arr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              arr[i] = i+1;\n          }\n\n          long index_count = 0;\n          long index_p = -1, index_q = -1;\n\n          // We'll generate permutations until we break\n          do {\n              // Check if current permutation equals p\n              int found_p = 1;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (arr[i] != p[i]) {\n                      found_p = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n              if (found_p) {\n                  index_p = index_count;\n              }\n\n              // Check if current permutation equals q\n              int found_q = 1;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (arr[i] != q[i]) {\n                      found_q = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n              if (found_q) {\n                  index_q = index_count;\n              }\n\n              // If both found, break early\n              if (index_p != -1 && index_q != -1) {\n                  break;\n              }\n\n              index_count++;\n\n          } while (next_permutation(arr, n));\n\n          // Free arr\n          free(arr);\n\n          // Compute absolute difference\n          long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n          if (abs_diff < 0) {\n              abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n          }\n\n          // Convert to string\n          char buffer[20]; // 20 characters is enough for a long\n          sprintf(buffer, \"%ld\", abs_diff);\n\n          // Now, simulate the second program: find the last non-space and non-question mark\n          int len = strlen(buffer);\n          int pos = len - 1;\n          // Traverse backwards until we find a character that is not space and not '?'\n          while (pos >= 0) {\n              if (buffer[pos] == ' ' || buffer[pos] == '?') {\n                  pos--;\n              } else {\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now, if we found one, check if it's a vowel\n          if (pos < 0) {\n              // No non-space?

That would be an error.\n\n              // Since we know the string is non-empty and without spaces, we can skip this? But to be safe, we do nothing? But the problem says the chain must behave identically. So we must not output anything? But then the entire chain would output nothing? That's not the case.\n\n              // Actually, the second program in the chain always outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Therefore, we must output one of them? But the condition: we found no non-space? Then the second program would break without printing? Then we output nothing? But that's not what the original second program would do? Let me check the original second program:\n\n                  for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n                      if (a[i] == ' ' or a[i] == '?'):\n                          continue\n                      else:\n                          if (a[i] in vo):\n                              print(\"YES\")\n                          else:\n                              print(\"NO\")\n                          break\n\n              So if the entire string is spaces and question marks, then the loop runs without breaking? Then after the loop, it does nothing? Then the program ends without printing? So we output nothing.\n\n              But in our case, the string is not spaces, so we don't have to worry.\n\n          } else {\n              char c = buffer[pos];\n              if (strchr(\"aeiouyAEIOUY\", c) != NULL) {\n                  printf(\"YES\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Free p and q\n          free(p);\n          free(q);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, we know that the string is digits, so the character is a digit and not a vowel. Therefore, we can replace the entire if-else by:\n\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n  But to be safe, we do the check.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are only printing at the end? And we are reading only at the beginning? So we are safe.\n\n  Let me test with n=1, p=[1], q=[1]:\n\n      Permutations: only [1]\n      index_p = 0, index_q = 0 -> abs_diff = 0 -> string \"0\"\n      Then we check: last non-space: '0' -> not vowel -> \"NO\"\n\n  So output \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n  But note: the second program prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" and then breaks? So we print one line.\n\n  We'll output the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the original second program breaks after printing? So we do the same.\n\n  But note: the problem says: the entire chain. The first program in the chain prints the absolute difference? But in our C program, we don't print the absolute difference? We use it as an intermediate string. That's the requirement: only the last block produces output.\n\n  So we only print the \"NO\" (or \"YES\" in the hypothetical case that the absolute difference ends with a vowel, but that never happens).\n\n  Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain prints without a space? It uses `print(\"YES\")` which adds a newline? Similarly, our printf(\"YES\\n\") adds a newline. So we add a newline.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  However, note: the next_permutation function: what if n==0? The problem says n is at least 1? Because the permutations are from 1 to n. So we assume n>=1.\n\n  Also, the array for permutations: we use int arr[n] for the current permutation? We allocated with malloc.\n\n  We free the memory? Yes.\n\n  But note: the next_permutation function: we assume the array is modifiable.\n\n  Let me test with n=2:\n\n      p = [1,2], q = [2,1]\n\n      Permutations:\n\n        [1,2] -> index0: \n            p is [1,2] -> index_p=0\n            q is [2,1] -> not found? \n        Then next_permutation: \n            i: start at 0: arr[0]=1, arr[1]=2 -> 1<2 -> i=0.\n            j: from the end: arr[1]=2>1 -> j=1.\n            swap: [2,1]\n            then reverse from i+1=1 to 1: nothing -> [2,1]\n            index1: \n                check p: [1,2] -> not\n                check q: [2,1] -> index_q=1\n\n            Then abs_diff = |0-1| = 1 -> string \"1\"\n            Then last character '1' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\"\n\n  So it works.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the next_permutation function: we have to be cautious. The standard algorithm is:\n\n      i = n-2; while (i>=0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) i--;\n      if (i<0) return 0;\n      j = n-1; while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;\n      swap(arr[i], arr[j]);\n      reverse(arr+i+1, arr+n);\n\n  We did the reverse by two pointers? That's correct.\n\n  We'll write the code.\n\n  Note: the condition in the while for j: we use `arr[j] <= arr[i]`? Actually, we want the first j from the end such that arr[j] > arr[i]. So we break when we find one that is >? Actually, we are decrementing until we find one that is >? But the condition is `while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) j--;` -> so if arr[j] <= arr[i], we skip. Then the first j that we stop at is the one with arr[j] > arr[i].\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Now, we write the entire C program.\n\n  One more note: the absolute difference is nonnegative, so we can do:\n\n      long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n      if (abs_diff < 0) abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n\n  Or use labs? But we can do:\n\n      abs_diff = labs(index_p - index_q);\n\n  But we did:\n\n      long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n      if (abs_diff < 0) abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n\n  That's the same.\n\n  Now, code:\n\n      We include the necessary headers.\n\n  Note: we use strchr? So we need <string.h>.\n\n  We write the next_permutation function.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We assume n is at most 10? But we use dynamic allocation for n.\n\n  We'll write the code as below.\n\n  However, note: the absolute difference might be large? We use long for the indices? Because n! can be large for n=10 -> 10! = 3628800, which fits in long (which is at least 4 bytes, up to 2e9). So for n=11, 11! = 39916800 which is about 4e7, which fits in long (if long is 4 bytes, max 2e9? so up to n=12). But the problem doesn't specify n, but the original Python program uses itertools.permutations so we assume n is small.\n\n  We use long for the indices.\n\n  Code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int next_permutation(int *arr, int n) {\n          int i = n - 2;\n          while (i >= 0 && arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) {\n              i--;\n          }\n          if (i < 0) {\n              return 0;\n          }\n          int j = n - 1;\n          while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) {\n              j--;\n          }\n          int temp = arr[i];\n          arr[i] = arr[j];\n          arr[j] = temp;\n          int left = i + 1;\n          int right = n - 1;\n          while (left < right) {\n              temp = arr[left];\n              arr[left] = arr[right];\n              arr[right] = temp;\n              left++;\n              right--;\n          }\n          return 1;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          int *p = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          int *q = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]);\n          }\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &q[i]);\n          }\n\n          int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              arr[i] = i+1;\n          }\n\n          long index_count = 0;\n          long index_p = -1, index_q = -1;\n\n          do {\n              // Check for p\n              int found_p = 1;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (arr[i] != p[i]) {\n                      found_p = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n              if (found_p) {\n                  index_p = index_count;\n              }\n\n              // Check for q\n              int found_q = 1;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (arr[i] != q[i]) {\n                      found_q = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n              if (found_q) {\n                  index_q = index_count;\n              }\n\n              if (index_p != -1 && index_q != -1) {\n                  break;\n              }\n\n              index_count++;\n          } while (next_permutation(arr, n));\n\n          free(arr);\n\n          long abs_diff = index_p - index_q;\n          if (abs_diff < 0) {\n              abs_diff = -abs_diff;\n          }\n\n          char buffer[20];\n          sprintf(buffer, \"%ld\", abs_diff);\n\n          int pos = strlen(buffer) - 1; // Start from the last character\n          // The second program traverses backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark.\n          while (pos >= 0) {\n              if (buffer[pos] == ' ' || buffer[pos] == '?') {\n                  pos--;\n              } else {\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          if (pos < 0) {\n              // According to the second program, if no non-space non-question mark is found, it breaks without printing?

But the original second program would do the same.\n              // So we output nothing? But the problem says the entire chain? The original chain would output nothing? Then we output nothing.\n          } else {\n              char c = buffer[pos];\n              if (strchr(\"aeiouyAEIOUY\", c)) {\n                  printf(\"YES\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n              }\n          }\n\n          free(p);\n          free(q);\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  We can test with n=2, p=[1,2], q=[2,1] -> abs_diff=1 -> buffer=\"1\", then pos=0? because buffer[0] is '1'? Actually, the string is \"1\", so len=1, pos=0? Then we check buffer[0] which is '1' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the second program: it iterates from the last character (index len-1) backwards? So for \"1\", it checks index0? That's the last character? So we set pos to 0? Then we break? Then check.\n\n  However, our while loop:\n\n      while (pos>=0 && (buffer[pos]==' ' or buffer[pos]=='?')) ... \n\n      But buffer[0] is '1', so we break the while loop immediately? Then we set pos=0? Then we check.\n\n  But we wrote:\n\n      int pos = strlen(buffer) - 1;\n      while (pos >= 0) {\n          if (buffer[pos]==' ' or ...) then pos--;\n          else break;\n      }\n\n      So for \"1\": \n          pos=0, then check: if buffer[0] is space? no -> break -> so we use pos=0.\n\n  Then we check buffer[0] -> '1' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\".\n\n  That's correct.\n\n  But note: what if the absolute difference is 10? Then the string is \"10\", then:\n\n      pos = 1 (the last character) -> buffer[1]=='0' -> not space -> break -> then we check '0' -> not vowel -> \"NO\".\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n  Let me write the entire C program."
