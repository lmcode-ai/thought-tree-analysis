Therefore, if M==0, then the first program outputs nothing, so the second program would read nothing? and then the second program would break. In the second program, the input() would return nothing, and then int() would fail? We are not required to handle that?

Then the second program: next prime>=1 -> 2.\n\n      Output: 2. But what would the first program have printed? The first program would have built a heap: \n          (2,0), (1,1), (1,2) Pop the smallest: (1,1) -> then process node1. Iterate over its neighbors: set is {0}. Since parity[1] is 0, it prints (v+1, u+1) = (1, 2) -> so the first integer is 1. Then the second program would have read 1 and then output 2. So it matches.\n\n  Example: N=3, M=2: edges (2,3) and (1,2) -> then node0: {1} -> deg=1, node1: {0,2} -> deg=2, node2: {1} -> deg=1. The smallest non-zero degree is 1. Candidates: node0 and node2. We choose node0 (smaller index). Its neighbors: [1] -> smallest neighbor=1 -> X=1+1=2. Then the second program: next prime>=2 is 2. What would the first program have printed?\n      Heap: (1,0), (2,1), (1,2) Pop node0: deg=1, then for its only neighbor (node1): \n          prints (1+1, 0+1) = (2,1) -> first integer=2. Then the second program outputs 2. It matches. But wait: the first program then continues to process node1? but we don't care. So we are only capturing the first integer. Therefore, the C program below. Note: We must free memory in the even M>0 case. Also, we assume that the graph has no self-loops? and that the input is valid. Let's write the code accordingly. We'll do:\n\n      if (M % 2 != 0) {\n          // Set X = -1, then run the second program. } else {\n          if (M == 0) {\n              // Set X = 0\n          } else {\n              // Build graph and find X.\n          }\n      }\n\n  Then run the second program with X.\n\n  We'll factor out the second program as a function? or just duplicate the code. We'll do duplicated code for clarity. Note: the second program's sieve can be built once.",

The original Python program:\n\n  prime = [True] * (100010)\n  prime[0] = False\n  prime[1] = False\n  for i in range(4, 100010, 2):\n      prime[i] = False\n  i = 3\n  while (i * i <= 100008): if prime[i]:\n          for j in range(i + i, 100008, i):\n              prime[j] = False\n      i += 2\n\n  We did:\n\n      for (int i = 3; i * i < MAX_SIZE; i+=2) { if (prime[i]) {\n              for (int j = i*i; j < MAX_SIZE; j += i) {\n                  prime[j] = false;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  This is more optimized. But the original starts j from i+i. We start from i*i, which is correct. Also, the upper bound for the while loop in Python is i*i<=100008, which is the same as i*i < 100009? And our MAX_SIZE is 100010, so we cover up to 100009. So it is correct. We'll go with this code.",

Then run the second program: \n        We need to find the next prime >= X.\n\n        We know that the second program uses a sieve up to 100009. Steps for the second program:\n            - Create a boolean array `prime` of size 100010.\n            - Mark 0 and 1 as false.\n            - Mark even numbers (>=4) as false.\n            - Mark multiples of odd numbers starting from 3.\n            - Then scan from X up to 100007 to find the first prime. 6. Print that prime. But wait: what if X is greater than 100007? The second program scans up to 100007. In the Python program, the range is `for i in range(X, 100008)`. The upper bound is 100008, but the prime array goes to index 100009. So it will scan up to 100007?",

So it scans from X to 100007 (inclusive of X, exclusive of 100008). So if X>100007, the loop doesn't run and it doesn't find a prime? But the problem says the next prime >= X, and the next prime might be beyond 100007? However, the sieve is only built for 0..100009. And the loop scans from X to 100007. If X is 100008 or 100009, then the loop doesn't run, and it doesn't find a prime? But the sieve has prime[100009] = ? The sieve in the second program marks indices up to 100009. But the loop only goes to 100007. Therefore, if X is 100008, then the loop runs from 100008 to 100007 -> which is an empty range. Then it breaks and prints nothing? But the problem says it breaks after finding the first prime. In the Python program, if X=100008, then the loop runs from 100008 to 100007, which is empty. Then it does nothing and the program ends without output? That is a flaw in the second program. But the problem says to translate, so we replicate the flaw.",

But the problem might not have such large X.\n\n  Alternatively, the first integer from the first program is at most N, and N is the number of vertices. The problem does not specify N, but the sieve is built for 100010, so we assume N<=100000. So X = v+1, and v is a vertex index, so 0<=v<=N-1, so X is between 1 and N, and N<=100000. So we are safe. Similarly, if M is odd, X=-1, and if M is even and 0, X=0, and both -1 and 0 are within the sieve range. Therefore, the scan from X to 100007 will always find a prime? because there are primes in that range.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs that run in sequence. The first program reads input and produces output. The second program then reads input (which would be the last output of the first program) and produces the final output.\n\nHowever, note the requirement: \n  - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n  - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n  - Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\nBut in the provided sequence, the first program prints multiple lines and then the second program reads one integer (presumably the last printed integer from the first program?).\n\nBut wait: the first program prints multiple edges and then sometimes prints -1. The second program reads an integer X.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. This implies that the entire output of the first program becomes the input to the second. But the second program only reads one integer.\n\nThis mismatch suggests that we must reinterpret the sequence. The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program produces some output, and then the second program is run with that output as its standard input.\n\nBut the first program can output:\n  Option 1: If M is odd, it prints \"-1\" and exits. Then the second program would run with input \"-1\", which is not a positive integer and would break the second program.\n\n  Option 2: If M is even, it prints a sequence of edges (each edge as two numbers per line) and then exits. Then the second program would read the first integer of the first line of that output? But the second program only reads one integer.\n\nThis does not seem to be a coherent pipeline.\n\nLooking again at the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"when run on the same input\".\n\nBut note: the two Python programs are meant to be run in sequence. The first program reads N, M and edges, and then either prints -1 (if M is odd) or a list of edges (if M is even). The second program reads an integer X and then prints the next prime >= X.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So if the first program outputs multiple lines (each with two numbers) and the second program only reads one integer, then the second program would read the first integer of the first line of the first program's output? But that doesn't make sense because the first program outputs edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the entire output of the first program is the input to the second? But the second program only reads one integer. So the rest of the output would be left unread? Then the second program would output a prime number based on the first integer it reads.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would run the first program and then the second program. The second program would read from the same stdin that the first program wrote to? Actually, in a typical shell pipeline, the entire output of the first program is fed to the second program's stdin.\n\nSo the second program's `input()` would read the first token of the first program's output.\n\nHowever, the first program either:\n  1. Prints a single line with \"-1\", then exits. Then the second program reads X = -1? But note: the second program expects an integer and then computes primes from that integer. However, the prime sieve in the second program marks 0 and 1 as non-prime, and then for even numbers and multiples. It would then look for the next prime >= -1. Since primes are positive, it would start at -1? Then it would check from -1 to 100007? But negative numbers are not prime. So it would break? Actually, the prime array is built for indices 0 to 100009. Then it checks from X (which is -1) to 100007. The loop `for i in range(X, 100008)` would run from -1 to 100007. But the prime array is only defined for indices 0 to 100009. So when i is negative, prime[i] would be out of bounds? Actually, no: the prime list is of size 100010, so indices 0 to 100009. So when i is negative, we skip? Actually, the prime array does not have negative indices. So the second program would crash? But in the original chain, the first program printed -1 and then the second program would read that and then try to run the loop from -1 to 100007? That would cause an error in the prime array access? But note: the prime array is built for indices 0 to 100009. The second program's loop iterates from X to 100007. If X is negative, then the first iteration is i = -1, then we try to access prime[-1] which is out of bounds? Actually, in Python, negative indices are allowed (they wrap around). So prime[-1] would be the last element? That is not intended.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must consider the entire behavior.\n\nBut note: the problem states that the first program might output -1 and then exit. Then the second program would run. However, the problem also says that the entire C program should behave identically. So if the first part fails (M is odd), then we should output -1 and then run the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part would then run and output a prime? That is not what the original chain does: the original chain would output -1 (from the first program) and then the second program would output a prime? But the user would see two outputs: first -1, then a prime? However, the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we must suppress the intermediate output? \n\nThis suggests that we are not to actually run the programs as separate processes, but to combine the logic without intermediate I/O.\n\nLet me reinterpret the problem: we are to write a single C program that does the same as the chain of two programs, but without any intermediate I/O. The first program's output is not printed to the screen, but captured and used as input to the second program. Then only the final output (of the second program) is printed.\n\nBut note: the first program either prints -1 (and then exits) or prints a set of edges. Then the second program reads one integer (which is the first token of the first program's output). However, the second program does not care about the entire output of the first program, only the first token? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So if the first program prints multiple lines, the second program would only read the first token? That might be the first integer of the first line.\n\nBut what is the first token of the first program's output?\n  Case 1: M is odd -> output \"-1\" -> the first token is -1.\n  Case 2: M is even -> the first token is the first number of the first edge.\n\nHowever, the second program then uses that token as X to compute the next prime.\n\nBut the original chain: \n  If M is odd, the first program prints \"-1\", then the second program reads that -1 and then prints the next prime >= -1? which would be 2? But the problem says the entire chain should output the same. The original chain would output two things: first \"-1\", then a prime number? But the problem says \"only the last block should handle producing output\", meaning we should only output the prime? But then what about the -1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is broken when the first program fails? But the problem does not specify.\n\nLooking at the first program: if M is odd, it prints -1 and exits. Then the second program runs and reads the -1 and then outputs the next prime? That doesn't seem to match the problem's requirement of \"behaves identically\" because the original chain would output two lines? But the problem says that the entire C program should reproduce the same behavior. So if the first program fails, the entire chain should output -1? and then stop? But the second program runs regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that the first program's output is captured and then the second program runs on that entire output. But the second program only reads one integer. So it reads the first token and ignores the rest? That would be the behavior.\n\nBut then the entire chain would output:\n  Case 1: M is odd: \n      First program: prints \"-1\"\n      Second program: reads -1, then outputs the next prime (which is 2? because 0 and 1 are not prime, 2 is prime) -> so output 2?\n  Case 2: M is even: \n      First program: prints a list of edges (each edge as two numbers per line). The first token of the first line is the first number of the first edge.\n      Second program: reads that number (say a) and then outputs the next prime >= a.\n\nBut that is not what the problem expects? The problem expects that if M is odd, we output -1 and that's the end? But the chain runs the second program anyway.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the first program's output is the input to the second program only if the first program did not output -1? But that is not specified.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let me read the problem again: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". So we must exactly mimic the two programs run in sequence.\n\nBut note: the first program, if M is odd, prints -1 and exits. Then the second program runs and reads from stdin. However, the first program has already printed -1 to stdout. Then the second program reads from stdin? But the user input is already consumed by the first program? How does the second program get its input? \n\nActually, the two programs are connected by a pipe: the stdout of the first is connected to the stdin of the second. The first program writes -1 to stdout and then exits. Then the second program reads from its stdin (which is the pipe) and gets the string \"-1\\n\", so input() returns the string \"-1\" and converts to int -1.\n\nThen the second program computes the next prime >= -1? and prints that prime? So the entire output of the chain is two lines: \n  -1\n  2\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we are not to output the -1? But then the behavior is not identical.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to run the entire chain and then output only the final result? But the chain outputs two lines.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior when run on the same input.\"\n\nThe same behavior: meaning the same output to stdout.\n\nThe original chain of two programs would produce:\n  If M is odd: \n      Program1 outputs: \"-1\\n\"\n      Program2 outputs: the next prime after the integer it reads (which is -1) -> \"2\\n\" (since 2 is the first prime >= -1? but note: primes are positive, so the first prime is 2). So the entire output would be:\n          -1\n          2\n\n  If M is even:\n      Program1 outputs: a sequence of edges (each edge as two numbers per line, so M lines). \n      Program2 outputs: the next prime after the first integer it reads (which is the first number of the first edge). So the entire output would be:\n          (edge1)\n          (edge2)\n          ...\n          (edgeM)\n          (prime number)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we should not output the edges? But then we lose the edges? \n\nThis indicates that the problem might have been designed incorrectly? Or perhaps the two programs are independent? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the first program is not printed to the screen, but is used internally as input to the second program, and only the second program's output is printed? That would match \"only the last block should produce output\". Then the entire chain's output would be the output of the second program.\n\nBut then the behavior would be:\n  If M is odd: the first program outputs -1 (but that is not printed? but then the second program reads -1 and outputs 2? so the entire program outputs 2?\n  If M is even: the first program outputs a bunch of edges (but that is not printed? then the second program reads the first token of that output (which is the first number of the first edge) and outputs the next prime? so the entire program outputs one integer: the prime.\n\nBut that is not the same as the original chain. The original chain outputs two lines in the odd case and M+1 lines in the even case.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think we must adhere to the requirement: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning the entire C program should output exactly what the second program outputs. \n\nBut then what about the first program? It must run and produce some output that is captured and fed to the second program as input. But the second program only uses the first integer of that output.\n\nTherefore, we can reframe:\n\nWe are to run the first program without actually printing anything (so we simulate its output in memory). Then we take the first token of its output (if any) and use that as the integer X for the second program. Then we output the result of the second program.\n\nBut note: if the first program outputs -1, then we use X=-1 for the second program. Then the second program outputs the next prime >= -1 (which is 2). So the entire program outputs 2.\n\nHowever, the original chain outputs two lines: \"-1\" and then \"2\". But we are only outputting \"2\". This is not identical.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the chain is broken in the first program? The first program exits when M is odd, and the second program runs independently? But the second program's input is the output of the first program. So if the first program exits without producing any output? But it does: it prints -1.\n\nAfter careful thought, I think the intended behavior is:\n\nThe entire C program should do:\n  Step 1: Read the input (N, M and M edges) and run the first program's logic. \n      If M is odd, then we output -1 and exit the entire program? because the problem says the first program exits and then the second program runs? But then the second program would run? However, the problem says the entire sequence. So we must run the second program only if the first program did not exit? \n\nBut the problem does not specify.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program is run regardless. But then the entire program must output two things: the first program's output and then the second program's output? But that violates the requirement that only the last block produces output.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I propose the following:\n\nWe are to combine the two programs so that:\n  - We read the input only once at the beginning (N, M and the edges).\n  - We run the logic of the first program. If M is odd, then we output -1 and then run the second program? But wait, the requirement says only the last block should produce output. So we cannot output -1? \n\nBut then what? The problem says \"behaves identically\". So if M is odd, the entire program should output -1? and then stop? because the first program exits? Then the second program is not run? \n\nBut the problem says \"the entire sequence\" meaning both programs? \n\nLooking at the code of the first program: when M is odd, it prints -1 and then exits. So the second program is not run? Actually, in a shell, the first program exits and then the second program is run? But the second program would read from the pipe: if the first program closed the pipe after writing -1, then the second program would read -1 and then run.\n\nSo the second program is always run.\n\nTherefore, the entire program must:\n  - If M is odd: the first program outputs \"-1\\n\" and then the second program runs with input -1 and outputs the next prime (2).\n  - If M is even: the first program outputs a list of edges (M lines) and then the second program runs and reads the first integer of the first line of that output and outputs the next prime.\n\nBut then the entire output is two parts: the first program's output and the second program's output.\n\nHowever, the requirement says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we are only allowed to output the second program's output? \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nGiven the time, I decide to follow the requirement strictly: \n  - Only the first block reads input.\n  - Only the last block writes output.\n\nSo we must suppress the output of the first program and only use it to generate the input for the second program. Then the entire program only outputs the result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the behavior of the entire program should be:\n  - Read N, M and edges.\n  - If M is odd: then the first program would have output \"-1\", so we capture that and then the second program uses X = -1 and outputs the next prime (2). So we output 2.\n  - If M is even: the first program outputs a sequence of edges. We capture that output and then take the first token (the first integer of the first line) as X. Then we output the next prime >= X.\n\nBut note: in the even case, the first program outputs multiple lines. We are only interested in the first token of the entire output (which is the first integer of the first edge).\n\nHowever, we don't need to generate the entire output of the first program as strings. We only need the first token for the second program.\n\nBut what is that first token? It is the first number of the first edge that the first program prints.\n\nHow does the first program decide the order of edges?\n  The first program uses a heap to process nodes by degree. The first edge it prints is the first edge from the node with the smallest degree (and if there are ties, by node index?).\n\nBut note: the first program's output for the even case:\n\n  It initializes:\n    edges: list of sets for each node.\n    degs: degree count for each node.\n    parity: initially zeros.\n    flag: initially false.\n\n  Then it creates a heap of (degree, node) for all nodes.\n\n  Then it pops the smallest node (by degree, then by node index? because heapq in Python is min-heap and if degrees are equal, the node index is used? and if node indices are ordered, then the smallest node index?).\n\n  Let u be that node. Then it iterates over the edges from u. But note: the edges are stored in a set, and we iterate with `for i, v in enumerate(edges[u])` but sets are unordered in Python. So the order of edges is arbitrary? \n\nTherefore, the first token of the output is arbitrary? It could be either endpoint of the first edge printed.\n\nBut the second program uses that arbitrary number to compute a prime. So the entire output of the chain is non-deterministic? \n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem says to translate the entire sequence, I will assume that we are to capture the first integer that the first program would have printed. \n\nBut to avoid non-determinism, we must simulate the first program exactly, including the order of iteration over the set. However, the set in Python is unordered, but in practice for small integers it might iterate in sorted order? But we cannot rely on that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended a specific order? \n\nLooking at the first program: \n  It uses `for i, v in enumerate(edges[u]):` \n  and then condition: `if parity[u] != 0 and i == 0: ...`\n\nSo it uses the index i of the iteration. The first edge (i=0) is special. But the set iteration order is arbitrary.\n\nThis indicates that the program might be flawed. However, for the purpose of this translation, we must replicate the behavior. \n\nIn C, we can use a data structure that has a fixed order. The original Python uses a set. In C, we might use a hash set but then iteration order is undefined. Alternatively, we can try to use an ordered structure. But note: the problem does not specify the order.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem does not specify the order, I will assume that the order of iteration over the neighbors does not matter for the purpose of the first integer printed. \n\nBut wait: the first integer printed is either u+1 or v+1, depending on the condition. And the condition depends on `parity[u]` and `i==0`. \n\nSo it is critical to know the first element in the set.\n\nIn Python sets are unordered, but in the absence of a specified order, we can choose any order? But the program uses `enumerate` and then condition on `i==0`, so the first element in the iteration is important.\n\nTo make the behavior deterministic, we can sort the edges by the neighbor's index? But the original program doesn't sort.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same arbitrary order as in Python? This is difficult in C.\n\nGiven the time, I propose to change the first program to use a deterministic order: sort the set for iteration. But the problem says to translate, so we should not change the logic. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"behaves identically\". Without a defined order, it is impossible to replicate exactly.\n\nBut note: the first program in Python will have a specific order in practice for a given input due to the way Python sets are implemented. We cannot replicate that in C.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem is ambiguous, I decide to capture the first integer that the first program would print by simulating the first program and then extract the first integer without actually printing. And for that, we can choose any order as long as it is consistent with the algorithm? But the algorithm in the first program is not well-defined for order.\n\nWe must replicate the first program's behavior exactly. So we need to use the same order as in Python. \n\nTo do that, we can note that the first program uses a set. In Python, the iteration order of a set is the same as the order of insertion? Not necessarily. It depends on the hash.\n\nThis is very messy.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the order of iteration over the set is by the value of the vertex (i.e., we always iterate from smallest vertex to largest). This is what happens in practice for consecutive integers in Python sets? \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid generating the entire output and only focus on the first integer we would have printed.\n\nHow to get the first integer without generating the entire output? \n  We know that the first edge printed is from the node u with smallest degree (and then smallest index). Then it prints either (u+1, v+1) or (v+1, u+1) for the first edge in the iteration over edges[u]. \n\n  But what is the first edge in edges[u]? If we sort the set, we can choose the smallest vertex v in the set.\n\n  But the condition in the program uses the index i, not the value of v. \n\n  However, if we choose to iterate in sorted order by v, then we have a deterministic order.\n\nThis is a safe choice: in C, we can use a sorted data structure for the neighbors.\n\nBut note: the original program uses a set and does not sort. But to make the C program deterministic and to avoid undefined behavior, we will use a sorted order.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a linked list and always add at the end, and then iterate in the order of insertion. But the original program adds edges in the order of input? and then when removing, it might break the order? \n\nBut the input order is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the above, I decide to use a sorted order for the neighbors in the first program's simulation. This will give us a deterministic first token.\n\nTherefore, the plan for the C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read N, M.\n  Step 2: If M is odd, then we do:\n          We know the first program would have printed -1, so we set X = -1.\n  Step 3: If M is even, then we simulate the first program without printing, but we capture the first integer that would have been printed. How?\n          We need to know the first edge printed and which number comes first in that edge.\n          We simulate the algorithm of the first program, but when it is about to print the first edge, we record the first integer of that edge and then break? No, because we need to simulate the entire first program to get the state changes? \n\n  But note: the first program's algorithm:\n        It uses a heap (priority queue) to process nodes by degree (smallest first).\n        When it processes a node u (the smallest degree node that is not flagged), then it iterates over its neighbors. For each neighbor v, it removes u from v's neighbor set and then prints an edge. The first edge it prints is the first in the iteration.\n\n  However, after printing the first edge, it does not break; it continues to print all edges incident to u.\n\n  But we only care about the first integer printed in the entire output. So we can break after the first edge? But that would break the simulation because the entire state (removing edges, updating degrees and parity) must be done for all edges.\n\n  Therefore, we must simulate the entire first program, but without printing. Instead, we record the entire output in a buffer and then take the first integer? But the output is M lines. We only need the first token of the first line.\n\n  Alternatively, we can run the simulation until the first edge is printed and record that integer, and then continue the simulation without printing? \n\n  But note: the first integer printed is the first token of the entire output.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      We simulate the first program's algorithm, but we do not print. Instead, when it would have printed an edge, we capture the first integer of the first edge and then break out of the capture phase? But then we still need to complete the simulation for the rest of the graph? \n\n  However, the second program only uses that first integer. So we don't care about the rest of the output? \n\n  But the first program's algorithm updates the graph: it removes edges and updates degrees and parities. So we must complete the entire simulation to be faithful? \n\n  But note: the second program does not use the rest of the output. So we can avoid capturing the entire output? \n\n  However, the first program's algorithm must be run completely to update the graph state? Actually, no: the first program's algorithm is designed to output the entire set of edges in a particular orientation. But if we are not printing, we only care about the first token. But the first token is determined by the first edge printed, which is at the beginning of the simulation.\n\n  But the simulation of the entire graph might change if we break early? \n\n  Actually, the first edge printed is at the very first step: when we pop the first node u from the heap. Then we iterate over its neighbors. The first neighbor v in the iteration will yield the first edge.\n\n  However, after processing that first edge, we update the graph: remove the edge, update the degree of v, and update the parity of u or v. Then we push v with its new degree. Then we continue to the next neighbor.\n\n  But if we break after the first edge, we would not have updated the rest. And the state would be incomplete. Then when we try to continue the simulation for the next nodes, the state is corrupt.\n\n  Therefore, we must run the entire simulation of the first program to correctly update the graph? But the second program does not care. \n\n  However, the first token is fixed at the first edge. The rest of the simulation does not affect that first token.\n\n  But note: the first program's output is fixed at the time of printing. The first token is the first number of the first edge, and that is determined by the first step.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Run the first program's algorithm completely, but without printing. While running, when we would have printed the very first edge, record the first integer of that edge. We don't care about the rest.\n\n  How to know it is the very first edge? We can set a flag: captured = false. When we are about to print the first edge (and captured is false), then capture the first integer and set captured = true. Then continue the simulation without printing.\n\n  But note: the first program might print multiple edges. We only need the first token of the first edge.\n\n  So we can capture only the first integer of the first edge and ignore the rest.\n\n  However, the algorithm might print an edge in one of two formats:\n        Format 1: (u+1, v+1) -> so the first integer is u+1.\n        Format 2: (v+1, u+1) -> so the first integer is v+1.\n\n  We capture that integer and then continue the simulation without printing.\n\n  Step 4: Then we run the second program with X = the captured integer (if M is even) or X = -1 (if M is odd).\n\n  Step 5: Then we output the next prime >= X.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program doesn't print any edge? That happens if M is 0? Then the first program would not enter the while loop? Then we would never capture an integer? \n\n  If M is even and M==0, then the while loop doesn't run. So the first program outputs nothing. Then the second program would read an empty input? Then input() would fail? \n\n  In Python, input() would raise EOFError. But the second program doesn't handle that. It would crash.\n\n  In our C program, if M==0, then we capture nothing? Then what should X be? \n\n  We can handle it by: if M==0, then the first program outputs nothing, so the second program would read from an empty stdin and fail. But in our simulation, we set X to an arbitrary value? \n\n  Actually, the problem says \"the entire sequence\". So we must mimic the crash? Or the problem inputs might not include M==0.\n\nGiven the complexity, and to keep it simple, we'll assume that if M is even and positive, we capture the first integer. If M==0, then the first program outputs nothing, so the second program would not read any integer? Then we should not run the second program? But the problem says the second program runs.\n\n  Alternatively, we can note that if the first program outputs nothing, then the second program's input is empty. Then the second program would try to read an integer and fail. In C, if we try to read an integer and fail, we should output nothing? or an error? \n\n  But the problem says the second program outputs a prime. So it would find a prime? \n\n  Actually, the second program reads X = int(input()). If input() fails, it would throw an exception and exit without output? \n\n  We are not required to handle that? \n\n  Since the problem is ambiguous, I will assume that M>=0 and that if M==0, then the first program outputs nothing, so we set X to a default value? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  Given the time, I will assume that M is at least 0, and if M==0, then we set X = 0? But that is arbitrary.\n\n  Alternatively, we can run the second program only if we have captured an integer? But the first program might output nothing only when M==0.\n\n  But note: the first program only outputs nothing when M==0? because if M>0 and even, then it outputs M edges.\n\n  Therefore, if M==0, then the first program outputs nothing, so the second program would read nothing? and then the second program would break. In the second program, the input() would return nothing, and then int() would fail? \n\n  We are not required to handle that? \n\n  For simplicity, in the C program, if M is even and M==0, then we won't capture any integer. So we set X = 0? \n\n  But the second program in Python would crash. In C, we want to avoid a crash? \n\n  Given the requirement to output the same as the chain, we must crash? But that is not user-friendly.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem inputs might avoid M==0.\n\nAfter careful thought, I will do:\n\n  if M % 2 != 0:\n      X = -1;\n  else:\n      if M == 0:\n          // Then the first program outputs nothing. The second program would try to read and fail.\n          // In C, we can simulate by not providing a number? But then the second part would fail.\n          // However, the problem says the entire chain. So we should output nothing? or output the prime for X=0? \n          // But the second program would not have read anything. \n          // Let's set X = 0? \n          X = 0;\n      else:\n          // simulate the first program until the first edge is printed and capture the first integer.\n          X = captured_integer;\n\n  Then run the second program with X.\n\nBut note: in the second program, if X=0, then it would mark 0 as non-prime and then look for the next prime >=0 -> which is 2.\n\nBut the original second program, if given no input, would crash. So the entire chain would crash. \n\nTherefore, to mimic the crash, in C we could try to read from stdin again? but we are not allowed: the requirement says only the first block reads input.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will assume that M>0 in the even case, and M>=1 in the odd case. The problem does not specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the first program when M==0 would not enter the for-loop and then not the while-loop. So the captured_integer is never set. So we must set X to an uninitialized value? That is not good.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that M>=1.\n\nBut the problem says: M is the number of edges, and the input format: first line is N and M, then M edges. So M can be 0.\n\nTo handle M==0 in the even case:\n\n  We know that the first program outputs nothing. So the second program would read from an empty input. In C, if we try to read an integer from stdin when there is none, it would fail. But the problem says we already read all the input in the first block. So there is no more input. \n\n  Then the second program would fail to read. \n\n  Therefore, we should not set X to anything? and then the second program would read nothing? \n\n  How does the second program work in C? We can simulate the second program without reading from stdin? because we are to use the captured output of the first program. And if the first program output nothing, then the second program has no input.\n\n  So we can do: if M is even and M==0, then we do not run the second program? But the problem says the entire sequence.\n\n  Given the time, I will output 2 in the even case if M==0? because the next prime>=0 is 2? \n\n  But that is not what the original chain does.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might not have intended M==0.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem is ambiguous, I decide to assume that M>=0. For M==0 and even, we set X=0 and then find the next prime>=0 (which is 2).\n\nNow, the C program structure:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <stdbool.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  // We need a priority queue (min-heap) for the first program.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read N, M.\n  2. If M is odd: \n        X = -1;\n  3. If M is even:\n        If M==0:\n            X = 0;\n        Else:\n            // Build the graph: \n            //   We'll have arrays for edges. Since we need to remove edges, we use dynamic structures.\n            //   We'll use linked lists for the neighbors? But then removal is O(n). Alternatively, we use a set of some kind.\n            //   We can use a 2D array? But we don't know the maximum degree.\n\n            // Instead, we can use an array of linked lists for the adjacency list.\n\n            // We need to:\n            //   - Represent the graph: for each node, a list of neighbors.\n            //   - We also want to be able to remove an edge (u, v) from v's list.\n\n            // But note: the first program uses sets. We can use a balanced BST? In C, we don't have one. \n            //   Alternatively, we can use an array for each node and then sort it to get a deterministic order.\n\n            // We decide: for each node, we maintain a sorted array? But then removal is O(n). Or we use a BST library? We don't want to.\n\n            // Since the maximum N is not given, but the prime array in the second program goes up to 100010, we assume N up to 100000.\n\n            // We'll use an array of dynamic arrays for the graph.\n\n            // Steps for building the graph for the first program:\n            //   edges = (array of arrays) of size N.\n            //   degs = array of int of size N.\n            //   parity = array of int of size N (initialize to 0).\n            //   flag = array of bool of size N (initialize to false).\n\n            // Then we read M edges.\n\n            // For each edge (a,b):\n            //   a0 = a-1, b0 = b-1.\n            //   Add b0 to edges[a0] and a0 to edges[b0].\n            //   Increment degs[a0] and degs[b0].\n\n            // Then we build a min-heap for (degs[i], i) for i in [0, N-1].\n\n            // Then we simulate the heap process.\n\n            // But we want to iterate over the neighbors in a sorted order? Let's sort the array for each node.\n\n            // For each node, after reading, sort its neighbor array.\n\n            // Then, when processing a node u, we iterate over the neighbor array (which is sorted) and then remove the edge from the other side.\n\n            // How to remove an edge from node v? We must remove u from the array of v. We can do by searching in the sorted array and then removing that element.\n\n            // We also need to maintain the sorted order.\n\n            // But removal in an array is O(deg(v)).\n\n            // Since the total number of edges is M, and each edge is removed once, the total cost is O(M * deg) which might be O(M*N) in the worst-case? \n\n            // Alternatively, we can use a linked list and then mark the edge as removed? But then the iteration would skip.\n\n            // Or we can use a balanced BST, but we don't have one.\n\n            // Given the constraints (N up to 100000) but M up to 100000, the worst-case degree might be high.\n\n            // However, we can use a more efficient data structure. We can use a double linked list for each node's neighbors? \n\n            // But for simplicity, we use an array and when we remove an element, we swap with the last and then re-sort? That would be expensive.\n\n            // Alternatively, we can avoid removal by marking. We'll have an array of arrays, and also an array of pointers to the current size. Then when we iterate, we skip removed edges? But then the array is not sorted anymore.\n\n            // Given the time, we will use an array for each node and sort it initially. Then when we remove an edge (u from v's list), we do a linear scan to remove. Then we sort again? That would be O(deg(v) + deg(v) log deg(v)) per removal, which is too heavy.\n\n            // We need a better way.\n\n            // Instead, we can use a global marker for removed edges? Or we can use a set structure that is a balanced BST. We can use a tree, but we are in C.\n\n            // Alternatively, we can note that we only care about the first edge printed. So we can break after the first edge? But then the entire simulation is not done, and the state is not updated for the rest, which might affect the first edge? It doesn't: the first edge is printed based on the initial state.\n\n            // But wait: the condition for printing the edge uses `parity[u]` and the index i. The parity[u] is initially 0, so the first edge is printed in the second format: (v+1, u+1) -> so the first integer is v+1.\n\n            // And v is the first neighbor in the sorted order.\n\n            // And the parity[u] is not updated until after the first edge? Let me see the code:\n\n            //   if parity[u] != 0 and i==0: \n            //        print(u+1, v+1)\n            //        parity[u] = 1 - parity[u]\n            //   else:\n            //        print(v+1, u+1)\n            //        parity[v] = 1 - parity[v]\n\n            // Since initially parity[u] is 0, we always take the else branch for the first edge.\n\n            // So the first integer printed is v+1, where v is the first neighbor in the iteration.\n\n            // And the iteration is in sorted order (because we sorted the neighbor array).\n\n            // Then, after printing, we update: parity[v] = 1 - parity[v] = 1.\n\n            // But note: we are not printing, so we only care about the first integer.\n\n            // However, the first integer is v+1, where v is the smallest neighbor of the node u with smallest (degree, index).\n\n            // Therefore, we can do:\n\n            //   Find the node u with the smallest degree (and then smallest index).\n            //   Sort the list of neighbors of u.\n            //   Let v = the smallest neighbor.\n            //   Then the first integer printed is v+1.\n\n            // But wait: what if there are multiple nodes with the same degree and we use a heap? We might not have processed the node with the smallest index first? \n\n            // How is the heap defined: \n            //   We push (degs[i], i) for each node i.\n            //   Then we pop the smallest degs[i], and if there are ties, the smallest i? \n\n            //   But the heap in Python is not stable beyond the first element. In C, we can do the same: we will have a heap that is a min-heap by degree, and then by node index.\n\n            //   However, our capture only requires the first node u.\n\n            //   So we can find the node u with the smallest degree, and if there are ties, the smallest index.\n\n            //   Then we get its smallest neighbor v.\n\n            //   Then X = v+1.\n\n            //   But is this enough? \n\n            //   What if after we remove the edge (u,v), the graph changes and then the next node might be different? But the first integer is fixed.\n\n            //   Therefore, we do not need to simulate the entire first program. We only need to:\n            //        - Find the node u that is the first to be popped from the heap initially.\n            //        - Then find the smallest neighbor v of u.\n            //        - Then X = v+1.\n\n            //   But note: what if the first node u has no neighbor? That cannot happen because we are popping a node with the smallest degree. If the degree is 0, then it has no neighbor. Then we would not print any edge? \n\n            //   But if M>0, there must be a node with degree>0. And the first node we pop might have degree>0.\n\n            //   But what if there are nodes with degree 0? Then the heap might have them. Then we pop a node with degree 0? Then we skip because we set flag[u]=true and then we continue. Then we pop the next node.\n\n            //   Therefore, we must simulate the heap until we find a node with at least one neighbor.\n\n            //   But note: the first program's heap might pop a node with degree 0 and then skip it. Then it pops the next node.\n\n            //   So we cannot just take the very first node.\n\n            //   We must simulate the heap popping until we find a node with deg>0 and not flagged? But initially, no node is flagged.\n\n            //   And initially, the degs might be 0 for some nodes.\n\n            //   So we need to:\n\n            //        Build a min-heap of (degs[i], i) for i in [0, N-1].\n            //        Then pop nodes until we find one that is not flagged and has deg>0? But the first program does not check deg>0, it only checks flag. And initially, no node is flagged.\n\n            //        So it will pop the node with smallest degree. If that node has degree 0, then we skip and pop the next.\n\n            //   Therefore, we must find the first node u (by the heap order) that has deg>0.\n\n            //   Then we get its smallest neighbor v.\n\n            //   Then X = v+1.\n\n            //   But note: the first program might have updated the degrees of some nodes during the simulation of other nodes? before we get to the first edge? \n\n            //   However, we are only at the beginning. The first program has not processed any node yet. So the degrees are the initial ones.\n\n            //   Therefore, we can do:\n\n            //        Find the node u with the smallest non-zero degree, and if there are ties, the smallest node index.\n\n            //        How to do that: \n            //            We iterate over the nodes and find the node with the smallest non-zero degree, and among those, the smallest index.\n\n            //        Then we sort the list of neighbors of u and take the smallest neighbor v.\n\n            //        Then X = v+1.\n\n            //   But wait: the heap is not necessarily giving the smallest index in case of ties in degree? \n\n            //   The heap in Python is a min-heap by the first element, and if the first elements are equal, it compares the second element? \n\n            //   In the first program, the heap stores (d, i). And in Python, if two tuples have the same d, then i is compared. And it pops the one with the smallest i.\n\n            //   So we want the node with the smallest d, and if there are ties, smallest i.\n\n            //   And we want the first node with d>0.\n\n            //   We can do: \n            //        min_degree = a big number\n            //        candidate = -1\n            //        for i from 0 to N-1:\n            //            if degs[i] > 0 and degs[i] < min_degree, then candidate = i, min_degree = degs[i]\n            //            if degs[i] == min_degree and i < candidate, then candidate = i\n            //        u = candidate\n\n            //   Then, sort the edges[u] (which is the list of neighbors) and take the smallest neighbor v.\n\n            //   Then X = v+1.\n\n            //   But note: what if the node u has been flagged? But initially, none are flagged.\n\n            //   This seems to work.\n\n  4. Then X = (if M is odd: -1, else: if M==0, then 0, else: v+1)\n\n  5. Then run the second program: \n        We need to find the next prime >= X.\n\n        We know that the second program uses a sieve up to 100009.\n\n        Steps for the second program:\n            - Create a boolean array `prime` of size 100010.\n            - Mark 0 and 1 as false.\n            - Mark even numbers (>=4) as false.\n            - Mark multiples of odd numbers starting from 3.\n            - Then scan from X up to 100007 to find the first prime.\n\n  6. Print that prime.\n\nBut wait: what if X is greater than 100007? The second program scans up to 100007. In the Python program, the range is `for i in range(X, 100008)`. The upper bound is 100008, but the prime array goes to index 100009. So it will scan up to 100007? \n\n  Note: the Python range is exclusive of the upper bound. So it scans from X to 100007 (inclusive of X, exclusive of 100008). So if X>100007, the loop doesn't run and it doesn't find a prime? \n\n  But the problem says the next prime >= X, and the next prime might be beyond 100007? \n\n  However, the sieve is only built for 0..100009. And the loop scans from X to 100007. \n\n  If X is 100008 or 100009, then the loop doesn't run, and it doesn't find a prime? \n\n  But the sieve has prime[100009] = ? \n\n  The sieve in the second program marks indices up to 100009. But the loop only goes to 100007. \n\n  Therefore, if X is 100008, then the loop runs from 100008 to 100007 -> which is an empty range. Then it breaks and prints nothing? \n\n  But the problem says it breaks after finding the first prime. \n\n  In the Python program, if X=100008, then the loop runs from 100008 to 100007, which is empty. Then it does nothing and the program ends without output? \n\n  That is a flaw in the second program.\n\n  But the problem says to translate, so we replicate the flaw.\n\n  In the second program, the sieve is built for indices 0 to 100009, but the loop only checks up to 100007. So it will miss 100008 and 100009.\n\n  We should change the loop to go to 100010? \n\n  But to be faithful, we do the same.\n\n  In the C program, we'll build the sieve for [0, 100009], and then scan from X to 100007.\n\n  If we don't find a prime in [X, 100007], then the program outputs nothing? \n\n  But the original chain would output nothing.\n\n  Given the requirement, we output nothing? \n\n  But the problem might not have such large X.\n\n  Alternatively, the first integer from the first program is at most N, and N is the number of vertices. The problem does not specify N, but the sieve is built for 100010, so we assume N<=100000.\n\n  So X = v+1, and v is a vertex index, so 0<=v<=N-1, so X is between 1 and N, and N<=100000. So we are safe.\n\n  Similarly, if M is odd, X=-1, and if M is even and 0, X=0, and both -1 and 0 are within the sieve range.\n\n  Therefore, the scan from X to 100007 will always find a prime? because there are primes in that range.\n\n  For example, the largest prime below 100008 is 100003.\n\n  So it's safe.\n\n  But note: if X is 100008, then we would not find a prime? but X is at most 100000, so it's safe.\n\n  Similarly, if X is negative, we scan from -1 to 100007 and find 2.\n\n  So the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <stdbool.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      #define MAX_SIZE 100010\n\n      // For the second program: sieve up to MAX_SIZE-1\n      bool prime[MAX_SIZE];\n\n      void init_sieve() {\n          // prime[0] = false; prime[1] = false;\n          prime[0] = false;\n          prime[1] = false;\n          // Mark even numbers (>=4) as false\n          for (int i = 2; i < MAX_SIZE; i++) {\n              prime[i] = true;\n          }\n          for (int i = 4; i < MAX_SIZE; i+=2) {\n              prime[i] = false;\n          }\n          // Sieve for odd numbers\n          for (int i = 3; i*i < MAX_SIZE; i+=2) {\n              if (prime[i]) {\n                  for (int j = i+i; j < MAX_SIZE; j+=i) {\n                      prime[j] = false;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int N, M;\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n          // If M is odd\n          if (M % 2 != 0) {\n              // We would have printed -1 in the first program, so X = -1.\n              int X = -1;\n              // Then run the second program: find the next prime >= X\n              init_sieve();\n              // Scan from X to 100007 (inclusive) for a prime.\n              for (int i = X; i < 100008; i++) {\n                  // We must be careful: i might be negative.

We are scanning for the minimum.\n\n  However, I already replaced the qsort with a simple scan.\n\n  And note: the first program might have updated the degrees during the simulation, but we are not simulating beyond the initial state. We are only taking the initial state to find the first integer.\n\n  And the condition in the first program for the first edge is always the else branch, so the first integer is the neighbor+1.\n\n  Therefore, this should work.\n\n  But note: the first program might have popped a node with degree 0 first, but we are only considering nodes with positive degree. And we find the candidate with the smallest positive degree and smallest index. This matches the first node that would have been popped and then processed (not skipped).\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Let me test with a small example.\n\n  Example: N=2, M=1 (but M is even? so this example is invalid). \n\n  Example: N=3, M=2: edges (1,2) and (1,3)\n\n  Then:\n      degs: \n          node0 (vertex1): deg=2\n          node1 (vertex2): deg=1\n          node2 (vertex3): deg=1\n\n      The smallest non-zero degree is 1, and there are two nodes: node1 and node2. We choose the smallest index: node1.\n\n      Then we look at its neighbors: only node0? \n          edges[1] = [0] \n      So the smallest neighbor is 0.\n      Then X = 0+1 = 1.\n\n      Then the second program: next prime>=1 -> 2.\n\n      Output: 2.\n\n  But what would the first program have printed?\n      The first program would have built a heap: \n          (2,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n      Pop the smallest: (1,1) -> then process node1.\n          Iterate over its neighbors: set is {0}. \n          Since parity[1] is 0, it prints (v+1, u+1) = (1, 2) -> so the first integer is 1.\n      Then the second program would have read 1 and then output 2.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Example: N=3, M=2: edges (2,3) and (1,2) -> then node0: {1} -> deg=1, node1: {0,2} -> deg=2, node2: {1} -> deg=1.\n      The smallest non-zero degree is 1. Candidates: node0 and node2. We choose node0 (smaller index).\n      Its neighbors: [1] -> smallest neighbor=1 -> X=1+1=2.\n      Then the second program: next prime>=2 is 2.\n\n  What would the first program have printed?\n      Heap: (1,0), (2,1), (1,2)\n      Pop node0: deg=1, then for its only neighbor (node1): \n          prints (1+1, 0+1) = (2,1) -> first integer=2.\n      Then the second program outputs 2.\n\n  It matches.\n\n  But wait: the first program then continues to process node1? but we don't care.\n\n  So we are only capturing the first integer.\n\n  Therefore, the C program below.\n\n  Note: We must free memory in the even M>0 case.\n\n  Also, we assume that the graph has no self-loops? and that the input is valid.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      if (M % 2 != 0) {\n          // Set X = -1, then run the second program.\n      } else {\n          if (M == 0) {\n              // Set X = 0\n          } else {\n              // Build graph and find X.\n          }\n      }\n\n  Then run the second program with X.\n\n  We'll factor out the second program as a function? or just duplicate the code.\n\n  We'll do duplicated code for clarity.\n\n  Note: the second program's sieve can be built once.\n\n  We'll build the sieve after we know X? because if M is odd, we build it for the first time, and if M is even, we build it after the graph.\n\n  But we can build it at the beginning? \n\n  The problem does not specify performance. The sieve is built for 100010, which is fixed.\n\n  We can build it once at the beginning.\n\n  Revised plan:\n\n      Build the sieve at the beginning.\n\n      Then read N, M.\n\n      Then if M is odd: X = -1.\n      Else if M==0: X = 0.\n      Else: \n          Build the graph for the first program and find X = smallest_neighbor + 1 of the candidate node.\n\n      Then, scan from X to 100007 for a prime.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <stdbool.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      #define MAX_SIZE 100010\n\n      bool prime[MAX_SIZE];\n\n      void init_sieve() {\n          // Initialize the prime array\n          for (int i = 0;

The original Python program:\n\n  prime = [True] * (100010)\n  prime[0] = False\n  prime[1] = False\n  for i in range(4, 100010, 2):\n      prime[i] = False\n  i = 3\n  while (i * i <= 100008):\n      if prime[i]:\n          for j in range(i + i, 100008, i):\n              prime[j] = False\n      i += 2\n\n  We did:\n\n      for (int i = 3; i * i < MAX_SIZE; i+=2) {\n          if (prime[i]) {\n              for (int j = i*i; j < MAX_SIZE; j += i) {\n                  prime[j] = false;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n  This is more optimized. But the original starts j from i+i. We start from i*i, which is correct.\n\n  Also, the upper bound for the while loop in Python is i*i<=100008, which is the same as i*i < 100009? \n\n  And our MAX_SIZE is 100010, so we cover up to 100009.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  We'll go with this code.\n\n  However, note: the second program in Python marks multiples starting from i+i, but we start at i*i. \n  But the multiples below i*i would have been marked by smaller primes. So it is correct.\n\n  Let me test the sieve for a small number.\n\n  Therefore, the final C program."
