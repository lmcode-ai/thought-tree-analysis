If no non-outdated item is found, then ans1 remains 0. So we must handle 0. How about we output the same as the chain? The chain for 0 would hang. So our program must hang. We write:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n      if (n2 == 1) {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\n  For n2=0: the while loop runs forever -> program hangs -> same as the chain. But note: the second program in the chain (Python) would run the while loop forever? Yes, because 0%2==0 is always true and 0/2 is 0. So it never breaks. Therefore, we do not need to change the while loop. However, we must be cautious: if the compiler optimizes the loop? It might notice that n2 is 0 and the loop condition is always true? But the behavior is undefined? Actually, the standard says that an infinite loop with no side effects is undefined behavior? To avoid undefined behavior, we can do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n          // We can add a dummy side effect? But the problem says to behave identically.\n      }\n\n  Alternatively, we note that the problem does not require to run in a defined way by the C standard? We just require the same observable behavior. But the observable behavior is that it runs forever. So we can leave it as:\n\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  And hope that the compiler does not optimize it?

No, we must not break.\n      } Actually, the standard says that if the program has an infinite loop with no observable behavior (like I/O or volatile accesses), then it is undefined. To make it defined, we can use a volatile variable? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (1) {\n          if (n2 % 2 != 0) break;\n          if (n2 == 0) {\n              // We are going to loop forever?

It will still do the division and set to 0, then next iteration: 0%2==0 -> true, then we enter the if (n2==0) again? So it's an infinite loop? Actually, the condition of the while loop is checked at every iteration. So for n2=0, we enter the loop body, then we check if n2==0 (which is true) and then we do nothing, then we set n2 = 0/2 -> 0. Then we check again: 0%2==0 -> true, and so on. So it's an infinite loop. But that is the same as without the if.",

The problem doesn't say. But the first program: the input n is the first integer. Then we read n lines. So n is at most, say, 1000? 10000? Therefore, the index (ans1) is at most 10000? So we don't have to worry about big integers. The second program will get an integer at most 10000, which is small. Therefore, we can safely use integer arithmetic in C.\n\n  Steps in code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n1;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n          // Define a struct for the item\n          typedef struct {\n              int s, r, h, c;\n          } Item;\n\n          Item* arr = (Item*)malloc(n1 * sizeof(Item));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d % d % d %d\", &arr[i].s, &arr[i].r, &arr[i].h, &arr[i].c);\n          }\n\n          // Create an array to mark outdated (1 for outdated, 0 for not)\n          int* outdated = (int*)calloc(n1, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n\n          // Check for outdated items: for each i, if there exists j such that arr[j] is strictly superior in s, r, h, then mark i as outdated. for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < n1; j++) {\n                  if (i == j) continue;\n                  if (arr[j].s > arr[i].s && arr[j].r > arr[i].r && arr[j].h > arr[i].h) {\n                      outdated[i] = 1;\n                      break; // no need to check other j for this i\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          int min_cost = 100000; // as in the Python code\n          int ans1 = 0; // will be the 1-based index of the chosen item, 0 if none\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              if (outdated[i] == 0) {\n                  if (arr[i].c < min_cost) {\n                      min_cost = arr[i].c;\n                      ans1 = i+1;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now, free the memory we don't need anymore\n          free(arr);\n          free(outdated);\n\n          // Second part: use ans1 as the input to the second program\n          long long n2 = ans1;   // we use long long to be safe for division? but ans1 is at most 10000\n\n          // If we are concerned about the infinite loop for 0, we note that the problem says to behave identically. while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      } However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then we get an infinite loop and the program never reaches the print. So we are good. But note: the first program in the chain outputs 0, then the second program runs and gets stuck in the while loop. So the entire chain does not produce any output and runs forever. Our C program does the same. Therefore, we are done. But note: the Python program for the first part uses a set for outdated? We are using an array of booleans. The logic is the same. Let me test with a small example:\n\n      n1 = 2\n      Item0: (1,1,1,10)\n      Item1: (2,2,2,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: check j=1: (2>1,2>1,2>1) -> true, so mark outdated[0]=1. for i=1: check j=0: (1<2, ...) -> no, and j=1: skip? so outdated[1]=0. Then we look for non-outdated: only index1 -> cost=5 -> ans1 = 1+1 = 2. Then second part: n2=2 -> even -> n2=1 -> then 1%2 ! =0 -> break -> n2==1 -> print \"YES\". That matches. Another test: two items that are not comparable? Item0: (1,2,3,10)\n      Item1: (2,1,2,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: compare to j=1: 2>1, 1<2 -> not all greater -> so not outdated by j=1.\n      for i=1: compare to j=0: 1<2, 2>1 -> not all greater -> so not outdated. Then we have two non-outdated. We choose the one with minimum cost: min_cost=5 (item1) -> ans1=2. Then second part: 2 -> becomes 1 -> YES. Another test: no non-outdated? n1=1: only one item: \n          Then for i=0: no j (because j from 0 to 0, but skip i=j) -> outdated[0]=0? Then we choose it: ans1=1. Then second part: 1 -> not even -> then n2=1 -> YES. But wait: with one item, it should be non-outdated? However, what if we have two items that are identical? Item0: (1,1,1,10)\n      Item1: (1,1,1,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: compare to j=1: we require strictly greater? (1>1, 1>1, 1>1) -> false -> so not outdated. Similarly, for i=1: compare to j=0: false. Then we have two non-outdated. We choose the one with min cost: item1 -> ans1=2. Then second part: 2 -> becomes 1 -> YES. But note: the condition in the first program is:",

So they are not outdated. Therefore, our C program matches. Edge: n1=0? The first program: \n          n = 0 -> input_array is empty. Then the loop for outdated: no iterations -> outdated remains empty set. Then the next loop: for i in range(0) -> no iterations -> ans1 remains 0. Then second part: 0 -> infinite loop. So our program must handle n1=0? We read n1=0, then we try to allocate arr for 0 elements? That is safe. Then the loops run 0 times. Then we set ans1=0. Then the while loop runs infinitely. Therefore, we are set. Final code: We include the necessary headers and write the code as above. Note: We use long long for n2?",

(because no other item) -> then we check: cost=100000 < 100000? false -> ans1=0. Then second part: infinite loop. That matches the original: the first program would output 0.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs to be executed in sequence.\n The first program reads an integer `n`, then `n` lines of four integers each (S, R, H, C). \n It then computes which items are outdated (an item is outdated if there exists another item that is strictly superior in S, R, H).\n Then it finds the non-outdated item with the smallest cost (C) and prints its 1-based index.\n\n The second program reads an integer `n` (which in the chain will be the output of the first program, i.e., the input_number).\n Then it checks if `n` is a power of two by continuously dividing by 2 until it is odd. If the result is 1, it prints 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\n However, note that the first program prints an integer (input_number) and the second program reads that integer.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain is:\n   Input for the first program: \n        n\n        followed by n lines of four integers.\n\n   Output of the first program: an integer (input_number)\n\n   The second program then uses that integer as its input and outputs either 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\n We must write a single C program that does the following:\n   - Reads the initial input (n and the n lines of four integers) for the first part.\n   - Processes the first part to compute the integer (input_number) without printing it in the middle.\n   - Then uses that integer as the input to the second part (without reading again from stdin until the second part? but note the second part only reads one integer).\n   - The second part then prints either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n However, note that the second program in the chain normally would read from stdin, but in our chain the first program's output is the input to the second. \n But in the single C program, we don't output the intermediate result. Instead, we use the computed value (input_number) as the input for the second part.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the initial integer (let's call it `n1`).\n 2. Read `n1` lines, each containing four integers: S, R, H, C. Store them in an array of tuples (or structs).\n\n 3. For the first part:\n      - Create an array (or list) `input_array` of the data.\n      - Create a set (or mark) for outdated items. We can use an array of booleans (outdated[i] = true if item i is outdated).\n      - For each i, for each j, check if item j is strictly superior to item i in S, R, H.\n      - Then, traverse the non-outdated items to find the one with minimum cost and note its 1-based index.\n\n 4. The result of the first part is an integer `input_number` (the index).\n\n 5. For the second part:\n      - Take the value `input_number` (which is an integer) and assign it to a variable (say `n2`).\n      - While `n2` is even, divide by 2.\n      - If the result is 1, print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n Important: The first part must not output anything until the very end of the entire program? Actually, the entire chain only outputs at the last step (the second part). But note the first program in the chain outputs the input_number, which is then read by the second. However, in the combined C program, we are going to skip printing that intermediate value and use it directly for the second part.\n\n Therefore, we do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial data (n and the n lines) for the first program.\n\n   Step 2: Compute the intermediate result (the index of the non-outdated item with minimum cost) and store it in a variable, say `ans1`.\n\n   Step 3: Use `ans1` as the input to the second program (so we set `n2 = ans1`).\n\n   Step 4: Run the second program on `n2` and then output the result (\"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n But note: the second program in the chain reads from stdin, but in our combined program we are not going to read again until the second part? Actually, we have already read all the data for the first part. The second part only needs one integer, which we have computed (ans1). So we do not read again.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll use a struct for the quadruple.\n\n   Steps for the first part:\n\n      int n1;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n      struct Item { int s, r, h, c; };\n      struct Item* arr = (struct Item*)malloc(n1 * sizeof(struct Item));\n\n      for (int i=0; i<n1; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &arr[i].s, &arr[i].r, &arr[i].h, &arr[i].c);\n      }\n\n      // We'll create an array to mark outdated items (by index). Let outdated[i] = 1 if outdated, else 0.\n      int* outdated = (int*)calloc(n1, sizeof(int)); // initialized to 0.\n\n      for (int i=0; i<n1; i++) {\n          for (int j=0; j<n1; j++) {\n              if (i == j) continue;\n              if (arr[j].s > arr[i].s && arr[j].r > arr[i].r && arr[j].h > arr[i].h) {\n                  outdated[i] = 1;\n                  break; // once we know it's outdated, break inner loop for this i\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Now find the non-outdated item with minimum cost and note the smallest index? Actually, we note the 1-based index of the first occurrence of the minimum cost? \n      // But note: we are to choose the non-outdated item with the smallest cost. If there are multiple, we choose the first one? Actually, the original program:\n      //   minimum_cost = 100000\n      //   input_number = 0\n      //   for i in range(n):\n      //       current_item = input_array[i]\n      //       cost = current_item[3]\n      //       if (current_item not in outdated and cost < minimum_cost):\n      //           minimum_cost = cost\n      //           input_number = i+1\n      // So it picks the first item that has the smallest cost (because we update only when we find a smaller cost).\n\n      int min_cost = 100000; // as in the Python code\n      int ans1 = 0; // the index we will pass to the second part (0 means not found, but the problem should have at least one non-outdated?).\n\n      for (int i=0; i<n1; i++) {\n          if (outdated[i] == 0) {\n              if (arr[i].c < min_cost) {\n                  min_cost = arr[i].c;\n                  ans1 = i+1; // 1-based index\n              }\n          }\n      }\n\n   Step 4: Now we have ans1, which is the integer that the second program would read.\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;   // note: the second program reads an integer, but we are going to use the integer we computed.\n\n      // However, the second program does: \n      //   n = int(input())\n      //   while n % 2 == 0: n /= 2\n      //   if n == 1: print('YES') else: print('NO')\n\n      // But note: the integer we have (ans1) might be 0? The problem states there is at least one non-outdated? But if there is none, then ans1 remains 0. \n      // In the original, if no non-outdated item is found, then input_number remains 0? Then the second program would get 0.\n\n      // Let's simulate the second program on 0:\n      //   while 0 % 2 == 0 -> true, then 0/2 -> 0 -> infinite loop? \n      // But in the original, if no non-outdated item was found, the first program outputs 0. Then the second program would read 0 and then get stuck in an infinite loop? \n\n      // However, the problem states: the first program prints the input_number (which is 0 if none found). But the second program is not designed for 0.\n\n      // We must note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So if the first program outputs 0, the second program gets 0.\n\n      // How does the second program handle 0?\n      //   while n % 2 == 0: 0%2 is 0 -> true, then n = 0/2 -> 0.0, then assigned to integer? In Python, 0//2 is 0? Actually, in Python, 0/2 is 0.0, but then converting to integer? Actually, the input is read as integer so n=0. Then the loop: 0%2==0 -> True, then n = n//2? Actually, the division in the Python program is integer division? But note: in Python 3, `n /= 2` would be float? \n\n      // Let me check: \n      //   n = 0 (integer)\n      //   n % 2 -> 0, so condition true.\n      //   n /= 2 -> becomes 0.0 (float) then next iteration: 0.0 % 2 -> 0.0 % 2.0 -> 0.0, then again ... infinite loop? \n\n      // But wait, the original program uses `n = int(input())` so n is integer. Then in the loop, `n /= 2` would produce a float? Actually, in Python, the division operator `/` produces a float. Then `n` becomes a float and then `n % 2` for a float? \n\n      // However, the condition `n % 2 == 0` for n=0.0: 0.0 % 2.0 is 0.0, which is 0. So condition true. Then we set n = 0.0/2 -> 0.0. So infinite loop.\n\n      // But the problem says: we must behave identically. However, in C we can avoid the infinite loop by using integer arithmetic? \n\n      // Actually, the original Python program for the second part is:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          while n % 2 == 0:\n              n /= 2\n\n      // This is problematic because if n is 0, it becomes an infinite loop. Also, if n is negative? The problem states the first program outputs an index (nonnegative, and 0 if none found). \n\n      // How should we handle 0? The problem says: the first program outputs 0 if no non-outdated item is found. Then the second program would run forever? But that is the behavior.\n\n      // However, in the competition problem, it is guaranteed that there is at least one non-outdated? Or the problem says the first program prints 0? Then we must simulate the infinite loop? \n\n      // But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are not required to fix bugs. However, the problem states that the chain is run as is.\n\n      // But wait: the first program sets minimum_cost to 100000 and then if no non-outdated is found, then the condition `if (current_item not in outdated and cost < minimum_cost)` is never met, so ans1 remains 0.\n\n      // How does the second program run with 0? It runs forever. So our C program would also run forever? \n\n      // However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically\". So we must also run forever? But that is not acceptable.\n\n      // Alternatively, note the original chain: the first program outputs 0, then the second program reads 0 and then goes into an infinite loop. So we must do the same.\n\n      // But we are writing a C program. We can do:\n\n          long long n2 = ans1;   // use long long to avoid overflow? but the numbers are not huge.\n\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n\n      // However, if n2 is 0, then 0%2==0 -> true, then n2 becomes 0/2=0 -> infinite loop.\n\n      // So that matches.\n\n      // But note: if n2 is negative? The first program outputs a nonnegative integer (index from 0 to n, but if not found 0). So we are safe.\n\n   Step 5: After the loop, check:\n\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n  However, note: the second program in the chain uses the same variable `n` and then checks if it becomes 1. So we do the same.\n\n  But what if the input to the second program is 0? Then the loop runs infinitely and we never print. So we must not break out? \n\n  But the problem says: the chain runs the two programs. The first outputs 0, then the second program runs and never terminates. So our C program must also run forever? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify that the entire chain always terminates. We must be faithful.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if the input leads to an infinite loop, we must have an infinite loop.\n\n  However, in practice, we cannot have an infinite loop in a competition program? But the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n  Alternatively, we note that the first program's output is always at least 0? And 0 is the only nonpositive? And 0 leads to infinite loop? \n\n  But the problem states: the first program outputs 0 only if no non-outdated item is found. Is that possible? \n\n  Let me think: if there is no non-outdated item? Actually, if every item is outdated? Then the condition for updating ans1 is never met, so ans1 remains 0.\n\n  How about the guarantee? The problem does not say there is at least one non-outdated. So we must handle 0.\n\n  We have two options:\n      Option 1: Write the while loop as above and let it run infinitely for 0.\n      Option 2: But note: the original second program in Python would run infinitely for 0? Actually, in Python, the division by 2 for an integer 0 becomes float 0.0 and then modulus for float 0.0 is 0.0, so it continues. But in C, if we use integers, 0%2 is 0, and then 0/2 is 0 (integer division). So we get an infinite loop.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;   // ans1 is an integer (nonnegative)\n\n      while (n2 > 0 && n2 % 2 == 0) {   // This would break for n2=0? But the original doesn't break. So we cannot break.\n\n      We must not break: so we do:\n\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n\n      But for n2=0: 0%2 is 0, and then n2 becomes 0, and then again 0%2 is 0 -> infinite.\n\n  So we leave it as an infinite loop for 0? \n\n  However, the problem says: the chain runs the two programs. So if the first program outputs 0, the second program runs forever. Therefore, we must simulate that.\n\n  But note: in C, integer division by 2 for 0 is 0, so it's an infinite loop. So we are safe.\n\n  But wait: what if the first program outputs 0? Then the second part runs forever. However, the problem expects the entire chain to run forever? \n\n  But the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input leads to 0 output from the first program, then the chain runs forever. Therefore, our C program must run forever.\n\n  However, in a competition, we might get a TLE? But that is the behavior.\n\n  Alternatively, we note that the problem states that the first program prints the input_number. Then the second program runs. The problem does not specify that the chain always terminates.\n\n  So we write the while loop without a condition for 0.\n\n  But what about negative numbers? The first program outputs a nonnegative integer (index: 0 or positive). So we are safe.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Read n1.\n      Read n1 lines of four integers.\n      Compute the outdated array.\n      Find the non-outdated item with the smallest cost -> ans1 (1-based index, 0 if none).\n      Then set n2 = ans1.\n      Then do:\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;   // integer division\n          }\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n  However, if ans1 is 0, then the while loop runs forever and we never print. So we must not do anything after the while loop? \n\n  Actually, we do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n\n      if (n2 == 0) {\n          // We have to simulate the infinite loop? We can do while(1) { } but then we never print. \n          while (1) { \n              // do nothing, just loop forever.\n          }\n      } else {\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n      }\n\n  But note: the original program for the second part doesn't check for 0 separately. It just runs the while loop. And for 0, the while loop condition always holds and we never break. So we can simply do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 != 0 && n2 % 2 == 0) {   // This condition: if n2 is 0, then we break? But we don't want to break for 0. We want to run forever.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot break for 0. So we must not use the condition with n2 != 0.\n\n  The only safe way is to use:\n\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  And if the input is 0, then we get an infinite loop. That is the behavior.\n\n  But note: in C, integer division by 2 for 0 is 0, and then modulus 0%2 is 0, so it will loop infinitely.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the while loop as above and it will run infinitely for 0.\n\n  However, in a real system, we cannot let the program run infinitely? But the problem says to behave identically.\n\n  We assume that the input will not lead to 0? Or if it does, we must run infinitely.\n\n  But the problem does not specify. So we follow the specification.\n\n  Alternatively, we note: the first program sets minimum_cost to 100000 and then updates only if a non-outdated item is found. If no non-outdated item is found, then ans1 remains 0. So we must handle 0.\n\n  How about we output the same as the chain? The chain for 0 would hang. So our program must hang.\n\n  We write:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n      if (n2 == 1) {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\n  For n2=0: the while loop runs forever -> program hangs -> same as the chain.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain (Python) would run the while loop forever? Yes, because 0%2==0 is always true and 0/2 is 0. So it never breaks.\n\n  Therefore, we do not need to change the while loop.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: if the compiler optimizes the loop? It might notice that n2 is 0 and the loop condition is always true? But the behavior is undefined? Actually, the standard says that an infinite loop with no side effects is undefined behavior? \n\n  To avoid undefined behavior, we can do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n          // We can add a dummy side effect? But the problem says to behave identically.\n      }\n\n  Alternatively, we note that the problem does not require to run in a defined way by the C standard? We just require the same observable behavior.\n\n  But the observable behavior is that it runs forever. So we can leave it as:\n\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  And hope that the compiler does not optimize it? \n\n  But for n2=0, the expression n2%2 is 0, so we enter the loop, then n2 becomes 0/2=0, and then again condition is 0%2=0, so we loop.\n\n  This is an infinite loop and the standard says that if the loop condition is a constant expression, then the compiler can assume it terminates? Actually, no: the condition is not constant? Because n2 is being set to 0 in the first iteration and then remains 0? \n\n  We can try to use volatile? Or we can do:\n\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          // We cannot avoid the infinite loop for 0, so we just do the division.\n          n2 /= 2;\n          // But if n2 is 0, then we break? No, we must not break.\n      }\n\n  Actually, the standard says that if the program has an infinite loop with no observable behavior (like I/O or volatile accesses), then it is undefined. To make it defined, we can use a volatile variable? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      long long n2 = ans1;\n      while (1) {\n          if (n2 % 2 != 0) break;\n          if (n2 == 0) {\n              // We are going to loop forever? But we can't break. So we do nothing special?\n              // Actually, we do the division and then continue.\n          }\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  But that doesn't change the fact that for n2=0 we break the condition? \n\n  How about:\n\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          if (n2 == 0) {\n              // This will be true after the first division? But we don't want to break.\n              // We just do nothing and let it loop?\n          }\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  But that doesn't break the loop? It will still do the division and set to 0, then next iteration: 0%2==0 -> true, then we enter the if (n2==0) again? So it's an infinite loop? \n\n  Actually, the condition of the while loop is checked at every iteration. So for n2=0, we enter the loop body, then we check if n2==0 (which is true) and then we do nothing, then we set n2 = 0/2 -> 0. Then we check again: 0%2==0 -> true, and so on. So it's an infinite loop.\n\n  But that is the same as without the if.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid the undefined behavior by ensuring that the loop condition is not a constant expression? \n\n  Actually, the expression `n2 % 2 == 0` for n2=0 is always true? But the compiler might not know that n2 is 0? Because we set it from input. So it's not a constant.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the loop as above and it will run infinitely for 0.\n\n  Summary:\n\n      We read the initial n1 and the quadruples.\n      We compute the outdated array (with a double loop).\n      We find the non-outdated item with the smallest cost (and store its 1-based index in ans1).\n      Then we set n2 = ans1.\n      Then we run:\n\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n\n      Then we check if n2==1 -> print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n  But note: if n2 is 0, the program will run forever. \n\n  However, the problem states that the chain does this: the first program outputs 0 and the second program runs forever. So we are matching.\n\n  But what if n2 is negative? The first program outputs a nonnegative integer. So we are safe.\n\n  But note: the modulus for negative numbers: in C, the sign of the modulus result is implementation-defined? We need to avoid negative numbers.\n\n  Since the first program outputs an index (nonnegative), we are safe.\n\n  Let's test with a positive example:\n\n      Example: ans1 = 8.\n          n2=8: 8%2==0 -> true -> n2=8/2=4.\n          4%2==0 -> true -> n2=4/2=2.\n          2%2==0 -> true -> n2=2/2=1.\n          1%2 !=0 -> break.\n          then n2==1 -> print \"YES\".\n\n      Example: ans1=3.\n          n2=3: 3%2=1 -> break -> n2=3 !=1 -> print \"NO\".\n\n  But what if ans1=2? Then we get 2/2=1 -> break -> then n2=1 -> YES.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain: \n        n = 2 -> 2%2==0 -> n = 2/2 -> 1.0? But in our C program we are doing integer division so n2 becomes 1? Then we break and then check 1 -> YES.\n\n  So we are matching.\n\n  However, the original second program does:\n\n        n = int(input())   # so integer\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n / 2      # This is floating point? \n\n  But wait, in the original Python program, the division is floating point? Then for 8:\n\n        n=8 -> becomes 8.0, then 4.0, then 2.0, then 1.0 -> then condition 1.0 % 2 -> 1.0 % 2.0 is 1.0 -> break -> then check 1.0 == 1 -> True? \n\n  But note: in Python, 1.0==1 is True.\n\n  However, the modulus for floats: 8.0 % 2.0 is 0.0, which is 0, so condition holds.\n\n  But in C, we are doing integer modulus and division. The problem: if the number is very big, integer division and modulus might be faster? But the behavior is the same for positive integers? \n\n  However, what if the number is even but very big? The integer division in C will truncate, but that is the same as in the original? \n\n  Actually, the original does floating point? That might lose precision for very big integers? \n\n  Example: a big even number, say 2^60. In Python, when we do:\n\n        n = 2**60\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n / 2\n\n  This will do 60 iterations and then n becomes 1.0? \n\n  But in C, if we use `long long` (which is at least 64 bits), we can represent 2^60. Then:\n\n        n2 = 2^60 (as long long)\n        then we do integer division: 2^60 / 2 = 2^59 (exactly) and so on.\n\n  Then after 60 iterations, n2 becomes 1.\n\n  But if we use integer division, we avoid floating point inaccuracies? \n\n  However, the original uses floating point? So for very big integers, the floating point might not represent exactly? \n\n  But note: the original program uses `n = int(input())` so the input is an integer. Then the division by 2 is done in floating point? \n\n  Actually, the problem does not specify the range of the integer for the second program. The first program outputs an index between 0 and n, and n is at most the initial n (which is the number of items). The initial n is read as an integer. How big? The problem doesn't say.\n\n  But the first program: the input n is the first integer. Then we read n lines. So n is at most, say, 1000? 10000? \n\n  Therefore, the index (ans1) is at most 10000? \n\n  So we don't have to worry about big integers. The second program will get an integer at most 10000, which is small.\n\n  Therefore, we can safely use integer arithmetic in C.\n\n  Steps in code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n1;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n          // Define a struct for the item\n          typedef struct {\n              int s, r, h, c;\n          } Item;\n\n          Item* arr = (Item*)malloc(n1 * sizeof(Item));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &arr[i].s, &arr[i].r, &arr[i].h, &arr[i].c);\n          }\n\n          // Create an array to mark outdated (1 for outdated, 0 for not)\n          int* outdated = (int*)calloc(n1, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n\n          // Check for outdated items: for each i, if there exists j such that arr[j] is strictly superior in s, r, h, then mark i as outdated.\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < n1; j++) {\n                  if (i == j) continue;\n                  if (arr[j].s > arr[i].s && arr[j].r > arr[i].r && arr[j].h > arr[i].h) {\n                      outdated[i] = 1;\n                      break; // no need to check other j for this i\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          int min_cost = 100000; // as in the Python code\n          int ans1 = 0; // will be the 1-based index of the chosen item, 0 if none\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              if (outdated[i] == 0) {\n                  if (arr[i].c < min_cost) {\n                      min_cost = arr[i].c;\n                      ans1 = i+1;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now, free the memory we don't need anymore\n          free(arr);\n          free(outdated);\n\n          // Second part: use ans1 as the input to the second program\n          long long n2 = ans1;   // we use long long to be safe for division? but ans1 is at most 10000\n\n          // If we are concerned about the infinite loop for 0, we note that the problem says to behave identically.\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 = n2 / 2;\n          }\n\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then we get an infinite loop and the program never reaches the print. So we are good.\n\n  But note: the first program in the chain outputs 0, then the second program runs and gets stuck in the while loop. So the entire chain does not produce any output and runs forever. Our C program does the same.\n\n  Therefore, we are done.\n\n  But note: the Python program for the first part uses a set for outdated? We are using an array of booleans. The logic is the same.\n\n  Let me test with a small example:\n\n      n1 = 2\n      Item0: (1,1,1,10)\n      Item1: (2,2,2,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: check j=1: (2>1,2>1,2>1) -> true, so mark outdated[0]=1.\n      for i=1: check j=0: (1<2, ...) -> no, and j=1: skip? so outdated[1]=0.\n\n      Then we look for non-outdated: only index1 -> cost=5 -> ans1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n      Then second part: n2=2 -> even -> n2=1 -> then 1%2 !=0 -> break -> n2==1 -> print \"YES\".\n\n  That matches.\n\n  Another test: two items that are not comparable? \n      Item0: (1,2,3,10)\n      Item1: (2,1,2,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: compare to j=1: 2>1, 1<2 -> not all greater -> so not outdated by j=1.\n      for i=1: compare to j=0: 1<2, 2>1 -> not all greater -> so not outdated.\n\n      Then we have two non-outdated. We choose the one with minimum cost: min_cost=5 (item1) -> ans1=2.\n\n      Then second part: 2 -> becomes 1 -> YES.\n\n  Another test: no non-outdated? \n      n1=1: only one item: \n          Then for i=0: no j (because j from 0 to 0, but skip i=j) -> outdated[0]=0? \n          Then we choose it: ans1=1.\n\n      Then second part: 1 -> not even -> then n2=1 -> YES.\n\n  But wait: with one item, it should be non-outdated? \n\n  However, what if we have two items that are identical? \n      Item0: (1,1,1,10)\n      Item1: (1,1,1,5)\n\n      Then for i=0: compare to j=1: we require strictly greater? \n          (1>1, 1>1, 1>1) -> false -> so not outdated.\n      Similarly, for i=1: compare to j=0: false.\n\n      Then we have two non-outdated. We choose the one with min cost: item1 -> ans1=2.\n\n      Then second part: 2 -> becomes 1 -> YES.\n\n  But note: the condition in the first program is:\n        if (input_array[i][0] < input_array[j][0] and input_array[i][1] < input_array[j][1] and input_array[i][2] < input_array[j][2])\n\n      So if the two items are equal in all dimensions, then the condition fails. So they are not outdated.\n\n  Therefore, our C program matches.\n\n  Edge: n1=0? \n      The first program: \n          n = 0 -> input_array is empty.\n          Then the loop for outdated: no iterations -> outdated remains empty set.\n          Then the next loop: for i in range(0) -> no iterations -> ans1 remains 0.\n\n      Then second part: 0 -> infinite loop.\n\n  So our program must handle n1=0? \n\n      We read n1=0, then we try to allocate arr for 0 elements? That is safe. Then the loops run 0 times. Then we set ans1=0. Then the while loop runs infinitely.\n\n  Therefore, we are set.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      We include the necessary headers and write the code as above.\n\n  Note: We use long long for n2? Actually, the number is at most 10000, so int would be enough. But the division: we do integer division? and modulus? for int it's fine.\n\n  But to be safe for the modulus condition (if the number is big, but it's not), we can use int for n2 as well.\n\n  However, the first program outputs an integer that is at most n1 (which is an int). So we can use int for n2.\n\n  But the while loop condition: for a negative number? We avoid that. And for 0 we want infinite loop? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      int n2 = ans1;\n      while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n          n2 = n2 / 2;\n      }\n\n  But what if ans1 is negative? The first program outputs nonnegative, so we are safe.\n\n  However, let me check: the first program outputs 0 or a positive integer (i+1). So n2 is nonnegative.\n\n  Therefore, we can use int.\n\n  Code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          int n1;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n1);\n          typedef struct { int s, r, h, c; } Item;\n          Item *arr = (Item*)malloc(n1 * sizeof(Item));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &arr[i].s, &arr[i].r, &arr[i].h, &arr[i].c);\n          }\n\n          int *outdated = (int*)calloc(n1, sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < n1; j++) {\n                  if (i == j) continue;\n                  if (arr[j].s > arr[i].s && arr[j].r > arr[i].r && arr[j].h > arr[i].h) {\n                      outdated[i] = 1;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          int min_cost = 100000;\n          int ans1 = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {\n              if (!outdated[i]) {\n                  if (arr[i].c < min_cost) {\n                      min_cost = arr[i].c;\n                      ans1 = i+1;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          free(arr);\n          free(outdated);\n\n          int n2 = ans1;\n          while (n2 % 2 == 0) {\n              n2 /= 2;\n          }\n\n          if (n2 == 1) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the modulus and division for negative numbers: we avoid because n2 is nonnegative.\n\n  However, one more thing: the modulus operator in C for negative numbers is implementation-defined? But we avoid negative.\n\n  This should be the final program.\n\n  However, note: the original first program sets min_cost to 100000. What if the minimum cost is above 100000? Then we would not update. But the problem states that the cost is an integer? and we have at least one non-outdated? \n\n  But if the minimum cost is 100000 or above? Then we would not update? \n\n  Example: \n        min_cost = 100000\n        then we find a non-outdated item with cost=100000 -> condition cost < min_cost -> 100000 < 100000? false.\n        then we find a non-outdated item with cost=99999 -> update.\n\n  So if the smallest cost is 100000, we would not update? \n\n  The original program: \n        minimum_cost = 100000\n        ... \n        if ... and cost < minimum_cost: then update.\n\n  So if the smallest cost is 100000, then we never update? and ans1 remains 0.\n\n  Then the second program gets 0 and runs forever.\n\n  But that is the same as the original chain.\n\n  However, the problem says: we must behave identically.\n\n  But note: the original program sets min_cost to 100000, then if it finds an item with cost 100000, it does not update. But if there is an item with cost 100000 and it is non-outdated and that is the minimum? Then we should update? \n\n  We are comparing with `<` not `<=`.\n\n  How to fix? We should set min_cost to a very high value? But the problem says the first program sets to 100000.\n\n  Alternatively, we can set min_cost to a value higher than any possible cost? \n\n  The problem does not specify the range of cost. \n\n  Since the first program sets to 100000, we do the same.\n\n  But if the cost can be up to 10^6? Then we might not update if the minimum cost is 100000? \n\n  Actually, we want to update if we find a cost that is less than the current min_cost. We start at 100000. Then if the smallest cost is 100000, we never update? \n\n  How about we set min_cost to a value that is larger than any cost? \n\n  The original program does not. We must be faithful.\n\n  Therefore, we leave min_cost=100000.\n\n  But note: the problem says the first program is:\n\n        minimum_cost = 100000\n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  However, if the minimum cost among non-outdated items is 100000, then we output 0? which then causes the second program to run forever? \n\n  But that is the behavior.\n\n  Alternatively, we can set min_cost to the first non-outdated item? But the original program does not do that.\n\n  We are not allowed to change the logic.\n\n  Therefore, we keep as above.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimum_cost = 100000\" and then we update only if we find a cost that is strictly less.\n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      We output the C program as above.\n\n  However, we must note: the first program might output 0 even if there are non-outdated items if the cost of every non-outdated item is >=100000? \n\n  But the problem states: the cost is an integer. And 100000 is a constant.\n\n  We assume the problem expects that the cost might be high? \n\n  But the problem does not specify the range. So we are safe.\n\n  We write the code accordingly.\n\n  Let me run through an example: \n        n1=1, item: (0,0,0,100000)\n        Then the item is non-outdated? (because no other item) -> then we check: cost=100000 < 100000? false -> ans1=0.\n        Then second part: infinite loop.\n\n  That matches the original: the first program would output 0.\n\n  Therefore, we are done."
