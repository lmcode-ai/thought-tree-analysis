They are integers. But if the integers are negative, we get a minus sign. The minus sign is not a letter. However, what if the integers are in exponential form? We are using %d -> decimal. So the string will only contain digits, spaces, and possibly minus signs. Therefore, we are safe. However, what if the integer is so big that the representation has an 'E'? No, %d does not use exponential form. Therefore, the above code is sufficient. Let me run the example: \"0 0 0 1\" -> outputs \"No\" as expected. But what if the input is: \"65 66 67 68\" (which are ASCII for 'A','B','C','D')? Then the intermediate string would be: \n            x3 = 67 - (68-66) = 67 - 2 = 65 -> 'A' in ASCII is 65, but we are printing 65 as an integer -> the string will be \"65 ...\", which is two characters: '6' and '5'. So no 'A' (which is 65 as an integer, but the character 'A' is not the same as the string \"65\"). Therefore, still safe. So we are done.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Python programs into a single C program.\n The first program reads four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) and computes two points (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) for a parallelogram.\n Then it prints: x3, y3, x4, y4 as space separated.\n\n The second program reads a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. It prints \"Yes\" if both are present, else \"No\".\n\n However, note that the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program? \n But wait: the first program outputs four numbers (like \"1 2 3 4\") and the second program expects a string that may contain 'A' and 'B'. \n This does not make sense because the first program outputs digits and spaces, which are unlikely to contain 'A' or 'B'. \n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the output of the first program (a string of four integers separated by spaces) is the input to the second program.\n\n The second program then checks if that string contains the letters 'A' and 'B'. Since the string is composed of digits and spaces, \n it will never contain 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the second program will always output \"No\".\n\n However, that seems to be the intended chain. We must follow the instructions.\n\n Steps for the C program:\n 1. Read the first line of input (which is four integers separated by spaces) for the first program.\n 2. Process the first program: compute (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).\n 3. Format the output of the first program as a string: four integers in the order x3, y3, x4, y4, each separated by a space.\n    This string becomes the input for the second program.\n 4. In the second program, we check if this string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it is built from digits and spaces, it won't, so we output \"No\".\n\n However, note: the second program in the original code reads from stdin. But in the chain, the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n Therefore, the entire C program should:\n   - Read the initial four integers (we can use scanf).\n   - Compute the four new integers (x3, y3, x4, y4).\n   - Format these four integers into a string (without printing it to the actual output, but we need to use it as the input for the next step).\n   - Then, on that string, check for presence of 'A' and 'B'.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output\".\n\n Therefore, we do not print the intermediate string. Instead, we simulate the chain without actual I/O for the intermediate step.\n\n How to do:\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n   Step 2: Compute x3, y3, x4, y4.\n   Step 3: Instead of printing, we form a string that would be the output of the first program (which is the input of the second). \n            But note: the second program expects a string. We must form exactly the same string as the first program would print.\n\n   However, the second program is: \n        stdin = input()\n        s = stdin\n        result = \"Yes\" if \"A\" in s and \"B\" in s else \"No\"\n\n   So we need to create a string that is the representation of the four numbers (with spaces) and then check that string for containing 'A' and 'B'.\n\n   Important: the first program prints: \n        print(str(x3) + \" \" + str(y3) + \" \" + str(x4) + \" \" + str(y4))\n\n   We must form the same string in memory.\n\n   But note: the second program reads a whole line? The original first program prints without a trailing newline? Actually, the print in Python adds a newline by default? \n   However, the second program uses input() which reads a whole line including the newline? \n\n   But wait: in the first program, the output is a string without a newline? Actually, the print function in Python adds a newline. \n   So the first program outputs: \"x3 y3 x4 y4\\n\"\n\n   The second program's input() will read that entire line including the newline? Actually, the input() function in Python strips the trailing newline? \n   According to the documentation, input() reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline). \n\n   So the string `s` in the second program is without the trailing newline? \n\n   However, in the chain, the output of the first program is the input to the second. The second program reads that entire output as one string.\n\n   Therefore, in C, we must form a string that is the four numbers in the same format and without a newline? \n   Actually, the first program in the chain does output a newline. But the second program's input() strips it? \n\n   Let me test with two small Python programs:\n\n   Program1.py:\n        print(\"1 2 3 4\")\n\n   Program2.py:\n        s = input()\n        print(s)\n\n   When run as:\n        python Program1.py | python Program2.py\n\n   The second program prints: \"1 2 3 4\" (without the newline? Actually, the second program's input reads the entire line including the newline? and then strips it? \n   Then the second program prints and adds a newline? So the output becomes \"1 2 3 4\\n\" again.\n\n   But the second program in our case does not print the string, it only checks for 'A' and 'B'. \n\n   So we have to form a string that is exactly what the first program outputs? That is: the four numbers and a space and then a newline? \n   Actually, the second program's input() removes the trailing newline? \n\n   Therefore, the string that the second program sees is without the trailing newline. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify whether the input to the second program includes the newline. But note: the second program uses `input()` which strips the newline.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n        Step 2: Compute DIF1 = x2 - x1, DIF2 = y2 - y1.\n                Then: \n                    x3 = x2 - DIF2\n                    y3 = y2 + DIF1\n                    x4 = x1 - DIF2\n                    y4 = y1 + DIF1\n\n        Step 3: Format these four integers (x3, y3, x4, y4) into a string without a newline? \n                But note: the first program outputs with a newline. However, the second program's input() will remove it. \n                So the string we need to check is the string without the newline? \n\n        Actually, the chain: \n            The first program writes: \"x3 y3 x4 y4\\n\" to stdout.\n            The second program reads from stdin and gets the entire line including the newline? and then input() strips the newline? \n\n        Therefore, the string that the second program sees is the four numbers separated by spaces without the trailing newline.\n\n        But what if we have multiple lines? The first program only outputs one line.\n\n        So we can form a string: \n            char intermediate[100]; // big enough\n            sprintf(intermediate, \"%d %d %d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\n        Then we check this string for containing 'A' and 'B'. \n\n        However, note: the first program's output is one line. The second program only reads one line.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to worry about the newline because the second program's input() removes it? \n        But in our simulation, we are not actually writing to stdout and reading back. We are just forming the string that the second program would have read (without the newline). \n\n        Since the second program does: \n            s = stdin   # which is the entire line without the newline.\n\n        We can use the string we formed (without adding a newline) to represent `s`.\n\n        Then we check: if this string contains 'A' AND 'B', then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        But note: the string we formed is of digits and spaces. It will never contain 'A' or 'B'. So we can short-circuit? \n        However, we must write the code as if the string could be arbitrary? Actually, the input to the first program is integers, so the intermediate string is digits and spaces.\n\n        But to be safe, we'll write the check.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read x1, y1, x2, y2 with scanf.\n   Step 2: Compute the four integers: x3, y3, x4, y4.\n   Step 3: Format these four integers into a string (without newline) in a buffer.\n   Step 4: Check the buffer for containing both 'A' and 'B'. \n            We traverse the string and check for presence of 'A' and presence of 'B'.\n\n   Step 5: Print either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we only output the result of the second program.\n\n However, what about the first program? It is supposed to output the four numbers? But in the chain, that output is consumed by the second program. \n The final output of the entire chain is the output of the second program.\n\n Therefore, the entire C program should output only \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But wait: the original chain would output:\n        First program: \"x3 y3 x4 y4\\n\"\n        Second program: \"Yes\\n\" or \"No\\n\"\n\n        So the overall output is: \"x3 y3 x4 y4\\nYes\\n\" ? \n\n        Actually, when chained, the first program's output becomes the second program's input, and the second program's output is the final output.\n\n        Therefore, the final output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\n        So the C program should only output \"Yes\" or \"No\", and then a newline? \n\n        But note: the second program does: print(result) -> which adds a newline.\n\n        So we output either \"Yes\\n\" or \"No\\n\".\n\n However, let me clarify: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is that the final output is the output of the last program.\n\n Therefore, the C program should only output one line: either \"Yes\" or \"No\", with a newline.\n\n But note: the intermediate step (the output of the first program) is never seen by the user? It is internal to the chain.\n\n Therefore, the C program should:\n\n   Read four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2.\n   Compute x3, y3, x4, y4.\n   Format a string (without newline) of the four integers: x3, y3, x4, y4 (space separated).\n   Check that string for containing 'A' and 'B'. \n   Then output \"Yes\" or \"No\" (with a newline).\n\n However, there is a catch: what if the intermediate string is very long? We are using a fixed buffer. But the integers are not huge.\n\n We can assume the integers are within the range of int, and the string representation of each integer is at most 11 characters (for 32-bit int) plus 3 spaces and a null terminator -> 4*11+3+1 = 48. So 100 is safe.\n\n Code:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n        int DIF1 = x2 - x1;\n        int DIF2 = y2 - y1;\n        int x3 = x2 - DIF2;\n        int y3 = y2 + DIF1;\n        int x4 = x1 - DIF2;\n        int y4 = y1 + DIF1;\n\n        // Format the intermediate string: without newline, exactly as the first program's output (without the newline because the second program's input() strips it)\n        char s[100];\n        sprintf(s, \"%d %d %d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\n        // Now check the string `s` for containing 'A' and 'B'\n        int foundA = 0;\n        int foundB = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n            if (s[i] == 'A') {\n                foundA = 1;\n            }\n            if (s[i] == 'B') {\n                foundB = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (foundA && foundB) {\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\n But note: the intermediate string does not have a newline? And we are not including one. \n        The first program would have printed with a newline, but the second program's input() removes it. \n        So the string that the second program sees is without the trailing newline. \n        Therefore, we are correct to format without the newline.\n\n However, what if the first program output had a space at the end? Our sprintf does not add any extra space or newline.\n\n Let me check: the format is \"%d %d %d %d\", so it's four integers separated by single spaces, and no extra space at the end.\n\n This matches the Python: \n        print(str(x3) + \" \" + str(y3) + \" \" + str(x4) + \" \" + str(y4))\n\n So we are safe.\n\n But note: what if the integers are negative? The representation would include a minus sign. But that is still a digit and a minus, and no letters. \n        However, the minus sign is not a letter. So the check for 'A' and 'B' will still fail.\n\n Therefore, the program will always output \"No\", but that is the behavior of the chain.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n We are simulating the chain.\n\n Example test:\n\n   Input: \"0 0 0 1\"\n\n   First program:\n        x1=0, y1=0, x2=0, y2=1\n        DIF1 = 0, DIF2 = 1\n        x3 = 0 - 1 = -1\n        y3 = 1 + 0 = 1\n        x4 = 0 - 1 = -1\n        y4 = 0 + 0 = 0\n        Output: \"-1 1 -1 0\"\n\n   Second program: \n        s = \"-1 1 -1 0\" (without newline)\n        Check: does it contain 'A'? -> no. 'B'? -> no. -> output \"No\"\n\n   So the C program should output \"No\".\n\n   How does our C program do?\n        Reads: 0 0 0 1\n        Computes: same -> x3=-1, y3=1, x4=-1, y4=0\n        Formats s = \"-1 1 -1 0\"\n        Checks: no 'A' or 'B' -> prints \"No\"\n\n   Therefore, correct.\n\n However, note: the second program in the original code is:\n\n        stdin = input()\n        s = stdin\n        result = \"Yes\" if \"A\" in s and \"B\" in s else \"No\"\n\n        This checks if the string contains the character 'A' and the character 'B'. \n\n        But what if the string has 'a' or 'b'? The check is case-sensitive. \n\n        Our C program does case-sensitive check.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n Important: We must read exactly four integers. The problem says the first program does: p = input().split(\" \"), then takes the first four.\n\n   Our scanf reads four integers. It will skip any whitespace. \n\n   But note: the input might have extra spaces? The split in Python would give non-empty tokens? \n\n   Example: \"  0  0   0  1  \" -> split by space -> the list might have empty strings at the beginning or end? \n        Actually, split without argument in Python splits by any whitespace and removes leading/trailing empty strings? \n        But here: split(\" \") -> splits by single space. So:\n\n        \" 0 0 0 1\".split(\" \") -> ['', '0', '0', '0', '1']? \n        Then the first four tokens? But the program does: p[0] to p[3]. \n\n        This would fail if there is a leading space because p[0] is empty string -> int(\"\") -> error.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the input format beyond that it is four integers. We assume the input is four integers separated by spaces, without extra leading or trailing spaces? \n\n   But the problem says: the first program uses input().split(\" \") and then takes the first four. \n\n   We must mimic: the Python program would crash if there are less than four tokens? \n\n   In C, if we have less than four integers, scanf will wait for more? or leave the rest uninitialized? \n\n   We assume the input has at least four integers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read a whole line and then parse? But the problem says the first block handles reading input. \n\n   We'll use:\n\n        char line[1000];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n        // Then split by space and take the first four tokens? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and the original reads from stdin. \n\n   However, the original first program reads a line and splits by space. We can do:\n\n        We read a line and then extract the first four integers.\n\n   But note: the problem says we are to read the same input. The original chain: the first program reads one line. \n\n   We can read one line with fgets and then parse the integers.\n\n   How to parse: we can use sscanf on the line? \n\n        sscanf(line, \"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n   This will read the first four integers in the line, skipping any whitespace. \n\n   But the Python split(\" \") does not skip multiple spaces? It creates tokens for consecutive spaces? \n\n        Example: \"1  2\" (two spaces) -> split(\" \") gives ['1', '', '2'] -> then int('') fails.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the input. But the problem says: the input is meant for the first program.\n\n   The first program expects four integers. The input must be four integers separated by single spaces? \n\n   But the problem does not say. \n\n   We must be robust? The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n   The same behavior: the first program would crash if the input does not have at least four non-empty tokens? \n\n   We are not required to handle errors? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify, we assume the input has exactly four integers separated by any whitespace? \n\n   Actually, the Python program would break if there are consecutive spaces? \n\n   Therefore, we must mimic the Python behavior? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"the same input\". \n\n   We'll assume the input is well-formed: one line with four integers separated by one or more spaces? \n\n   But the original program uses split(\" \") and then takes the first four tokens. If there are consecutive spaces, then the tokens in between are empty strings. \n\n        Example: \"1  2 3 4\" -> tokens: ['1', '', '2', '3', '4'] -> then p[0]='1', p[1]='', p[2]='2', p[3]='3' -> then y1 = int('') -> crash.\n\n   Therefore, the input must not have consecutive spaces? Or the input must have non-empty tokens? \n\n   The problem does not specify. \n\n   We are going to assume the input is as expected: four integers separated by single spaces? \n\n   Alternatively, we can read four integers with scanf and it will skip any whitespace. \n\n   So if the input is \"1  2 3 4\", scanf will read the four integers without problem. \n\n   But the Python program would crash. \n\n   Therefore, we are not mimicking the crash? \n\n   The problem says: \"behaves identically\". \n\n   We have two options:\n\n      Option 1: Read the entire line and split by space and take the first four non-empty tokens? \n\n      Option 2: Use the fact that the problem says the input is four integers and use scanf to read four integers.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the exact formatting beyond that it is four integers, and the example uses a single space, we use scanf.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the same input\". If the input has consecutive spaces, the Python program crashes. Our C program would not. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify error handling. We assume the input is well-formed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read a line and then parse with strtok to mimic the split? \n\n   But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and we are to write a single C program. \n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says the input is four integers, we'll read four integers with scanf.\n\n   If the input is malformed, the behavior is undefined.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        if (scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2) != 4) {\n            // But the problem does not specify error handling. We assume 4 integers.\n            // We can output an error? But the original Python program would crash. \n            // We'll output nothing and let it be? Or we output \"No\" because the second program would run on the output of the first? \n            // However, if the first program crashes, the second program would not get any input? Then the second program would get EOF? \n            // Then the second program: \n            //      stdin = input() -> EOF -> raises EOFError -> crash.\n\n            // Therefore, we are not required to handle errors? \n\n            // We'll just read the four integers and assume they are there.\n            // If not, we return an error? \n\n            // The problem does not specify, so we assume the input is valid.\n\n        }\n\n   We'll assume the input has four integers.\n\n   Therefore, we use:\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n   This matches the expected input.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n            scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n            int DIF1 = x2 - x1;\n            int DIF2 = y2 - y1;\n            int x3 = x2 - DIF2;\n            int y3 = y2 + DIF1;\n            int x4 = x1 - DIF2;\n            int y4 = y1 + DIF1;\n\n            char s[100];\n            sprintf(s, \"%d %d %d %d\", x3, y3, x4, y4);\n\n            int foundA = 0, foundB = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {\n                if (s[i] == 'A') foundA = 1;\n                if (s[i] == 'B') foundB = 1;\n            }\n\n            if (foundA && foundB) {\n                printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n But note: what if the intermediate string is exactly \"A B 1 2\"? \n        Actually, the integers are computed from the input integers. They are integers. But if the integers are negative, we get a minus sign. \n        The minus sign is not a letter. \n\n        However, what if the integers are in exponential form? We are using %d -> decimal. \n\n        So the string will only contain digits, spaces, and possibly minus signs. \n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n However, what if the integer is so big that the representation has an 'E'? No, %d does not use exponential form.\n\n Therefore, the above code is sufficient.\n\n Let me run the example: \"0 0 0 1\" -> outputs \"No\" as expected.\n\n But what if the input is: \"65 66 67 68\" (which are ASCII for 'A','B','C','D')? \n        Then the intermediate string would be: \n            x3 = 67 - (68-66) = 67 - 2 = 65 -> 'A' in ASCII is 65, but we are printing 65 as an integer -> the string will be \"65 ...\", which is two characters: '6' and '5'. \n\n        So no 'A' (which is 65 as an integer, but the character 'A' is not the same as the string \"65\").\n\n        Therefore, still safe.\n\n So we are done."
