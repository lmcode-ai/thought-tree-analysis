The states:\n      pmin: minimal coins so far without having a carry (i.e., we are exactly at the current digit, and we haven't borrowed)\n      mmin: minimal coins so far if we have a carry (borrowed one from the next higher digit) -> meaning we have an extra 10 that we have to account for?\n\n  Actually, the state transition:\n\n      Without a carry (pmin) at the current digit:\n          Option 1: pay exactly v: then we use v coins of 1 (and then we don't carry) -> cost v.\n          Option 2: overpay: we pay 10 - (v) coins to get change? Actually, the program does:\n\n          npmin = min( \n              pmin + (10 - (v+1)),   // meaning: if we had no carry and we decide to pay with a 10-coin and then get change? But note: we subtract 1? Actually, this might be for the case of having a carry from the next digit? This is a standard problem: see https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc180/tasks/abc180_e?lang=en (but not exactly) or a typical coin change with two coins: 1 and 10, but allowing change. However, we don't need to understand the problem, we just need to translate the DP. Steps:\n\n      Let s0 = \"0\" + the_string_of_res1. Then we traverse the string from the last character to the first (i.e., from least significant to most) and update:\n\n          pmin_old = pmin\n          mmin_old = mmin\n\n          v = current_digit - '0'\n\n          npmin = min( pmin_old + 10 - (v+1), mmin_old + 10 - v )\n          nmmin = min( pmin_old + v+1, mmin_old + v )\n\n          Then set pmin = npmin, mmin = nmmin. Then the result is min(pmin, mmin). But note: the second program's initial state:\n\n          pmin = 1000\n          mmin = 0\n\n      Why?",

                                                                            "text": "We can store the sequence in an array of length N (which we pass by value? but recursion depth is 10, so we can pass an array of fixed size? but 10 is small). Alternatively, we can use a global array and use recursion with backtracking. Let's do:\n\n              int A[10];   // the current sequence, of length len (from 0 to len-1)\n              void rec(int len) {\n                  if (len == N) {\n                      // compute the score\n                      int ans = 0;\n                      for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n                          if (A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]) {\n                              ans += d[i];\n                          }\n                      }\n                      if (ans > res) res = ans;\n                      return;\n                  }\n                  int last_max = (len==0) ? 1 : A[len-1];\n                  for (int i=last_max; i<=M; i++) {\n                      A[len] = i;\n                      rec(len+1);\n                  }\n              }\n\n          Then we call rec(0). Step 3: After the recursion, we have the integer `res` (the maximum score). Step 4: Convert `res` to a string. But note: if res is 0, we need to form the string \"0\". We'll use:\n\n          char s1[20];   // for the integer\n          sprintf(s1, \"%d\", res);\n          Then form a new string: s2 = \"0\" + s1 -> we can do:\n\n          char s2[21];\n          s2[0] = '0';\n          strcpy(s2+1, s1);   // now s2 is \"0\" followed by the string of res. Step 5: Now, we run the DP for the second program on s2. We note: the DP processes the string from the last character to the first? Actually, the original code does:\n\n            for c in s[::-1]:\n                v = int(c) So we traverse the string s2 from the last character to the first. But note: the string s2 is in the order: first character is the leading zero, then the digits of res. Example: res=36 -> s2 = \"036\"\n\n          We traverse from the last character to the first: \n              index0: '6' -> v=6\n              index1: '3'\n              index2: '0'\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            int len_s2 = strlen(s2);\n            int pmin = 1000;\n            int mmin = 0;\n\n            for (int i = len_s2-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                int v = s2[i] - '0';   // but wait: the original string s2 is \"036\", then when we traverse from the end, we get:\n                    i=2: v = s2[2] = '6' -> v=6\n                    i=1: v = s2[1] = '3' -> v=3\n                    i=0: v = s2[0] = '0' -> v=0\n\n                But the original code in the second program did:\n\n                    s = '0' + s   -> \"036\"\n                    then reversed: becomes ['6','3','0'] and then iterates in that order. So in our DP, we are iterating in the order: last character to first, which is the same as the reversed string?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Python programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (File 1) reads input, processes it, and prints an integer. The second program (File 2) reads a string (from stdin) and prints an integer. However, note that the second program has multiple input methods and platform handling, but the core logic is in the function `main` (and also `main_b` but it's not used in the non-test part).\n\nBut note: the second program's `main` function returns the value and then if it's not None, it prints it. However, in the first program, we already printed the result. So how do we chain?\n\nActually, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs an integer (via `print(res)`). The second program expects a string (from `input()`). So we must consider that the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\nHowever, the second program does:\n  s = input()\n  ... and then processes the string of digits.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs a single integer. The second program then reads a string of digits (which is the integer from the first program) and then computes the answer.\n\nBut the second program also has an alternative input method for iOS. We are to write a single C program that does the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n\n1. We will read the input that the first program reads (N, M, Q, and then Q quadruples) and also the input that the second program would read? Wait, no: the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program. The second program takes the output of the first.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain would get its input from the output of the first. So we must simulate:\n\n  Step 1: Run the first program's logic on the initial input (which is the same as the first program reads) to compute an integer `res1`.\n  Step 2: Then, use `res1` as the input string to the second program? But note: the second program expects a string of digits. So we convert `res1` to a string? However, the second program then processes each digit.\n\nBut wait: the second program in the example is actually reading a string that is a number? Actually, the example input for the second program is a string of digits (like \"36\") and then it does:\n\n    s = input()\n    ... and then processes it.\n\nHowever, note: the second program has two implementations: `main_b` and `main`. The one that is called is `main` (because `main_b` is defined but not called). The `main` function in the second program does:\n\n    s = '0' + s   [after reversing the string? no, note: it reverses the string in the for loop: `for c in s[::-1]`? Actually, no: the `s` is reversed in the loop: `for c in s[::-1]` but then the function `main` does:\n\n        s = '0' + s   # then reverses the entire string? Actually, the code:\n\n            s = '0' + s\n            for c in s[::-1]:\n\n        This is equivalent to processing the string from least significant digit to most.\n\nBut note: the input to the second program is the integer result from the first. We must convert that integer to a string without any extra spaces. For example, if the first program outputs 36, then the second program would read the string \"36\".\n\nHowever, the second program's `main` function then does:\n\n    s = '0' + s   -> becomes \"036\"\n\n    Then it reverses: so it becomes ['6','3','0'] and processes in that order.\n\nBut note: the second program actually uses dynamic programming to compute the minimal number of coins (it's a typical digit DP problem for minimizing the number of coins when paying with coins of 1 and 10^k?).\n\nSo we have to:\n\n  1. Run the first program to get an integer result (let's call it `res1`).\n  2. Convert `res1` to a string (without any extra spaces, just the decimal representation).\n  3. Then run the second program's `main` function on that string to compute the result.\n\nBut note: the second program has two functions: `main_b` and `main`. The one that is called is `main` (because the code does `ret = main()`). We must use the `main` function from the second program, not `main_b`.\n\nHowever, the second program also has platform-specific code for iOS and input methods. We are to ignore that because we are simulating without intermediate I/O. We are going to use the core logic.\n\nTherefore, we break down:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N, M, Q, and then Q quadruples).\n  Step 2: Run the recursive algorithm from the first program to compute `res1`.\n  Step 3: Convert `res1` to a string (we'll use `sprintf` or similar to get a string representation).\n  Step 4: Then, run the dynamic programming from the second program on the string (which we will have to reverse appropriately? Actually, the second program already reverses the string: it does `for c in s[::-1]`). But note: the second program also prepends a '0'. So we do:\n\n        char s[20]; // enough for an integer\n        sprintf(s, \"%d\", res1);\n        Then we form a new string: \"0\" + s -> then reverse the entire string? Actually, in the second program, the string is processed from the least significant digit to the most. We can simulate by processing the string from the end to the beginning? But the DP in the second program is designed to work from the least significant digit.\n\n  Alternatively, we can simulate the DP without actually reversing the string: we can traverse the string backwards.\n\nBut note: the second program's DP:\n\n        pmin = 1000   # the minimal cost if we have no carry from the next digit (or we have paid without needing to carry) -> actually, the state is the minimal coins so far without having a carry (pmin) and with having a carry (mmin) at the current digit?\n        mmin = 0       # actually, the state for having a carry?\n\n        Then for each digit in the reversed string (which is the original string in reverse order) it does:\n\n          v = int(c)\n          npmin = min(pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v)\n          nmmin = min(pmin + v+1, mmin + v)\n          pmin = npmin\n          mmin = nmmin\n\n        Then the answer is min(pmin, mmin)\n\n  How do we interpret?\n\n  Actually, the problem the second program is solving: \n      We have a number represented as a string of digits (without leading zeros, but we added a leading zero). We can pay this amount by using coins of 1 and 10^k. However, we can also overpay and get change. The goal is to minimize the total number of coins.\n\n  The states:\n      pmin: minimal coins so far without having a carry (i.e., we are exactly at the current digit, and we haven't borrowed)\n      mmin: minimal coins so far if we have a carry (borrowed one from the next higher digit) -> meaning we have an extra 10 that we have to account for?\n\n  Actually, the state transition:\n\n      Without a carry (pmin) at the current digit:\n          Option 1: pay exactly v: then we use v coins of 1 (and then we don't carry) -> cost v.\n          Option 2: overpay: we pay 10 - (v) coins to get change? Actually, the program does:\n\n          npmin = min( \n              pmin + (10 - (v+1)),   // meaning: if we had no carry and we decide to pay with a 10-coin and then get change? But note: we subtract 1? Actually, this might be for the case of having a carry from the next digit? \n\n          This is a standard problem: see https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc180/tasks/abc180_e?lang=en (but not exactly) or a typical coin change with two coins: 1 and 10, but allowing change.\n\n  However, we don't need to understand the problem, we just need to translate the DP.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let s0 = \"0\" + the_string_of_res1.\n\n      Then we traverse the string from the last character to the first (i.e., from least significant to most) and update:\n\n          pmin_old = pmin\n          mmin_old = mmin\n\n          v = current_digit - '0'\n\n          npmin = min( pmin_old + 10 - (v+1), mmin_old + 10 - v )\n          nmmin = min( pmin_old + v+1, mmin_old + v )\n\n          Then set pmin = npmin, mmin = nmmin.\n\n      Then the result is min(pmin, mmin).\n\n  But note: the second program's initial state:\n\n          pmin = 1000\n          mmin = 0\n\n      Why? Because at the beginning (the most significant digit, which we are processing last) we don't have a carry? Actually, we added a leading zero so that the most significant digit is zero.\n\n      However, the initial state is set before the loop. Then we iterate over the reversed string (which is the original string with the leading zero, then reversed). The reversed string has the least significant digit first.\n\n  Example: if the string is \"036\", then reversed is \"630\". Then the digits processed are '6','3','0'. \n\n  But note: the leading zero we added is at the beginning of the original string, so when reversed, it becomes the last. So we are processing:\n\n      digit0: '6' -> v=6\n      digit1: '3' -> v=3\n      digit2: '0' -> v=0\n\n  However, the original number is 36. The string was \"36\", then we prepend '0' -> \"036\", then reversed -> \"630\". Then we process:\n\n      first: 6 -> then 3 -> then 0.\n\n  But the DP state after processing the entire string (including the leading zero) should be the answer.\n\n  Now, we have to combine:\n\n      We read the input for the first program, compute res1 (an integer).\n      Convert res1 to a string, then form a new string = \"0\" + that string? Actually, the second program does:\n\n          s = input()\n          s = '0' + s\n\n      So we must do that.\n\n  However, note: the first program outputs the integer without any formatting (just the number). So if the integer is 0, we output \"0\", then the second program reads \"0\", then becomes \"00\", then reversed is \"00\", then processed: two zeros.\n\n  But note: the second program might be designed for positive integers? The first program's output is nonnegative (since it's a maximum of nonnegative d[i]).\n\n  Steps for the C program:\n\n      Step 1: Read N, M, Q, then Q quadruples (a, b, c, d for each query).\n      Step 2: Simulate the recursive function of the first program (which is a DFS generating non-decreasing sequences of length N with values from 1 to M). We'll have to convert the recursion to iterative or use recursion in C (but N is at most 10, so recursion depth 10 is safe).\n      Step 3: Compute the integer result (res1) of the first program.\n      Step 4: Convert res1 to a string and form a new string: \"0\" + res1_str. But note: the second program expects the input to be the integer as a string. So if res1 is 123, then we form \"0123\".\n      Step 5: Then run the DP of the second program on this new string (processing each character from last to first, i.e., from the end of the string to the beginning? because the original code did s[::-1] which is the reverse order of the string). Actually, the reverse of the string \"0123\" is \"3210\". But we don't have to form the reversed string; we can traverse the original string from the last character to the first.\n\n          Alternatively, we can form the reversed string? But the DP doesn't require the entire string at once, we can traverse backwards.\n\n      Step 6: Print the result of the DP (which is the minimal coins).\n\n  However, note: the first program already printed the result? But we are chaining. The entire chain should only print the final result? \n\n  The problem says: \n      Only the first block should handle reading input.\n      Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n  So we must not print the intermediate result (res1). We only print the final result of the second program.\n\n  Therefore, the C program:\n\n      - Reads the input for the first program.\n      - Computes the intermediate integer (res1) without printing it.\n      - Then uses that integer to form a string (with a leading zero) and runs the DP.\n      - Then prints the result of the DP.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n      Step 1: Read N, M, Q, and then Q quadruples.\n\n      Step 2: We have to do a DFS (recursion) for generating sequences. We'll use a recursive function in C.\n\n          Global variables for the first part:\n              int N, M, Q;\n              int a[Q], b[Q], c[Q], d[Q];\n              int res = 0;   // the maximum sum we are going to compute\n\n          We'll have a recursive function that takes:\n              int *A, int len   (or we can pass the last element and the length and the next value to append? Actually, the Python code uses a list and appends)\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire sequence? We only use the last element and the length.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              void rec(int last, int len, ...) \n\n          But we need the entire sequence to compute the condition: for each query i, we check A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]. So we need the entire sequence.\n\n          We can store the sequence in an array of length N (which we pass by value? but recursion depth is 10, so we can pass an array of fixed size? but 10 is small).\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a global array and use recursion with backtracking.\n\n          Let's do:\n\n              int A[10];   // the current sequence, of length len (from 0 to len-1)\n              void rec(int len) {\n                  if (len == N) {\n                      // compute the score\n                      int ans = 0;\n                      for (int i=0; i<Q; i++) {\n                          if (A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]) {\n                              ans += d[i];\n                          }\n                      }\n                      if (ans > res) res = ans;\n                      return;\n                  }\n                  int last_max = (len==0) ? 1 : A[len-1];\n                  for (int i=last_max; i<=M; i++) {\n                      A[len] = i;\n                      rec(len+1);\n                  }\n              }\n\n          Then we call rec(0).\n\n      Step 3: After the recursion, we have the integer `res` (the maximum score).\n\n      Step 4: Convert `res` to a string. But note: if res is 0, we need to form the string \"0\". We'll use:\n\n          char s1[20];   // for the integer\n          sprintf(s1, \"%d\", res);\n          Then form a new string: s2 = \"0\" + s1 -> we can do:\n\n          char s2[21];\n          s2[0] = '0';\n          strcpy(s2+1, s1);   // now s2 is \"0\" followed by the string of res.\n\n      Step 5: Now, we run the DP for the second program on s2.\n\n          We note: the DP processes the string from the last character to the first? Actually, the original code does:\n\n            for c in s[::-1]:\n                v = int(c)\n\n          So we traverse the string s2 from the last character to the first.\n\n          But note: the string s2 is in the order: first character is the leading zero, then the digits of res.\n\n          Example: res=36 -> s2 = \"036\"\n\n          We traverse from the last character to the first: \n              index0: '6' -> v=6\n              index1: '3'\n              index2: '0'\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            int len_s2 = strlen(s2);\n            int pmin = 1000;\n            int mmin = 0;\n\n            for (int i = len_s2-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                int v = s2[i] - '0';   // but wait: the original string s2 is \"036\", then when we traverse from the end, we get:\n                    i=2: v = s2[2] = '6' -> v=6\n                    i=1: v = s2[1] = '3' -> v=3\n                    i=0: v = s2[0] = '0' -> v=0\n\n                But the original code in the second program did:\n\n                    s = '0' + s   -> \"036\"\n                    then reversed: becomes ['6','3','0'] and then iterates in that order.\n\n                So in our DP, we are iterating in the order: last character to first, which is the same as the reversed string? Actually, the reversed string of \"036\" is \"630\", and if we traverse the original string from last to first, we get \"630\" as well? \n\n                Actually: \n                  original string: \"036\": \n                    index0: '0'\n                    index1: '3'\n                    index2: '6'\n\n                Traverse from last to first: \n                    i=2: '6'\n                    i=1: '3'\n                    i=0: '0'\n\n                But the reversed string is \"630\" which is the same sequence: '6','3','0'. So we are doing the same.\n\n            Therefore, we can use:\n\n                for (int i = len_s2-1; i>=0; i--)\n\n            Then update:\n\n                int npmin = min(pmin + (10 - (v+1)), mmin + (10 - v));\n                int nmmin = min(pmin + (v+1), mmin + v);\n                pmin = npmin;\n                mmin = nmmin;\n\n            Then the result for the DP is min(pmin, mmin).\n\n      Step 6: Print the result.\n\n  However, note: the second program had a state initialization:\n\n          pmin = 1000\n          mmin = 0\n\n      Why 1000? It's a big number to represent infinity? But we are starting at the most significant digit? Actually, we are processing the least significant digit first (which is the last digit of the original string). The DP is designed to start at the least significant digit.\n\n  But the original state: \n        pmin = 1000, mmin = 0\n\n      Why? Because at the start (before any digits) we have no coins and we are in the state of having no carry? Actually, the state mmin=0 might represent that we have a carry of 0? But then why pmin=1000? It might be that we start with no carry and we haven't spent any coins? \n\n      Actually, the problem: we are at the least significant digit. We haven't processed any digit, so we have 0 coins and no outstanding carry? But the state for the next digit (if any) might require a carry? \n\n      The DP state: \n          pmin: the minimal coins so far if we do not have a carry going to the next (more significant) digit? \n          mmin: the minimal coins so far if we have a carry (we borrowed one from the next more significant digit) going to the next digit.\n\n      However, we are processing the least significant digit first. At the beginning, we haven't processed any digit, so we have 0 coins and we don't have a carry? Then we would set pmin=0? But the code sets pmin=1000 and mmin=0.\n\n      Let me try with a one-digit number: \"0\" -> then we form \"00\" -> then reversed is \"00\". Then we process:\n\n          First digit (least significant): v0 = 0.\n\n          npmin = min(1000 + (10 - (0+1)), 0 + (10 - 0)) = min(1000+9, 10) = 10\n          nmmin = min(1000 + (0+1), 0 + 0) = min(1001,0) = 0\n\n          Then set pmin=10, mmin=0.\n\n          Then next digit: v1=0.\n\n          npmin = min(10 + (10 - (0+1)), 0 + (10-0)) = min(10+9, 10) = 10\n          nmmin = min(10 + (0+1), 0+0) = min(11,0) -> 0\n\n          Then result = min(10,0)=0.\n\n      But the expected: 0 coins? So 0 is correct.\n\n      However, if the number is 1:\n\n          We form \"01\" -> then reversed: \"10\"\n          First digit (v0=0): \n              npmin = min(1000+9, 0+10) = 10\n              nmmin = min(1000+1, 0+0)=0\n          Then state: pmin=10, mmin=0.\n          Then next digit (v1=1):\n              npmin = min(10 + (10 - (1+1)), 0 + (10-1)) = min(10+8, 9) = 9\n              nmmin = min(10 + (1+1), 0+1) = min(12,1)=1\n          Then result = min(9,1)=1.\n\n      But the minimal coins for 1 is 1 (one coin of 1). So 1 is correct.\n\n      Therefore, the state initialization is as in the code.\n\n  So we'll do:\n\n      int pmin = 1000;\n      int mmin = 0;\n      for (int i = len_s2-1; i>=0; i--) {\n          int v = s2[i] - '0';\n          int npmin = (pmin + 10 - (v+1)) < (mmin + 10 - v) ? (pmin + 10 - (v+1)) : (mmin + 10 - v);\n          int nmmin = (pmin + v+1) < (mmin + v) ? (pmin + v+1) : (mmin + v);\n          pmin = npmin;\n          mmin = nmmin;\n      }\n      int result2 = pmin < mmin ? pmin : mmin;\n\n      Then print result2.\n\n  However, note: the original second program returns the result and then prints it. We are going to print it.\n\n  But note: the second program might have multiple test cases? Actually, the second program only reads one string. So we are safe.\n\n  But wait: the first program reads one test case and the second one too.\n\n  Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n\n      // For the first program:\n      int N, M, Q;\n      int a[50], b[50], c[50], d[50];   // Q up to 50? The problem doesn't specify, but the Python code uses Q as input. We can set a max, say 50.\n      int res1 = 0;   // the result of the first program\n\n      int A[10];   // current sequence for the DFS\n\n      void rec(int len) {\n          if (len == N) {\n              int ans = 0;\n              for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {\n                  // condition: A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]\n                  if (A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i]) {\n                      ans += d[i];\n                  }\n              }\n              if (ans > res1) res1 = ans;\n              return;\n          }\n          int last_max = (len == 0) ? 1 : A[len-1];\n          for (int i = last_max; i <= M; i++) {\n              A[len] = i;\n              rec(len+1);\n          }\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          // Step 1: Read input for the first program\n          scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &N, &M, &Q);\n          for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a[i], &b[i], &c[i], &d[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Step 2: Run the DFS\n          rec(0);\n\n          // Now, res1 is the integer result from the first program.\n\n          // Step 3: Convert res1 to a string and form the string with a leading zero.\n          char s1[20];\n          sprintf(s1, \"%d\", res1);\n          char s2[21];\n          s2[0] = '0';\n          strcpy(s2+1, s1);\n          int len_s2 = strlen(s2);\n\n          // Step 4: Run the DP for the second program\n          int pmin = 1000;\n          int mmin = 0;\n          for (int i = len_s2-1; i>=0; i--) {\n              int v = s2[i] - '0';\n              int option1 = pmin + 10 - (v+1);\n              int option2 = mmin + 10 - v;\n              int npmin = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n              int option3 = pmin + v+1;\n              int option4 = mmin + v;\n              int nmmin = (option3 < option4) ? option3 : option4;\n              pmin = npmin;\n              mmin = nmmin;\n          }\n          int result2 = (pmin < mmin) ? pmin : mmin;\n\n          // Step 5: Print the final result\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", result2);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  However, note: the second program in the original might have a different DP? Actually, the original second program has two functions: `main_b` and `main`. We are using the one from `main`. But the above DP is the one from `main`.\n\n  But wait: the original second program has two different main functions? And the one that is called is the one named `main`? Yes.\n\n  Also, note: the second program in the original had a `mod` defined but not used. We don't need it.\n\n  But note: the second program might have been designed for a different problem? However, we are just translating the code.\n\n  We must be cautious: the DFS recursion depth is at most 10, but the recursion might cause a stack overflow? In C, the stack is limited. However, the maximum depth is 10 and the branching factor is at most M (which is up to 10? because N<=10, and M is the maximum value, but the problem doesn't specify M). However, the problem says: M is read from input.\n\n  The constraints in the original problem? Not specified. But the first program uses recursion and in worst-case, the number of sequences is C(M+N-1, N) which is acceptable for M and N up to 10? Actually, M can be up to 50? But worst-case: if M=50, N=10, then the number of sequences is C(59,10) which is about 5.8e9, which is too many.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". We must assume the input sizes are such that the DFS will run in acceptable time? But note: the original Python program uses DFS and might be slow for large M and N? But the problem does not specify constraints.\n\n  But looking at the problem: the first program reads N, M, Q. Then the constraints? The problem does not specify. However, the second program is independent and expects a string. So we have to hope that the input sizes are small? But the problem says \"translate\", so we translate as is.\n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the sequence is non-decreasing and we are only storing the last element. The DFS recursion depth is N (at most 10). The branching factor is M - last_max + 1. The worst-case is when last_max=1, then we branch M times. Then the next level branches at least M, but actually the next last_max is at least 1, then 2, then ... so the total number of sequences is the number of non-decreasing sequences of length N with values in [1, M] = C(M+N-1, N). This is about 10^5 for M=10, N=10 -> C(19,10)=92378. For M=20, N=10: C(29,10)=20030010, which is 20e6, acceptable in C.\n\n  But if M=50, then C(59,10) is about 5e9, which is too many.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify constraints. We must assume the inputs are small? Or we have to optimize? But the original Python program uses recursion and might be slow for large M and N? We are just translating.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use iterative DP? But the problem says: translate.\n\n  We'll do the DFS recursion as in the Python code.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"translate the entire sequence\", so we are to translate the DFS recursion. We assume that the inputs are within the constraints that the original Python program can handle.\n\n  Therefore, we write the DFS as above.\n\n  Let me test with small values: N=1, M=1, Q=0: then the DFS will generate [1] and then the score is 0. Then res1=0.\n\n  Then the string becomes \"00\", then the DP: \n        pmin=1000, mmin=0\n        digit0: '0' -> \n            npmin = min(1000+ (10-1), 0+ (10-0)) = min(1000+9, 10) = 10\n            nmmin = min(1000+1, 0+0)=0\n        then pmin=10, mmin=0\n        digit1: '0' -> same as above: \n            npmin = min(10+9, 0+10)=min(19,10)=10\n            nmmin = min(10+1,0+0)=1 -> but wait: min(11,0)=0 -> so 0\n        then result2 = min(10,0)=0.\n\n  Then output 0.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  But note: the second program's DP: the state after the entire string (including the leading zero) is the answer.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  One more: N=1, M=1, Q=1: with a[0]=1, b[0]=1, c[0]=0, d[0]=5 -> then the sequence is [1]. Then condition: A[0]-A[0] = 0 -> true, so ans=5. Then res1=5.\n\n  Then form s2 = \"05\", then reversed order: first digit '5', then '0'.\n\n        pmin=1000, mmin=0\n        v=5: \n            npmin = min(1000 + (10-6), 0 + (10-5)) = min(1000+4, 5) = 5\n            nmmin = min(1000+6, 0+5) = 5\n        Then pmin=5, mmin=5.\n        Then v=0:\n            npmin = min(5+ (10-1), 5+ (10-0)) = min(5+9, 5+10) = 14\n            nmmin = min(5+1, 5+0)=min(6,5)=5\n        Then result2 = min(14,5)=5.\n\n  Then output 5.\n\n  But the expected for the second program? The problem the second program is solving: minimal coins for 5? \n        We can pay with 5 coins of 1 -> 5 coins.\n        Or we can pay with 1 coin of 10 and get 5 back -> 1 coin for the 10 and 5 coins for the change? Actually, the problem might be: we are allowed to use coins of 1 and 10, and we can get change? Then paying 10 and getting 5 back: total coins used: 1 (for the 10) and then the shop gives us 5 coins? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n  Actually, the problem: \n      We are at a shop. We can use any number of 1-yen coins and 10-yen coins, etc. But the problem is for multiple digits? \n\n  The second program is from an Atcoder problem: \n      https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc180/tasks/abc180_e?lang=en   -> but that is a traveling salesman.\n\n  Actually, the problem might be: \n      We have a number X. We can pay with a set of coins (each coin is 10^k for any k>=0) and we can also use the shop's coins (so we can get change). The goal is to minimize the total number of coins that pass hands (both the ones we give and the ones we get back).\n\n  For X=5: \n      Option 1: give 5 ones -> 5 coins.\n      Option 2: give one 10 and get 5 ones back -> total coins: 1 (the 10) + 5 (the ones we get back) = 6? \n      But the program computed 5? \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might count the coins we give only? Then option 2: we give 1 coin (the 10) and that's it? Then why 5 coins? \n\n  Actually, the state transitions are defined as:\n\n      npmin: the minimal coins to represent the current digit without carrying to the next? \n          without carry: we can either:\n              - from a state without carry: we pay (v+1) coins? Actually, no: the formula is:\n\n          npmin = min( \n              [if we are in the state without carry] then we can pay the digit v by giving 10 - (v+1) coins? (which would be change: we give a 10-coin and get (v+1) coins back? then the net coins we give is 1 (the 10) and we get (v+1) back -> total coins passed: 1 + (v+1) = 10 - (v+1)?) -> no, 10 - (v+1) is the change we get? \n\n          Actually, the interpretation is complex. But we are just translating.\n\n  Since the original second program for the input \"5\" would output 5? \n\n      In the second program, if we run:\n\n          s = \"5\"\n          then form \"05\", then reversed: \"50\"\n\n          Step1: v=0? -> no: the reversed string is \"50\": \n              first character: '5' -> v=5\n              then '0'\n\n          So the same as above: 5.\n\n      But the expected minimal coins? 5 coins of 1 is 5, which is the minimal. So 5 is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n  We'll write the C code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the second program in the original also had a function `main_b` that does a different calculation? But we are not using that.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the DFS recursion in the first program: the condition in the query uses indices a[i]-1 and b[i]-1. We have stored the current sequence in A[0..len-1]. So we use:\n\n      if (A[b[i]-1] - A[a[i]-1] == c[i])\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  We'll assume that the input constraints are such that the DFS recursion is acceptable.\n\n  Now, the entire C code:\n\n      We assume Q <= 50 (we set array size for a, b, c, d to 50).\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the maximum Q. We can set a max Q, say 50, but the problem says the first program reads Q. We can use dynamic allocation? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      int a[50], b[50], c[50], d[50];   // since Q is at most 50? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume.\n\n  But the problem says: the first program reads Q. Then we read Q quadruples. We can set the array size to the maximum Q we expect? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"You are given a set of Python programs\", and the Python program uses a list of size Q. So we can set the array size to the read Q? But in C, we can only use fixed size arrays. Since the problem does not specify the maximum, we set a safe maximum, say 100.\n\n  Let me change:\n\n      #define MAX_Q 100\n\n      int a[MAX_Q], b[MAX_Q], c[MAX_Q], d[MAX_Q];\n\n  Similarly, the string for the second part: the integer res1 can be at most ...? The d[i] are positive? and Q up to 100, and d[i] up to? not specified. But the string length of res1 will be at most 20 digits? So we set s1 to 20, s2 to 21.\n\n  Now, write the code.\n\n  Important: the DFS recursion: we are using a global array A and global variables N, M, Q, a, b, c, d, and res1.\n\n  We'll write the entire program.\n\n  One more note: the first program's DFS: the sequences are non-decreasing. The initial last_max is 1 if the sequence is empty, else the last element. Then we iterate from last_max to M.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Let's write the code."
