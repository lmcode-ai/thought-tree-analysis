Step 3: Convert ans1 to a string (using sprintf, but then we have a null-terminated string). We'll make a char array and write the integer to it. Step 4: Process the string (char array) with the second program's logic:\n\n        int num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0;\n        for (each character in the string until the null terminator) {\n            if the character is 'g': \n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    score += 1;\n                    num_p += 1;\n                } else {\n                    num_g += 1;\n                }\n            else if the character is 'p':\n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    num_p += 1;\n                } else {\n                    score -= 1;\n                    num_g += 1;\n                }\n            // else: do nothing (as in the Python code, no else branch)\n        }\n\n    Step 5: Print the score. Example: Input: \"10 2 3\" -> N=10, A=2, B=3 -> ans1 = 4 -> string \"4\"\n   Then process the string \"4\": \n        character '4' is not 'g' and not 'p', so nothing happens -> score=0. Output: 0.

Then ans = rep * A (nonnegative) + min(res, A) (nonnegative) -> nonnegative. So the integer is nonnegative. We don't have to worry about negative. Therefore, the above C program should work.

But the problem says they are in sequence.\n\n Let me re-read: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n But the two programs are:\n\n   Program 1: reads integers (N, A, B) and prints an integer (ans).\n   Program 2: reads a string (which is a sequence of 'g' and 'p') and prints an integer (score).\n\n How can the output of program1 (an integer) be the input to program2 (which expects a string of characters)? \n\n This suggests that the two programs are meant to be run on separate inputs? But the problem states they are in sequence.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the entire chain input is:\n   First, the integers N, A, B (for program1)\n   Then, the string for program2? \n\n But that would require two separate inputs. However, the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"same input\" meaning the input to the chain is the same as the original input to the first program? and then the output of the first becomes the input to the second.\n\n But the second program expects a string of 'g' and 'p'. The first program outputs an integer.\n\n This is a mismatch.\n\n However, looking at the provided example, we have two separate inputs? Actually, the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". \n\n But note: the first program reads three integers. The second program reads a string (which in the example is a string that might come from the next line?).\n\n How did the original run?\n   Suppose the input is:\n        \"10 2 3\\n\"\n        \"ggppgp\\n\"\n\n   Then the first program would read the first line and output an integer (say 5) and then the second program would read the second line and output a score.\n\n But the problem says: the output of the first is the input to the second. That would mean the second program would get the string \"5\", not the next line.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n   \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n   And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n   And: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\"\n\n This implies that the entire chain must be connected by data flow, not by reading from stdin in the middle.\n\n Therefore, the input to the entire program is the same as the input to the first program? But then what about the input for the second program?\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have two inputs: \n   The first program uses the first part of the input, and the second program uses the next part? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the chain is: \n   Input for the entire program -> First program (which produces output1) -> Second program (which takes output1 as input and produces output2) -> Output of entire program is output2.\n\n But the second program in the given code reads from stdin. We are not allowed to do I/O in the middle.\n\n Therefore, we must restructure: \n   The entire input to the chain is the same as the original input to the first program? But the second program requires a different input.\n\n This suggests that the provided two programs are not intended to be chained by the output of the first as the input of the second? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the example input for the chain is a multi-line input: the first line for the first program, and the second line for the second program? \n\n But then the first program outputs a number that we don't use? and the second program uses the second line? \n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n There is a misunderstanding.\n\n After re-reading the problem: \n   \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So the second program should take the output of the first program as its input.\n\n But the second program expects a string of 'g' and 'p'. The first program outputs an integer.\n\n This does not match.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way? Or perhaps the example is flawed.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire input is provided at once, and each program reads its input from the common input stream? Then the chain is just running one after the other, but the second program reads from the same stdin, which is still open? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program should read the output of the first program, not the next line of the original input.\n\n How can we reconcile?\n\n Let me look at the second program: \n   s = list(input())\n\n If the first program outputs an integer, then the second program would read that integer as a string? \n\n Example: \n   First program outputs: 5\n   Then the second program would read the string \"5\", which is one character.\n\n Then the second program would run on the string ['5'].\n\n But the original second program was designed for a string of 'g' and 'p'. \n\n This would not produce a meaningful result.\n\n Therefore, I conclude that the two programs are independent and are reading from the same stdin, but from different parts of the input. \n\n However, the problem explicitly says: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n Given the confusion, let's assume the problem intends the entire input to be:\n\n   Line1: the three integers for the first program.\n   Line2: the string for the second program.\n\n And the first program outputs an integer that we ignore? and the second program uses the second line? \n\n But that does not use the output of the first as input to the second.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the first program is a string representation of the integer, and that string is fed to the second program. \n\n Then the second program would process that string of digits? But the second program's logic is based on 'g' and 'p'. \n\n That does not make sense.\n\n After careful thought, I notice that the two programs are completely independent: they read from stdin and write to stdout. The problem says they are in sequence. \n\n So the entire input is:\n\n   First, the input for program1: \"10 2 3\"\n   Then, the input for program2: \"ggppgp\"\n\n And the chain would be:\n\n   Program1 reads the first line and writes an integer (say 5) to stdout.\n   Program2 then reads the next line? But the problem says the output of program1 is the input to program2. \n\n How would that work? We could pipe:\n\n        echo -e \"10 2 3\\nggppgp\" | python3 first.py | python3 second.py\n\n But then the second program would get only the output of the first (the integer 5) and not the string \"ggppgp\".\n\n This is not the same as having the second program read the second line.\n\n Therefore, I suspect the problem actually means that the entire input is provided at once, and each program reads from the same stdin sequentially. That is:\n\n   The first program reads the first line (three integers) and produces an output (which we don't use for the second program's input? but the problem says we do).\n\n   The second program is intended to read the next line (the string) but the problem says it should read the output of the first.\n\n This is a conflict.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will stick to the literal requirement: the output of the first program is the input string for the second program.\n\n Therefore, we must convert the integer output of the first program to a string and use that as the input to the second program.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read the first line (three integers: N, A, B).\n   Step 2: Compute the answer for the first program (as an integer).\n   Step 3: Convert that integer to a string (without any extra spaces, just the number as a string).\n   Step 4: Use that string as the input to the second program (so the string s in the second program will be the digits of the integer).\n\n   Then run the second program on that string.\n\n   The final output is the score computed by the second program.\n\n However, the original second program was designed for a string of 'g' and 'p'. But now we are feeding it a string of digits.\n\n This will produce a result, but it is not the same as the original if the original second program was reading the second line.\n\n But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" and \"when run on the same input\".\n\n The same input for the entire chain is the same as the input to the first program? Then the second program does not get the second line? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me re-read the problem statement: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we are only allowed to read from stdin once (at the beginning) and write once (at the end). And the intermediate data must be passed without I/O.\n\n Therefore, the entire input for the chain must be provided at the beginning, and the output of the first program is generated and then passed as the input to the second program without I/O.\n\n How was the original input provided? \n\n   The first program reads the first line (three integers).\n   The second program, when run separately, would read the next line (if available) or wait for input. But in a chain, the second program gets the output of the first as its input.\n\n So the entire input for the chain is only the three integers? \n\n Then what about the string for the second program? \n\n This leads to the conclusion that the second program is miswritten for the chain? \n\n Alternatively, the problem intended that the second program should be rewritten to take the output of the first? But the second program is fixed.\n\n Given the provided code, I must assume that the chain is:\n\n   Input to chain: the three integers (N, A, B) and nothing else.\n\n   Step 1: compute the integer result (ans) from the first program.\n\n   Step 2: convert ans to a string, and use that string as the input to the second program.\n\n   Then the second program processes that string (which is a string of digits) and produces a score.\n\n   Then the chain outputs that score.\n\n This is the only way to satisfy:\n\n   - The first block reads input (the three integers).\n   - The intermediate data (the integer ans) is passed without I/O (we convert it to a string in memory and pass to the second program).\n   - The second program processes that string without I/O.\n   - The last block outputs the final score.\n\n However, note: the second program originally read a string that was expected to contain 'g' and 'p'. Now we are feeding it a string of digits. The logic in the second program:\n\n   For each character in the string:\n        if it's 'g': ... \n        if it's 'p': ...\n\n But if we feed it digits, then every character is neither 'g' nor 'p'. Actually, the second program has an elif for 'p'. For digits, it will do nothing? \n\n   Specifically:\n      For a digit 'x' (which is not 'g' or 'p'), the second program's loop would do nothing? because there is no else clause.\n\n   Actually, the second program only has two cases: if x=='g' and elif x=='p'. For any other character, it would be skipped.\n\n   Therefore, the score would remain 0? and num_g and num_p would remain 0.\n\n   Then the output would be 0.\n\n But that is not the intended behavior of the original second program.\n\n This suggests that the two programs are not meant to be chained by the output of the first as the input of the second.\n\n Given the above, I suspect there is a mistake in the problem description or the provided programs.\n\n However, as an assistant, I must follow the instructions as literally as possible.\n\n Therefore, I will write a C program that:\n\n   1. Reads three integers (N, A, B) from stdin (the first program's input).\n   2. Computes the first program's answer (as an integer).\n   3. Converts that integer to a string (in base 10, without any extra characters).\n   4. Processes that string with the logic of the second program (which counts the score for a string of 'g' and 'p', but now we are feeding it digits, so most characters will be ignored?).\n\n   5. Outputs the final score.\n\n But note: the second program does not ignore other characters. It only checks for 'g' and 'p'. So non 'g'/'p' characters are skipped.\n\n Since the string we are feeding is composed of digits (which are not 'g' or 'p'), the second program would do nothing and output 0.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2 3\" \n   First program: \n        rep = 10 // (2+3) = 10//5 = 2\n        ans = 2 * 2 = 4\n        res = 10 - 2*5 = 0 -> min(0,2)=0 -> total=4.\n   Then we convert 4 to the string \"4\".\n   Then we run the second program on the list ['4']:\n        x = '4': not 'g' and not 'p' -> skip.\n        score remains 0.\n   Output: 0.\n\n But the original second program, if run separately on the string \"4\", would also output 0.\n\n However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n The original chain, if we run:\n\n        $ echo \"10 2 3\" | python3 first.py | python3 second.py\n\n   Then the second program would get the string \"4\\n\" (if the first program prints 4 and then a newline). \n\n   But the second program's input() reads a line. So s = \"4\" (without the newline? or with? Actually, input() in Python by default reads a line and strips the trailing newline. However, in the second program, they use:\n\n        s = list(input())\n\n   This would read the line and split into characters. The string would be \"4\", so the list is ['4'].\n\n   Then the processing as above: 0.\n\n Therefore, the behavior is as expected.\n\n But note: the original second program might have been designed to read a string of 'g' and 'p'. However, in the chain we are feeding it the integer string. \n\n The problem does not specify that the two programs are designed to work together. They are two separate programs that are chained arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, we must chain them as described.\n\n Steps for the C program:\n\n   1. Read three integers: N, A, B.\n   2. Compute ans1 = rep * A + min(res, A) as in the first program.\n   3. Convert ans1 to a string. (We need to allocate a buffer for the string. The maximum number of digits: the input N is an integer, so the result is at most around N, which is an integer. We can use a fixed buffer of 20 characters for 64-bit integers.)\n   4. Then run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n   The second program's logic:\n\n        num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0.\n        For each character c in the string (until the null terminator if we use a C string? but note: the string we built does not include the newline? But the original first program only printed the number without any extra? The Python print(ans) adds a newline.\n\n   However, in the chain, the second program reads a line. The first program's output is the integer and a newline? \n\n   How did the second program read? It used input(), which reads a line and strips the trailing newline. So the string s is the integer as a string without the newline.\n\n   Therefore, in our C program, we should simulate:\n\n        We build a string of the integer (without any extra character) and then process that string.\n\n   But note: the first program in Python uses print(ans) which outputs the integer and then a newline. The second program's input() then reads the entire line including the digits and the newline? but then strips the newline. So the list(s) would be the digits without the newline.\n\n   Therefore, we do not include the newline in the string we pass to the second program's logic.\n\n   5. Output the final score.\n\n However, what if the first program's output has multiple lines? It doesn't: it prints one integer and then a newline.\n\n But the second program only reads one line. So we only need the first line of the first program's output? which is the integer.\n\n Therefore, we only convert the integer to a string without adding a newline for the purpose of the second program's processing? \n\n Actually, the second program's input() reads one line. We are going to simulate that by having the second program's input be the string representation of the integer (without the newline). \n\n So we do not add a newline to the string we generate.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read N, A, B.\n   Step 2: Compute the integer result (ans1).\n   Step 3: Convert ans1 to a string (using sprintf, but then we have a null-terminated string). We'll make a char array and write the integer to it.\n\n   Step 4: Process the string (char array) with the second program's logic:\n\n        int num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0;\n        for (each character in the string until the null terminator) {\n            if the character is 'g': \n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    score += 1;\n                    num_p += 1;\n                } else {\n                    num_g += 1;\n                }\n            else if the character is 'p':\n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    num_p += 1;\n                } else {\n                    score -= 1;\n                    num_g += 1;\n                }\n            // else: do nothing (as in the Python code, no else branch)\n        }\n\n    Step 5: Print the score.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2 3\" -> N=10, A=2, B=3 -> ans1 = 4 -> string \"4\"\n   Then process the string \"4\": \n        character '4' is not 'g' and not 'p', so nothing happens -> score=0.\n\n   Output: 0.\n\n But if we run the original chain in shell:\n\n        $ python3 first.py <<< \"10 2 3\" | python3 second.py\n\n   The first program outputs \"4\\n\". The second program reads the line \"4\" (without the newline) and then processes the string \"4\", which has one character '4'. The second program would output 0.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n However, note that the second program might have been designed for a different input. But the problem does not specify that the second program should be run on a different input. It says the entire chain is run on the same input as the original chain. The original chain's input is the string \"10 2 3\", and that's all.\n\n Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Important: The first program uses modulo 10**9+7 but it doesn't use modulo in the computation? It's just defined. The computation is integer arithmetic.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read N, A, B.\n\n   Compute:\n        rep = N / (A+B);   (integer division)\n        ans1 = rep * A;\n        res = N - rep * (A+B);\n        ans1 += (res < A) ? res : A;\n\n   Then convert ans1 to a string.\n\n   Then run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n   Print the final score.\n\n Note: We must be cautious about integer division: the Python code uses integer floor division (same as C for nonnegative numbers). The problem does not state if N, A, B are nonnegative, but the example uses positive integers. We assume nonnegative.\n\n Let's write the C program accordingly.\n\n We'll use:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        int N, A, B;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &N, &A, &B);\n\n        // Compute the first program's answer\n        long long rep = N / (A+B); // integer division\n        long long ans1 = rep * A;\n        long long res = N - rep * (A+B);\n        ans1 += (res < A) ? res : A;\n\n        // Convert ans1 to a string\n        char s[21]; // enough for 64-bit integers (max 20 digits)\n        sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans1);\n\n        // Now run the second program on the string s\n        int num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n            if (s[i] == 'g') {\n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    score++;\n                    num_p++;\n                } else {\n                    num_g++;\n                }\n            } else if (s[i] == 'p') {\n                if (num_g - num_p > 0) {\n                    num_p++;\n                } else {\n                    score--;\n                    num_g++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", score);\n\n        return 0;\n   }\n\n However, note: the second program in the original code uses a list of characters. We are iterating over the string until the null terminator, which is the entire string.\n\n But what if the integer is negative? The problem states nonnegative inputs? The Python program uses nonnegative integers. The computation in the first program: N, A, B are nonnegative? The input uses map(int, ...) and the example nonnegative.\n\n We assume nonnegative.\n\n Also, note: the second program in the original code did not have an else for non 'g' and 'p', so we skip as above.\n\n But wait: what if the integer has a negative sign? For example, if the result is negative? \n\n   The first program: \n        rep = N // (A+B) -> nonnegative because N, A, B are nonnegative? \n        Then ans = rep * A (nonnegative) + min(res, A) (nonnegative) -> nonnegative.\n\n   So the integer is nonnegative. We don't have to worry about negative.\n\n Therefore, the above C program should work.\n\n Let me test with the example: \n        Input: \"10 2 3\"\n        ans1 = 4 -> string \"4\"\n        Then the second part: \n            for the character '4': not 'g' or 'p' -> skip.\n        score remains 0.\n\n        Output: 0.\n\n But what if we have a different input that results in a number that has the digit 'g'? Actually, the digits are only from '0' to '9'. There is no 'g' or 'p'. So the second part always does nothing.\n\n Therefore, the output will always be 0.\n\n This seems nonsensical, but it matches the chain.\n\n Alternatively, if the problem intended the second program to read the next line of the input, then we would have to read two lines. But the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\", meaning we read everything at the beginning.\n\n Then the chain input would be:\n\n        Line1: \"10 2 3\"\n        Line2: \"ggppgp\"\n\n And then:\n\n        First program: reads Line1 and outputs 4.\n        Second program: should read Line2? But the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will stick to the literal interpretation: the output of the first program is the input string to the second program.\n\n Therefore, the C program above is the solution.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and we are not: we read once at the beginning and print once at the end.\n\n But we are reading only one line? What if the input has two lines? \n\n The problem says: the entire input for the chain is the same as the original input to the first program. The first program only reads one line. So we only read one line.\n\n Therefore, we ignore any extra lines.\n\n But the example input for the chain is only one line? \n\n The original first program: \n        N, A, B = MI()   # reads one line\n\n So we read one line.\n\n Therefore, the C program above is correct.\n\n However, the original second program, if run separately, would read one line. But in the chain, that line is the output of the first program.\n\n So the entire chain input is one line.\n\n Therefore, we do not have a second line.\n\n I will write the C program accordingly.\n\n But note: the first program in the chain reads one line. The second program in the chain reads one line (which is the output of the first). \n\n The entire chain input is one line (for the first program). There is no second line.\n\n Therefore, the C program above is correct.\n\n Final code:"
