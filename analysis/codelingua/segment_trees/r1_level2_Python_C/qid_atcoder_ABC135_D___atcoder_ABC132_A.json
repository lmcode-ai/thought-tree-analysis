Count the distinct characters: if not 2 -> then \"No\". For each distinct character, check if frequency is 2. But note: the original code:\n\n            Sa = set(list(S))\n            if len(Sa) ! = 2: \n                print(\"No\")\n                exit()\n            for i in Sa:\n                if c[i] ! = 2:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    exit()\n            print(\"Yes\") So we can do:\n\n            int freq[256] = {0}; // assuming ASCII\n            int len2 = strlen(S2);\n            for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) \n                freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n\n            Then, we traverse the string to get distinct characters?",

We'll do:\n\n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            int flag = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) { if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                        flag = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct_count ! = 2) \n                flag = 0;\n\n            result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n        This is the same as the original code.",

But we can break early if we already know distinct_count>2? Actually, no: we are traversing the entire array. Alternatively, we can break the condition for the frequency only when we set flag=0? But we still have to count the distinct_count? So we can't break. But the frequency array is fixed size (256). So it's acceptable. Therefore, we do:\n\n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            int flag = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                        flag = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct_count ! = 2) \n                flag = 0;\n\n        Then result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n    But note: the original code breaks the entire program when it finds the first frequency that is not 2? Actually, it prints \"No\" and exits. But we are not exiting, we are setting flag=0 and then later check distinct_count. However, even if one frequency is not 2, we set flag=0, and then if distinct_count is not 2 we set flag=0 again. So it's the same. We'll use this. Summary:\n\n   We read two lines: S1 and S2.

But if we have two distinct and one of them is 2 and the other is 2, then countTwo=2 -> valid. However, what if we have one distinct? then countDistinct=1 -> invalid. Actually, the condition is: two distinct and both frequencies are 2 -> then countTwo must be 2. But what if we have two distinct and one frequency is 2 and the other is 2? Then it's valid. But also, what if we have two distinct and one frequency is 3 and the other is 1? Then countTwo=0 -> invalid. So we can do:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) \n                    flag = 0;\n                else {\n                    int distinct_count = 0;\n                    int count_two = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) { if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                            distinct_count++;\n                            if (freq[i] == 2) \n                                count_two++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (distinct_count == 2 && count_two == 2)\n                        flag = 1;\n                    else\n                        flag = 0;\n                }\n\n            This is efficient. However, the original code does not assume the length. It would work for a string of any length? For example, if the string is \"aabbcc\", then distinct_count=3 -> invalid. But the length is 6. But note: the condition of the problem: \"exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice\" implies the length must be 4. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (strlen(S2) ! = 4) {\n                result2 = \"No\";\n            } else {\n                // then check the frequency condition: two distinct and both appear twice. int freq[256] = {0};\n                for (int i=0; i<4; i++) \n                    freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n                int distinct = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) \n                        distinct++;\n                }\n                if (distinct ! = 2) \n                    result2 = \"No\";\n                else {\n                    // check each frequency: we know there are two distinct and the total is 4, so if one is 2 and the other is 2, then we are good.\n                    // but we can check: \n                    if (freq[(int)S2[0]] == 2) // then the other one must be 2? Actually, no: we have two distinct, and if the first character appears twice, then the other distinct character must appear 2 times (because 4-2=2).\n                        result2 = \"Yes\";\n                    else \n                        result2 = \"No\";\n                }\n            }\n\n        However, this is not robust: what if the two distinct characters are not the first one? We can do:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) { if (freq[i] ! = 0 && freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                    result2 = \"No\";\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            // but if we break out without finding a non-2, then we set to \"Yes\"? But we already know distinct==2, so if we don't break, then both are 2. Alternatively, we can:\n\n            int valid = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] ! = 0 && freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                    valid = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (valid && distinct == 2)\n                result2 = \"Yes\";\n            else\n                result2 = \"No\";\n\n        But note: if distinct is 2 and the frequencies are both 2, then valid will be 1. However, if distinct is 3? then distinct==2 fails so we skip. Actually, we already have distinct_count. So we can:\n\n            if (distinct ! = 2) \n                result2 = \"No\";\n            else {\n                // now we know there are two distinct, we check that both have frequency 2. for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        result2 = \"No\";\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    // but we must break only when we find an invalid one? Otherwise, we set to \"Yes\" after the loop?\n                }\n                // How to break and then set?\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) { if (freq[i] != 0) {\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            valid = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                result2 = valid ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n            }\n\n        But note: if we have two distinct and one of them is 3 and the other is 1, then we break in the loop and set valid=0.",

That is acceptable? But 100000 is acceptable? Actually, 100000 is acceptable in C. But why not break early? We'll do the length check. Implementation:\n\n   We assume the input lines are at most 100000 characters. We read:\n\n        char S1[100001]; \n        char S2[100001];\n\n        fgets(S1, 100001, stdin);\n        // remove newline:\n        int len1 = strlen(S1); if (len1>0 && S1[len1-1]=='\\n') {\n            S1[len1-1] = '\\0';\n            len1--;\n        }\n\n        fgets(S2, 100001, stdin);\n        int len2 = strlen(S2);\n        if (len2>0 && S2[len2-1]=='\\n') {\n            S2[len2-1] = '\\0';\n            len2--;\n        }\n\n   Then process S1 and S2. For S1: we have the string of length len1. For S2: we have the string of length len2 (without the newline). Then do the two computations. Finally, output:\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result1);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n Note: mod = 1000000007. Let me write the code accordingly. Important: the first program has a special case for n==1. We must do that. Let me test the first program with a small example. Example: \"?\" -> then n=1, so we output 1.\n\n Example: \"5\" -> output 1. Example: \"1\" -> output 0. Now, for the second program:\n\n   \"aabb\" -> \"Yes\"\n   \"abab\" -> \"Yes\"\n   \"aabc\" -> \"No\" (because distinct_count=3? but wait: distinct_count: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> distinct_count=3 -> then flag=0 -> \"No\")\n   \"aaaa\" -> distinct_count=1 -> \"No\"\n\n   \"a\" -> \"No\"\n\n   \"aabb\" is \"Yes\". But note: what if the string is \"aab\\n\"? Actually, we remove the newline. We'll assume the input is given as two lines. Example input:\n\n        ? aabb\n\n   Then output:\n\n        1 Yes But the first program: the string \"?\" (length=1) -> output 1. Then the second program: \"aabb\" -> \"Yes\". So the entire output:\n\n        1\n        Yes\n\n   Now, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are ready to code. We'll write the entire C program. Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        #define MOD 1000000007\n        #define MAX_LEN 100000\n\n        int main() {\n            char S1[MAX_LEN+1];\n            char S2[MAX_LEN+1];\n\n            // Read the first line\n            fgets(S1, MAX_LEN+1, stdin);\n            int len1 = strlen(S1);\n            if (len1>0 && S1[len1-1]=='\\n') {\n                S1[len1-1] = '\\0';\n                len1--;\n            }\n\n            // Read the second line\n            fgets(S2, MAX_LEN+1, stdin);\n            int len2 = strlen(S2); if (len2>0 && S2[len2-1]=='\\n') {\n                S2[len2-1] = '\\0';\n                len2--;\n            }\n\n            // Process the first string S1\n            long long result1;\n            if (len1 == 1) {\n                if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') \n                    result1 = 1;\n                else \n                    result1 = 0;\n            } else {\n                long long dp_prev[13] = {0};\n                // first character\n                if (S1[0] == '?') {\n                    for (int j=0; j<10; j++) dp_prev[j] = 1;\n                } else {\n                    int digit = S1[0] - '0';\n                    dp_prev[digit] = 1;\n                }\n\n                for (int i=1; i<len1; i++) {\n                    long long dp_curr[13] = {0};\n                    if (S1[i] == '?') {\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {\n                                    int new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13;\n                                    dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                int new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                                dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    for (int r=0; r<13; r++) \n                        dp_prev[r] = dp_curr[r];\n                }\n                result1 = dp_prev[5] % MOD;\n            }\n\n            // Process the second string S2\n            char * result2;\n            if (len2 != 4) {\n                result2 = \"No\";\n            } else {\n                int freq[256] = {0}; // frequency array for ASCII\n                for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n                    unsigned char c = S2[i];\n                    freq[c]++;\n                }\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                int flag = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                        if (freq[i] ! = 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count ! = 2) \n                    flag = 0;\n                if (flag) \n                    result2 = \"Yes\";\n                else \n                    result2 = \"No\";\n            }\n\n            // Output\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", result1);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Note: we use long long for dp arrays because the numbers can be large (mod is 10^9+7, but we are doing modulo at each step).

Therefore, we use long long. But note: the problem says the string can be up to 10^5 characters. The inner loop for the '?' case: 13 * 10 = 130 operations per character. Then total operations: 10^5 * 130 = 13e6, which is acceptable. So we write the code as above. Let me test with a small example for the first program:\n\n        S1 = \"1?\" (n=2)\n\n        Step0: first char '1' -> dp_prev[1]=1, others 0. Step1: second char '?'\n            for r=0 to 12: only r=1 has count=1. for j=0 to 9: \n                    new_rem = (1*10+j) % 13 = (10+j) % 13\n                    j=0: 10 -> dp_curr[10] += 1\n                    j=1: 11 -> dp_curr[11] += 1\n                    ... j=9: 19%13=6 -> dp_curr[6] +=1\n\n            Then dp_prev becomes: [0,0,...,1 at 6,10,11,...,19%13? Actually: \n                j=0:10 -> index10\n                j=1:11\n                j=2:12\n                j=3:0\n                j=4:1\n                j=5:2\n                j=6:3\n                j=7:4\n                j=8:5\n                j=9:6\n\n            Actually: (10+j) mod 13:\n                j=0: 10\n                j=1: 11\n                j=2: 12\n                j=3: 0\n                j=4: 1\n                j=5: 2\n                j=6: 3\n                j=7: 4\n                j=8: 5\n                j=9: 6\n\n            Then dp_prev[5] = 1? (because j=8 gives 5) -> but we are looking for remainder 5 at the end? Actually, the result1 = dp_prev[5] at the last step. In this case, we have 10 states each with 1, so dp_prev[5] = 1. Then output 1. What is the expected? The string \"1?\" can be replaced to form numbers from 10 to 19. Which of these mod13=5? 10 mod13=10\n                11=11\n                12=12\n                13=0\n                14=1\n                15=2\n                16=3\n                17=4\n                18=5 -> yes\n                19=6\n\n            So only 18. Then count=1. So our code is correct. We'll write the code accordingly. Note: the modulus operation in the inner loop: \n\n        new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13\n\n   But note: r is in [0,12] so r*10 is in [0,120]. Then add j (0-9) -> [0,129]. Then mod13: we can compute without overflow. So we are safe. Now, we write the code.",

(for n>=2)\n\n   But if n==0, then the for loop for i in range(n) does nothing, then we print dp[-1][5] -> which is the last row (which we never set). In the C program, we have:\n\n        if (len1==1) ... \n        else if (len1>=2) ... but we don't handle len1==0.

Similarly, the second program: if the string is empty, then distinct_count=0 -> \"No\", which is correct. Now, we write the complete code.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Python programs into one C program.\n The first program reads a string S and computes the number of ways to replace '?' in S with digits such that the resulting number mod 13 equals 5.\n The second program reads a string and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\n However, note that the second program uses the input() function again. But the problem states:\n   \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n In the original sequence, the output of the first program (a number) is printed, then the second program runs and reads a new string.\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n However, the second program does not take the output of the first as input. Instead, it reads a new string.\n\n This suggests that the two programs are independent? But the instruction says: \"a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: the entire sequence is executed. The first program reads a string and outputs a number. The second program then reads a string (which is independent of the first output) and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Here, the second program does not take the output of the first. This is a contradiction.\n\n However, looking at the code:\n\n File 1: reads a string S and then prints dp[n-1][5] (a number).\n\n File 2: then reads a string (which is a new string, not the output of the first program) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\n Therefore, the entire sequence would be:\n\n   Input for the first program: a string (call it S1)\n   Output of the first program: a number (mod 10**9+7) for the count of ways for S1.\n\n   Then the second program runs and reads a string (call it S2) and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". However, the second program does not use the number but reads a new string.\n\n This indicates that the two programs are independent and are run in sequence, but the input for the second program is not the output of the first. The problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\", meaning we must run both programs in sequence, each with their own input.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\".\n\n How can we reconcile?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n The original behavior is:\n\n   Step 1: Read string S1 and compute the number for S1 and print it.\n   Step 2: Read string S2 and check if it satisfies the condition and print \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This does not match the provided code.\n\n After re-thinking: perhaps the two programs are meant to be run independently? But the problem states they are in sequence and the output of the first is the input to the next.\n\n However, in the provided code, the second program does not use the output of the first. This is a problem.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire input is provided at once? For example, the input might be:\n\n   <string for first program>\n   <string for second program>\n\n And the output should be:\n\n   <result of first program>\n   <result of second program>\n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". That would mean the second program would get the number (from the first program) as its input. But the second program expects a string.\n\n There is a mismatch.\n\n After reading the problem again: \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n But the second program does not take the output of the first. Therefore, the only possibility is that the two programs are independent and the input to the entire sequence is two strings? However, the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\".\n\n How to design?\n\n We are forced to assume that the entire input for both programs is provided at the beginning. The first program reads the first string (until newline) and the second program then reads the next string (until newline). So the input file has two lines.\n\n Therefore, the C program should read two lines:\n\n   Line 1: the string for the first program.\n   Line 2: the string for the second program.\n\n Then it will:\n\n   Step 1: Process the first string to compute the number (as in the first Python program) and store the result (without printing it until the end? but the problem says only the last block should produce output).\n\n   Step 2: Process the second string to decide if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\n   Then the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we should output both results at the end? But the original programs output in two steps.\n\n However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original behavior is two outputs: first a number, then either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But the instruction says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we are only allowed to output at the very end. So we must output both results at the end? How? We can output:\n\n   <result1>\n   <result2>\n\n as two separate lines? That would be:\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", result1);\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", result2 ? \"Yes\" : \"No\");\n\n However, the original first program outputs a number and then the second program outputs a string. So we can output two lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". In our C program, we are not going to use the output of the first as the input to the second? Because the second program in the original code reads a new string, not the number.\n\n Therefore, we break the chain? The problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\", meaning we are not changing the input to the second program.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Read the entire input: two lines.\n\n   Process the first line (call it S1) to compute the number (mod 10^9+7) for the first program.\n\n   Process the second line (call it S2) for the second program.\n\n   Then output:\n        first the number (for the first program) on a line\n        then either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (for the second program) on the next line.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But in our C program, the second program does not take the output of the first. We are using the second line of input for the second program.\n\n This matches the original behavior: the two programs run independently on two different inputs.\n\n Therefore, we design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the first string (S1) and the second string (S2).\n\n   Step 2: For S1, compute the DP result (mod 10^9+7) as in the first Python program.\n\n   Step 3: For S2, check if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n   Step 4: Print the result of the first program (the number) on the first line, and then the result of the second program (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") on the second line.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". We are outputting two values at the end, so that's two outputs? However, we are at the end. And the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning the output should be the same as running the two programs in sequence.\n\n The output of the entire sequence would be:\n\n   <number>\n   <\"Yes\" or \"No\">\n\n So we output two lines at the end.\n\n However, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But in our design, the second program does not take the output of the first. We are breaking the chain? Actually, the original chain does not use the output of the first as input to the second either. The second program reads a new string. Therefore, the chain is broken? \n\n But the problem states: \"where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This seems to be a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe the two programs are not independent? \n\n Let me check the provided code again: \n\n   The first program: reads a string S and then prints a number.\n\n   The second program: reads a string (which would be from stdin, and after the first program has printed, the next read would get the next line of the original input?).\n\n So the entire input must be:\n\n   first line: the string for the first program.\n   second line: the string for the second program.\n\n And the first program outputs a number (to stdout) and then the second program reads the next line (from stdin) which is the second line of the input file.\n\n Therefore, in the C program we can simulate by reading the two lines at the beginning.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" meaning we read all input at the beginning.\n\n So we read two lines.\n\n Steps for the first program:\n\n   We are going to compute:\n        dp[i][r] = number of ways for the prefix ending at i such that the number mod 13 is r.\n\n   We have a modulus mod = 10^9+7.\n\n   Special case: if the string has length 1.\n\n Steps for the second program:\n\n   We check:\n        - The set of distinct characters in S2 must be exactly 2.\n        - Each distinct character must appear exactly twice.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll use:\n        int mod = 1000000007;\n\n   For the first program:\n\n        char S1[100000]; // but we don't know the max length? Let's assume maximum 100000.\n        We read with fgets.\n\n   Note: the Python input() for the first program: \n        return sys.stdin.readline()[: -1]   # This removes the last character, which is newline.\n\n   So we will read with fgets and then remove the newline.\n\n   Similarly for the second string.\n\n   We assume that the input has two lines.\n\n   Steps for the first program:\n\n        n = strlen(S1);\n        if (n == 1) {\n            if (S1[0] == '5' || S1[0] == '?') \n                result1 = 1;\n            else \n                result1 = 0;\n        } else {\n            We create a dp table: dp[n][13] -> but n might be large, so we do dynamic programming with two rows.\n\n            Actually, we can use two arrays: dp_prev[13] and dp_curr[13].\n\n            Initialize dp_prev: for i=0, we do:\n                if S1[0] is not '?' then set digit = S1[0]-'0'; then dp_prev[digit] = 1.\n                else, for j from 0 to 9: dp_prev[j] = 1.\n\n            Then for i from 1 to n-1:\n                for each remainder r in 0..12 in dp_prev:\n                    if S1[i] is not '?' then:\n                         digit = S1[i] - '0'\n                         new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13\n                         then add dp_prev[r] to dp_curr[new_rem]\n                    else:\n                         for each digit from 0 to 9:\n                             new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13\n                             add dp_prev[r] to dp_curr[new_rem]\n                Then set dp_prev = dp_curr (and reset dp_curr to zeros) and mod each value.\n\n            Then result1 = dp_prev[5] % mod.\n\n        }\n\n   For the second program:\n\n        We have a string S2 (without the newline).\n\n        Steps:\n            Count frequency of each character in S2.\n            Count the distinct characters: if not 2 -> then \"No\".\n            For each distinct character, check if frequency is 2.\n\n        But note: the original code:\n\n            Sa = set(list(S))\n            if len(Sa) != 2: \n                print(\"No\")\n                exit()\n            for i in Sa:\n                if c[i] != 2:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    exit()\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            int freq[256] = {0}; // assuming ASCII\n            int len2 = strlen(S2);\n            for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) \n                freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n\n            Then, we traverse the string to get distinct characters? Actually, we can traverse the frequency array? But note: we don't care about non-occurring characters.\n\n            We can:\n\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            valid = 0;\n                            // but we break? Actually, we can break only if we find one that is not 2? But we have to check all? Actually, the condition is that every distinct character must be 2.\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count != 2) \n                    valid = 0;\n\n            Then result2 = valid ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n        However, note: the original code breaks as soon as it finds one that is not 2? Actually, it does:\n\n            for i in Sa:\n                if c[i] != 2:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    exit()\n\n        So we can break early? But we are just counting distinct_count and then checking frequencies? We can do:\n\n            int distinct[256] = {0}; // we mark which we've seen? Actually, we don't need to.\n\n            We can:\n\n                int count = 0;\n                int flag = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n                    // We can break early? Actually, we are counting frequency in the first loop.\n\n                }\n\n            Alternatively, we do:\n\n                int distinct_chars[2];\n                int idx = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        if (idx < 2) distinct_chars[idx++] = i;\n                        else { // more than two distinct\n                            flag = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (idx != 2) flag = 0;\n                if (flag) {\n                    for (int i=0; i<2; i++) {\n                        if (freq[distinct_chars[i]] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But simpler: we can break the frequency check in the same loop? Actually, the original code does two checks: first the count of distinct, then the frequency of each.\n\n            We can:\n\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                    flag = 0;\n                } else {\n                    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                        if (freq[i] > 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But we can avoid the second loop by:\n\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            However, note: if there are more than two, we have already set flag=0? Actually, we break the chain: we do distinct_count first.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                int flag = 1;\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count != 2) \n                    flag = 0;\n\n            But note: if there are three distinct, we set flag to 0 because of the distinct_count, but also we set flag to 0 in the loop for the third character? Actually, we set flag=0 multiple times, but that's okay.\n\n            However, if we break early? We don't break in the loop. We can break if we see a frequency not 2? But we still need to count distinct_count? So we have to traverse all.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break only the frequency check? But we have to check every occurring character.\n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice\".\n\n            We can do:\n\n                if the length of the string is not 4, then it's automatically \"No\"? But note: the string can be longer? Actually, the condition is that there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice. Then the total length is 4.\n\n            So we can add:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) \n                    flag = 0;\n\n            But the original code doesn't check the length. It only checks the distinct count and the frequency.\n\n            Example: \"aabb\" -> length 4, distinct_count=2, each frequency=2 -> valid.\n\n            \"aaaabbbb\" -> distinct_count=2, but each frequency=4 -> invalid.\n\n            So we don't need to check the length? The frequency check will catch that.\n\n            But note: if the string is \"a\", then distinct_count=1 -> invalid.\n\n            So we don't need to check the length? However, we can use the length to break: if the length is not 4, then it's invalid? Because 2 distinct * 2 = 4.\n\n            Actually, the condition implies the string must be of length 4.\n\n            Therefore, we can:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) \n                    flag = 0;\n                else {\n                    // then check distinct_count and frequencies? Actually, if the string is \"aaaa\", then distinct_count=1 -> invalid, and if it's \"aabb\", then distinct_count=2 and each frequency=2 -> valid.\n\n                    // But what about \"aabc\": distinct_count=3 -> invalid? and we break.\n\n                }\n\n            But the original code does not assume the length. It just checks the distinct_count and then the frequency.\n\n            However, if the length is not 4, then it's impossible to have two distinct characters each appearing twice? Because the total length would be 2*2=4.\n\n            So we can:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) \n                    flag = 0;\n                else {\n                    // then check the distinct_count must be 2 and each frequency 2? Actually, if the distinct_count is 2, then the frequencies must be 2 and 2? Because the total is 4.\n\n                    // But what if one character appears 3 times and the other 1? Then distinct_count=2, but frequencies are 3 and 1 -> invalid.\n\n                    // So we still need to check the frequencies.\n\n                }\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) {\n                    flag = 0;\n                } else {\n                    // then we count distinct characters and check each frequency?\n                    // Actually, we can just check the frequency: if we have two distinct and the frequencies are both 2, then it's valid.\n\n                    // But we can also: \n                    //   if the set of frequencies is {2,2} then it's valid.\n\n                    // How: \n                    //   We have an array of frequencies. We can check that there are exactly two distinct characters and that each frequency is 2? \n\n                    // But note: we already have the frequency array. We can do:\n\n                    int countDistinct = 0;\n                    int countTwo = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                        if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                            countDistinct++;\n                            if (freq[i] == 2) \n                                countTwo++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (countDistinct != 2 || countTwo != 2) \n                        flag = 0;\n                    else \n                        flag = 1;\n                }\n\n            But note: if we have three distinct? then countDistinct=3 -> we set flag=0. But if we have two distinct and one of them is 2 and the other is 2, then countTwo=2 -> valid.\n\n            However, what if we have one distinct? then countDistinct=1 -> invalid.\n\n            Actually, the condition is: two distinct and both frequencies are 2 -> then countTwo must be 2.\n\n            But what if we have two distinct and one frequency is 2 and the other is 2? Then it's valid.\n\n            But also, what if we have two distinct and one frequency is 3 and the other is 1? Then countTwo=0 -> invalid.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if (len2 != 4) \n                    flag = 0;\n                else {\n                    int distinct_count = 0;\n                    int count_two = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                        if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                            distinct_count++;\n                            if (freq[i] == 2) \n                                count_two++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (distinct_count == 2 && count_two == 2)\n                        flag = 1;\n                    else\n                        flag = 0;\n                }\n\n            This is efficient.\n\n        However, the original code does not assume the length. It would work for a string of any length? For example, if the string is \"aabbcc\", then distinct_count=3 -> invalid. But the length is 6.\n\n        But note: the condition of the problem: \"exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice\" implies the length must be 4.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if (strlen(S2) != 4) {\n                result2 = \"No\";\n            } else {\n                // then check the frequency condition: two distinct and both appear twice.\n                int freq[256] = {0};\n                for (int i=0; i<4; i++) \n                    freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n                int distinct = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) \n                        distinct++;\n                }\n                if (distinct != 2) \n                    result2 = \"No\";\n                else {\n                    // check each frequency: we know there are two distinct and the total is 4, so if one is 2 and the other is 2, then we are good.\n                    // but we can check: \n                    if (freq[(int)S2[0]] == 2) // then the other one must be 2? Actually, no: we have two distinct, and if the first character appears twice, then the other distinct character must appear 2 times (because 4-2=2).\n                        result2 = \"Yes\";\n                    else \n                        result2 = \"No\";\n                }\n            }\n\n        However, this is not robust: what if the two distinct characters are not the first one? We can do:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                    result2 = \"No\";\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            // but if we break out without finding a non-2, then we set to \"Yes\"? But we already know distinct==2, so if we don't break, then both are 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n            int valid = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                    valid = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (valid && distinct == 2)\n                result2 = \"Yes\";\n            else\n                result2 = \"No\";\n\n        But note: if distinct is 2 and the frequencies are both 2, then valid will be 1.\n\n        However, if distinct is 3? then distinct==2 fails so we skip.\n\n        Actually, we already have distinct_count. So we can:\n\n            if (distinct != 2) \n                result2 = \"No\";\n            else {\n                // now we know there are two distinct, we check that both have frequency 2.\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        result2 = \"No\";\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    // but we must break only when we find an invalid one? Otherwise, we set to \"Yes\" after the loop?\n                }\n                // How to break and then set?\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0) {\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            valid = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                result2 = valid ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n            }\n\n        But note: if we have two distinct and one of them is 3 and the other is 1, then we break in the loop and set valid=0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do without the inner loop: we know the two distinct characters? We can store them? But we don't need to.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            int valid = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] != 0) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct == 2 && valid)\n                result2 = \"Yes\";\n            else\n                result2 = \"No\";\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            if (distinct == 2) {\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                valid = 0;\n            }\n            result2 = valid ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n        But we can combine: the condition is: distinct==2 and every occurring character has frequency 2.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            int flag = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        flag = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct_count != 2) \n                flag = 0;\n\n            result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n        This is the same as the original code.\n\n        However, note: the original code breaks as soon as it finds a frequency that is not 2? But our loop does not break. We can break early? \n\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) \n                        flag = 0;   // but we don't break: we need to count distinct_count? \n                }\n            }\n\n        We have to traverse the entire frequency array to count distinct_count? But we can break early if we already know distinct_count>2? Actually, no: we are traversing the entire array.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the condition for the frequency only when we set flag=0? But we still have to count the distinct_count? So we can't break.\n\n        But the frequency array is fixed size (256). So it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            int flag = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        flag = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct_count != 2) \n                flag = 0;\n\n        Then result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n    But note: the original code breaks the entire program when it finds the first frequency that is not 2? Actually, it prints \"No\" and exits. But we are not exiting, we are setting flag=0 and then later check distinct_count.\n\n        However, even if one frequency is not 2, we set flag=0, and then if distinct_count is not 2 we set flag=0 again. So it's the same.\n\n    We'll use this.\n\n Summary:\n\n   We read two lines: S1 and S2.\n\n   For S1:\n        n = strlen(S1);\n        if (n==1) {\n            if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?')\n                result1 = 1;\n            else\n                result1 = 0;\n        } else {\n            // use DP with two arrays: dp_prev[13] and dp_curr[13]\n            int dp_prev[13] = {0};\n            // initialize for the first character\n            if (S1[0] == '?') {\n                for (int j=0; j<10; j++) \n                    dp_prev[j] = 1;\n            } else {\n                int digit = S1[0] - '0';\n                dp_prev[digit] = 1;\n            }\n\n            for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n                int dp_curr[13] = {0};\n                if (S1[i] == '?') {\n                    for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                        if (dp_prev[r]) {\n                            for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {\n                                int new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13;\n                                dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + dp_prev[r]) % mod;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                    for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                        if (dp_prev[r]) {\n                            int new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                            dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + dp_prev[r]) % mod;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                // set dp_prev to dp_curr for the next iteration\n                for (int r=0; r<13; r++) \n                    dp_prev[r] = dp_curr[r];\n            }\n            result1 = dp_prev[5] % mod;\n        }\n\n   For S2:\n        int len2 = strlen(S2);\n        int freq[256] = {0};\n        for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n            freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n        }\n        int distinct_count = 0;\n        int flag = 1;\n        for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n            if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                distinct_count++;\n                if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                    flag = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (distinct_count != 2) \n            flag = 0;\n        result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n   Then output:\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result1);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n Note: we assume the input strings are not too long (max 100000 for S1, and S2 we don't know, but we'll assume 100000).\n\n However, the second program: the string S2 in the original code is read by input(), which reads one line. So it can be long? But the condition (exactly two distinct characters each twice) implies the length must be 4. But the original code doesn't assume that. It would work for a string of any length? For example, a string of length 100000 that has two distinct characters and each appears 50000 times? Then it would output \"No\" because each should appear exactly twice? \n\n But the condition: \"each appearing exactly twice\" -> so the total length must be 4.\n\n Therefore, we can break early: if the length of S2 is not 4, then we don't need to do the frequency array? We can set flag=0 immediately.\n\n        if (len2 != 4) {\n            flag = 0;\n        } else {\n            // do the frequency and distinct_count\n            // ...\n        }\n\n    This is more efficient.\n\n Let me update:\n\n        int len2 = strlen(S2);\n        int flag = 0;\n        if (len2 == 4) {\n            int freq[256] = {0};\n            for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n                freq[(int)S2[i]]++;\n            }\n            int distinct_count = 0;\n            flag = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                    distinct_count++;\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        flag = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (distinct_count != 2) \n                flag = 0;\n        } else {\n            flag = 0;\n        }\n\n        result2 = flag ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\n\n    But note: the original code doesn't check the length. So we are optimizing? But the condition requires the length to be 4. So it's safe.\n\n    Also, if the string is long (like 100000) and we don't check the length, we would do a frequency array of 100000 and then a loop over 256? That is acceptable? But 100000 is acceptable? Actually, 100000 is acceptable in C. But why not break early? \n\n    We'll do the length check.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We assume the input lines are at most 100000 characters.\n\n   We read:\n\n        char S1[100001]; \n        char S2[100001];\n\n        fgets(S1, 100001, stdin);\n        // remove newline:\n        int len1 = strlen(S1);\n        if (len1>0 && S1[len1-1]=='\\n') {\n            S1[len1-1] = '\\0';\n            len1--;\n        }\n\n        fgets(S2, 100001, stdin);\n        int len2 = strlen(S2);\n        if (len2>0 && S2[len2-1]=='\\n') {\n            S2[len2-1] = '\\0';\n            len2--;\n        }\n\n   Then process S1 and S2.\n\n   For S1: we have the string of length len1.\n\n   For S2: we have the string of length len2 (without the newline).\n\n   Then do the two computations.\n\n   Finally, output:\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result1);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n Note: mod = 1000000007.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n Important: the first program has a special case for n==1. We must do that.\n\n Let me test the first program with a small example.\n\n Example: \"?\" -> then n=1, so we output 1.\n\n Example: \"5\" -> output 1.\n\n Example: \"1\" -> output 0.\n\n Now, for the second program:\n\n   \"aabb\" -> \"Yes\"\n   \"abab\" -> \"Yes\"\n   \"aabc\" -> \"No\" (because distinct_count=3? but wait: distinct_count: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> distinct_count=3 -> then flag=0 -> \"No\")\n   \"aaaa\" -> distinct_count=1 -> \"No\"\n\n   \"a\" -> \"No\"\n\n   \"aabb\" is \"Yes\".\n\n   But note: what if the string is \"aab\\n\"? Actually, we remove the newline.\n\n   We'll assume the input is given as two lines.\n\n   Example input:\n\n        ?\n        aabb\n\n   Then output:\n\n        1\n        Yes\n\n   But the first program: the string \"?\" (length=1) -> output 1.\n\n   Then the second program: \"aabb\" -> \"Yes\".\n\n   So the entire output:\n\n        1\n        Yes\n\n   Now, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n   We are ready to code.\n\n   We'll write the entire C program.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        #define MOD 1000000007\n        #define MAX_LEN 100000\n\n        int main() {\n            char S1[MAX_LEN+1];\n            char S2[MAX_LEN+1];\n\n            // Read the first line\n            fgets(S1, MAX_LEN+1, stdin);\n            int len1 = strlen(S1);\n            if (len1>0 && S1[len1-1]=='\\n') {\n                S1[len1-1] = '\\0';\n                len1--;\n            }\n\n            // Read the second line\n            fgets(S2, MAX_LEN+1, stdin);\n            int len2 = strlen(S2);\n            if (len2>0 && S2[len2-1]=='\\n') {\n                S2[len2-1] = '\\0';\n                len2--;\n            }\n\n            // Process the first string S1\n            long long result1;\n            if (len1 == 1) {\n                if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') \n                    result1 = 1;\n                else \n                    result1 = 0;\n            } else {\n                long long dp_prev[13] = {0};\n                // first character\n                if (S1[0] == '?') {\n                    for (int j=0; j<10; j++) \n                        dp_prev[j] = 1;\n                } else {\n                    int digit = S1[0] - '0';\n                    dp_prev[digit] = 1;\n                }\n\n                for (int i=1; i<len1; i++) {\n                    long long dp_curr[13] = {0};\n                    if (S1[i] == '?') {\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {\n                                    int new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13;\n                                    dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                int new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                                dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    for (int r=0; r<13; r++) \n                        dp_prev[r] = dp_curr[r];\n                }\n                result1 = dp_prev[5] % MOD;\n            }\n\n            // Process the second string S2\n            char * result2;\n            if (len2 != 4) {\n                result2 = \"No\";\n            } else {\n                int freq[256] = {0}; // frequency array for ASCII\n                for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n                    unsigned char c = S2[i];\n                    freq[c]++;\n                }\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                int flag = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count != 2) \n                    flag = 0;\n                if (flag) \n                    result2 = \"Yes\";\n                else \n                    result2 = \"No\";\n            }\n\n            // Output\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", result1);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Note: we use long long for dp arrays because the numbers can be large (mod is 10^9+7, but we are doing modulo at each step).\n\n   However, the modulus is 10^9+7, and we are doing modulo at each step. The maximum value in dp_prev[r] is at most 10^9+7, so we use long long to avoid overflow.\n\n   But note: the state: dp_prev has 13 elements, and we are doing modulo at each step. The maximum value we add: for a '?' we do 10 * (current state value). So if current state value is up to 10^9+7, then adding 10 times that might be 10*(10^9+7) = 10^10+70, which is less than 2^35 (about 34 billion) and long long can handle.\n\n   But we do modulo after the inner loop? Actually, we do modulo at each addition.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n\n   But note: we are adding multiple times. The modulus is applied at every addition? Then we might get a value that is less than MOD. So we can use int? But MOD is 10^9+7, and the maximum value in dp_curr[new_rem] might be (from multiple additions) at most about 10^5 * 10 (if we have 10^5 steps and each step we add up to 10 times the previous state) -> worst-case exponential? But we are doing modulo at every step. Actually, the state is modulo 13, and we are doing modulo 13 for the remainder, but the count is modulo MOD.\n\n   However, we are doing modulo MOD at every addition? Then the numbers are in [0, MOD-1]. So we can use int? But MOD is 10^9+7, which is about 2e9, and int is at least 2^31-1 (about 2e9). So we use long long to be safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use int if we do:\n\n        dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n\n   But the intermediate sum might be large: if we are adding 10 times a number that is MOD-1, then the sum might be 10*(MOD-1) which is about 10^10, which fits in long long but not in int? Actually, 10^10 is 10 billion, which is less than 2^34 (about 17 billion) so it fits in long long, but if we use int we might overflow.\n\n   Therefore, we use long long.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string can be up to 10^5 characters. The inner loop for the '?' case: 13 * 10 = 130 operations per character. Then total operations: 10^5 * 130 = 13e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   So we write the code as above.\n\n   Let me test with a small example for the first program:\n\n        S1 = \"1?\" (n=2)\n\n        Step0: first char '1' -> dp_prev[1]=1, others 0.\n\n        Step1: second char '?'\n            for r=0 to 12: only r=1 has count=1.\n                for j=0 to 9: \n                    new_rem = (1*10+j) % 13 = (10+j) % 13\n                    j=0: 10 -> dp_curr[10] += 1\n                    j=1: 11 -> dp_curr[11] += 1\n                    ... j=9: 19%13=6 -> dp_curr[6] +=1\n\n            Then dp_prev becomes: [0,0,...,1 at 6,10,11,...,19%13? Actually: \n                j=0:10 -> index10\n                j=1:11\n                j=2:12\n                j=3:0\n                j=4:1\n                j=5:2\n                j=6:3\n                j=7:4\n                j=8:5\n                j=9:6\n\n            Actually: (10+j) mod 13:\n                j=0: 10\n                j=1: 11\n                j=2: 12\n                j=3: 0\n                j=4: 1\n                j=5: 2\n                j=6: 3\n                j=7: 4\n                j=8: 5\n                j=9: 6\n\n            Then dp_prev[5] = 1? (because j=8 gives 5) -> but we are looking for remainder 5 at the end? Actually, the result1 = dp_prev[5] at the last step.\n\n            In this case, we have 10 states each with 1, so dp_prev[5] = 1.\n\n            Then output 1.\n\n        What is the expected? \n            The string \"1?\" can be replaced to form numbers from 10 to 19. \n            Which of these mod13=5? \n                10 mod13=10\n                11=11\n                12=12\n                13=0\n                14=1\n                15=2\n                16=3\n                17=4\n                18=5 -> yes\n                19=6\n\n            So only 18. Then count=1.\n\n        So our code is correct.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the modulus operation in the inner loop: \n\n        new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13\n\n   But note: r is in [0,12] so r*10 is in [0,120]. Then add j (0-9) -> [0,129]. Then mod13: we can compute without overflow.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Now, we write the code.\n\n   Important: the first program might have a string of length 0? But the problem says: the first program reads a string. We assume at least one character? The Python code: \n        S = str(input())\n        n = len(S)\n        if n==1: ...\n\n   So we assume non-empty? But what if the string is empty? The problem doesn't say. But the first program: if n==1, then ... else ... So we handle n>=2.\n\n   But what if n==0? The Python program would output dp[-1][5] -> which is not defined. So we assume the input string is non-empty? \n\n   The problem says: the first program reads a string. We'll assume it's non-empty? But the input might be an empty line? Then we read an empty string.\n\n   The Python program: \n        if n==1: ... \n        else: ... (for n>=2)\n\n   But if n==0, then the for loop for i in range(n) does nothing, then we print dp[-1][5] -> which is the last row (which we never set). In the C program, we have:\n\n        if (len1==1) ... \n        else if (len1>=2) ... \n        but we don't handle len1==0.\n\n   We can add:\n\n        if (len1==0) {\n            result1 = 0; // because there are no ways to form a number? and we are looking for mod13=5 -> no way, so 0.\n        }\n\n   However, the problem states the input for the first program is a string of digits and '?'. It might be empty? \n\n   The original program: \n        for i in range(n): ... \n        then print dp[n-1][5]\n\n        if n==0, then we try to access dp[-1] -> index out of bounds.\n\n   So we must avoid that.\n\n   The problem says: the first program: \n        if n==1: ... \n        else: ... for n>=2.\n\n   But what if n==0? The problem doesn't specify. \n\n   We'll assume the input string is non-empty? Because the problem says: \"if n==1 ... else ...\" and then for n>=2.\n\n   But to be safe, we can handle:\n\n        if (len1 == 0) {\n            result1 = 0;\n        } else if (len1 == 1) {\n            ...\n        } else {\n            ...\n        }\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Similarly, the second program: if the string is empty, then distinct_count=0 -> \"No\", which is correct.\n\n   Now, we write the complete code.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        #define MOD 1000000007\n        #define MAX_LEN 100000\n\n        int main() {\n            char S1[MAX_LEN+1];\n            char S2[MAX_LEN+1];\n\n            // Read the first line\n            if (fgets(S1, MAX_LEN+1, stdin) == NULL) {\n                S1[0] = '\\0';\n            }\n            int len1 = strlen(S1);\n            if (len1>0 && S1[len1-1]=='\\n') {\n                S1[len1-1] = '\\0';\n                len1--;\n            }\n\n            // Read the second line\n            if (fgets(S2, MAX_LEN+1, stdin) == NULL) {\n                S2[0] = '\\0';\n            }\n            int len2 = strlen(S2);\n            if (len2>0 && S2[len2-1]=='\\n') {\n                S2[len2-1] = '\\0';\n                len2--;\n            }\n\n            // Process the first string S1\n            long long result1 = 0;\n\n            if (len1 == 0) {\n                result1 = 0;\n            } else if (len1 == 1) {\n                if (S1[0]=='5' || S1[0]=='?') \n                    result1 = 1;\n                else \n                    result1 = 0;\n            } else {\n                long long dp_prev[13] = {0};\n                // first character\n                if (S1[0] == '?') {\n                    for (int j=0; j<10; j++) \n                        dp_prev[j] = 1;\n                } else {\n                    int digit = S1[0] - '0';\n                    dp_prev[digit] = 1;\n                }\n\n                for (int i=1; i<len1; i++) {\n                    long long dp_curr[13] = {0}; // initialize to zero\n                    if (S1[i] == '?') {\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {\n                                    int new_rem = (r * 10 + j) % 13;\n                                    dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        int digit = S1[i] - '0';\n                        for (int r=0; r<13; r++) {\n                            long long count = dp_prev[r];\n                            if (count) {\n                                int new_rem = (r * 10 + digit) % 13;\n                                dp_curr[new_rem] = (dp_curr[new_rem] + count) % MOD;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    for (int r=0; r<13; r++) \n                        dp_prev[r] = dp_curr[r];\n                }\n                result1 = dp_prev[5] % MOD;\n            }\n\n            // Process the second string S2\n            char * result2;\n            if (len2 != 4) {\n                result2 = \"No\";\n            } else {\n                int freq[256] = {0}; // frequency array for ASCII\n                for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n                    unsigned char c = S2[i]; // to avoid negative indices\n                    freq[c]++;\n                }\n                int distinct_count = 0;\n                int flag = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                        distinct_count++;\n                        if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (distinct_count != 2) \n                    flag = 0;\n                if (flag) \n                    result2 = \"Yes\";\n                else \n                    result2 = \"No\";\n            }\n\n            // Output\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", result1);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", result2);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   We hope this is correct."
