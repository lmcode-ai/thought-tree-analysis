We can adjust by: \n             tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)   in Fortran, but we want non-negative. We can do: \n          tmp = mod(tmp, 2019) if (tmp < 0) tmp = tmp + 2019\n\n      But the original Java program does not do that. In Java, we can have negative remainders. The second program then uses the negative value as an index? That would be out of bounds. Therefore, we must avoid non-digit characters.

But digits will not be in that list. Therefore, we can write:\n\n          if (c == 'a' .or. c=='e' .or. c=='i' .or. c=='o' .or. c=='u' .or. c=='y') then\n              write(*,*) \"YES\"\n          else\n              write(*,*) \"NO\"\n          endif\n\n      But note: the third program in the original also checks for uppercase vowels? but then converts to lowercase. So we convert to lowercase first. Steps for conversion to lowercase: We can convert c to lowercase. Since c is a digit, converting to lowercase leaves it unchanged? We'll write a helper function or use:\n\n          subroutine to_lower(char_in)\n             character, intent(inout) :: char_in\n             integer :: k\n             k = iachar(char_in) if (k>=65 .and. k<=90) then   ! 'A' to 'Z'\n                 char_in = achar(k+32)\n             end if\n          end\n\n      But we don't need a subroutine for one character. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          c = S2(L:L) if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') c = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n          then check. But again, c is a digit, so it will not be in 'A'-'Z'. So we can skip. However, for generality, we do the conversion. Let's code accordingly. Additional note: the third program in the original reads the entire line.",

But the original string was \"1020\", and we want the last digit to be '0' (from the last integer) and then the next is '2' (from the last integer), then '0' (from the first integer) and then '1' (from the first integer). But the original string is \"1020\", so the last digit is '0', then the previous is '2', then '0', then '1'. This matches: \n             our processing: \n                first: '0' (from b(2)=20) -> last digit of the entire string\n                then: '2' (from b(2)=20) \n                then: '0' (from b(1)=10)\n                then: '1' (from b(1)=10) -> first digit of the entire string\n\n          So the order is preserved.",

However, the second program also does a step at the end: mod_cnt[0]++. We do that after the loop. And the second program's algorithm is designed for contiguous substring. This alternative method should be equivalent. Why?",

Note: In the second program, the empty string case: if there are no digits, then total_digits=0, then we skip the loop and then we do mod_cnt(0)=1. Then ans2 = 0 + (1*0/2) for all others, and then for i=0: 1*(0)/2 = 0? and then mod_cnt(0)=1 -> 1*0/2=0. Then ans2=0. That is correct. We'll output the final program accordingly.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC171_E) reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers.\n    It computes `r` as the XOR of all elements. Then it outputs an array where each element is `r XOR a[i]`.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_164_D) reads a string `S`. Then it processes the string to compute remainders modulo 2019.\n    It uses dynamic programming to compute the remainders of the suffixes (from right to left) and counts the frequency of each remainder.\n    Then it calculates the number of pairs (i, j) such that the substring S[i:j] is divisible by 2019, which is done by counting combinations of indices with the same remainder (including 0).\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_49_A) reads a line of text and checks the last non-space, non-question-mark character to see if it is a vowel (or 'y').\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is a sequence of integers (space separated) and the second program expects a string.\n\n How to chain?\n   The first program outputs a space separated list of integers. The second program expects a string (the entire input as a string of digits?).\n\n But wait: the second program expects a string of digits. The output of the first program is integers, which might be multi-digit and not necessarily digits.\n\n However, looking at the original programs, they are independent. The problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n Therefore, the output of program1 is the input to program2, and the output of program2 is the input to program3.\n\n But note: the second program expects a string of digits (like \"1817181712114\"). The first program outputs integers (like \"1 2 3\") which is a string of digits and spaces.\n\n The second program, however, only considers the digits and ignores the spaces? Actually, no: the second program uses the entire string including the non-digit characters? \n\n However, the second program does:\n   String S = sc.next();\n\n In the example, the first program outputs space separated integers. So the string S for the second program would be a string of integers separated by spaces.\n\n But the second program expects a string of digits (without spaces) because it does:\n   int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') ...\n\n So if there are spaces, then we subtract '0' from a space (which is 32) and that would be 32-48 = negative? and then modulo 2019? That would break.\n\n Therefore, we must adjust: the problem says the entire sequence. But note the first program outputs space separated integers. The second program expects a string of digits. This chain is broken.\n\n However, let's reexamine the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How can we fix the chain? We have two options:\n   Option 1: Modify the first program to output without spaces? But the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are allowed to change the internal data flow without I/O in the middle.\n\n   We are instructed:\n      - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n      - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid writing the intermediate results as formatted I/O. Instead, we will pass the data in memory.\n\n   The chain:\n\n      Program1: reads integers, computes an array of (r XOR a[i]). Then this array (of integers) is passed to Program2.\n\n      Program2: expects a string. But the output of Program1 is an array of integers. How to convert?\n\n      However, the problem does not specify the conversion. We must look at the intended behavior of the entire chain.\n\n      The original chain would run:\n\n        Step1: Run program1 -> writes integers separated by spaces to stdout.\n        Step2: Run program2 -> reads from stdin that string of integers with spaces, and then processes it.\n\n      But the second program is designed for a string of digits (without spaces). So the chain as given would break? \n\n      Actually, the second program (atcoder_164_D) is designed for a string of digits (like a big number). The example input might be \"1817181712114\", not a list of numbers.\n\n      Therefore, the chain as described by the problem might not be intended? Or perhaps the first program's output is taken as a string of digits? But note the first program outputs multiple integers.\n\n      Let me clarify: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of program1 is a string (with spaces) and that string is the input to program2.\n\n      However, the second program (atcoder_164_D) in the original is designed to read a string without spaces. So if we run the chain as:\n\n          echo \"2\\n10 20\" | java atcoder_ABC171_E | java atcoder_ABC164_D\n\n      The second program would get the string \"10 20\", which has a space. Then it would try to process the space as a digit? That would break.\n\n      Therefore, we must reinterpret: the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". But the original chain of programs would not work as intended? \n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the problem intends that we chain the programs by the meaning of the data, not the exact string? \n\n      However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we are to simulate the same I/O.\n\n      We have two choices:\n\n        1. In the Fortran program, we simulate the exact same string that would be passed. That is, the first part produces a string of integers separated by spaces, and the second part reads that string (including spaces) and then the second part must be adjusted? But the second part is designed for a string without spaces.\n\n        2. We reinterpret the chain: the problem says \"entire sequence\", so we must do the same computation without the intermediate I/O. But the second program expects a string. How to connect the integer array from the first program to the string in the second?\n\n      After careful thought, I think the problem expects that we simulate the exact same data flow. Therefore, we must produce a string that is the same as the output of the first program (with spaces) and then the second program processes that entire string (including spaces) as a string of arbitrary characters? \n\n      But the second program only considers the digits? Actually, no: it subtracts '0' and multiplies by a power of 10. So non-digit characters would cause negative or non-digit numbers. That is not intended.\n\n      Therefore, we must remove the spaces? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". How about we change the second program to ignore non-digit characters? But the original second program doesn't do that.\n\n      Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are allowed to avoid I/O and pass data in memory. So we can avoid generating the string with spaces? Instead, we can pass the integer array from the first part to the second part without the spaces? But the second part expects a string of digits.\n\n      How to convert the integer array to a string? We have to think: what is the intended input to the second program? The second program is designed for a string of digits. The first program outputs multiple integers. We must combine the integers without spaces? \n\n      But note: the first program outputs the integers as their decimal representations. So if the array is [10, 20], the output is \"10 20\". If we remove the space we get \"1020\", which is a different number.\n\n      The problem does not specify. So we have to stick to the original chain: the second program receives the exact string that the first program outputs. Therefore, the string for the second program is the space separated integers.\n\n      Then the second program would break because of the spaces? \n\n      However, let's look at the second program: it reads the entire string. Then it processes each character. The spaces are not digits. So the second program would compute:\n\n          For a space: (char) ' ' -> 32, then subtract '0' (48) -> -16, then mod 2019? Then negative mod? Then we have to adjust to non-negative.\n\n      But the original program would do that? And then the rest of the computation? \n\n      This seems very different from the intended use of the second program.\n\n      I suspect that the chain of programs is not designed to be connected. Therefore, we must assume that the input to the entire system is the input to the first program, and the output is the output of the last program. But the intermediate data must be passed as the original programs would pass via stdout and stdin.\n\n      Therefore, we will do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer n and n integers).\n        Step 2: Compute the first program's result: an array of integers (r XOR a[i] for each i). Then we form a string that is the space separated values of these integers? But note: the second program expects a string. However, the second program in the chain would read the string exactly as printed by the first.\n\n        Step 3: For the second program, we take the string from step 2 (which has spaces) and process it as the second program does: \n            We compute the remainders for every suffix? and then count the pairs.\n\n        Step 4: The second program outputs a long integer (the answer). Then the third program reads that integer? But the third program reads a line of text.\n\n        How about: the third program reads the entire output of the second program? The second program outputs a single integer (as a string) and then a newline? Then the third program reads that string? But the third program is looking for the last non-space, non-question-mark character. That would be the last digit of the integer? Or the newline? \n\n        The third program reads the entire line. Then it scans backwards until it finds a non-space, non-question-mark. Then it checks if that character is a vowel.\n\n      Example: \n          Step2: outputs the string: \"10 20\" (without quotes, but with space) -> then step3 (the second program) would process the string \"10 20\" and output an integer (say 42) and a newline.\n\n          Step4: the third program reads the string \"42\\n\" (if the newline is included) or just \"42\"? Actually, the third program uses `sc.nextLine()`, so it reads the entire line without the trailing newline? So the string would be \"42\".\n\n          Then it scans backwards: the last character is '2'. Then it converts to lower case (which is still '2') and then checks if it is a vowel? It is not, so it outputs \"NO\".\n\n      This is a completely arbitrary chain.\n\n      Therefore, we must implement:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the array a of n integers).\n        Step 2: Compute the first program's result: an array of integers (of length n) where each element is r XOR a[i]. Then we form a string: the integers converted to string and separated by a space? But note: we are not going to print, we are going to pass in memory.\n\n        Step 3: Take the string from step2 and process it as the second program: \n            Let S = that string (without a trailing newline? because the first program didn't output a trailing newline? Actually, the first program outputs the last element and then a newline? In the first program: the last element is printed without a space and then the program exits. But in Java, the last element is printed without a space and then the program doesn't output a newline? Actually, the first program: \n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    if (i != 0) System.out.print(\" \");\n                    System.out.print(r ^ a[i]);\n                }\n            -> This does not output a newline at the end? Then the second program reads the string without a newline? \n\n            However, the second program uses `sc.next()`, which reads tokens (without spaces? but the token is the entire string until whitespace? no, because the entire input is one token? Actually, the first program outputs multiple tokens (integers) separated by spaces. The second program reads one token? Then it would read the first integer and leave the rest? \n\n            But the second program reads the entire string? Actually, the second program does:\n\n                String S = sc.next();\n\n            This reads the next token (by default, until whitespace). So it would only read the first integer? \n\n            This is a problem.\n\n      We see that the chain is broken. \n\n      Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the entire output of the first program (including the spaces and without a trailing newline) is the input to the second program. However, the second program only reads one token. So we must change the second program to read the entire line? But the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". \n\n      Alternatively, we can change the second program to read the entire input? The problem does not say we cannot change the internal logic of the programs? But it says \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are to reproduce the same behavior of the chain.\n\n      How the chain runs:\n\n          Input to the entire system: \n             The input to the first program: \n                 n\n                 a0 a1 ... a_{n-1}\n\n          Then the first program outputs: b0 b1 ... b_{n-1} (space separated, no trailing space, and without a newline? Actually, the program doesn't print a newline? Then the second program would read the entire output as one token? No, because the output has spaces. Then the second program would only read the first integer? \n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n      After reexamination: the second program uses `sc.next()`, which reads the next token. The first program outputs multiple tokens. So the second program would read the first token. Then the third token would be left for the next read? But the second program does not read more than one token. Then the third program would try to read the next token? \n\n      The third program uses `sc.nextLine()`, which would read the rest of the line? But the first program's output is a sequence of tokens without a trailing newline? Then the second program reads the first token, and the next token is for the third program? \n\n      This is messy.\n\n      Given the complexity and the fact that the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must simulate the entire chain as if the programs are connected by pipes.\n\n      How does the pipe work?\n\n          The first program writes to stdout a sequence of bytes: \n              for the array: \n                  [b0] [space] [b1] [space] ... [b_{n-1}]\n\n          Then the second program reads from stdin: it calls `sc.next()` which reads the next token (by default, a token is until the next whitespace). So it reads the first token (b0 as a string). Then the rest of the output (spaces and other integers) remains in the buffer? But the second program doesn't read them. Then it processes only the first integer? \n\n          Then the third program would try to read the next line? which would be the rest of the tokens? \n\n      This is not what the second program is designed for (which expects one string of digits).\n\n      Therefore, I conclude that the chain as provided is not compatible. \n\n      However, the problem states that we are to translate the entire sequence. So we must assume that the output of the first program is the input to the second program as a single string? and the second program reads the entire input? \n\n      How to make the second program read the entire input? We can change the second program to read the entire next line? But the problem does not allow changing the internal logic arbitrarily.\n\n      Alternatively, note the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are allowed to avoid I/O. So we can pass the entire string that the first program would have written to stdout as a string to the second program's logic.\n\n      And for the second program, we change the reading part: instead of reading from stdin, we use the string we have in memory.\n\n      Similarly, the second program's output is an integer, which it prints. Then the third program reads that integer as a string? So we must form the string of that integer and then pass it to the third program.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the array a (n integers).\n\n        Step 2: \n            Compute r = XOR of a[i] for all i.\n            Create an array b of length n: b(i) = r XOR a(i)\n\n            Then form a string S1: \n                For i in 0 to n-1:\n                    convert b(i) to a string, and append it to S1.\n                    If i < n-1, append a space.\n\n        Step 3: \n            Now, the second program takes the string S1 as input (without a trailing newline? because we didn't add one).\n\n            We simulate the second program:\n\n                N = len(S1)\n                We need to compute:\n                  mod_arr[0..N-1] and mod_cnt[0..2018] (initialized to 0)\n\n                radix = 1\n                For i from 0 to N-1 (processing from the last character backwards? because the string is from left to right, but the program processes from rightmost to leftmost):\n\n                But note: the second program does:\n\n                    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                        int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n                        if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n                        mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n                        mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n                        radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n                    }\n\n                However, this expects the string to be a string of digits. But our string S1 may contain spaces? \n\n                We have two options:\n\n                  Option A: Remove the spaces from S1? But that would change the input. The original chain has spaces.\n\n                  Option B: Process the string as is? Then when we encounter a space, we get a negative number? and then we take modulo 2019? \n\n                How does Java handle negative mod? In Java, the mod operation for negative numbers can yield negative. But we see the program then does:\n\n                    if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n\n                Then we store that negative? Then we do mod_cnt[negative]++? which would crash because negative index.\n\n                This is not acceptable.\n\n                Therefore, we must reinterpret the chain: the second program is designed for a string of digits. The first program outputs integers in base 10, but with spaces. We must remove the spaces? \n\n                However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The identical behavior would be to have the second program read the first token only? \n\n                But then the second program would process only the first integer? and the third program would read the next token? \n\n                The third program reads the entire next line? which would be the second token? \n\n                This is not the intended behavior of the second program.\n\n      Given the complexity, I think there is a misunderstanding in the problem. The three programs are independent and not designed to be chained. The problem might be to run them sequentially on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n      After re\u2010reading the problem: it says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". So they are meant to be chained. Therefore, the output of the first should be compatible with the input of the second.\n\n      How to achieve compatibility? We must change the first program to output a string without spaces? But the problem says \"without I/O in the middle\", meaning we are not bound to the exact formatting if we avoid I/O.\n\n      We are instructed to avoid intermediate I/O. So we can pass the data in memory in a compatible format.\n\n      Let me change the plan:\n\n        We will not generate the string with spaces for the second program. Instead, we will generate a string that is the concatenation of the decimal representations of the integers in the array b. This is because the second program expects a string of digits.\n\n        Why is this valid? The problem says \"behaves identically\" for the same input. But note: the first program in the chain would output spaces, but the second program in the chain would only read the first token (the first integer) if we use `sc.next()`. That is not what the second program is designed for. The second program is designed for a single string of digits.\n\n        Therefore, to make the chain work as intended (as if the first program's output was a string of digits without spaces), we will remove the spaces.\n\n        This is a deviation from the exact byte stream, but it matches the intended input for the second program.\n\n        And the problem does not specify the exact byte stream, but the behavior. The behavior of the chain should be the same as if the first program output a string of digits (without spaces) and the second program read that entire string.\n\n        How to justify? The problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". If the first program had been modified to output without spaces, then the chain would work. And the first program's output without spaces is still a representation of the same integers? \n\n        But note: the first program outputs the integers in decimal. Concatenating the decimal representations of the integers without spaces changes the number. For example, [10,20] becomes \"1020\", which is one thousand twenty, whereas the original string \"10 20\" is two numbers.\n\n        The second program is counting substrings that are numbers divisible by 2019. In the string \"1020\", the substrings that are numbers include \"1020\", \"10\", \"02\", \"020\", etc. In the string \"10 20\", we have \"10\", \"0\", \"20\", etc. They are different.\n\n        Therefore, we must not remove the spaces.\n\n      I see no clean solution. I will assume that the problem intends that the second program is given the string exactly as the first program outputs it (with spaces). Then we must process that string in the second program. We can modify the second program to skip non-digit characters? \n\n      But the problem does not allow changing the internal logic. However, we are translating, so we can adapt as long as the overall behavior of the chain is preserved.\n\n      How about: in the second program's processing, if we encounter a non-digit, we skip that character? But the original second program does not do that.\n\n      Alternatively, we can process the string including spaces and hope that the negative modulo is handled by Fortran the same as Java? But Fortran's modulo for negative numbers might be different.\n\n      Let me check: Java's `%` for negative: \n          (-16) % 2019 = -16 in Java? \n          We can adjust by: \n             tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)   in Fortran, but we want non-negative.\n\n      We can do: \n          tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n          if (tmp < 0) tmp = tmp + 2019\n\n      But the original Java program does not do that. In Java, we can have negative remainders.\n\n      The second program then uses the negative value as an index? That would be out of bounds.\n\n      Therefore, we must avoid non-digit characters.\n\n      Given the above, I decide to change the second program's processing to skip non-digit characters. This is a deviation from the original second program, but it is necessary to make the chain work. Alternatively, we could remove the non-digit characters from the string before processing in the second program.\n\n      Steps for the second program in our combined code:\n\n          We will take the string S1 (which is the space-separated integers) and remove any non-digit characters? or only spaces? We remove spaces and any other non-digit? But the string only contains digits and spaces. So we remove spaces.\n\n          Then we get a string of digits. Then we process that string.\n\n      This way, the string passed to the second program's logic is the concatenation of the digits of all the integers. This is different from the original second program's input, but it is the only way to avoid crashes and to have a meaningful chain.\n\n      And note: the problem does not specify the intermediate data format. We are avoiding I/O, so we are free to pass the data in a compatible format.\n\n      Then the third program: the second program outputs a long integer (ans). Then we form a string S2 = the decimal representation of ans (without spaces) and then pass that to the third program.\n\n      The third program will then check the last character of that string.\n\n      Summary of the combined Fortran program:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program: integer n, and then n integers.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the XOR of the n integers -> r.\n                Create an array b of n integers: b(i) = XOR(r, a(i))\n\n        Step 3: Convert the array b to a string by concatenating the decimal representations of the integers (without spaces? but wait, we decided to remove spaces later? no, we will remove spaces in the second program's preprocessing). Alternatively, we can form a string without spaces in the first place? \n\n                But note: the first program in the original outputs spaces. We are not bound to that because we are not doing I/O. We are free to pass the data in a way that the second program can process.\n\n                We will form a string without any non-digit characters: by concatenating the digits of the integers.\n\n                How? For example, b = [10, 20] -> we form \"1020\".\n\n        Step 4: Use the string from step3 as the input to the second program.\n\n        Step 5: In the second program, we have a string S (which is the concatenated digits). We then do:\n\n                N = len_trim(S)   [but note: we are storing it as a string, so we know the length]\n\n                We then compute the mod_arr and mod_cnt as in the second program.\n\n        Step 6: Compute the answer for the second program: \n                ans2 = 0\n                mod_cnt[0] = mod_cnt[0] + 1   (because in the second program, they do mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop? actually in the original: after the loop they do mod_cnt[0]++)\n\n                Then for i=0 to 2018, \n                   ans2 = ans2 + mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2\n\n        Step 7: Convert ans2 to a string S2 (without spaces, just the decimal digits).\n\n        Step 8: For the third program, take the string S2 and find the last non-space, non-question-mark character. But our string S2 has no spaces or '?'. So we take the last character.\n\n                Convert that character to lowercase? (if it is uppercase) but our string is digits, so no letters? Then we check if that character is a vowel or 'y'. Since it's a digit, it won't be.\n\n                Therefore, the third program will always output \"NO\", unless the last digit is 'a', 'e', ... which is impossible.\n\n        This seems not useful.\n\n      Alternatively, we must pass the string exactly as the second program would have outputted it? The second program outputs the integer and then a newline. Then the third program reads the entire line? which would be the string of the integer and the newline? But the newline is whitespace. The third program ignores trailing whitespace.\n\n        Example: \n          ans2 = 42 -> string \"42\\n\"\n          The third program reads that string? then it scans backwards: \n             The last non-space, non-question-mark is '2'.\n\n        So we form a string for the third program: the string representation of ans2 (without any extra spaces) and then we do not add a newline? because the third program uses readLine, which would not include the newline.\n\n        In our combined program, we do not do I/O until the end. So we can pass the string representation of ans2 (without newline) to the third program.\n\n        Then the third program will look at the last character of that string.\n\n      Therefore, the third program's input is the string of the integer (without any newline).\n\n      Example: if ans2 = 42, then the string is \"42\", and the last character is '2'.\n\n      Then the third program will output \"NO\".\n\n      But what if the second program outputs a number that ends with a digit that is one of the vowels? like 5a? that is not possible because it's a number.\n\n      Therefore, the third program will always output \"NO\", which is not what the chain would do if the second program's output ended with a vowel letter.\n\n      However, the second program outputs an integer. The string representation of the integer only contains digits. The only vowels are letters. So the last character will always be a digit, never a vowel. Therefore, the third program will always output \"NO\".\n\n      This is the behavior of the chain: \n          Input: \n             n and n integers -> first program outputs a list of integers (space separated) \n          Then the second program reads the first token (the first integer) and processes it as a string of digits, then outputs an integer (which is a number of type long) as a string of digits.\n          Then the third program reads that string of digits and checks the last character: it is a digit, so it prints \"NO\".\n\n      Therefore, we can hardcode the third program's output as \"NO\", but that would be an optimization. We are to simulate.\n\n      Steps in Fortran:\n\n        1. Read n and the array a of n integers.\n\n        2. Compute r = XOR of a(i) for i=1..n\n           Then compute b(i) = XOR(r, a(i)) for i=1..n\n\n        3. Form a string S1 by concatenating the decimal representations of b(i) without any separators.\n\n        4. Let N = len(S1)\n\n        5. Allocate mod_arr(0:N-1) and mod_cnt(0:2018) (using 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Fortran usually 1-indexed, but the algorithm uses 0-indexed. We can use 0-indexed arrays by using 0 as the lower bound? or adjust the indices)\n\n        6. Initialize:\n             mod_cnt = 0\n             radix = 1\n             ! We are processing from the last character to the first? \n             ! But the original program does for i=0 to N-1: \n             !   character at position N-1-i (0-indexed in Java)\n\n             ! Let me store the string in a variable and then index from 1 to N (Fortran style)\n\n             ! We'll use: do i = 1, N\n             !   j = N - i + 1   [so that i=1 corresponds to the last character?]\n\n             ! But the original does the last character first.\n\n        7. Do i = 1, N   [i from 1 to N, where i=1 is the first character in the string? but we want to start from the last]\n\n           Instead, let's do:\n\n             do i = 0, N-1\n                 idx_char = S1(N-i:N-i)   ! the character at position N-i (1-indexed: the first character is at 1, last at N)\n                 digit = ICHAR(idx_char) - ICHAR('0')\n                 tmp = digit * radix\n                 if (i>0) then\n                     tmp = tmp + mod_arr(i-1)   ! mod_arr for the previous index\n                 end if\n                 tmp = MOD(tmp, 2019)\n                 ! But note: tmp might be negative? no, because digit is between 0 and 9, and radix is positive, and previous mod_arr are in [0,2018]\n                 mod_arr(i) = tmp\n                 mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                 radix = MOD(radix * 10, 2019)\n             end do\n\n        8. Then mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n        9. ans2 = 0\n           do i = 0, 2018\n               ans2 = ans2 + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n           end do\n\n        10. Convert ans2 to a string S2 (without any extra spaces, just the digits)\n\n        11. Let L = len_trim(S2)   [but S2 has no trailing spaces, so L is the length]\n            We want the last non-space, non-question-mark in S2. Since S2 has no spaces or '?', we take the last character: char_last = S2(L:L)\n\n        12. Convert char_last to lowercase: but it is a digit, so we can just check if it is one of the vowels or 'y'? \n\n            vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u','y'] (and their uppercase? but we have digits -> no)\n\n            Since it's a digit, it will not be in the vowels.\n\n            Therefore, we set the result to \"NO\"\n\n        13. Write the result (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") to output.\n\n      However, what if the second program's output is a number that in its string form has a last character that is a letter? That is not possible because it's an integer.\n\n      Therefore, we can simply output \"NO\".\n\n      But to be safe, we'll implement the check.\n\n      Note: The third program converts the character to lowercase. So if by any chance we have a letter, we convert it to lowercase.\n\n      Steps 11 and 12 in detail:\n\n          Let S2 be the string representation of ans2 (which is an integer, so only digits).\n\n          Set the character to check: c = the last character of S2.\n\n          Convert c to lowercase: \n             We can use the IACHAR to get the code, and if it is uppercase, convert to lowercase. But since it's a digit, we can skip.\n\n          Check: \n             if c is one of 'a','e','i','o','u','y' (in lowercase) then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n          But digits will not be in that list.\n\n      Therefore, we can write:\n\n          if (c == 'a' .or. c=='e' .or. c=='i' .or. c=='o' .or. c=='u' .or. c=='y') then\n              write(*,*) \"YES\"\n          else\n              write(*,*) \"NO\"\n          endif\n\n      But note: the third program in the original also checks for uppercase vowels? but then converts to lowercase. So we convert to lowercase first.\n\n      Steps for conversion to lowercase: \n          We can convert c to lowercase. Since c is a digit, converting to lowercase leaves it unchanged? \n\n          We'll write a helper function or use:\n\n          subroutine to_lower(char_in)\n             character, intent(inout) :: char_in\n             integer :: k\n             k = iachar(char_in)\n             if (k>=65 .and. k<=90) then   ! 'A' to 'Z'\n                 char_in = achar(k+32)\n             end if\n          end\n\n      But we don't need a subroutine for one character.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          c = S2(L:L)\n          if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') c = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n          then check.\n\n      But again, c is a digit, so it will not be in 'A'-'Z'. So we can skip.\n\n      However, for generality, we do the conversion.\n\n      Let's code accordingly.\n\n      Additional note: the third program in the original reads the entire line. The entire line for the third program is the string of the integer (without any extra spaces). So we don't have newline in the string.\n\n      Implementation in Fortran:\n\n        We assume the input for the first program is read from stdin.\n\n        The entire program:\n\n          program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            !

Traverse from the end to the beginning to find the last non-space, non-question-mark\n            do i = length, 1, -1\n                if (S2(i:i) /= ' ' .and. S2(i:i) /= '?') then\n                    c = S2(i:i)\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! If the entire string is spaces and '?', then c remains space? but we have at least one digit.\n\n            ! Convert c to lowercase if it is uppercase\n            if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                c = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 12: check if c is vowel or 'y'\n            if (c == 'a' .or. c=='e' .or. c=='i' .or. c=='o' .or. c=='u' .or. c=='y') then\n                write(*,*) \"YES\"\n            else\n                write(*,*) \"NO\"\n            end if\n\n          end program combined\n\n      Note: \n        - In the second program, we did an extra step to ensure non-negative modulo. The original Java program does not do that. But in our chain, the digit is always nonnegative, and the radix is nonnegative, and the previous mod_arr is nonnegative (because we adjusted) so it should be nonnegative. But we did an adjustment just in case.\n\n        - We assume that the total length of the string S1 (which is the concatenation of the integers) is not too long. The maximum integer in b might be up to 2e5? and the string representation of an integer is at most 6 digits. So for n up to 200000, the total length would be 1.2e6? which is acceptable? But we set S1 to 200000, which is too small.\n\n      We must increase the length of S1.\n\n      How big can the integers be? The problem does not say. But in the first program, the integers are read as int. So they are up to 2^31-1, which is 10 digits. For n up to 200000, the total length is 2000000. We can set:\n\n          character(len=2000000) :: S1\n\n      Similarly, the string for S2: the maximum value of ans2? It is the number of substrings that are divisible by 2019. The maximum number of substrings is n*(n+1)/2, which for n=2000000 is 2e12, which has 13 digits. So 100 is enough.\n\n      Also, for the array mod_arr(0:N_len-1): N_len can be 2000000, which is 2e6 integers, about 8 MB? acceptable.\n\n      But note: the original second program had N as the length of the string. And our string S1 is the concatenated digits of the first program's output, which can be 2e6 in length. The array mod_arr(0:1999999) is 2e6 integers, which is acceptable.\n\n      Let's adjust.\n\n      However, note: the first program might have a constraint on n? in the original first program, n is read, but the problem does not specify bounds. We assume n is not too large.\n\n      But to be safe, we use dynamic allocation for the string? We don't need to, because we set the length to 2000000.\n\n      Alternatively, we can compute the total length:\n\n          total_length = 0\n          do i = 1, n\n             write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n             total_length = total_length + len_trim(temp_str)\n          end do\n\n          then we can allocate a character string of that length? But Fortran requires constant length in the type? Not necessarily, we can use a very large number.\n\n      We'll set:\n\n          character(len=2000000) :: S1   ! for up to 2e6 characters.\n\n      But if the total_length exceeds 2000000, we have a problem.\n\n      Alternatively, we can build the string in a variable with sufficient length.\n\n      How about 10,000,000? \n\n      But we don't know the bounds. We'll assume the problem's n is such that the total length is within 2000000.\n\n      Alternatively, we avoid building the huge string? We can simulate the second program without building the string? \n\n      We can process each integer in b and then for each digit in the integer, we update the second program's state? \n\n      This would avoid building the huge string.\n\n      Steps for an alternative for step3 to step5:\n\n          We have the array b of n integers.\n\n          We want to simulate the string that is the concatenation of the integers.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            N_total = 0\n            do i = 1, n\n                write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                len_i = len_trim(temp_str)\n                ! Now, we want to process each character in temp_str in order? but note: the second program processes from last character to first.\n\n                ! The entire string is the concatenation: \n                !   S1 = b0_string // b1_string // ... // b_{n-1}_string\n                ! The second program processes from the last character (which is the last digit of the last integer) to the first character (which is the first digit of the first integer).\n\n                ! Therefore, we can process the array b in reverse order, and for each integer, convert to string and then process the string in reverse order.\n\n            end do\n\n          We do:\n\n            radix = 1\n            mod_arr = 0   ! but we are not storing the entire mod_arr? we only need the previous element? \n\n            However, the second program does:\n\n                if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n\n            So we need the previous element.\n\n            And we are storing the entire mod_arr? but we are processing one digit at a time. And the total number of digits is N_total.\n\n            We can store mod_arr for each digit? but the total number of digits might be huge.\n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire mod_arr if we note that we only need the previous element. So we can use a variable to store the previous value.\n\n          Revised for second program without storing the entire string and without storing the entire mod_arr:\n\n            Let:\n                prev = 0   ! for the current digit's previous state (which would be the mod_arr value for the next digit? but note the indexing: we are going from the last digit of the entire string to the first)\n\n            But note: the second program does:\n\n                for i in 0 to N-1 (digit index, from last to first in the entire string)\n\n                tmp = (digit * radix) % 2019\n                if (i>0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n\n            And then mod_arr[i] = tmp.\n\n            But then we need mod_arr[i-1] for the next digit? and we are not storing the entire array? \n\n            However, we are also counting mod_cnt[tmp] for every digit.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                total_digits = 0\n                do i = n, 1, -1   ! process the integers in reverse order? but not necessary, we can do any order as long as we go from the last character of the entire string to the first.\n\n                Instead, we can process the integers in the original order, but then the digits of each integer in reverse order? \n\n            How about:\n\n                We traverse the array b from last integer to first integer, and for each integer, we convert to string and then traverse the string from last character to first.\n\n            Example: \n                b = [10, 20] \n                entire string: \"1020\", last character is '0', then '2', then '0', then '1'\n\n                We want: \n                    i=0: digit = 0 -> tmp0 = 0*1 = 0 -> mod_arr[0]=0, mod_cnt[0]++\n                    i=1: digit = 2 -> tmp1 = (2 * 10) % 2019 = 20 -> then add mod_arr[0]? -> 20 -> mod_arr[1]=20, mod_cnt[20]++\n                    i=2: digit = 0 -> tmp2 = (0 * 100) % 2019 = 0 -> then add mod_arr[1]=20 -> 20 -> mod_arr[2]=20, mod_cnt[20]++\n                    i=3: digit = 1 -> tmp3 = (1 * 1000) % 2019 = 1000? -> then add mod_arr[2]=20 -> 1020 -> mod_arr[3]=1020, mod_cnt[1020]++\n\n            How to do without storing the entire mod_arr? We can store the value for the current digit and then use it for the next? But the next digit will need the current digit's value? \n\n            Actually, the next digit (to the left) will use the current digit's mod_arr value. So we need to store the entire array? \n\n            Alternatively, we can store the entire array in a big array? but we are already concerned about the total length.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the total length might be up to 2000000, we will allocate an array mod_arr(0:total_digits-1) if total_digits is known.\n\n          How to get total_digits? We can compute:\n\n                total_digits = 0\n                do i = 1, n\n                    write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                    total_digits = total_digits + len_trim(temp_str)\n                end do\n\n          Then allocate mod_arr(0:total_digits-1) and then fill it by:\n\n                idx = total_digits - 1   ! we are going from last digit to first, and store in mod_arr from 0 to total_digits-1\n                ! but the second program stores the last digit at mod_arr[0] and the first digit at mod_arr[total_digits-1]? \n                ! Actually, the second program does:\n\n                    i=0: last digit -> mod_arr[0]\n                    i=1: second last -> mod_arr[1]\n\n                So we can fill mod_arr in increasing order as we go from the last digit to the first.\n\n          Steps:\n\n             total_digits = 0\n             do i = 1, n\n                 write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                 total_digits = total_digits + len_trim(temp_str)\n             end do\n\n             allocate(mod_arr(0:total_digits-1))\n\n             idx = 0   ! index in mod_arr, from 0 to total_digits-1\n             radix = 1\n             mod_cnt = 0\n\n             ! We traverse the array b from n down to 1, and for each integer, traverse its string representation from last character to first.\n             do i = n, 1, -1\n                 write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                 len_i = len_trim(temp_str)\n                 do j = len_i, 1, -1\n                     digit = ichar(temp_str(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n                     tmp = digit * radix\n                     if (idx > 0) then   ! if we have a previous digit\n                         tmp = tmp + mod_arr(idx-1)\n                     end if\n                     tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n                     if (tmp < 0) then\n                         tmp = tmp + 2019\n                     end if\n                     mod_arr(idx) = tmp\n                     mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                     idx = idx + 1\n                     radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n                     if (radix < 0) radix = radix + 2019\n                 end do\n             end do\n\n          But note: the entire string is the concatenation of b(1), b(2), ... , b(n). When we traverse b from n down to 1, we are reversing the order of the integers. \n\n          Example: b = [10, 20] \n              We first process b(2)=20: \n                  string \"20\" -> last char '0', then '2'\n              Then process b(1)=10:\n                  string \"10\" -> last char '0', then '1'\n\n          Then the entire string is \"20\" then \"10\" -> so the digits are: '0','2','0','1'. But the original string was \"1020\", and we want the last digit to be '0' (from the last integer) and then the next is '2' (from the last integer), then '0' (from the first integer) and then '1' (from the first integer). \n\n          But the original string is \"1020\", so the last digit is '0', then the previous is '2', then '0', then '1'. \n\n          This matches: \n             our processing: \n                first: '0' (from b(2)=20) -> last digit of the entire string\n                then: '2' (from b(2)=20) \n                then: '0' (from b(1)=10)\n                then: '1' (from b(1)=10) -> first digit of the entire string\n\n          So the order is preserved.\n\n          However, the entire string in the first method was \"1020\", and we are processing the digits in the order: \n                position 4: '0'\n                position 3: '2'\n                position 2: '0'\n                position 1: '1'\n\n          This is the same as the first method.\n\n          Therefore, we can use this method to avoid building the huge string.\n\n          But we still need to allocate an array mod_arr of size total_digits, which might be up to 2000000. This is acceptable in modern systems.\n\n      We'll choose this method to save memory for the string? Actually, we avoid the string of 2e6 characters, but we are allocating an integer array of 2e6. The string would be 2e6 bytes, and the integer array 8e6 bytes (if integer is 4 bytes). So it's more memory, but acceptable.\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire mod_arr by noticing that we only use the previous element. So we can have:\n\n          prev = 0   ! for the previous mod_arr value\n          do ... \n             if (idx>0) then \n                 tmp = tmp + prev\n             end if\n             tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n             if (tmp<0) then ... \n             mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp)+1\n             prev = tmp   ! for the next digit\n             ...\n\n          But then we don't store the entire mod_arr. And we don need it except for the next digit.\n\n          However, note that after the first pass, we are not using mod_arr again. The only purpose of mod_arr is to pass the value to the next digit and for the frequency count. And the frequency count is done on the fly.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            total_digits = 0\n            do i = 1, n\n                write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                total_digits = total_digits + len_trim(temp_str)\n            end do\n\n            radix = 1\n            mod_cnt = 0\n            prev = 0   ! will store the mod_arr value for the previous digit (the digit to the right)\n            ! But for the first digit (the last of the string), there is no previous.\n\n            ! We'll use:\n            do i = n, 1, -1\n                write(temp_str, '(I0)') b(i)\n                len_i = len_trim(temp_str)\n                do j = len_i, 1, -1\n                    digit = ichar(temp_str(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n                    tmp = digit * radix\n                    if (total_digits_seen > 0) then   ! not the first digit\n                        tmp = tmp + prev\n                    end if\n                    tmp = mod(tmp, 2019)\n                    if (tmp < 0) then\n                        tmp = tmp + 2019\n                    end if\n                    mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n                    prev = tmp   ! for the next digit (to the left)\n                    radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n                    if (radix < 0) radix = radix + 2019\n                    total_digits_seen = total_digits_seen + 1\n                end do\n            end do\n\n          But note: the second program also does:\n\n                radix = radix * 10 % 2019\n\n          And the frequency count is for the current value of tmp.\n\n          However, the second program also does a step at the end: mod_cnt[0]++. We do that after the loop.\n\n          And the second program's algorithm is designed for contiguous substring. This alternative method should be equivalent.\n\n          Why? Because the value tmp for the digit at position i (0-indexed from the right) is the remainder of the number formed by the substring from that digit to the end. And we are counting the frequency of these remainders.\n\n          But note: the entire substring from a given digit to the end is what we are computing.\n\n          And then the answer is the sum over i of C(freq[i],2) for the frequency of remainders, and then we add one for remainder 0 (because the substring from the beginning to the end is also considered? but the program does mod_cnt[0]++ at the end).\n\n          The original program does mod_cnt[0]++ at the end to account for the entire string? or for the empty substring? \n\n          Actually, the program does:\n\n             mod_cnt[0]++   // after the loop\n\n          And the empty substring has remainder 0. \n\n          How about in our chain? We are not processing the empty substring. But the original second program does not either? Then why the mod_cnt[0]++? \n\n          The idea: \n             The original program computes the remainder for suffixes. Then it uses the fact that if two suffixes have the same remainder, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019.\n\n          The number of such substrings is the combination of the frequency.\n\n          And the empty substring is not considered? \n\n          Actually, the empty substring would be when we take the entire string? \n\n          I think the program is correct as is.\n\n          We'll do the same.\n\n          Steps:\n\n             ... after the digit processing loop ...\n\n             mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n          Then compute ans2.\n\n          And then proceed.\n\n      We'll use this more memory-efficient method.\n\n      Final Fortran program:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n\n          !

Then ans2 = 0 + (1*0/2) for all others, and then for i=0: 1*(0)/2 = 0? and then mod_cnt(0)=1 -> 1*0/2=0. Then ans2=0. That is correct.\n\n      We'll output the final program accordingly."
