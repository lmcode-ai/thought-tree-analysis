It creates two arrays: c1 and c3 (both initially \"RRL\") For c1: \n        We are going to flip up to K=1 L to R (from left to right, and stop after K flips). We traverse:\n          i=0: 'R' -> not L, so flag remains false. i=1: 'R' -> not L, flag false. i=2: 'L' -> set flag to true and flip to 'R'. Now we have done one flip (count=0 initially, but then we set flag to true). Then we break? because after flipping we break when count==K? Actually, the break condition is inside the loop: when we flip, we don't break immediately. We break only when we have done K operations?",

For the example \"RRL\": \n          Original: \n            R R L -> \n            Adjacent pairs: \n              R and R: happy -> 1\n              R and L: not happy -> 0\n            Total happiness = 1? Then the program flips: Strategy1: flip the first L we meet? so at index2: flip L to R -> becomes \"RRR\". Then happiness: \n            R-R: happy -> 1\n            R-R: happy -> 1 -> total 2? Then the program counts the happiness by: \n                S1 = \"RRR\": \n                  count=1, bef='R'\n                  i=1: same as bef -> count=2 -> then at i=2: same -> count=3 -> then at the end: we add count-1? -> 3-1 = 2? but then we break and then we also add the last segment? Actually, the happiness calculation: \n                  for i from 1 to N-1? i=1: same as bef (R) -> count=2 -> then at i=2: same -> count=3 -> then at the end (i==N-1) we add count-1 -> 3-1=2? But wait: the code for happiness:\n                    count = 1\n                    bef = first char\n                    for i=1 to N-1:\n                        if same as bef: count++ \n                        else: \n                            add count-1\n                            reset count to 1, and set bef to current\n                        at the end of the loop, if we are at the last and same, then add count-1. So \"RRR\": \n                      i=1: same -> count=2\n                      i=2: same -> count=3\n                      then at the end: we add 3-1 = 2? But also note that the first segment is not added until we break? So actually the entire string is one segment: then we add at the end: 3-1 = 2. So result1 = max(sum1, sum3) = max(2, ...) Similarly, for the other strategy: flip R to L? We start with \"RRL\". We flip the first R we meet? The code for c3: \n            flag=false\n            i=0: 'R' -> set flag=true and flip to 'L' -> becomes \"LRL\". Then we break? because we've done one flip (count=0, then when we flip we set flag=true, then we break? no, because count hasn't been incremented until we see a flip and then later see a L? Actually, the second loop for c3:\n            We look for R to flip to L? Condition: if we are in a flip (flag) and we see a L? then we reset flag and count++. But we break when count==K.\n\n          So at i=0: we see R -> set flag=true and flip to L -> now \"LRL\". Then we break? no, because count is still 0. Then at i=1: we see R (in the original it was R, but now we changed index0 to L, so the array is now \"LRL\". At i=1: we see R -> set flag=true and flip to L -> becomes \"LLL\". But wait, we have done two flips? but K=1. So we should break after the first flip? Actually, the break condition is only when count becomes K. We haven't incremented count at all? How do we increment count? We increment count when: \n            if flag is true and we see a L (for the c3 loop) -> then we reset flag and count++. But after we flip the first R to L, we set flag=true. Then at i=1: we see the next char which is R (in the original) but in the modified it is now R? but we are processing the original array? Actually, the code uses the original array for the condition? Wait: the code for c3:\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (flag && c3[i] == 'L') {   // if we are in a flip and we see L -> then we reset and count one operation? flag = false;\n                    count++;\n                }\n                if (count == K) {\n                    break;\n                } if (c3[i] == 'R') {\n                    flag = true;\n                    c3[i] = 'L';\n                }\n            }\n\n          This loop is flawed? because it flips every R to L without waiting for a consecutive sequence?",

Steps:\n\n1. Read N, K, and the string S (of length N). 2. We'll create two copies of S: c1 and c3 (as character arrays of length N). 3. Simulate the two loops for c1 and c3. For c1:\n        flag = .false. count_ops = 0\n        do i=1, N\n            if (flag .and. c1(i:i)=='R') then\n                flag = .false. count_ops = count_ops + 1\n            end if\n            if (count_ops == K) exit\n            if (c1(i:i)=='L') then\n                flag = .true. c1(i:i) = 'R'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   Similarly for c3 (with 'R' and 'L' swapped in condition? and flipping R to L).\n\n        flag = .false. count_ops = 0\n        do i=1, N\n            if (flag .and. c3(i:i)=='L') then\n                flag = .false. count_ops = count_ops + 1\n            end if\n            if (count_ops == K) exit\n            if (c3(i:i)=='R') then\n                flag = .true.\n                c3(i:i) = 'L'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   But note: the Java code for c3 breaks when count_ops becomes K.

Then at the end, if we are still in a segment, we add it at the last step? Actually, the Java code:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n            if (S1.charAt(i) == bef) {\n                count++; if (i == N - 1) {\n                    sum1 += count - 1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                bef = S1.charAt(i);\n                sum1 += count - 1;\n                count = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n   This misses the last segment if it is not the same as the previous?",

Then i runs from 0 to 1 (inclusive). i=0: \n                        5 -> not 10 -> then 5>=5 -> then check digits[1] (which is 0) -> then we do: bills+=5 -> then we do nothing else? i=1: \n                        0 -> then bills +=0? -> total bills=5.

Then since 9>5: we do:\n                        digits[i+1]++ -> digits[1] becomes 10 -> and then bills += 10-9=1. Then we go to i=1: First, check: digits[1]==10 -> so we set digits[2]++ -> digits[2]=1, and set digits[1]=0. Then we check: digits[1] is now 0 -> so we add 0? Then i=2: digits[2]=1 -> add 1? so total bills=1+1=2. But the Java code allocated only 3 elements (index0,1,2). Then at i=2: we check digits[2]=1 -> which is <5 -> so bills+=1 -> total=3? Actually, the code for the last element (i=2) is:\n\n                    if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                        bills += digits[i];   -> 1\n                    } else if ... \n\n                So total bills=1 (from i=0) + 0 (from i=1) + 1 (from i=2) = 2? But wait, at i=0: we added 1 (from 10-9). Then at i=1: we set it to 0 and then add 0? Then at i=2: we add 1 -> total=2. However, the expected answer for 99?

Then at i=2: we have 1 -> add 1? total=1 (from i=0) + 0 (from i=1) + 1 (from i=2) = 2. But why at i=0 we add 1? because 10-9=1? Actually, the code for i=0: \n                  digits[0]=9 -> then we set digits[1]++ -> then we add (10-9)=1?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (atcoder_ABC140_D) reads two integers (N, K) and a string (S). Then it does some processing and outputs an integer (the maximum of two sums, sum1 and sum3).\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string (representing a number) and outputs an integer (bills).\n\nThe third program (atcoder_AGC034_B) reads a string and outputs a long integer (cnt).\n\nBut the output of the first program is an integer, while the second program expects a string. Similarly, the output of the second is an integer, but the third expects a string.\n\nTherefore, we must convert the output of the first program (an integer) to a string to serve as input to the second program. Similarly, the output of the second program (an integer) must be converted to a string for the third.\n\nHowever, note the problem statement: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire chain would be:\n\nInput for first: two integers and a string (from stdin)\nOutput of first: integer -> becomes input of second (as a string)\nOutput of second: integer -> becomes input of third (as a string)\n\nBut wait: the first program actually reads three tokens: two integers and a string. The second and third read one string.\n\nSo the overall input to the chain is the same as the first program: two integers and a string. The overall output is the output of the third program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n1. Read the initial input: two integers (N, K) and a string (S) (as the first program does).\n2. Run the logic of the first program to produce an integer (let's call it result1). Then convert result1 to a string (this string will be the input for the second program).\n3. Run the logic of the second program on the string representation of result1 to produce an integer (result2). Then convert result2 to a string (for the third program).\n4. Run the logic of the third program on the string representation of result2 to produce a long integer (result3), which is the final output.\n\nHowever, note that the second program expects a string of digits. The first program outputs an integer that we must convert to a string of digits. Similarly, the third program expects a string, and we will convert the integer output of the second to a string.\n\nBut wait: the third program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts the number of times it can form \"AD\" (by having an A followed by a D). The input to the third program is a string that is the string representation of an integer (from the second program). This string will only contain digits? Then note that the digits are from 0 to 9, so there will be no letters? Actually, the third program was originally designed for a string of letters (like \"ABCBA\") but we are feeding it a string of digits.\n\nThis seems to break the third program? But note: the problem says that the entire sequence of programs is to be executed. The original sequence is:\n\nProgram1: reads (N, K, S) -> outputs an integer (say X)\nProgram2: reads the string representation of X -> outputs an integer (say Y)\nProgram3: reads the string representation of Y -> outputs a long integer (say Z)\n\nSo we are not changing the data. The third program will process a string of digits. In the third program, it replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". In a string of digits, \"BC\" will never occur. So the replacement does nothing. Then it counts sequences of 'A' followed by 'D'. In a string of digits, there are no 'A' and no 'D'. Therefore, the count will be zero? That doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nBut wait: let me reexamine the chain. The first program is from a problem about flipping characters to maximize happiness. The second is about minimizing the number of bills for a payment. The third is about counting the number of \"ABC\" patterns? \n\nIt seems that these three programs are independent and not meant to be chained? The problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut the inputs and outputs do not match in content. The first program outputs an integer that is the maximum happiness (a number) and the second program expects a string that is a number (so converting the integer to string is fine). The second program outputs the number of bills (an integer) and the third program expects a string. But the third program is designed to process a string of 'A','B','C'. However, the output of the second program is a string of digits. This will cause the third program to output 0 because there are no 'A' or 'D' (which is the replacement for \"BC\") in the digits.\n\nThis suggests that the chain might be a mistake? But the problem states that they are to be executed in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example programs are not intended to be chained by their output content? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we must follow the instructions:\n\nWe are to write a Fortran program that:\n- Reads the initial input (N, K, S) as the first program.\n- Then does the processing of the first program to get an integer (result1).\n- Then uses that integer (converted to a string) as input to the second program's logic to get an integer (result2).\n- Then uses that integer (converted to a string) as input to the third program's logic to get a long integer (result3).\n- Then outputs result3.\n\nSo regardless of whether the third program makes sense on a string of digits, we are to do exactly that.\n\nBut note: the third program writes a long integer. The problem says the entire chain must behave identically.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program structure:\n\n1. Read N, K, and a string S (with length N).\n2. Process S as in the first program to compute two candidate strings (S1 and S3) and then compute two sums (sum1 and sum3) and then take the maximum (result1).\n3. Convert result1 to a string (say str1).\n4. Process str1 as in the second program to compute the bills (result2). Note: the second program reverses the string? Actually, it reverses the string to get the digits in reverse order (least significant first). But our result1 is an integer. We must convert result1 to a string and then reverse it? Actually, the second program does:\n   - It takes the input string (say `number`), then for each index i from 0 to len-1, it sets:\n        digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n   This is converting the string to an array of digits in reverse order (so the first element of `digits` is the least significant digit). Then it processes the digits array.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the reversal by processing the string from least significant digit (rightmost) to most significant (leftmost). But note: the program also uses an extra digit at the end (for carry). We can simulate without actually reversing by processing from the end.\n\n   However, to be faithful, we can represent the digits in reverse order.\n\n5. Convert result2 to a string (str2).\n6. Process str2 as in the third program: replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\", then traverse and count the sequences of consecutive 'A's that are followed by a 'D'. But note: in the third program, the string after replacement is then traversed to count:\n        tmp = 0\n        for each char in the string:\n            if char == 'A': tmp++\n            if char == 'D': cnt += tmp   [because every A that has been accumulated can form an AD with this D]\n            else (if it's anything else, including 'B' or 'C' that weren't replaced? but note we replaced BC to D, so there should be no BC left, but there might be other letters? but our string is digits, so we don't have 'B' or 'C') then we reset tmp to 0.\n\n   Since str2 is a string of digits, there will be no 'A' and no 'D'. Therefore, the count will be 0.\n\n   But wait: the third program originally expects a string that may contain A, B, C. We are giving it a string of digits. So the behavior is well defined: the count is 0.\n\n7. Output the result of the third program (which is 0?).\n\nThis seems odd, but that's what the chain would do.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the example:\n\nFirst program: \nInput: \n   N, K, S (a string of L and R)\nOutput: an integer (max happiness)\n\nFor example, if we run the first program with:\n   N=3, K=1, S=\"RRL\"\nHow does it work?\n   It creates two arrays: c1 and c3 (both initially \"RRL\")\n   For c1: \n        We are going to flip up to K=1 L to R (from left to right, and stop after K flips).\n        We traverse:\n          i=0: 'R' -> not L, so flag remains false.\n          i=1: 'R' -> not L, flag false.\n          i=2: 'L' -> set flag to true and flip to 'R'. Now we have done one flip (count=0 initially, but then we set flag to true).\n        Then we break? because after flipping we break when count==K? Actually, the break condition is inside the loop: when we flip, we don't break immediately. We break only when we have done K operations? Actually, the break condition is when count (the number of operations) equals K.\n\n        How does the count increment?\n        In the first loop for c1:\n          We start with flag=false.\n          i=0: 'R' -> if flag is true and we see 'R', then we set flag to false and count++ -> but flag is false so skip. Then if we see 'L', set flag=true and flip to 'R'. Then we break? because we set count to 0 and then we break? Actually, the break condition is after the if (flag and c1[i]=='R') block and after the flip block. But note: we do the flip and then we break? No, because we break only when count becomes K. In the flip we set flag=true and then we move to next. Then we break? No, because count is still 0.\n\n        Actually, the logic for the first loop (for c1) is:\n          We are looking for consecutive pairs: ... L followed by R ...? \n\n        The program is solving: We can flip at most K segments of consecutive L's to R's? But the code is a bit tricky.\n\n        Actually, the problem is: we have people seated in a row, facing left or right. Happiness is when a person sees the person in front of them? The original problem from ABC140_D.\n\n        After reading, I recall: the happiness is defined as: if a person at i is facing right and the next person (i+1) is also facing right, then they are happy? Similarly for left? Actually, the problem counts the number of adjacent pairs that are facing the same direction.\n\n        The program does two strategies: one is to flip L to R (from left until we have done K operations) and the other is to flip R to L? and then takes the maximum happiness.\n\n        For the example \"RRL\": \n          Original: \n            R R L -> \n            Adjacent pairs: \n              R and R: happy -> 1\n              R and L: not happy -> 0\n            Total happiness = 1? Then the program flips:\n\n          Strategy1: flip the first L we meet? so at index2: flip L to R -> becomes \"RRR\". Then happiness: \n            R-R: happy -> 1\n            R-R: happy -> 1 -> total 2? Then the program counts the happiness by: \n                S1 = \"RRR\": \n                  count=1, bef='R'\n                  i=1: same as bef -> count=2 -> then at i=2: same -> count=3 -> then at the end: we add count-1? -> 3-1 = 2? but then we break and then we also add the last segment? Actually, the happiness calculation: \n                  for i from 1 to N-1? \n                    i=1: same as bef (R) -> count=2 -> then at i=2: same -> count=3 -> then at the end (i==N-1) we add count-1 -> 3-1=2? \n                  But wait: the code for happiness:\n                    count = 1\n                    bef = first char\n                    for i=1 to N-1:\n                        if same as bef: count++ \n                        else: \n                            add count-1\n                            reset count to 1, and set bef to current\n                        at the end of the loop, if we are at the last and same, then add count-1.\n\n                  So \"RRR\": \n                      i=1: same -> count=2\n                      i=2: same -> count=3\n                      then at the end: we add 3-1 = 2? \n                  But also note that the first segment is not added until we break? So actually the entire string is one segment: then we add at the end: 3-1 = 2.\n\n          So result1 = max(sum1, sum3) = max(2, ...) \n\n          Similarly, for the other strategy: flip R to L? \n          We start with \"RRL\". We flip the first R we meet? \n          The code for c3: \n            flag=false\n            i=0: 'R' -> set flag=true and flip to 'L' -> becomes \"LRL\". Then we break? because we've done one flip (count=0, then when we flip we set flag=true, then we break? no, because count hasn't been incremented until we see a flip and then later see a L? \n\n          Actually, the second loop for c3:\n            We look for R to flip to L? \n            Condition: if we are in a flip (flag) and we see a L? then we reset flag and count++. But we break when count==K.\n\n          So at i=0: we see R -> set flag=true and flip to L -> now \"LRL\". Then we break? no, because count is still 0. Then at i=1: we see R (in the original it was R, but now we changed index0 to L, so the array is now \"LRL\". At i=1: we see R -> set flag=true and flip to L -> becomes \"LLL\". But wait, we have done two flips? but K=1. So we should break after the first flip? \n\n          Actually, the break condition is only when count becomes K. We haven't incremented count at all? \n\n          How do we increment count? \n          We increment count when: \n            if flag is true and we see a L (for the c3 loop) -> then we reset flag and count++.\n\n          But after we flip the first R to L, we set flag=true. Then at i=1: we see the next char which is R (in the original) but in the modified it is now R? but we are processing the original array? Actually, the code uses the original array for the condition? \n\n          Wait: the code for c3:\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (flag && c3[i] == 'L') {   // if we are in a flip and we see L -> then we reset and count one operation? \n                    flag = false;\n                    count++;\n                }\n                if (count == K) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                if (c3[i] == 'R') {\n                    flag = true;\n                    c3[i] = 'L';\n                }\n            }\n\n          This loop is flawed? because it flips every R to L without waiting for a consecutive sequence? \n\n          Actually, the problem might be: the program is trying to flip contiguous segments? But the code doesn't seem to do that.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem is to translate the chain, we will just implement the same logic in Fortran.\n\n        For the example \"RRL\", K=1:\n          c1 becomes: flip the first L to R -> \"RRR\", so S1=\"RRR\", then the happiness for S1: \n            We traverse: \n              count=1, bef='R'\n              i=1: same -> count=2\n              i=2: same -> count=3 -> then at the end we add 3-1 = 2 -> sum1=2.\n          For c3: \n            i=0: c3[0]=='R' -> set flag=true and flip to L -> now \"LRL\"\n            then we don't break because count is still 0 and we haven't incremented count? Then i=1: \n                now c3[1] is 'R' (because the original S was \"RRL\", and we only changed the first one? but the array c3 is being modified: \n                at i=0: we set c3[0] to 'L'. Then at i=1: the char is the original 'R'? so we set flag=true (again) and flip to L -> now \"LLL\"\n            Then i=2: \n                we see c3[2]=='L'. Now, flag is true (from the last flip) and we see L -> so we set flag=false and count++ -> now count=1 -> then we break because count==K.\n\n            Then S3=\"LLL\". The happiness: \n              count=1, bef='L'\n              i=1: same -> count=2\n              i=2: same -> count=3 -> add 3-1=2 -> sum3=2.\n\n          Then result1 = max(2,2)=2.\n\n        Then the second program: input is the string \"2\" (because we output 2 from the first program).\n\n        The second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) for input \"2\":\n          We create an array `digits` of length 2 (the string length) plus one for the next carry? so digits[0] = 2 (if the string is \"2\", then reversed: we get a digit array of [2]? but then we have an extra element at index 1?).\n\n          Steps:\n            i=0: \n                digits[0]=2 -> \n                if 2<5 -> bills +=2 -> bills=2.\n            Then we don't do anything else? \n          Output: 2.\n\n        Then the third program: input is the string \"2\"\n          Replace \"BC\" with \"D\": nothing changes -> string is \"2\"\n          Then traverse:\n            tmp=0\n            for each char in \"2\":\n                if char=='A'? no. if char=='D'? no. else: set tmp=0.\n            So cnt=0.\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n        Therefore, for the input (3,1,\"RRL\"), the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n        But note: the first program in isolation would output 2. The second in isolation on \"2\" would output 2. The third in isolation on \"2\" would output 0.\n\n        So the chain is 0.\n\n        We must write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nSteps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, K, and a string S (of length N). We assume the input format: first integer N, then integer K, then a string (without spaces) of length N.\n\n2. Process S to compute two modified strings (as in the first program) and then compute the happiness for each to get result1 = max(sum1, sum3).\n\n   We'll have to simulate the two loops for c1 and c3.\n\n   Note: In Fortran, we can represent strings as character arrays. We can use `character(len=:), allocatable :: S` but we know the length N.\n\n   We'll declare:\n        integer :: N, K\n        character(len=1000000) :: S   ! assuming maximum length, but we can use allocatable or read the actual length.\n        read*, N, K\n        read*, S   ! but note: we only want the first N characters.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n        character(len=N) :: S   ! but we don't know N at compile time. So we can do:\n\n        We can read N and K, then read a string and take the first N characters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        integer :: N, K\n        character(1000000) :: tempS\n        read*, N, K\n        read*, tempS\n        ! then we take a substring of length N: S = tempS(1:N)\n\n   But note: the input string might be exactly of length N.\n\n3. Convert the integer result1 to a string. We can write the integer to a character variable.\n\n4. Process the string (from result1) as the second program: reverse it to get the digits from least significant to most, then process the digits with the algorithm.\n\n   We have to account for a possible carry beyond the last digit? The second program uses an array of length (len+1) so we have an extra digit at the end (for the carry). We'll do the same.\n\n5. Then convert the result2 (an integer) to a string.\n\n6. Process the string (from result2) as the third program: replace every occurrence of \"BC\" by \"D\", then traverse and count the number of times we have an 'A' followed by a 'D'? Actually, the algorithm is: \n        cnt = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        for each character in the string:\n            if char == 'A': tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if char == 'D': cnt = cnt + tmp\n            else: tmp = 0\n\n   But note: the original program replaces \"BC\" by \"D\". We must do that first.\n\n7. Output the final cnt.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- We must be cautious about the string lengths: the first program's output (result1) is an integer that might be large? The maximum happiness: the original happiness is at most N-1 (if all are same). And we flip at most K (which is up to N). So the maximum happiness is N-1. Then result1 is at most N-1, which is up to 10^5? (if N=10^5). Then the string representation of result1 has at most 6 digits? So the second program will run on a string of up to 6 digits.\n\n- The second program: the input string is the string representation of an integer (without leading zeros). We reverse it and then process.\n\n- The third program: the input string is the string representation of an integer (without leading zeros). Then we replace \"BC\" by \"D\" (which won't change anything because it's digits) and then run the counting.\n\nGiven the above, we write the Fortran program.\n\nNote: Fortran does not have dynamic arrays in the same way, but we know the maximum length for the digits (say 20 digits for the first integer, and 20 for the second) so we can use fixed arrays.\n\nBut to be safe, we can use:\n\n  For the first program: the string S is up to 1000000 characters? We can set a maximum.\n\nLet me set:\n\n  integer, parameter :: maxn = 1000000   ! maximum for N\n\nBut the problem says: the first program reads N and K and a string of length N.\n\nWe'll assume N is up to 1000000.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read N, K, and the string S (of length N).\n\n2. We'll create two copies of S: c1 and c3 (as character arrays of length N).\n\n3. Simulate the two loops for c1 and c3.\n\n   For c1:\n        flag = .false.\n        count_ops = 0\n        do i=1, N\n            if (flag .and. c1(i:i)=='R') then\n                flag = .false.\n                count_ops = count_ops + 1\n            end if\n            if (count_ops == K) exit\n            if (c1(i:i)=='L') then\n                flag = .true.\n                c1(i:i) = 'R'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   Similarly for c3 (with 'R' and 'L' swapped in condition? and flipping R to L).\n\n        flag = .false.\n        count_ops = 0\n        do i=1, N\n            if (flag .and. c3(i:i)=='L') then\n                flag = .false.\n                count_ops = count_ops + 1\n            end if\n            if (count_ops == K) exit\n            if (c3(i:i)=='R') then\n                flag = .true.\n                c3(i:i) = 'L'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n   But note: the Java code for c3 breaks when count_ops becomes K. And we break out of the loop.\n\n4. Then we compute the happiness for c1 and c3.\n\n   For a string T (either c1 or c3), we do:\n\n        count_seg = 1\n        sum_val = 0\n        bef = T(1:1)\n        do i=2, N\n            if (T(i:i) == bef) then\n                count_seg = count_seg + 1\n            else\n                sum_val = sum_val + (count_seg - 1)\n                count_seg = 1\n                bef = T(i:i)\n            end if\n        end do\n        sum_val = sum_val + (count_seg - 1)   ! because we have the last segment\n\n   Actually, the Java code does:\n\n        if (i == N-1) {\n            if (same) then add count-1 at the last step? \n        }\n\n   But in the else branch, it adds the previous segment. Then at the end, if we are still in a segment, we add it at the last step? \n\n   Actually, the Java code:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n            if (S1.charAt(i) == bef) {\n                count++;\n                if (i == N - 1) {\n                    sum1 += count - 1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                bef = S1.charAt(i);\n                sum1 += count - 1;\n                count = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n   This misses the last segment if it is not the same as the previous? Actually, no: when we break the segment, we add the previous segment (which is the one that ended at i-1). Then we start a new segment at i. Then at the end, we have to add the last segment? But the loop ends at i = N-1. The last segment is from the last break to the end? and we add it only when we are in the same branch and at the last index? \n\n   So we can do as above: after the loop, we add the last segment: count_seg-1.\n\n   But note: the entire string might be one segment? Then we never enter the else branch. Then we have to add at the end? So we do:\n\n        ... after the loop, we add: sum_val = sum_val + (count_seg - 1)\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Then result1 = max(sum1, sum3)\n\n5. Convert result1 to a string. We can write:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        write(str1, *) result1\n        ! But this will have leading spaces? We can adjust by removing spaces.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n        write(str1, '(I0)') result1   ! I0 means integer with no leading spaces.\n\n   But note: the second program expects the string without any spaces.\n\n6. Process str1 in the second program:\n\n        We need to reverse the string? and then convert each character to digit.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let L = len_trim(str1)   ! the length without trailing spaces? but we have no leading spaces? Actually, the I0 format gives no leading spaces.\n\n        We create an integer array `digits` of size 0:L (index from 0 to L, but we have L digits, and we need an extra for carry? so we make it 0:L (so size L+1)).\n\n        We set:\n\n          do i=1, L\n             j = L - i + 1   ! because we want the last character of str1 to be the first in the reversed array? \n             digits(i-1) = ichar(str1(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n          end do\n\n        Then we set digits(L) = 0   ! for the next carry? Actually, the Java code creates an array of length (number.length()+1), so we have an index from 0 to L (so L+1 elements). The last element (index L) is initially 0.\n\n        Then we set:\n\n          bills = 0\n          do i=0, L-1   ! but note: in the Java code, the loop goes to i<=number.length() -> i from 0 to L (inclusive). But note: the array has L+1 elements (index 0 to L). We process i from 0 to L.\n\n          Actually, the Java code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n          So we do i from 0 to L (inclusive).\n\n          Steps:\n\n            if (digits(i)==10) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                digits(i) = 0\n            end if\n\n            if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                bills = bills + digits(i)\n            else if (digits(i)==5) then\n                if (digits(i+1)>=5) then   ! note: i+1 might be beyond our array? but we have an extra element at index L (which we set to 0) and then beyond that? The array is of size L+1 (index 0 to L). When i=L, then i+1 = L+1 -> but we don't have that? \n\n                Actually, in Java, the array is of length L+1 (so index 0 to L). Then when i = L, then digits[i+1] would be beyond the array? \n\n                Looking at the Java code: they created `digits` of length (number.length()+1), and then in the loop i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). But when i = number.length(), then digits[i] is the last element (which we set to 0 initially) and then digits[i+1] is out of bounds? \n\n                Actually, the Java code:\n\n                    int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\n                Then the indices: 0 to number.length() (so inclusive). Then the loop runs i from 0 to number.length() (so the last index is number.length()).\n\n                But then when i = number.length(), we access digits[i+1] -> that would be index number.length()+1, which is out of bounds.\n\n                This is a bug in the Java code? \n\n                However, note the condition: if (digits[i] == 10) -> then we set digits[i+1]++. But if i is the last index, then we set an index beyond the array? \n\n                We must fix: we allocated the array with one extra element? Actually, the Java code only allocates one extra element. Then we must have the array of length L+2? \n\n                But the problem says: translate the entire sequence. We must do the same as the Java code? \n\n                However, the Java code might run without error because the array is of length L+1, and we are accessing index L+1 (which is out of bounds) -> undefined behavior.\n\n                We must avoid that. How did the Java code avoid that? It sets:\n\n                    for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                        digits[i] = ... \n                    }\n\n                Then the last element (index L) is not set? It remains 0? Then the loop runs i=0 to L (inclusive) because number.length() is L, so the condition is i<=L.\n\n                Then when i=L, we access digits[L+1] -> which is beyond the array.\n\n                This is a bug. But note: the condition `if (digits[i]==10)` might not occur at the last element? because we set the last element to 0? and then we never set it to 10? \n\n                Actually, we might have a carry that propagates? \n\n                How to fix? We can allocate the array to L+2 and set the last two to 0.\n\n                Since we are translating, we'll do:\n\n                    allocate digits(0:L+1)   ! indices from 0 to L+1, so we have L+2 elements? but we only need L+1? Actually, the Java code allocates L+1 elements (index0 to indexL). Then we are accessing index L+1 in the last iteration? which is out of bounds.\n\n                Alternatively, we can make the array from 0 to L+1 (so size L+2) and set the last two to 0.\n\n                But the problem says: behave identically. The Java code has a bug? \n\n                Let me test the Java code with a small input: \"5\" -> then the array length is 2: digits[0]=5, digits[1]=0? Then i runs from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n                    i=0: \n                        5 -> not 10 -> then 5>=5 -> then check digits[1] (which is 0) -> then we do: bills+=5 -> then we do nothing else? \n                    i=1: \n                        0 -> then bills +=0? -> total bills=5.\n\n                But if we have \"9\", then:\n                    digits[0]=9 -> then 9>5 -> we set digits[1]++ -> then digits[1] becomes 1, and bills += 10-9=1 -> then i=1: digits[1]=1 -> then we add 1 -> total bills=2.\n\n                Now, if we have a number that causes a carry at the last digit? for example, \"99\": \n                    digits = [9,9,0] (if we allocated 3 elements? but the Java code allocated 3? because number.length()=2 -> so 3 elements: index0,1,2). Then:\n\n                    i=0: \n                        9 -> then digits[1]++ -> becomes 10 -> then we set digits[0]=0? no, we don't set to 0? Actually, the condition for 10 is at the top? \n\n                    Actually, the code:\n\n                        if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                            digits[i+1]++;\n                            digits[i] = 0;\n                        }\n\n                    Then at i=0: digits[0]=9 -> skip the 10 condition. Then since 9>5: we do:\n                        digits[i+1]++ -> digits[1] becomes 10 -> and then bills += 10-9=1.\n\n                    Then we go to i=1: \n                        First, check: digits[1]==10 -> so we set digits[2]++ -> digits[2]=1, and set digits[1]=0.\n                        Then we check: digits[1] is now 0 -> so we add 0? \n                    Then i=2: digits[2]=1 -> add 1? so total bills=1+1=2.\n\n                But the Java code allocated only 3 elements (index0,1,2). Then at i=2: we check digits[2]=1 -> which is <5 -> so bills+=1 -> total=3? \n\n                Actually, the code for the last element (i=2) is:\n\n                    if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                        bills += digits[i];   -> 1\n                    } else if ... \n\n                So total bills=1 (from i=0) + 0 (from i=1) + 1 (from i=2) = 2? \n\n                But wait, at i=0: we added 1 (from 10-9). Then at i=1: we set it to 0 and then add 0? Then at i=2: we add 1 -> total=2.\n\n                However, the expected answer for 99? \n\n                The problem of the second program: minimizing the number of bills. The bills are of denominations 1, 10, 100, ... and you can give and receive change. \n\n                Actually, the problem is: we want to pay the amount exactly using a minimal total number of bills (and we can use bills of 1,10,100,... and the shopkeeper can give change also in bills of 1,10,100,...). \n\n                99: \n                  One way: give 100 and get 1 back -> total bills: 1 (for 100) + 1 (for the change 1) = 2? \n                So the answer is 2.\n\n                Therefore, the Java code works for \"99\". But note: when we did digits[1] became 10, then we set digits[1]=0 and digits[2]++. Then at i=1 we then process 0: which is <5 -> add 0? Then at i=2: we have 1 -> add 1? total=1 (from i=0) + 0 (from i=1) + 1 (from i=2) = 2.\n\n                But why at i=0 we add 1? because 10-9=1? \n\n                Actually, the code for i=0: \n                  digits[0]=9 -> then we set digits[1]++ -> then we add (10-9)=1? \n\n                Then the code for i=1: \n                  now digits[1] becomes 10 -> so we set digits[2]++ and set digits[1]=0 -> then we process the 0: which is <5 -> so add 0.\n\n                Then i=2: digits[2]=1 -> add 1.\n\n                So total 2.\n\n                Now, if the carry propagates beyond the allocated array? For example, \"999...9\" (with L=20). Then at i=L, we set digits[L+1]++. But the array was allocated of size L+1? so the last index is L. Then we are accessing digits[L+1] which is out of bounds.\n\n                This is a bug. We must allocate the array to size L+2 to avoid this? \n\n                But the problem says: the Java program does not crash? It might crash or have undefined behavior.\n\n                Since we are in Fortran, we can allocate the array from 0 to L+1 (so size L+2) and initialize to 0.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let L = len_trim(str1)\n                  integer, dimension(0:L+1) :: digits   ! indices 0 to L+1\n                  digits = 0   ! initialize to zero\n\n                  do i=0, L-1\n                     j = L - i   ! because the string: the first character is the most significant? so we reverse: \n                     ! Example: \"123\" -> we want digits[0]=3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1? \n                     ! But the Java code: \n                     !   for (int i=0; i<number.length(); i++) {\n                     !       digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length()-1-i) - '0';\n                     !   }\n                     ! So for \"123\" (length=3): \n                     !   i=0: char at index 2 -> '3'\n                     !   i=1: char at index 1 -> '2'\n                     !   i=2: char at index 0 -> '1'\n                     ! Then we have digits = [3,2,1]? \n\n                     ! In Fortran, we have str1(1:1) is the first character? \n                     ! We want the last character: str1(L:L) for the first digit? \n                     digits(i) = ichar(str1(L-i:L-i)) - ichar('0')\n                  end do\n\n                Then we process i from 0 to L (inclusive) in the main loop:\n\n                  bills = 0\n                  do i=0, L   ! we allocated 0 to L+1, so we can safely access i+1 for i in [0,L] (because i+1<=L+1)\n                    if (digits(i)==10) then\n                        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                        digits(i) = 0\n                    end if\n\n                    if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                        bills = bills + digits(i)\n                    else if (digits(i)==5) then\n                        if (digits(i+1)>=5) then\n                            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                        end if\n                        bills = bills + 5\n                    else\n                        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n                    end if\n                  end do\n\n                But note: the condition for 5: we don't reset digits(i) to 0? In the 10 case we set to 0. But for 5 we leave it? Then in the next iteration, we might see 5 again? But we are processing each digit only once.\n\n                Actually, we process each i only once.\n\n7. Then we have the bills for the second program.\n\n8. Convert bills to a string: str2.\n\n        character(len=20) :: str2\n        write(str2, '(I0)') bills\n\n9. Process str2 for the third program:\n\n        Replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". Since str2 is digits, we skip this step? But we do:\n\n        We can create a new string by replacing? But note: the string is small (at most 20 digits). We can do:\n\n          temp_str = str2\n          ! But we know there's no 'B' or 'C'? so we skip? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do the replacement:\n\n          i = 1\n          do while (i <= len_trim(temp_str)-1)\n             if (temp_str(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                 temp_str(i:i+1) = \"D \"\n                 ! but we want to replace two characters by one? Then we have to shift? \n                 ! Actually, the Java code does: s.replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\") -> so every \"BC\" becomes \"D\", and the string becomes shorter? \n\n          We cannot easily do in-place with shifting? We can create a new string.\n\n          Steps:\n\n             new_str = ''\n             i=1\n             do while (i<=len_trim(temp_str))\n                 if (i<len_trim(temp_str) .and. temp_str(i:i+1)==\"BC\") then\n                     new_str = trim(new_str) // 'D'\n                     i = i+2\n                 else\n                     new_str = trim(new_str) // temp_str(i:i)\n                     i = i+1\n                 end if\n             end do\n\n        But note: the string is small, so we can do.\n\n        However, we know the string is digits, so we can skip? But to be faithful, we do the replacement.\n\n        But then we run the counting:\n\n          cnt = 0\n          tmp = 0\n          do i=1, len_trim(new_str)\n             if (new_str(i:i)=='A') then\n                 tmp = tmp + 1\n             else if (new_str(i:i)=='D') then\n                 cnt = cnt + tmp\n             else\n                 tmp = 0\n             end if\n          end do\n\n10. Output cnt.\n\nBut note: the third program outputs a long integer? In Fortran, we use integer(kind=8) for cnt? But the counts in the third program are not huge? The string is at most 20 characters? So cnt will be at most 20.\n\nWe'll use integer for cnt.\n\nHowever, the Java program used long for cnt.\n\nWe'll use integer(kind=8) for cnt? Or just integer? The problem says \"long\" in Java. But the numbers are small.\n\nBut to be safe, we can use integer(kind=8) for cnt.\n\nBut note: the third program's input is the string representation of the output of the second program (which is an integer). The second program's output is the number of bills, which for a number with L digits is at most 9*(L+1) (because we do at most 9 per digit and then the carry might add one more digit). So for L=20, the bills is at most 9*21 = 189? Then the string for the third program is at most 3 digits? So the counting loop is very small.\n\nTherefore, we can use integer.\n\nBut let's use integer(kind=8) to match the Java long.\n\nNow, we code accordingly.\n\nWe'll assume:\n\n  integer, parameter :: maxn = 1000000   ! for the first string\n  character(len=maxn) :: tempS\n  integer :: N, K\n  integer :: result1, sum1, sum3, bills\n  integer(kind=8) :: cnt   ! for the third program\n\nBut note: the first program's result1 might be as large as N (up to 10^6) so we need to convert an integer up to 10^6 to a string (7 digits).\n\nWe'll write the entire program.\n\nNote: Fortran has issues with reading: we read N and K, then we read the string. We assume the string is the next token.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nImportant: We must not do any I/O in the middle.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  program chain\n  implicit none\n\n  !

Output the result of the third program\n  print *, cnt\n\n  end program chain\n\nBut note: the third program in Java had a class and a solver method. We only need the logic.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the variable `flag` is a logical. We used `flag` in two separate loops. We did not reset it? Actually, we did reset before each loop.\n\nBut in the first loop for c1, we set:\n\n      flag = .false.\n\nSimilarly for c3.\n\nAlso, we used the same variable `flag` for both loops? That's fine.\n\nBut note: we used the same `count_ops` for both loops? We reset it to 0 before the second loop.\n\nSimilarly, for the happiness calculation, we reset `count_seg` and `bef` and `sum_val` appropriately.\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet me test with the example: N=3, K=1, S=\"RRL\"\n\n  result1 = 2\n  str1 = \"2\"\n\n  Then second program: \n      L=1\n      digits(0)=2, digits(1)=0 (and beyond we have 0)\n      i=0: \n          2<5 -> bills=2.\n      Then str2=\"2\"\n\n  Third program: \n      temp_str=\"2\"\n      new_str=\"2\"\n      Then traverse: \n          i=1: char '2' -> not 'A' and not 'D', so tmp_cnt=0.\n      cnt=0.\n\n  Output: 0.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut note: the second program might have an issue for numbers that cause carry beyond the allocated array? We allocated to L+1 (index0 to L+1) and we process i from 0 to L. The maximum index we write is i+1 = L+1 (which is allocated). So it's safe.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nNote: The initial string S is read from input. We assume it has no spaces? And we read it as a single token.\n\nWe use:\n\n  read(*,*) N, K\n  read(*,*) tempS   ! this reads the next token (which is the string of length N) but we only take the first N characters.\n\nBut if the string has spaces, then the read(*,*) will stop at the first space? \n\nThe problem says: the first program reads a string S. The example \"RRL\" has no space.\n\nWe assume the input string has no spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the string with format:\n\n  read(*,'(a)') tempS\n\nBut then it would read the entire line? but after N and K there is a newline? \n\nWe did two reads: first read N and K, then the next read the string.\n\nWe'll assume the input is formatted as:\n\n  3 1\n  RRL\n\nSo the second read reads the next nonblank line? and then we take the first N characters.\n\nBut the string might be exactly of length N? \n\nWe do: S = tempS(1:N)\n\nBut if the string we read is shorter than N? then we pad with spaces? But the original program reads a string of length N. We'll assume the input has at least N characters.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the string with:\n\n  read(*,'(a)') tempS\n  S = tempS(1:N)\n\nBut if the line has more than N characters, we only take the first N.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  read(*,*) N, K\n  read(*,'(a)') tempS   ! read the entire line\n\nBut then if the string has trailing spaces, they are included? But the original program uses next() which gives the next token (without spaces). \n\nWe are not sure. But the problem says the input is a string of length N.\n\nSo we'll read the next N characters.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the next token? but the string might not have spaces? \n\nTo be safe, we do:\n\n  read(*,*) N, K\n  read(*,*) tempS   ! reads the next token (which is the string of length N)\n\nBut if the string has spaces, it would only read the first word.\n\nGiven the problem, it's a string of L and R, no spaces.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  read(*,*) N, K\n  read(*,*) tempS\n\n  S = tempS(1:N)\n\nBut note: the variable tempS is declared as character(len=1000000). If the input string is shorter than N? then we are taking 1:N, which might be beyond the actual data? \n\nWe assume the input string has at least N characters.\n\nNow, we write the entire code.\n\nNote: We must declare all variables.\n\nLet me write the full code.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  program chain\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, K, i, count_ops, sum1, sum3, result1, bills, count_seg, L, j, new_len, pos\n  character(len=1000000) :: tempS\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: S, c1, c3, new_str, temp_str\n  character :: bef\n  character(len=20) :: str1, str2\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n  logical :: flag\n  integer(kind=8) :: cnt, tmp_cnt\n\n  !

Actually, we are building new_str by appending, so we want to remove trailing spaces from the current new_str? But new_str is initially empty (''), which has no spaces? \n\nWe can avoid trim by using:\n\n  new_str = new_str // ... \n\nBut we defined new_str as an allocatable string. We can do:\n\n  new_str = ''\n\n  then \n\n  new_str = new_str // ... \n\nBut then the length increases? \n\nWe can do:\n\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: new_str\n\n  new_str = ''   ! zero length\n\n  then when we add a character, we do:\n\n      new_str = new_str // char_string\n\n  where char_string is a string of one character or one character string.\n\nBut this will reallocate many times? but the string is small.\n\nAlternatively, we can preallocate to the length of temp_str (since the replacement of \"BC\" by \"D\" will only make it shorter).\n\nBut for simplicity, we do the reallocation.\n\nBut note: the string temp_str is the string representation of bills, which is at most 20 characters? So it's fine.\n\nWe'll leave as above.\n\nThis should be the complete Fortran program."
