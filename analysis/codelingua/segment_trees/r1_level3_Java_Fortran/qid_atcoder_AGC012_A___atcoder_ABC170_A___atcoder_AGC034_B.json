For each token in tokens:\n            result += 1 -> becomes 1.\n            if the token is \"0\", break the loop -> so if res1==0, we break and output 1.\n            else, we continue to the next token? but there is none -> so we break the loop naturally. So in either case, result2 = 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can just set result2 = 1.",

But note: the array is of integers. We can use the built-in `minval` and `maxval`? No.\n\n   We'll use the `quicksort` as above. However, the above partitioning might be flawed. Let me test:\n\n        We choose a pivot (the middle element). Then we move i from left until we find an element >= pivot, and j from right until we find an element <= pivot. Then swap and continue until i>=j. Then we partition at j? Actually, we break when i>=j, then we sort [first, j] and [j+1, last]? But I recall: the standard Hoare partition returns j as the split. So we do: call quicksort(arr, first, j)\n        call quicksort(arr, j+1, last) This should be correct. However, we must be cautious for the base case. Alternatively, we can use the `sort` from the Fortran standard library? There isn't one. We'll proceed with the quicksort. But note: worst-case stack depth? The worst-case is O(n) which for 30000 might be too deep? We can use an iterative version? But the problem doesn't specify constraints. And n is 10000 -> 30000 elements. Worst-case recursion depth is about 30,000? That might be too deep. We can use an iterative quicksort with a stack? But that is complicated.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The plan:\n 1. The entire sequence: The output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n 2. Only the first block (from the first Java program) reads input.\n 3. Only the last block (from the third Java program) produces output.\n 4. Intermediate steps: no I/O.\n\n Let's analyze each program:\n\n Program 1 (atcoder_AGC012_A):\n   - Reads an integer `n`.\n   - Reads an array of `3*n` integers.\n   - Sorts the array.\n   - Then, it takes the second largest, fourth largest, ... (every other starting from the second last) from the sorted array (in descending order) and sums them.\n   - Specifically: \n        head = 3*n - 2 (index starting at 0)\n        then for i=0 to n-1: \n            res += array[head]; head -= 2;\n\n   Example: if n=2, array of 6 numbers. After sorting, we take the 4th (index 4) and the 2nd (index 2) and sum.\n\n   Output: a single integer (the sum).\n\n Program 2 (atcoder_ABC170_A):\n   - Reads a line of space-separated integers? Actually, it reads a line and splits by space, then looks for the first occurrence of \"0\" and outputs the 1-indexed position of that zero.\n   - But note: the input to this program is the output of the first program (which is a single integer). So the input to this program is a string that is a single integer.\n\n   However, the program splits the input by space and then iterates until it finds a \"0\". Since the input is a single integer (non-zero, unless the first program outputs 0) then:\n        input_array = [ \"some_number\" ] (one element)\n        then it increments result (to 1) and then checks if that element is \"0\". If it is, break; otherwise, it will then break out of the loop? Actually, it breaks only when it finds \"0\".\n\n   But note: the first program outputs a number. If that number is not zero, then the loop does not break until after the first element? Actually, the loop iterates over each string in the array. There is only one string. So:\n        result = 0\n        for the first element: \n            result becomes 1\n            then if the element is \"0\", break -> so if the number is 0, then break and output 1.\n            if the element is not \"0\", then the loop continues? But there is only one element. So the loop ends.\n\n        Then it prints `result` which is 1.\n\n   Therefore, if the first program outputs 0, then this program outputs 1.\n   If the first program outputs a non-zero, then this program outputs 1.\n\n   But wait: the program breaks when it finds a zero? Actually, the break happens only when the current string is \"0\". Otherwise, it just goes to the next element? But there is only one element.\n\n   So regardless of the value, the output of the second program is 1? \n\n   However, let me read the problem again: the original problem for the second program is \"Five Variables\". The problem statement: There are five variables x1,x2,x3,x4,x5. They are integers. Find the index i (from 1 to 5) such that xi=0. The program reads one line with five space separated integers. But in our chain, the input to the second program is a single integer (the output of the first program). \n\n   This is a problem: the second program expects five integers. However, the first program outputs a single integer. This mismatch is critical.\n\n   But note: the chain is defined by the output of the first becoming the input to the second. The first outputs a single integer. The second program, if run independently, would read five integers. But when chained, it reads a single integer. How does that work?\n\n   Actually, the second program is reading a whole line and splitting by space. The input from the first program is a single integer followed by a newline. So the second program reads one token? Then the array `input_array` has one element.\n\n   The problem: the original second program was designed for a specific problem (Five Variables) that expects five numbers. But in the chain, it receives one. So the behavior is different.\n\n   However, we are to mimic the chain. So we must run the second program as is, with the input being the output of the first. So the second program will read one integer string and then output 1 (because it counts the first token and then breaks only if that token is \"0\", but if it's not, it still counts one and then the loop ends). \n\n   Therefore, the second program always outputs 1? Unless the first program outputs 0, then it breaks and outputs 1? So the output is always 1.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a string that is \"0\"? Then the second program breaks at the first token and outputs 1. So in any case, the output is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the second program in this chain is effectively a constant function that returns 1.\n\n Program 3 (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n   - It reads a string and replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n   - Then it traverses the string:\n          tmp = 0\n          for each char c in the string:\n             if c == 'A': tmp++\n             if c == 'D': cnt += tmp\n             else (meaning if it's not 'A' and not 'D'): tmp = 0\n\n   - Then it outputs `cnt`.\n\n   The input to this program is the output of the second program, which is \"1\" (as a string) followed by a newline? Actually, the second program prints an integer and then a newline. So the third program reads the string \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, we are going to run the third program on the string \"1\".\n\n   Steps for the third program on input \"1\":\n        Replace \"BC\" with \"D\": the string is \"1\", so no change.\n        Traverse:\n            i=0: char '1' -> else: set tmp=0.\n        Then output 0.\n\n   So the entire chain: \n        First program: reads n and an array of 3*n integers, processes and outputs a number (say S).\n        Second program: reads S (as a string) and outputs 1 (because it counts one token and then the loop ends).\n        Third program: reads \"1\", processes and outputs 0.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is always 0.\n\n However, note: the chain is executed in sequence. The first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input.\n\n But wait: the second program's output is the string \"1\\n\". The third program reads that entire string? Actually, the third program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token (by default, tokens are delimited by whitespace). So it would read \"1\" and ignore the newline? Then the rest of the input (the newline) would be left? But the third program only reads one token.\n\n   So the string processed by the third program is \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain always produces 0.\n\n However, we must write a Fortran program that does the following:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program: an integer `n` and then 3*n integers.\n   Step 2: Process the first program: sort the array and compute the sum of every other element from the second largest down (as described).\n   Step 3: Pass the result (an integer) to the second program. But the second program in the chain always outputs 1? So we can skip the second program and just use the constant 1? Or we simulate the second program: it counts tokens until it finds a zero? But we know the input to the second program is a single token (the integer from step 2). So we can do:\n\n        token = string representation of the integer from step 2.\n        result2 = 1   (because we have one token and we break only if that token is \"0\", but even then we break after setting result to 1)\n\n   Step 4: Then we pass the string \"1\" to the third program? Actually, we don't need to do the replacement because the string is \"1\". Then we traverse and set:\n        cnt = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        for each character in \"1\":\n            if character is not 'A' and not 'D', then set tmp=0.\n\n        so cnt remains 0.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is 0.\n\n However, note: the chain might be arbitrary and the second program might behave differently if the first program outputs a string with multiple tokens? But the first program outputs one integer and a newline. So the second program reads one token.\n\n   So we can hardcode the second program's output as 1? But the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". So we must simulate the second program? \n\n   But in Fortran, we are going to avoid I/O in the middle. So we will:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the array of 3*n integers.\n        Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (call it res1).\n        Step 3: Simulate the second program: \n                We have a string = the representation of res1 (without any extra spaces? and without a newline) as a single token.\n                Then we set result2 = 1 (because we have one token, and we break when we see the token if it's zero? but note: the break condition is only if the token is \"0\", but we don't break until after we have incremented to 1 and then we break? and if it's not zero, we just have one token and then the loop ends -> result2=1).\n\n        Step 4: Now, the third program: we have an input string which is the representation of the second program's output? But note: the second program outputs the integer 1 followed by a newline. However, the third program uses `in.next()` which would read the token \"1\". So we can represent the input to the third program as the string \"1\".\n\n        Alternatively, note: the second program's output is \"1\\n\". But the third program only reads the token \"1\". So we can use the string \"1\".\n\n        Then we process the string \"1\": \n            Replace \"BC\" with \"D\" -> becomes \"1\"\n            Traverse: \n                char = '1' -> else: set tmp=0 -> cnt remains 0.\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n   However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then the string for the second program is \"0\". Then the second program: \n        token = \"0\": \n            result = 0 -> then increment to 1 -> then check: if \"0\".equals(str) -> true -> break.\n        then output 1.\n\n        Then the third program gets the string \"1\" -> same as above -> output 0.\n\n   So regardless, the second program outputs 1 and the third outputs 0.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain always outputs 0.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs multiple tokens? It doesn't: it outputs one integer.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        Read n and the array of 3*n integers.\n        Compute res1 (the sum as described).\n        Then set the output of the second program to 1 (without any condition? because the second program always outputs 1).\n        Then set the string for the third program to \"1\".\n        Then run the third program on \"1\": which gives 0.\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". We must simulate the chain exactly. But we see that the second program always outputs 1. So we can skip the second program simulation? \n\n   But let's simulate the second program for correctness:\n\n        We have a string s = the string representation of res1 (without any extra spaces and without a newline? but the first program printed without any extra spaces? and then a newline).\n\n        The second program reads a line and splits by space -> tokens = [ s ] (one token).\n\n        Then it sets result=0.\n        For each token in tokens:\n            result += 1 -> becomes 1.\n            if the token is \"0\", break the loop -> so if res1==0, we break and output 1.\n            else, we continue to the next token? but there is none -> so we break the loop naturally.\n\n        So in either case, result2 = 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can just set result2 = 1.\n\n   And then the third program: we process the string \"1\" (because the second program outputs the integer 1 and then a newline, but the third program only takes the token \"1\").\n\n   However, what if the second program outputs more than one token? It doesn't: it outputs one integer and a newline.\n\n   So the third program will read the token \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then read 3*n integers into an array.\n        Step 2: Sort the array (descending? but note: in Java, Arrays.sort sorts in ascending order. Then the program takes from the end: \n            array[3*n-2] (which is the second largest), then 3*n-4, etc.\n\n        Actually: \n            After sorting in ascending order: \n                index 0: smallest\n                index 3*n-1: largest.\n\n            The program uses:\n                head = 3*n - 2   (which is the second largest in the entire array)\n                then head -= 2 each time.\n\n            So we are taking: \n                positions: 3*n-2, 3*n-4, ... until we have taken n numbers.\n\n        Step 3: Compute the sum of these.\n\n        Step 4: Then we set the result for the second program to 1.\n\n        Step 5: Then we set the string for the third program to \"1\".\n\n        Step 6: Then we process the string \"1\" for the third program: \n                Replace \"BC\" with \"D\" -> \"1\" remains \"1\".\n                Then traverse: \n                    character '1' -> not 'A' and not 'D' -> set tmp=0.\n\n                Then the count remains 0.\n\n        Step 7: Print 0.\n\n   However, note: the third program might be designed to read the entire input? But the input is \"1\\n\", and the token \"1\" is read. The newline is left? But the third program only uses the first token.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n        We need to read the input for the first program: \n            integer n, then 3*n integers.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            integer :: n, i, head, res1\n            integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n            character(len=20) :: str   ! for converting res1 to string? Actually, we don't need to convert because the second program's output is fixed to 1? But we skip the second program's simulation? We know the second program always outputs 1.\n\n            ! Step 1: read n\n            read(*,*) n\n            allocate(array(3*n))\n            do i = 1, 3*n\n                read(*,*) array(i)\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 2: sort the array (ascending)\n            call sort(array, 3*n)   ! We need to implement a sort? Or use an intrinsic? Fortran has no built-in sort for integers? We can write a simple one.\n\n            ! Now, we want to take the elements at indices: 3*n-1, 3*n-2, ...? Actually, the Java program uses 0-indexed. In our array, the first element is index 1 (Fortran). So:\n            ! In Java: \n            !   sorted array: index0 (smallest) ... index3*n-1 (largest)\n            !   head = 3*n - 2 (which is the second last) -> that is the element at position 3*n-1-1 = 3*n-2? But in Fortran, if we sort in ascending order, then:\n            !       array(1) is smallest, array(3*n) is largest.\n            !   So the largest is at 3*n, then the second largest at 3*n-1, then the third at 3*n-2, etc.\n\n            ! The Java program takes:\n            !   first: array[3*n-2] -> which is the second largest? (because the last is 3*n-1, then second last is 3*n-2) -> in Fortran: that is array(3*n-1) [if we use 1-indexed: the element at position 3*n-1?]\n\n            ! How to map: \n            !   Java index i -> Fortran index: i+1.\n            !   So Java index 3*n-2 -> Fortran index 3*n-1.\n\n            ! So in Fortran:\n            !   We want to take:\n            !       element at 3*n-1, then 3*n-3, ... until we have taken n numbers.\n\n            res1 = 0\n            head = 3*n - 1   ! because we start at the second largest? Actually, the largest is at 3*n, the second largest at 3*n-1, the third at 3*n-2, the fourth at 3*n-3? \n            ! But the Java program: \n            !   head = 3*n-2 (Java index) -> Fortran index: 3*n-1? \n            !   Then next head: 3*n-4 -> Fortran index: 3*n-3.\n\n            do i = 1, n\n                res1 = res1 + array(head)\n                head = head - 2\n            end do\n\n            ! Now, the second program: we know the output is always 1. So we skip the conversion of res1 to string and the token counting? We set the second program's result to 1.\n\n            ! Then the third program: we are going to process the string \"1\"\n\n            ! But note: the third program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", so we have a string \"1\", then we traverse:\n            integer :: cnt, tmp\n            character(len=1) :: c\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\n            ! The third program input is \"1\"\n            s = \"1\"\n\n            cnt = 0\n            tmp = 0\n            do i = 1, len(s)\n                c = s(i:i)\n                if (c == 'A') then\n                    tmp = tmp + 1\n                else if (c == 'D') then\n                    cnt = cnt + tmp\n                else\n                    tmp = 0\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Output cnt\n            write(*,*) cnt\n\n            deallocate(array)\n        end program\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if the first program outputs 0? Then the second program would break early? But we determined that even then the output is 1. So we don't need to simulate the second program at all? We can just set the string for the third program to \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the entire second program simulation and just use the constant string \"1\" for the third program.\n\n   But note: what if the first program outputs a number that has a space? It doesn't: it is a single integer.\n\n   So the Fortran program:\n\n        We read n and the array of 3*n integers.\n        We sort the array in ascending order.\n        We compute the sum of the elements at positions: 3*n-1, 3*n-3, ... (n times) in the sorted array.\n\n        Then we set the input to the third program as the string \"1\".\n\n        Then we run the third program on \"1\", which gives 0.\n\n        Then we output 0.\n\n   However, we must note: the second program in the chain is fixed to output 1 regardless of the first program's output.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain always outputs 0.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a negative number? The second program: the token is the string of that negative number. The second program does:\n        token: e.g., \"-5\"\n        then result becomes 1 -> then check: if \"-5\" equals \"0\"? -> false -> then next token? none -> done -> output 1.\n\n   So the second program always outputs 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n            integer :: n, i, j, temp, head, res1, cnt, tmp, length\n            integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n            character(len=1) :: c\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\n            ! Read n\n            read(*,*) n\n            allocate(array(3*n))\n            do i = 1, 3*n\n                read(*,*) array(i)\n            end do\n\n            ! Sort the array (ascending) using a simple bubble sort? But 3*n might be up to 30000? (n up to 10000 -> 30000 elements) -> bubble sort O(n^2) is too slow.\n\n            ! We'll use an intrinsic? Fortran doesn't have a standard sort for integers? But we can use `quicksort` from a library? However, we are to write a single program.\n\n            ! We can write a simple quick sort or use the `sort` from the standard? Actually, Fortran has no intrinsic sort. We'll use a built-in from the compiler? But we are to be portable.\n\n            ! Alternatively, we can use the `minloc` and swap? But that is O(n^2). The constraints: n up to 10000 -> 30000 elements -> 30000^2 = 900e6 which might be too slow.\n\n            ! The problem does not specify constraints? But the original Java program uses Arrays.sort which is O(n log n). We should use an efficient sort.\n\n            ! We'll implement a merge sort or use an available one? But for simplicity and since the problem does not specify constraints, we'll use a simple bubble sort? However, worst-case 30000 elements -> 900 million operations -> too slow.\n\n            ! Instead, we'll use the `quicksort` algorithm.\n\n            ! But note: we are combining and the original Java program uses a sort. We must sort in ascending order.\n\n            ! Alternatively, we can use the fact that we are going to take only the top 2n elements? Actually, we are going to take every other element from the second largest down? We don't need a full sort? We can use a selection algorithm? But the problem says: we must mimic the chain.\n\n            ! Since the original sorts, we must sort.\n\n            ! We'll write a quicksort.\n\n            ! However, to keep it simple and because we are not sure of the constraints, we'll use the `sort` subroutine from the Fortran standard library? But there isn't one.\n\n            ! Let me look: Fortran 90 and above? We can use an intrinsic? Actually, no. So we write a recursive quicksort? But recursion might be deep for 30000? We can use iterative? Or we can use the `qsort` from the C library? But the problem says to write in Fortran.\n\n            ! Alternatively, we can use the `heap sort`? \n\n            ! I'll write a simple heap sort or quick sort? But the problem doesn't specify performance.\n\n            ! Since the problem is from programming competitions, we assume the constraints are such that O(n^2) is too slow. So we do a quick sort.\n\n            ! We'll write a recursive quicksort. We hope the stack is deep enough.\n\n            ! But note: the array size is 30000 -> worst-case recursion depth O(n) -> 30000 which might be too deep? We can do iterative.\n\n            ! Alternatively, we can use the sort from the Fortran standard? Actually, no standard sort.\n\n            ! We'll write a quicksort with random pivot to avoid worst-case.\n\n            ! But for brevity, we'll use the `sort` from the `iso_fortran_env`? No.\n\n            ! Actually, we can use the `intrinsic` module? There isn't one.\n\n            ! We decide to write a simple quick sort.\n\n            ! However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". We can use any sort as long as it is ascending.\n\n            ! We'll write a recursive quicksort.\n\n            ! But note: the entire chain might be tested with small n? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n            ! We'll do:\n\n            call quicksort(array, 1, 3*n)\n\n            ! Then proceed.\n\n            res1 = 0\n            head = 3*n - 1   ! starting at the second largest? Because the largest is at 3*n, then second largest at 3*n-1, etc.\n\n            do i = 1, n\n                res1 = res1 + array(head)\n                head = head - 2\n            end do\n\n            !

We must be cautious: the partitioning.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the sort that is available in Fortran via `gfortran` has `qsort`? But we are to be portable.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the environment, we'll write a simple sort that works.\n\n   But note: the array is of integers. We can use the built-in `minval` and `maxval`? No.\n\n   We'll use the `quicksort` as above.\n\n   However, the above partitioning might be flawed. Let me test:\n\n        We choose a pivot (the middle element). Then we move i from left until we find an element >= pivot, and j from right until we find an element <= pivot. Then swap and continue until i>=j.\n\n        Then we partition at j? Actually, we break when i>=j, then we sort [first, j] and [j+1, last]? \n\n   But I recall: the standard Hoare partition returns j as the split.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        call quicksort(arr, first, j)\n        call quicksort(arr, j+1, last)\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   However, we must be cautious for the base case.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the `sort` from the Fortran standard library? There isn't one.\n\n   We'll proceed with the quicksort.\n\n   But note: worst-case stack depth? The worst-case is O(n) which for 30000 might be too deep? We can use an iterative version? But the problem doesn't specify constraints. And n is 10000 -> 30000 elements. Worst-case recursion depth is about 30,000? That might be too deep.\n\n   We can use an iterative quicksort with a stack? But that is complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the heap sort which is O(n log n) and O(1) space? \n\n   We'll write a heap sort.\n\n   However, for simplicity and because the problem does not specify the constraints, and the original Java program uses a sort, we'll assume that the input size is manageable by a recursive quicksort? But worst-case recursion depth might be 30000? That is too deep.\n\n   We'll change to heap sort.\n\n   Heap sort:\n\n        subroutine heapsort(arr, n)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n            integer, intent(in) :: n\n            integer :: i, temp\n\n            ! Build heap (rearrange array)\n            do i = n/2, 1, -1\n                call heapify(arr, n, i)\n            end do\n\n            ! One by one extract an element from heap\n            do i = n, 2, -1\n                ! Move current root to end\n                temp = arr(1)\n                arr(1) = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = temp\n\n                ! call heapify on the reduced heap\n                call heapify(arr, i-1, 1)\n            end do\n        end subroutine\n\n        subroutine heapify(arr, n, i)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n            integer, intent(in) :: n, i\n            integer :: largest, left, right, temp\n            largest = i\n            left = 2*i\n            right = 2*i+1\n\n            if (left <= n) then\n                if (arr(left) > arr(largest)) then\n                    largest = left\n                end if\n            end if\n\n            if (right <= n) then\n                if (arr(right) > arr(largest)) then\n                    largest = right\n                end if\n            end if\n\n            if (largest /= i) then\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(largest)\n                arr(largest) = temp\n                call heapify(arr, n, largest)\n            end if\n        end subroutine\n\n   But note: the heap sort builds a max heap and then sorts in ascending order? Actually, the above heapify builds a max heap. Then we move the root (max) to the end. So we get ascending order.\n\n   However, the above heapify uses 1-indexed? Yes.\n\n   We'll do heap sort.\n\n   But note: the array is 1-indexed? In our program, we have `array(1:3*n)`. So we can use the heap sort above.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        call heapsort(array, 3*n)\n\n   Then the array is sorted in ascending order: the smallest at index 1, the largest at index 3*n.\n\n   Then we do:\n\n        res1 = 0\n        head = 3*n - 1   ! starting at the second largest? Because the largest is at 3*n, then second largest at 3*n-1, then third largest at 3*n-2, etc.\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            res1 = res1 + array(head)\n            head = head - 2\n        end do\n\n   But note: if we use heap sort, the array is sorted in ascending order? Then the element at 3*n is the largest, at 3*n-1 is the second largest, etc.\n\n   So the above is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the program:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n            integer :: n, i, head, res1, cnt, tmp, length\n            integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n            character(len=1) :: c\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\n            read(*,*) n\n            allocate(array(3*n))\n            do i = 1, 3*n\n                read(*,*) array(i)\n            end do\n\n            call heapsort(array, 3*n)\n\n            res1 = 0\n            head = 3*n - 1\n            do i = 1, n\n                res1 = res1 + array(head)\n                head = head - 2\n            end do\n\n            s = \"1\"\n\n            cnt = 0\n            tmp = 0\n            length = len(s)\n            do i = 1, length\n                c = s(i:i)\n                if (c == 'A') then\n                    tmp = tmp + 1\n                else if (c == 'D') then\n                    cnt = cnt + tmp\n                else\n                    tmp = 0\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            write(*,*) cnt\n\n            deallocate(array)\n\n        contains\n\n            subroutine heapsort(arr, n)\n                integer, intent(in) :: n\n                integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n                integer :: i, temp\n\n                ! Build heap (rearrange array)\n                do i = n/2, 1, -1\n                    call heapify(arr, n, i)\n                end do\n\n                do i = n, 2, -1\n                    temp = arr(1)\n                    arr(1) = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = temp\n                    call heapify(arr, i-1, 1)\n                end do\n            end subroutine heapsort\n\n            recursive subroutine heapify(arr, n, i)\n                integer, intent(in) :: n, i\n                integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n                integer :: largest, left, right, temp\n\n                largest = i\n                left = 2*i\n                right = 2*i + 1\n\n                if (left <= n) then\n                    if (arr(left) > arr(largest)) then\n                        largest = left\n                    end if\n                end if\n\n                if (right <= n) then\n                    if (arr(right) > arr(largest)) then\n                        largest = right\n                    end if\n                end if\n\n                if (largest /= i) then\n                    temp = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = arr(largest)\n                    arr(largest) = temp\n                    call heapify(arr, n, largest)\n                end if\n            end subroutine heapify\n\n        end program\n\n   But note: the heapify is recursive. For a large array, the recursion depth of heapify is O(log n). So it's safe.\n\n   However, the heap sort might be O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n   We'll run and hope.\n\n   But note: the entire chain output is always 0.\n\n   We output 0.\n\n   However, we must test with a small example.\n\n   Example: n=1, then array has 3 elements: [1,2,3] (for example)\n\n        Sorted: [1,2,3] (ascending: index1=1, index2=2, index3=3)\n\n        Then head = 3*1-1 = 2 -> we take array(2)=2.\n\n        Then res1 = 2.\n\n        Then the second program: we skip -> set the string to \"1\".\n\n        Then the third program: on \"1\" -> output 0.\n\n   So the final output is 0.\n\n   But what is the expected output of the chain?\n\n   The first program: outputs 2.\n\n   The second program: input \"2\", then outputs 1.\n\n   The third program: input \"1\", outputs 0.\n\n   So 0 is correct.\n\n   Another test: n=2, array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\n        Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\n        head = 3*2-1 = 5 -> element at 5: 5? \n        then head=5-2=3: element at 3: 3\n        res1 = 5+3 = 8.\n\n        Then the chain: second program outputs 1, third outputs 0.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program is as above.\n\n   However, note: the heap sort we implemented is for 1-indexed arrays? Yes.\n\n   We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the heap sort we implemented sorts in ascending order? Yes.\n\n   Therefore, we output the program.\n\n   But note: the third program's input is always \"1\", so we don't need to allocate a string of variable length? We can set:\n\n        s = \"1\"\n\n   And then the length is 1.\n\n   So the program is:\n\n        (as above)\n\n   We'll write it."
