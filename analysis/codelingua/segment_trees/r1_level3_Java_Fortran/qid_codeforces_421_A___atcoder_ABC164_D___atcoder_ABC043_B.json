However, there are potential issues:\n\n      - The first program: the condition `any(list1 == i)` might be inefficient for large a and n? But a and n are not specified. We assume a is not too large (like 100). But if a is 100000, then we need a better method. We can create a boolean array for indices 1..n:\n\n            logical, dimension(:), allocatable :: in_list1\n            allocate(in_list1(n))\n            in_list1 = .false. do i=1, a\n                if (list1(i) >=1 .and. list1(i)<=n) then\n                    in_list1(list1(i)) = .true.\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then when building S1:\n\n            do i=1, n\n                if (in_list1(i)) then\n                    S1(i:i) = '1'\n                else\n                    S1(i:i) = '2'\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        This is O(n+a) which is efficient.\n\n      - The second program: we are storing the entire mod_arr of length n? And n can be up to 200000? That's acceptable. We'll update accordingly. Let's write the full code. We'll use:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: n, a, b, i, j, tmp, radix, N1, MODVAL\n        integer, allocatable, dimension(:) :: list1, list2\n        logical, allocatable, dimension(:) :: in_list1\n        integer, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n        integer, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans, nci\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S1, S2, S3\n        character(len=20) :: temp\n        character(len=1) :: c\n        MODVAL = 2019\n\n        !

But note: the second program uses 0-indexed mod_arr? We are using 1-indexed arrays. The algorithm is the same. We hope it works. We note: the third program might be redundant? But we include it.

But note: the second program's algorithm uses mod 2019 and the radix. We must be cautious about the mod arithmetic. Let's test with a small example. Example for the first program:\n\n        n=2, a=1, b=1\n        list1 = [1]\n        list2 = [2] Then S1: \n            i=1: in list1 -> '1'\n            i=2: not in list1 -> '2'\n            so S1 = \"12\"\n\n        Then the second program:\n\n            N1 = 2\n            mod_arr(1:2)\n            mod_cnt = [0] * 2019\n\n            i=1: \n                j = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 -> character at 2: '2'\n                tmp = 2 * 1 mod 2019 = 2\n                since i=1 (first iteration) -> no previous\n                mod_arr(1)=2\n                mod_cnt[2] becomes 1\n                radix = 10 mod 2019 = 10\n\n            i=2:\n                j = 2-2+1 = 1 -> character at 1: '1'\n                tmp = 1 * 10 mod 2019 = 10\n                then add mod_arr(1) = 2 -> 10+2 = 12 mod 2019 = 12\n                mod_arr(2)=12\n                mod_cnt[12] becomes 1\n                radix = 10*10 mod 2019 = 100\n\n            Then mod_cnt[0] becomes 1 (so mod_cnt[0]=1, others: mod_cnt[2]=1, mod_cnt[12]=1)\n\n            ans = 0\n            for mod_cnt[0]: 1 -> 1*0/2 = 0\n            for mod_cnt[2]: 1 -> 0\n            for mod_cnt[12]: 1 -> 0\n            then mod_cnt[0] was increased: so we have mod_cnt[0]=1 -> 0\n            so ans=0\n\n            Then S2 = \"0\"\n\n            Then the third program: \n                S2 = \"0\"\n                then S3 = \"0\"\n\n            Output: \"0\"\n\n        What is the expected? The second program counts the number of substrings divisible by 2019. The string \"12\" has substrings: \n            \"1\" -> 1 mod2019=1 -> not 0\n            \"2\" -> 2 mod2019=2 -> not 0\n            \"12\" -> 12 mod2019=12 -> not 0\n            So 0 substrings. Then the third program outputs \"0\". So it matches. Therefore, we write the Fortran code accordingly. Note: We must be cautious about the indices and mod arithmetic. We'll use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: MOD = 2019   ! for clarity\n\n   And in the mod_arr loop:\n\n        tmp = mod( (digit * radix), MOD) if (i>1) then   ! because i=1 is the first\n            tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), MOD)\n        end if\n\n   Also, note: the radix is updated by multiplying by 10 mod MOD. We must use nonnegative mod? Fortran mod is nonnegative. We'll use:\n\n        tmp = mod(digit * radix, MOD) if (i>1) tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), MOD)\n\n   Then set mod_arr(i)=tmp. And update the frequency. We'll use integer*4 for mod_arr and mod_cnt? But the mod_arr values are in [0,2018]. And mod_cnt is an array of 2019 integers. The variable `ans` must be integer*8 to avoid overflow? Because mod_cnt[i] can be large? The string length n can be up to 200000 (from the first program: n is the first integer).",

Yes, because it's a binomial coefficient. We'll do:\n\n        do i=0, MOD-1\n            if (mod_cnt(i) < 2) cycle\n            nci = int(mod_cnt(i), 8)   ! convert to int64\n            ans = ans + nci*(nci-1_8)/2_8\n        end do\n\n   But note: the division by 2 must be integer division. Since nci*(nci-1) is even, it's safe.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The first program (codeforces_421_A) reads:\n   n, a, b\n   then a list of 'a' integers (list1)\n   then a list of 'b' integers (list2)\n   then it outputs a sequence of n integers: for each i from 1 to n, \n        if (i+1) is in list1, output 1; otherwise output 2.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) reads a string S and computes the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\n The third program (atcoder_ABC043_B) reads a string and processes it by:\n   - appending '0' for character '0'\n   - appending '1' for character '1'\n   - removing the last character for character 'B'\n\n However, note the instructions:\n   - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n   - Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\n We are to chain them: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But note the first program outputs a sequence of n integers (each 1 or 2) separated by spaces. This output is a string.\n\n The second program expects a string of digits (without spaces) because it processes the string as a number.\n\n However, the first program outputs a string of numbers (each 1 or 2) with spaces. We must remove the spaces to form a contiguous string of digits? \n But note the second program expects a string that represents a number. The example might not have spaces. So we must remove the spaces.\n\n Alternatively, we can change the first program to output without spaces? But the problem says: \"behaves identically\" meaning the chain.\n\n Actually, the chain: \n   First program: writes integers with space separation and no newline at the end? Actually, it uses `System.out.print(1 + \" \")` so the last character is a space.\n\n Then the second program reads a string from standard input. So the input to the second program is a string of digits and spaces? \n\n But the second program expects a string of digits. So we must adjust.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How are we going to chain without I/O in the middle? We will do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, a, b, then two lists of integers).\n   Step 2: Run the first program's logic and capture its output as a string (without actually printing it). Then remove the trailing space? Actually, the last character is a space. We can build a string without the trailing space? But note: the original program outputs a trailing space at the end.\n\n   However, the second program will read the entire string including the spaces? But the second program only reads one token? Actually, the second program uses `sc.next()` which reads the next token (without spaces). But if we are chaining, the output of the first program is a sequence of tokens (each token is a digit) separated by spaces. The second program's `sc.next()` would read the first token and leave the rest? That's not what we want.\n\n Therefore, we must reinterpret the chain: the entire output of the first program (a string of n tokens, each token is a digit and separated by a space) is passed as input to the second program. But the second program expects a single token? \n\n Actually, the second program is designed to read a single string of digits (without spaces). So we have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Modify the first program to output without spaces? But the problem says \"behave identically\". However, note that the chain: the first program writes to stdout and the second reads from stdin. The second program will read the entire line? Actually, the second program uses `sc.next()`, which reads the next token. The first token in the output of the first program is the first digit? Then the next token is the next digit? But the first program outputs n tokens. The second program would only read the first token? \n\n This is a problem.\n\n Alternatively, we note that the problem states: \"the entire sequence\". We must simulate the entire chain. But the original chain would not work because the second program would read only the first token of the first program's output. \n\n How did the original chain work? The problem does not specify. But we are to write a Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior as the chain.\n\n We must consider: the chain of the three programs is:\n\n   Program1: reads from stdin (the initial input) and writes to stdout.\n   Program2: reads from stdin (which is the output of Program1) and writes to stdout.\n   Program3: reads from stdin (which is the output of Program2) and writes to stdout.\n\n But the output of Program1 is a sequence of n integers (each 1 or 2) with a space separating them and no newline at the end? Actually, each `System.out.print` prints without newline. The last thing printed is a space? Then the output of Program1 is a string of n tokens (each token is a digit) with a space after every token, including the last one.\n\n Then Program2 uses `sc.next()` which will read the first token (the first digit) and then the next token? But Program2 only reads one token. The rest of the tokens are left for the next `next()` but they are never read. So Program2 would only process the first token? That doesn't seem right.\n\n We must reconsider the chain. The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of the first program becomes the entire input of the second program? Then the second program should read the entire string (including spaces) as one token? But `sc.next()` breaks on whitespace.\n\n Therefore, the chain as described would break. \n\n However, note the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". And \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n We must simulate the same I/O as the chain. But the original chain would break because the second program would only read the first token. \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the output of the first program is a string of n digits (with spaces) and the second program reads the entire line? But the second program uses `sc.next()`, not `nextLine()`. \n\n We have to look at the problem statements for the original programs? But they are not provided. \n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, we must make a design decision:\n\n   We assume that the intended chain is that the output of the first program is passed as a string of digits without spaces to the second program. Why? Because the second program is about counting substrings divisible by 2019, and having spaces would break the number.\n\n How can we do that? We will:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program: n, a, b, then list1 (a integers), then list2 (b integers).\n   Step 2: Build the output string of the first program without spaces? Or build it with spaces and then remove the spaces? \n\n   But note: the first program outputs: \n        for i=1 to n: \n            if (i) is in list1 then output \"1 \" (including space) else \"2 \" (including space)\n\n   So the entire output is a string of n digits each followed by a space. The last character is a space.\n\n   We want to pass to the second program a string of n digits (without spaces). So we remove the spaces? \n\n   Then the second program will process that string of n digits.\n\n   Step 3: The second program's logic: \n        S = the string without spaces (of n digits) from step 2.\n\n        Then it computes an array `mod_arr` and a frequency array `mod_cnt` for mod 2019.\n        Then it counts the pairs (i, j) such that the substring S[i..j] is divisible by 2019? Actually, the method is: \n            mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 (for the empty prefix?) and then for each mod value, it does C(count,2).\n\n        The output of the second program is a long integer (the number of substrings divisible by 2019) printed as a string.\n\n   Step 4: The third program reads the output of the second program (which is a string of digits? Or a number? It is printed as `System.out.println(ans);` so it's a decimal integer without any spaces, and then a newline?).\n\n        Then the third program processes that string: \n            It builds a string by processing each character:\n                '0' -> append \"0\"\n                '1' -> append \"1\"\n                'B' -> delete last character\n\n        But note: the output of the second program is a number. For example, if the answer is 10, then the string is \"10\". \n\n        Then the third program would process the string \"10\":\n            character '1': append \"1\" -> d becomes \"1\"\n            character '0': append \"0\" -> d becomes \"10\"\n\n        Then it outputs \"10\".\n\n   However, the chain: the output of the second program is a string that might contain digits only? But the third program expects only the characters '0','1','B'. \n\n   The output of the second program is a number, so it will only contain digits? Then the third program will only see digits and the 'B' case will never occur? \n\n   So the third program will simply build the same string as the output of the second program? \n\n   But wait: the third program also handles the character 'B'. The input to the third program is the output of the second program, which is a string of digits. There is no 'B' in that string. So the third program will just build the exact same string? Then why do we need it?\n\n   This suggests that the chain as provided might not be intended. \n\n Given the ambiguity, we must stick to the requirement: the entire sequence.\n\n We decide:\n\n   The Fortran program will:\n\n     1. Read the initial input: \n          n, a, b\n          then a integers (the list1)\n          then b integers (the list2)\n\n     2. Build the output of the first program as a string of n digits (each 1 or 2) without any spaces? But the original first program outputs with spaces. \n\n        However, to make the second program work, we must remove the spaces. We assume that the intended input to the second program is the digits without spaces.\n\n        Why? Because the second program is about a string of digits. \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and the original chain would break. We are allowed to fix the chain? \n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must simulate the original chain including the broken behavior? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify how the programs are chained (piping? redirection?) and how the second program would interpret the input.\n\n        In a typical Unix pipe: \n            java Program1 | java Program2\n\n        The second program would read the entire output of the first program as its standard input. And the Scanner's `next()` would read the first token (the first digit) and then the rest of the tokens would be available for subsequent `next()` calls. But the second program only calls `next()` once. So it only gets the first token? \n\n        Then the second program would only process the first digit? \n\n        This is not the intended behavior of the second program. \n\n        Therefore, we must assume that the chain is designed such that the output of the first program is a single token? \n\n        How? The problem does not say. \n\n        Given the complexity, and since we are writing a single Fortran program, we can reinterpret the chain as:\n\n          The first program produces a string of n digits (without spaces). Why? Because the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning the same final output for the same initial input. And the original chain might have been designed with the understanding that the first program outputs without spaces? \n\n        But the first program as given does output with spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have a mistake? \n\n        After re-examining the first program: \n            It outputs: for each i, either \"1 \" or \"2 \", so the output is: \n                \"1 2 1 ... 2 \"\n\n        The second program is designed to read a string of digits without spaces. \n\n        How to reconcile? \n\n        We decide: we will simulate the chain as if the output of the first program is passed as a string of digits without any spaces. Why? Because that is the only way the second program would work as intended. \n\n        Therefore, we will build a string of n digits (each either '1' or '2') without spaces. \n\n        Then the second program will process that string.\n\n     3. Then we run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n     4. Then we take the output of the second program (the number `ans` as a string without newline? but then the third program reads tokens? The third program uses a `LightScanner` that reads tokens? \n\n        The third program reads the entire token? The output of the second program is a single number (printed as a decimal integer) and then a newline? \n\n        The third program's `in.string()` reads tokens (using `StringTokenizer`). So it would read the entire number as one token? \n\n        Then the third program processes the token (a string of digits) by building a new string: \n            for each char in the token:\n                if '0' -> append '0'\n                if '1' -> append '1'\n                if 'B' -> remove last character (but note: the token is a number, so it has only digits, so no 'B')\n\n        Then the third program outputs the same string? \n\n        But note: the third program outputs `d.toString()` and then a newline.\n\n        So the final output is the same as the output of the second program? \n\n        Then the chain: \n            Input: n, a, b, list1, list2\n            Output: the number from the second program? \n\n        But the third program does nothing? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Alternatively, the chain might be:\n\n            Program1: outputs a string of n digits (with spaces) -> but we remove spaces to feed to Program2.\n\n            Program2: processes that string and outputs a number (say, 10) as a string.\n\n            Program3: processes the string \"10\" and outputs \"10\".\n\n        So the final output is \"10\".\n\n        But the original Program3 is designed to process a string that may contain 'B' (backspace). Since the output of Program2 is a number (so no 'B'), Program3 just outputs the same string.\n\n        So the chain does nothing to the output of Program2? \n\n        Then why have Program3?\n\n        We must stick to the specification.\n\n        Therefore, we design:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, a, b, list1 (a integers), list2 (b integers).\n\n          Step 2: Build a string S1 of length n: \n                   For i from 1 to n:\n                         if i is in list1, then set the i-th character to '1'\n                         else set to '2'\n\n          Step 3: Use S1 as the input string for the second program.\n\n          Step 4: Run the second program's algorithm on S1 to compute the number `ans`.\n\n          Step 5: Convert `ans` to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines).\n\n          Step 6: Process the string from step 5 with the third program's logic: \n                   Build a string d by iterating over each character in the string from step 5:\n                         if char is '0', append '0'\n                         if char is '1', append '1'\n                         if char is 'B', remove the last character (if any)\n\n          Step 7: Print the string from step 6 (which is the final output).\n\n        But note: the third program outputs the string and then a newline? The original uses `out.println(d)`, so it appends a newline.\n\n        We will output the string and then a newline.\n\n        However, what if the output of the second program has a newline? The third program reads tokens, so the newline would be skipped? \n\n        Actually, the third program uses `in.string()` which reads tokens (so it skips whitespace). Therefore, the token read by the third program is the number without any trailing newline. \n\n        So we can ignore the newline.\n\n        Therefore, the chain:\n\n          Input: \n            n, a, b\n            list1 (a integers)\n            list2 (b integers)\n\n          Output: \n            The string built in step 6 (the same as the string representation of the number from step 5) and then a newline.\n\n        But note: the third program does nothing because the string from step 5 is only digits, so step 6 will just build the same string. \n\n        So why include it? \n\n        The problem says: the entire sequence. We must do the third program even if it does nothing? \n\n        We do.\n\n        However, what if the number from step 5 has a digit that is not '0' or '1'? For example, if `ans` is 234, then the third program will:\n\n            '2' -> not '0','1','B' -> so the third program does nothing for '2'? \n\n        Looking at the third program:\n\n            switch (c) {\n                case '0': ... break;\n                case '1': ... break;\n                case 'B': ... break;\n            }\n\n        There is no default case. So it ignores any character that is not '0','1','B'. Therefore, for the character '2', it does nothing.\n\n        So the third program would output an empty string? \n\n        But note: the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a string of digits. The digits are in the range '0' to '9'. \n\n        The third program only appends for '0' and '1', and removes for 'B'. For any other digit, it ignores.\n\n        Therefore, for the string \"234\", the third program would build:\n\n            '2' -> ignored -> d remains \"\"\n            '3' -> ignored -> d remains \"\"\n            '4' -> ignored -> d remains \"\"\n\n        Then output an empty string and a newline.\n\n        This is not the same as the original chain? \n\n        But in the original chain, the third program would read the token \"234\" (without the newline) and then process it. \n\n        How did the original third program get the input? The second program wrote the integer 234 and then a newline. Then the third program reads the next token? The token is \"234\". \n\n        Then the third program processes the string \"234\": \n            '2': ignore -> d = \"\"\n            '3': ignore -> d = \"\"\n            '4': ignore -> d = \"\"\n\n        Then it prints an empty string and a newline.\n\n        So the final output is a newline? \n\n        But the second program's output was 234, and the third program outputs nothing? \n\n        That is the behavior.\n\n        However, in our chain we are processing the string \"234\" and getting an empty string.\n\n        But what if the output of the second program has digits that are only '0' and '1'? Then the third program would output the same string? \n\n        So the behavior of the third program is:\n\n            It only appends for '0' and '1', and removes for 'B'. All other characters are ignored.\n\n        We must implement that.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We assume:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, a, b, list1, list2.\n\n      Step 2: Build a string S1 of n characters: \n               For i=1 to n:\n                 if i is in list1, then character '1'\n                 else character '2'\n\n        Note: the original program uses i+1? \n                if (list1.contains(i+1)) -> for i from 0 to n-1, so the index i+1 is from 1 to n.\n                We are building for i from 1 to n: so we use the same condition.\n\n      Step 3: Compute the second program's algorithm on S1 to get a number `ans`.\n\n      Step 4: Convert `ans` to a string (call it S2). Note: `ans` is a nonnegative integer.\n\n      Step 5: Process S2 with the third program's logic to get a string S3.\n\n      Step 6: Print S3 and a newline.\n\n But note: the second program uses a specific algorithm for the string of digits. We must implement that algorithm.\n\n Algorithm for the second program (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n\n   Input: string S (which we built as S1, a string of n characters, each '1' or '2')\n   Steps:\n        N = len(S)\n        We need two arrays: mod_arr (length N) and mod_cnt (length 2019, indices 0..2018) initialized to 0.\n        radix = 1\n        For i from 0 to N-1:\n            tmp = (digit at position (N-1-i) * radix) mod 2019\n            if i != 0:\n                tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019\n            mod_arr[i] = tmp\n            mod_cnt[tmp] += 1\n            radix = (radix * 10) mod 2019\n\n        Then:\n            ans = 0\n            mod_cnt[0] += 1   [Note: the original does mod_cnt[0]++]\n            For i from 0 to 2018:\n                ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i] - 1) / 2\n\n        Then we use `ans` (a long integer) as the output.\n\n   However, note: the original program uses the entire string? But we are building the string without spaces. \n\n   Also, the digit is taken as the character at position (N-1-i) minus '0'. Then multiplied by radix.\n\n   In our case, the string S1 is built from '1' and '2'. So the digit is 1 or 2.\n\n   We must convert the character to an integer.\n\n   Example: \n        char c = S1[N-1-i] \n        digit = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')   [in Fortran]\n\n   But note: the original program does:\n\n        int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n   Then if i != 0, it adds mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019.\n\n   Then stores mod_arr[i] = tmp, and increments mod_cnt[tmp].\n\n   The radix is updated: radix = radix * 10 % 2019.\n\n   We must do the same.\n\n   Important: the mod_arr is computed for the reversed string? Actually, it starts from the last character.\n\n   The algorithm is known: it counts the number of pairs (i, j) such that the substring from i to j (in the original string) is divisible by 2019? Actually, it uses the idea of cumulative mod from the right.\n\n   We trust the algorithm.\n\n   Step 4: Convert `ans` to a string. But note: `ans` can be very large? The original uses long (64-bit integer). In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) or integer*8.\n\n   Step 5: Process the string representation of `ans` with the third program's logic:\n\n        We'll build a string (or a character array) by iterating over each character in the string of `ans`.\n\n        We'll maintain a buffer (a string) that we can append to and remove the last character.\n\n        We start with an empty string.\n\n        For each character in the string of `ans`:\n            if the character is '0': append '0'\n            if the character is '1': append '1'\n            if the character is 'B': remove the last character (if the buffer is not empty)\n            otherwise: do nothing (skip)\n\n        Then the buffer is the result.\n\n   Step 6: Print the buffer and a newline.\n\n However, note: the third program does not ignore digits other than '0' and '1'. It ignores them? Actually, it only handles the cases for '0','1','B'. So for any other digit (like '2','3',...'9'), it does nothing. So we skip.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer :: n, a, b\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list1, list2\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S1   ! the string for the first program output (without spaces)\n        integer :: i, j, tmp, radix, N1\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n        integer, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans   ! because the second program uses long\n\n        Then for the third program:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S2, S3\n        character(len=1000) :: buffer   ! we don't know the length of S2, but we can use a large buffer? or dynamic?\n        integer :: len_buf\n\n        We'll read the input from stdin.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read n, a, b\n        read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n     2. Allocate list1(a) and list2(b)\n        allocate(list1(a), list2(b))\n\n     3. Read list1 and list2\n        do i=1, a\n            read(*,*) list1(i)\n        end do\n        do i=1, b\n            read(*,*) list2(i)\n        end do\n\n     4. Build S1: a string of n characters.\n        We can use a character variable of length n? \n        We'll create a string of length n.\n\n        S1 = ''   ! we'll build it\n        do i=1, n\n            if (any(list1 == i)) then   ! if i is in list1\n                S1 = S1 // '1'\n            else\n                S1 = S1 // '2'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        But note: the original program uses i+1? Actually, in the loop i from 0 to n-1, and checks for i+1. \n        We are doing i from 1 to n, so we are checking the same.\n\n     5. Now run the second program on S1.\n\n        N1 = len(S1)   ! length of S1\n\n        ! Allocate mod_arr(0:N1-1) but in Fortran we can use 1-indexed? We'll use 1 to N1.\n        allocate(mod_arr(N1))   ! we'll use indices 1 to N1 for the array.\n\n        mod_cnt = 0   ! initialize the frequency array\n\n        radix = 1\n        do i=1, N1   ! i from 1 to N1: the i-th element in mod_arr corresponds to the i-th character from the end?\n            ! We are processing the i-th character from the end? \n            ! The original: for (int i=0; i<N; i++) { ... S.charAt(N-1-i) ... }\n\n            ! Let j = N1 - i   -> index in the string (0-indexed in the original). In Fortran, the string is 1-indexed.\n            ! We want the (N1 - i + 1)-th character? \n            ! Because the original: \n            !   i=0: index = N-1-0 = N-1 -> the last character? \n            !   In Fortran: the last character is at index N1.\n\n            ! So we take the character at position: N1 - i + 1? \n            !   i=1: then index = N1-1+1 = N1 -> last character -> good.\n            !   i=2: then index = N1-2+1 = N1-1 -> second last.\n\n            j = N1 - i + 1   ! the position in the string (1-indexed) for the character.\n\n            ! Get the digit: \n            read(S1(j:j), *) tmp   ! This might be inefficient? Alternatively, use ICHAR and subtract '0'\n            ! But we know it's a character '1' or '2'. \n            ! Better: \n            tmp = ichar(S1(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n\n            tmp = mod(tmp * radix, 2019)\n\n            if (i /= 1) then\n                tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n            end if\n\n            mod_arr(i) = tmp\n            mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n\n            radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n        end do\n\n        ! Then add one to mod_cnt(0)\n        mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n        ans = 0\n        do i=0, 2018\n            if (mod_cnt(i) > 1) then\n                ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i), kind=8) * int(mod_cnt(i)-1, kind=8) / 2\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Now `ans` is the result of the second program.\n\n     6. Convert `ans` to a string S2.\n\n        We write `ans` to a character variable.\n\n        We can use internal write.\n\n        We don't know the number of digits, but 64-bit integer maximum is 20 digits.\n\n        character(len=20) :: buffer_ans\n        write(buffer_ans, *) ans   ! but this will write with a space at the beginning? \n        We can use:\n\n        write(buffer_ans, '(I0)') ans   ! I0 writes without leading spaces and without extra spaces.\n\n        But note: the third program expects a string without spaces? \n\n        However, the write with * might add a space. We use formatted I/O.\n\n        Then we remove any leading and trailing spaces? But we want the exact digit string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S2\n        integer :: len_ans\n\n        len_ans = floor(log10(real(ans,8))) + 1   ! if ans>0, but if ans==0 then we want 1.\n\n        But if ans==0, then we need to write '0'.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        write(buffer_ans, '(I0)') ans\n        S2 = trim(adjustl(buffer_ans))   ! but adjustl might not be necessary? \n\n        However, we can simply use:\n\n        write(buffer_ans, *) ans\n        S2 = trim(adjustl(buffer_ans))\n\n        But the original output of the second program is without spaces. So we want the digit string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without spaces:\n\n        character(len=20) :: temp\n        write(temp, '(I0)') ans\n        S2 = trim(temp)\n\n        But note: the third program processes the entire string including any leading spaces? \n\n        The third program uses a token? So in the original chain, the token is the number without spaces. So we want S2 to be the digit string.\n\n        The write with '(I0)' does not add any leading space.\n\n        So we do:\n\n        character(len=30) :: temp   ! 30 is enough\n        write(temp, '(I0)') ans\n        S2 = trim(temp)   ! but trim only removes trailing spaces? and there should be none.\n\n        Actually, we can assign:\n\n        S2 = temp(1:len_trim(temp))\n\n        But we can also use:\n\n        S2 = trim(temp)\n\n     7. Process S2 with the third program.\n\n        We'll build a string S3.\n\n        We can use a buffer that we grow and shrink.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S3\n        character(len=1000) :: buffer   ! we use a fixed buffer and an integer for the current length?\n        integer :: len_buf\n\n        Alternatively, we can build a string by appending and removing.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        len_buf = 0\n        buffer = ''   ! initialize\n\n        do i=1, len(S2)\n            if (S2(i:i) == '0') then\n                len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n            else if (S2(i:i) == '1') then\n                len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n            else if (S2(i:i) == 'B') then\n                if (len_buf > 0) then\n                    len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                end if\n            end if\n            ! otherwise, do nothing\n        end do\n\n        Then S3 = buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n     8. Print S3 and a newline.\n\n        write(*, '(A)') S3\n\n   But note: the third program in the original outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n   However, we are writing a string that is of length `len_buf` and then a newline.\n\n   But what if S3 is empty? Then we write a newline.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the third program might have been designed to output the string without extra spaces? \n\n   We are outputting the buffer from 1 to len_buf.\n\n   But note: the buffer we used has fixed length 1000. We set the relevant part.\n\n   But we don't know the length of S3. It can be up to the length of S2? And S2 is at most 20 digits? So 1000 is safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an allocatable character and build it dynamically? But Fortran is easier with a fixed buffer.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S3\n        integer :: k\n\n        allocate(character(len=0) :: S3)   ! start empty\n        do i=1, len(S2)\n            if (S2(i:i)=='0') then\n                S3 = S3 // '0'\n            else if (S2(i:i)=='1') then\n                S3 = S3 // '1'\n            else if (S2(i:i)=='B') then\n                if (len(S3)>0) then\n                    S3 = S3(1:len(S3)-1)   ! remove last character\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        write(*, '(A)') S3\n\n   But this might be inefficient for long strings? The maximum length of S3 is the length of S2 (which is the string representation of a 64-bit integer, so at most 20). So it's safe.\n\n   We'll use the dynamic method.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        S3 = ''\n        do i=1, len_trim(S2)   ! or just to len(S2) since we built it without spaces?\n            c = S2(i:i)\n            if (c=='0') then\n                S3 = S3 // '0'\n            else if (c=='1') then\n                S3 = S3 // '1'\n            else if (c=='B') then\n                if (len(S3)>0) then\n                    S3 = S3(1:len(S3)-1)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        write(*, '(A)') S3\n\n   But note: the original third program does not do anything for non-'0','1','B'. So we skip.\n\n   However, what if the string S2 has a newline? We built S2 without any newline. So we are safe.\n\n   But note: the second program's output is written without any newline? We built S2 by writing the integer without spaces and then trimming? Actually, the trim removes trailing spaces. The integer written with '(I0)' has no leading or trailing spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we have:\n\n        read n, a, b, list1, list2\n        build S1 (string of n characters: '1' or '2')\n        run the second program's algorithm to compute `ans` (a 64-bit integer)\n        convert `ans` to a string S2 (without spaces)\n        build S3 by processing S2: only keep the '0','1' and handle 'B' by removing last character\n        output S3\n\n   However, note: the third program in the original might have been designed to read multiple tokens? But it only reads one token. We are passing the entire output of the second program as one token? And that token is the string representation of `ans`.\n\n   Therefore, we simulate the chain.\n\n   But note: the second program's algorithm uses mod 2019 and the radix. We must be cautious about the mod arithmetic.\n\n   Let's test with a small example.\n\n   Example for the first program:\n\n        n=2, a=1, b=1\n        list1 = [1]\n        list2 = [2]\n\n        Then S1: \n            i=1: in list1 -> '1'\n            i=2: not in list1 -> '2'\n            so S1 = \"12\"\n\n        Then the second program:\n\n            N1 = 2\n            mod_arr(1:2)\n            mod_cnt = [0] * 2019\n\n            i=1: \n                j = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 -> character at 2: '2'\n                tmp = 2 * 1 mod 2019 = 2\n                since i=1 (first iteration) -> no previous\n                mod_arr(1)=2\n                mod_cnt[2] becomes 1\n                radix = 10 mod 2019 = 10\n\n            i=2:\n                j = 2-2+1 = 1 -> character at 1: '1'\n                tmp = 1 * 10 mod 2019 = 10\n                then add mod_arr(1) = 2 -> 10+2 = 12 mod 2019 = 12\n                mod_arr(2)=12\n                mod_cnt[12] becomes 1\n                radix = 10*10 mod 2019 = 100\n\n            Then mod_cnt[0] becomes 1 (so mod_cnt[0]=1, others: mod_cnt[2]=1, mod_cnt[12]=1)\n\n            ans = 0\n            for mod_cnt[0]: 1 -> 1*0/2 = 0\n            for mod_cnt[2]: 1 -> 0\n            for mod_cnt[12]: 1 -> 0\n            then mod_cnt[0] was increased: so we have mod_cnt[0]=1 -> 0\n            so ans=0\n\n            Then S2 = \"0\"\n\n            Then the third program: \n                S2 = \"0\"\n                then S3 = \"0\"\n\n            Output: \"0\"\n\n        What is the expected? The second program counts the number of substrings divisible by 2019. The string \"12\" has substrings: \n            \"1\" -> 1 mod2019=1 -> not 0\n            \"2\" -> 2 mod2019=2 -> not 0\n            \"12\" -> 12 mod2019=12 -> not 0\n            So 0 substrings.\n\n        Then the third program outputs \"0\".\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious about the indices and mod arithmetic.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: MOD = 2019   ! for clarity\n\n   And in the mod_arr loop:\n\n        tmp = mod( (digit * radix), MOD)\n        if (i>1) then   ! because i=1 is the first\n            tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), MOD)\n        end if\n\n   Also, note: the radix is updated by multiplying by 10 mod MOD.\n\n   We must use nonnegative mod? Fortran mod is nonnegative.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        tmp = mod(digit * radix, MOD)\n        if (i>1) tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), MOD)\n\n   Then set mod_arr(i)=tmp.\n\n   And update the frequency.\n\n   We'll use integer*4 for mod_arr and mod_cnt? But the mod_arr values are in [0,2018]. And mod_cnt is an array of 2019 integers.\n\n   The variable `ans` must be integer*8 to avoid overflow? Because mod_cnt[i] can be large? The string length n can be up to 200000 (from the first program: n is the first integer). The mod_cnt[i] can be up to n? Then mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 can be about 20e10, which fits in 64-bit integer.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n   But note: the first program: n can be up to 100? The original first program: the constraints are not given. But the second program is from atcoder and the constraints for the string are up to 200000. However, in our chain the string S1 has length n (from the first program). The first program: n, a, b are read. The constraints? We don't know. We assume n can be large? \n\n   But the problem says: the entire sequence. We must handle the same inputs as the original chain.\n\n   We'll assume that the first program's n can be large? \n\n   We'll allocate mod_arr for up to 200000? But the first program: n is the first integer. We read it, and then we build a string of n characters.\n\n   We must be efficient.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n, a, b.\n        Allocate list1(a), list2(b).\n        Read list1, list2.\n\n        Build S1: by looping from 1 to n. We do n appends? But n can be 200000? Then building a string by concatenation in a loop is O(n^2). \n\n        We can preallocate S1 to n characters and assign each character.\n\n        Better:\n\n            character(len=n) :: S1_str\n            do i=1, n\n                if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                    S1_str(i:i) = '1'\n                else\n                    S1_str(i:i) = '2'\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then S1 = S1_str   (if we want an allocatable string we can set)\n\n        But we can use S1_str in the next step.\n\n     5. Then the second program: we need the length n (which we have as n, and also len(S1_str)=n).\n\n        We'll set N1 = n.\n\n        Then allocate mod_arr(N1)   ! size N1.\n\n        Then the loop for i=1 to N1.\n\n        We must be cautious: the first program's n is the same as the length of the string.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Let's write the entire Fortran program.\n\n   Note: We must use integer*8 for `ans` and also for the intermediate multiplications? \n\n        mod_cnt[i] is integer*4, but when we compute mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2, we do:\n\n            ans = ans + int(mod_cnt(i),8) * int(mod_cnt(i)-1,8) / 2\n\n        But integer division? The original uses integer division (because it's long). \n\n        We can do: \n\n            ans = ans + (int(mod_cnt(i),8) * (int(mod_cnt(i),8)-1_8)) / 2\n\n        But note: mod_cnt(i) is nonnegative, and the product is even? Yes, because it's a binomial coefficient.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        do i=0, MOD-1\n            if (mod_cnt(i) < 2) cycle\n            nci = int(mod_cnt(i), 8)   ! convert to int64\n            ans = ans + nci*(nci-1_8)/2_8\n        end do\n\n   But note: the division by 2 must be integer division. Since nci*(nci-1) is even, it's safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do integer division: but Fortran integer division truncates. \n\n        nci*(nci-1)/2   is integer.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        ans = ans + nci*(nci-1_8)/2_8\n\n   But nci*(nci-1_8) might be large? But the maximum nci is n (which is the string length, and the string length can be up to 200000). Then 200000*199999/2 = 19999900000, which fits in int64.\n\n   So we do.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let's code.\n\n   Note: We must use modules? But we are writing a single main program.\n\n   We'll write everything in the main program.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        ! ... declarations ...\n\n        ! Read first input\n        read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n        ! ... rest ...\n\n   We'll assume the inputs are integers.\n\n   We must be cautious: the first program reads integers, and the lists of integers.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        integer :: n, a, b\n        integer, allocatable, dimension(:) :: list1, list2\n        integer :: i, j, tmp, radix, N1, MODVAL\n        integer, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n        integer, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans, nci\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: S1, S2, S3\n        character(len=20) :: temp\n        character(len=1) :: c\n        integer :: len_s2, k\n\n        MODVAL = 2019\n\n        !

Step 2: allocate and read list1 and list2\n        allocate(list1(a), list2(b))\n        do i=1, a\n            read(*,*) list1(i)\n        end do\n        do i=1, b\n            read(*,*) list2(i)\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 3: Build S1 (string of length n)\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: S1)\n        do i=1, n\n            if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                S1(i:i) = '1'\n            else\n                S1(i:i) = '2'\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 4: Run the second program on S1\n        N1 = len(S1)\n        allocate(mod_arr(N1))\n        mod_arr = 0\n        mod_cnt = 0\n        radix = 1\n\n        do i=1, N1\n            ! j is the index from the end: we want the (N1 - i + 1)-th character\n            j = N1 - i + 1\n            ! Convert character to digit\n            read(S1(j:j), *) tmp   ! This works? The substring is one character. Alternatively:\n            ! But we know it's a digit. We can do: \n            !   tmp = ichar(S1(j:j)) - 48   ! 48 is ichar('0')\n            ! Let's use the latter to avoid read.\n            tmp = ichar(S1(j:j)) - ichar('0')\n            tmp = mod(tmp * radix, MODVAL)\n\n            if (i > 1) then\n                tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), MODVAL)\n            end if\n\n            mod_arr(i) = tmp\n            mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n\n            radix = mod(radix * 10, MODVAL)\n        end do\n\n        mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n\n        ans = 0_8\n        do i=0, MODVAL-1\n            if (mod_cnt(i) < 2) cycle\n            nci = int(mod_cnt(i), 8)\n            ans = ans + nci * (nci - 1_8) / 2_8\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 5: Convert ans to string S2\n        write(temp, '(I0)') ans\n        S2 = trim(temp)\n\n        ! Step 6: Process S2 for the third program\n        S3 = ''\n        do i=1, len(S2)\n            c = S2(i:i)\n            if (c == '0') then\n                S3 = S3 // '0'\n            else if (c == '1') then\n                S3 = S3 // '1'\n            else if (c == 'B') then\n                if (len(S3) > 0) then\n                    S3 = S3(1:len(S3)-1)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 7: Output S3\n        write(*, '(A)') S3\n\n        end program\n\n   But note: the string S3 might be empty? Then we write an empty line.\n\n   This matches the expected behavior.\n\n   However, there are potential issues:\n\n      - The first program: the condition `any(list1 == i)` might be inefficient for large a and n? But a and n are not specified. We assume a is not too large (like 100). But if a is 100000, then we need a better method.\n\n        We can create a boolean array for indices 1..n:\n\n            logical, dimension(:), allocatable :: in_list1\n            allocate(in_list1(n))\n            in_list1 = .false.\n            do i=1, a\n                if (list1(i) >=1 .and. list1(i)<=n) then\n                    in_list1(list1(i)) = .true.\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then when building S1:\n\n            do i=1, n\n                if (in_list1(i)) then\n                    S1(i:i) = '1'\n                else\n                    S1(i:i) = '2'\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        This is O(n+a) which is efficient.\n\n      - The second program: we are storing the entire mod_arr of length n?

Third program: \n        S3 = ''\n        do i=1, len(S2)\n            c = S2(i:i)\n            if (c == '0') then\n                S3 = S3 // '0'\n            else if (c == '1') then\n                S3 = S3 // '1'\n            else if (c == 'B') then\n                if (len(S3) > 0) then\n                    S3 = S3(1:len(S3)-1)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        write(*, '(A)') S3\n\n        end program combined\n\n   We'll test with the example above.\n\n   But note: the second program uses 0-indexed mod_arr? We are using 1-indexed arrays.\n\n   The algorithm is the same.\n\n   We hope it works.\n\n   We note: the third program might be redundant? But we include it.\n\n   We output the final string.\n\n   This is the complete Fortran program."
