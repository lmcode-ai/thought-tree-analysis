Steps for the entire Fortran program:\n\n     1. Read the integer t.\n     2. If t>=1, read the first integer n0. Then read the next t-1 integers (we don't use them, but we read them to consume the input). 3. Compute m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n     4. Convert m0 to a string and extract the first character, c0. 5. Compute c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n     6. Try to convert the character c1 to an integer (call it n_val). If the conversion fails, then we stop without writing any output (for the third program). 7. Otherwise, compute:\n            ans = 0\n            do i = 1, n_val\n                term1 = i\n                term2 = n_val / i   ! integer division\n                term3 = term2 * (term2+1) / 2\n                ans = ans + term1 * term3\n            end do\n        But note: the Java code does:\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n        Actually, we can rewrite:\n\n            term = (n_val / i) [integer division]\n            term2 = term * (term+1) / 2\n            then add i * term2\n\n        But note: the multiplication by i and then by the term2? Actually:\n\n            term = n_val / i   (integer division) Then the expression: i * term * (term+1) / 2\n\n        But the Java code does: i * (term * (term+1) / 2) So we can do:\n\n            term = n_val / i\n            temp = term * (term+1) / 2\n            ans = ans + i * temp However, note: the division by 2: in Java, it is integer division. And the expression is computed as:\n\n            (i * term * (term+1)) / 2   ? But the Java code does:\n\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n        The operations are from left to right? But multiplication and division are left associative. So:\n\n            ( (i * (n/i)) * ((n/i)+1) ) / 2\n\n        But note: the factors: i * (n/i) is not necessarily n? Because integer division: n = q*i + r, then n/i = q. So i*q = i*(n/i) <= n.\n\n        Actually, we can rewrite the inner part:\n\n            Let k = n /",

Therefore, n_val is between 1 and 9? Actually, if m0=0, then c0='0', then c1='1', then n_val=1. So the loop runs for n_val from 1 to 9. So the maximum n_val is 9. Then the loop runs 9 times. And k = n_val / i: for i=1..9. This is safe. But wait: what if m0=0? Then we get n_val=1. Then the third program computes:\n\n        for i=1 to 1: \n            k = 1/1 = 1\n            temp = 1*2/2 = 1\n            ans = 1\n\n        output 1. Example: if the input to the chain is:\n        t=1\n        n0=3   -> m0 = 1 -> string \"1\" -> c0='1' -> c1='2' -> n_val=2. Then the third program: \n            i=1: k=2/1=2 -> temp=2*3/2=3 -> ans += 1*3 = 3.\n            i=2: k=2/2=1 -> temp=1*2/2=1 -> ans += 2*1 = 2 -> total 5. Output 5. So the Fortran program must output 5. Therefore, we can write the program as described.",

So this matches. Let's test with the example: Input: \n            1\n            3\n\n        Step1: m0 = 1 -> string \"1\" -> c0='1' -> c1='2' -> n_val=2. Step2: compute for n_val=2:\n\n            i=1: k = 2/1 = 2 -> temp = 2*3/2 = 3 -> ans += 1*3 = 3.\n            i=2: k = 2/2 = 1 -> temp = 1*2/2 = 1 -> ans += 2*1 = 2 -> total 5.\n\n        Output: 5\n\n   So the Fortran program should output \"5\" (without quotes) and then a newline. Therefore, the final program:\n\n      program main\n      implicit none\n      integer(kind=8) :: t, n0, i, m0, n_val, ans, k, temp, discard\n      character(len=50) :: str\n      character :: c0, c1\n      integer :: ios\n\n      read(*,*) t\n\n      if (t >= 1) then\n          read(*,*) n0\n      else\n          n0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      do i = 2, t\n          read(*,*) discard\n      end do\n\n      if (n0 > 2) then\n          m0 = n0 - 2\n      else\n          m0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      write(str, '(I0)') m0\n      c0 = str(1:1)\n      c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1) str = c1\n\n      read(str, *, iostat=ios) n_val\n\n      if (ios == 0) then\n          ans = 0\n          do i = 1, n_val\n              k = n_val / i\n              temp = k * (k+1) / 2\n              ans = ans + i * temp\n          end do\n          write(*, '(I0)') ans\n      end if\n\n      end program\n\n   Note: We use kind=8 for all integers to be consistent with Java's long. But the numbers are small. However, for consistency, we keep kind=8. Also note: the variable `i` in the loop for reading the remaining integers and the loop for the third program are different? We use the same name? But the loops are separate. We can reuse. This program should behave identically to the chain when run on the same input. Let me test with:\n\n        Input: \n            1\n            0\n\n        Then n0=0 -> m0=0 -> string \"0\" -> c0='0' -> c1='1' -> n_val=1. Then the third program: \n            i=1: k = 1/1=1 -> temp = 1*2/2=1 -> ans=1*1=1. Output: 1.\n\n   Another test: Input: \n            1\n            5\n\n        m0=3 -> string \"3\" -> c0='3' -> c1='4' -> n_val=4. Then the third program:\n\n            i=1: k=4/1=4 -> temp=4*5/2=10 -> ans += 1*10 = 10.\n            i=2: k=4/2=2 -> temp=2*3/2=3 -> ans += 2*3=6 -> 16.\n            i=3: k=4/3=1 -> temp=1*2/2=1 -> ans += 3*1=3 -> 19. i=4: k=4/4=1 -> temp=1 -> ans += 4*1=4 -> 23. Output: 23. The original third program for n=4:\n\n        ans = 0\n        i=1: 1 * (4/1) * (4/1+1)/2 = 1 * 4 * 5/2 = 1 * 4 * 2.5 -> but integer division: 4 * 5 / 2 = 20/2=10 -> 10\n        i=2: 2 * (4/2) * (4/2+1)/2 = 2 * 2 * 3/2 = 2 * 2 * 1 (because 3/2=1 in integer) -> 2*2*1=4 -> wait, but the expression is: (2 * 2 * 3) / 2 = 12/2=6 -> 6\n        i=3: 3 * (4/3) * (4/3+1)/2 = 3 * 1 * (1+1)/2 = 3 * 1 * 2/2 = 3*1*1=3\n        i=4: 4 * (4/4) * (4/4+1)/2 = 4 * 1 * (1+1)/2 = 4 * 1 * 2/2 = 4*1*1=4\n        total: 10+6+3+4=23. So it matches. Therefore, we write the Fortran program as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs that are to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (codeforces_23_B) reads an integer `t`, then for each test case it reads an integer `n` and outputs the result of `maxLeft(n)`, which is `max(0, n-2)`.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a single string (or a line) and then outputs the next character (by taking the first character and adding 1 to it). But note: the output of the first program is a sequence of integers (each on a new line). The second program expects a single string (one line). So we must consider how the output of the first is transformed to the input of the second.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs multiple lines (if `t`>1). The second program only reads one line. This suggests that the chain is intended to be run on a single test case? However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This implies that the entire output of the first program is fed as the input to the second, and then the entire output of the second is fed to the third.\n\nBut the second program only reads one line. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program would only take the first line? Then the third program would read the output of the second (a single character) and try to convert it to an integer? This doesn't seem to align with the third program which reads a single integer.\n\nTherefore, we must reexamine the chain:\n\n1. The first program: \n   - Input: first integer `t` (number of test cases), then `t` integers `n`.\n   - Output: for each `n`, outputs one integer (result of `maxLeft(n)`) on a separate line.\n\n2. The second program:\n   - Input: one line (from stdin). It reads the entire line and then takes the first character, adds 1 to it, and prints that character.\n\n3. The third program:\n   - Input: one integer.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is multiple integers (each on a new line). The second program only uses the first line. Then the third program expects one integer.\n\nSo the chain is:\n\nInput for the entire chain: the same input as the first program (a number `t` and `t` integers).\n\nThen the first program runs and produces `t` lines of integers.\n\nThe second program takes the first line of that output (the first integer) and converts it to a character and then outputs the next character.\n\nExample: if the first integer output by the first program is 65 (which is the ASCII for 'A'), then the second program would output 'B'. But note: the output of the first program is an integer, so if we output 65, that is the string \"65\" (two characters: '6' and '5'). The second program takes the first character of the first line. So if the first line is \"65\", then the first character is '6'. Then adding 1 to '6' gives '7'. So the second program outputs '7'.\n\nThen the third program reads that single character? But the third program uses `sc.nextInt()`. So it expects an integer. If we give it the character '7', then `nextInt()` would read the integer 7.\n\nBut note: the third program then does a computation for an input `n=7`.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n1. First program: reads `t` and `t` numbers. For each number `n`, outputs `max(0, n-2)`. Let the first number in the input be `n0`, then the first output line is `max(0, n0-2)`.\n\n2. Second program: reads the first line of the output of the first program (which is the string representation of `max(0, n0-2)`). Then it takes the first character of that string and outputs the next ASCII character.\n\n3. Third program: reads that single character (as a string) and then tries to parse it as an integer? But note: the output of the second program is a single character (without a newline? or with a newline? the second program uses `printf` without a newline). Actually, the second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which does not append a newline. However, the third program uses `Scanner` which by default uses whitespace as delimiters. So if the second program outputs a single character without a newline, then the third program's `nextInt()` might fail because there's no integer token (unless that character is a digit and then there's an end of input?).\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". We must consider the entire output of the second program as the input to the third. The third program expects an integer. However, the second program outputs a single character. If that character is a digit, then the third program can read it as an integer? Actually, the `Scanner` would read a token of one digit and convert it to an integer. But if the first program's output for the first test case was a number with multiple digits, the second program only uses the first digit? Then the second program outputs the next character of that first digit.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is a sequence of integers. The second program only reads the first line. The third program only reads one token (the first token from the second program's output). So the chain effectively:\n\n- The entire chain input: \n   t\n   n0\n   n1\n   ... \n   n_{t-1}\n\n- The first program outputs t lines: \n   m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n   m1 = max(0, n1-2)\n   ...\n\n- The second program takes the first line (the string of m0) and then takes the first character of that string (say c0) and outputs the character (c0+1).\n\n- The third program reads the output of the second program (a string of one character) and then uses that character (converted to an integer) as the value for `n` in its own program.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain output is the output of the third program: a single integer computed as:\n\n   Let x = the first character of the string representation of max(0, n0-2)   [which is the first output of the first program]\n   Then the input to the third program is the integer value of the character (x+1) ??? \n\nBut wait: the second program does: `s.charAt(0) + 1` and then prints the character corresponding to that code. So if the first character is '6', then it becomes 55 (if we do '6' is 54, then 54+1=55, which is '7'). Then the third program reads the string \"7\" and converts to integer 7.\n\nBut note: what if the first output of the first program is a negative number? Actually, `max(0, n0-2)` is nonnegative. So the string representation is either \"0\" or a positive integer (which may have multiple digits). The second program takes the first character. So:\n\n   If m0 is 0 -> string \"0\" -> first char '0' -> then output char '1' (because '0'+1 is 49, which is the character '1').\n   Then the third program would read the string \"1\" and get the integer 1.\n\n   If m0 is 10 -> string \"10\" -> first char '1' -> then output char '2'. Then the third program gets integer 2.\n\n   If m0 is 123 -> first char '1' -> output '2', third program gets 2.\n\nSo the input to the third program is the integer value of the digit that is the first character of the first output line of the first program incremented by 1 (as a character) and then converted back to a digit? Actually, the third program reads the character output by the second program and then converts that entire token (which is one character) to an integer. But note: the character is a digit? It can be any character? Actually, the output of the first program is nonnegative integers. The string representation of a nonnegative integer is composed of digits. So the first character is a digit. Then the second program outputs the next digit? But wait: if the digit is '9', then adding 1 gives 58, which is ':'. Then the third program would try to parse ':' as an integer? That would fail. But note: the first program outputs numbers that are at least 0. The maximum value of the first digit? The number can be arbitrarily large, but the first digit can be from '1' to '9' (if the number is 0, then it's '0'). So:\n\n   If the first digit is '0' -> output '1' -> integer 1.\n   If the first digit is '1' to '8' -> output the next digit (so '2' to '9') -> integer 2 to 9.\n   If the first digit is '9' -> output ':' -> which is not a digit. Then the third program would throw an exception? But we must produce a Fortran program that behaves identically? However, the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So we must assume that the input is such that the first output of the first program has a first digit that is not '9'? Or we must handle it?\n\nBut note: the first program outputs `max(0, n0-2)`. The value of n0 is given. The smallest value is 0 (then output 0). The next is 1 -> output 0, 2 -> output 0, 3 -> output 1, 4 -> output 2, ... and so on. So the output of the first program for the first test case is a nonnegative integer. The string representation of that integer has a first digit that is between '0' and '9'. But if the number is 90, then the first digit is '9'. Then the second program outputs ':'. The third program would fail. \n\nHowever, the original chain would also fail in the third program in that case. So we must replicate that behavior? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So the Fortran program should also fail? But Fortran does not have exceptions in the same way. We can try to read a character and then convert to integer? But if the character is not a digit, we get an error.\n\nAlternatively, we can note: the problem says the entire chain. We are to write one Fortran program that does the same.\n\nBut note: the chain is:\n\n   Input: t and t integers.\n\n   Step1: compute for each integer n_i: m_i = max(0, n_i-2). We only care about the first line of the output of step1 for step2.\n\n   Step2: take the first line (the string of m0) and extract its first character, then compute the next character.\n\n   Step3: take that character and use it as the input integer? But note: the third program expects an integer. The second program outputs a character. The third program uses `nextInt()`, which would read the integer from the token. But the token is a single non-digit? Then it would crash.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to write a Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So we can do:\n\n   We are to read the same input: t and then t integers.\n\n   Then we compute the first output: m0 = max(0, n0-2). We then convert m0 to a string and take the first character. Then we compute the next character (by adding 1 to the character code). Then we convert that character to a string and then try to read an integer from that string? But if the character is not a digit, we cannot read an integer? Then we must output the same as the third program? The third program would output the result of a computation for an integer n that is read. But if the read fails, it would throw an exception and output nothing? We cannot do that in Fortran? Alternatively, we can note that the third program only runs if the second program outputs a digit? But the problem does not specify constraints on the input. However, note that the first program's output for the first test case is m0. The string representation of m0 is a nonnegative integer. The first character is a digit? Actually, yes, because nonnegative integers in base 10 are represented by digits. So the first character is a digit. Then the next character is the next digit? But wait: the next digit in the sequence of digits? No, the next character in the ASCII table. So:\n\n   '0' -> 48 -> 48+1=49 -> '1'\n   '1' -> 49 -> 50 -> '2'\n   ...\n   '9' -> 57 -> 58 -> ':'\n\nBut the third program expects a digit? Then if we get a non-digit, it fails. However, note that the first digit of m0 can only be from '0' to '9'. But if m0 is 90, then the first digit is '9', then the next character is ':' which is not a digit. Then the third program fails.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can avoid that by converting the character to its ASCII value and then subtracting 48 to get the digit? But wait: the third program does not do that. The third program uses `nextInt()` on the token. The token is the character output by the second program. So if the second program outputs a single character that is a digit, then `nextInt()` reads the integer value of that digit. If it outputs a non-digit, then `nextInt()` fails.\n\nTherefore, we must design the Fortran program to:\n\n   Step 1: Read t and then t integers. We only care about the first integer (n0) for the rest of the chain? But note: the first program outputs all the integers. However, the second program only uses the first line. The third program only uses the output of the second program. So we can ignore the rest of the test cases? Actually, no: the first program must output all the results. But the second program only reads the first line. The third program then starts reading after that? But the entire output of the first program is:\n\n   m0\n   m1\n   ...\n   m_{t-1}\n\n   Then the second program reads the first line (m0) and outputs one character. Then the third program reads that one character (as a token). The rest of the output of the first program (m1 to m_{t-1}) is still in the buffer? But the second program only reads one line. The third program then reads the next token (which is the character output by the second program) and then ignores the rest? \n\nBut the third program only reads one integer. So the entire chain output is the output of the third program: one integer.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n   - Read the integer t.\n   - Read the first integer n0 (and the rest of the integers if t>1, but we only need n0 for the chain, but we must also compute the rest for the first program? Actually, the first program outputs all the results. However, the chain only uses the first output line for the second program. But the first program must be emulated: it outputs all the results? But the problem says: \"without I/O\" in the intermediate steps. And the output of the entire chain is the output of the third program.\n\n   However, note: the original chain produces the entire output of the first program and then the second program reads the first line of that. Then the third program runs and produces one integer. The entire output of the chain is the output of the third program? But what about the rest of the output of the first program? It is not consumed by the second program? The second program only reads the first line. Then the third program reads the next token (which is the output of the second program). The rest of the output of the first program (the remaining lines) are still in the buffer? But the third program doesn't read them. So they are lost? Then the entire chain output is the single integer from the third program.\n\n   Therefore, we can ignore the rest of the test cases beyond the first? But note: the first program must run for all test cases because the problem says \"behaves identically\". However, the chain behavior is defined by the outputs that are passed. The second program only uses the first line. The third program uses the output of the second. The rest of the output of the first program is not used. But if we are to write a single Fortran program, we can skip the computation for the other test cases? Actually, no: the first program does compute for all test cases. But we don't use the rest. However, we are not allowed to do I/O in the intermediate steps. So we must compute all the outputs of the first program, but we only need the first one for the chain.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". So we must compute the same as the first program for all test cases? But we are not going to output them. We are only going to use the first one for the next step.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n   Step 1: Read the number of test cases, t.\n   Step 2: Read the first integer n0. Then we can read the rest of the integers (if any) and compute the maxLeft for each, but we only need the first one for the chain.\n\n   However, to be identical, we must compute the maxLeft for all? But the problem does not require the intermediate outputs to be printed. So we can compute only the first one? Because the rest are not used in the chain? The chain only uses the first output line.\n\n   So we can:\n\n      read t\n      read n0\n      for i = 2 to t\n          read and discard (or store but not use) the next integer? But we don't need them for the chain? But the first program must compute the maxLeft for each. However, the problem says we are to reproduce the same behavior. The behavior of the first program is to output maxLeft for each. But in the chain, only the first is used. The rest are ignored. So we can skip reading the rest? Actually, no: the input has t integers. We must read them? Otherwise, the Fortran program would leave unread data? Then the behavior is not identical? The original first program reads all the integers.\n\n   So we must read all the integers? But we don't use them. So:\n\n      read t\n      read n0\n      if t>1, then read the next t-1 integers (we don't need them for the chain, but we must read to consume the input).\n\n   Then:\n\n      Step A: compute m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n      Step B: convert m0 to a string and take the first character (call it c0)\n      Step C: compute c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n      Step D: convert c1 to an integer? But note: the third program uses the output of the second program (a character) as an integer. How? The third program uses `nextInt()`. The `Scanner` would read the next token. The token is the string of one character. Then it parses that string to an integer. So if the character is '7', then the integer is 7. But if the character is 'A', it would fail.\n\n   How to convert the character to an integer? We can do: the integer value of the character is the digit it represents? But note: the character is not necessarily a digit? We have established that the first character of the string representation of m0 is a digit? Yes, because m0 is nonnegative. Then the next character (c1) is the next digit? Actually, the next ASCII character. But if the digit is '0'..'9', then the next character is '1'..':'. The characters '1'..'9' are digits, but ':' is not. So for the case when c0='9', we get c1=':'. Then the third program fails.\n\n   Therefore, in Fortran, we can:\n\n      - Convert m0 to a string (character array) and take the first character.\n      - Compute the next character: c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n      - Then, if c1 is a digit, convert it to an integer. But the third program does that? But the third program would fail if it's not a digit. In Fortran, we can use an internal read. If it fails, we must handle? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if the original chain fails (throws an exception) then the Fortran program should also fail? But Fortran doesn't throw exceptions. We can set an error code? Or we can output nothing? Or we can let the runtime error? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the behavior on invalid input. We must assume that the input is such that the entire chain runs without error? But the example input might have n0 such that m0 has a first digit that is not '9'. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the third program does not require the input to be a single character? It requires an integer. The second program outputs a single character. The third program reads that character and then tries to parse it as an integer. So if the character is not a digit, the parsing fails. In Fortran, we can do:\n\n      read(c1, *, iostat=ios) n_third\n\n   If ios is not zero, then we have an error. Then we can stop the program? Because the original Java would throw an exception and stop.\n\n   But the problem says: the entire chain. So we can do:\n\n      if the character c1 is not a digit, then we might output nothing? and stop? \n\n   However, the third program in Java would output nothing and terminate with an exception. In Fortran, we can terminate with an error message? But the problem says \"behaves identically\", meaning the same output. So if the third program in Java outputs nothing, then the Fortran program should output nothing? And if it does output, then output the same integer.\n\n   Therefore, we can:\n\n      if c1 is a digit (i.e., between '0' and '9') then convert to integer and then compute the third program's function with that integer and output the result.\n\n      else: output nothing? and terminate? But the original third program would output nothing? Actually, it would throw an exception and not output the answer. So we can do:\n\n          if the conversion fails, then we do nothing? but the problem requires the entire chain to be in one program. We can use an internal read and if it fails, we just stop without output? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the input n0 must be such that the first digit of m0 is not '9'. But the problem does not guarantee that. So we must handle the error.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input causes the chain to fail, the Fortran program should also fail. We can do:\n\n      Attempt to read from the string of c1 to an integer. If it fails, we stop without output? But the third program in Java would output an error to stderr? We don't have to worry about stderr? The problem says \"producing output\" meaning stdout. So if the third program doesn't print to stdout, then we don't print.\n\n   So:\n\n      We try to convert the character c1 to an integer. If we can, then we compute the third program's function with that integer and output the result.\n\n      If we cannot (because the character is not a digit), then we output nothing and stop? \n\n   But the third program in Java does:\n\n        int n = sc.nextInt();   // if this fails, it throws an exception and the next computation and output are skipped.\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   Now, the third program's function:\n\n        long ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n        }\n\n   We can write this in Fortran.\n\n   Steps for the entire Fortran program:\n\n     1. Read the integer t.\n     2. If t>=1, read the first integer n0. Then read the next t-1 integers (we don't use them, but we read them to consume the input).\n     3. Compute m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n     4. Convert m0 to a string and extract the first character, c0.\n     5. Compute c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n     6. Try to convert the character c1 to an integer (call it n_val). If the conversion fails, then we stop without writing any output (for the third program).\n     7. Otherwise, compute:\n            ans = 0\n            do i = 1, n_val\n                term1 = i\n                term2 = n_val / i   ! integer division\n                term3 = term2 * (term2+1) / 2\n                ans = ans + term1 * term3\n            end do\n        But note: the Java code does:\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n        Actually, we can rewrite:\n\n            term = (n_val / i)   [integer division]\n            term2 = term * (term+1) / 2\n            then add i * term2\n\n        But note: the multiplication by i and then by the term2? Actually:\n\n            term = n_val / i   (integer division)\n            Then the expression: i * term * (term+1) / 2\n\n        But the Java code does: i * (term * (term+1) / 2)\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            term = n_val / i\n            temp = term * (term+1) / 2\n            ans = ans + i * temp\n\n        However, note: the division by 2: in Java, it is integer division. And the expression is computed as:\n\n            (i * term * (term+1)) / 2   ? \n\n        But the Java code does:\n\n            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\n        The operations are from left to right? But multiplication and division are left associative. So:\n\n            ( (i * (n/i)) * ((n/i)+1) ) / 2\n\n        But note: the factors: i * (n/i) is not necessarily n? Because integer division: n = q*i + r, then n/i = q. So i*q = i*(n/i) <= n.\n\n        Actually, we can rewrite the inner part:\n\n            Let k = n / i   (floor division)\n            Then the term is: i * k * (k+1) / 2\n\n        So the inner term is: i * k*(k+1)/2.\n\n        But note: k*(k+1)/2 is the triangular number for k. Then multiplied by i.\n\n        So we can compute:\n\n            k = n_val / i\n            triangular = k*(k+1)/2   (this is an integer if k is even or k+1 is even? yes, because consecutive integers)\n            then add i * triangular\n\n        However, we must use integer arithmetic and be cautious of overflow. The Java code uses long. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for large integers.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     - We'll use integer(kind=8) for all integers to avoid overflow.\n\n   Summary of the Fortran program:\n\n     program main\n        implicit none\n        integer(kind=8) :: t, n0, i, j, m0, n_val, ans, temp, k, discard\n        character(len=20) :: str   ! enough to hold an integer\n        character :: c0, c1\n        integer :: ios\n\n        ! Read the number of test cases\n        read(*,*) t\n\n        ! Read the first integer\n        if (t >= 1) then\n            read(*,*) n0\n        else\n            n0 = 0\n        end if\n\n        ! Read the remaining t-1 integers (if any) and discard\n        do i = 2, t\n            read(*,*) discard\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 1: compute m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n        if (n0 > 2) then\n            m0 = n0 - 2\n        else\n            m0 = 0\n        end if\n\n        ! Convert m0 to a string\n        write(str, '(I0)') m0   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces\n\n        ! Extract the first character\n        c0 = str(1:1)\n\n        ! Compute the next character\n        c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n\n        ! Now, try to convert c1 to an integer\n        ! We'll read from a string that contains only c1\n        str = c1   ! now str(1:1)=c1, and we can read the first integer token from str\n        read(str, *, iostat=ios) n_val\n\n        if (ios /= 0) then\n            ! Conversion failed: we stop without output? \n            ! Since the third program would throw an exception and not output, we do nothing.\n            ! But note: the problem says \"only the last block should handle producing output\", so we don't output anything.\n            stop\n        else\n            ! Now we run the third program's computation with n = n_val\n            ans = 0\n            do i = 1, n_val\n                k = n_val / i   ! integer division (same as in Java)\n                ! Compute triangular number for k: k*(k+1)/2\n                temp = k * (k+1) / 2\n                ans = ans + i * temp\n            end do\n            ! Output the answer (as the last block)\n            write(*,*) ans\n        end if\n\n     end program\n\n   However, note: the third program uses `long` for `ans` and `i` and `n`. We use integer(kind=8). The division in Fortran for integers is truncation towards zero? But note: in Java, division for nonnegative integers is the same as truncation towards zero? Actually, for nonnegative, it's the same as floor. So for nonnegative integers, truncation and floor are the same.\n\n   But note: the expression `k*(k+1)/2`: if k is large, then k*(k+1) might overflow a 32-bit integer? But we are using 64-bit integers. The problem says the input to the third program is a single digit? Actually, no: the input to the third program is the integer converted from a single character. So n_val is between 0 and 9? Actually, wait: the character we read is from '1' to ':'? But we only convert if it is a digit. The digits are from '0' to '9'. Then n_val is an integer between 0 and 9? \n\n   But note: the second program outputs the next character. We convert that character to an integer only if it is a digit. The digits are from '0' to '9'. But the next character of a digit is the next digit? Not exactly: the next character in the ASCII table. But if the first character was a digit, then the next character might not be a digit? Only when the first digit is '0' to '8', the next character is '1' to '9' (which are digits). When the first digit is '9', the next is ':' (which is not a digit). So when we convert, n_val is in the range 1 to 9? Because:\n\n        c0: from '0' to '8' -> c1: from '1' to '9' -> n_val: 1 to 9.\n\n        and when c0='9', we don't convert.\n\n   Therefore, n_val is between 1 and 9? Actually, if m0=0, then c0='0', then c1='1', then n_val=1.\n\n   So the loop runs for n_val from 1 to 9. So the maximum n_val is 9. Then the loop runs 9 times. And k = n_val / i: for i=1..9. This is safe.\n\n   But wait: what if m0=0? Then we get n_val=1. Then the third program computes:\n\n        for i=1 to 1: \n            k = 1/1 = 1\n            temp = 1*2/2 = 1\n            ans = 1\n\n        output 1.\n\n   Example: if the input to the chain is:\n        t=1\n        n0=3   -> m0 = 1 -> string \"1\" -> c0='1' -> c1='2' -> n_val=2.\n\n        Then the third program: \n            i=1: k=2/1=2 -> temp=2*3/2=3 -> ans += 1*3 = 3.\n            i=2: k=2/2=1 -> temp=1*2/2=1 -> ans += 2*1 = 2 -> total 5.\n\n        Output 5.\n\n   So the Fortran program must output 5.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the program as described.\n\n   However, note: the second program in the chain (atcoder_ABC151_A) also includes a class `RemRing` which is not used in the main. We can ignore it.\n\n   Final Fortran program:\n\n   Note: We must use integer(kind=8) for all integers that might be involved in the computation? But the numbers are small (n_val<=9). But we use kind=8 for consistency.\n\n   But note: the input integers t and n0 might be large? The first program: n0 can be any integer. But we only use it to compute m0 (which is n0-2 if n0>2, else 0). Then we convert m0 to a string. The string representation of m0 might be long? But we only take the first character.\n\n   We read the remaining t-1 integers as discard (we use an integer(kind=8) for discard).\n\n   Code:\n\n      program main\n      implicit none\n      integer(kind=8) :: t, n0, i, m0, n_val, ans, k, temp, discard\n      character(len=50) :: str   ! enough for a large integer\n      character :: c0, c1\n      integer :: ios\n\n      ! Read the number of test cases\n      read(*,*) t\n\n      if (t >= 1) then\n          read(*,*) n0\n      else\n          n0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      ! Read the remaining integers (if any)\n      do i = 2, t\n          read(*,*) discard\n      end do\n\n      ! Compute m0 = max(0, n0-2)\n      if (n0 > 2) then\n          m0 = n0 - 2\n      else\n          m0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      ! Convert m0 to a string without leading spaces\n      write(str, '(I0)') m0\n\n      ! Extract the first character\n      c0 = str(1:1)\n\n      ! Compute the next character\n      c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n\n      ! Now, set str to be a string containing only c1\n      str = c1   ! This sets the first character to c1 and the rest to blanks? But we want to read one character as an integer.\n\n      ! Try to read n_val from the string\n      read(str, *, iostat=ios) n_val\n\n      if (ios /= 0) then\n          ! Conversion failed: output nothing and stop\n          stop\n      else\n          ! Compute the third program's function\n          ans = 0\n          do i = 1, n_val\n              k = n_val / i   ! integer division\n              temp = k * (k+1) / 2\n              ans = ans + i * temp\n          end do\n          write(*, '(I0)') ans   ! Output the integer without spaces\n      end if\n\n      end program\n\n   Note: The third program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? In Java: `System.out.println(ans);` which outputs the integer and then a newline. In Fortran, `write(*, '(I0)') ans` outputs the integer without leading spaces and without trailing space, but without a newline? Actually, the format I0 outputs the minimum width. Then we can do:\n\n        write(*, *) ans   ! This would output with a space? But we want exactly the integer and then a newline.\n\n   The problem says: the entire chain output is the output of the third program. The third program outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\n   So we can use:\n\n        write(*, *) ans   ! This uses list-directed formatting, which might add a space? But the problem does not specify the exact formatting? The original chain outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') ans\n\n   This outputs without any extra spaces and without a newline? Then we can:\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') ans\n        ! But then we need a newline? The original program outputs a newline.\n\n        write(*, *)   ! for a newline? But that would output a newline separately.\n\n   Actually, the format I0 does not include a newline. The list-directed write for an integer adds a newline? Actually, in Fortran, each write statement by default ends with a newline? \n\n   According to Fortran: non-advancing I/O is not the default. So:\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') ans   -> writes the integer and then a newline? \n\n   Actually, yes: the default behavior is to advance to the next line after the write.\n\n   But to be safe, we can do:\n\n        write(*, *) ans   ! This uses list-directed, which will output the integer and then a newline. The integer might be preceded by a space? \n\n   The problem does not require a specific formatting? The original Java outputs the integer in decimal and then a newline. So any formatting that outputs the integer and then a newline is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The same integer value.\n\n   So we can use either. Let's use list-directed to be simple.\n\n   But note: if the integer is negative? n_val is between 1 and 9, so positive.\n\n   So we can use:\n\n        write(*, *) ans\n\n   This outputs the integer with a leading space? But the problem doesn't specify. The original Java output has no space? It is the exact integer and then a newline.\n\n   To avoid the space, we use:\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') ans\n\n   This outputs without any space and then a newline.\n\n   Therefore, we use:\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') ans\n\n   But note: the output of the entire chain is the output of the third program. The third program outputs one integer and then a newline.\n\n   So this matches.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n        Input: \n            1\n            3\n\n        Step1: m0 = 1 -> string \"1\" -> c0='1' -> c1='2' -> n_val=2.\n\n        Step2: compute for n_val=2:\n\n            i=1: k = 2/1 = 2 -> temp = 2*3/2 = 3 -> ans += 1*3 = 3.\n            i=2: k = 2/2 = 1 -> temp = 1*2/2 = 1 -> ans += 2*1 = 2 -> total 5.\n\n        Output: 5\n\n   So the Fortran program should output \"5\" (without quotes) and then a newline.\n\n   Therefore, the final program:\n\n      program main\n      implicit none\n      integer(kind=8) :: t, n0, i, m0, n_val, ans, k, temp, discard\n      character(len=50) :: str\n      character :: c0, c1\n      integer :: ios\n\n      read(*,*) t\n\n      if (t >= 1) then\n          read(*,*) n0\n      else\n          n0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      do i = 2, t\n          read(*,*) discard\n      end do\n\n      if (n0 > 2) then\n          m0 = n0 - 2\n      else\n          m0 = 0\n      end if\n\n      write(str, '(I0)') m0\n      c0 = str(1:1)\n      c1 = char(ichar(c0)+1)\n      str = c1\n\n      read(str, *, iostat=ios) n_val\n\n      if (ios == 0) then\n          ans = 0\n          do i = 1, n_val\n              k = n_val / i\n              temp = k * (k+1) / 2\n              ans = ans + i * temp\n          end do\n          write(*, '(I0)') ans\n      end if\n\n      end program\n\n   Note: We use kind=8 for all integers to be consistent with Java's long. But the numbers are small. However, for consistency, we keep kind=8.\n\n   Also note: the variable `i` in the loop for reading the remaining integers and the loop for the third program are different? We use the same name? But the loops are separate. We can reuse.\n\n   This program should behave identically to the chain when run on the same input.\n\n   Let me test with:\n\n        Input: \n            1\n            0\n\n        Then n0=0 -> m0=0 -> string \"0\" -> c0='0' -> c1='1' -> n_val=1.\n\n        Then the third program: \n            i=1: k = 1/1=1 -> temp = 1*2/2=1 -> ans=1*1=1.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n   Another test: \n        Input: \n            1\n            5\n\n        m0=3 -> string \"3\" -> c0='3' -> c1='4' -> n_val=4.\n\n        Then the third program:\n\n            i=1: k=4/1=4 -> temp=4*5/2=10 -> ans += 1*10 = 10.\n            i=2: k=4/2=2 -> temp=2*3/2=3 -> ans += 2*3=6 -> 16.\n            i=3: k=4/3=1 -> temp=1*2/2=1 -> ans += 3*1=3 -> 19.\n            i=4: k=4/4=1 -> temp=1 -> ans += 4*1=4 -> 23.\n\n        Output: 23.\n\n   The original third program for n=4:\n\n        ans = 0\n        i=1: 1 * (4/1) * (4/1+1)/2 = 1 * 4 * 5/2 = 1 * 4 * 2.5 -> but integer division: 4 * 5 / 2 = 20/2=10 -> 10\n        i=2: 2 * (4/2) * (4/2+1)/2 = 2 * 2 * 3/2 = 2 * 2 * 1 (because 3/2=1 in integer) -> 2*2*1=4 -> wait, but the expression is: (2 * 2 * 3) / 2 = 12/2=6 -> 6\n        i=3: 3 * (4/3) * (4/3+1)/2 = 3 * 1 * (1+1)/2 = 3 * 1 * 2/2 = 3*1*1=3\n        i=4: 4 * (4/4) * (4/4+1)/2 = 4 * 1 * (1+1)/2 = 4 * 1 * 2/2 = 4*1*1=4\n        total: 10+6+3+4=23.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program as above."
