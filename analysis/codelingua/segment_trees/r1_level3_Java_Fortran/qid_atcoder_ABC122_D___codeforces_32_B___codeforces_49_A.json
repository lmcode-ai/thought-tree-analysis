Specifically:\n\n                            Check1: (a,b,c,d) -> check if (b,c,d) is not needed? we are checking the entire four for the substring \"AGC\". So we check: \n                                if (b==0 and c==2 and d==1) -> because A=0, G=2, C=1 -> then \"AGC\" is 0,2,1? But wait: \"AGC\" is A->0, G->2, C->1 -> so the consecutive triple starting at position1: (b,c,d) = (0,2,1) is \"AGC\"? Actually, the last4 is (a,b,c,d).

(all the variables) ...\n\n      integer :: n\n      integer(8) :: dp(0:100, 0:3, 0:3, 0:3)\n      integer(8) :: res1, total\n      integer :: i, a, b, c, d\n      character(len=20) :: str1   ! 20 to be safe for numbers up to 10^9 (10 digits)\n      integer :: str1_len\n      character(len=20) :: temp_str2  ! we'll build the second program's output here\n      integer :: out_len\n      logical :: s_flag\n      character(len=20) :: str3   ! for the third program input, we'll assign the output of the second\n      character :: last_char, ch\n      integer :: j\n      logical :: found\n\n      ! Read n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      ! Initialize dp\n      dp = 0\n      dp(0, 3, 3, 3) = 1\n\n      !

Convert res1 to a string in str1\n      write(str1, '(I0)') res1\n      str1_len = len_trim(str1)   ! get the length without trailing spaces\n\n      ! Now, run the second program on the string str1(1:str1_len)\n      out_len = 0\n      s_flag = .false. temp_str2 = ''   ! initialize\n\n      do i = 1, str1_len\n        if (str1(i:i) == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '1'\n                s_flag = .false. else\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '2'\n                s_flag = .false. else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n      end do\n\n      !

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first Java program (atcoder_ABC122_D) reads an integer N and then computes the number of valid DNA sequences of length N under certain constraints.\n 2. The second Java program (codeforces_32_B) reads a string of '.' and '-' and decodes it to a string of 0,1,2.\n 3. The third Java program (codeforces_49_A) reads a line and checks if the last non-space, non-question-mark character is a vowel (then prints \"YES\", else \"NO\").\n\n However, note that the instructions say:\n   - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n But the three programs are independent and are meant to be executed in sequence? Actually, the problem states:\n   \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n However, looking at the programs:\n   Program 1: reads an integer N, and outputs a single integer (the result of calc()).\n   Program 2: reads a string (which should be the output of program 1? but program 1 outputs an integer, and program 2 expects a string of '.' and '-' -> mismatch).\n\n This indicates that the programs are not designed to be chained in this way. \n\n But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n How the chain should work?\n   Input to the entire chain is the input for the first program? Then the output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and so on.\n\n However, the first program reads an integer, and the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. This is not compatible.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the three programs are independent and do not share a common data format? \n\n Actually, the example chain might not be intended to be run on the same input? The problem states: \"when run on the same input\" meaning the input to the entire chain.\n\n So the entire chain input is the integer for the first program? Then the output of the first program (a number) is fed as input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we have to design:\n\n   Read the input (which is the input for the first program) -> then run the first program's logic -> then use the output as input to the second program -> then run the second program's logic -> then use that output as input to the third program -> then output the result of the third.\n\n But the first program outputs a long integer, and the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. This is inconsistent.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the three programs are independent and the chain is not actually defined by the problem. However, the problem states they are executed in sequence with the output of one being the input of the next.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the example is flawed? But we are given three programs.\n\n Another possibility: the entire chain runs on a single input that is provided to the first program? Then the output of the first program is a string (the integer as a string) and that string is the input to the second program? \n\n The second program (codeforces_32_B) is designed to decode a string of '.' and '-'. If we give it the string representation of a number (which contains digits and possibly a minus sign?) it might not work.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact chain, I will assume that the input to the entire Fortran program is the same as the input to the first Java program (an integer) and then:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program (which computes a long integer result, call it `res1`).\n   Step 2: Convert `res1` to a string of digits. But note the second program expects '.' and '-'. This does not match.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? But that doesn't make sense because the second program expects a string and the first program outputs an integer.\n\n After re-examining the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n I think the intended chain is:\n\n   Input to the entire system is the input for the first program (an integer N).\n\n   The first program outputs a long integer (call it X). Then the second program is run with input being the string representation of X? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-' and will fail.\n\n This suggests that the chain is arbitrary and not designed to work together? \n\n Given the ambiguity, I will stick to the specification:\n\n   We have three programs that are run in sequence. The first reads an integer, the second reads a string, the third reads a line.\n\n   The entire Fortran program will:\n\n      Step 1: Read the integer (as the first program does).\n      Step 2: Run the logic of the first program to produce an integer result (call it `res1`).\n      Step 3: Convert `res1` to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) and use that string as the input to the second program.\n\n      Step 4: The second program (which originally reads a string of '.' and '-') will now get a string of digits (and possibly a minus sign if negative). However, the second program logic is designed for '.' and '-'. This will break.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the three programs are independent and the chain is not defined? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\".\n\n After reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And \"the same behavior\" meaning: if we run the three Java programs in sequence (with the output of the first as input to the second, and the second to the third) then the Fortran program should do the same.\n\n But without knowing the intended chain, it's difficult.\n\n However, note the example chain: \n   Input to the first program: an integer N.\n   Output of first program: a long integer.\n\n   Then the second program is run with the string representation of that long integer? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. \n\n This does not work.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the three programs are meant to be run on different inputs? But the problem says the same input.\n\n Alternatively, the entire Fortran program should read all the inputs at once? But the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input\".\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the chain is:\n\n   The first program runs on the first part of the input (an integer) and produces an integer output.\n\n   Then the second program runs on the next part of the input (a string) and produces a string output.\n\n   Then the third program runs on the next part of the input (a line) and produces the final output.\n\n But that is not what the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we have to simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Read the entire input? But the first program only reads an integer.\n\n   Step 2: Run the first program and get an integer.\n\n   Step 3: Use that integer as the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-', not an integer.\n\n   Step 4: Then the third program uses the output string of the second.\n\n This is not possible without knowing the intended data flow.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem, it says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning that the entire chain of the three programs on their respective inputs (with the output of the first becoming the input of the second, and the second to the third) should be reproduced.\n\n But the initial input to the chain is only the input to the first program? Then the second program must take the output of the first as its input. \n\n How can we reconcile the types?\n\n   First program output: a string representation of a long integer (without any extra characters).\n\n   But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. This will cause the second program to output something that is not meaningful for the third.\n\n Therefore, I conclude that the provided set of three programs are not designed to be chained. \n\n But the problem states that they are. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and we are to run them sequentially on the same initial input (which is provided only once)? \n\n   The first program: reads an integer -> input must be an integer.\n   The second program: reads a string -> input must be a string of '.' and '-'.\n   The third program: reads a line -> input must be a line of text.\n\n So the entire Fortran program must read:\n\n   First: an integer (for program 1)\n   Then: a string (for program 2) \n   Then: a line (for program 3)\n\n But that is three separate inputs.\n\n And then the output of the entire Fortran program is the output of the third program? \n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". This implies that the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n So if we read three separate inputs, then there is no chaining.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will follow the specification:\n\n   Only the first block should handle reading input -> so we read all the necessary input at the beginning.\n\n   We read:\n        an integer (for the first program)\n        a string (for the second program)   [but note: the first program's output is supposed to be the second program's input, so we don't read a string for the second?]\n        a line (for the third program)       [but similarly, the second's output should be the third's input]\n\n So we are not to read extra inputs in the middle. We only read once at the beginning.\n\n Therefore, the only input we read is the integer for the first program. Then:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program on that integer, get an integer result (call it res1).\n   Step 2: Convert res1 to a string (call it s1) and use s1 as the input to the second program.\n   Step 3: Run the second program on the string s1, get a string output (call it s2).\n   Step 4: Use s2 as the input to the third program.\n   Step 5: Run the third program on the string s2, get a string output (call it s3).\n   Step 6: Print s3.\n\n But this will not work for the second program because it expects '.' and '-' and we are giving it a string of digits.\n\n This suggests that the example provided might be for three independent problems and not a chain.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the problem is to combine the three programs independently, but with the chaining of data as described. However, the second and third programs are not designed to process the output of the previous one.\n\n Therefore, I will break down the requirements as:\n\n   We are given three separate programs. We must combine them in sequence.\n\n   The input to the entire Fortran program is the same as the input to the first program (an integer).\n\n   Then the output of the first program (an integer) is converted to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines) and that string becomes the input to the second program.\n\n   The second program, which originally decodes a string of '.' and '-' into digits, will now be given a string of digits and possibly a minus sign. How will it behave?\n\n      The second program's logic:\n\n          s = false\n          for each char c in the string:\n            if c == '.':\n                if s: print '1'; s=false\n                else: print '0'\n            else:   // here the else branch is for '-'? but in the original code the other character is '-' (represented by a dash)\n                if s: print '2'; s=false\n                else: s=true\n\n      But our string is composed of digits and possibly '-'. \n\n      For example, if the first program outputs 12, then the string is \"12\".\n\n      Processing:\n          first char: '1' -> not '.' -> else branch: \n                s is initially false -> set s to true -> output nothing.\n          second char: '2' -> not '.' -> else branch: \n                s is true -> then print '2' and set s to false.\n\n      So the output of the second program would be \"2\".\n\n      Then the third program gets the string \"2\". It looks for the last non-space, non-question-mark character: which is '2'. Then it checks if that character is a vowel? It is not. So it outputs \"NO\".\n\n   So the chain is defined, even if it doesn't make sense in the problem domain.\n\n   We will implement the chain as described.\n\n Steps:\n\n   1. Read the integer N (for the first program).\n\n   2. Implement the first program's logic (dynamic programming for DNA sequences) to compute an integer modulo 1000000007.\n\n   3. Convert the integer to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits; note: the result is nonnegative).\n\n   4. Run the second program's logic on this string. The second program's logic:\n\n        s = .false.\n        output_string = ''   (we will build a string for the output of the second program)\n\n        For each character in the string from step 3:\n\n          if the character is '.' then:\n             if s is true then\n                 append '1'\n                 set s = .false.\n             else\n                 append '0'\n          else (meaning it's not '.', so we treat it as the dash? but we have digits and possibly minus) \n             if s is true then\n                 append '2'\n                 set s = .false.\n             else\n                 set s = .true.\n\n        Note: after the loop, if s is still true, then the original second program would not output anything? But the example input in the second program is a complete string of '.' and '-'. In our case, we might leave a trailing s=true. However, the original second program does not have a flush at the end for a pending s. In the original, if the last character is '-' and s becomes true, there is no more character to output? \n\n        But the original second program does not output anything after the loop. So we ignore any trailing state.\n\n        However, the problem states: the second program's output is the string of 0,1,2 that it prints during the loop.\n\n        We will build a string for the output of the second program.\n\n   5. Take the string from step 4 and feed it as the input to the third program.\n\n   6. The third program's logic:\n\n        Find the last non-space, non-question-mark character in the string.\n\n        Convert that character to lowercase.\n\n        Check if it is one of 'a','e','i','o','u','y'. If yes, then the output is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n   7. Print the output (\"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We must be cautious because Fortran has fixed-size strings. We will assume maximum lengths for the intermediate strings.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read N (an integer)\n\n     2. Compute the DP for the DNA problem (first program) -> we'll use iterative DP (since recursion in Fortran might be inefficient and stack overflow) and we note that N can be up to 100? (the original problem constraints for ABC122_D: N up to 100)\n\n        The first program uses memoization with a state of the last 3 characters. The state is a string of 3 characters from {'A','C','G','T'}.\n\n        We can use a 4D DP array: dp(len, a, b, c) for the last three characters? But note: the state is a string of 3. We can map:\n\n            state: three characters -> we can index by numbers: 0=A,1=C,2=G,3=T.\n\n        Dimensions: \n            len: from 0 to N (so 101 states)\n            a, b, c: from 0 to 3 -> 4*4*4 = 64 states per len.\n\n        Total: 101 * 64 = 6464 states.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          dp(0, 3, 3, 3) = 1   (the initial state is \"TTT\", which we represent by 3,3,3? note: T is 3)\n\n          Then for each length from 0 to N-1, and for each state (a,b,c) we try adding a new character d (0 to 3).\n\n          Then the new state becomes (b, c, d). And we check if the last four characters (a,b,c,d) form a forbidden pattern? But note: the state only has the last three. How do we get the last four? We have a, b, c (which are the last three of the current state) and then d.\n\n          We form the string: \n             char0 = character for a, char1 for b, char2 for c, char3 for d.\n\n          Then check if this string contains \"AGC\", and also check the three swaps:\n\n            swap(0,1): (b, a, c, d) -> then form the string and check for \"AGC\"\n            swap(1,2): (a, c, b, d) -> then check?\n            swap(2,3): (a, b, d, c) -> but note: the swap is only for consecutive positions? The problem says: for i=0 to 2, swap i and i+1 and then check if the resulting string has \"AGC\".\n\n          Actually, the original program:\n\n             last4 = last3 + c (so the current state is last3 = [x, y, z], then new last4 = [x, y, z, c]\n\n             Then it checks:\n                 if last4 contains \"AGC\" -> skip.\n                 Then for i in 0 to 2:\n                    swap the i-th and (i+1)-th character to form a new string s, and check if s contains \"AGC\".\n\n          We can do the same.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Initialize:\n             dp(0,3,3,3) = 1\n\n          For length = 0 to N-1:\n             for a = 0 to 3\n             for b = 0 to 3\n             for c = 0 to 3\n                 if dp(length, a, b, c) > 0 then\n                    for d = 0 to 3:\n                         form the string last4 = [a, b, c, d] -> but we have the four numbers.\n\n                         We can form the string? or we can check without forming the string:\n\n                         Check if the substring \"AGC\" appears in the sequence (a,b,c,d) at any consecutive positions? and also in the swapped versions.\n\n                         Specifically:\n\n                            Check1: (a,b,c,d) -> check if (b,c,d) is not needed? we are checking the entire four for the substring \"AGC\". So we check: \n                                if (b==0 and c==2 and d==1) -> because A=0, G=2, C=1 -> then \"AGC\" is 0,2,1? \n                                But wait: \"AGC\" is A->0, G->2, C->1 -> so the consecutive triple starting at position1: (b,c,d) = (0,2,1) is \"AGC\"? \n                                Actually, the last4 is (a,b,c,d). We need to check if any consecutive three equals (0,2,1) -> which is \"AGC\".\n\n                            However, the original checks for the entire string containing \"AGC\", which can appear starting at index0 or index1.\n\n                            So we check:\n                                (a,b,c) -> if (a,b,c) is (0,2,1) -> then we have \"AGC\" at the beginning? but wait, the last4 is (a,b,c,d). We need to check:\n                                   positions0-2: a,b,c -> if a==0, b==2, c==1 -> then it contains \"AGC\"?\n                                   positions1-3: b,c,d -> if b==0, c==2, d==1 -> then it contains \"AGC\".\n\n                            So two possibilities.\n\n                            Then the swaps:\n\n                                Swap0: swap a and b -> new string: (b,a,c,d). Then check for \"AGC\" in the entire string? similarly:\n\n                                   positions0-2: b,a,c -> if b==0, a==2, c==1 -> then \"AGC\"?\n                                   positions1-3: a,c,d -> if a==0, c==2, d==1 -> then \"AGC\"?\n\n                                Swap1: swap b and c -> new string: (a,c,b,d)\n                                   positions0-2: a,c,b -> if a==0, c==2, b==1 -> then \"AGC\"?\n                                   positions1-3: c,b,d -> if c==0, b==2, d==1 -> then \"AGC\"?\n\n                                Swap2: swap c and d -> new string: (a,b,d,c)\n                                   positions0-2: a,b,d -> \n                                   positions1-3: b,d,c -> \n\n                            This is complex. Alternatively, we can form the four strings and check? Since there are only 4 states per character, we can precompute the forbidden patterns.\n\n          How about we define a function `isValid(a,b,c,d)` that returns true if the state (a,b,c,d) is allowed.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            Condition1: the string (a,b,c,d) does not contain the consecutive triplet (0,2,1) at positions (0,1,2) or (1,2,3).\n\n            Condition2: after swapping the first two (a and b) we do not get (0,2,1) at positions (0,1,2) or (1,2,3) in the new string (b,a,c,d).\n\n            Condition3: after swapping the middle two (b and c) we do not get (0,2,1) at positions (0,1,2) or (1,2,3) in the new string (a,c,b,d).\n\n            Condition4: after swapping the last two (c and d) we do not get (0,2,1) at positions (0,1,2) or (1,2,3) in the new string (a,b,d,c).\n\n          But note: the original program does not form the entire string and then check for \"AGC\", it uses string contains. But we can break it down:\n\n            For the original string (a,b,c,d):\n\n                if (b==0 && c==2 && d==1) -> then the substring at positions1-3 is \"AGC\", so invalid.\n                if (a==0 && b==2 && c==1) -> substring at positions0-2 is \"AGC\", invalid.\n\n            For the swap of a and b: (b,a,c,d)\n\n                if (a==0 && c==2 && d==1) -> substring at positions1-3: a,c,d -> but we have (a at pos1, c at pos2, d at pos3) -> so (a,c,d) = (0,2,1) -> invalid.\n                if (b==0 && a==2 && c==1) -> substring at positions0-2: b,a,c -> (b,a,c) = (0,2,1) -> invalid.\n\n            Similarly for the others.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            if (b==0 and c==2 and d==1) return false\n            if (a==0 and b==2 and c==1) return false\n\n            if (b==0 and a==2 and d==1)   # swap of a and b: then the substring starting at index0: (b,a) and then (a,c) and then (c,d) -> but actually we have to check the entire string? \n            But note: the swap only affects positions0 and 1. So the substring starting at index0: (b,a) and then (a,c) -> we are not checking the entire triplet? \n\n          Let me reexamine the original program: it forms a new string by swapping at index i and i+1, and then checks if the new string contains \"AGC\". \n\n          For the swap at index0 and 1: the new string is: [b, a, c, d]. Then we check if this string contains \"AGC\". This means:\n\n             positions0-2: [b,a,c] -> if b==0, a==2, c==1 -> then \"AGC\" (because 0='A', 2='G', 1='C')\n             positions1-3: [a,c,d] -> if a==0, c==2, d==1 -> then \"AGC\"\n\n          Similarly, for swap at index1 and 2: the new string is [a, c, b, d]. Then check:\n\n             positions0-2: [a,c,b] -> if a==0, c==2, b==1 -> then \"AGC\"\n             positions1-3: [c,b,d] -> if c==0, b==2, d==1 -> then \"AGC\"\n\n          For swap at index2 and 3: the new string is [a, b, d, c]. Then check:\n\n             positions0-2: [a,b,d] -> \n             positions1-3: [b,d,c] \n\n          So we need to check 8 possibilities? Actually, for each swap we check two possible triplets.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the only forbidden pattern is the triplet (0,2,1) in consecutive positions? and we have to check in the original and the three swapped strings.\n\n          We can write a helper function:\n\n            function isForbidden(a,b,c,d) \n              ! Check the original\n              if (b==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) return .true.\n              if (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. c==1) return .true.\n\n              ! Check swap0: (b,a,c,d)\n              if (b==0 .and. a==2 .and. c==1) return .true.   ! positions0-2: b,a,c -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C? but wait: 0=A, 2=G, 1=C -> so 0,2,1 is A,G,C -> which is \"AGC\"\n              if (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) return .true.   ! positions1-3: a,c,d -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C\n\n              ! Check swap1: (a,c,b,d)\n              if (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. b==1) return .true.   ! positions0-2: a,c,b -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C\n              if (c==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) return .true.   ! positions1-3: c,b,d -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C\n\n              ! Check swap2: (a,b,d,c)\n              if (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) return .true.   ! positions0-2: a,b,d -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C\n              if (b==0 .and. d==2 .and. c==1) return .true.   ! positions1-3: b,d,c -> 0,2,1 -> A,G,C\n\n              return .false.\n\n          But wait: the triplet (0,2,1) is \"AGC\", and that is the only forbidden pattern? \n\n          So we return true (forbidden) if any of the above 8 triplets occur? Actually, we have 8 conditions.\n\n          However, note that the original program also checks the original string for \"AGC\", which we already did (the first two conditions). And then the swaps: each swap produces a string that we check for \"AGC\", which we did by the next 6 conditions.\n\n          So total 8 conditions.\n\n          But note: the swap2 condition: \n             positions0-2: a,b,d -> if (a,b,d) = (0,2,1) -> then we have \"AGC\"\n             positions1-3: b,d,c -> if (b,d,c) = (0,2,1) -> then we have \"AGC\"\n\n          So the conditions are:\n\n            Condition1: (a,b,c) = (0,2,1)   -> original string positions0-2\n            Condition2: (b,c,d) = (0,2,1)   -> original string positions1-3\n            Condition3: (b,a,c) = (0,2,1)   -> swap0: positions0-2\n            Condition4: (a,c,d) = (0,2,1)   -> swap0: positions1-3\n            Condition5: (a,c,b) = (0,2,1)   -> swap1: positions0-2\n            Condition6: (c,b,d) = (0,2,1)   -> swap1: positions1-3\n            Condition7: (a,b,d) = (0,2,1)   -> swap2: positions0-2\n            Condition8: (b,d,c) = (0,2,1)   -> swap2: positions1-3\n\n          But note: condition3: (b,a,c) = (0,2,1) -> that is (b=0, a=2, c=1). Similarly, condition4: (a,c,d) = (0,2,1) -> a=0, c=2, d=1.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if ( (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. c==1) .or. (b==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) .or. &\n                 (b==0 .and. a==2 .and. c==1) .or. (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) .or. &\n                 (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. b==1) .or. (c==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) .or. &\n                 (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) .or. (b==0 .and. d==2 .and. c==1) ) then\n                isValid = .false.\n            else\n                isValid = .true.\n\n          However, note that condition5: (a,c,b) = (0,2,1) -> a=0, c=2, b=1 -> but condition5 is written as (a,c,b) = (0,2,1) -> that is condition5: a=0, c=2, b=1.\n\n          Condition6: (c,b,d) = (0,2,1) -> c=0, b=2, d=1.\n\n          Condition7: (a,b,d) = (0,2,1) -> a=0, b=2, d=1.\n\n          Condition8: (b,d,c) = (0,2,1) -> b=0, d=2, c=1.\n\n          We'll code accordingly.\n\n        Then:\n\n          if isValid(a,b,c,d) then\n             new_state = (b, c, d)   -> so we update dp(length+1, b, c, d) += dp(length, a, b, c)\n\n        We iterate.\n\n        Finally, the result is the sum of dp(N, a, b, c) for all a,b,c.\n\n     3. Convert the result to a string. We'll use internal write.\n\n     4. Then run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n        We traverse the string from step3 (which is the string representation of the integer) and build a new string (output2) as described.\n\n        We use a logical variable `s` (initialized to .false.) and then for each character in the string:\n\n          if the character is '.' then:\n             if s then\n                 append '1'\n                 s = .false.\n             else\n                 append '0'\n          else\n             if s then\n                 append '2'\n                 s = .false.\n             else\n                 s = .true.\n\n        Note: we don't do anything if s remains true at the end? just as the original.\n\n     5. Then we take the string output2 and run the third program:\n\n        We remove trailing spaces and '?'? Actually, we are to find the last non-space, non-question-mark character.\n\n        We traverse the string from the end to the beginning until we find a character that is not space and not '?'. \n\n        Then convert that character to lowercase (if it is uppercase).\n\n        Then check if that character is one of the vowels: 'a','e','i','o','u','y'.\n\n        Then set the final output string to \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n     6. Print the final output.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n    - We assume the integer result from the first program is nonnegative and has at most 10 digits (because MOD is 10^9+7, so maximum 10 digits).\n\n    - For the second program, the input string (the integer string) might be up to 10 characters. The output string of the second program: each '.' in the input becomes one character, and each non-'.' (which are digits and possibly minus) becomes either nothing (if setting s to true) or one character (if s was true then output '2'). \n\n          Example: \n            input: \"12\" -> \n                first char '1' -> non-'.' -> s was false -> set s to true -> output nothing.\n                second char '2' -> non-'.' -> s is true -> output '2' and set s to false.\n\n            So output2 = \"2\"\n\n          But if the input is \"1.2\": \n            '1' -> s becomes true -> nothing output.\n            '.' -> then if s is true -> output '1' and set s to false.\n            '2' -> non-'.' -> s is false -> set s to true -> nothing output.\n\n            Then output2 = \"1\"\n\n          And if the input ends with a non-'.' and s is true, we leave it.\n\n        The length of output2 is at most the length of the input string? Actually, each character in the input may produce 0 or 1 character in the output. So maximum length = length(input).\n\n    - The third program: the input string is output2 from the second program. We traverse from the end to find the last non-space, non-question-mark.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n    program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      ! ... (declare variables) ...\n\n      ! Step 1: Read N\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      ! Step 2: Compute the DNA DP\n\n      ! We'll define dp(0:N, 0:3, 0:3, 0:3) as an array of integers (or long integers). But note: MOD=1000000007, so we use modulo arithmetic.\n\n      integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n      integer, parameter :: SZ = 3   ! last three, each from 0 to 3 -> 4 possibilities per character\n      integer :: n, i, a, b, c, d\n      integer(8) :: dp(0:100, 0:3, 0:3, 0:3)   ! we assume n<=100, and we use 0-indexed for the length dimension from 0 to n\n      integer(8) :: res1, total\n      character(len=10) :: str1   ! to hold the string representation of res1\n      character(len=10) :: str2   ! for the output of the second program, but we build it dynamically? we can use a character array and then concatenate? or we can use a string buffer.\n\n      ! Initialize dp: only state (3,3,3) at length0 has value 1, others 0.\n      dp = 0\n      dp(0, 3, 3, 3) = 1   ! representing the initial state \"TTT\"\n\n      do i = 0, n-1\n        do a = 0, 3\n          do b = 0, 3\n            do c = 0, 3\n              if (dp(i, a, b, c) == 0) cycle\n              do d = 0, 3\n                ! Check if the new state (a,b,c,d) is allowed\n                if (isForbidden(a,b,c,d)) cycle\n\n                ! Then we update: state (b, c, d) at length i+1\n                dp(i+1, b, c, d) = mod(dp(i+1, b, c, d) + dp(i, a, b, c), MOD)\n              end do\n            end do\n          end do\n        end do\n      end do\n\n      !

Convert res1 to string\n      write(str1, '(I0)') res1   ! I0 writes the integer without extra spaces\n\n      ! Step 4: Run the second program on str1\n      ! We'll build the output string for the second program in a variable called str2, but we don't know the length in advance? We can count the output length.\n\n      ! First, traverse the string and determine the length of the output string.\n      ! But we can build a string of the same length as str1? worst case, the output string is the same length as the input.\n\n      character(len=10) :: temp_str2\n      integer :: str1_len, idx, out_len\n      logical :: s_flag\n\n      str1_len = len_trim(str1)   ! we get the length without trailing spaces? but str1 is written without spaces, so we can use the whole string?\n      ! However, the string might have leading spaces? no, because we used I0. But Fortran's write to a string of length 10: if the number has less than 10 digits, the rest are spaces? so we must trim.\n\n      ! Actually, we should use the trimmed length.\n\n      out_len = 0\n      s_flag = .false.\n\n      do i = 1, str1_len   ! traverse each character in str1\n        if (str1(i:i) == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                out_len = out_len + 1\n                temp_str2(out_len:out_len) = '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, we have the output string in temp_str2(1:out_len). But note: if s_flag remains true, we leave it (no output).\n\n      ! Step 5: Run the third program on the string temp_str2(1:out_len)\n\n      character(len=out_len) :: str3   ! the input for the third program is the string we just built, of length out_len\n      character :: last_char, ch\n      integer :: j\n      logical :: found\n\n      str3 = temp_str2(1:out_len)\n\n      found = .false.\n      last_char = ' '\n      !

If no non-space and non-question-mark found? then we use what? the problem doesn't specify, but the original program breaks the loop when it finds one.\n        ! In the original, if there is none, then ch would be 0? and then we check if it is a vowel? it is not -> so output \"NO\".\n        last_char = ' '\n      end if\n\n      ! Convert last_char to lowercase: if it is uppercase, convert to lowercase. But the string we have in str3 is from the second program, which outputs digits. So it's in the set {'0','1','2'}? \n      ! But the original third program expects a letter? \n\n      ! However, in our chain, the last_char might be a digit. We have to check: is it a vowel? The vowels are letters: 'a','e','i','o','u','y'. \n\n      ! So if last_char is a digit, it won't be a vowel.\n\n      ! We don't need to convert to lowercase if it's not a letter? \n\n      ! But to be safe, we can check if it is a letter and then convert.\n\n      ! Since we know it's a digit, we can skip the conversion? \n\n      ! However, the problem says: convert to lowercase. But if it's not a letter, then tolowercase might not change it.\n\n      ! We can do:\n\n        if (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n            ch = char(ichar(last_char) - ichar('A') + ichar('a')\n        else\n            ch = last_char\n        end if\n\n      ! Then check:\n\n        if (ch=='a' .or. ch=='e' .or. ch=='i' .or. ch=='o' .or. ch=='u' .or. ch=='y') then\n            print *, 'YES'\n        else\n            print *, 'NO'\n        end if\n\n    end program\n\n    We must define the function isForbidden:\n\n      logical function isForbidden(a,b,c,d)\n        integer, intent(in) :: a,b,c,d\n        isForbidden = .false.\n\n        if ( (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. c==1) .or. (b==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) ) then\n            isForbidden = .true.\n        else if ( (b==0 .and. a==2 .and. c==1) .or. (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. d==1) ) then\n            isForbidden = .true.\n        else if ( (a==0 .and. c==2 .and. b==1) .or. (c==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) ) then\n            isForbidden = .true.\n        else if ( (a==0 .and. b==2 .and. d==1) .or. (b==0 .and. d==2 .and. c==1) ) then\n            isForbidden = .true.\n        end if\n\n      end function\n\n  Note: the mapping of tokens to integers:\n\n    We have: TOKENS = {\"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\"} -> so:\n        A -> 0\n        C -> 1\n        G -> 2\n        T -> 3\n\n  We assume the function isForbidden is in the same module? or we can put it inside the program? \n\n  However, Fortran 95 allows internal functions. We'll put it as an internal function.\n\n  But note: the original program also includes the initial state \"TTT\" (which is 3,3,3). And we start at length0 with state (3,3,3) and then build up.\n\n  We assume the array dp is dimensioned (0:100, 0:3, 0:3, 0:3). We assume n<=100.\n\n  But the problem says: the original program has N (from input) and we assume N>=0 and <=100.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: the dp array is 0-indexed for the length dimension.\n\n  We'll write the entire program.\n\n  Note: The second program's input is the string representation of the integer. This integer is nonnegative (because the DNA count) and has no minus sign.\n\n  Therefore, the second program will never see a minus sign.\n\n  The third program then gets a string of digits (from the second program's output) which is either \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", or possibly longer.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the third program's logic: it looks for the last non-space, non-question-mark. Our string from the second program has no spaces and no '?'. So the last character is the last non-space, non-question-mark.\n\n  So we can simply take the last character? \n\n  But note: the second program's output might be empty? if the input string was empty? but the input string is the representation of an integer, which is at least 1 digit (unless the integer is 0 -> then \"0\").\n\n  So the last character is the last character of the output string of the second program.\n\n  Then we check if that character is a vowel? But the vowels are letters, and our last character is a digit (one of '0','1','2'). \n\n  Therefore, the third program will always output \"NO\", because a digit is not a vowel.\n\n  This is the chain we defined.\n\n  But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n  What is the behavior of the original chain?\n\n    Input: an integer N.\n\n    Step1: Program1 outputs an integer X.\n\n    Step2: Program2 is run with input string = the string representation of X. It outputs a string Y.\n\n    Step3: Program3 is run with input string = Y. It outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n  We are simulating exactly that.\n\n  So we output the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  We note that the third program might not be designed to handle digits, but we are following the specification.\n\n  Let's write the complete Fortran program.\n\n  Note: We must be cautious about the array bounds.\n\n  We assume N is at least 0 and at most 100.\n\n  We'll allocate dp(0:100, 0:3, 0:3, 0:3) -> 101*4*4*4 = 6464 elements, which is acceptable.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      ! ...

But MOD is 1000000007, which fits in a 4-byte integer? but the total might be up to 4^100? which is huge. But we are doing mod at every step? \n\n  Actually, we do mod when updating:\n\n      dp(i+1, b, c, d) = mod(dp(i+1, b, c, d) + dp(i, a, b, c), MOD)\n\n  And then mod the total. But the mod is 10^9+7, so we can use 4-byte integers? \n\n  However, the numbers might be large during the summation. So we use 8-byte integers to be safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use 4-byte integers and mod at every step? but the maximum value in dp(i,...) is at most (number of states) * (previous value) and we are modding at every step? \n\n  We'll use 8-byte integers for dp and total.\n\n  We hope that n<=100, and the state space is 64 per length, so the total operations are 100*64*4 = 25600, which is acceptable.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: The third program writes without quotes. The original Java program writes without quotes? but in Fortran, we write:\n\n        write(*,*) 'YES'\n\n    This will print YES with a leading space? \n\n    We can use:\n\n        write(*,'(A)') 'YES'\n\n    to avoid the leading space.\n\n  We'll do that.\n\n  Final code:"
