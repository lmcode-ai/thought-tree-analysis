The second program will process the string output1 as if it were a string of digits and '?'. But note: the string \"Yes\" contains non-digit characters. The second program expects each character to be either a digit or '?'. The second program will break because when it encounters 'Y' (which is not a digit and not '?') it will try to convert to a digit and get an error? Actually, the second program has two cases: if the character is '?', then it loops over 0-9; otherwise, it uses the digit. But if the character is not '?' and not a digit, then it will use the digit value of a non-digit? That would be incorrect. However, the Java code for the second program does:\n\n          if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... }\n          else {\n             int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';   // This will give a negative or non-digit value for 'Y' (which is 89 in ASCII, so 'Y'-'0' is 89-48=41) which is not a digit 0-9.\n\n          } So the second program will use 41 as the digit?

But note: the first program in Java outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", but we are suppressing that and passing it to the second program. We are not printing anything until the end. Let me test with a small example:\n\n      Initial input: \n          n=2\n          str=\"aa\"\n\n      Then the first program: \n          a = first half: \"a\"\n          then a+a = \"aa\", so equals str -> output \"Yes\"\n\n      Then the second program: \n          string = \"Yes\", length=3.\n          base = 1\n          i=0: c = 's' (last character of \"Yes\") k = 's' - '0' = 115 - 48 = 67\n                for pre=0: \n                    state = (1*67 + 0) mod 13 = 67 mod 13 = 67 - 5*13 = 67-65=2 -> so dp[0,2] += 1 (because i=0 and pre=0 is the base condition: j==0? yes, so add 1)\n                for pre=1 to 12: nothing because base condition only for pre=0. Then base = 1*10 mod 13 = 10\n          i=1: c='e' -> k=101-48=53\n                state = (10*53 + pre) mod 13 -> pre from 0 to 12, and then we look at dp[0,pre] which is 0 for all pre except pre=2 (which is 1). so for pre=2: state = (530+2) mod 13 = 532 mod 13 -> 532 /13 = 40*13=520, 532-520=12 -> state=12. Then we set dp[1,12] = 1.\n          i=2: c='Y' -> k=89-48=41\n                base = 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9 (because 100=7*13+9 -> 100-91=9)\n                state = (9*41 + pre) mod13 -> pre from 0 to 12, we have only pre=12 (from previous) with value 1. state = (369+12) mod13 = 381 mod13: 13*29=377, 381-377=4 -> state=4. so dp[2,4]=1. Then the result is dp[2,5] = 0? we are taking state 5 at the last row -> 0. Then third program: input 0 -> (0/3)*2 =0, and mod(0,3)=0 -> then 0. Output 0. This is not the intended result of the original programs, but we are forced by the chain. Given the constraints, we write the Fortran code as described. We must note: the second program does not check for non-digit and non-'?' characters. It treats them as digits by converting to an integer (the ASCII difference). This is what the Java code would do. Therefore, the Fortran code is implemented accordingly. However, the dp array in the second program might be large?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC145_B) reads an integer `n` and a string `str`. It checks if the string is formed by repeating the first half twice. \n    It outputs \"Yes\" if true, \"No\" otherwise.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string and computes a dynamic programming solution for the number of ways to form numbers mod 13 to get 5 mod 13.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer `n` and computes: (n // 3) * 2 + (1 if n mod 3 !=0, else 0).\n\n However, note: the entire sequence must be executed in order, with the output of one becoming the input of the next.\n\n But the first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string. The second program expects a string of digits and '?'. The third expects an integer.\n\n How to chain?\n  The problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n  So:\n    Input to the entire chain: the input for the first program (an integer and a string? Actually, the first program reads an integer and then a string on the next line).\n\n  But note: the second program expects a string (without any integer prefix). The third program expects an integer.\n\n  However, the chain:\n    Program1: Input: first integer n, then a string of length n.\n    Program1: Output: either \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n    Program2: Input: the output of Program1, which is a string of either \"Yes\" or \"No\". But Program2 expects a string of digits and '?'. This does not match.\n\n  Similarly, Program3 expects an integer, but Program2 outputs a number (the dp result) which is a long.\n\n  This indicates that the programs are not designed to be chained arbitrarily. Therefore, we must reconsider the problem.\n\n  The instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  However, the provided programs have different input requirements. Therefore, we must assume that the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program, and then the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and so on.\n\n  But the first program outputs a string, the second expects a string of digits and '?'. How can we use \"Yes\" or \"No\" as the input for the second program? It doesn't make sense.\n\n  Similarly, the third program expects an integer, but the second outputs a long (which we print as an integer).\n\n  This suggests that the chain might be intended to run independently on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  Let me re-read: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n  So the entire chain has one initial input, then:\n\n    Step1: reads the initial input and produces output1.\n    Step2: reads output1 and produces output2.\n    Step3: reads output2 and produces output3.\n\n  But the initial input for the first program is two tokens: an integer and a string. The second program expects a string of digits and '?'. The third expects an integer.\n\n  This chain does not seem compatible.\n\n  However, looking at the actual programs:\n\n    Program1: atcoder_ABC145_B\n        Input: \n            n: integer\n            str: string of length n\n        Output: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n    Program2: atcoder_ABC135_D\n        Input: a string (which is read by `sc.next()` and then converted to char array). This string is expected to contain digits and '?'.\n\n    Program3: codeforces_669_A\n        Input: an integer\n\n  How can we chain? The output of Program1 is a string of either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is 3 or 2 characters. But Program2 expects a string of digits and '?'. This is not compatible.\n\n  This implies that the provided chain might not be designed to work together? Or we are misinterpreting.\n\n  Alternative interpretation: the entire chain uses the same initial input? But the problem says the output of one is the input to the next.\n\n  After re-examining: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n  And \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n  But note: the chain is run on the same initial input? Then how the second program gets the output of the first? The initial input for the chain is the input for the first program.\n\n  The problem does not specify how the outputs and inputs are to be connected if they are incompatible. \n\n  However, after reading the problem again: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n  This implies that the output of the first program (a string) is passed as the input to the second program. The second program then processes that string and produces a number, which is then passed as an integer to the third? But the third program reads an integer from standard input.\n\n  But the second program produces a long and prints it. Then the third program must read that long as an integer? However, the third program reads an integer and then does a calculation.\n\n  But the output of the second program is a single number (mod 1e9+7) and then the third program uses that number as `n`? \n\n  Let's see:\n\n    Program2 output: `System.out.println(dp[dp.length - 1][5]);` -> a single integer (modulo MOD) which is the count mod 1e9+7.\n\n    Program3: reads an integer `n` from stdin and then computes: `(n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`.\n\n  So if we chain:\n\n      Input to chain: (for program1) an integer and a string.\n\n      Output1: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n      Then program2 takes \"Yes\" or \"No\" as a string. But program2 expects a string of digits and '?'. This will cause an exception in the original Java when trying to parse a non-digit character.\n\n  Therefore, the chain as given is not compatible.\n\n  This suggests there might be a misunderstanding. Let me check the filenames: they are from different contests (ABC145, ABC135, and codeforces). They are independent.\n\n  But the problem states: \"meant to be executed in sequence\". How can we resolve?\n\n  I think there might be an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is intended to run on the same initial input independently? But that does not use the output of one as the input to the next.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  Without a clear specification, we must design the Fortran program to do:\n\n      Step 1: Read the initial input (which is for the first program: an integer `n` and a string `str` of length `n`).\n      Step 2: Run the first program's logic: check if `str` is equal to `a+a` (where `a` is the first half). This produces a string output1: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n      Step 3: Use output1 as the input to the second program. The second program will process the string output1 as if it were a string of digits and '?'. But note: the string \"Yes\" contains non-digit characters. The second program expects each character to be either a digit or '?'. \n\n          The second program will break because when it encounters 'Y' (which is not a digit and not '?') it will try to convert to a digit and get an error? Actually, the second program has two cases: if the character is '?', then it loops over 0-9; otherwise, it uses the digit. But if the character is not '?' and not a digit, then it will use the digit value of a non-digit? That would be incorrect.\n\n      However, the Java code for the second program does:\n\n          if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... }\n          else {\n             int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';   // This will give a negative or non-digit value for 'Y' (which is 89 in ASCII, so 'Y'-'0' is 89-48=41) which is not a digit 0-9.\n\n          }\n\n      So the second program will use 41 as the digit? That is not intended.\n\n  This is clearly not the intended chain.\n\n  After rethinking: perhaps the chain is not using the same initial input for all? But the problem says \"the same input\" meaning the initial input for the chain.\n\n  Another possibility: the chain is for processing multiple inputs? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the problem intends for the three programs to be run independently on the same initial input? But that contradicts \"in sequence\".\n\n  Alternatively, maybe the output of the first program is not the string \"Yes\" or \"No\", but something else? The first program writes to stdout, and we capture that as a string for the next.\n\n  But the second program expects a string that is a sequence of digits and '?'. The first program produces either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters). \n\n  How can we make it work? Only if the initial input string for the first program is such that the output of the first program is a string of digits and '?'. But that is not the case in general.\n\n  Therefore, I suspect that the provided set of programs are not meant to be chained in this manner. \n\n  However, the problem requires us to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior when run on the same input.\n\n  What does \"same behavior\" mean? It must be that the Fortran program, when given the initial input (an integer and a string) does:\n\n      Step 1: Check if the string is formed by repeating the first half. Output to memory (not to screen) the string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n      Step 2: Take that string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and run the second program's logic on it. But the second program is designed for strings of digits and '?'. This will yield 0 for non-digit strings? Or perhaps we should skip the second program? \n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  Another interpretation: the entire sequence is run on the same initial input, meaning the same integer and string, and then the third program also uses the same initial integer? But then why chain?\n\n  After reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must pass the output as the input.\n\n  Given the incompatibility, I think there might be a mistake in the problem. But since we must produce a Fortran program, we will do:\n\n      The initial input: we read an integer `n` and a string `str` of length `n` (as in the first program).\n\n      Then we run the first program's logic and store the result (either the string \"Yes\" or \"No\") in a variable.\n\n      Then we run the second program, but the second program's input should be the string from the initial input? Or the output of the first? \n\n  The problem says: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n  So we must use the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" as the input to the second program.\n\n  Then the second program will process that string and compute a number mod 13. Then we pass that number as an integer to the third program.\n\n  The third program will then compute: (number/3)*2 + (if number mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0).\n\n  And then the entire Fortran program outputs the result of the third program.\n\n  But note: the original programs output at every step. The problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n  So we suppress the intermediate outputs and only the final output (of the third program) is printed.\n\n  Therefore, we design:\n\n      Step 1: Read `n` and `str` (the initial input).\n      Step 2: Run first program's logic to determine if `str` is a repetition of its first half. This produces a string `res1` which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n      Step 3: Use `res1` as the input string for the second program.\n      Step 4: Run the second program's logic on the string `res1`. This produces a long `res2` (mod 1e9+7) which is the count of numbers mod 13 that equal 5, under the given pattern. But note: the string `res1` does not contain digits or '?' so we will get:\n          For each character in `res1` (which is either 'Y','e','s','N','o'):\n            If the character is not '?' (which it isn't), then we take the digit = character - '0'. This will give an integer for the digit, but the character is a letter so we get an integer that is not between 0 and 9.\n\n          The second program does not check for invalid digits. It will proceed with any integer. So we will get a result, but it is not meaningful.\n\n      Step 5: Take the number `res2` and use it as the input integer for the third program.\n      Step 6: The third program computes: `result = (res2 / 3) * 2`\n               then if (mod(res2,3) /= 0) then add 1.\n\n      Step 7: Print `result`.\n\n  This is the only way to chain as described.\n\n  However, note that the second program uses the string in reverse order? It processes from the last character to the first. And the modulus base is increasing.\n\n  But we are feeding it \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are not numerical. The results will be arbitrary.\n\n  Given the problem, we must implement the chain as described.\n\n  Implementation in Fortran:\n\n    We'll have:\n        program main\n        implicit none\n\n        ! Step 1: Read the initial input\n        integer :: n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: str   ! we will read a string of length n\n\n        ! Step 2: First program logic\n        character(len=3) :: res1  ! \"Yes\" has 3, \"No\" has 2, but we'll use 3 and then trim? Actually, we need the whole string including the length.\n        ! But note: the second program uses the entire string. So we must store the entire output string of the first program.\n\n        ! How we read: first integer n, then a string of length n.\n\n        read(*,*) n\n        ! We need to read the next line as a string of exactly n characters? \n        ! The Java program uses `cin.nextLine()` after `cin.nextInt()` to clear the newline and then reads the string.\n\n        ! We'll read the next line and then take the first n characters? Or the entire line? The problem says the string is of length n.\n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: str)\n        read(*,'(A)') str   ! read a line and take the first n characters? But if the line has more than n, we take first n? Or exactly n?\n        ! The Java program: `str = cin.nextLine();` and then it uses the entire line? But the problem says the string is of length n.\n\n        ! We'll assume the next line has at least n characters. We take the first n.\n\n        ! Now, run the first program:\n        if (is_repeated(str, n)) then\n            res1 = \"Yes\"\n        else\n            res1 = \"No\"\n        end if\n\n        ! Now, Step 3: use res1 as the input string for the second program.\n        ! The second program expects a string of digits and '?' but we are giving it res1.\n\n        !

We are using integer(kind=8) for `dp` and `res2`.\n\n  Also, note: the modulus operation in the second program for the state: `(base * next + pre) % 13` is mod 13.\n\n  But the base might be negative? We use mod(base,13) but base is always positive in our computation.\n\n  But note: in the second program, the state index is computed as `(base * next + pre) % 13`. We can use the Fortran `mod` function, which returns a nonnegative result if the arguments are nonnegative.\n\n  However, `base * next + pre` might be negative? In our case, base, next, pre are nonnegative.\n\n  Also, the Java program does:\n        base = base * 10 % 13;\n    We do: base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n  This should be safe.\n\n  But note: the second program in Java initializes the dp array for i==0 conditionally. We do the same.\n\n  However, there is a bug in the Fortran code for the second program: in the non-'?' branch, we have a loop over j (pre) and we update dp(i, ...). But we are not using k as the digit? Actually, we computed k from the character. But we use that k for all j.\n\n  Also, note: the indices for dp: we are using 0-indexed in the state dimension, which is 0..12. That's correct.\n\n  But the dp array is defined as:\n        dp(0:len_s-1, 0:12)\n\n  And we iterate i from 0 to len_s-1.\n\n  Also, the state index: `mod(base * k + j, 13)` -> but note: base, k, j are integers. The modulus 13 is positive. We use `mod(base*k+j, 13)`. However, the modulus function in Fortran for integers is `mod(a,13)` which returns a nonnegative remainder.\n\n  But note: the modulus operation in Java is also nonnegative for nonnegative numbers? Actually, in Java the modulus can be negative? Let me check: \n      In Java, the modulus operation for nonnegative numbers is nonnegative.\n\n  We are using nonnegative numbers.\n\n  However, there is a problem: the digit `k` in the non-'?' branch might be negative? For example, if the character is 'Y' (ASCII 89) then k = 89 - 48 = 41, which is positive. But if the character is something with ASCII less than '0', then negative. But our string is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so all characters are letters -> they are above '0'? Actually, '0' is 48, 'A' is 65, so all uppercase letters are positive when subtracted by '0'. But they are not digits.\n\n  We'll proceed anyway.\n\n  Finally, the third program: we are passing a potentially large number (mod 1e9+7, so between 0 and 10^9+6) and then we do integer division by 3. We use integer(kind=8) for x and then convert the result to an integer (default kind) for the output? But the third program in Java uses `int n` and then does integer arithmetic. The number is at most 10^9+6, so when we do (n/3)*2 we get about 666e6, which fits in a 32-bit integer? But Fortran integer might be 32-bit. To be safe, we do:\n\n        temp = x / 3   ! integer division, truncates towards zero? \n        then temp * 2 -> integer\n\n  But note: in Java, integer division truncates towards zero. In Fortran, for positive numbers it's the same.\n\n  Also, the condition: if mod(x,3) /= 0 then add 1.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we are reading only at the beginning and writing only at the end.\n\n  But note: the first program in Java outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", but we are suppressing that and passing it to the second program.\n\n  We are not printing anything until the end.\n\n  Let me test with a small example:\n\n      Initial input: \n          n=2\n          str=\"aa\"\n\n      Then the first program: \n          a = first half: \"a\"\n          then a+a = \"aa\", so equals str -> output \"Yes\"\n\n      Then the second program: \n          string = \"Yes\", length=3.\n          base = 1\n          i=0: c = 's' (last character of \"Yes\")\n                k = 's' - '0' = 115 - 48 = 67\n                for pre=0: \n                    state = (1*67 + 0) mod 13 = 67 mod 13 = 67 - 5*13 = 67-65=2 -> so dp[0,2] += 1 (because i=0 and pre=0 is the base condition: j==0? yes, so add 1)\n                for pre=1 to 12: nothing because base condition only for pre=0.\n          Then base = 1*10 mod 13 = 10\n          i=1: c='e' -> k=101-48=53\n                state = (10*53 + pre) mod 13 -> pre from 0 to 12, and then we look at dp[0,pre] which is 0 for all pre except pre=2 (which is 1).\n                so for pre=2: state = (530+2) mod 13 = 532 mod 13 -> 532 /13 = 40*13=520, 532-520=12 -> state=12. Then we set dp[1,12] = 1.\n          i=2: c='Y' -> k=89-48=41\n                base = 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9 (because 100=7*13+9 -> 100-91=9)\n                state = (9*41 + pre) mod13 -> pre from 0 to 12, we have only pre=12 (from previous) with value 1.\n                state = (369+12) mod13 = 381 mod13: 13*29=377, 381-377=4 -> state=4.\n                so dp[2,4]=1.\n\n          Then the result is dp[2,5] = 0? we are taking state 5 at the last row -> 0.\n\n      Then third program: input 0 -> (0/3)*2 =0, and mod(0,3)=0 -> then 0. Output 0.\n\n  This is not the intended result of the original programs, but we are forced by the chain.\n\n  Given the constraints, we write the Fortran code as described.\n\n  We must note: the second program does not check for non-digit and non-'?' characters. It treats them as digits by converting to an integer (the ASCII difference). This is what the Java code would do.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran code is implemented accordingly.\n\n  However, the dp array in the second program might be large? The string \"Yes\" has length 3, so the dp array is 3x13, which is small.\n\n  But what if the first program outputs \"No\", which is length 2? Then the dp array is 2x13.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  One more issue: the modulus operation for the state might be expensive? But the numbers are small.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  Note: Fortran does not have built-in modulo for negative numbers that returns nonnegative? But our numbers are nonnegative.\n\n  We use `mod(a,13)`.\n\n  Also, the base might become negative? We do base = mod(base*10, 13) and base is initially 1, then 10, then 9, then 12, etc. Always nonnegative.\n\n  We'll now write the Fortran code.\n\n  Important: We must use integer(kind=8) for the dp array to avoid overflow? The MOD is 1e9+7, so the numbers can be up to 1e9+6. We are doing modulo 13 arithmetic so the state dimension is 13, but the number of ways can be large. We use 64-bit integers.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:len_s-1, 0:12)\n\n  But note: the string length for the second program is either 2 or 3. So we can also use a small array.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n        len_s = len(s)\n        allocate(dp(0:len_s-1, 0:12))   ! if we want to allocate dynamically, but len_s is small.\n\n  But in the function, we can use automatic arrays:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:len_s-1, 0:12)\n\n  This is allowed if len_s is not too big, and it is small (2 or 3).\n\n  Code:"
