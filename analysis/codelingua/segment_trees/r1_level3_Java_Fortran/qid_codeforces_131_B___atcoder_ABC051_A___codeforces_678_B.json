But note: the program accumulates the days from y+1 to i? and then checks if mod7 is 0. Then it also checks the leap status of the candidate year i must be the same as the leap status of y. However, note: the program does:\n\n              int sum = 0;\n              for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                  if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                  else sum += 365; if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                      if (check_leap(i) == leap) then output i and break. So the condition is: the total days from y+1 to i (inclusive) mod7 is 0 and the leap status of i is the same as that of y. We must do the same. Steps:\n\n          Read n\n          Read n integers (each in the range -10 to 10) Compute:\n             cnt(0:20) = 0\n             For each number a, do: index = a+10 -> cnt(index)++\n\n          res = 0\n          do i = 0,9\n             res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20-i)\n          end do\n          res = res + (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2   [because pairs of zeros]\n\n          Then set: y = res\n\n          Now, for the third program:\n\n          Define a function to check leap: \n             logical function is_leap(yr)\n                 is_leap = (mod(yr,400)==0) .or. (mod(yr,4)==0 .and. mod(yr,100)/=0) Then:\n             leap0 = is_leap(y)   ! leap status of the input year y Then we start from i = y+1 and accumulate days (mod7? but we don't need the exact sum, we need mod7). Actually, we can do mod7 at each step. Let current = 0   ! mod7\n          i = y+1\n          do \n             if (is_leap(i)) then\n                 current = mod(current + 366, 7)\n             else\n                 current = mod(current + 365, 7)\n             end if\n\n             if (current == 0) then\n                 if (is_leap(i) .eqv. leap0) then\n                     print *, i\n                     exit\n                 end if\n             end if\n             i = i+1\n          end do\n\n        But note: the original third program does not use mod7 until the condition? but we can do mod7 at each step to avoid big numbers. However, 366 mod7 = 2, 365 mod7 = 1. So we can do:\n\n          current = mod(current + (if leap then 2 else 1), 7) But note: the original program does:\n\n          sum % 7 == 0\n\n          So we can simulate with mod7. Also, the leap status of the current year i is used only in the condition. Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n          We read the integers for the first program. We compute the result (res) as described. Then we set y = res. Then we do the loop for the third program. But note: the second program is effectively a no-op? so we skip it.

But note: we are doing mod7, so we don't need the exact total days? we only care mod7. Actually, we can compute:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + (366 mod7), 7)   -> which is 366 mod7 = 2\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + (365 mod7), 7)   -> which is 1\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if (is_leap(j)) then\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n          else\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n          end if\n\n        This avoids large numbers and uses mod7 arithmetic. But note: the modulus operation in Fortran: mod(a,b) returns the remainder in [0, b-1] if a>=0? and if a<0? we are always nonnegative. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7) if (is_leap(j)) total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)   -> because 365 mod7=1, 366 mod7=2 = 1+1. But that's the same. I'll do:\n\n          if (is_leap(j)) then\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n          else\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n          end if\n\n        But then we must ensure that the modulus is nonnegative? mod in Fortran returns nonnegative if the arguments are nonnegative. Therefore, we write:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod, 7)   ! not necessary because we are keeping it mod7? but we do mod at each step. Actually, we are doing mod at each step? so total_days_mod is always in [0,6]. So we can do:\n\n          total_days_mod = 0   ! initially\n\n          do j = y+1, huge(1_8)   ! until we break\n             if (is_leap(j)) then\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n             else\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n             end if\n\n             if (total_days_mod == 0) then\n                 if (is_leap(j) .eqv.",

IMPORTANT: The initial value of cnt must be zero. We did: cnt = 0. We use kind=8 for the large integers. Let me write the code accordingly. We'll use:\n\n          integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18) But for simplicity, we can use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: ...   ! if the compiler supports kind=8.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The plan:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_131_B) reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It counts the frequency of (each number + 10) in an array of 21 elements (index 0 to 20). Then it calculates:\n      res = sum_{i=0}^{9} [ cnt[i] * cnt[20-i] ] + (cnt[10]*(cnt[10]-1))/2\n    and prints `res`.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces every comma with a space. Then it prints the string.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_678_B) reads an integer `y` (a year). It checks if `y` is leap. Then it starts from the next year and counts days (mod 7) until it finds a year that has the same leap status as `y` and the total days mod7 becomes 0. Then it prints that year.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is the input to the second? But wait: the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n\n   Program 1: outputs a single integer (res).\n   Program 2: expects a string (with commas to replace). But the input from program1 is an integer. How does that work?\n\n   Actually, the problem states: the entire sequence. So we must consider the chain:\n\n        Input to the entire sequence: the input for the first program.\n        Then the output of the first program becomes the input for the second program.\n        Then the output of the second program becomes the input for the third program.\n\n   However, the second program expects a string with commas. The first program outputs an integer. This integer is then fed as a string to the second program? For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would read the string \"123\" and replace commas? There are no commas so it becomes \"123\" -> \"123\" and then the third program would read this string? But the third program reads an integer (using nextInt).\n\n   This chain does not look compatible. But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and that we are to translate the entire sequence into one Fortran program.\n\n   How the original chain would run:\n\n        Step 1: Run program1 -> outputs an integer (say X) to stdout.\n        Step 2: Run program2 with input X (as a string). Program2 replaces commas in that string with spaces. Since there are no commas, it outputs the same string (X as a string).\n        Step 3: Run program3 with input X (as a string). The third program uses a Scanner which by nextInt() would read the integer from that string.\n\n   So effectively, the chain:\n\n        Input to the chain: the input for program1 (n and then n integers).\n        Then program1 outputs an integer X.\n        Then program2 takes X as a string and outputs the same string (unchanged).\n        Then program3 takes X as an integer (by reading the integer from the string) and then does its calculation and outputs a year.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n        Input: \n            first integer: n\n            then n integers (each in the range [-10,10] as per the first program)\n\n        Output: the output of the third program (an integer, the next year with the same leap property and same starting day?).\n\n   However, note: the third program does not use the output of the first program as its input? It reads an integer `y` (the year). But in the chain, the input to the third program is the output of the second program which is the same as the output of the first program (an integer). So the third program will use that integer as the year? \n\n   But the first program's output is a count (a nonnegative integer) and the third program expects a year? This does not make sense.\n\n   This indicates that the chain as provided is not intended to be run as:\n\n        program1 < input.txt | program2 | program3\n\n   because the third program expects a year, but the first program outputs a count of pairs.\n\n   Therefore, we must reconsider the problem: it says \"the entire sequence\" and that the output of each is the input to the next. \n\n   But the three programs are independent and not designed to be chained. However, the problem states we are to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically to the original chain.\n\n   The chain is:\n\n        Input: the input for the first program (n and n integers) -> output: a number (X)\n        Then the second program takes X (as a string) and replaces commas -> output: the same string (since no commas) -> so X as a string.\n        Then the third program takes that string and reads an integer from it (which is X) and then uses it as the year.\n\n   So the third program will run with `y = X` (the result from the first program).\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and then n integers).\n        Step 2: Compute the result X as in the first program.\n        Step 3: Use X as the input for the third program (bypassing the second program because the second program doesn't change the string representation of X).\n\n        But note: the second program is effectively a no-op? Because it replaces commas and there are none. So we can skip the string conversion and just pass X as an integer to the third program? However, the chain is defined by the outputs and inputs as strings.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we are not to simulate the I/O in between. We are to combine the three without intermediate I/O.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          - Read the input for the first program.\n          - Compute the result X (as in program1).\n          - Then use X as the year for the third program.\n\n        We skip the second program because it does nothing when the input string has no commas. But note: what if the integer X has commas? For example, in some locales integers are printed with commas? But the Java program prints without commas. So the string representation of X has no commas. Therefore, the second program outputs the same string.\n\n        So we can ignore the second program? But the problem says \"translate the entire sequence\". We must account for every program.\n\n        However, the second program is:\n\n            String a = br.readLine();\n            sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n\n        This replaces every comma in the input string by a space. Since the input string is the output of the first program (which is an integer without commas), the output is the same as the input.\n\n        Therefore, the output of the second program is the same as the input (the integer X as a string). Then the third program reads that string and converts it to an integer (which is X). So we can just use X as the year for the third program.\n\n        But note: the third program expects a year? And X is the result of the first program (which counts pairs of numbers). X might be a very large number? And then the third program uses it as a year? That might be out of range? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must do exactly that.\n\n        So the Fortran program:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and then n integers (from stdin).\n          Step 2: Compute X (as in the first program).\n          Step 3: Use X as the year in the third program? But note: the third program reads an integer and then starts from the next year. However, the first program's output is a nonnegative integer (could be very large?).\n\n        However, the input for the first program: n up to 10^5? and each integer in [-10,10]. Then the maximum value for cnt[i] is 10^5. Then the product cnt[i]*cnt[20-i] is at most 10^10. Then res is the sum of 10 such terms (plus the term for cnt[10]) so at most 10^10? That is 10 billion. Then the third program will start from year = 10 billion + 1 and then iterate until it finds the next year that matches? That would be too slow (because the step might be 100000 years? and we are iterating one year at a time).\n\n        This is a problem? But the original chain would do exactly that? So we have to do the same.\n\n        Therefore, we must simulate the third program with a very large starting year? and iterate until we find the next year that satisfies the condition? which might be 100000 years? That might be acceptable in Fortran? Actually, worst-case the third program might iterate 7 years? because the leap year cycle is 400 years? but note: we are counting mod7 and leap status. Actually, the cycle of the calendar is 400 years? but we are starting at a very large year? and we are only concerned about the next year that matches? Actually, the problem in the third program is:\n\n          It starts at y+1 and then adds the days of each year until the total days mod7 becomes 0 and the leap status is the same.\n\n        How many years will it iterate? The condition on the leap status and mod7 might happen every 6 years? or 11? but worst-case it is at most 6 years? because the mod7 cycle? But note: the leap status breaks the cycle. Actually, the next year with the same leap status and the same day of the week (mod7) might be 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 28 years? but the worst-case cycle is 28 years? because 28 is a multiple of 7 and the leap year pattern repeats every 28 years? Actually, the Gregorian calendar has a 400-year cycle. But the problem does not specify the range of the year? and we are starting at 10^10? so 10 billion? 10^10 mod 400 might be computed? but the iteration is over at most 400 years? because the calendar repeats every 400 years? Actually, the condition:\n\n          total_days mod7 = 0 and same leap status.\n\n        How to compute the next occurrence? We note that the day of the week advances by 1 mod7 in a common year and 2 in a leap year.\n\n        But the third program does a linear search. We must do the same.\n\n        However, note: the third program might run for at most 400 years? because the pattern of leap years repeats every 400 years? and the days mod7 also repeats? Actually, the entire calendar repeats every 400 years? (because 400 years have exactly 146097 days which is divisible by 7). Therefore, the next year that satisfies the condition must be within 400 years? so we can iterate at most 400 years.\n\n        Why? Because the state (leap status of the year and the day of the week of Jan 1) is periodic with period 400. So we can break after at most 400 iterations.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n          Step 2: Compute X (the result of the first program).\n          Step 3: Set `y = X` (the year for the third program) and then compute the leap status of `y`.\n          Step 4: Start from `i = y+1` and iterate until we find a year `i` such that:\n                   (a) The total days from year y+1 to i (inclusive? note: the program counts from y+1 to i) mod7 becomes 0? Actually, the program counts the days from year y+1 to the candidate year? and then mod7. But note: the program accumulates the days from y+1 to i? and then checks if mod7 is 0. Then it also checks the leap status of the candidate year i must be the same as the leap status of y.\n\n          However, note: the program does:\n\n              int sum = 0;\n              for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                  if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                  else sum += 365;\n                  if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                      if (check_leap(i) == leap) then output i and break.\n\n          So the condition is: the total days from y+1 to i (inclusive) mod7 is 0 and the leap status of i is the same as that of y.\n\n        We must do the same.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n\n          Read n integers (each in the range -10 to 10)\n\n          Compute:\n             cnt(0:20) = 0\n             For each number a, do: index = a+10 -> cnt(index)++\n\n          res = 0\n          do i = 0,9\n             res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20-i)\n          end do\n          res = res + (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2   [because pairs of zeros]\n\n          Then set: y = res\n\n          Now, for the third program:\n\n          Define a function to check leap: \n             logical function is_leap(yr)\n                 is_leap = (mod(yr,400)==0) .or. (mod(yr,4)==0 .and. mod(yr,100)/=0)\n\n          Then:\n             leap0 = is_leap(y)   ! leap status of the input year y\n\n          Then we start from i = y+1 and accumulate days (mod7? but we don't need the exact sum, we need mod7). Actually, we can do mod7 at each step.\n\n          Let current = 0   ! mod7\n          i = y+1\n          do \n             if (is_leap(i)) then\n                 current = mod(current + 366, 7)\n             else\n                 current = mod(current + 365, 7)\n             end if\n\n             if (current == 0) then\n                 if (is_leap(i) .eqv. leap0) then\n                     print *, i\n                     exit\n                 end if\n             end if\n             i = i+1\n          end do\n\n        But note: the original third program does not use mod7 until the condition? but we can do mod7 at each step to avoid big numbers.\n\n        However, 366 mod7 = 2, 365 mod7 = 1. So we can do:\n\n          current = mod(current + (if leap then 2 else 1), 7)\n\n        But note: the original program does:\n\n          sum % 7 == 0\n\n          So we can simulate with mod7.\n\n        Also, the leap status of the current year i is used only in the condition.\n\n        Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n          We read the integers for the first program.\n\n          We compute the result (res) as described.\n\n          Then we set y = res.\n\n          Then we do the loop for the third program.\n\n        But note: the second program is effectively a no-op? so we skip it.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are not doing any I/O in the middle.\n\n        But note: the input for the third program is the output of the second program, which is the same as the output of the first program. We are directly using the integer `res` as the input for the third program. So we are simulating the chain without actually converting to string and back? which is acceptable because the second program did nothing.\n\n        Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n          Steps:\n\n            implicit none\n            integer, parameter :: N_max = 100000\n            integer :: n, i, a, idx\n            integer(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20)   ! because the counts might be large (10^5) and product 10^10, so use 64-bit for cnt and res\n            integer(kind=8) :: res\n            integer(kind=8) :: y, j, total_days_mod\n            logical :: leap0, leap_current, is_leap\n\n            ! Read n\n            read(*,*) n\n\n            ! Initialize cnt to 0\n            cnt = 0\n\n            ! Read the n integers\n            do i = 1, n\n                read(*,*) a\n                idx = a + 10\n                if (idx < 0 .or. idx > 20) then\n                    ! According to the first program, a is in [-10,10] so idx in [0,20]. But if not, skip?\n                    ! But the problem says the input is as per the first program.\n                    cycle\n                end if\n                cnt(idx) = cnt(idx) + 1\n            end do\n\n            ! Compute res\n            res = 0\n            do i = 0, 9\n                res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20-i)\n            end do\n            res = res + (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2\n\n            ! Now set y = res (the output of the first program, which becomes the input to the third program)\n            y = res\n\n            ! Now, the third program: we need a function for leap year? or inline.\n            ! Check leap0 (the leap status of y)\n            leap0 = is_leap(y)\n\n            ! Now, we start from j = y+1 and accumulate days mod7 until we get a year j such that:\n            !   (a) the accumulated days mod7 is 0\n            !   (b) is_leap(j) == leap0\n\n            total_days_mod = 0\n            j = y+1\n            do\n                if (is_leap(j)) then\n                    total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 366, 7)\n                else\n                    total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 365, 7)\n                end if\n\n                ! But note: 366 mod7 is 2, 365 mod7 is 1 -> we could have done:\n                !   total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + (1 + merge(1,0,is_leap(j))), 7)\n                ! But we did the above.\n\n                if (total_days_mod == 0) then\n                    if (is_leap(j) .eqv. leap0) then\n                        write(*,*) j\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n                j = j+1\n            end do\n\n          contains\n\n            logical function is_leap(yr)\n                integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: yr\n                if (mod(yr,400_8)==0) then\n                    is_leap = .true.\n                else if (mod(yr,100_8)==0) then\n                    is_leap = .false.\n                else if (mod(yr,4_8)==0) then\n                    is_leap = .true.\n                else\n                    is_leap = .false.\n                end if\n            end function\n\n        However, note: the third program in Java uses integers (32-bit) for the year. But our year `y` is the result from the first program which is a long (64-bit in Java) but in Fortran we are using integer(kind=8) for y and j. But the leap year function must work for large integers? The modulus operations in Fortran for integers of kind=8 are fine.\n\n        But note: the leap year condition: \n            y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0)\n\n        We must be cautious: mod(yr,400_8) uses 400 as an integer of kind=8.\n\n        Also, the iteration: we are iterating from y+1 until we find the next year. The next year might be within 400 years? so we do at most 400 iterations? But note: the starting year might be huge (like 10^10) but the condition repeats every 400 years? so we can compute the next occurrence without iterating 400 times? but the problem says to reproduce the behavior. The original program does a linear iteration. We do the same.\n\n        However, worst-case we might iterate 400 years? which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: what if the starting year is 10^10? then we are iterating 400 years -> 400 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n        One more note: the original third program does:\n\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i)) \n                    sum += 366;\n                else \n                    sum += 365;\n                if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                    if (check_leap(i) == leap) \n                        print and break\n                }\n            }\n\n        We are doing the same with mod7.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Java for negative mod? but our total_days_mod is nonnegative and mod7 gives in [0,6]. So safe.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Important: We must use integer(kind=8) for y and j because y might be up to 10^10 (which is about 10^10, and 10^10 is 10 billion, which fits in 4 bytes? 2^31 is about 2e9, so 10^10 is 10 billion which is 10^10 > 2^31 (2e9) -> so we need 64-bit integers.\n\n        Also, the iteration variable j: we are starting at y+1 which is 10^10+1 and then we do 400 iterations -> so j becomes 10^10+400, which is still within 64-bit integers.\n\n        Therefore, the program:\n\n          We'll use integer(kind=8) for: n? (n is up to 10^5, so 32-bit is enough) but for y and j we use 64-bit.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: n_i8   ? But n is read as integer and then we use it for loops? The problem says n from input, which is up to 10^5 -> fits in 32-bit.\n\n        However, to be consistent, we can use 64-bit for all integers? But it's not necessary. But for simplicity, we can use:\n\n          integer :: n   ! 32-bit for n (max 10^5) and the indices i, idx (which are in [0,20] or n up to 10^5) -> 32-bit is enough.\n\n          But for cnt and res: we need 64-bit because the product of two cnt (each up to 10^5) is 10^10 -> 64-bit.\n\n        So:\n\n          n: integer (32-bit)\n          a, idx: integer (32-bit)\n          cnt: integer(kind=8) (64-bit) array(0:20)\n          res: integer(kind=8)\n          y, j: integer(kind=8)\n          total_days_mod: integer (32-bit) because mod7 -> 0 to 6, but we can use 32-bit.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 64-bit for all? Fortran: if we use integer(kind=8) for all, then it's safe.\n\n        But note: the function is_leap: we are using modulus with 400, 100, 4 -> we use 64-bit integers.\n\n        Let me write the entire program with 64-bit for all integers that might be large? and 32-bit for indices.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n          integer(int64) :: cnt(0:20), res, y, j, total_days_mod   ! but total_days_mod mod7 -> 32-bit is enough, but let's use int64 for consistency? but modulus 7: we can use a 32-bit integer? but to avoid type conversion, we can use int64 for everything.\n\n        However, total_days_mod: we are doing mod7, so it's in [0,6]. We can use 32-bit. But for consistency, we use int64.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          integer :: n, i, a, idx\n          integer(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20) = 0, res, y, j\n          integer :: total_days_mod   ! 32-bit\n\n        But then in:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 366, 7)   -> 366 and 365 are 32-bit? but we are adding to total_days_mod (32-bit) and then mod7. But the maximum value: we are adding 366 at each step, and we do at most 400 steps: 400*366 = 146400 -> which fits in 32-bit.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          integer :: total_days_mod   ! 32-bit\n\n        But note: the original program uses `int` for the sum? which is 32-bit? and 400*366 = 146400 -> fits. So safe.\n\n        However, to avoid any confusion, we can use 64-bit for everything? but it's not necessary.\n\n        I'll use:\n\n          integer :: n, i, a, idx, total_days_mod\n          integer(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20), res, y, j\n\n        Then in the loop:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 366, 7)   -> but 366 is integer? and total_days_mod is integer? so we are using 32-bit for the modulus.\n\n        But note: we are doing mod7, so we don't need the exact total days? we only care mod7.\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + (366 mod7), 7)   -> which is 366 mod7 = 2\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + (365 mod7), 7)   -> which is 1\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if (is_leap(j)) then\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n          else\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n          end if\n\n        This avoids large numbers and uses mod7 arithmetic.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Fortran: mod(a,b) returns the remainder in [0, b-1] if a>=0? and if a<0? we are always nonnegative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n          if (is_leap(j)) total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)   -> because 365 mod7=1, 366 mod7=2 = 1+1.\n\n        But that's the same.\n\n        I'll do:\n\n          if (is_leap(j)) then\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n          else\n              total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n          end if\n\n        But then we must ensure that the modulus is nonnegative? mod in Fortran returns nonnegative if the arguments are nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n          total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod, 7)   ! not necessary because we are keeping it mod7? but we do mod at each step.\n\n        Actually, we are doing mod at each step? so total_days_mod is always in [0,6].\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          total_days_mod = 0   ! initially\n\n          do j = y+1, huge(1_8)   ! until we break\n             if (is_leap(j)) then\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n             else\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n             end if\n\n             if (total_days_mod == 0) then\n                 if (is_leap(j) .eqv. leap0) then\n                     write(*,*) j\n                     exit\n                 end if\n             end if\n          end do\n\n        But note: the original program does not do mod at each step? but it does mod only for the condition? but we are doing mod at each step to keep the number small. This is equivalent because:\n\n          (a + b) mod7 = ( (a mod7) + b ) mod7\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Now, we write the entire program.\n\n        Edge: what if the first program outputs 0? then the third program starts at year 1? and then checks.\n\n        We assume the input for the first program is as described.\n\n        Code:\n\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, a, idx, total_days_mod\n          integer(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20), res, y, j\n          logical :: leap0, leap_j\n\n          !

So it's safe.\n\n        Also, we are using integer(kind=8) for yr.\n\n        Let me test with a small example.\n\n        But the problem says: the entire chain.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        Note: The second program is skipped because it did nothing? but we are effectively passing the integer from the first to the third without I/O. And the second program in the chain would not change the integer. So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n          We write the above.\n\n        One more note: the first program uses an array of 21 elements (0..20). We use 0:20.\n\n        We assume the input n and then n integers.\n\n        We write the entire code.\n\n        IMPORTANT: The initial value of cnt must be zero. We did: cnt = 0.\n\n        We use kind=8 for the large integers.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n\n        But for simplicity, we can use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: ...   ! if the compiler supports kind=8.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: int64\n          but the problem doesn't specify. So we use kind=8.\n\n        Code:\n\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, a, idx, total_days_mod\n          integer(kind=8) :: cnt(0:20), res, y, j\n          logical :: leap0, leap_j\n\n          ! Initialize cnt to 0\n          cnt = 0\n\n          read(*,*) n\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) a\n              idx = a + 10\n              if (idx < 0) idx = 0   ! Actually, the problem says a in [-10,10] so idx in [0,20]. So no need for bounds? but if a < -10, then idx<0? but the problem says. We can do:\n              if (idx < 0 .or. idx > 20) cycle\n              cnt(idx) = cnt(idx) + 1\n          end do\n\n          res = 0\n          do i = 0, 9\n              res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20-i)\n          end do\n          res = res + (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2\n\n          y = res\n\n          leap0 = is_leap(y)\n\n          total_days_mod = 0\n          j = y+1\n          do\n             leap_j = is_leap(j)\n\n             if (leap_j) then\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 2, 7)\n             else\n                 total_days_mod = mod(total_days_mod + 1, 7)\n             end if\n\n             if (total_days_mod == 0) then\n                 if (leap_j .eqv. leap0) then\n                     write(*, '(I0)') j\n                     exit\n                 end if\n             end if\n\n             j = j + 1\n          end do\n\n          contains\n\n          logical function is_leap(yr)\n              integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: yr\n              if (mod(yr, 400_8) == 0) then\n                  is_leap = .true.\n              else if (mod(yr, 100_8) == 0) then\n                  is_leap = .false.\n              else if (mod(yr, 4_8) == 0) then\n                  is_leap = .true.\n              else\n                  is_leap = .false.\n              end if\n          end function is_leap\n\n        Note: We write the final year without any formatting? but the original program uses println which is decimal. We use '(I0)' to avoid extra spaces.\n\n        But the problem says: behaves identically. The output is the integer.\n\n        This should be it.\n\n        Let me test with a small input for the first program? but the chain is long.\n\n        We trust the logic.\n\n        We output the entire Fortran program."
