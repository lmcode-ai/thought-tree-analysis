    "original_reasoning": "We are going to translate the sequence of three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The idea is that the output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n However, note that the original programs are independent and each reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n We are to chain them without intermediate I/O.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_67_B) reads:\n      n, k\n      an array bb of n integers\n\n    It produces an array aa of n integers, and then prints the array (each element incremented by 1) as space separated.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string (a number) and processes it to output an integer (bills).\n\n    But note: the output of the first program is an array of integers (each incremented by 1) as space separated string.\n    We need to convert that into a string without spaces? Actually, the second program expects a string of digits.\n\n    However, looking at the chain: the first program outputs integers (like \"1 2 3 ...\") but the second program expects a single string of digits (like \"123...\") without spaces.\n\n    This mismatch suggests that the chain as given might not be intended? But note the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n    How can we connect them?\n\n    Let's see the intended input for the second program: it is a string of digits (like \"1234\"). The first program outputs a sequence of integers (each in base 10) separated by spaces.\n\n    We must transform the output of the first program to the input of the second. The problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n    But note: the original chain would run the first program and then the second program, so the output of the first is the input of the second.\n\n    The output of the first program is a string of space separated numbers. For example: \"1 2 3\"\n\n    The second program reads a string of digits without spaces? Actually, the second program reads a single token (using sc.next()) which by default in Java Scanner is the next token (without spaces? actually, it breaks by whitespace). But wait, the second program reads the entire number string as one token.\n\n    How did the original chain work? The first program outputs a single line of space separated numbers. The second program reads a single token (the entire string until whitespace? but the first program outputs multiple tokens). This is a problem.\n\n    Actually, looking at the second program, it reads the entire string from the input. The input to the second program is a string of digits (without spaces). But the output of the first program has spaces.\n\n    This implies that the chain as given might not be directly compatible? Or we are misinterpreting.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"the entire sequence\". We must find a way to chain them without I/O in the middle.\n\n    We have two possibilities:\n\n    Possibility 1: The output of the first program is intended to be the input of the second program. But the second program expects a single string of digits. The first program outputs a list of numbers. We must combine the numbers by removing the spaces and converting each number to a string of digits? But note: the numbers in the first program are in the range [0, n-1] and then we add 1, so they are in [1, n]. Each number might be one or more digits? and then we have spaces.\n\n    Example: n=10, then we might have numbers from 1 to 10. Then the output string would be: \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\" -> which is a string of tokens. The second program would read the first token \"1\" and then the next token is \"2\", but the second program only reads one token (the entire string of the number is one token? but the input is multiple tokens).\n\n    This indicates that the chain is broken. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (including spaces and newline) is the input to the second program? But the second program reads a single token (the first token of the output of the first program). That doesn't make sense.\n\n    Possibility 2: The problem might have intended the programs to be independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? But that doesn't match the description.\n\n    After re-examining the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n    And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n    So we must design:\n\n      - The entire program reads the input for the first Java program (n, k, and array bb).\n      - Then it runs the logic of the first program to produce an array aa (and then the string that would have been printed: the array aa with each element incremented by 1, space separated and then a newline).\n      - Then we pass that string (without the trailing newline? or with?) as the input to the second program.\n\n    But note: the second program expects a string of digits (a number). However, the output of the first program is not a single number but a list of numbers. This does not match.\n\n    This suggests that the chain might be arbitrary? But the problem does not specify the order. It says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n    However, the order is given: File1, File2, File3.\n\n    Therefore, we have to assume that the output of File1 is the input to File2, and the output of File2 is the input to File3.\n\n    But the output of File1 is a space separated list of integers (as a string) and the input to File2 is a string of digits (without any non-digit characters). How can we reconcile?\n\n    We must reinterpret the chain: perhaps the output of the first program is meant to be the input to the second program in a different way? Or maybe we are missing something.\n\n    Looking at the second program: it is solving a problem about minimizing the number of bills for a payment. It takes a decimal representation of a number. The first program produces a permutation of [1, n]. How can that permutation be interpreted as a decimal number? It doesn't.\n\n    This indicates that the chain as provided might not be consistent. However, the problem says we have to chain them.\n\n    After careful thought, I notice that the third program (File3) is independent: it reads a string and replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts the occurrences of \"A\" followed by \"D\". The output of the second program is an integer (bills). The third program expects a string. So we have to convert the integer to a string? But the third program expects a string that may contain 'A', 'B', 'C', and then replaces \"BC\" by \"D\". The integer from the second program is a nonnegative integer. How would that integer be interpreted as a string of letters? It wouldn't.\n\n    Therefore, I suspect that the three programs are independent and the chain is not as the problem states? Or the problem might have intended the same initial input to be passed to each? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n    Given the confusion, I will re-read the problem: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n    So the chain is:\n\n        Input (for the first program) -> Program1 -> Output1 (which becomes Input2) -> Program2 -> Output2 (which becomes Input3) -> Program3 -> Output3 (final output)\n\n    We must design a Fortran program that:\n\n        Reads: the input for the first program (n, k, and the array bb of n integers)\n        Then runs the logic of program1 to produce Output1 (a string: the array of integers (aa[i]+1) space separated and then a newline)\n        Then uses that entire string as the input for program2? But program2 expects a string of digits (without spaces) for a number. \n\n    This is impossible without modifying the programs? But the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n    The original chain, if run as:\n\n        $ java codeforces_67_B < input.txt > temp1.txt\n        $ java atcoder_ABC155_E < temp1.txt > temp2.txt\n        $ java atcoder_AGC034_B < temp2.txt > output.txt\n\n    would fail because the second program would only read the first token from temp1.txt (the first number) and then the rest would be ignored? and then the third program would read the integer from temp2.txt and then try to interpret it as a string of letters.\n\n    Therefore, I suspect that the chain is not as the files are given? Or the problem has a mistake.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". We must do as the problem states.\n\n    Given the ambiguity, I will assume the following:\n\n      The first program (codeforces_67_B) produces an array of integers. We are to use the entire output string of the first program (including spaces and the newline) as the input string for the second program.\n\n    But the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a single token (the next token from the input) which is the first integer in the string? That doesn't match the intended input of the second program (a string of digits for a number). So the chain breaks.\n\n    Alternatively, we might interpret the output of the first program as a sequence of digits without spaces? But that would be wrong because the output has spaces.\n\n    After re-examining the second program: it reads the entire next token? Actually, the second program does:\n\n        String number = sc.next();\n\n    In Java, Scanner.next() reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). So if the output of the first program is:\n\n        \"1 2 3 ... n \"\n\n    then the second program would read only \"1\", and then the rest of the tokens would be ignored? That is not the intended input for the second program.\n\n    Therefore, I must conclude that the chain as provided is not consistent. However, the problem states we have to chain them.\n\n    How did the problem intend the chain? We are not told. Therefore, I will chain the programs as:\n\n        Step1: Run the first program on its input (n, k, bb) and produce the array aa. Then we form the output string as in the first program: a string of space separated values (each aa[i]+1) and a newline.\n\n        Step2: We then take that entire string (without the trailing newline? or with?) and remove the spaces? But the problem says without I/O and without modifying the logic. We are to run the second program on the entire output string of the first program.\n\n        However, the second program expects a string of digits. We have a string of space separated integers. We cannot change the second program's logic.\n\n    Given the deadlock, I notice that the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The same behavior as what? As running the three programs in sequence on the same initial input.\n\n    So if we run the three programs in sequence as separate processes, what would happen? The first program would read n, k, and the array bb and output the space separated list. The second program would read the first token of that list (the first integer) and then process it as a string of digits? and then output an integer. The third program would read that integer as a string? and then process it.\n\n    Example:\n\n        First program output: \"1 2 3\"\n        Second program reads \"1\", then processes the string \"1\" (which is a digit string) -> bills = 1.\n        Then third program reads \"1\" (as a string) -> replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", but there are no 'B' or 'C', so it counts: \n            s = \"1\"\n            tmp=0, cnt=0.\n            i=0: char '1' -> else branch: tmp=0.\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n    But that is not the intended behavior of the second and third programs? \n\n    Therefore, the chain is broken. \n\n    Given the confusion, I will assume that the problem intended the programs to be chained by having the output of the first program be the input to the second program in the exact string form (including spaces and newline) and then the second program is modified to read the entire line? But the second program uses sc.next(), not nextLine().\n\n    However, we cannot change the logic of the programs. We are to translate them.\n\n    I see only one way: we must run the programs as they are, and in Fortran we simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O by storing the intermediate results as strings and then parsing them as the next program expects.\n\n    But the second program does not read the entire line, only the first token. So we will take the first token of the first program's output and use that as the input string for the second program.\n\n    Similarly, the third program uses in.next() which would read the next token? Actually, in the third program:\n\n        String s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\n    So it reads one token.\n\n    Therefore, the chain in Fortran:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and the array bb (of n integers) for the first program.\n        Step 2: Compute the array aa as in the first program, and then form the string of the first token? But the first program outputs multiple tokens.\n\n        However, the first token of the output of the first program is the first number (aa[0]+1). So we take that first number, convert to string, and use that as the input to the second program.\n\n        But wait: the first program outputs all the numbers. The second program only reads the first token. Then the rest of the tokens are ignored. So we don't need to compute the entire array? \n\n        But the first program's logic computes the entire array. We must compute the entire array to get the first token? Actually, the first token is the first element of the array (aa[0]+1). How is aa[0] computed? It is computed in the loop from a = n-1 down to 0. We cannot avoid computing the entire array.\n\n    Therefore, we will:\n\n        Step 1: Run the first program's logic to get the entire array aa.\n        Step 2: The first token in the output is the string representation of aa[0]+1. We take that string and remove any leading/trailing spaces? and use it as the input to the second program.\n\n        Step 3: Run the second program's logic on that string (which is a string of digits) to compute the integer bills.\n\n        Step 4: Convert the integer bills to a string (without spaces) and use that as the input to the third program.\n\n        Step 5: Run the third program's logic on that string (which is a string of digits) to compute the final answer (a long integer cnt).\n\n        Step 6: Print the final answer (cnt).\n\n    But note: the original first program outputs the entire array. However, the second program only uses the first token. So we are effectively ignoring the rest of the array. Is that the same behavior as the chain? \n\n    Yes, because in the chain the second program only reads the first token and then the rest of the output of the first program is left unread. The third program then reads from the same stdin? but the second program has already consumed the first token and then the rest of the tokens remain? Actually, no: the second program runs to completion and then the third program starts. The second program does not read beyond the first token? because after reading the first token it processes it and then doesn't read more? \n\n    Actually, the second program does:\n\n        String number = sc.next();\n\n        and then it processes that string and then ends. It doesn't read the entire input. So the rest of the tokens from the first program are left for the third program? \n\n    But the third program then reads the next token from the same input stream? which would be the second token of the first program's output.\n\n    So the input to the third program is the second token of the first program's output? \n\n    Example:\n\n        First program output: \"1 2 3\"\n        Second program reads \"1\", then the third program would read \"2\".\n\n    This is not what we want.\n\n    Therefore, we must simulate the entire chain as if each program runs to completion and the next program starts with the entire output of the previous program as its input. But in the original chain, the second program does not read the entire output of the first program? only the first token.\n\n    And then the third program would read the next token? the \"2\". \n\n    This is very different from the intended behavior of the second and third programs.\n\n    Given the complexity and the fact that the problem might have a mistake in the chain, I will assume that the intended chain is to pass the entire output of the first program (as a single string) to the second program, and the second program is modified to read the entire line? But we cannot modify the logic.\n\n    Or the problem might have intended the programs to be chained by having the entire output of the first program become the input of the second program, and the second program reads the entire next token? but there is only one token? no, there are multiple tokens.\n\n    I see no clear solution. Given the time, I will make a decision:\n\n        We will run the first program and capture the entire output string (without the trailing newline) and then remove all spaces from that string. This will form a long string of digits. We then pass that string to the second program.\n\n        Why remove spaces? Because the second program expects a string of digits. By removing spaces we get a string of digits that is the concatenation of the numbers.\n\n        Example: [1, 2, 3] becomes \"123\"\n\n        This might be the intended input for the second program? It is a number.\n\n    Then the second program processes the string \"123\", which is the number 123.\n\n    Then the output of the second program is an integer (the number of bills for 123).\n\n    Then we convert that integer to a string and pass to the third program.\n\n    The third program will then process that string (which is a string of digits) and replace any occurrence of \"BC\" by \"D\", but there won't be any letters? only digits. So it will count: for each 'A' it increments tmp, and for 'D' it adds tmp. But the string has no 'A' or 'D'. So the result will be 0.\n\n    This is not very meaningful, but it is consistent in the sense of the chain.\n\n    Alternatively, if the third program is intended to process the output of the second program (which is an integer) as a string of letters? it doesn't make sense.\n\n    Given the confusion, I will follow the specification literally: we chain the programs by passing the exact output string of one to the next, and each program reads from the entire string as if it were the standard input.\n\n    How to simulate in Fortran without I/O? We will store the intermediate results as strings and then parse them in the next step as the next program expects.\n\n    For the first program to the second program:\n\n        The first program produces a string S1 (which is the space separated integers and a newline).\n\n        The second program uses a Scanner that by default uses whitespace as delimiter. So it will read the first token from S1. We must simulate that: we will extract the first token from S1 (by taking the first contiguous non-whitespace characters).\n\n    For the second program to the third program:\n\n        The second program produces a string S2 (which is the integer bills as a string of digits, and then a newline? because it uses println).\n\n        The third program uses in.next() -> so it reads the first token from S2 (which is the entire integer string without the newline).\n\n    Therefore, we will:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and the array bb (n integers).\n\n        Step 2: Run the first program's logic to compute the array aa.\n\n        Step 3: Format the output of the first program: a string that contains the list of numbers (aa[i]+1) separated by spaces and then a newline. But we don't print it, we store it as a string.\n\n        Step 4: Extract the first token from that string (which is the first number in the list). Convert that number to a string of digits? actually, it is already a number and we formatted it to a string. But we have the entire string. We need to extract the first token.\n\n        How to extract the first token: we can split by spaces and take the first part.\n\n        Step 5: Use that first token string (which is a string of digits) as the input to the second program. Run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n        Step 6: The second program produces an integer bills. Format that integer as a string (without any extra spaces) and append a newline? But the third program uses in.next() which ignores leading whitespace and reads until the next whitespace. So we can just convert the integer to a string and not include any space.\n\n        Step 7: Use that string (of the integer) as the input to the third program. Run the third program's logic: replace \"BC\" by \"D\" and then count the operations.\n\n        Step 8: Print the final result (cnt).\n\n    But note: the third program's output is the final output.\n\n    However, this only uses the first token of the first program's output. The rest is ignored. Is that the same as the original chain? \n\n        In the original chain:\n\n            First program writes the entire list to stdout.\n            Second program reads the first token from stdin (which is the first number of the list) and then the rest of the list remains in the buffer? but the second program does not read it. Then the second program writes an integer to stdout.\n            Then the third program reads from stdin: it will try to read from the same stdin which still has the rest of the first program's output? \n\n        But note: the programs are run in sequence. The second program is run after the first program has exited. The second program's stdin is the entire output of the first program (via a pipe). When the second program reads, it reads the first token and leaves the rest. But then the second program exits, and the pipe is closed. The third program is then run with a new stdin that is the output of the second program? \n\n        This is not how pipes work. When you chain with pipes:\n\n            program1 | program2 | program3\n\n        The output of program1 is the entire input of program2. The output of program2 is the entire input of program3.\n\n        So program2 reads the entire output of program1 (not just the first token) because the pipe delivers all the data. But program2 only reads the first token and then exits. The rest of the data from program1 is read by program2? or discarded? \n\n        In a pipe, program2 would read until it ends. If program2 only reads one token, the rest of the data from program1 is read by program2 and then discarded when program2 exits.\n\n        Therefore, in the chain, the entire output of program1 is available to program2, but program2 only reads the first token.\n\n        Then program3 only gets the output of program2 (the integer bills) and not the rest of program1's output.\n\n        So our simulation should:\n\n            - For program2: we only use the first token of program1's output.\n            - We ignore the rest of program1's output.\n\n        And then we pass the output of program2 to program3.\n\n    Therefore, we will do:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and bb (n integers)\n\n        Step 2: Compute aa as in program1.\n\n        Step 3: Format the first token: convert aa[0]+1 to a string. (But note: the first program outputs aa[0]+1 first. However, the output might have multiple spaces at the beginning? the program uses: print(aa[i] + 1 + \" \"). The first number is printed without leading space, then a space, then the next, etc. So the first token is the first number.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs the array in the order of aa[0], aa[1], ... aa[n-1]. \n\n        However, the program:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) print(aa[i] + 1 + \" \");\n\n        So the first token is the string representation of (aa[0]+1).\n\n        We can compute that token by converting (aa[0]+1) to a string.\n\n        Step 4: Use that string as the input to program2.\n\n        Step 5: Run program2 on that string to get bills.\n\n        Step 6: Convert bills to a string.\n\n        Step 7: Run program3 on that string.\n\n        Step 8: Print the output of program3.\n\n    But wait: what if the first token has more than one digit? We must convert the integer (aa[0]+1) to a string exactly as it would be printed.\n\n    This is acceptable.\n\n    However, note that the first program might output numbers with more than one digit? yes, if n is large.\n\n    We will convert the integer (aa(1)+1) to a string. (In Fortran, we note that aa is computed and stored. We can take the first element.)\n\n    But note: the first program's aa array is computed in a loop. The first element of the array is stored in aa[0] (Java) which in Fortran we would store in aa(1) if we use 1-indexing? but we can use 0-indexing if we want. We will use 1-indexing for Fortran? or 0-indexing? \n\n    Since Fortran can use arrays with any index, we will use 0-indexing to match Java.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use 1-indexing and adjust the indices. Let me translate the first program carefully.\n\n    The first program:\n\n        int[] aa = new int[n];\n        ... then it fills aa by inserting at position j the value 'a' (which goes from n-1 down to 0) ...\n\n        Then it prints: for i from 0 to n-1: (aa[i] + 1) and a space.\n\n        So the first element printed is aa[0]+1.\n\n    We will store the array aa with indices from 0 to n-1.\n\n    Then the first token is the string of the number: aa(0)+1.\n\n    Steps for the entire Fortran program:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and then an array bb of n integers (with indices 0 to n-1).\n\n        Step 2: Allocate arrays and compute aa as in the first program.\n\n        Step 3: Let token1 = aa(0)+1 (as an integer). Convert token1 to a string. This will be the input to the second program.\n\n        Step 4: Run the second program's logic on the string of token1.\n\n        Step 5: The second program produces an integer bills. Convert bills to a string.\n\n        Step 6: Run the third program's logic on that string.\n\n        Step 7: Print the result of the third program.\n\n    But wait: the second program expects a string that is a decimal representation of a number. Our token1 is an integer, and we convert it to a string. That is a decimal string.\n\n    The third program: it takes a string and replaces \"BC\" by \"D\". The string we pass is the decimal representation of an integer (like \"1234\"), which contains only digits. There are no 'B' or 'C' in it, so no replacement happens. Then it counts:\n\n        cnt = 0\n        tmp = 0\n        for each char in the string:\n            if char=='A', then tmp++\n            else if char=='D', then cnt += tmp\n            else, tmp=0\n\n        Since there are no 'A' or 'D', then tmp remains 0 and cnt remains 0.\n\n        So the final output is 0.\n\n    This seems to be what the chain would do.\n\n    However, this is a very specific interpretation. But given the problem's requirement, we proceed.\n\n    Let's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n    We must be cautious: the first program uses 0-indexed arrays. We will use 0-indexed arrays in Fortran by declaring:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: bb, aa\n\n    But Fortran by default uses 1-indexing. We can set the lower bound to 0.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use 1-indexed arrays and adjust the indices. Since the algorithm in the first program uses indices from 0 to n-1, we can use 0-indexing in Fortran.\n\n    Steps for the first program:\n\n        n = read, k = read, then read bb(0) to bb(n-1)\n\n        Then:\n\n            integer :: m = 0\n            do a = n-1 down to 0\n                j = 0\n                while (bb(a) > 0)\n                    if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n                        bb(a) = bb(a) - 1\n                    end if\n                    j = j+1\n                end do\n                do j_ = m down to j+1   [shifting: aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)]\n                aa(j) = a\n                m = m+1\n\n        In Fortran, we can simulate the insertion by shifting a section of the array.\n\n    We will now write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n    Note: We are not allowed to do I/O in the intermediate steps. We only read at the beginning and write at the end.\n\n    We will assume that the input to the entire Fortran program is the same as the input to the first Java program: \n        first integer n, second integer k, then n integers for the array bb.\n\n    The final output is the result of the third program.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Due to the complexity, we break down:\n\n        Module 1: The first program's logic.\n\n        Module 2: Convert the first element of the result (aa(0)+1) to a string.\n\n        Module 3: The second program's logic on that string.\n\n        Module 4: Convert the integer result of the second program to a string.\n\n        Module 5: The third program's logic on that string.\n\n        Module 6: Print the result of the third program.\n\n    We must be cautious of array bounds and loops.\n\n    Let's write the Fortran code."
