    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program outputs a floating point number (double) and the second program expects a string of digits. The second program outputs an integer (the number of bills) and the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's.\n\nBut wait: the first program reads an integer N and then N pairs of integers, and then outputs a double (the average total distance). The second program reads a string of digits. The third program also reads a string.\n\nSo the output of the first program is a double, which we must convert to a string of digits to feed into the second program? However, the second program expects a string that represents a nonnegative integer (or maybe a decimal number? but note the problem: the second program is for a payment problem). Similarly, the output of the second program is an integer (bills) which we must then convert to a string of digits for the third program.\n\nBut note: the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's (a binary string). However, the second program outputs an integer that might be in base 10 and not necessarily binary.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. We must reexamine the problem: the entire sequence should behave identically. So the input to the first program is the same as the original input to the first Java program. Then the output of the first program (a double) is passed as a string (exactly as printed) to the second program? But the second program expects a string of digits without any decimal point? The first program prints a double that might have a fractional part and might be printed in scientific notation? \n\nLooking at the first program: it prints `sum / N`. Since `sum` is the total of all pairwise distances (each distance is a double) and then divided by N (an integer). The output of the first program might be a floating point number with a decimal point.\n\nBut the second program expects a string of digits (for a nonnegative integer). How can we reconcile?\n\nAlternatively, note the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So we must mimic the exact output of the first program as the input string for the second, and the exact output of the second program as the input string for the third.\n\nHowever, the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) is designed for a problem about paying with minimal number of bills. The input is a string of decimal digits (without any decimal point) representing a nonnegative integer. Therefore, if the first program outputs a fractional number (with a decimal point) or in exponential form, the second program would break.\n\nBut the first program: the input is integer coordinates. The output is `sum / N`. The value of `sum` is the sum of all pairwise Euclidean distances. Then we divide by N. The problem context (ABC145_C) is about average distance of all permutations? Actually, note that in the first program, we are iterating over every unordered pair (i, j) with i != j, but we count each pair twice (once (i,j) and once (j,i))? Actually, we have two nested loops over N, so each pair is counted twice. Then we divide by N. But note: the problem says there are N! permutations? Actually, the problem is: there are N points and we want the average over all the permutations? But the problem ABC145_C is \"Average of All Pairs\". The sample input and output: \n\nInput:\n3\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n\nOutput:\n2.2761423749\n\nSo the output is a floating point number. How can we pass this as input to the second program (which expects a string of digits without any decimal point)? \n\nSimilarly, the second program outputs an integer (the minimal number of bills) and the third program expects a binary string (like \"0101\").\n\nThis chain does not naturally connect. Therefore, we must consider the possibility that the problem intends for the programs to be run independently on the same initial input? But the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example chain is arbitrary and we are to assume that the outputs and inputs are compatible? \n\nBut note: the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string of digits (representing an integer) and the first program outputs a double. This is a problem.\n\nWe must reexamine the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nThe original chain: \n  Input to first program -> Output of first becomes input to second -> Output of second becomes input to third -> Output of third is the final output.\n\nBut the first program outputs a double, the second expects a string of digits (integer). This is a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not as described? The three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nThis implies that the output of the first program must be in the format that the second program expects. Therefore, we must adjust the output of the first program to be a string that the second program can read? But the first program outputs a double and the second program expects an integer string.\n\nLooking at the context of the problems:\n\n1. ABC145_C: Average of all pairs of distinct points? Actually, the problem is: \"There are N distinct points. We consider a tour that visits all points in some order. What is the average distance of all possible tours?\" But note: the program does not compute that. The program computes the total of the Euclidean distance for every unordered pair (with both orders) and then divides by N. Actually, the number of pairs is N*(N-1) and we are counting each pair twice? So the average per edge? Then divided by the number of points? That doesn't match the problem.\n\nBut regardless, the output is a floating point number.\n\n2. ABC155_E: Payment without change. Given a nonnegative integer (as a string of digits), what is the minimal number of bills (only 1 and 10^k bills) needed to pay exactly that amount? The program reads a string of digits (base 10) and processes it.\n\n3. ABC124_C: Coloring Colorfully. Given a binary string, what is the minimal number of flips to get an alternating pattern? The program reads a string of '0's and '1's.\n\nTherefore, the chain as given cannot work because the output of the first is a double and the input of the second is a string of digits (without decimal point). \n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and we are to translate the sequence. We must find a way to connect them? \n\nAlternatively, there might be a misunderstanding: perhaps the programs are not meant to be connected by their outputs and inputs? But the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem intends for the programs to be run independently on the same initial input. But that contradicts the instruction.\n\nAnother possibility: the input to the entire chain is the same as the input to the first program. Then the output of the first program is passed as a string (exactly as printed) to the second program. Similarly, the output of the second program is passed as a string to the third.\n\nSo we must capture the output of the first program as a string and then parse that string in the second program. Similarly for the second to third.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program:\n\n1. We read the input for the first program (which is: integer N and then N pairs of integers).\n2. We compute the first program's output as a double, then format that double into a string exactly as the first program would print it (without any extra spaces, and with the same precision and formatting).\n   - The first Java program uses `System.out.println(sum / N)`, which by default prints the double in decimal format, and if the fractional part is zero it might print as integer? But we must mimic exactly.\n3. Then we pass that string to the second program. The second program expects a string of digits. But note: the double might have a decimal point and fractional digits. The second program is not designed to handle that. This might break.\n\nSimilarly, the output of the second program is an integer (printed as integer) and then we pass that integer as a string to the third program. The third program expects a binary string? But the integer from the second program is in base 10 and might contain digits from '0' to '9'. The third program expects only '0' and '1'. So the third program would break if it receives a string containing non-binary digits.\n\nThis chain is broken by design.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, I suspect the example chain might be arbitrary or for illustration only. Alternatively, there might be a mistake in the provided chain.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nTherefore, I will assume the chain is fixed and we must connect them by the string representations of the outputs.\n\nSteps for the Fortran program:\n\n1. Read the initial input (for the first program): \n   - An integer N, and then N pairs of integers (each pair on a line? or on the same line? The first program uses `nextInt` so they can be space separated or newline separated. We'll read from standard input.\n\n2. Process the first program: \n   - Read N and the coordinates.\n   - Compute the total distance (as described) and then the average (sum / N).\n   - Format the average as a string exactly as the Java program would print it. In Java, `System.out.println` for a double prints the number in decimal format, either in fixed or scientific notation, but without unnecessary trailing zeros. However, note that the sample output had 10 decimal places? Actually, the sample output \"2.2761423749\" has 10 decimal places. But the Java default for `double` is to print as many fractional digits as needed, but without scientific notation for moderate numbers. We must mimic the exact formatting.\n\n   However, note that the second program (atcoder_155_E) is designed to process a string of decimal digits without any decimal point. Therefore, if we pass a double with a decimal point, the second program would break. \n\n   This suggests that the chain as provided is not intended to be connected? \n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is intended to be an integer? But the average distance might not be integer.\n\n   Given the contradiction, I will assume that the chain is not logically connected and that the problem expects us to run each program independently on the same initial input? But the instruction says the output of each is the input to the next.\n\n   We must do as the instruction says: connect by the exact string output.\n\n   So the second program will read the string that the first program printed (which might have a decimal point and fractional part) and then process it. However, the second program's algorithm:\n\n   - It reverses the string and then processes each digit (from least significant to most). But if there is a decimal point, then the character '.' is not a digit and would cause an exception (in Java, `digits[i] = ... - '0'` would give a negative number for '.').\n\n   So the second program would crash.\n\n   Similarly, the third program expects a string of '0' and '1'. The second program outputs an integer (without any decimal point) so that would be a string of digits in base 10. The third program then processes that string: it would try to flip some characters to make it alternating. But the string might have digits from '0' to '9'. The algorithm would work, but the problem context is for a binary string. The third program is designed for a binary string? The problem ABC124_C is about a binary string.\n\n   Therefore, the chain is broken at two places.\n\nGiven the above, I suspect there is a mistake in the problem statement. However, as a faithful translator, I will proceed under the assumption that we are to mimic the exact string outputs and inputs, even if the programs are not designed to handle them.\n\nSo the Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the initial input for the first program (N and the coordinates).\n2. Compute the first program's output (a double) and convert it to a string exactly as the Java program would print it (with the same formatting).\n3. Use that string as the input to the second program.\n4. The second program will process that string (which might contain non-digit characters) and then output an integer (as a string).\n5. Use that integer string as the input to the third program.\n6. The third program will process that string (which is a base10 integer string, not necessarily binary) and output the minimal number of flips to make it alternating? But the problem was designed for a binary string. It will run, but the result might be arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might intend that the entire chain uses the same initial input string? But the first program expects an integer N and then coordinates. The second program expects a string of digits. The third program expects a binary string. They are different.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"on the same input\" meaning the initial input.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the chain is broken, I will instead translate each program independently and then connect them by the string representations of their outputs, as per the instruction.\n\nSteps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input for the first program. We must read an integer N and then N pairs of integers.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the average distance) and store it as a double. Then convert this double to a string exactly as the Java program would do.\n\n   How to format the double in Fortran to match Java's default? \n   In Java, the default printing of a double uses `Double.toString` which produces the shortest string that uniquely distinguishes the number, using either fixed or exponential form. However, the sample output had 10 fractional digits? Actually, the sample output for the first program was 2.2761423749. But note: the Java program does not specify formatting, so it uses the default. We can try to mimic by writing to a string with a suitable format.\n\n   We can use a format that writes in decimal with enough digits to avoid exponential. But the number of fractional digits might vary.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the first program outputs without any formatting. In Java, the `println` for double uses `Double.toString` which gives at least one digit after the decimal and up to 15-16 significant digits.\n\n   We can do in Fortran: write the double to a character variable with format 'G0' or similar. However, Fortran's formatting is different.\n\n   We might use: `write(str, '(G0)') avg` but this might use exponential for large numbers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a format that writes in fixed-point with 10 decimal places? But the sample had 10. However, the problem does not specify the magnitude of the numbers.\n\n   Since we are mimicking the first program, we should use the same formatting as the first program. The first program outputs the double as is. In Fortran, we can do:\n\n   ```Fortran\n   character(len=32) :: str1\n   write(str1, *) avg   ! This uses list-directed formatting\n   ```\n\n   But list-directed formatting in Fortran might add spaces and might not be the same as Java.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a format that writes with 15 decimal digits? \n\n   However, note: the sample output was 2.2761423749 (which is 10 fractional digits). But the actual value might have more precision.\n\n   I propose to use: `write(str1, '(F0.10)') avg` to write 10 fractional digits? But that would write 10 digits after the decimal always, which is not what Java does. Java trims trailing zeros.\n\n   We need to match Java's `Double.toString`. This is complex.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that the second program is not designed to handle a decimal point, I will instead assume that the first program's output is intended to be an integer? But it's not.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the second program (atcoder_155_E) is designed to process a nonnegative integer. Therefore, we must round the double to the nearest integer? But the problem doesn't say that.\n\n   I think the best course is to follow the chain as given, even if it breaks, by using the exact string output.\n\n   So we will format the double using list-directed formatting and then remove any leading spaces? And then pass that string.\n\n   But note: the second program might break because of the decimal point.\n\n   We are not responsible for the logical break, only for faithfully translating the chain.\n\n3. The second program will then read that string. The second program reverses the string and then takes each character and subtracts '0' to get a digit. We must do the same in Fortran.\n\n   But if the string contains a decimal point, then we will get a non-digit. We'll have to handle that? But the original Java program would crash. So our Fortran program should crash similarly? But we are to reproduce the behavior.\n\n   However, the Fortran program should not crash arbitrarily. We are to translate the algorithm.\n\n   Given the complexity, I will assume that the double output by the first program has no fractional part? Or that the input is such that the average is integer? But the sample input produces fractional output.\n\n   This seems impossible.\n\nGiven the time, I will proceed to translate each program independently and then connect them by the string representations, and hope that the input provided to the entire chain is such that the first program outputs an integer (so no decimal point) and then the second program can read it. But the sample input does not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is not as described and the three programs are to be run on three different inputs? But the instruction says \"the entire sequence\".\n\nI see no clear resolution. I will therefore translate each program into a subroutine and then connect them by passing the output string of one to the input of the next, and hope that the input to the entire chain is such that the first program's output is an integer string. Otherwise, the second program will fail.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the same behavior\". If the original chain would crash on the given input, then the Fortran program should crash similarly.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, we can try to mimic the Java program's behavior.\n\nFor the first program:\n\n   - Read N and the coordinates.\n   - Compute the average.\n   - Format the average as a string.\n\nFor the second program:\n\n   - Take the string from the first program and process it as a string of digits. But if there is a decimal point, we will get a non-digit character. In the Java program, that would cause `number.charAt(...) - '0'` to be a negative number or a number greater than 9. Then the program would proceed with that. In particular, when it sees a value greater than 9 or negative, it would cause the condition `digits[i] < 5` to be true for negative, and then `bills += digits[i]` would add a negative number? But that's not the case: the character '.' has ASCII value 46, so 46 - 48 = -2. Then we do:\n\n        if (digits[i] == 10) ... // false\n        if (digits[i] < 5) -> true, then bills += (-2)\n\n   So the second program would produce a negative number of bills? That is not intended.\n\n   Then the third program would get a string that might have a minus sign and digits? And then process it.\n\nGiven the above, the chain is not meaningful.\n\nBut we are to translate faithfully.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (for the first program).\n   Step 2: Compute the average as in the first program.\n   Step 3: Convert the average to a string (using list-directed write) and trim leading spaces.\n   Step 4: Pass this string to the second program's logic.\n   Step 5: The second program's logic will process the string (even if it contains non-digit characters) by reversing it and then for each character, compute `ichar(c) - ichar('0')` and store that in an integer array. We must be cautious of the string length.\n   Step 6: The second program will output an integer (which might be negative or large) as a string (by converting the integer to a string).\n   Step 7: Pass that string to the third program.\n   Step 8: The third program will process the string (which is the integer string from the second program) as if it were a binary string? But it might contain non-binary characters. The third program will count the number of flips required to make it alternating, but the string may contain digits from '0' to '9' and possibly '-'. The algorithm in the third program is:\n\n        It considers two ways: \n          a. Starting with the first character, then flip whenever two adjacent are the same.\n          b. Starting from the end, flip whenever two adjacent are the same.\n\n   It will work on any string, not just binary. But the problem context is binary.\n\n   Step 9: Output the minimal number of flips.\n\nGiven the above, the Fortran program will be long. We will use:\n\n   - Modules or at least subroutines for each program's logic to keep the main program clean.\n   - However, the instruction says: a single Fortran program.\n\n   We will not use modules for portability.\n\n   We will have to allocate arrays dynamically because the string lengths and array sizes depend on the input.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Part 1: Read the first program's input.\n      integer :: n\n      integer, allocatable :: pos(:,:)\n      read*, n\n      allocate(pos(n,2))\n      do i=1,n\n         read*, pos(i,1), pos(i,2)\n      end do\n\n   Part 2: Compute the average distance.\n      double precision :: total, avg\n      total = 0.0\n      do i=1,n\n        do j=1,n\n          if (i==j) cycle\n          total = total + sqrt( real(pos(i,1)-pos(j,1))**2 + (real(pos(i,2)-pos(j,2))**2 )\n        end do\n      end do\n      avg = total / n\n\n   Part 3: Format the average to a string.\n      character(len=50) :: str1  ! 50 should be enough for a double\n      write(str1, *) avg\n      ! Remove leading spaces\n      str1 = adjustl(str1)\n\n   Now, the second program takes a string (str1) and processes it.\n\n   Part 4: Second program.\n      We'll have an array for digits (size: len(str1)+1) to be safe.\n      We reverse the string.\n      Then for i=1 to len_trim(str1), we take the character at position len_trim(str1)-i+1 and convert to digit: digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n      But note: the string might have a decimal point and maybe a minus sign? The average is nonnegative? The distances are nonnegative.\n\n      The second program expects a nonnegative integer, but our string might have a decimal point.\n\n      We proceed anyway.\n\n      We allocate an integer array `digits` of size (0:L) where L is len_trim(str1)+1 (we index from 0 to L).\n\n      Steps of the second program:\n\n        bills = 0\n        digits = 0   ! initialize\n        ! We are going to store the reversed string in digits[0..len-1], but note: the original Java program also has an extra digit at the end (for carry). So we make the array with index from 0 to len(str1) (so size len(str1)+1) and set the last to 0.\n\n        do i=0, len_trim(str1)-1\n            j = len_trim(str1) - i   ! because we want to take from the end of the string (last character first)\n            c = str1(j:j)\n            digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, we have an array `digits` for i=0 to len-1, and we set `digits(len_trim(str1)) = 0` (as the next digit for carry).\n\n        nlen = len_trim(str1)   ! the length of the string\n        ! The Java program has an extra digit at index `nlen` (which we set to 0) and then processes up to index nlen (so i from 0 to nlen inclusive).\n\n        do i=0, nlen   ! note: the array digits has indices 0..nlen, and we set digits(nlen) might be set to 0 initially, but then we might update it.\n\n            if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                digits(i) = 0\n            endif\n\n            if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                bills = bills + digits(i)\n            else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                endif\n                bills = bills + 5\n            else\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        Then we convert `bills` to a string for the next program.\n\n        character(len=20) :: str2\n        write(str2, *) bills\n        str2 = adjustl(str2)\n\n   Part 5: Third program.\n        The third program takes a string (str2) and processes it to find the minimal number of flips to make it alternating.\n\n        It does two passes: \n          a. from left to right: \n             start with the first character, then for i=1 to len-1, if the current char equals the previous, then flip the current char (and count one flip).\n          b. from right to left: \n             start with the last character, then for i=len-1 down to 1, if the current char equals the next, then flip the next char (and count one flip).\n\n        Then take the minimum of the two counts.\n\n        Note: The third program in Java is for a binary string, but we'll do the same for any string.\n\n        We need two string builders: we can use two character strings of the same length.\n\n        Let s = trim(str2)\n        n = len_trim(s)\n\n        We'll create two copies: a and b.\n\n        a = s\n        count1 = 0\n        do i=2, n\n            if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n                ! flip a(i)\n                if (a(i:i) == '0') then\n                    a(i:i) = '1'\n                else\n                    a(i:i) = '0'\n                endif\n                count1 = count1 + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        b = s\n        count2 = 0\n        do i=n-1,1,-1\n            if (b(i:i) == b(i+1:i+1)) then\n                ! flip b(i) (the one on the left) in the pair\n                if (b(i:i) == '0') then\n                    b(i:i) = '1'\n                else\n                    b(i:i) = '0'\n                endif\n                count2 = count2 + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        Then the result is min(count1, count2)\n\n   Part 6: Print the result.\n\nHowever, the third program in the provided Java code does not flip the current char in the forward pass in the same way as described above? \n\nIn the forward pass (for a):\n\n        if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i - 1)) {\n            if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n            else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n            a1++;\n        }\n\nIn the backward pass (for b):\n\n        if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n            if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n            else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n            a2++;\n        }\n\nNote: the backward pass flips the left character (at index i-1) in the pair (i and i-1).\n\nBut in our Fortran code for the backward pass, we are flipping the character at position i (which is the left one in the pair (i and i+1))? Actually, the Java backward pass:\n\n        for (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n                ... flip at index i-1 ...\n            }\n        }\n\nSo in the backward pass, it checks the pair (i and i-1) and then flips the left one (i-1). \n\nIn our Fortran backward pass, we are iterating i from n-1 down to 1, and then comparing b(i) and b(i-1) and then flipping b(i-1). \n\nBut in the code above I wrote:\n\n        do i=n-1,1,-1\n            if (b(i:i) == b(i+1:i+1))   ! This is comparing i and i+1, which is not the same.\n\n        Correction: in the backward pass, the Java code uses:\n\n            for (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--)\n\n            then compares b.charAt(i) and b.charAt(i-1)\n\n        So we should compare b(i) and b(i-1) in the backward pass.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            do i = n, 2, -1   ! from n down to 2, so that we can compare i and i-1, then flip at i-1.\n            or\n\n            do i = n, 2, -1\n                if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n                    ... flip b(i-1) ...\n\n        But note: we are processing from the end backwards. The original string might be \"00\", then we flip the first character to '1', then the string becomes \"10\", which is alternating.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            do i = n, 2, -1   ! i from n down to 2, step -1.\n\n        But the original Java index: i goes from x.length()-1 (which is the last index) down to 1? Actually, the string has indices 0 to x.length()-1. In the backward loop, i starts at x.length()-1 and goes down to 1? Then it compares index i and i-1.\n\n        In Fortran, if our string is 1-indexed and of length n, then we want to compare positions i and i-1 for i from n down to 2.\n\n        So:\n\n          do i = n, 2, -1\n             if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n                 if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                     b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n                 else\n                     b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n                 endif\n                 count2 = count2 + 1\n             endif\n          end do\n\n   Part 6: Then we output min(count1, count2).\n\nGiven the above, we write the entire Fortran program.\n\nNote: We must be cautious of array bounds and string lengths.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\nWe assume the initial input is provided as:\n\n   first line: N\n   next N lines: x_i y_i\n\nWe'll read from standard input.\n\nThe entire Fortran program:\n\n   We'll use implicit none, and declare all variables.\n   We'll use dynamic allocation for the coordinates and for the digits array.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read N and coordinates.\n   Step 2: Compute the average.\n   Step 3: Format the average to a string (str1).\n   Step 4: Process str1 with the second program's logic to get an integer (bills) and then format that integer to a string (str2).\n   Step 5: Process str2 with the third program's logic to get an integer answer.\n   Step 6: Print the answer.\n\nHowever, note: the third program outputs the minimal number of flips (an integer).\n\nBut the entire chain's output is the output of the third program.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nDue to the complexity and potential for large strings, we'll allocate the digits array generously.\n\nWe'll write the program in free form."
