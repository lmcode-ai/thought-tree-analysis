But Fortran does not have dictionaries. We can use an array indexed by an integer representation. How to represent the string of 3 characters? The characters are in {'A','C','G','T'}. We can map:\n\n        A -> 0, C->1, G->2, T->3. Then a string of 3 characters is a base-4 number in [0, 4^3-1] = [0,63]. Then the state is (current, state_id) where state_id = 4^2 * (char0) + 4^1 * (char1) + 4^0 * (char2). Then we can have:\n\n        dp(current, state_id) = the number of ways. But note: the third program uses:\n\n        long dfs(int current, String last3) We'll write a recursive function with memoization? Or we can do iterative DP? Since N is at most 100, we can do iterative DP. Steps for the third program:\n\n        We are given an integer N (from the second program's output). We set MOD = 1000000007. We define a dp array: dp(0:3, 0:63) for the previous state? Actually, we can do:\n\n            dp(i, s) = number of ways to form a string of length i ending with the state s (a number in [0,63] representing the last 3 characters). But note: the state for the last 3 characters is only defined for i>=3? Actually, the initial state is \"TTT\", which is a string of 3 T's. But if N==0, then we don't have any characters? Then the initial state is \"TTT\" and we are at current=0? Then we want to count the ways for current=0 to N.\n\n        The original DFS:\n\n            if current == N: return 1\n\n            otherwise, for each char in ['A','C','G','T']:\n                form new_last3 = last3.substring(1) + char\n                if new_last3 (which is the last 3 characters) is valid (by the rules), then add the ways. We can do iterative DP:\n\n            dp(0, state0) = 1, where state0 is the state for \"TTT\". Then for current from 0 to N-1:\n                for each state s (from 0 to 63):\n                    for each char in 0 to 3 (representing A,C,G,T):\n                        new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char   [because s is a base4 number of 3 digits: the state is (d0, d1, d2). Then we shift: remove d0 and add char at the end -> new_state = (d1, d2, char) = (s mod 16)*4 + char? Actually, 16 is 4^2. So:\n\n                            s = d0 * 16 + d1 * 4 + d2. Then new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char = (d1 * 4 + d2) * 4 + char = d1*16 + d2*4 + char. But we can also compute by:\n\n                            new_state = mod(s * 4, 64) + char   ? But that would be:\n\n                            s * 4 = d0*64 + d1*16 + d2*4, then mod 64: we remove d0*64? Then we get d1*16+d2*4, then add char -> which is the same as above. Actually, we want to remove the first character and add the new char at the end. So:\n\n                            new_state = (s * 4) mod 64 + char   -> but wait: (s * 4) mod 64 is the same as (s mod 16)*4? Actually, 64 is 4^3, so mod 64 is the entire state. Then:\n\n                            new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char   -> this is correct. But then we must check the new_state (which is the last 3 characters) for forbidden patterns. How to check? We have a function isOK that takes a string of 4 characters?",

So we can read as:\n\n          character(len=10) :: ops(3)   ! but we only need one character per operator? We'll read tokens. However, the problem says: the entire sequence. We must read 4 integers and 3 strings (each string is one character). We can read:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: nums(4)\n          character(len=10) :: op_strs(3)   ! but we only care about the first character\n\n        Then we can extract the operator as the first character of each string. Alternatively, we can read:\n\n          read(*,*) nums(1), nums(2), nums(3), nums(4), op1, op2, op3\n\n        where op1, op2, op3 are character(len=*). But we don't know the length? We can use:\n\n          character(len=1) :: op1, op2, op3\n\n        Then read:\n\n          read(*,*) nums(1), nums(2), nums(3), nums(4), op1, op2, op3\n\n        This should work if the operators are given as single characters.

The first program (codeforces_55_B) reads 4 long integers and 3 strings (operators) and then uses a recursive function to compute a minimum value.\n 2. The output of the first program (a long integer) is passed as input to the second program (atcoder_ABC135_D). However, note that the second program expects a string (a sequence of digits and '?') from standard input. But the first program outputs a long integer. So we must convert the long integer to a string to feed the second program.\n 3. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) processes the string and outputs a long integer (modulo 1e9+7) which is the count of numbers in the string that form a number mod 13 = 5.\n 4. The third program (atcoder_ABC122_D) reads an integer N and then counts the number of valid strings of length N (with characters A, C, G, T) that avoid forbidden substrings. However, the output of the second program is a long integer, but the third program expects an integer N.\n\n But note: the chain is executed in sequence, meaning the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third.\n\n However, the input types of the second and third programs are not compatible with the outputs of the previous programs.\n\n Let's analyze the intended chain:\n\n Original chain in Java would be:\n   Step1: Run program1 -> reads 4 longs and 3 strings, outputs a long (min).\n   Step2: Run program2 -> reads a string (from stdin). But the input to program2 is the output of program1 (a long). So we must convert that long to a string and use that as the input for program2.\n   Step3: Run program3 -> reads an integer N. But the output of program2 is a long (which is the result mod 1e9+7). Then we use that long as the integer N for program3? But note: the third program expects an integer N (the length of the string to generate) and the output of the second program is a number that might be very large (mod 1e9+7) but the third program's N is at most around 100 (as per the problem constraints). However, the output of program2 is the count of numbers mod 13=5, which is a nonnegative integer less than 1e9+7. But the third program's N must be a small integer (like 100). \n\n This chain does not make sense because:\n   - The first program outputs a long integer (the minimum value from an expression with 4 numbers and 3 operators).\n   - The second program expects a string (which is a pattern of digits and '?').\n   - The third program expects an integer (N, the length of DNA string).\n\n Therefore, we must reinterpret the problem:\n\n The problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But note: the programs are independent and designed for different problems. Without additional context, we must assume that the chain is:\n\n   Input for the entire system: the input for the first program (4 longs and 3 strings) and then the chain continues.\n\n   However, the second program requires a string input. We are going to convert the long output of the first program into a string to feed the second program.\n\n   The third program requires an integer. The output of the second program is a long integer (mod 1e9+7). We cannot use that long as the input for the third program because the third program expects a small integer (like 100). \n\n This discrepancy suggests that the chain might not be intended to run the same way as the original problems. But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n Alternatively, we must consider that the entire sequence is to be run as one program, but the outputs of the previous steps are the inputs of the next steps. So:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (4 longs and 3 strings).\n   Step 2: Run the first program and get a long integer (min_value).\n   Step 3: Use min_value as the input for the second program: convert min_value to a string and then run the second program on that string? But note: the second program expects a string of digits and '?'. The min_value is a long integer so it is a string of digits. There are no '?' in it. Then the second program will compute the number of ways to interpret the digits (if there were '?' we would have multiple choices, but without '?' it's just one fixed number) modulo 13, and then count the ways that the entire string (without any '?') equals 5 mod 13? Actually, the second program counts the number of ways to replace the '?' by digits so that the number mod 13 is 5. But if there are no '?' then it will be 1 if the number mod 13 is 5, else 0.\n\n   Step 4: The output of the second program is a long integer (mod 1e9+7). Then we pass this long integer to the third program as the integer N? But the third program's N must be between 1 and 100 (in the original problem). The output of the second program could be any number in [0, 1e9+7). So if the number is greater than 100, the third program might run for a very long time and use a lot of memory? Also, the original third program is designed for N up to 100.\n\n This does not seem to be the intended chain.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n Since we are instructed to do so, we must:\n\n   - Read the input for the first program (4 integers and 3 strings) from standard input.\n   - Then run the first program's logic to compute the min value (as a long integer).\n   - Convert this long integer to a string (without any '?') and use that as the input for the second program.\n   - Run the second program's logic on that string to compute the number (which will be either 0 or 1, because there are no '?').\n   - Then take the output of the second program (a long integer) and use that as the integer N for the third program? But note: the third program's N is the length of the DNA string. The value we get from the second program might be 0, 1, ... up to 10^9+6. However, the third program's memoization table is of size (N+1) and the state is a string of 3 characters. For large N, this would be too heavy.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider: the problem states \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third. But the third program's input is an integer (N). So we have to use the second program's output (a long) as an integer for the third program. However, the third program's constraints on N (in the original problem) are that N is at most 100. But the second program's output might be very large. We have two options:\n\n   Option 1: We assume that the second program's output is within a small range (like 0 to 100) and then run the third program with that N.\n\n   Option 2: We note that the chain does not make sense for arbitrary inputs. But the problem says \"when run on the same input\", meaning the same input as the first program. Therefore, we must run the chain as described.\n\n However, looking at the first program: the output (min) is the result of an arithmetic expression on 4 numbers. The numbers are long integers, but the expression is built with 3 operations (each operation is either '+' or '*'). The result could be very large? But note: we are using long integers, which are 64-bit. The second program then converts this long to a string. The length of the string is at most 20 (for the absolute value). Then the second program runs a DP on the string of length L (which is about 20) and 13 states. So the DP table is 20*13. Then the output is a long (mod 1e9+7). Then we use that long as the N for the third program. But note: the third program's N is the length of the DNA string. The value we get from the second program might be 0, 1, ... up to 10^9+6. The third program uses recursion with memoization and the state is a string of 3 characters (so 4^3 = 64 states per N). The DP table would be of size (N+1) * 64. If N is 100, that's 101*64 states which is acceptable. But if N is 1000000007, then we cannot run the third program.\n\n This indicates that the chain as described might not be practical for arbitrary inputs. But the problem says \"when run on the same input\". We must assume that the input for the first program is such that the output of the second program (which is a long integer mod 1e9+7) is a nonnegative integer that is small enough for the third program to handle. However, the third program in the original problem only handles N up to 100. Therefore, we must have:\n\n   The output of the second program (the count mod 1e9+7) must be at most 100.\n\n But note: the second program outputs a count that is at least 0 and at most (if there are k '?' then 10^k). However, in our case, the input string for the second program is the string representation of a long integer (without '?'), so the count is either 0 or 1. Then the output of the second program is either 0 or 1. Then the third program will run with N=0 or N=1.\n\n Therefore, the third program must be able to run for N=0 or N=1.\n\n We will design the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Read the input for the first program: 4 integers (we'll use integers of kind=8 for 64-bit) and then 3 strings (each string is either \"+\" or \"*\").\n\n  2. Implement the first program's logic (the recursive function) to compute the minimum value.\n\n  3. Convert the minimum value (a 64-bit integer) to a string. Note: if the value is negative? The problem does not say the numbers are positive. But the first program uses nextLong() which can be negative. However, the second program expects a string of digits and '?' but we have no '?'. Also, the second program's algorithm is designed for nonnegative numbers? Actually, the modulus operation in the second program is defined for nonnegative. We must represent the absolute value? But the problem: the second program is for a string of digits that form a nonnegative integer? The original problem for the second program states: the string consists of digits and '?'. So we must convert the long integer to a string without sign? But note: the first program's expression: we have 4 numbers and 3 operations. The operations are addition and multiplication. The numbers can be negative? The problem does not specify. The original problem (codeforces 55B) states: the numbers are positive. So we assume nonnegative? Actually, the problem says: \"The input contains four integer numbers, each number is not less than -1000000000 and not more than 1000000000.\" So negative numbers are possible.\n\n   How to represent negative numbers? The second program expects a string of digits and possibly '?'. The negative sign is not handled in the second program. Therefore, we must consider: if the result of the first program is negative, then we cannot use it as a string of digits without a minus sign? But the second program doesn't handle minus. So we have a problem.\n\n   However, the problem statement of the first program (codeforces 55B) says: \"The absolute value of the initial numbers and the result of every operation does not exceed 1000000000000000\" (10^15). But note: the operations are only addition and multiplication. The result of the first program is the minimum value we can get by applying the operations. It might be negative? Then how do we represent it as a string for the second program?\n\n   The problem says: the entire chain must behave identically. But the second program does not accept negative numbers. Therefore, we must assume that the result of the first program is nonnegative? Or we must take the absolute value? The problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the original chain is not defined for negative outputs of the first program (because the second program expects a nonnegative number representation), we must assume that the input to the first program is such that the result is nonnegative? Or we must output the absolute value? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The first program outputs a negative number. Then the second program would read a string that starts with a minus? But the second program doesn't handle minus. It would crash? \n\n   We are in a dilemma.\n\n   Let me check the original problems:\n\n     First problem: \"Smallest Number\" on Codeforces (55B). The constraints: the numbers can be negative? The problem says: \"The input contains four integer numbers, each number is not less than -1000000000 and not more than 1000000000\". And the operations are addition and multiplication. The result can be negative? Example: (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) = -10.\n\n     Second problem: atcoder_ABC135_D - \"Digits Parade\". The problem says: a string S consisting of digits and '?'. The string S may start with '0' or even be empty? Actually, the problem states: \"The string may begin with '0'.\" But there is no mention of negative. So the second program expects a nonnegative integer representation.\n\n   Therefore, if the first program outputs a negative number, we cannot use it as input for the second program.\n\n   How did the original Java chain run? The first program outputs the negative number to stdout. Then the second program reads that string and sees a minus sign? Then it would throw an exception when trying to parse a digit? Because in the second program, when it encounters a character that is not a digit and not '?', it would break.\n\n   Specifically, in the second program:\n\n        char[] cs = sc.next().toCharArray();\n\n   Then it processes each character. For the minus sign, it would do:\n\n        int next = cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0';\n\n   This would be: '-' has ASCII code 45, so 45 - 48 = -3 -> which is negative, and then when used as the digit it would be out of [0,9]. But the program only checks for '?' and otherwise assumes a digit. So it would break.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid negative numbers. But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The first program does output negative numbers when the result is negative.\n\n   We have two options:\n\n     Option A: The chain is only defined for inputs that lead to a nonnegative result in the first program.\n\n     Option B: We modify the first program to output the absolute value? But the problem says \"behaves identically\".\n\n   We must stick to the specification: the entire sequence must behave identically. That means if the first program outputs a negative number, then the second program would crash? Then the entire chain would crash. In Fortran, we must mimic that.\n\n   But the problem does not specify that the programs run without error. So if the input causes a negative in the first program, then the second program will try to process the minus sign and fail (because it expects a digit or '?'). How to mimic that in Fortran? We could check if the number is negative and then crash? But the second program in Java would crash with an exception. In Fortran, we can stop with an error message.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the second program is only defined for nonnegative numbers. Therefore, we assume that the input to the first program is such that the result is nonnegative? The problem does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we will do:\n\n      - If the result of the first program is negative, then we convert it to a string with a minus sign at the front. Then in the second program, when we encounter the minus sign (which is at the first character, so the last in the reversed processing because we process from least significant digit?), we will have a character that is not a digit and not '?'. Then we must stop with an error.\n\n   But the second program in Java does not handle minus, so we will do the same: when we see a character that is not a digit and not '?', we skip? Actually, the Java program does not skip: it tries to convert every non-'?' character to a digit. So if we have a minus, it will try to compute:\n\n        int next = '-' - '0'  --> which is -3.\n\n   Then we do:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] ... \n\n   This will use a negative next? Then the modulus operation in Fortran for negative numbers might be different from Java.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid negative by taking absolute value? But that changes the behavior.\n\n   Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we must process the negative sign as the Java program would. The Java program would crash with an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds? Because base * next might be negative and then we take mod 13? But then we use the mod result as an index? The mod result in Java is in the range [0,12] for nonnegative numbers. For negative numbers, Java's mod can be negative? Actually, in Java, the modulus operation for negative numbers returns a negative result if the dividend is negative? For example: (-5) % 13 is -5. Then we use that negative number as an index -> crash.\n\n   Therefore, we will do:\n\n        In the second program part, if we encounter a character that is not a digit and not '?', we will stop the program with an error.\n\n   But the problem says: the entire sequence. We are to write one Fortran program that does the three steps.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the original chain in Java would crash. So we can crash in Fortran as well? But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we should crash.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify that the inputs are always valid. So we will do:\n\n        Step 1: Run the first program and get a long integer (min_value).\n        Step 2: Convert min_value to a string. If min_value is negative, then the string will start with '-'.\n        Step 3: In the second program, when processing the string, if we find a character that is not a digit and not '?', we will print an error and stop? Or we can check: if we have a minus, then we cannot process.\n\n   But the original second program does not check for minus and would crash. We can mimic the crash by not handling the minus and then we get an invalid digit (negative) and then we try to use it as a digit? Then we do:\n\n        next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')   ! for a minus, this would be negative.\n\n   Then when we compute: base * next, base is positive (base mod 13) so base*next is negative. Then we do (base*next + pre) mod 13: in Fortran, the mod function for negative numbers returns a nonnegative result? Actually, Fortran's MOD function returns a remainder with the same sign as the dividend. But we want modulus 13? We can use modulo(a,13) which returns a result in [0,12]. But the problem: the Java program does:\n\n        (base * next + pre) % 13\n\n   In Java, the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n\n        (-1) % 13 = -1   (if we use % operator)\n\n   But we want a nonnegative mod? Actually, the second program in Java expects nonnegative numbers. So we must avoid negative next.\n\n   Therefore, we will check each character in the string for the second program: if it is not a digit and not '?', then we output an error and stop.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        if ( (c < '0' .or. c > '9') .and. c /= '?' ) then\n            print *, 'Invalid character in input string for the second program'\n            stop\n        end if\n\n   Then if we have a minus, we catch it.\n\n   But the problem says: the entire sequence must behave identically to the original chain. The original chain (in Java) would crash with an exception. We are stopping with an error message. This is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to mimic the Java exception by not checking and then having an array index out of bounds? But in Fortran, we can set the index to (base * next + pre) mod 13, but if the mod is negative, then we use it as an array index? Fortran arrays must have nonnegative indices? Actually, the array dp is dimensioned as (0:12). So a negative index would cause a runtime error.\n\n   We can rely on that: if we get a negative next, then base*next might be negative and then mod 13 might be negative? Then when we try to index dp(i, mod_value) with mod_value negative, we get an out-of-bound.\n\n   But note: in Fortran, the modulo function:\n\n        MOD(-1, 13) returns -1, and MODULO(-1,13) returns 12.\n\n   We want the same as Java? Java: (-1) % 13 is -1.\n\n   So if we use MOD, then we get a negative mod. Then we try to assign to dp(i, mod_value) where mod_value is negative -> crash.\n\n   This is similar to the Java program: it would crash with a negative array index.\n\n   So we can do without an explicit check? Let the negative index crash.\n\n   Steps for the second program:\n\n        We are given a string S (which is the output of the first program).\n\n        We process the string from least significant digit to most? Actually, the Java program reverses the string:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') {\n                    ...\n\n        So the first character in the string (the most significant) becomes the last in the processing.\n\n        If the string has a minus sign, then the minus sign is at the beginning (most significant). Then when i=0, we look at the last character? Actually, the last character in the array is the least significant? So the minus sign would be at the first character, which is the last in the reversed order? Actually, the last character in the array is the last character of the string? So the minus sign is at the first character, so in the array it is at index0. Then when i=0, we take cs[cs.length-1-0] = last character? So the minus sign would be processed at the last iteration? \n\n        But note: the base starts at 1 and then is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each time. The processing goes from the least significant digit to the most. The minus sign is the most significant? Then we process the entire number as if it were positive and then at the end we have the minus sign? Then we try to convert the minus sign to a digit -> negative -> then mod -> negative index -> crash.\n\n        So we will not check and let it crash.\n\n   This matches the Java behavior.\n\n  4. Then the output of the second program (a long integer) is passed to the third program as the integer N. We must convert the long integer to an integer. But the long integer might be too big for an integer? The third program expects N as an integer (in the original problem, N is at most 100). The output of the second program is either 0 or 1 (because we have no '?')? Actually, it could be 1 if the number mod 13 is 5, else 0. Then N=0 or N=1.\n\n  5. Then we run the third program for N=0 or N=1.\n\n  6. Then output the result of the third program.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program structure:\n\n   - Read the input for the first program: 4 integers (as long integers) and 3 strings (each string of length 1? Because the operations are either \"+\" or \"*\", so one character). But we read them as strings.\n\n   - Implement the recursive function of the first program to compute min_value (as a 64-bit integer).\n\n   - Convert min_value to a string. We'll write a helper function for that.\n\n   - Then run the second program on that string to compute the result (a long integer mod 1e9+7). We'll use a DP array for the second program.\n\n   - Then take the result of the second program (a long integer) and convert it to an integer for the third program. But note: the third program uses N as an integer. The result of the second program is in the range [0, 1000000006]. We must check that it is representable as an integer? But in Fortran, integers can be 4-byte (default) or 8-byte. We can use integer(kind=4) for N? But the third program in Java uses int for N. So we can convert the long to an int? But if the long is too big, we might have overflow. We can do:\n\n          integer :: N = int(result_from_second_program)\n\n        But if the value is too big, we get an undefined value? We should check that the value is within the range of the integer type? The third program in Java uses int for N, which is 32-bit. The value from the second program is mod 1e9+7, which is about 1e9, which is within 32-bit integers? Because 1e9 is 10^9, and 2^31-1 is about 2.1e9. So it is safe? But note: the second program's result is at most 1 (if there is no '?')? Actually, if the string has no '?', then the result is 0 or 1. Then N=0 or 1.\n\n   - Then run the third program for that N.\n\n   - Then output the result of the third program.\n\n However, note: the third program in Java uses a recursive DFS with memoization. The state is (current, last3) where last3 is a string of 3 characters. The current goes from 0 to N. The state for last3: there are 4^3 = 64 possibilities. So we can create a DP table of size (0 to N) and 64 states. We'll use a 2D array: dp(0:N, 0:63) but we can map the string to an integer: base4 number? Or we can use a dictionary? But Fortran does not have dictionaries. We can use an array indexed by an integer representation.\n\n   How to represent the string of 3 characters? The characters are in {'A','C','G','T'}. We can map:\n\n        A -> 0, C->1, G->2, T->3.\n\n   Then a string of 3 characters is a base-4 number in [0, 4^3-1] = [0,63].\n\n   Then the state is (current, state_id) where state_id = 4^2 * (char0) + 4^1 * (char1) + 4^0 * (char2).\n\n   Then we can have:\n\n        dp(current, state_id) = the number of ways.\n\n   But note: the third program uses:\n\n        long dfs(int current, String last3)\n\n   We'll write a recursive function with memoization? Or we can do iterative DP? Since N is at most 100, we can do iterative DP.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        We are given an integer N (from the second program's output).\n\n        We set MOD = 1000000007.\n\n        We define a dp array: dp(0:3, 0:63) for the previous state? Actually, we can do:\n\n            dp(i, s) = number of ways to form a string of length i ending with the state s (a number in [0,63] representing the last 3 characters).\n\n        But note: the state for the last 3 characters is only defined for i>=3? Actually, the initial state is \"TTT\", which is a string of 3 T's. But if N==0, then we don't have any characters? Then the initial state is \"TTT\" and we are at current=0? Then we want to count the ways for current=0 to N.\n\n        The original DFS:\n\n            if current == N: return 1\n\n            otherwise, for each char in ['A','C','G','T']:\n                form new_last3 = last3.substring(1) + char\n                if new_last3 (which is the last 3 characters) is valid (by the rules), then add the ways.\n\n        We can do iterative DP:\n\n            dp(0, state0) = 1, where state0 is the state for \"TTT\".\n\n            Then for current from 0 to N-1:\n                for each state s (from 0 to 63):\n                    for each char in 0 to 3 (representing A,C,G,T):\n                        new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char   [because s is a base4 number of 3 digits: the state is (d0, d1, d2). Then we shift: remove d0 and add char at the end -> new_state = (d1, d2, char) = (s mod 16)*4 + char? Actually, 16 is 4^2. So:\n\n                            s = d0 * 16 + d1 * 4 + d2.\n\n                        Then new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char = (d1 * 4 + d2) * 4 + char = d1*16 + d2*4 + char.\n\n                        But we can also compute by:\n\n                            new_state = mod(s * 4, 64) + char   ? But that would be:\n\n                            s * 4 = d0*64 + d1*16 + d2*4, then mod 64: we remove d0*64? Then we get d1*16+d2*4, then add char -> which is the same as above.\n\n                        Actually, we want to remove the first character and add the new char at the end. So:\n\n                            new_state = (s * 4) mod 64 + char   -> but wait: (s * 4) mod 64 is the same as (s mod 16)*4? Actually, 64 is 4^3, so mod 64 is the entire state. Then:\n\n                            new_state = (s mod 16) * 4 + char   -> this is correct.\n\n            But then we must check the new_state (which is the last 3 characters) for forbidden patterns.\n\n        How to check? We have a function isOK that takes a string of 4 characters? Actually, the original function isOK checks the string last3+char (which is 4 characters). But we can also represent the 4 characters? Actually, the forbidden patterns are:\n\n            - \"AGC\"\n            - and also the patterns that can be formed by swapping adjacent characters? The rule: if by swapping any adjacent characters in the last4 we get \"AGC\", then it is forbidden.\n\n        But note: the function isOK in the original program:\n\n            boolean isOK(String last4) {\n                if (last4.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n                    return false;\n                }\n                for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n                    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n                    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n                    vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n                    String s = new String(vals);\n                    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                }\n                return true;\n            }\n\n        So we must check the last4? But our state is the last3. How to get the last4? Actually, the last4 is the last3 (which is the state s) and then the new char. But the last3 state s is built from the previous three characters. The previous three characters are the last three of the entire string so far. Then we add the new char -> we have a string of 4: the entire last four? Actually, the last4 is the entire state of the last three (which we stored) plus the new char. But the last three stored does not include the char we are adding? Actually, the state s is the last three characters. Then we add a new char, so the last four is the first character of the state s (which is the oldest) and then the next two and then the new char.\n\n        How to represent the last4? We can form the last4 from the state s and the new char:\n\n            Let the state s represent three characters: c0, c1, c2 (c0 is the oldest in the last three, c2 the newest). Then the last4 is: c0, c1, c2, c3 (where c3 is the new char)? But that is not the last four of the entire string. Actually, the entire string is ... (then the last four are: the character before the last three? and then the last three). We don't have the character before the last three stored.\n\n        We must reconsider: the state for the third program is the last three characters. When we add a new char, the last four is the last three (without the new char) plus the new char? Actually, the last three without the new char are the state s. Then the last four is the entire state s (which is the last three) and then the new char? That would be a string of length 4: the last four? But the state s is the last three of the previous string. Then when we add a new char, the last three become: the second, third, and the new char. And the last four is: the first of the state s (which is the one that was the second last of the entire string) and then the rest: the state s's second, third, and the new char? So the last four is: the first character of the state s, the second, the third, and the new char.\n\n        Therefore, the last4 is: \n            char0 = the first character of the state s (which is the oldest in the last three) \n            char1 = the second of the state s\n            char2 = the third of the state s\n            char3 = the new char\n\n        But note: the state s is the last three of the entire string so far. Then the last four is: the entire state s and the new char? Actually, the entire string so far is ... + (char0, char1, char2) and then we add char3. Then the last four is (char0, char1, char2, char3). But the last three of the new string will be (char1, char2, char3). \n\n        So we can form the last4 from the state s (which is three characters) and the new char.\n\n        How to get the four characters from the state s (an integer in [0,63]) and the new char (an integer in [0,3])? \n\n            Let the state s be represented as:\n\n                c0 = s / 16   (integer division by 16) -> then mod 4? Actually, we can do:\n\n                c0 = s / 16\n                c1 = mod(s, 16) / 4\n                c2 = mod(s, 4)\n\n            Then the last4 is: [c0, c1, c2, c3] where c3 is the new char.\n\n        Then we can check this last4 for forbidden patterns.\n\n        The forbidden patterns:\n\n            Pattern1: \"AGC\" -> which is [0,1,2] in our mapping? (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3)\n\n            Also, we must check the swaps:\n\n                Swap the first and second: [c1, c0, c2, c3] -> then check if it contains [0,1,2] in consecutive positions? Actually, the entire string of 4? We are only concerned with any consecutive three? The function isOK checks if the entire string (of 4) contains \"AGC\" in any consecutive three? Actually, the function last4.contains(\"AGC\") checks any consecutive three? So we must check:\n\n                    (c0, c1, c2) = (0,1,2) -> forbidden.\n                    (c1, c2, c3) = (0,1,2) -> forbidden.\n\n                and also the swaps:\n\n                    Original last4: (c0, c1, c2, c3)\n\n                    Swap at index0: (c1, c0, c2, c3) -> then check consecutive threes: \n                         [c1, c0, c2] and [c0, c2, c3] -> but note: we only swap adjacent, so the swap at index0: then the new string is (c1, c0, c2, c3). Then we check: \n                         (c1, c0, c2) and (c0, c2, c3) and (c2, c3) is not three? Actually, the entire string is of length 4, so we check consecutive threes: \n                         positions0-2: (c1, c0, c2) and positions1-3: (c0, c2, c3). \n\n                    Similarly, swap at index1: (c0, c2, c1, c3) -> then check: \n                         (c0, c2, c1) and (c2, c1, c3)\n\n                    Swap at index2: (c0, c1, c3, c2) -> then check: \n                         (c0, c1, c3) and (c1, c3, c2)\n\n                And if any of these consecutive threes is \"AGC\" (0,1,2) then we forbid.\n\n        Actually, the original function checks: if any of the swapped strings (the entire string) contains \"AGC\". So we must check all consecutive threes in the swapped string? But the swapped string is only one swap? Then the consecutive threes might be:\n\n          For the swap at index0: the swapped string is c1, c0, c2, c3 -> then we check:\n               substring(0,3): c1, c0, c2\n               substring(1,3): c0, c2, c3\n\n          For the swap at index1: the swapped string is c0, c2, c1, c3 -> then we check:\n               substring(0,3): c0, c2, c1\n               substring(1,3): c2, c1, c3\n\n          For the swap at index2: the swapped string is c0, c1, c3, c2 -> then we check:\n               substring(0,3): c0, c1, c3\n               substring(1,3): c1, c3, c2\n\n        And also the original last4: \n               substring(0,3): c0, c1, c2\n               substring(1,3): c1, c2, c3\n\n        So the function isOK returns false if any of these consecutive threes is (0,1,2).\n\n        Therefore, we must check:\n\n            original: \n               (c0, c1, c2) and (c1, c2, c3)\n\n            swapped at0: \n               (c1, c0, c2) and (c0, c2, c3)   -> but note: the swap at0 only swaps the first two, so the consecutive three starting at0 is (c1, c0, c2) and starting at1 is (c0, c2, c3)\n\n            swapped at1:\n               (c0, c2, c1) and (c2, c1, c3)\n\n            swapped at2:\n               (c0, c1, c3) and (c1, c3, c2)\n\n        And if any of these consecutive threes is (0,1,2) then we skip.\n\n        But note: the original function isOK also checks the original last4 (without swap) for \"AGC\". So we must check the original last4 for consecutive threes? That is (c0, c1, c2) and (c1, c2, c3) for (0,1,2).\n\n        Therefore, we must check 8 consecutive threes? Actually, the original function checks the entire string (the last4) and also the three swapped versions. But the entire string has two consecutive threes. And each swapped string has two consecutive threes. So total 4*2 = 8.\n\n        We can precompute a forbidden list for the last4? Actually, we are given the last4 as four integers (c0, c1, c2, c3). Then we form the following 4 consecutive threes (each consecutive three is a triple) from the original and the three swaps? Actually, we have 4 strings of length4? and each has two consecutive threes? So 8.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Check the original last4: \n                triple0 = (c0, c1, c2)\n                triple1 = (c1, c2, c3)\n\n            Check swapped0: \n                triple0_sw0 = (c1, c0, c2)   [from the swapped string at0: the first three]\n                triple1_sw0 = (c0, c2, c3)   [from the swapped string at0: the last three? actually, positions1-3: (index1,2,3)]\n\n            Check swapped1:\n                triple0_sw1 = (c0, c2, c1)   [the first three of the string swapped at1]\n                triple1_sw1 = (c2, c1, c3)   [positions1-3 of the swapped string at1]\n\n            Check swapped2:\n                triple0_sw2 = (c0, c1, c3)   [the first three of the string swapped at2]\n                triple1_sw2 = (c1, c3, c2)   [positions1-3 of the swapped string at2]\n\n            Then if any of these six triples (we have 8? Actually, we have 8: but note the original two and the three swaps each give two) is (0,1,2) then we skip.\n\n        Actually, we have 8 triples? Let me list:\n\n            Original: \n                (c0, c1, c2) -> triple0\n                (c1, c2, c3) -> triple1\n\n            Swap0: \n                The string becomes: s0 = [c1, c0, c2, c3]\n                Then the consecutive threes in s0: \n                    [c1, c0, c2] -> triple2\n                    [c0, c2, c3] -> triple3\n\n            Swap1:\n                s1 = [c0, c2, c1, c3]\n                consecutive threes:\n                    [c0, c2, c1] -> triple4\n                    [c2, c1, c3] -> triple5\n\n            Swap2:\n                s2 = [c0, c1, c3, c2]\n                consecutive threes:\n                    [c0, c1, c3] -> triple6\n                    [c1, c3, c2] -> triple7\n\n        So we have 8 triples.\n\n        We can check each triple: if it equals (0,1,2) (which is A,G,C? Actually, A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3; so \"AGC\" is (0,2,1)? Wait, no: A=0, G=2, C=1? Then the pattern \"AGC\" is (0,2,1). \n\n        But wait: the mapping:\n\n            A -> 0\n            C -> 1\n            G -> 2\n            T -> 3\n\n        Then \"AGC\" is A=0, G=2, C=1 -> so the triple is (0,2,1). \n\n        But the original program checks for \"AGC\", which is the string \"A\", then \"G\", then \"C\". So the triple (0,2,1).\n\n        Therefore, we must check each triple: if it is (0,2,1)? \n\n        However, note: the original program checks for the substring \"AGC\", which is the characters A, G, C in that order. So the triple (0,2,1) is not \"A\" then \"G\" then \"C\"? Actually, the triple (0,2,1) is the characters: A, G, C? Yes.\n\n        But wait: the triple (0,2,1) is the sequence: first character A, second G, third C. That is \"AGC\".\n\n        So we check each of the 8 triples: if it is (0,2,1) then we forbid.\n\n        Therefore, we can write a function:\n\n            logical function is_forbidden_triple(t)\n                integer, intent(in) :: t(3)   ! t(1), t(2), t(3)\n                is_forbidden_triple = (t(1)==0 .and. t(2)==2 .and. t(3)==1)\n            end function\n\n        Then we form the 8 triples and check.\n\n        But note: the original function isOK returns false if any of the consecutive threes in any of the four strings (the original and the three swaps) is (0,2,1).\n\n        Then in the third program, when we are at state s and we want to add a new char (c3), we form the last4: (c0, c1, c2, c3) and then check all 8 triples. If any triple is (0,2,1), then we skip.\n\n  7. Then we do:\n\n        dp(i+1, new_state) = dp(i+1, new_state) + dp(i, s)   [if the last4 is valid]\n\n        Then we iterate for i from 0 to N-1.\n\n        The initial state: at i=0, we have the state \"TTT\" -> which is (3,3,3). So the state_id = 3*16+3*4+3 = 63.\n\n        Then we set dp(0,63)=1.\n\n        Then we iterate for i=0 to N-1.\n\n        Then the answer is the sum over all states s of dp(N, s).\n\n  8. But note: the original third program uses DFS and memoization. We are using iterative DP. They are equivalent.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: MOD1 = 1000000007   ! for the second program\n        integer, parameter :: MOD2 = 1000000007   ! for the third program? But the third program uses 1000000007 as well.\n\n        For the second program: we use a DP array: dp(0:len-1, 0:12) for the states mod13? And the base.\n\n   Steps in Fortran:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program: 4 integers (as int64) and 3 strings (each of length 1? We can read as character(1)).\n\n        Step 2: Compute min_value (the first program) by recursion? But we can use recursion with mutable state? Or we can do iterative? The original uses recursion. Since there are 4 numbers and 3 operations, the recursion depth is 3 and the branching is 6, then 3, then 2 -> total 6*3*2 = 36? So we can do.\n\n        Step 3: Convert min_value to a string. We have to handle negative: if negative, then write the absolute value and then add the minus at the beginning? But we'll write a function that returns a string.\n\n        Step 4: Run the second program on that string.\n\n        Step 5: Convert the result of the second program to an integer for N (the third program). We use:\n\n                N = int(result_second)   ! result_second is in [0, MOD1-1]\n\n        Step 6: If N is negative, then set to 0? Or the third program for negative N? But the third program is defined for N>=0. And the second program result is nonnegative.\n\n        Step 7: Run the third program for N.\n\n        Step 8: Print the result of the third program.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We are to write a single Fortran program. We must not use any I/O except the initial read and the final write.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        program main\n          implicit none\n\n          ! ... declarations ...\n\n          ! Step 1: Read input for the first program\n          ! ... \n\n          ! Step 2: Compute min_value (first program)\n\n          ! Step 3: Convert min_value to a string S\n\n          ! Step 4: Run the second program on S -> get result_second (int64)\n\n          ! Step 5: N = int(result_second, kind=4)   ! use 4-byte integer\n\n          ! Step 6: Run the third program with N -> get result_third (int64)\n\n          ! Step 7: Print result_third\n\n        end program\n\n   We'll write helper functions and subroutines.\n\n   Due to the complexity and length, we break the code into sections.\n\n   We assume the following:\n\n        - The first program: the operations are either \"+\" or \"*\". We read them as strings of length 1? But the input might have spaces? We assume the input is given as: \n\n              number1 number2 number3 number4\n              op1 op2 op3\n\n          each on a separate line? Or on the same line? The original Java uses Scanner, which by default uses whitespace. So we read 7 tokens: 4 integers and 3 strings.\n\n        - We read from standard input.\n\n   Implementation details:\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: a, b, c, d\n          character(len=1) :: op1, op2, op3\n\n          read(*,*) a, b, c, d, op1, op2, op3\n\n        But note: the original first program reads 4 longs and then 3 strings. The strings are read as next(), which reads a token. The token for an operator is either \"+\" or \"*\", which is one character. So we can read as:\n\n          character(len=10) :: ops(3)   ! but we only need one character per operator? We'll read tokens.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. We must read 4 integers and 3 strings (each string is one character).\n\n        We can read:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: nums(4)\n          character(len=10) :: op_strs(3)   ! but we only care about the first character\n\n        Then we can extract the operator as the first character of each string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read:\n\n          read(*,*) nums(1), nums(2), nums(3), nums(4), op1, op2, op3\n\n        where op1, op2, op3 are character(len=*). But we don't know the length? We can use:\n\n          character(len=1) :: op1, op2, op3\n\n        Then read:\n\n          read(*,*) nums(1), nums(2), nums(3), nums(4), op1, op2, op3\n\n        This should work if the operators are given as single characters.\n\n   Given the complexity, we start coding.\n\n   Note: This will be a long Fortran program.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        module for constants and helper functions.\n\n   But Fortran doesn't require modules. We can put everything in the main program.\n\n   Due to the length, we break the code into sections.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        recursive subroutine util(arr, ops, idx, min_val)   for the first program.\n\n        function second_program(s) result(res)   for the second program.\n\n        function third_program(N_val) result(res)   for the third program.\n\n   And a function to convert int64 to string.\n\n   Let's begin."
