We also note: the second program might run for a while? but the starting year is the sum of k smallest numbers? \n        which might be as large as 200000 (if k is 1000 and each number is 200) -> then the year is 200000? Then we are iterating from 200001 until we find the next matching year? which is at most 28 iterations? So it's efficient. Let me test with a small example: Input: \n            5 3\n            2 5 9 1 3\n        Step1: \n            sorted: 1,2,3,5,9 -> sum first 3: 1+2+3=6. Step2:\n            start_year=6 (non-leap: leap0=false)\n            current_year=7: non-leap -> total_days=365 -> mod7=1 -> not 0 -> continue. current_year=8: leap -> total_days=365+366=731 -> mod7: 731/7=104*7=728 -> 731-728=3 -> not 0.\n            current_year=9: non-leap -> total_days=731+365=1096 -> mod7: 1096-1092=4 -> not 0.\n            current_year=10: non-leap -> 1096+365=1461 -> 1461-1456=5 -> not 0? \n            ... until we find:\n\n            Actually, we know that 6 and 12: \n                from 6 to 12: we have the years 7,8,9,10,11 -> 5 years? total_days = 365+366+365+365+365 = 1826 -> mod7: 1826 mod7 = 1826 - 1820 = 6 -> not 0. How about 6 and 17? Years: 7 to 17 (11 years): \n                    leap years: 8,12,16 -> 3 leap years -> total_days = 8*365 + 3*366 = 2920 + 1098 = 4018? 4018 mod7: 7*574=4018 -> 0? And 17 is non-leap? same as 6? -> so candidate. So when current_year=17, we break. Then output 17. Therefore, the entire program for this input would output 17. But note: the third program: \n        It would read the string \"17\", then count: \n            uppercase: 0, lowercase: 0 -> then output in lowercase: \"17\"\n\n        So we output 17 as an integer? without extra spaces? We use: write(*,'(I0)') 17 -> which outputs \"17\"\n\n  This matches.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The idea is:\n  1. The first program (atcoder_ABC171_B) reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers.\n     It sorts the array and sums the first k elements. Then it prints the sum.\n\n  2. The second program (codeforces_678_B) reads an integer y (which in the chain will be the output of the first program?).\n     But note: the first program outputs an integer (the sum) and the second program expects a year? \n     However, we must note that the output of the first program becomes the input to the second? \n     But looking at the original chain: the first program outputs an integer (the sum) and the second program expects a year? \n     This might not be compatible.\n\n  Let's reexamine the problem: \n    The entire sequence of programs is to be executed in sequence, with the output of one as the input to the next.\n\n  However, the three programs are:\n\n    Program 1: Input: two integers n, k and then n integers. Output: a single integer (the sum).\n    Program 2: Input: an integer (a year). Output: an integer (another year).\n    Program 3: Input: a string. Output: a string in upper, lower, or as is.\n\n  The problem is that the output of program 1 is an integer, which becomes the input to program 2 (which expects an integer, a year). \n  Then the output of program 2 is an integer (a year) which becomes the input to program 3? \n  But program 3 expects a string.\n\n  This chain is broken because the types don't match.\n\n  However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  We must consider the data types:\n\n    Program 1: Output is an integer -> printed as a string of digits? \n    Program 2: Input is read as an integer (from a string of digits) -> then it outputs an integer (printed as a string of digits).\n    Program 3: Input is read as a string.\n\n  So the chain is:\n\n    Input to the entire system: the input of program 1 (n, k and the array of n integers) as a string? \n    Then the output of program 1 (an integer) becomes the input to program 2 (as an integer, but we have to read it as a string and convert?).\n    Then the output of program 2 (an integer) becomes the input to program 3 (as a string).\n\n  However, note that the original programs are independent. We are to chain them without intermediate I/O.\n\n  How we will do:\n\n    We will read the input for the first program (n, k, and the array) from standard input.\n\n    Then we compute the first program's output: an integer (say, `sum1`).\n\n    Then we use `sum1` as the input for the second program. The second program expects a year? \n        But note: the second program is designed to read an integer (the year) and then compute the next year that has the same starting day of the week and same leapness.\n\n    Then we compute the second program's output: an integer (say, `year2`).\n\n    Then we use `year2` as the input for the third program? But the third program expects a string.\n\n    We have to convert `year2` to a string? \n\n  However, note: the third program counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. But if we input an integer (as a string of digits), \n      then there are no uppercase or lowercase letters? All digits. \n\n  So in the third program, if we pass a string of digits, then:\n\n      uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0 -> so it will output the string in lowercase? which is the same as the original.\n\n  But that doesn't change the string. So the output would be the same as the input? \n\n  This chain doesn't seem meaningful. However, we are to reproduce the behavior.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read n and k, and then n integers. Then sort the array and take the sum of the first k. (Output of step1: `ans1`)\n\n    Step 2: Take `ans1` as the starting year? Then we want to find the next year that has the same day of the week and same leapness? \n            The second program does:\n\n                It starts from the year `y` (which is `ans1`) and then iterates year by year until it finds a year `i` such that:\n                  - The total days from `y` to `i` (exclusive of `y`? inclusive of `y+1` to `i`) is a multiple of 7? \n                  - And the leapness of `i` is the same as the leapness of `y`.\n\n            Actually, the program:\n\n                Input: y\n                leap = check_leap(y)\n                Then for i starting from y+1:\n                  if check_leap(i) then add 366 else 365 to a running total `sum`\n                  when `sum` mod 7 becomes 0, then check if the leapness of `i` is the same as `leap`? \n                    if yes, output `i` and break.\n\n            So the output of step2 is a year (an integer) which we denote as `ans2`.\n\n    Step 3: Take `ans2` (an integer) and convert it to a string? Then the third program counts the uppercase and lowercase in that string? \n            But the string of digits has no letters? So:\n\n                uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0 -> then it will output the string in lowercase (which is the same as the original string of digits?).\n\n            Therefore, the output of the entire chain is the string representation of `ans2`.\n\n  However, note: the third program expects a word. But we are feeding it a string of digits. The program will work: \n        It will count 0 uppercase and 0 lowercase? Actually, wait: the digits are all in the category of not being uppercase or lowercase? \n        In Java, `Character.isUpperCase` for a digit returns false? Similarly in Fortran, we would check for letters? \n\n  Let me check: in Java, the `Character.isUpperCase` method returns false for digits. So the counts of uppercase and lowercase would both be 0.\n\n  Then the condition: \n        if (uppercase > lowercase) -> false\n        else if (lowercase > uppercase) -> false\n        else -> output in lowercase? which is the same as the input? \n\n  So the third program would output the same string of digits? \n\n  Therefore, the entire chain: \n        Input: n, k, and n integers\n        Output: the year `ans2` (as a string) without change.\n\n  But note: the second program outputs an integer (without any formatting) so the string of digits is exactly the integer.\n\n  Therefore, the entire program:\n\n        Read n, k and an array of n integers.\n        Compute the sum of the first k of the sorted array -> ans1\n        Use ans1 as the starting year to compute ans2 (the next year that has the same leapness and same day of the week)\n        Convert ans2 to a string and output it.\n\n  However, wait: the second program might not get the correct leapness? Because the input to the second program is the sum of prices? \n        and we are treating that sum as a year? This is arbitrary but as per the problem, we are chaining the programs.\n\n  We must note: the first program was designed for a problem about fruits, but we are using its output as a year? \n        It's the chain as given.\n\n  Implementation in Fortran:\n\n    We must combine the three without intermediate I/O.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      1. Read the first two integers (n, k) and then n integers.\n\n      2. Sort the array and take the sum of the first k -> this becomes the year for the next step.\n\n      3. For the second step:\n            - Write a function to check leap year: \n                  logical function is_leap(year)\n                      is_leap = (mod(year,400)==0 .or. (mod(year,4)==0 .and. mod(year,100)/=0)\n            - We start from the given year (ans1) and then iterate from next year (y = ans1+1) until we find the next year that satisfies:\n                  total_days = 0\n                  do i = start_year, ...   [Actually, the original Java program: \n                          for (int i = y+1; ; i++) { ... }\n                  ]\n\n                  We need to accumulate the number of days from the starting year (ans1) to the current candidate? \n                  But note: the original program starts at y+1 and goes until it finds a year i such that the total days from y+1 to i is a multiple of 7? \n                  Actually, the program starts at the next year and accumulates:\n\n                      year y+1: if leap then 366 else 365 -> add to sum\n                      then check if sum mod7==0 -> then check leapness of candidate i and the original year y.\n\n                  But note: the original year y is our ans1.\n\n            Algorithm for step2:\n\n                  y0 = ans1   [the year we start with]\n                  leap0 = is_leap(y0)\n\n                  total = 0\n                  i = y0 + 1\n                  do \n                      if (is_leap(i)) then\n                          total = total + 366\n                      else\n                          total = total + 365\n                      end if\n\n                      if (mod(total,7)==0) then\n                          if (is_leap(i) .eqv. leap0) then\n                              ans2 = i\n                              exit\n                          else\n                              ! continue\n                          end if\n                      end if\n                      i = i + 1\n                  end do\n\n      4. Then we convert ans2 (an integer) to a string. Then we output the string.\n\n  However, note: the third program does nothing to the string of digits? So we can simply output the integer ans2? \n      But the problem says: the entire chain must produce the same behavior.\n\n      The third program would output the same string? So we can output the integer ans2? \n\n  But note: the third program outputs the string in lowercase? which for digits is the same as the original. \n      So we can output the integer as we normally would? \n\n  However, the original third program outputs the string without change? \n\n  Therefore, we can write the integer ans2 to the output.\n\n  But wait: the chain of programs:\n\n      Original chain: \n          Program1: reads input and outputs an integer (say, 100)\n          Program2: reads 100, and then outputs (say) 200\n          Program3: reads the string \"200\", and then outputs \"200\"\n\n      So the entire chain outputs \"200\".\n\n      In Fortran, we can write:\n\n          write(*,*) ans2   -> but this might have extra spaces? We want to output just the integer without any extra space.\n\n      We can use:\n\n          write(*,'(I0)') ans2\n\n      This writes the integer without any extra spaces.\n\n  However, note: the first program reads multiple integers. We must read exactly the input that the first program reads.\n\n  How the input is provided:\n\n      The first program reads:\n          n k\n          a1 a2 ... an\n\n      Example: \n          Input: \n              5 3\n              2 5 9 1 3\n\n          Output of first program: 1+2+3 = 6\n\n      Then the second program uses 6 as the year? \n\n      Then the second program: \n          leap0 = check_leap(6): \n              6 % 400 !=0, 6 % 4 = 2 -> not leap -> leap0 = .false.\n          Then we start at 7:\n            i=7: not leap -> total = 365 -> 365 mod7 = 365 mod7 = 1 -> not 0 -> continue.\n            i=8: leap? 8%4=0 -> leap -> total=365+366 = 731 -> 731 mod7 = 731 mod7: 7*104=728 -> 3 -> not 0.\n            i=9: not leap -> total=731+365=1096 -> mod7: 1096 /7 = 156*7=1092 -> 4 -> not 0.\n            i=10: not leap -> 1096+365=1461 -> 1461 mod7: 7*208=1456 -> 5 -> not 0.\n            i=11: not leap -> 1461+365=1826 -> 1826 mod7: 7*260=1820 -> 6 -> not 0.\n            i=12: leap -> 1826+366=2192 -> 2192 mod7: 7*313=2191 -> 1 -> not 0.\n            i=13: not leap -> 2192+365=2557 -> 2557 mod7: 7*365=2555 -> 2 -> not 0.\n            i=14: not leap -> 2557+365=2922 -> 2922 mod7: 7*417=2919 -> 3 -> not 0.\n            i=15: not leap -> 2922+365=3287 -> 3287 mod7: 7*469=3283 -> 4 -> not 0.\n            i=16: leap -> 3287+366=3653 -> 3653 mod7: 7*522=3654 -> no, 3654>3653 -> 3653-3654 = -1? \n                    Actually: 3653 mod7: 7*522 = 3654 -> 3653 = 3654-1 -> mod7=6 -> not 0.\n\n            ... it might take a while.\n\n      Actually, the cycle of the days of the week is 28 years? But we are starting at a very low year.\n\n      We note: the next year that has the same leapness (non-leap) and the same day of the week? \n\n      The starting year is 6 (non-leap). The next non-leap year that is 7 mod 7 years away? \n\n      Actually, the offset must be a multiple of 7 days? \n\n      We know: the next year that has the same calendar? is 6+6 = 12? but 12 is leap -> so not same leapness? \n\n      Actually, the cycle is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (leap) -> then 13,14,15,16 (leap),17,18,19,20 (leap) -> then 21,22,23,24 (leap),25,26,27,28 (leap) -> then 29: \n          total days from 6 to 7: 365 -> 365 mod7 = 1 -> so Jan 1 of 7 is (Jan 1 of 6 + 1 day) mod7.\n          We want the same Jan 1 and same leapness? \n\n      We are accumulating the total days from 6 to 7, then 6 to 8, then 6 to 9, etc? \n\n      Actually, the program accumulates from the year immediately after the starting year (6) up to the candidate? \n\n      We want the total days from year 7 to candidate i? \n\n      Then when that total mod7 becomes 0, then the candidate i has the same Jan 1 as the starting year? \n\n      And we require the same leapness? \n\n      For 6 (non-leap) we require a candidate that is non-leap? \n\n      We are starting at 7 and going until we find one.\n\n      The first candidate that is non-leap and for which the total days from 7 to i (inclusive of 7? exclusive of i? Actually, we are adding each year as we go) is a multiple of 7? \n\n      Actually, we are adding the year 7, then 8, then 9, ... until i. So the total days is the number of days from Jan1 of 7 to Jan1 of i+1? \n\n      But note: the total days from Jan1 of year y0 to Jan1 of year y1 is the sum of the days in the years y0, y0+1, ..., y1-1.\n\n      So the total we are accumulating is for the years from 6 (the next year after 6 is 7) to i: that is the years 6+1 to i? \n\n      But we are including the year i? Actually, we are adding the year i as the last year? \n\n      The program:\n\n          for i = y+1 (which is 7) then we add the days in the year 7? \n          then we check at i=7: the total = 365 -> mod7=1 -> not 0.\n\n          then i=8: add the days in 8? which is leap? 366 -> total=365+366=731 -> mod7=1 -> not 0.\n\n          But note: the total days from 7 to 8 is 365? and then from 7 to 9 is 365+365? \n\n      Actually, the total we are accumulating is the days in each year starting from the next year (7) and then 8, then 9, ... until the candidate i.\n\n      And we check at each candidate i: if the total mod7 is 0 then we check the leapness of i? \n\n      So the total is the number of days from Jan1 of the starting year (6) to Jan1 of the candidate i? \n          Because: \n            Jan1 of 7: we have passed 365 days (the year 6) -> but the program does not include the starting year? \n            Actually, the program starts at 7 and adds the days of 7? So the total from 7 to i (inclusive of 7 and exclusive of i+1) is the days in 7,8,...,i-1? \n\n      But then when we are at candidate i, we have added the days for the years 7,8,...,i? So that would be the days from Jan1 of 7 to Jan1 of i+1? \n\n      We want the offset for the day of the week: \n\n          The day of the week for Jan1 of the next year (7) is (day0 + days_in_6) mod7.\n\n          We are accumulating the total days from 7 to i? Then the day of the week for Jan1 of year i is (day0 + total_days) mod7? \n\n          And we want that to be the same as day0? so total_days mod7 must be 0? \n\n      But note: the program does not use the day0? It only uses the leapness of the starting year? \n\n      And it checks when the total_days mod7 becomes 0? then the day of the week for Jan1 of year i is the same as Jan1 of the starting year? \n\n      And then we require the leapness of the candidate i to be the same as the starting year? \n\n      Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n      We must be cautious: the variable `total` might become very large? but the cycle is 28 years? so it won't be too big.\n\n      However, we can break the loop by limiting the iteration? but the problem doesn't specify bounds? \n\n      We note: the cycle for the Gregorian calendar is 400 years? but for the leapness and the day of the week? it repeats every 28 years? if the leapness pattern repeats? \n\n      Actually, the leap years repeat every 400 years? but we are only concerned about the leapness of the candidate and the starting year? \n\n      However, we are iterating until we find the next one? which is at most 28 years? \n\n      So we can safely iterate.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We will write the entire program in Fortran.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Program Chain\n          implicit none\n\n          !

We need a sort subroutine for integers\n          subroutine sort(arr, n)\n             integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n             integer, intent(in) :: n\n             integer :: i, j, temp\n             do i=1, n-1\n                 do j=i+1, n\n                     if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n                         temp = arr(i)\n                         arr(i) = arr(j)\n                         arr(j) = temp\n                     end if\n                 end do\n             end do\n          end subroutine sort\n\n        end program\n\n  But note: the third program is effectively skipped? because the string of digits has no letters? \n        So we output the integer ans2? \n\n  However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we are doing exactly the same computations.\n\n  We assume that the input for the first program is provided as the original (n, k and then the array).\n\n  We also note: the second program might run for a while? but the starting year is the sum of k smallest numbers? \n        which might be as large as 200000 (if k is 1000 and each number is 200) -> then the year is 200000? \n        Then we are iterating from 200001 until we find the next matching year? which is at most 28 iterations? \n\n  So it's efficient.\n\n  Let me test with a small example: \n        Input: \n            5 3\n            2 5 9 1 3\n        Step1: \n            sorted: 1,2,3,5,9 -> sum first 3: 1+2+3=6.\n        Step2:\n            start_year=6 (non-leap: leap0=false)\n            current_year=7: non-leap -> total_days=365 -> mod7=1 -> not 0 -> continue.\n            current_year=8: leap -> total_days=365+366=731 -> mod7: 731/7=104*7=728 -> 731-728=3 -> not 0.\n            current_year=9: non-leap -> total_days=731+365=1096 -> mod7: 1096-1092=4 -> not 0.\n            current_year=10: non-leap -> 1096+365=1461 -> 1461-1456=5 -> not 0? \n            ... until we find:\n\n            Actually, we know that 6 and 12: \n                from 6 to 12: we have the years 7,8,9,10,11 -> 5 years? \n                total_days = 365+366+365+365+365 = 1826 -> mod7: 1826 mod7 = 1826 - 1820 = 6 -> not 0.\n\n            How about 6 and 17? \n                Years: 7 to 17 (11 years): \n                    leap years: 8,12,16 -> 3 leap years -> total_days = 8*365 + 3*366 = 2920 + 1098 = 4018? \n                4018 mod7: 7*574=4018 -> 0? \n                And 17 is non-leap? same as 6? -> so candidate.\n\n            So when current_year=17, we break.\n\n            Then output 17.\n\n        Therefore, the entire program for this input would output 17.\n\n  But note: the third program: \n        It would read the string \"17\", then count: \n            uppercase: 0, lowercase: 0 -> then output in lowercase: \"17\"\n\n        So we output 17 as an integer? without extra spaces? \n\n        We use: write(*,'(I0)') 17 -> which outputs \"17\"\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: the original first program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: only the last block produces output. And the first two do not output anything? \n\n  We have combined the three without intermediate I/O.\n\n  We must be cautious: the first program reads from standard input and the third writes to standard output.\n\n  The entire program:\n\n      reads the input for the first program (n, k and the array) from standard input.\n\n      then writes the final result to standard output.\n\n  We note: the second program does not read from standard input? it uses the output of the first? \n      and the third uses the output of the second? \n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n      reads the input for the first program, \n      then computes the three steps, \n      then writes the final output.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: We assume the integers are within the typical range.\n\n  We'll use a bubble sort for simplicity? since the array size is at most 100000? \n      But the first program uses `Arrays.parallelSort` which is efficient, but the problem does not specify constraints.\n\n      The note: the first program reads n and k, and then n integers.\n\n      The constraints in the original problem (atcoder_ABC171_B) are: \n          1 <= k <= n <= 1000\n\n      So n is at most 1000. Bubble sort is acceptable.\n\n  We'll write the sort as a simple O(n^2) sort.\n\n  Code:\n\n      See below."
