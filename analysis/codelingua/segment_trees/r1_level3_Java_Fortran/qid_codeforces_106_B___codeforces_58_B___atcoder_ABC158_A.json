Then the second program will run from 99 down to 1? and the divisors of 100? But actually, we start with ans1 (which is at most 100) and then we update m to the divisors. The divisors of 100: 100, 50, 25, 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1? But the program does:\n\n            m = ans1\n            for i from m-1 down to 1:\n                if m % i == 0, then print i and set m = i. So it doesn't necessarily get all divisors? It gets the next divisor that is one less than the current m? Example: \n            Start: m=10\n            i=9 -> 10 % 9 ! =0 -> skip\n            i=8 -> 10%8 ! =0 -> skip\n            i=7 -> skip\n            i=6 -> skip\n            i=5 -> 10%5==0 -> then set m=5, then next i from 4 down to 1: \n                i=4: 5%4 ! =0\n                i=3: skip\n                i=2: skip\n                i=1: 5%1==0 -> then set m=1, then the loop ends? because then i becomes 0? So the output for 10 is:\n            10 \n            5 \n            1 The divisors found are 5 and 1. The number of divisors we output is at most the number of prime factors? Actually, it's the chain of divisors we find by decreasing the denominator. The total number of divisors we output is O(log n). So the entire string is not too long. Therefore, we can build the entire string. Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then n quadruples (4 integers per line). Step 2: Run the first program's logic to compute `ans1` (an integer). Step 3: \n            m = ans1\n            str2 = ''   ! we'll build the entire output string of the second program. First, convert `m` to a string and append a space and a newline. Then, for i = m-1 down to 1:\n                if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                    convert `i` to a string, append a space and a newline to it, and then append that to `str2`. set m = i   (so that we continue with the new m) Now, we have the entire output string `str2`. Step 4: Extract the first token from `str2`. How?\n\n            The first token is the first sequence of non-whitespace characters. We can:\n\n                skip leading whitespace (if any) -> but the first character should be non-whitespace. then take until the next whitespace. But note: the first part we built: the integer `ans1` (without any leading space) and then a space. So the first token is the entire integer string. We can also note: we built the first part as: \n                s = integer_to_string(ans1) // ' ' // new_line('a') The new_line is a non-printable? Actually, we used a character for newline. We can represent newline as char(10).",

So we can just convert `ans1` to a string again and use that? But to be consistent with the entire output string, we should extract from `str2`. We can:\n\n                idx = 1\n                token = ''\n                do while (idx <= len(str2) .and. str2(idx:idx) /= ' ' .and. str2(idx:idx) /= char(10) .and. str2(idx:idx) /= char(9)) token = token // str2(idx:idx)\n                    idx = idx + 1\n                end do\n\n            But note: the integer might be negative? But in our case, it's positive. Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `index` function to find the first space or newline? Since we built the string, we know the first token is the first integer. We can simply use:\n\n                pos = index(str2, ' ')   ! find the first space\n                if (pos > 0) then\n                    token = str2(1:pos-1)\n                else\n                    ! if there's no space? then the entire string is the token? token = str2\n                end if\n\n            But note: we appended a space right after the integer. So the first space is at the end of the integer string. So token = str2(1:index(str2,' ')-1) Step 5: Check token for containing 'A' and 'B'. if (index(token, 'A') > 0 .and. index(token, 'B') > 0) then\n                output = 'Yes'\n            else\n                output = 'No'\n            end if\n\n        Step 6: Print output.

Then it finds a laptop that is not outdated (i.e., there is no other laptop that has higher speed, ram, and hdd). Then among these, it picks the one with the smallest price. The answer is the index (starting at 1). So the index is between 1 and n (n<=100). So the integer is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the token is a string of at most 3 digits (if n=100, then 100). So the token will never contain a letter. Therefore, the output is always \"No\". But we must code the entire chain. Let's code accordingly. We need helper functions to convert integers to strings? We can do:\n\n        subroutine int_to_string(i, s)\n            integer, intent(in) :: i\n            character(len=*), intent(out) :: s\n            write(s, '(I0)') i\n        end subroutine\n\n   But we don't know the length? We can use internal files. Alternatively, we can write a function that returns a string. We'll use:\n\n        function int2str(i) result(s)\n            integer, intent(in) :: i\n            character(len=32) :: buf   ! big enough for integers\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n            write(buf, *) i\n            s = trim(adjustl(buf))\n        end function\n\n   But note: the integer is positive and at most 100, so we can use:\n\n        write(buf, '(I10)') i   -> then adjustl and trim. However, Fortran 95 doesn't have allocatable strings? We are writing in fixed-form? Actually, we can use Fortran 2003 features? But the problem doesn't specify. We'll assume we can use Fortran 2003. Alternatively, we can avoid allocatable strings by pre-defining fixed-length strings?",

Then we continue the loop with the same i? Actually, the loop variable i continues to decrease. Example: \n            Start: n=10 -> m=10\n            i=9 -> 10 mod 9 ! =0 -> skip\n            i=8 -> skip\n            ... until i=5: 10 mod 5==0 -> then set m=5, then the next i is 4 (because i decreases to 4, then 3, then 2, then 1). Then for m=5, we check i from 4 down to 1: \n                i=4: 5 mod 4 ! =0\n                i=3: no\n                i=2: no\n                i=1: 5 mod 1==0 -> then print 1 and set m=1. So we must update m to i, and then continue the loop with the next i (which is i-1). We are doing that. But note: the string building: we are appending the divisor and then a space and a newline. The original second program uses println, so that's correct. However, the original second program prints the initial n and a space (without a newline?",

So it is one character. Then total length: \n            100: 3 + 2 = 5\n            50: 2+2=4\n            ... until 1: 1+2=3\n            total = 5+4+4+4+4+3+3+3 = 30? So 500 is plenty. Therefore, we are safe. But note: the token extraction: we are using a fixed-length string for token? We defined token as character(len=500). But the token is at most 3 characters. So we can use:\n\n        character(len=10) :: token   ! 10 is enough for integers up to 100. Similarly, we can use a fixed-length buffer for temp_str.\n\n   Let me revise:\n\n        We'll use:\n            character(len=500) :: str2   ! for the entire output of the second program\n            character(len=10) :: token   ! for the first token\n\n        And for converting integers, we can use a fixed buffer:\n\n            character(len=10) :: temp_str   ! for each integer\n\n   Then:\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I10)') m   ! I10 is enough for integers up to 10^10, but we have at most 100 -> so 3 digits. temp_str = adjustl(temp_str)   ! left adjusted\n\n   Then when we do:\n\n        str2 = trim(str2) // trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n   But note: the length of str2 is fixed at 500. We are assigning a new value. The new value must not exceed 500. How to build without fixed-length? We can use allocatable character and then reallocate? But that is more complex. Alternatively, we can use a loop and track the current length? Since the maximum length is small (about 30), we can do:\n\n        str2 = ''   ! initialize to empty\n\n        Then for each part we want to append:\n\n            part = trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n            new_str = trim(str2) // part   ! but new_str must be stored in a variable that can grow? We can do: str2 = trim(str2) // trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n        and hope that the fixed-length 500 is enough. We'll use fixed-length for simplicity. Finally, the program. Note: we are using new_line('a') to get the newline character. This is standard. Let me write the complete program. We'll use free-form Fortran.",

Use `ans` as the input to the second program (which will generate a sequence of integers in a specific pattern).\n    d. Capture the entire output of the second program as a string (without actually printing it until the very end? But note the requirement: only the last block should produce output).\n    e. Then, the third program takes that string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. However, note the output of the second program is a string of digits and spaces. It does not contain the letter 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the third program will always output \"No\" in this chain? \n\n Let me reexamine:\n\n The third program (File3) is:\n      String s = in.next();\n      if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) ... \n\n But the output of File2 is a string of numbers and spaces. There are no letters. So the condition will never be true? \n\n However, note: the original programs are independent. We are chaining the output of one to the input of the next. \n\n But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning we run the first program on its input, then the second on the output of the first, then the third on the output of the second.\n\n However, the third program was originally designed for a different problem. But in the chain, the input to the third program is the string of numbers from the second program.\n\n Therefore, we must design the Fortran program as:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (for the first program).\n   Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (an integer, say `ans1`).\n   Step 3: Use `ans1` as the input to the second program. The second program produces a string (which is the sequence of integers separated by spaces). We need to form this string without printing it.\n   Step 4: Then, the third program will take that string and check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. But note: the string is made of digits and spaces. It will not contain 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the output of the third program will be \"No\".\n\n However, let me check the original programs:\n\n   Program 1: \n        Input: \n            n\n            then n lines of 4 integers each.\n\n        Output: an integer.\n\n   Program 2:\n        Input: an integer (which is the output of program1).\n        Output: a sequence of integers (the first being the input, then divisors in descending order that divide the current number until we hit 1). For example, if input is 10, then output is \"10 5 1 \" (note: the example in the code prints with a space at the end).\n\n   Program 3:\n        Input: a string (which is the entire output of program2, including the spaces).\n        Output: \"Yes\" if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', else \"No\".\n\n Since the string from program2 is digits and spaces, it does not contain 'A' or 'B'. So the output of the entire chain is \"No\".\n\n But wait: what if the integer in program2 is 65? Then the string would have '6' and '5' and then a space. Still no 'A'. Similarly, 66 is '6','6'. \n\n Therefore, the output of the entire chain is always \"No\".\n\n However, we must code the chain as described.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We are not allowed to do I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read the initial input (n, then n quadruples).\n\n   2. Run the logic of the first program to get `ans` (which is an index, then we use that index to get the price and then the answer is the index+1 that meets the condition). Let the result of the first program be `ans1` (an integer).\n\n   3. For the second program, we are going to simulate the output as a string without printing it. We start with the integer `ans1` and then traverse from `ans1-1` down to 1. Whenever we find a divisor (i.e., when `m % i == 0`), we update `m` to `i` and then we add the integer `i` to the string. We build a string that starts with `ans1` and then the divisors in descending order.\n\n   4. Then, we take that string and check: does it contain both 'A' and 'B'? Since it won't, we set the result for the third program to \"No\".\n\n   5. Finally, we output that string (\"No\").\n\n However, note: the original second program prints each integer with a space. So we build the string by converting integers to strings and appending a space.\n\n But note: the third program in Java uses `in.next()`. The `next()` method of Scanner reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). However, the entire output of the second program is one long string of tokens separated by spaces? Actually, the second program prints:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   --> This prints n and then a space and then a newline? Actually, `println` adds a newline.\n\n        Then inside the loop: `System.out.println(i + \" \");` -> each prints an integer, a space, and a newline.\n\n   But wait: the second program uses `println` for every number. So the output is:\n\n        n + \" \" + \"\\n\"\n        then for each divisor: i + \" \" + \"\\n\"\n\n   So the entire output is multiple lines.\n\n   However, the third program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token (without the whitespace). So the first token would be the first number (as a string). But note: the condition in the third program is:\n\n        if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\"))\n\n   Here, `s` is the first token? Because `in.next()` only reads the first token. So the rest of the output of the second program is ignored.\n\n   This changes the behavior. The third program only sees the first token (the initial integer `n`).\n\n   Therefore, we must reconsider the chaining:\n\n   The second program outputs:\n\n        10 \n        5 \n        1 \n\n   But if we use `in.next()` in the third program, it reads \"10\". Then we check: does \"10\" contain both 'A' and 'B'? It does not.\n\n   However, the original chain is:\n\n        Program1 outputs: 10   (without any extra spaces? Actually, the first program outputs the integer and then a newline.)\n\n        Then program2 is run with input 10. It outputs:\n\n            10 \n            5 \n            1 \n\n        Then program3 is run with that entire output as its input. But the third program only reads the first token? So it reads the string \"10\".\n\n   Therefore, we only need the first token of the second program's output for the third program.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the first token of the second program's output is exactly the integer we got from the first program (which is `ans1`). So we can simply use the string representation of `ans1` for the third program? \n\n   However, the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next. The entire output of the second program is the input to the third. But the third program only reads the first token. So effectively, the rest of the output of the second program is ignored.\n\n   Therefore, in the Fortran program, we can do:\n\n      Step 3: Build the entire output string of the second program (with newlines) but then for the third program, we only take the first token (which is the initial integer) to form a string? \n\n   But note: the third program uses `in.next()`, which reads the next token (the first one). So we can simply use the integer `ans1` converted to a string and check that string? \n\n   However, the problem says: we must reproduce the same behavior. The behavior of the second program is to output multiple lines, but the third program only reads the first token. So we can simulate by taking the string representation of `ans1` (without any newline) as the input to the third program.\n\n   Alternatively, we could build the entire output string and then extract the first token? But that is more complicated.\n\n   Given that the third program only uses the first token, we can use just the string of the integer `ans1` for the third program.\n\n   Therefore, the chain:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the quadruples -> compute ans1 (integer).\n        Step 2: The input to the third program is the string of the first token of the second program's output, which is the string representation of ans1.\n\n        Then check: does that string contain 'A' and 'B'? (It won't, so output \"No\").\n\n   But wait: what if the integer `ans1` is 65? The string would be \"65\". It does not contain the letter 'A'. It contains the digit '6' and '5'. Similarly, 10 is \"10\", which has '1' and '0'. \n\n   Therefore, we can avoid generating the entire output of the second program for the purpose of the third program? \n\n   However, note: the problem says to translate the entire sequence. The second program does run and produce a full output. But the third program only reads the first token. So we don't need to build the entire string for the second program's output? We only need the first token for the next stage.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The entire output is passed. However, the third program only consumes the first token. The rest of the output is left unread. But in Fortran, we are simulating without I/O. We are not actually running separate programs. We are combining the logic.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        We run the first program -> get ans1.\n\n        We then run the second program's logic on ans1, but we do not actually build the entire string? We only need the first token for the next program? \n\n        However, the second program's logic does not affect the state beyond producing the output. So we can skip building the entire output string? We only need the first token (which is the string representation of ans1) for the third program.\n\n   But note: the second program does not modify the integer `ans1` until the loop? Actually, the first token is exactly `ans1`. The rest of the output is generated by the loop. So we can avoid building the entire string for the purpose of the third program.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply use:\n\n        s = integer_to_string(ans1)\n\n   and then check if s contains 'A' and 'B'. \n\n   However, this deviates from the original chain? What if the second program had side effects? It doesn't. It only prints.\n\n   But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is:\n\n        The first program outputs an integer (say x).\n        The second program reads x and then prints x, then a sequence of divisors (each on a new line) until 1.\n        The third program reads the first token (which is x as a string) and checks for 'A' and 'B'.\n\n   So we don't need the entire output of the second program for the chain. We only need the first token.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip generating the entire output of the second program? We only need to know the first token (which is the same as the integer we passed in).\n\n   However, the problem says: \"translate the entire sequence\". We must translate each program. But note that the second program's output beyond the first token is not used. So we can avoid generating it? \n\n   But wait: the problem does not say we can skip parts of the programs. We must translate the entire sequence. Therefore, we must simulate the second program exactly? \n\n   However, the second program's output beyond the first token is irrelevant because the third program doesn't read it. So in terms of observable behavior, only the first token matters. But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The second program does run and produce the entire output. But the third program only reads the first token.\n\n   Since we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle, we don't have to worry about the entire output being printed. We only have to produce the final output. And the final output is \"No\", and that is determined by the first token.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial input and compute ans1.\n\n        Step 2: Convert ans1 to a string (call it s1).\n\n        Step 3: Check if s1 contains both 'A' and 'B'. (It won't, so the result is \"No\").\n\n        Then output \"No\".\n\n   But wait: what if the second program had a bug that crashed on certain inputs? We must run the second program? \n\n   The problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must run the second program? Actually, the second program does not crash for any integer? It runs a loop from n-1 down to 1. It only uses modulus. It should be safe.\n\n   However, note: the second program does not produce any side effect (other than printing). Since we are not printing in the intermediate steps, we can skip the generation of the entire output? But the problem says: \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we are allowed to compute the entire output of the second program as a string without printing it? But if we do, we are doing extra work that is not used. \n\n   Since the problem does not require us to print the intermediate results, we can avoid building the entire string? We are only required to produce the same final output.\n\n   However, to be safe and follow the requirement to \"translate the entire sequence\", we should compute the entire output of the second program (as a string) and then pass that entire string to the third program. But the third program only reads the first token. So we can extract the first token from the entire output? \n\n   How the third program works: it reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). The first token in the entire output of the second program is the string representation of `ans1`.\n\n   Therefore, we can build the entire output string of the second program, then split it to get the first token? But note: the output of the second program has newlines and spaces. The tokens are separated by any whitespace. The first token is the first word (which is the integer `ans1`).\n\n   So we can:\n\n        Step 3: Build a string `s2` that is the entire output of the second program (with newlines and spaces). Then we extract the first token from `s2` (by scanning until we hit a whitespace, but note: the first token is the entire contiguous non-whitespace sequence at the beginning).\n\n        However, the first token is just the string representation of `ans1` without any leading whitespace. The second program prints `n + \" \"` (with a space) and then a newline. So the first token is the entire first number.\n\n        Actually, the first line is: `ans1` and then a space and then a newline. But the token will be the string of `ans1` without the trailing space? The `next()` method in Java will take the entire sequence of non-whitespace characters until the first whitespace. So the first token is the string of `ans1`.\n\n        Therefore, we can extract the first token by simply taking the integer `ans1` and converting it to a string? \n\n        But what if the integer is negative? The original first program outputs a positive integer (since it's an index starting at 1). So we are safe.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that the entire output of the second program is not needed beyond the first token, and that the first token is exactly the string representation of `ans1`, we can avoid building the entire string? \n\n   However, to be faithful to the original chain, we must run the second program's logic? The second program does not just output the first token and stop. It runs a loop. But the loop does not affect the first token. \n\n   Therefore, I propose:\n\n        We compute ans1 from the first program.\n\n        Then we run the second program's logic (without printing) and build the entire output string? But we don't have to: because the third program only uses the first token. \n\n        But the problem says: \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". It doesn't say we must compute the entire output. It says we must process without I/O. We are allowed to compute as much as we want? \n\n        However, the problem says \"translate the entire sequence\". So we must include the logic of the second program? \n\n        We can run the second program's loop and build the entire output string? Then we extract the first token? \n\n        But note: the entire output string might be long? The second program runs from n-1 down to 1, and we only do something when it's a divisor. The number of divisors is not huge. So we can build the entire string.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the quadruples -> compute ans1.\n\n        Step 2: \n            m = ans1\n            We start building a string: \n                token = integer_to_string(m)  -> then we append a space and then a newline? (because the second program uses println for the first number: `System.out.println(n + \" \");` -> this actually prints the number and then a space and then a newline? \n                Then for i from m-1 down to 1:\n                    if m % i == 0 then \n                         token = integer_to_string(i)   -> and then we append a space and a newline? and then set m = i.\n\n            But note: the second program does:\n                System.out.println(n + \" \");   -> This is: (n as string) + \" \" and then a newline.\n\n                Then in the loop: \n                    System.out.println(i + \" \"); -> (i as string) + \" \" and then a newline.\n\n            So we build a string that has: \n                str = trim(adjustl(int_to_str(ans1))) // \" \" // new_line('a')   [But note: we don't have to exactly use new_line? We can use a character array and append newline characters?]\n\n            Then for each divisor i we find, we append: trim(adjustl(int_to_str(i))) // \" \" // new_line('a')\n\n        Step 3: Then we extract the first token from this entire string. How? We can traverse the string until we find a whitespace (space, tab, newline) and take the substring from the beginning to the first whitespace? But note: the first token is the first integer. We can also note that the first token is just the string representation of ans1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire string and just use the string representation of ans1 for the third program? \n\n        But to be safe and follow the requirement, let's build the entire output of the second program and then extract the first token. \n\n        How to extract the first token? We can:\n\n            Find the first whitespace in the entire string. Then the first token is the substring from the beginning to the first whitespace.\n\n        However, note: the first part of the string we built is the integer (without any leading spaces) and then a space. So the first token is the entire integer string.\n\n        We can simply use the string we built for the first integer? Actually, we built the entire output of the second program. Then we can parse the first token? \n\n        But we already have the integer ans1. We can convert it to a string and that is the first token? \n\n        I think we can do:\n\n            token = trim(adjustl(int_to_str(ans1)))   -> but note: the second program does not trim? It prints the integer as is. So if the integer is 10, the string is \"10\" (without any extra spaces at the beginning? because we are using adjustl and trim?).\n\n        However, the second program prints the integer and then a space. So the token is \"10\", because the space terminates the token.\n\n        Therefore, the first token is exactly the string representation of ans1.\n\n        So we can avoid building the entire string? \n\n        But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. The second program is part of the sequence. We must run its logic? \n\n        We must run the loop because the problem says \"entire sequence\". But the loop does not affect the first token. \n\n        However, the second program's logic might not run if the integer is 0 or negative? The original program: \n            int n = sc.nextInt();\n            ... then for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--)\n\n            If n is 1, then the loop condition fails (i>0 -> i=0, so skip). \n\n            If n is 0, then i = -1 -> and then the loop condition fails? \n\n        But the first program: the answer `ans` is an index (starting at 1) and the price is at least 500? So it's positive. \n\n        Therefore, we can run the loop to be faithful? But note: the problem says \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we are allowed to run the loop and build the entire output string without printing it? \n\n        We will build the entire output string of the second program as a single string (with newlines) and then extract the first token for the third program.\n\n   Step 4: Check the first token (which is the string representation of ans1) for containing 'A' and 'B'. Since it's a string of digits, it will not contain either. So output \"No\".\n\n   Step 5: Print \"No\".\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We'll need:\n      - A function to convert integer to string (we can write one, or use internal write).\n\n   Since Fortran does not have built-in string handling like Java, we have to do:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: str2   ! for the entire output of the second program\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: token  ! for the first token\n\n        But we don't need the entire string for the third program? Only the first token.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire string for the second program? We only need the first token. And the first token is the string of ans1. So we can skip building the entire string? \n\n        However, to be faithful, we build the entire string and then extract the first token? \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire string to be built if we can avoid it? It only requires the same behavior.\n\n        Since the third program only uses the first token, we can simply use the string of ans1.\n\n   I think we can do without building the entire string. But to follow the requirement of translating the entire sequence, we should run the loop of the second program? \n\n   We can run the loop and build the entire string? The maximum value of ans1 might be large? But the original first program has n up to 100, and the quadruples: \n        vec[i][3] (the price) is at least 500? and we choose the one with the smallest price. \n\n        The price is an integer, and the answer is the index (so at most 100). \n\n        Therefore, ans1 is at most 100. Then the second program will run from 99 down to 1? and the divisors of 100? But actually, we start with ans1 (which is at most 100) and then we update m to the divisors. The divisors of 100: 100, 50, 25, 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1? But the program does:\n\n            m = ans1\n            for i from m-1 down to 1:\n                if m % i == 0, then print i and set m = i.\n\n        So it doesn't necessarily get all divisors? It gets the next divisor that is one less than the current m? \n\n        Example: \n            Start: m=10\n            i=9 -> 10 % 9 !=0 -> skip\n            i=8 -> 10%8 !=0 -> skip\n            i=7 -> skip\n            i=6 -> skip\n            i=5 -> 10%5==0 -> then set m=5, then next i from 4 down to 1: \n                i=4: 5%4 !=0\n                i=3: skip\n                i=2: skip\n                i=1: 5%1==0 -> then set m=1, then the loop ends? because then i becomes 0? \n\n        So the output for 10 is:\n            10 \n            5 \n            1 \n\n        The divisors found are 5 and 1.\n\n        The number of divisors we output is at most the number of prime factors? Actually, it's the chain of divisors we find by decreasing the denominator. The total number of divisors we output is O(log n). So the entire string is not too long.\n\n   Therefore, we can build the entire string.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then n quadruples (4 integers per line).\n\n        Step 2: Run the first program's logic to compute `ans1` (an integer).\n\n        Step 3: \n            m = ans1\n            str2 = ''   ! we'll build the entire output string of the second program.\n\n            First, convert `m` to a string and append a space and a newline.\n            Then, for i = m-1 down to 1:\n                if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                    convert `i` to a string, append a space and a newline to it, and then append that to `str2`.\n                    set m = i   (so that we continue with the new m)\n\n            Now, we have the entire output string `str2`.\n\n        Step 4: Extract the first token from `str2`. How?\n\n            The first token is the first sequence of non-whitespace characters. We can:\n\n                skip leading whitespace (if any) -> but the first character should be non-whitespace.\n\n                then take until the next whitespace.\n\n            But note: the first part we built: the integer `ans1` (without any leading space) and then a space. So the first token is the entire integer string.\n\n            We can also note: we built the first part as: \n                s = integer_to_string(ans1) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n            The new_line is a non-printable? Actually, we used a character for newline. We can represent newline as char(10). \n\n            How about we break the string `str2` at the first whitespace? But note: the first token ends at the first space? \n\n            Actually, the first token is the integer string. Then we have a space. Then we have a newline? Then the next token would be the next integer? \n\n            The first token is the integer string without any trailing space. We can get the length of the integer string by using the conversion function? \n\n            Alternatively, we can build the first token separately: we know the first token is the integer `ans1` converted to a string. So we can just convert `ans1` to a string again and use that? \n\n            But to be consistent with the entire output string, we should extract from `str2`.\n\n            We can:\n\n                idx = 1\n                token = ''\n                do while (idx <= len(str2) .and. str2(idx:idx) /= ' ' .and. str2(idx:idx) /= char(10) .and. str2(idx:idx) /= char(9))\n                    token = token // str2(idx:idx)\n                    idx = idx + 1\n                end do\n\n            But note: the integer might be negative? But in our case, it's positive.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the intrinsic `index` function to find the first space or newline? \n\n            Since we built the string, we know the first token is the first integer. We can simply use:\n\n                pos = index(str2, ' ')   ! find the first space\n                if (pos > 0) then\n                    token = str2(1:pos-1)\n                else\n                    ! if there's no space? then the entire string is the token? \n                    token = str2\n                end if\n\n            But note: we appended a space right after the integer. So the first space is at the end of the integer string.\n\n            So token = str2(1:index(str2,' ')-1)\n\n        Step 5: Check token for containing 'A' and 'B'. \n\n            if (index(token, 'A') > 0 .and. index(token, 'B') > 0) then\n                output = 'Yes'\n            else\n                output = 'No'\n            end if\n\n        Step 6: Print output.\n\n   However, note: the token is a string of digits. It will never contain 'A' or 'B'. So we can skip the check? But we must do it for correctness.\n\n   But what if the integer was 65? The token is \"65\". It does not contain 'A'. So we output \"No\".\n\n   Therefore, the entire program:\n\n        Read n\n        Allocate an array for n quadruples (4 integers per row)\n\n        Read the quadruples.\n\n        ans1 = ... (from the first program)\n\n        Then run the second program: build the entire output string for the second program (with newlines).\n\n        Extract the first token from that string.\n\n        Check the token for containing 'A' and 'B' -> always false -> output \"No\"\n\n   But note: the first program might output an integer that is 65? \n\n        The first program: \n            It reads n (number of laptops) and then for each laptop: speed, ram, hdd, price.\n\n            Then it finds a laptop that is not outdated (i.e., there is no other laptop that has higher speed, ram, and hdd). Then among these, it picks the one with the smallest price. The answer is the index (starting at 1).\n\n            So the index is between 1 and n (n<=100). So the integer is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the token is a string of at most 3 digits (if n=100, then 100). \n\n        So the token will never contain a letter.\n\n   Therefore, the output is always \"No\".\n\n   But we must code the entire chain.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We need helper functions to convert integers to strings? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        subroutine int_to_string(i, s)\n            integer, intent(in) :: i\n            character(len=*), intent(out) :: s\n            write(s, '(I0)') i\n        end subroutine\n\n   But we don't know the length? We can use internal files.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a function that returns a string.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        function int2str(i) result(s)\n            integer, intent(in) :: i\n            character(len=32) :: buf   ! big enough for integers\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n            write(buf, *) i\n            s = trim(adjustl(buf))\n        end function\n\n   But note: the integer is positive and at most 100, so we can use:\n\n        write(buf, '(I10)') i   -> then adjustl and trim.\n\n   However, Fortran 95 doesn't have allocatable strings? We are writing in fixed-form? Actually, we can use Fortran 2003 features? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   We'll assume we can use Fortran 2003.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid allocatable strings by pre-defining fixed-length strings? \n\n   The entire output of the second program: the integers are at most 100, and the divisors chain: the maximum length of the chain is about 100? Then the entire string length is about (3+2)*100 = 500? (each integer: 3 digits, then a space and a newline -> 3+2=5 per line, and 100 lines -> 500). So we can use a character(len=500) for the entire string.\n\n   Similarly, the token: at most 3 characters.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then n quadruples (using a 2D array: n rows, 4 columns).\n\n        Step 2: \n            ans1 = 0\n            ansprice = 20000   (a big number)\n            do i=1, n\n                fl = 1   ! true\n                do j=1, n\n                    if (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) .and. vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) .and. vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) then\n                        fl = 0\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (fl == 1) then\n                    if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n                        ansprice = vec(i,4)\n                        ans1 = i\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n            Note: the original program sets `ans = i+1`? Actually, it sets `ans = i+1`? \n\n            In the original:\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) ... \n                if condition met, then ans = i+1.\n\n            So we set ans1 = i   (in the loop) but then we are storing the index i (which is 1-indexed in Fortran). \n\n            Actually, in Fortran, our loop i is from 1 to n. Then ans1 = i. But the original Java: i is 0-indexed, so they store i+1. \n\n            Therefore, in our code, we are storing the 1-indexed index? \n\n            But note: the original Java program outputs the 1-indexed index (i+1). \n\n            So we don't need to add 1? Because our i is 1-indexed. \n\n            Actually, in the original: \n                for (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    if (condition) then set ans = i+1.\n                }\n\n            In Fortran, we are iterating i=1 to n. If condition met, set ans1 = i.\n\n            Then the value we have is the same as the original: the 1-indexed index.\n\n            So we are good.\n\n        Step 3: Now, we run the second program on ans1.\n\n            m = ans1\n            str2 = ''   ! we'll build the entire output string.\n\n            First, convert m to string -> s_temp\n            Then: \n                str2 = trim(s_temp) // ' ' // new_line('a')   ! because the first line: n + \" \" and then newline.\n\n            Then, do i = m-1, 1, -1\n                if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                    convert i to string -> s_temp\n                    str2 = trim(str2) // trim(s_temp) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n                    m = i\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            Now, we have the entire output of the second program in str2.\n\n        Step 4: Extract the first token from str2.\n\n            We can find the first space or newline? But note: the first token is the integer string and then we put a space. So the token is the part until the first space.\n\n            Let pos = index(str2, ' ')\n            if (pos == 0) then\n                token = str2   ! but we always put a space, so this should not happen?\n            else\n                token = str2(1:pos-1)\n            end if\n\n        Step 5: Check if token contains 'A' and 'B'\n\n            if (index(token, 'A') > 0 .and. index(token, 'B') > 0) then\n                write(*,*) 'Yes'\n            else\n                write(*,*) 'No'\n            end if\n\n   However, note: the original third program outputs without quotes? And without extra spaces? \n\n        In Java: out.println(\"Yes\"); -> prints \"Yes\" and then a newline.\n\n        In Fortran: we do write(*,*) 'Yes' -> this might add extra spaces? \n\n        We can use: \n            write(*,'(A)') 'Yes'\n\n        to avoid extra spaces.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the entire program must read from standard input and write to standard output.\n\n   We assume the input is provided as the first program expects: \n        first integer n, then n lines of 4 integers.\n\n   We'll write the program in free form.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n            integer :: n, i, j, fl, ans1, ansprice, m, k, ios\n            integer, allocatable :: vec(:,:)   !

But it's safe to break?\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (fl == 1) then\n                    if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n                        ansprice = vec(i,4)\n                        ans1 = i   ! because i is 1-indexed, same as the original i+1 (since original i started at 0)\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 3: second program logic to build the entire output string\n            str2 = ''   ! initialize\n            m = ans1\n\n            ! Convert m to string\n            write(temp_str, '(I0)') m\n            ! Remove any leading spaces? adjustl and trim\n            temp_str = adjustl(temp_str)\n            str2 = trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n            ! Now, loop from m-1 down to 1\n            do i = m-1, 1, -1\n                if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                    write(temp_str, '(I0)') i\n                    temp_str = adjustl(temp_str)\n                    str2 = trim(str2) // trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n                    m = i\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 4: extract first token from str2\n            pos = index(str2, ' ')\n            if (pos > 0) then\n                token = str2(1:pos-1)\n            else\n                token = str2\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 5: third program logic\n            if (index(token, 'A') > 0 .and. index(token, 'B') > 0) then\n                write(*,'(A)') 'Yes'\n            else\n                write(*,'(A)') 'No'\n            end if\n\n            deallocate(vec)\n        end program\n\n   However, note: the second program in Java does:\n\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        But note: we update m to i only when we find a divisor. Then we continue the loop with the same i? Actually, the loop variable i continues to decrease. \n\n        Example: \n            Start: n=10 -> m=10\n            i=9 -> 10 mod 9 !=0 -> skip\n            i=8 -> skip\n            ... until i=5: 10 mod 5==0 -> then set m=5, then the next i is 4 (because i decreases to 4, then 3, then 2, then 1). Then for m=5, we check i from 4 down to 1: \n                i=4: 5 mod 4 !=0\n                i=3: no\n                i=2: no\n                i=1: 5 mod 1==0 -> then print 1 and set m=1.\n\n        So we must update m to i, and then continue the loop with the next i (which is i-1). \n\n        We are doing that.\n\n   But note: the string building: we are appending the divisor and then a space and a newline. The original second program uses println, so that's correct.\n\n   However, the original second program prints the initial n and a space (without a newline? actually, println does newline). Then in the loop, each divisor is printed with a space and then a newline.\n\n   We are building the entire output string with the same format.\n\n   Therefore, the program should be correct.\n\n   But note: the variable `str2` is fixed length (500). We are using `trim(str2)` when appending. But then we assign to `str2` which is fixed length? We are overwriting the entire string. We are using:\n\n        str2 = trim(str2) // ... \n\n   This might truncate if the total length exceeds 500? But we said 500 is enough.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a loop to build the string without trimming? We can keep an integer for the current length.\n\n   However, for simplicity, and since the maximum length is 500, we assume 500 is enough.\n\n   Let me test with the maximum: \n        ans1 = 100 -> then the divisors: 100, 50, 25, 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1 -> 8 numbers? \n        Each number: \n            100 -> 3 chars\n            50 -> 2\n            25 -> 2\n            20 -> 2\n            10 -> 2\n            5 -> 1\n            4 -> 1\n            2 -> 1\n            1 -> 1\n        Then for each number: we append the number and then a space and a newline -> so each line: (number of digits) + 2 (for space and newline) \n        Actually, newline is one character? In Fortran, new_line('a') returns a character of kind similar to 'a' that is the newline. So it is one character.\n\n        Then total length: \n            100: 3 + 2 = 5\n            50: 2+2=4\n            ... until 1: 1+2=3\n            total = 5+4+4+4+4+3+3+3 = 30? \n\n        So 500 is plenty.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   But note: the token extraction: we are using a fixed-length string for token? We defined token as character(len=500). But the token is at most 3 characters. So we can use:\n\n        character(len=10) :: token   ! 10 is enough for integers up to 100.\n\n   Similarly, we can use a fixed-length buffer for temp_str.\n\n   Let me revise:\n\n        We'll use:\n            character(len=500) :: str2   ! for the entire output of the second program\n            character(len=10) :: token   ! for the first token\n\n        And for converting integers, we can use a fixed buffer:\n\n            character(len=10) :: temp_str   ! for each integer\n\n   Then:\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I10)') m   ! I10 is enough for integers up to 10^10, but we have at most 100 -> so 3 digits.\n        temp_str = adjustl(temp_str)   ! left adjusted\n\n   Then when we do:\n\n        str2 = trim(str2) // trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n   But note: the length of str2 is fixed at 500. We are assigning a new value. The new value must not exceed 500.\n\n   How to build without fixed-length? We can use allocatable character and then reallocate? But that is more complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a loop and track the current length? \n\n   Since the maximum length is small (about 30), we can do:\n\n        str2 = ''   ! initialize to empty\n\n        Then for each part we want to append:\n\n            part = trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n            new_str = trim(str2) // part   ! but new_str must be stored in a variable that can grow? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            str2 = trim(str2) // trim(temp_str) // ' ' // new_line('a')\n\n        and hope that the fixed-length 500 is enough.\n\n   We'll use fixed-length for simplicity.\n\n   Finally, the program.\n\n   Note: we are using new_line('a') to get the newline character. This is standard.\n\n   Let me write the complete program.\n\n   We'll use free-form Fortran.\n\n   Note: The original first program outputs the integer `ans` (the index) and then exits. Then the second program takes that integer as input. We are passing `ans1` (which is the index) to the second program.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   Code:\n\n      [See below]"
