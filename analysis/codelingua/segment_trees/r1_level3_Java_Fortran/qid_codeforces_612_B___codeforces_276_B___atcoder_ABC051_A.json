But the internal write might have padded with spaces? We used '(I0)' so no leading spaces. But the string might have trailing spaces? Actually, we wrote to a fixed-length character variable (len=20). So we have to consider only the non-space part? Or we can trim? Actually, we should traverse the entire string and break when we hit a space? Or we can use the trimmed length. How to get the actual length? We can use:\n\n        len_trim(str1)\n\n    Then:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        integer :: freq(0:9)   ! we'll index by the integer value of the digit? Or we can use the character representation. Actually, we can use:\n\n            integer :: counts(0:255)   ! for each ASCII character\n\n        But we only care about digits? The string is composed of digits. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            integer :: i, j, len1, ch\n            len1 = len_trim(str1) do i = 1, len1\n                ch = ichar(str1(i:i))\n                ! then increment counts for that ASCII code? But we don't know the range. Or we can use:\n\n            integer :: char_to_index\n            character :: c\n\n            We can do:\n\n                integer :: freq_counts(48:57) = 0   ! '0' is 48, '9' is 57. Then:\n\n                do i = 1, len1\n                    c = str1(i:i)\n                    freq_counts(ichar(c)) = freq_counts(ichar(c)) + 1\n                end do\n\n            Then we traverse the keys? Actually, we only need to check the digits. Alternatively, we can use an array of size 0:9 and map the character to the digit:\n\n            do i = 1, len1\n                read(str1(i:i), '(I1)') digit   ! but that is inefficient\n            or\n                digit = ichar(str1(i:i)) - 48\n                freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n\n            Then we don't need the full ASCII. Let's do:\n\n            integer :: freq(0:9) = 0\n            integer :: digit, len1, i\n            character :: c\n\n            len1 = len_trim(str1) do i = 1, len1\n                c = str1(i:i) if (c >= '0' .and. c <= '9') then\n                    digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n                    freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then we count the number of digits that have odd frequency? Actually, we are counting the frequency of each digit in the string. Then:\n\n            oddCount = 0\n            do i = 0, 9\n                if (mod(freq(i), 2) /= 0) then\n                    oddCount = oddCount + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n  5. Then we decide:\n\n        if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n            result_str = \"First\"\n        else\n            result_str = \"Second\"\n        end if\n\n  6. Then the third program: we have the string `result_str`. We must replace every comma by a space. But there are no commas. So we can simply:\n\n        output_str = result_str   ! and then we output output_str\n\n        However, we do:\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(result_str) if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = ' '\n                else\n                    output_str(i:i) = result_str(i:i)\n                end if\n            end do But since there is no comma, we can skip? But for correctness, we do it. Actually, we can do:\n\n            output_str = result_str do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n                if (output_str(i:i) == ',') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = ' '\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        But note: the string \"First\" and \"Second\" do not have commas. 7. Then we write the output:\n\n        write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)   !",

But we are storing positions for x in the input (which are from 1 to n). Then when we do the loop for i=2 to n, we are accessing positions(1) to positions(n). So we are safe. However, what if n=0? Then the loop for reading the integers is skipped. Then the loop for the sum is from 2 to 0 -> no iterations. Then ans=0. Then we process the string \"0\". Then we output \"First\" because for the string \"0\": \n      freq(0)=1 -> oddCount=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true -> \"First\"\n\n  But the original first program for n=0? It would read n=0, then try to read 0 integers. Then the array dp is not set, but the loop for the sum is from 2 to 0? Actually, the loop: for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) ... when n=0, the loop runs from 2 to 0 -> no iterations. Then ans=0. Then output 0. Then the second program reads \"0\", and then outputs \"First\". Then the third program outputs \"First\". So it's consistent. Therefore, we are done. Let me test with a small example. Example for the first program:\n\n      n=3\n      integers: 3 1 2\n\n      Then:\n          positions(3) = 1\n          positions(1) = 2\n          positions(2) = 3\n\n      Then the differences:\n          |positions(2)-positions(1)| = |?| -> positions(1)=2, positions(2)=3 -> |2-3| = 1\n          |positions(3)-positions(2)| = |?| -> positions(3)=1, positions(2)=3 -> |1-3| = 2\n          ans = 1+2 = 3\n\n      Then the string is \"3\"\n\n      Second program: \n          frequency: \n             '3' -> 1 (odd)\n          oddCount=1 -> output \"First\"\n\n      Third program: replaces commas (none) -> outputs \"First\"\n\n  So the final output is \"First\". In Fortran, we output \"First\". Therefore, the code is as below. Note: I used `integer(kind=8)` for `ans`. Alternatively, we can use `integer(8)` or `integer*8` but the standard way is `integer(kind=8)` or using `selected_int_kind`. But for simplicity, we use `integer(kind=8)`. However, to be more standard, we can use:\n\n      integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n      integer(kind=int64) :: ans\n\n  But since the problem does not specify the Fortran version, we use the simpler `integer(kind=8)`. Let me write the code accordingly. One more note: the array `freq` for digits: we defined as `freq(0:9)`. But we must initialize to 0. We did:\n\n        freq = 0\n\n  This is a valid Fortran 90 initialization. Therefore, the final code:",

Actually, in Fortran, if we declare `positions(200000)`, then the indices run from 1 to 200000. How about if x=200000? Then we set positions(200000)=i. But if n=200000, then x can be 200000. But if n>200000? The problem states n, and the array is 200001 in Java. So we assume n<=200000. Actually, the problem does not specify n, but the array is 200001, so n<=200000. Therefore, we are safe. However, we must note: the loop for the sum goes from i=2 to n. We are using `positions(i)` and `positions(i-1)`.",

Because it's a permutation. So we have stored the positions for 1,2,...,n. This is correct. But what if the input integers are not a permutation? The problem says it is. Now, we must compile with 64-bit integers for `ans`. We can use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n        integer(kind=int64) :: ans\n\n  But for simplicity, we can use `integer*8` if the compiler allows. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n  Let me write the entire program accordingly. One more issue: the array `positions` must be initialized? In Java, the array is initialized to 0.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nSteps:\n1. The first program (codeforces_612_B) reads an integer `n`, then `n` integers. It stores the index (0-indexed) of each integer in an array `dp` at the position of the integer. Then it computes the sum of absolute differences between the positions of consecutive integers from 1 to n (i.e., |dp[2]-dp[1]| + |dp[3]-dp[2]| + ... + |dp[n]-dp[n-1]|) and prints the sum.\n\n2. The second program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string. It counts the frequency of each character. Then it counts the number of characters that have an odd frequency. If the count of odd frequencies is 0 or 1 or an odd number, it prints \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\n3. The third program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces every comma with a space.\n\nWe are to chain these programs: the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\nHowever, note the outputs and inputs:\n  - First program outputs a single integer (the sum) as a string (with newline).\n  - Second program expects a string (without any prior integer, but the first program only outputs one integer). The second program reads one line.\n\nBut the second program expects a string of characters, but the first program outputs an integer. How to reconcile?\n\nWe must note: the entire output of the first program (which is a string representation of a long integer and a newline) becomes the input to the second program. The second program then processes that string.\n\nSimilarly, the output of the second program (either \"First\" or \"Second\" with a newline) becomes the input to the third program.\n\nBut the third program replaces commas with spaces. Since the output of the second program does not contain any commas, it will remain unchanged? However, we must note that the third program also outputs the string. So the final output would be the same as the second program's output but with commas replaced by spaces? But there are no commas.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". So we must chain the programs as is.\n\nBut note: the first program reads multiple integers. The input format for the first program is:\n  n\n  a1 a2 ... an\n\nBut the second program reads a single string (one line). The third program also reads a single string (one line).\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input for the entire system: the input for the first program (an integer n and then n integers in one line? Actually, the first program uses a Scanner that reads tokens. It reads the integer n, then n integers (each read by nextInt). The input integers could be in the same line or multiple lines.\n\nHowever, the second program reads a whole line. So the output of the first program (which is one integer and a newline) becomes the single line for the second program.\n\nBut the second program will read that integer string (e.g., \"12345\") as the string? Then it will count the frequency of each digit? And then output either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nThen the third program will take that string (either \"First\" or \"Second\") and replace commas (if any) with spaces (there are none) and then output.\n\nSo the entire system:\n  Input: first the integer n and then n integers (as in the first program).\n  Output: the string \"First\" or \"Second\" but without any commas (so same) and then the third program outputs that string.\n\nBut wait: the third program outputs the same string? Then why the chain?\n\nActually, the chain might not be logically consistent? But we are to chain the programs as they are.\n\nPlan for Fortran:\n\nWe have to combine the three programs without intermediate I/O.\n\nSteps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program: an integer n and then n integers (we can read from standard input).\n\n2. Process the first program: store the positions (index) of the integers in an array. Then compute the sum of absolute differences of positions for consecutive integers.\n\n   Note: In the first program, the array `dp` is of size 200001. We can do the same in Fortran.\n\n3. Instead of printing the sum, we pass it as a string to the second program.\n\n   But the second program expects a string (which is the entire output of the first program). So we convert the sum to a string.\n\n4. The second program: take the string (which is the string representation of the sum) and count the frequency of each character. Then count the number of characters that have odd frequency.\n\n5. Then decide: if oddCount <= 1 or oddCount is odd -> output \"First\", else \"Second\". But note: the condition in the Java code is:\n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n   which means: if oddCount is 0,1, or any odd number (like 3,5,...) then \"First\", otherwise (if oddCount is even and >=2) then \"Second\".\n\n6. Then the third program: take the string (which is either \"First\" or \"Second\") and replace every comma with a space. But there are no commas, so the string remains the same.\n\n7. Then output the string (without any extra I/O in the middle).\n\nBut note: the entire Fortran program should read the input for the first program and then output the result of the third program.\n\nHowever, the second program in the chain does not use the original input (the integers) but uses the output of the first program (a single integer string). Similarly, the third program uses the output of the second.\n\nSo we must simulate:\n\n  Step1: Read n and the n integers.\n  Step2: Compute the sum (as in the first program) and convert that sum to a string (without newline? but note the second program reads a whole line). Actually, the second program reads one line. So we have a string that is the integer without any extra spaces? Actually, the first program outputs the integer and then a newline. But the second program uses `readLine()` which reads the entire line (including the newline? but the BufferedReader.readLine() does not include the newline). So we have to form a string that is the integer without the newline? Actually, in the chain, the second program receives the integer as a string without the trailing newline? Because readLine() strips the newline.\n\n  However, in our Fortran chain, we are not actually doing I/O. So we can just form the string of the integer and then pass it to the second step.\n\n  Similarly, the third step gets the string from the second step (which is either \"First\" or \"Second\") without a newline? Actually, the second program prints the string and then flushes. But then the third program reads a line? So it would read the string without the newline? Then the third program outputs the same string (with commas replaced by spaces) and then a newline.\n\n  But note: the third program uses `System.out.println(sb)` which appends a newline.\n\n  So the entire chain: the output of the first program is a string of the integer and a newline. Then the second program reads that newline? Actually, the BufferedReader.readLine() reads until the newline and discards it. So the string in the second program is the integer without the newline.\n\n  Similarly, the output of the second program is a string (either \"First\" or \"Second\") and then a newline. The third program reads that entire line (without the newline) and then outputs the same string (with commas replaced by spaces) and a newline.\n\n  But note: the third program does not see the newline from the second program? Because the second program flushes and then the third program reads from the same standard input? But in reality, they are separate programs. However, in our combined Fortran, we are simulating the chain without I/O.\n\n  How to simulate:\n\n    Step1: Read n and the n integers (from standard input).\n    Step2: Compute the sum (call it `ans1`). Convert `ans1` to a string (without any newline) and use that string as the input for the second program.\n\n    Step3: For the second program, process the string (which is the string of `ans1`). Count frequency of each character. Then compute oddCount. Then set a string variable to either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n    Step4: For the third program, take the string from step3 and replace every comma (if any) by a space. Since there are none, it remains the same.\n\n    Step5: Output the string (with a newline? because the third program does a println).\n\nBut note: the original third program does a println. So we output the string and then a newline.\n\nHowever, the second program in the original chain outputs a newline. But in the chain, the third program reads the entire line (which is the word without the newline). Then it prints that word (without commas) and then a newline.\n\nSo in the combined program, we must output the word and then a newline.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain outputs a newline. However, the third program does not see the newline? Because the readLine() removes it. So the string that the third program processes is without the newline. Therefore, we don't have to worry about the newline in the string for the third program.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n  We will read the initial data (n and the n integers).\n\n  Then we compute the sum for the first program.\n\n  Then we convert the sum to a string (without any newline) and then use that string as the input for the second program.\n\n  Then we process the second program: count frequencies of each character in that string.\n\n  Then we decide the result string (either \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\n  Then we process the third program: replace commas in that result string by spaces (but there are none) and then output the string.\n\n  We output the result string (with a newline).\n\nHowever, note: the first program might output a negative number? But the problem states that n>=1, and the positions are nonnegative. The sum is nonnegative? Actually, the absolute differences are nonnegative. So the sum is nonnegative.\n\nBut what if the sum is 0? Then the string is \"0\".\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We need to read:\n      integer :: n\n      integer, dimension(200001) :: dp   ! but we only use indices from 1 to n? Actually, the integers read are in the range [1, n]? The problem says: the input is a permutation of 1..n? Actually, the first program: it reads n integers and stores the index for the integer value. So the integers are distinct and in the range [1, n]? Actually, the problem does not say, but the array `dp` is of size 200001, so we can assume the integers are in [1,200000]. But the problem says n, so we only use indices 1..n? Actually, the first program uses the integers as indices? So the integers are positive and at most 200000.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read n.\n  2. Allocate or use an array dp(1:200000) (but we can set the size to 200001 to be safe). Actually, the Java code: `int dp[] = new int[200001];` so we make dp(1:200000) or dp(0:200000)? In Java, the array is 0-indexed and goes from 0 to 200000. But the integers we read are stored at the index of the integer. So for an integer x, we set dp[x] = i (where i is 0-indexed). But in Fortran, we can use 1-indexing? Or we can use 0-indexing? It doesn't matter as long as we are consistent.\n\n  However, note: the integers we read are positive and at least 1. So we can use an array starting at index 1.\n\n  But the problem: the integers can be up to 200000? So we need an array of size at least 200000.\n\n  Let me define: integer, dimension(200000) :: positions   ! we'll call it positions, and we index from 1 to 200000.\n\n  Then for i from 1 to n, we read an integer x, and set positions(x) = i-1   (because in Java the index is 0-indexed). But actually, the absolute differences are the same regardless of the indexing? Because we are subtracting indices. However, we must note: the Java program uses 0-indexed positions. But the absolute difference is the same as if we used 1-indexed? No, because the positions are relative. But the problem does not specify the meaning of the positions. Actually, the positions are the order of the integers in the input. So we must store the index as given (0-indexed in Java, but in Fortran we can store the same 0-indexed? Or we can store 1-indexed? The difference: |a-b| is the same regardless.\n\n  Actually, we are storing the index (the order of appearance). The first number is at index0 (Java) and we store it at positions(x)=0. Then the next at positions(x)=1, etc.\n\n  In Fortran, we can store the index as 0-indexed? Or we can store 1-indexed? It doesn't matter because the absolute difference between two indices is the same. However, to be consistent, we can store the index starting at 0? But Fortran arrays: we can store the positions in an array and then compute the absolute differences.\n\n  Alternatively, we can store the positions as 1-indexed? Then we read the first integer and store at positions(x)=1, then second at 2, etc. Then the absolute difference between positions(2) and positions(1) is the same as in the Java program? Actually, no: because in Java the first index is 0, and we store 0. Then the difference |0-1| is 1. But in Fortran if we store 1 and 2 then |1-2| is also 1. So the differences are the same? Actually, the differences would be the same? Because the indices are consecutive integers. The absolute difference between two consecutive indices (if we store 1-indexed) would be the same as in 0-indexed? Because the difference is 1 in both cases? Actually, no: the positions are arbitrary. The first integer is at position0 in Java, but if we store position1 in Fortran, then the absolute difference between two consecutive numbers (say a and b) would be |pos1 - pos2| in both cases. The value of the positions are different? But the relative differences are the same? Actually, the positions are stored as integers and we are subtracting. So if we use 1-indexed in Fortran, then we are storing the index i (from 1 to n) and then the difference |i - j| is the same as |(i-1) - (j-1)|? Yes, because |i-1 - j+1|? Actually, no: | (i-1) - (j-1) | = |i-j|. So it is the same.\n\n  Therefore, we can store the positions as 1-indexed in Fortran. Then we read the integers and for the i-th integer (i from 1 to n) we store positions(x) = i.\n\n  Then the absolute difference between positions(i) and positions(i-1) is |positions(i) - positions(i-1)|. And the sum is the same.\n\n  Alternatively, we can store 0-indexed? But Fortran arrays: we can have an array starting at 1. We don't need to use 0-indexing.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    integer :: n, i, x\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: positions   ! but we know the maximum is 200000, so we can fix the size.\n\n    Actually, the problem says the array dp is of size 200001. So we can do:\n\n        integer, dimension(1:200000) :: positions   ! we are going to store integers from 1 to 200000.\n\n    But note: what if n>200000? The problem does not specify. The original Java program uses 200001. So we assume n<=200000.\n\n    Read n.\n\n    Then loop i=1 to n:\n        read x\n        positions(x) = i   ! storing the 1-indexed position.\n\n    Then compute the sum:\n\n        ans = 0\n        do i = 2, n\n            ans = ans + abs(positions(i) - positions(i-1))\n        end do\n\n    Then we have the sum as an integer (ans).\n\n  3. Convert the integer `ans` to a string.\n\n    We can use internal write.\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        write(str1, '(I0)') ans   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces.\n\n    But note: the integer `ans` might be up to 200000*1 (if the positions are increasing) but worst-case? The maximum absolute difference per step is 200000, and there are 200000 steps? Actually, n is at most 200000, so the maximum sum is about 200000 * 200000 = 40e9, which is within the range of a 64-bit integer. But the Java program uses `long` for `ans`. In Fortran, we should use integer(kind=8) for `ans`? Or the problem states n<=200000, so the maximum sum is about 40e9, which is beyond 2e9 (32-bit integer). So we must use a 64-bit integer.\n\n    Therefore, we should declare:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans   ! or integer*8\n\n    And the positions array: the indices are 1..n, which are at most 200000, so 32-bit is enough.\n\n    But the absolute differences: |positions(i)-positions(i-1)| might be up to 200000, and we are adding 199999 of them? Then the maximum sum is about 200000*200000 = 40e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer? 2e9 is the limit for 32-bit signed integers. 40e9 is 40,000,000,000 which is greater than 2e9. So we must use 64-bit integers.\n\n    Therefore:\n\n        integer :: n, i, x\n        integer, dimension(200000) :: positions   ! 32-bit is enough for positions (max 200000)\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n    Then we convert `ans` to a string.\n\n  4. Now we have the string `str1` (the sum). Now we process the second program on this string.\n\n    We need to count the frequency of each character in the string `str1`. But note: the string `str1` is written without leading zeros, so it's just the digits? But what if the integer is negative? The problem states the sum is nonnegative.\n\n    We traverse the string and count each character (digit, and possibly minus sign? but nonnegative so no minus).\n\n    We need a frequency map for characters. Since the string is composed of digits, the characters are '0' to '9'.\n\n    We can use an integer array of size 0:255? Or we can use an array for the digits.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        integer :: freq(0:9) = 0   ! but we don't know the length of the string? Actually, we know the string is stored in `str1` and we know the length? But the internal write might have padded with spaces? We used '(I0)' so no leading spaces. But the string might have trailing spaces? Actually, we wrote to a fixed-length character variable (len=20). So we have to consider only the non-space part? Or we can trim? Actually, we should traverse the entire string and break when we hit a space? Or we can use the trimmed length.\n\n    How to get the actual length? We can use:\n\n        len_trim(str1)\n\n    Then:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str1\n        integer :: freq(0:9)   ! we'll index by the integer value of the digit? Or we can use the character representation.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            integer :: counts(0:255)   ! for each ASCII character\n\n        But we only care about digits? The string is composed of digits.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            integer :: i, j, len1, ch\n            len1 = len_trim(str1)\n            do i = 1, len1\n                ch = ichar(str1(i:i))\n                ! then increment counts for that ASCII code? But we don't know the range. Or we can use:\n\n            integer :: char_to_index\n            character :: c\n\n            We can do:\n\n                integer :: freq_counts(48:57) = 0   ! '0' is 48, '9' is 57.\n\n            Then:\n\n                do i = 1, len1\n                    c = str1(i:i)\n                    freq_counts(ichar(c)) = freq_counts(ichar(c)) + 1\n                end do\n\n            Then we traverse the keys? Actually, we only need to check the digits.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use an array of size 0:9 and map the character to the digit:\n\n            do i = 1, len1\n                read(str1(i:i), '(I1)') digit   ! but that is inefficient\n            or\n                digit = ichar(str1(i:i)) - 48\n                freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n\n            Then we don't need the full ASCII.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n            integer :: freq(0:9) = 0\n            integer :: digit, len1, i\n            character :: c\n\n            len1 = len_trim(str1)\n            do i = 1, len1\n                c = str1(i:i)\n                if (c >= '0' .and. c <= '9') then\n                    digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n                    freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then we count the number of digits that have odd frequency? Actually, we are counting the frequency of each digit in the string.\n\n        Then:\n\n            oddCount = 0\n            do i = 0, 9\n                if (mod(freq(i), 2) /= 0) then\n                    oddCount = oddCount + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n  5. Then we decide:\n\n        if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n            result_str = \"First\"\n        else\n            result_str = \"Second\"\n        end if\n\n  6. Then the third program: we have the string `result_str`. We must replace every comma by a space. But there are no commas. So we can simply:\n\n        output_str = result_str   ! and then we output output_str\n\n        However, we do:\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n                if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = ' '\n                else\n                    output_str(i:i) = result_str(i:i)\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        But since there is no comma, we can skip? But for correctness, we do it.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            output_str = result_str\n            do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n                if (output_str(i:i) == ',') then\n                    output_str(i:i) = ' '\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        But note: the string \"First\" and \"Second\" do not have commas.\n\n  7. Then we write the output:\n\n        write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)   ! because we want to output without trailing spaces? But the original third program outputs the entire string (with spaces) and then a newline. Actually, the third program does a println of the entire string (which might have trailing spaces? but we are replacing commas and then printing). But our `output_str` is the same as `result_str` and we are trimming? That would remove the trailing spaces? But the string \"First\" has no trailing spaces. However, we defined:\n\n            character(len=20) :: result_str, output_str\n\n        Then if we assign result_str = \"First\", then the rest of the string is spaces? Then when we write with trim, we get \"First\" without the trailing spaces. But the original third program outputs the entire string without trimming? Actually, in Java, the string \"First\" has 5 characters and the println outputs 5 characters and then a newline. In our Fortran, if we do:\n\n            write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)\n\n        it will output \"First\" and then a newline? That is the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            write(*, '(A)') output_str(1:len_trim(output_str))\n\n        But the trim function in the write is simpler.\n\n  However, note: the third program does not trim. It outputs the entire string that it read (with any leading or trailing spaces) but with commas replaced. But in our case, the string we are processing (from the second program) is either \"First\" or \"Second\", which are 5 and 6 characters. And we have stored in a string of length 20? Then we have trailing spaces. But we don't want to output the trailing spaces? The original third program outputs exactly the string that it read (which is without trailing spaces) and then a newline.\n\n  How did we form the result_str?\n\n        result_str = \"First\"   ! this will be 5 characters, but stored in a 20-character variable -> padded with 15 spaces.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            output_str = result_str   ! so output_str is 20 characters.\n\n        Then we replace commas (if any) by spaces? Then we write with trim? That will remove the trailing spaces. So we get the non-space part.\n\n        This is acceptable because the original third program outputs the string without the trailing spaces? Actually, the third program in Java reads a line (without the newline) and then outputs that string (without the newline) and then a newline. So the string does not have trailing spaces? Actually, the string from the second program is either \"First\" or \"Second\" without any spaces. So we can trim.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid trailing spaces by using:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: result_str, output_str\n\n        But we know the length: either 5 or 6.\n\n        However, we are going to do the replacement of commas and then output. We can form the output string without trailing spaces.\n\n  But for simplicity, we'll use fixed-length and then trim on output.\n\n  Steps summary:\n\n    integer(kind=8) :: ans\n    integer :: n, i, x, positions(200000)   ! positions for integers 1..200000\n    integer :: freq(0:9), digit, oddCount, len1\n    character(len=20) :: str1\n    character(len=20) :: result_str, output_str   ! 20 is enough for \"Second\" (6 characters) and for the integer string (up to 12 digits: 40e9 is 11 digits)\n\n    !

Convert ans to string\n    write(str1, '(I0)') ans   ! This writes without leading spaces, but the string is padded to the right with spaces? Actually, no: I0 writes the minimal width. Then the rest of the character variable is space? Because it's fixed length.\n\n    ! Now, for the second program: process the string str1\n    ! Count frequency of each digit in str1 (ignoring spaces? but we trim to the actual digits)\n    freq = 0\n    len1 = len_trim(str1)\n    do i = 1, len1\n        digit = ichar(str1(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n        if (digit >= 0 .and. digit <= 9) then\n            freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    oddCount = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n            oddCount = oddCount + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n        result_str = \"First\"\n    else\n        result_str = \"Second\"\n    end if\n\n    ! Now, the third program: replace commas by spaces in result_str\n    output_str = result_str   ! copy\n    do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n        if (output_str(i:i) == ',') then\n            output_str(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)\n\nBut note: the original first program reads the n integers. How are the integers arranged? They are in one line? Or one per line? The original Java program uses `s.nextInt()` which reads tokens. So they can be in one line or multiple.\n\n  In Fortran, we read with:\n\n        read(*,*) n\n        do i=1, n\n            read(*,*) x\n        end do\n\n  This will read the next n integers, regardless of line breaks.\n\n  However, if the integers are in the same line as n? Then the first read reads n, and then the next read for x1 will read from the same line? Or if there's only one integer per line? The Fortran list-directed read will skip over line breaks? Actually, it will read tokens until it gets n integers.\n\n  But the problem: the input is the same as for the first program. So we must read the same tokens.\n\n  This should be acceptable.\n\n  But note: the array `positions` is defined for indices 1..200000. But what if the integers we read are not in the range [1,200000]? The problem says it's a permutation of 1..n? So we assume that.\n\n  Also, we are storing the integer x at `positions(x)`. But if x is outside [1,200000]? Then we get an array index out of bounds. We assume the input is a permutation of 1..n, so x is in [1,n] and n<=200000.\n\n  But note: the Java program uses an array of size 200001 (so indices 0..200000). But we defined positions(200000) meaning indices 1..200000? Actually, in Fortran, if we declare `positions(200000)`, then the indices run from 1 to 200000.\n\n  How about if x=200000? Then we set positions(200000)=i. But if n=200000, then x can be 200000.\n\n  But if n>200000? The problem states n, and the array is 200001 in Java. So we assume n<=200000.\n\n  Actually, the problem does not specify n, but the array is 200001, so n<=200000.\n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  However, we must note: the loop for the sum goes from i=2 to n. We are using `positions(i)` and `positions(i-1)`. We assume that the integers 1,2,...,n are present? Because it's a permutation. So we have stored the positions for 1,2,...,n.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But what if the input integers are not a permutation? The problem says it is.\n\n  Now, we must compile with 64-bit integers for `ans`. We can use:\n\n        integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n        integer(kind=int64) :: ans\n\n  But for simplicity, we can use `integer*8` if the compiler allows.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n  Let me write the entire program accordingly.\n\n  One more issue: the array `positions` must be initialized? In Java, the array is initialized to 0. In Fortran, we don't initialize. So if we have an integer x that is not set? But we are reading a permutation of 1..n, so we will set every x in 1..n. Then when we do the loop for i=2 to n, we are accessing positions(2) to positions(n). But we set positions(1) to positions(n) (all). So we don't need to initialize.\n\n  But what about positions for integers not in the input? We don't access them. So it's safe.\n\n  Therefore, the complete Fortran code:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      integer :: n, i, x\n      integer, dimension(200000) :: positions   ! for integers 1 to 200000\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans\n      character(len=20) :: str1\n      integer :: freq(0:9), digit, oddCount, len1\n      character(len=20) :: result_str, output_str\n\n      ! Read n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      ! Read the n integers and store the position (1-indexed) of each integer\n      do i = 1, n\n          read(*,*) x\n          positions(x) = i\n      end do\n\n      ! Compute the sum of absolute differences for consecutive integers 1..n\n      ans = 0\n      do i = 2, n\n          ans = ans + abs(positions(i) - positions(i-1))\n      end do\n\n      ! Convert the sum to a string\n      write(str1, '(I0)') ans\n\n      ! For the string `str1` (the sum), count frequency of each digit\n      freq = 0\n      len1 = len_trim(str1)\n      do i = 1, len1\n          digit = ichar(str1(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n          if (digit >= 0 .and. digit <= 9) then\n              freq(digit) = freq(digit) + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Count the number of digits that have odd frequency\n      oddCount = 0\n      do i = 0, 9\n          if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n              oddCount = oddCount + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Determine the result string for the second program\n      if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n          result_str = \"First\"\n      else\n          result_str = \"Second\"\n      end if\n\n      ! Process the third program: replace commas by spaces (if any) in result_str\n      output_str = result_str\n      do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n          if (output_str(i:i) == ',') then\n              output_str(i:i) = ' '\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the final string\n      write(*, '(A)') trim(output_str)\n\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: the array `positions` is of size 200000. What if n is less than 200000? We are only using indices 1 to n? But we are storing positions for x in the input (which are from 1 to n). Then when we do the loop for i=2 to n, we are accessing positions(1) to positions(n). So we are safe.\n\n  However, what if n=0? Then the loop for reading the integers is skipped. Then the loop for the sum is from 2 to 0 -> no iterations. Then ans=0. Then we process the string \"0\". Then we output \"First\" because for the string \"0\": \n      freq(0)=1 -> oddCount=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true -> \"First\"\n\n  But the original first program for n=0? It would read n=0, then try to read 0 integers. Then the array dp is not set, but the loop for the sum is from 2 to 0? Actually, the loop: for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) ... when n=0, the loop runs from 2 to 0 -> no iterations. Then ans=0. Then output 0. Then the second program reads \"0\", and then outputs \"First\". Then the third program outputs \"First\". So it's consistent.\n\n  Therefore, we are done.\n\n  Let me test with a small example.\n\n  Example for the first program:\n\n      n=3\n      integers: 3 1 2\n\n      Then:\n          positions(3) = 1\n          positions(1) = 2\n          positions(2) = 3\n\n      Then the differences:\n          |positions(2)-positions(1)| = |?| -> positions(1)=2, positions(2)=3 -> |2-3| = 1\n          |positions(3)-positions(2)| = |?| -> positions(3)=1, positions(2)=3 -> |1-3| = 2\n          ans = 1+2 = 3\n\n      Then the string is \"3\"\n\n      Second program: \n          frequency: \n             '3' -> 1 (odd)\n          oddCount=1 -> output \"First\"\n\n      Third program: replaces commas (none) -> outputs \"First\"\n\n  So the final output is \"First\".\n\n  In Fortran, we output \"First\".\n\n  Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n  Note: I used `integer(kind=8)` for `ans`. Alternatively, we can use `integer(8)` or `integer*8` but the standard way is `integer(kind=8)` or using `selected_int_kind`. But for simplicity, we use `integer(kind=8)`.\n\n  However, to be more standard, we can use:\n\n      integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n      integer(kind=int64) :: ans\n\n  But since the problem does not specify the Fortran version, we use the simpler `integer(kind=8)`.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the array `freq` for digits: we defined as `freq(0:9)`. But we must initialize to 0. We did:\n\n        freq = 0\n\n  This is a valid Fortran 90 initialization.\n\n  Therefore, the final code:"
