In Java, subtracting '0' from a non-digit gives a negative or large number? Actually, the ASCII value of 'S' is 83, so next = 83 - 48 = 35. Then it uses that as a digit? Then the DP state becomes (base * 35 + pre) % 13.",

Then the third program uses `sc.next()`: the token is \"YES\" (without the newline) because the newline is whitespace and `next()` skips leading whitespace and then takes the next token until whitespace. But the output of the second program is a single token. So the third program gets the string without the trailing newline. Therefore, the string for the third program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", of length 3 or 2. Now, we simulate the DP:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        dp(0:L-1, 0:12) [0-indexed: L is the length, indices 0 to L-1, and mod 0..12]\n\n        base = 1\n        We process the string from last character to first (in the original string, the third program does: for i from 0 to L-1, it uses the character at position (L-1-i). So we can process the string in reverse order. For i in 0 to L-1 (i is the index in the reversed string, which corresponds to the original string's position L-1-i):\n\n          c = s(L-i: L-i) [if we index the string from 1: then the last character is at position L, then L-1, etc.]\n\n          if c == '?' then\n             for next = 0 to 9\n                 for each pre (0 to 12) we update dp(i, (base * next + pre) mod 13) by adding the count from the previous step (or 1 for i==0 and pre==0)\n          else\n             next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0') [but note: if c is a letter, then this will be a number that is not between 0 and 9]\n                 then for each pre (0 to 12) update dp(i, (base * next + pre) mod 13) by adding the count from the previous step (or 1 for i==0 and pre==0)\n\n          base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n        Then the answer is dp(L-1, 5) However, note: the Java program uses:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0)) So for i=0 (the first character in the reversed string, which is the last character of the original string):\n\n        if pre==0 then we add 1, otherwise 0. In Fortran, we can initialize:\n\n        dp = 0\n        For the first character (i=0):\n\n          if the character is '?', then we do for next=0 to 9:\n               index = mod(base * next, 13) [because pre=0] -> then dp(0, index) = dp(0, index) + 1\n\n          else:\n               next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')\n               index = mod(base * next, 13)\n               dp(0, index) = dp(0, index) + 1\n\n        But note: the Java code for the first character does:\n\n            dp[0][(base * next) % 13] += (pre==0?1:0) [and pre is 0, so we add 1]\n\n        Actually, the Java code loops over pre from 0 to 12. For the first character, the term (i>0? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0)) is 1 only when pre==0, and 0 otherwise. So for pre=0, it adds 1 for each next. Therefore, for the first character, we are effectively:\n\n            for each possible next (if '?' then 10 possibilities, else 1 possibility) we set:\n\n                state = (base * next) % 13\n\n                dp[0][state] += 1\n\n        Then for the next characters, we do:\n\n            for each pre (from 0 to 12) and for each next (if '?' then 0..9, else the fixed next) we add dp[i-1][pre] to dp[i][(base*next + pre) % 13]\n\n   So we can initialize:\n\n        dp(0, :) = 0\n        Then for the first character, we compute the state for each next and set dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1 Then for i from 1 to L-1 (the remaining characters in the reversed string):\n\n            for each pre (0..12) and each next (if the character is '?' then 0..9, else the fixed next value) we do:\n\n                 new_state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                 dp(i, new_state) = mod(dp(i, new_state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n        and then update base = mod(base * 10, 13) However, note: the base is updated after processing a character. The base for the next character is base * 10 mod 13. We must do the base update after processing the current character. Steps for the DP:\n\n        base = 1\n        for i = 0 to L-1:\n\n            if the current character (at position L-1-i in the original string) is '?' then\n                for next = 0 to 9\n                    for pre = 0 to 12\n                         state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                         if i==0:\n                             if pre==0 then add 1, else 0 -> but note we are iterating pre. Actually, we can split:\n\n                         Instead, we can do:\n\n                         if i == 0:\n                             then we don't look at pre (because the previous state is only defined for pre=0 and the value is 1 only for pre=0). But note the Java code loops pre from 0 to 12 and uses (pre==0?1:0). So for pre=0, we add 1, for pre>0, we add 0. So for i==0, we can do:\n\n                             state = mod(base * next, 13) [because pre=0]\n                             dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1\n\n                         for i>=1:\n                             for pre=0 to 12:\n                                 state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                                 dp(i, state) = mod(dp(i, state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n            else\n                next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0') [c is the character at position L-1-i]\n                if i==0:\n                    state = mod(base * next, 13)\n                    dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1\n                else:\n                    for pre=0 to 12:\n                         state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                         dp(i, state) = mod(dp(i, state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13) But note: the Java code does the same for both '?' and non '?'? Actually, for non '?' it does a fixed next. However, the above for i==0 in the 'else' part is the same as the non '?' part for i>=0? We can combine. Alternatively, we can avoid the if i==0 inside the loop by initializing the dp for the first character separately. We can do:\n\n        MOD_val = 1000000007\n        dp(0:12) for the current row, and we'll iterate over the string. We can do:\n\n          base = 1\n          ! Initialize the dp for the first character (i=0)\n          current = 0:12   -> we'll use a 1D array for the current row and update for each character.",

This does not match.)\n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But looking at the programs:\n   Program 1: outputs a string of n numbers (each 1 or 2) separated by spaces, without a newline at the end? Actually, it uses `System.out.print` for each and then a space. The last character is a space? Then there is no newline.\n\n   Program 2: expects a line of input. It reads the entire next line. So it would read the string produced by Program 1 (including the trailing space? and then the next line? But note: Program 1 does not output a newline at the end. So the entire output of Program1 is one line without a trailing newline? Actually, in Java, the print statements without newline would leave the cursor at the end of the line. Then when the program ends, the output is flushed and the next program would read that entire line.\n\n   However, the third program (Program 3) then runs and expects a string of digits and '?'. But the output of Program2 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is not the input that Program3 expects.\n\n This indicates that the chain as described by the problem does not necessarily form a coherent sequence? \n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n But the chain is:\n\n   Input for the entire system: the input for the first program.\n\n   Step 1: Run Program1 -> produces a string S1 (n integers separated by spaces, without a trailing newline? but note: the program does not output a newline at the end, so the output is a line without a terminating newline? Actually, when the program ends, the output is flushed and the line is complete. However, the next program reading a line would get the entire output of the first program as one line, including the trailing space?).\n\n   Step 2: Run Program2: reads a line (which is S1). Then it processes that line and outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (with a newline).\n\n   Step 3: Run Program3: reads a string (which would be the output of Program2, i.e., either \"YES\" or \"NO\"). But Program3 expects a string of digits and '?'. This is a problem.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to Program3 is the output of Program2.\n\n But Program3 is designed for a problem about divisibility by 13 and expects a string that may contain digits and '?'. The example input for Program3 might be \"??2?\" or \"1234\", etc. The output of Program2 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is not in the format that Program3 expects.\n\n Therefore, the chain as given is not coherent. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n Let me read the filenames:\n\n   File1: codeforces_421_A\n   File2: codeforces_49_A\n   File3: atcoder_ABC135_D\n\n They are from different problems. It seems arbitrary to chain them. \n\n The problem statement: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\"\n\n But without a clear specification of how the outputs and inputs are intended to be chained, and given the inconsistency, it is likely that the chain is not defined by the problem content but by the problem statement.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we must chain them as:\n\n   Input to the entire program: the input for the first program.\n\n   Output of the entire program: the output of the last program (Program3).\n\n But the output of Program1 is a string of numbers (with spaces) which becomes the input to Program2.\n\n The output of Program2 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (with a newline) which becomes the input to Program3.\n\n Then Program3 must be able to process either \"YES\" or \"NO\". However, Program3 expects a string of digits and '?'. It will fail on input \"YES\" because it tries to convert characters to digits (by subtracting '0').\n\n This indicates that the chain is broken.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the three programs are independent and not meant to be chained by their outputs? But the problem says they are executed in sequence with the output of one as the input to the next.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are provided as separate files, but the chain is intended to be:\n\n   The input to the entire system is the input for the first program.\n\n   Then the output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\n   Then the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n   Then the output of the third is the final output.\n\n However, the third program cannot process the output of the second.\n\n Given the confusion, I note that the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we are to simulate the entire chain in one Fortran program without intermediate I/O.\n\n How can we reconcile?\n\n Let me look at the inputs and outputs:\n\n   Program1 input: \n        n, a, b\n        then a integers for list1\n        then b integers for list2\n\n   Program1 output: a string of n tokens (each token is either '1' or '2') separated by spaces.\n\n   Program2 input: a string (the entire line from the previous output)\n\n   Program2 output: either \"YES\" or \"NO\"\n\n   Program3 input: a string (the entire output of Program2, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\")\n\n   Program3: then processes that string? But Program3 expects a string of digits and '?'. \n\n   The Program3 code: \n        char[] cs = sc.next().toCharArray();\n\n   For input \"YES\": \n        cs = {'Y','E','S'} -> then at the first iteration (i=0) it takes the last character 'S' (since it reverses by processing from the end) and tries to do: \n            if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') ... else: next = 'S' - '0' -> which is not a digit -> will give an invalid number.\n\n Therefore, the chain is not logically connected.\n\n This suggests that the three programs are from different problems and are not intended to be chained. However, the problem states they are.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I must assume that the problem is to chain them as described, even if the third program fails.\n\n But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if the third program would crash on the input from the second, then the Fortran program should also crash? But Fortran might not crash but produce wrong results.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the chain is not as the files are numbered? The problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\", so the order is given by the file order: File1, then File2, then File3.\n\n After careful thought, I think there is a mistake in the problem. However, as an AI assistant, I must do as instructed.\n\n Plan:\n\n  We will write a Fortran program that:\n\n    Step 1: Reads the input for the first program (n, a, b, then a integers for list1, then b integers for list2).\n\n    Step 2: Simulate the first program: produce a string of n tokens (each 1 or 2) separated by spaces. Note: the original first program does not output a newline at the end, but when we pass the string to the next step, we don't need to worry about the newline because the second program reads a line and ignores trailing spaces and non-alphabet characters.\n\n    Step 3: Instead of printing, we hold the string in a variable (let's call it `s1`).\n\n    Step 4: Now simulate the second program: it reads a string (which is `s1`). Then it finds the last non-space, non-question mark character, converts it to lowercase, and checks if it is one of the vowels or 'y'. Then it produces either \"YES\" or \"NO\". We hold this in a string variable `s2`.\n\n    Step 5: Now simulate the third program: it expects a string (which is `s2`). The third program processes the string from the end to the beginning, and does dynamic programming for modulo 13. Then it outputs the value of dp[length-1][5] modulo MOD.\n\n    Step 6: The entire program then outputs the result of the third program (a single integer).\n\n However, note: the third program outputs a long integer. But the chain of the three programs would have the final output as that integer.\n\n But wait: the third program's output is the final output? Yes, because it is the last program.\n\n But the third program expects a string of digits and '?' and we are giving it either \"YES\" or \"NO\". This will cause the third program to process:\n\n   For \"YES\": \n        Length = 3.\n        i=0: char at index 2 (last) is 'S'. Then it does: next = 'S' - '0' -> that is not a digit. In Java, subtracting '0' from a non-digit gives a negative or large number? Actually, the ASCII value of 'S' is 83, so next = 83 - 48 = 35. Then it uses that as a digit? Then the DP state becomes (base * 35 + pre) % 13. \n\n   This is not the intended behavior of the third program, but it is what the Java program would do.\n\n So we must simulate exactly that.\n\n However, note that the third program uses `sc.next()` to read the string. In Java, `sc.next()` reads the next token (by default, tokens are separated by whitespace). But the output of the second program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without any space). So `sc.next()` would read the entire string.\n\n How the third program works:\n\n   It reverses the string and processes from the last character to the first (in the original string, it processes from the end to the beginning).\n\n   For each character:\n        if it is '?', then it considers all digits 0-9.\n        else, it takes the digit (but note: we are giving it non-digit characters).\n\n   So for non-digit and non '?' characters, it treats them as their ASCII value minus '0'? which is an integer in the range of non-single-digit? That leads to a number between 0 and 9? No, because '0' is 48, so any character above '9' (which is 57) will yield a number >= 10? \n\n   The program then does:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\n   where `next` is that integer (which is 35 for 'S').\n\n   This is a flaw, but we must simulate it.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We must do:\n\n     1. Read the initial integers and two lists.\n\n     2. Build the string for the first program's output: a sequence of n tokens. Each token is either '1' or '2'. We'll build a string with n tokens separated by a space. But note: the first program outputs without a trailing newline.\n\n     3. Then use that string as input for the second program.\n\n        - We traverse the string from the end to find the last non-space, non-question mark character.\n        - Convert that character to lowercase (if it is uppercase) and check if it is one of 'a','e','i','o','u','y'. Then set a string to either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n     4. Then use that string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") as input for the third program.\n\n        - We need to simulate the DP in the third program. Note: the third program reverses the string and uses base factors (powers of 10 mod 13) for each digit position.\n\n        - The third program uses modulo (1e9+7).\n\n        - We must account for non-digit and non '?' characters: we convert them to a digit by: next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')   [but note: in Java, it's the same as the ASCII value difference].\n\n     5. Finally, output the result of the third program (the dp value for the entire string at remainder 5).\n\n However, note: the third program in Java uses base=1 and then updates base = base * 10 % 13 for each digit. And it processes the string from the last character to the first (so the first character in the string becomes the least significant?).\n\n Steps for the third program simulation:\n\n   Let s = the string from step 2 output (either \"YES\" or \"NO\")\n\n   Let L = len_trim(s)   [we consider the actual length without trailing spaces? but note: the third program uses the entire string, including trailing spaces? Actually, the second program's output does not have trailing spaces? It's either \"YES\" or \"NO\" without any extra spaces? because it uses println. So the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and then a newline? But note: the second program uses `System.out.println` which adds a newline. So the string passed to the third program would be either \"YES\\n\" or \"NO\\n\"? \n\n   However, the third program uses `sc.next()` which does not read the newline? It reads the next token. The token for \"YES\" or \"NO\" does not include the newline. So the string in the third program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the newline). \n\n   But the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(\"YES\");   // which is \"YES\" plus a newline.\n\n   Then the third program uses `sc.next()`: the token is \"YES\" (without the newline) because the newline is whitespace and `next()` skips leading whitespace and then takes the next token until whitespace. But the output of the second program is a single token. So the third program gets the string without the trailing newline.\n\n   Therefore, the string for the third program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", of length 3 or 2.\n\n   Now, we simulate the DP:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        dp(0:L-1, 0:12)   [0-indexed: L is the length, indices 0 to L-1, and mod 0..12]\n\n        base = 1\n        We process the string from last character to first (in the original string, the third program does: for i from 0 to L-1, it uses the character at position (L-1-i). So we can process the string in reverse order.\n\n        For i in 0 to L-1 (i is the index in the reversed string, which corresponds to the original string's position L-1-i):\n\n          c = s(L-i: L-i)   [if we index the string from 1: then the last character is at position L, then L-1, etc.]\n\n          if c == '?' then\n             for next = 0 to 9\n                 for each pre (0 to 12) we update dp(i, (base * next + pre) mod 13) by adding the count from the previous step (or 1 for i==0 and pre==0)\n          else\n             next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')   [but note: if c is a letter, then this will be a number that is not between 0 and 9]\n                 then for each pre (0 to 12) update dp(i, (base * next + pre) mod 13) by adding the count from the previous step (or 1 for i==0 and pre==0)\n\n          base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n        Then the answer is dp(L-1, 5)\n\n   However, note: the Java program uses:\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0))\n\n   So for i=0 (the first character in the reversed string, which is the last character of the original string):\n\n        if pre==0 then we add 1, otherwise 0.\n\n   In Fortran, we can initialize:\n\n        dp = 0\n        For the first character (i=0):\n\n          if the character is '?', then we do for next=0 to 9:\n               index = mod(base * next, 13)   [because pre=0] -> then dp(0, index) = dp(0, index) + 1\n\n          else:\n               next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')\n               index = mod(base * next, 13)\n               dp(0, index) = dp(0, index) + 1\n\n        But note: the Java code for the first character does:\n\n            dp[0][(base * next) % 13] += (pre==0?1:0)   [and pre is 0, so we add 1]\n\n        Actually, the Java code loops over pre from 0 to 12. For the first character, the term (i>0? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0)) is 1 only when pre==0, and 0 otherwise. So for pre=0, it adds 1 for each next.\n\n        Therefore, for the first character, we are effectively:\n\n            for each possible next (if '?' then 10 possibilities, else 1 possibility) we set:\n\n                state = (base * next) % 13\n\n                dp[0][state] += 1\n\n        Then for the next characters, we do:\n\n            for each pre (from 0 to 12) and for each next (if '?' then 0..9, else the fixed next) we add dp[i-1][pre] to dp[i][(base*next + pre) % 13]\n\n   So we can initialize:\n\n        dp(0, :) = 0\n        Then for the first character, we compute the state for each next and set dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1\n\n        Then for i from 1 to L-1 (the remaining characters in the reversed string):\n\n            for each pre (0..12) and each next (if the character is '?' then 0..9, else the fixed next value) we do:\n\n                 new_state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                 dp(i, new_state) = mod(dp(i, new_state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n        and then update base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n   However, note: the base is updated after processing a character. The base for the next character is base * 10 mod 13.\n\n   We must do the base update after processing the current character.\n\n   Steps for the DP:\n\n        base = 1\n        for i = 0 to L-1:\n\n            if the current character (at position L-1-i in the original string) is '?' then\n                for next = 0 to 9\n                    for pre = 0 to 12\n                         state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                         if i==0:\n                             if pre==0 then add 1, else 0 -> but note we are iterating pre. Actually, we can split:\n\n                         Instead, we can do:\n\n                         if i == 0:\n                             then we don't look at pre (because the previous state is only defined for pre=0 and the value is 1 only for pre=0). But note the Java code loops pre from 0 to 12 and uses (pre==0?1:0). So for pre=0, we add 1, for pre>0, we add 0.\n\n                         So for i==0, we can do:\n\n                             state = mod(base * next, 13)   [because pre=0]\n                             dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1\n\n                         for i>=1:\n                             for pre=0 to 12:\n                                 state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                                 dp(i, state) = mod(dp(i, state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n            else\n                next = ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0')   [c is the character at position L-1-i]\n                if i==0:\n                    state = mod(base * next, 13)\n                    dp(0, state) = dp(0, state) + 1\n                else:\n                    for pre=0 to 12:\n                         state = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n                         dp(i, state) = mod(dp(i, state) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n   But note: the Java code does the same for both '?' and non '?'? Actually, for non '?' it does a fixed next.\n\n   However, the above for i==0 in the 'else' part is the same as the non '?' part for i>=0? We can combine.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the if i==0 inside the loop by initializing the dp for the first character separately.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        MOD_val = 1000000007\n        dp(0:12) for the current row, and we'll iterate over the string.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          base = 1\n          ! Initialize the dp for the first character (i=0)\n          current = 0:12   -> we'll use a 1D array for the current row and update for each character.\n\n          Instead, we do:\n\n          Let dp_prev(0:12) be the state counts for the previous character (for i-1). For the first character, we start with an initial state: we consider that before the first character the number is 0? and then we are adding the first digit.\n\n          Actually, the Java code uses:\n\n            dp[0][(base * next) % 13] += 1   [because for pre=0, we add 1]\n\n          So we can set:\n\n            dp_prev(0) = 1   [this represents the state before reading any digit: the number is 0 mod 13]\n            and for the other states, 0.\n\n          Then for i=0 to L-1:\n\n            dp_curr(0:12) = 0\n\n            if the current character (at the reversed position) is '?', then we try next = 0 to 9\n            else, we set next to the digit value (which is the ASCII difference) and then do for that one next.\n\n            Then for each pre_state in 0..12:\n\n                 if dp_prev(pre_state) > 0 then\n                    for each next in the set of possibilities:\n                         new_state = (base * next + pre_state) % 13\n                         dp_curr(new_state) = mod(dp_curr(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD_val)\n\n            Then set dp_prev = dp_curr, and update base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n          Then after processing all characters, the answer is dp_prev(5)\n\n          But note: the Java code does:\n\n                base = base * 10 % 13;\n\n          at the end of the loop.\n\n          And the modulus: we do mod 13 for the state, and mod MOD_val for the count.\n\n   However, the Java code does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n            if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') {\n                for (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n                    for (int next = 0; next < 10; ++next) {\n                        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                ... \n            }\n            base = base * 10 % 13;\n        }\n\n   So the base is updated after the current character.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        base = 1\n        dp_prev(0:12) = [1, 0, 0, ...]   (only state0 has count 1)\n\n        do i = 0, len-1   (we are processing the i-th character in the reversed string, which is the original string's last character at i=0, then the second last at i=1, etc.)\n\n            dp_curr = 0   (array of 13 zeros)\n\n            c = s(len - i)   [if we index the string from 1 to len: then the last character is at index len, then the one before at len-1, ...]\n\n            if c == '?' then\n                do next = 0, 9\n                    do pre_state = 0, 12\n                        new_state = mod(base * next + pre_state, 13)\n                        dp_curr(new_state) = mod(dp_curr(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD_val)\n                    end do\n                end do\n            else\n                next_val = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n                do pre_state = 0, 12\n                    new_state = mod(base * next_val + pre_state, 13)\n                    dp_curr(new_state) = mod(dp_curr(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD_val)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n            base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n            dp_prev = dp_curr\n\n        end do\n\n        result = dp_prev(5)   [because we want the state 5 at the end]\n\n   Then output result.\n\n But note: the modulus for the state is mod13, and for the count is mod MOD_val (1000000007).\n\n However, the base is updated mod13? Yes, we do base = mod(base * 10, 13).\n\n   But note: base is an integer that we use mod13. So we can keep base mod13.\n\n   Also, the next_val might be large? But next_val is either 0-9 (if the character is a digit) or a negative or positive number if the character is a letter. However, when we do:\n\n        new_state = mod(base * next_val + pre_state, 13)\n\n   we must take mod13? Actually, the Java code does mod13. So we do:\n\n        new_state = mod(base * next_val + pre_state, 13)\n\n   But note: base is mod13, and next_val can be any integer? We must take mod13 for the entire expression? Yes, but we can do:\n\n        temp = base * next_val + pre_state\n        new_state = mod(temp, 13)\n\n        However, temp might be negative? Fortran mod for negative numbers: we can use modulo(a,13) which returns a nonnegative remainder.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        new_state = modulo(base * next_val + pre_state, 13)\n\n   to get a nonnegative remainder in [0,12].\n\n   But note: the value of next_val for non-digit characters can be negative? Only if the character has an ASCII value less than '0'. But in our case, the string is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are uppercase. The ASCII value of 'Y' is 89, so next_val = 89 - 48 = 41. Similarly, 'E' is 69 -> 21, 'S' is 83 -> 35, 'N' is 78 -> 30, 'O' is 79 -> 31. So they are positive.\n\n   But to be safe, we do modulo arithmetic.\n\n   Steps summary:\n\n      Step 1: Read the initial integers: n, a, b.\n      Step 2: Read a integers and store in an array (list1).\n      Step 3: Read b integers and store in an array (list2).\n\n      Step 4: Build the string s1: for i=1 to n, \n                if i is in list1 then token = '1'\n                else token = '2'\n                and then we append the token and a space? But note: the first program outputs n tokens with a space after each, including the last? So the string will be: \"1 2 1 ... 2 \" (with a trailing space). \n\n      Step 5: Now use s1 as input for the second program.\n\n                We need to find the last non-space and non-question mark character in s1.\n\n                But note: s1 has spaces and digits. There are no question marks. So we look for the last non-space character.\n\n                Let s1_trimmed = trim(s1)   -> but that removes trailing spaces. Then the last character is the last non-space? Actually, the original program does:\n\n                    for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                        if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n                            ch = s.charAt(i);\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                So we traverse from the end until we find a non-space, non-question mark. Since there are no question marks, we just look for non-space.\n\n                Then we take that character and convert to lowercase.\n\n                Then check if it is one of the vowels or 'y'. Then set s2 to \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n      Step 6: Now use s2 as input for the third program.\n\n                We simulate the DP as described above.\n\n      Step 7: Write the result (the integer from the DP, modulo MOD_val) as the final output.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We'll use:\n\n      integer, parameter :: MOD_val = 1000000007\n\n   For the first part:\n\n      integer :: n, a, b\n      integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n      read(*,*) n, a, b\n      allocate(list1(a), list2(b))\n      read(*,*) list1(:)\n      read(*,*) list2(:)\n\n   Build string s1:\n\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: s1\n      ! We know the maximum length: each token is 1 character and there are n-1 spaces, so total length = n + (n-1) = 2*n-1? \n      ! But note: the program outputs a space after every token, including the last? Then the length would be 2*n? (each token and a space, but the last space is also output). Then we have n tokens and n spaces? That would be 2*n.\n\n      Actually, the first program:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n              if (list1.contains(i+1)) \n                  System.out.print(1 + \" \");\n              else\n                  System.out.print(2 + \" \");\n          }\n\n      So it prints a token and then a space for each of the n elements. So the string has n tokens and n spaces? But the tokens are single-digit? Then the string has 2*n characters.\n\n      However, we can build the string by:\n\n          s1 = ''\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                 s1 = trim(s1) // '1 '   -> but this is inefficient.\n          end do\n\n      Alternatively, we can pre-allocate a string of length 2*n.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          allocate(character(len=2*n) :: s1)\n          s1 = ''\n          do i=1, n\n             if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                 if (i==1) then\n                     s1(1:2) = '1 '\n                 else\n                     s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '1 '\n                 end if\n             else\n                 if (i==1) then\n                     s1(1:2) = '2 '\n                 else\n                     s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '2 '\n                 end if\n             end if\n          end do\n\n      But note: the list1 is an array of integers that are the indices (starting at 1) that should be printed as 1. The rest as 2.\n\n      However, the list1 might not be sorted? But we don't care. We are checking for i in list1.\n\n      But note: the list1 contains integers that are the positions (i+1) that are in the first list.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          do i=1, n\n             if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                 s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '1 '\n             else\n                 s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '2 '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n      But note: the string is built from the first character to the last. The positions: \n          token for i=1: positions 1 and 2: '1 ' or '2 '\n          token for i=2: positions 3 and 4: '1 ' or '2 '\n          ...\n\n      Then the entire string is of length 2*n.\n\n   Step 5: Process s1 to get the last non-space character:\n\n          len_s1 = len(s1)   -> 2*n\n          ch = ' '\n          do i = len_s1, 1, -1\n             if (s1(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s1(i:i) /= '?') then\n                 ch = s1(i:i)\n                 exit\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          Then convert ch to lowercase? But in Fortran, we can use the function to convert to lowercase? There isn't a standard one, but we can do:\n\n          if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n              ch = char(ichar(ch) - ichar('A') + ichar('a'))\n          end if\n\n          Then check if ch is one of 'a','e','i','o','u','y'\n\n          if (ch=='a' .or. ch=='e' .or. ch=='i' .or. ch=='o' .or. ch=='u' .or. ch=='y') then\n              s2 = \"YES\"\n          else\n              s2 = \"NO\"\n          end if\n\n   Step 6: Process s2 with the DP:\n\n          len_s2 = len_trim(s2)   [but note: s2 is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so we can use len(s2) because there's no trailing space?]\n\n          However, we defined s2 as a string of length 3 for \"YES\" and 2 for \"NO\"? Actually, we can define:\n\n             character(len=3) :: s2   ! because \"YES\" is 3, \"NO\" is 2, but we can store in a string of length 3.\n\n          But we'll use:\n\n             len_s2 = len(s2)   ! if we define s2 with the exact length? Actually, we can set:\n\n             if (condition) then\n                 s2 = \"YES\"\n                 len_s2 = 3\n             else\n                 s2 = \"NO\"\n                 len_s2 = 2\n             end if\n\n          Then we simulate the DP:\n\n             integer :: base, i, j, k, next_val, pre_state, new_state, temp\n             integer, dimension(0:12) :: dp_prev, dp_curr\n             integer, parameter :: MOD_val = 1000000007\n\n             base = 1\n             dp_prev = 0\n             dp_prev(0) = 1   ! initial state: 0 mod13\n\n             do i = 1, len_s2   ! we are going to process the string from the last character to the first? \n                 But note: the third program uses the character at position (len_s2 - 1 - i) in the original string? Actually, we can reverse the string? \n\n                 Alternatively, we can traverse the string from the last character to the first. Since we are building the DP from the least significant digit (the last character) to the most significant (the first character), we can do:\n\n                 Let c = s2(len_s2 - i + 1: len_s2 - i + 1)   [if we index the string from 1 to len_s2, then the last character is at len_s2, then the one before at len_s2-1, ...]\n\n                 Actually, we want:\n\n                    i=0: character at len_s2 (the last)\n                    i=1: character at len_s2-1\n                    ...\n\n                 So for i in 0 to len_s2-1:\n\n                    c = s2(len_s2 - i : len_s2 - i)\n\n                 But we are iterating i from 0 to len_s2-1? Then we can do:\n\n                    do i_index = 0, len_s2-1\n                       pos = len_s2 - i_index   ! the position in the string: for i_index=0, we get the last character.\n\n                 In our loop we are using i as the index in the reversed string. We can do:\n\n                    do i = 0, len_s2-1\n                       c = s2(len_s2 - i : len_s2 - i)\n\n                 But note: the string indexing in Fortran: we can use:\n\n                    c = s2(len_s2 - i : len_s2 - i)   for i from 0 to len_s2-1.\n\n                 However, we can also reverse the string and then process from the first character to the last? That might be simpler.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can simply process the string from the last character to the first by a loop from i=len_s2 down to 1.\n\n                 But the DP algorithm in Java uses:\n\n                    for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n                         char c = cs[cs.length - 1 - i];\n\n                 So we can do:\n\n                    do i = 0, len_s2-1\n                         c = s2(len_s2 - i : len_s2 - i)\n\n                 Then:\n\n                    if (c == '?') then\n                         ... for next from 0 to 9\n                    else\n                         next_val = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n                    end if\n\n                 Then update the dp_curr as described.\n\n                 Then base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n\n             end do\n\n          Then the result is dp_prev(5)\n\n   Step 7: Print the result.\n\n   Note: the third program outputs the result modulo MOD_val.\n\n   However, note: the Java program does:\n\n        System.out.println(dp[dp.length - 1][5]);\n\n   So we output the integer.\n\n   But note: the entire chain of programs: the first program would have printed a string, the second a string, and the third an integer? But the problem says only the last block should output. So we only output the integer.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n        Reads the input for the first program: n, a, b, and the two lists.\n\n        Builds the string s1 of length 2*n.\n\n        Processes s1 to get s2 (a string of either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n        Processes s2 with the DP to get an integer result.\n\n        Writes the integer result.\n\n   However, note: the second program in the chain would have output a string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and the third program then reads that string. But in our simulation, we are not printing that string. We are passing it internally.\n\n   This satisfies: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n   We are reading only at the beginning and writing only at the end.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We must be cautious with the string s1: it has trailing spaces. The second program must see the same as if it read the output of the first program. So the string we build for s1 must have the trailing space.\n\n   The second program then looks for the last non-space character. That will be the last token (which is either '1' or '2') at the position 2*n-1? because the last token is at the end: the token is at 2*n-1 and the space at 2*n? Then the last non-space is at 2*n-1.\n\n   So we take the character at 2*n-1? Actually, the entire string is of length 2*n: the last token is at position 2*n-1 and then the space at 2*n.\n\n   Then the second program would take the token at 2*n-1 (which is the last token) and check if it is a vowel? But the token is either '1' or '2'. Then the second program would output \"NO\" because neither '1' nor '2' is a vowel or 'y'. \n\n   So the chain would be:\n\n        Input: \n            n, a, b, and the two lists.\n\n        First program: outputs a string of n tokens (each '1' or '2') each followed by a space.\n\n        Second program: reads that string. The last non-space character is the last token (which is the token for the n-th element). It is '1' or '2'. Then the second program outputs \"NO\".\n\n        Third program: reads the string \"NO\". Then it does:\n\n            base = 1\n            i=0: character = 'O' (because the string is \"NO\", the last character is 'O')? Actually, the string \"NO\" has two characters: \n                index0: 'N', index1: 'O'. \n            Then the third program reverses the string: \n                i=0: the last character is 'O' -> next_val = ichar('O') - ichar('0') = 79 - 48 = 31.\n                state = (1*31 + 0) % 13 = 31 % 13 = 5 -> so dp[0][5] = 1.\n\n            Then base = 1*10 %13 = 10.\n\n            i=1: character = 'N' -> next_val = 78-48=30.\n                for pre_state from 0 to 12: \n                   new_state = (10*30 + pre_state) %13 = (300 + pre_state) %13 = (300%13 = 300/13 = 23*13=299 -> 1, so 1+pre_state) mod13.\n                then for pre_state=5: new_state = (1+5)%13=6 -> dp[1][6] += dp[0][5] = 1.\n\n            Then base = 10*10 %13 = 100%13=9.\n\n            Then dp[1][6] = 1.\n\n            The answer is dp[1][5]? but we are at the end of the string and we want state 5? so 0.\n\n            Actually, the Java program outputs dp[dp.length-1][5] = dp[1][5] = 0.\n\n        Therefore, the final output is 0.\n\n   So the Fortran program should output 0.\n\n   But note: the chain might be different if the last token is '1'? It doesn't matter: the token is either '1' or '2', both are not vowels.\n\n   Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\", so the third program will always process \"NO\".\n\n   However, if the input to the first program changes, the last token might be different? But it will always be '1' or '2'. So the second program always outputs \"NO\", and the third program always processes \"NO\", and the answer is always 0? \n\n   But wait: the third program for \"NO\" gives 0? We computed that the final state is 6, and we want state 5 -> 0.\n\n   But what if the second program outputs \"YES\"? Then we would process \"YES\", which has 3 characters.\n\n        base = 1\n        i0: last character 'S' -> next_val=83-48=35 -> state0 = (1*35+0)%13 = 35%13=9 -> dp0[9]=1.\n        base = 10\n        i1: character 'E' -> 69-48=21 -> for pre_state=0..12: \n             state = (10*21 + pre_state) %13 = (210%13 = 210/13=16*13=208 -> 2, so (2+pre_state)%13.\n             for pre_state=9: state = (2+9)%13 = 11 -> dp1[11] +=1\n        base = 10*10%13=9\n        i2: character 'Y' -> 89-48=41 -> for pre_state=0..12:\n             state = (9*41 + pre_state) %13 = (369%13: 369/13=28*13=364, 5 -> (5+pre_state)%13\n             for pre_state=11: state = (5+11)%13=16%13=3 -> dp2[3] +=1\n        Then the answer is dp2[5]=0.\n\n   So regardless of \"YES\" or \"NO\", the answer is 0? \n\n   But note: the second program outputs \"NO\" in the chain, so we only get 0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if we run the Java chain on the same input, the third program would output 0.\n\n   Therefore, we output 0.\n\n   But note: the first program might not always produce the same last token? It depends on the input. But the last token is always the n-th element. And the second program always uses the last non-space character, which is the last token.\n\n   Since the last token is always either '1' or '2', the second program always outputs \"NO\", and the third program always outputs 0.\n\n   However, what if the input to the first program is such that the last token is '1'? Then the second program still outputs \"NO\", and the third program outputs 0.\n\n   So the entire chain always outputs 0? \n\n   But that seems odd. However, we are following the chain.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n   Let me test with a small input for the first program:\n\n        n=1, a=1, b=0, list1=[1]\n\n        Then the first program outputs: \"1 \" (without quotes, and without newline) -> a string of two characters: '1' and space.\n\n        The second program: the last non-space is the '1' -> then outputs \"NO\".\n\n        Then the third program: processes \"NO\" -> outputs 0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n   Code:\n\n      program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, a, b, i, temp, j, k, len_s1, len_s2\n        integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s1, s2\n        character :: ch\n        integer, parameter :: MOD_val = 1000000007\n        integer :: base, i_index, pos, next_val, pre_state, new_state, len_s2_used\n        integer, dimension(0:12) :: dp_prev, dp_curr\n        integer :: result\n\n        ! Step 1: Read the input for the first program\n        read(*,*) n, a, b\n        allocate(list1(a), list2(b))\n        read(*,*) list1\n        read(*,*) list2\n\n        ! Step 2: Build s1: a string of length 2*n\n        allocate(character(len=2*n) :: s1)\n        s1 = ''\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (any(list1 == i)) then\n                s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '1 '\n            else\n                s1(2*i-1:2*i) = '2 '\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 3: Process s1 to find the last non-space and non-question mark character\n        len_s1 = len(s1)\n        ch = ' '\n        do i = len_s1, 1, -1\n            if (s1(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s1(i:i) /= '?') then\n                ch = s1(i:i)\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Convert ch to lowercase if it is uppercase\n        if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n            ch = char(ichar(ch) - ichar('A') + ichar('a'))\n        end if\n\n        if (ch=='a' .or. ch=='e' .or. ch=='i' .or. ch=='o' .or. ch=='u' .or. ch=='y') then\n            s2 = 'YES'\n            len_s2_used = 3\n        else\n            s2 = 'NO'\n            len_s2_used = 2\n        end if\n\n        ! Step 4: Process s2 (with length len_s2_used) for the third program\n        base = 1\n        dp_prev = 0\n        dp_prev(0) = 1   ! initial state\n\n        do i_index = 0, len_s2_used-1\n            ! Get the character at position: len_s2_used - i_index\n            pos = len_s2_used - i_index   ! because the string s2 is stored without trailing spaces? and we are using the exact length.\n            if (s2(pos:pos) == '?') then\n                dp_curr = 0\n                do next_val = 0, 9\n                    do pre_state = 0, 12\n                        temp = base * next_val + pre_state\n                        new_state = modulo(temp, 13)\n                        dp_curr(new_state) = modulo(dp_curr(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD_val)\n                    end do\n                end do\n            else\n                next_val = ichar(s2(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\n                dp_curr = 0\n                do pre_state = 0, 12\n                    temp = base * next_val + pre_state\n                    new_state = modulo(temp, 13)\n                    dp_curr(new_state) = modulo(dp_curr(new_state) + dp_prev(pre_state), MOD_val)\n                end do\n            end if\n            dp_prev = dp_curr\n            base = modulo(base * 10, 13)\n        end do\n\n        result = dp_prev(5)\n        write(*,*) result\n\n      end program combined\n\n   However, note: the third program uses a 2D dp array for each index. But we are using a 1D dp_prev and dp_curr. This is correct because we only need the previous row.\n\n   But note: the above loop for i_index from 0 to len_s2_used-1: we are processing the last character first (i_index=0: last character, i_index=1: the one before last, ...).\n\n   This matches the Java code.\n\n   Let me test with s2=\"NO\" (len_s2_used=2):\n\n        i_index=0: \n            pos = 2 (the last character) -> 'O'\n            next_val = ichar('O')-48 = 79-48=31\n            base = 1\n            dp_prev = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (index0 to 12: 13 elements)\n\n            dp_curr = 0\n            for pre_state=0 to 12:\n                temp = 1*31 + pre_state\n                new_state = modulo(31+pre_state, 13) = modulo(31,13)=5, then 5+pre_state mod13? Actually, 31 mod13=5, then 5+pre_state mod13.\n\n                Actually, modulo(31+pre_state,13) = modulo(5+pre_state,13)\n\n                So for pre_state=0: state=5\n                pre_state=1: state=6\n                ... pre_state=8: state=13 mod13=0\n                pre_state=9: 14 mod13=1\n                ... \n\n            But note: we are adding dp_prev(pre_state) to dp_curr(new_state). Since dp_prev(pre_state) is 1 for pre_state=0 and 0 elsewhere, we only get:\n\n                new_state = 5+0 = 5 -> dp_curr(5)=1\n\n            Then set dp_prev = [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n            base = base*10 mod13 = 10\n\n        i_index=1:\n            pos = 1 -> 'N'\n            next_val = 78-48=30\n            base = 10\n            dp_curr = 0\n            for pre_state=0 to 12:\n                temp = 10*30 + pre_state = 300+pre_state\n                modulo(300,13)= 300 /13 = 23*13=299 -> 1, so 1+pre_state mod13.\n                new_state = modulo(1+pre_state,13)\n\n            Then for pre_state=5: new_state = (1+5)=6 -> dp_curr(6) += dp_prev(5)=1\n\n            Then dp_prev becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n            base = 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13=9\n\n        Then result = dp_prev(5)=0.\n\n        So we output 0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   Note: the string s2 must be defined with at least the length we use. We set s2 to 'NO' (which is 2 characters) or 'YES' (3). But we defined s2 as a deferred-length allocatable? Actually, we set:\n\n        s2 = 'NO'   or s2 = 'YES'\n\n   Then when we do:\n\n        len_s2_used = len_trim(s2)   -> but we know the length: 2 or 3.\n\n   But we set it explicitly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (condition) then\n            s2 = 'YES'\n            len_s2_used = 3\n        else\n            s2 = 'NO'\n            len_s2_used = 2\n        end if\n\n   And then use s2(1:len_s2_used) for the DP? But we are using positions 1 and 2 for \"NO\", and 1,2,3 for \"YES\".\n\n   The above code for the DP uses:\n\n        pos = len_s2_used - i_index   [for i_index in 0 to len_s2_used-1]\n\n   For \"NO\": \n        i_index=0: pos=2 -> 'O'\n        i_index=1: pos=1 -> 'N'\n\n   For \"YES\":\n        i_index=0: pos=3 -> 'S'\n        i_index=1: pos=2 -> 'E'\n        i_index=2: pos=1 -> 'Y'\n\n   That is the reverse order: from last character to the first.\n\n   This matches the Java program.\n\n   We output the integer.\n\n   Let me write the complete code.\n\n   Note: the third program might have a large string? But the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so only 2 or 3 characters. The DP loop is small.\n\n   We also note that the MOD_val is 1000000007.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the first program reads a integers and b integers. The reading of the integers: we read a integers for list1 and then b integers for list2.\n\n   We assume the input integers are given in separate lines or in one line? The original Java program uses `sc.nextInt()` which reads tokens. So we can read the integers in free format.\n\n   In Fortran: \n\n        read(*,*) list1   ! reads a integers\n        read(*,*) list2   ! reads b integers\n\n   This will work if the integers are separated by spaces and/or newlines.\n\n   We assume the input is as expected.\n\n   Code:"
