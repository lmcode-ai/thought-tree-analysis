Instead, we can:\n\n   - Use an array `freq` of integers, indexed by the ASCII value. Steps for step6:\n\n   integer :: freq(0:127) = 0   ! or from 32:127? but we have digits and '-', which are in the range 45 to 57? Actually, the minus is 45, and digits are 48 to 57. But we can cover 0:127. Then:\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s2)   ! s2 might have leading space? but we convert integer to string without spaces. ichar_val = ichar(s2(i:i))\n        freq(ichar_val) = freq(ichar_val) + 1\n   end do\n\n   Then oddCount = count of indices in freq (0:127) such that freq(i) > 0 and mod(freq(i),2) == 1.\n\n8.

Actually, mod(oddCount,2) is either 0 or 1. So mod(oddCount,2) /= 0 means mod(oddCount,2)==1. Therefore, we can write: if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n\nBut note: the condition in the original Java is: if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) So we use the same condition. Now, we write the Fortran program accordingly. We note:\n\n- We must use 64-bit integers for the initial products? The problem says long integers. In Fortran, we can use integer(8) for the variables.",

Similarly, we want to output without extra spaces. Let's adjust the output. Also, note: the first program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? Our conversion using `write(s1, '(I0)')` does that. We'll write the final output as:\n\n    write(*,'(A)') \"First\"\n\nor\n\n    write(*,'(A)') \"Second\"\n\nThis will output the string and a newline. We'll write the program accordingly. But note: the second step: when the string has a minus sign? For example, if result1 is negative, then the first character is '-'. Then:\n\n   i=1 (0-indexed index 0 -> even) -> expected 'g'\n   actual = '-' -> not equal -> so we subtract 1. This is consistent. Similarly, the third step: the frequency counts for the minus and digits. We are ready. One more note: the condition in the third step: \n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \nis implemented as:\n   if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then But note: mod(oddCount,2) can be negative? No, because oddCount is nonnegative. So the Fortran program is as below.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\nHowever, note that the first program (atcoder_ABC178_B) reads four long integers and outputs the maximum of the products: a0*a2, a1*a3, a0*a3, a1*a2.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ARC062_B) reads a string and computes a score. The score is computed by comparing each character in the string with an expected pattern (alternating 'g' and 'p'). For each position i:\n  - If i is even (0-indexed), expected is 'g'\n  - If i is odd, expected is 'p'\n  - If the actual character (his) is not equal to the expected (my), then:\n        if expected is 'p' (meaning we are in an odd index and we played p) then add 1 (because we won a point? but note: the problem says when my is p and his is not p, then we get 1? Actually, the rule: if my is 'p' and his is not (so his is 'g'?) then we get 1? But note the explanation: \n        The problem states: \n          if my != his:\n            score += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1;\n\nSo if my is 'g' (meaning I play g) and his is not 'g' (so his is 'p') then I lose: so -1.\n\nThe third program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string and counts the frequency of each character. Then it counts how many characters have an odd frequency. If the number of odd frequencies is 0 or 1 or an odd number, it prints \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nBut note: the first program outputs a single number (the maximum product) which is a long. The second program expects a string. So we have to convert the output of the first program (a number) to a string that becomes the input of the second program.\n\nSimilarly, the second program outputs a single integer (the score) and the third program expects a string. So the output of the second program (an integer) becomes the input string for the third.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\nStep 1: Read four long integers (a, b, c, d) -> compute max(a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c) -> output that number (as a string? but the first program uses System.out.println which outputs a number as a string).\n\nStep 2: Read a string (which is the output of step 1, so it's a string of digits). Then compute the score as described.\n\nStep 3: Read a string (which is the output of step 2, so it's a string of digits? because step2 outputs the integer score). Then compute the odd frequency count and decide between \"First\" and \"Second\".\n\nHowever, note that the second program is designed to process a string of 'g' and 'p'? But we are feeding it a string of digits. This is a problem because the second program expects characters that are either 'g' or 'p'. But in the original chain, the output of the first is a number and the second program is designed to read a string of arbitrary characters? Actually, the second program (atcoder_ARC062_B) is designed for a string of 'g' and 'p' as input. But we are feeding it the number from the first program? This is inconsistent.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program outputs a number (as a string, e.g., \"12345\") and the second program reads that string. However, the second program's logic is for a string of 'g' and 'p'. This would lead to incorrect behavior in the second program because it expects only the characters 'g' and 'p'. \n\nBut note: the problem states that the entire sequence must behave identically. So we must simulate the same data flow.\n\nTherefore, the chain is:\n\nInput for the first program: four long integers (from standard input)\n\nOutput of first program: one integer (the maximum product) as a string (with a newline? but the second program reads tokens? The second program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token. So the token is the string of the integer without the newline? Actually, the first program outputs the integer and then a newline. The second program's InputReader reads by tokens (using StringTokenizer). So the token would be the entire integer string.\n\nThen the second program processes that string: it iterates over each character. For each character at index i, it expects the character to be either 'g' or 'p'. But we are giving it digits? This will cause the condition `if (my != his)` to be true for every character? And the score will be computed arbitrarily.\n\nBut wait, the original chain is defined by the given Java programs. The second program was designed for a problem with a string of 'g' and 'p'. However, in the chain, we are feeding it the output of the first program (a number). So the behavior of the second program is undefined? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". We are to chain the programs as they are. So we must:\n\n1. Read the four long integers (from stdin) -> compute the max product -> that becomes a string (without worrying about the content for the next step).\n\n2. The second program takes that string (which is the max product) and processes it as a string of arbitrary characters. It does not care if they are digits or letters. It applies the same logic: for each character in the string, at index i, it sets:\n      my = (i % 2 == 0) ? 'g' : 'p'\n   Then it compares the actual character (his) at that position with my. Then updates the score.\n\n3. Then the third program takes the output of the second (which is the integer score) as a string and counts the frequency of each character (each digit and possibly a minus sign? because the score can be negative) and then decides if the number of odd frequencies is 0,1 or odd -> \"First\", otherwise \"Second\".\n\nSo we have to simulate the entire chain.\n\nSteps:\n\nStep 1: Read four integers (a, b, c, d) and compute:\n        result1 = max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d)\n\nStep 2: Convert result1 to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits; note: result1 is a nonnegative integer because the inputs are long and the products of integers? but note: the inputs can be negative? The problem says long integers, so they can be negative. So the string representation of the integer might include a minus sign?).\n\n        Then for each character in the string (including the minus if present) at index i (0-indexed):\n            expected_char = 'g' if i is even, 'p' if i is odd.\n            If the actual character (say c_i) is not equal to expected_char, then:\n                if expected_char is 'p', add 1 to the score.\n                if expected_char is 'g', subtract 1 from the score.\n\n        So the score is an integer.\n\nStep 3: Convert the score (from step2) to a string (if negative, include the minus sign). Then for each character in that string, count the frequency. Then count the number of characters that have an odd frequency. Then:\n        if (oddCount <= 1 or oddCount % 2 != 0) then output \"First\"\n        else output \"Second\"\n\nBut note: the third program does not know that the string is a number. It treats every character (including the minus) as a character.\n\nTherefore, we must write a Fortran program that:\n\n1. Reads four integers (or long integers) from standard input.\n\n2. Computes the maximum of the four products: a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.\n\n3. Converts that integer to a string (with the minus sign if negative).\n\n4. For the string from step3, compute the score as described (by iterating over each character and comparing with the expected pattern).\n\n5. Convert the score (an integer) to a string.\n\n6. For the string from step5, count the frequency of each character and then count how many characters have an odd frequency.\n\n7. If the number of odd frequencies is 0, 1, or an odd number, output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWe note:\n\n- The first step: the input is four integers. We'll read them as integers? But the problem says long. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for 64-bit integers.\n\n- The products might be very large? So we use 64-bit integers.\n\n- The score in step2: the length of the string from step1 might be up to 20? (because 64-bit integers: 19 digits plus a possible sign). So the score will be in the range of -20 to 20? Actually, each character mismatch gives \u00b11. The maximum absolute value of the score is the length of the string? But note: the string length is at most 21? (20 digits and a minus). So the score is an integer that can be represented as a 32-bit integer.\n\n- The third step: the string from step2 (the score) might be negative? So we have to convert the integer to a string including the minus sign.\n\nImplementation in Fortran:\n\nWe break down:\n\n1. Read the four integers (a, b, c, d).\n\n2. Compute:\n   p1 = a * c\n   p2 = a * d\n   p3 = b * c\n   p4 = b * d\n   result1 = max(p1, p2, p3, p4)   ! This is the result of the first program.\n\n3. Convert result1 to a string. We have to be cautious about negative numbers.\n\n4. For the string from step3, let s1 = that string. Then:\n   score = 0\n   do i = 1, len(s1)\n        if mod(i-1, 2) == 0 then   ! because Fortran strings are 1-indexed, so first character is at index 1 -> even index in 0-indexed? \n            expected = 'g'\n        else\n            expected = 'p'\n        end if\n        actual = s1(i:i)\n        if (actual /= expected) then\n            if (expected == 'p') then\n                score = score + 1\n            else\n                score = score - 1\n            end if\n        end if\n   end do\n\n5. Convert the integer `score` to a string, say s2.\n\n6. For the string s2, count the frequency of each character. We can use an array or a map? But the characters are limited: digits and possibly '-'. We can use an array indexed by character? But Fortran doesn't have maps. We can use an array of size 0:255? But we don't know the encoding. Alternatively, we can use a dictionary-like approach with a list of unique characters? Or we can use an array of integers for each possible character. Since the string is short (max 4 digits? because the score is between -20 and 20, so at most 3 characters? Actually, -20 to 20: the string length is 1 to 3) we can do:\n\n   - Create an array `freq` for characters? Actually, we can use an integer array of size 256 (for ASCII) but we don't need that. We can simply:\n\n   Step 6.1: Initialize an array for storing frequencies? But the set of characters is small: only the digits from '0' to '9' and '-'. We can create an array of size 128 (for ASCII) and set to zero.\n\n   Step 6.2: For each character in s2, increment the frequency for that character (by converting to ASCII index).\n\n   Step 6.3: Then count the number of characters that have an odd frequency.\n\n7. oddCount = 0\n   do i = 1, 128\n        if (freq(i) > 0) then\n            if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n                oddCount = oddCount + 1\n            end if\n        end if\n   end do\n\n   But note: we don't need to iterate the entire 128? We can iterate over the unique characters in s2? Alternatively, we can just iterate over the string and record the frequency of each distinct character? Since the string is short, we can do:\n\n   Alternatively, we can create a list of distinct characters and count the frequency? But the string is short.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   character(len=1) :: chars_in_s2(:)   ! but we don't know the distinct ones.\n\n   Instead, we can:\n\n   - Use an array `freq` of integers, indexed by the ASCII value.\n\n   Steps for step6:\n\n   integer :: freq(0:127) = 0   ! or from 32:127? but we have digits and '-', which are in the range 45 to 57? \n   Actually, the minus is 45, and digits are 48 to 57.\n\n   But we can cover 0:127.\n\n   Then:\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s2)   ! s2 might have leading space? but we convert integer to string without spaces.\n        ichar_val = ichar(s2(i:i))\n        freq(ichar_val) = freq(ichar_val) + 1\n   end do\n\n   Then oddCount = count of indices in freq (0:127) such that freq(i) > 0 and mod(freq(i),2) == 1.\n\n8. Then if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) == 1) then\n        write(*,*) \"First\"\n   else\n        write(*,*) \"Second\"\n   end if\n\nBut note: the original third program does:\n\n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n        \"First\"\n   else\n        \"Second\"\n\nSo in Fortran: \n   if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n\nHowever, note: the condition in the third program: \n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \n\nThis is equivalent to: \n   if (oddCount <= 1) OR (oddCount is odd) \n\nBut note: if oddCount is 0: condition true -> \"First\"\n          1: true -> \"First\"\n          2: false -> \"Second\"\n          3: true (because 3 is odd) -> \"First\"\n          4: false -> \"Second\"\n          5: true -> \"First\"\n\nSo we write:\n\n   if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) == 1) then\n\nBut note: mod(oddCount,2)==1 is the same as mod(oddCount,2)/=0? Actually, mod(oddCount,2) is either 0 or 1. So mod(oddCount,2) /= 0 means mod(oddCount,2)==1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n   if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n\nBut note: the condition in the original Java is: \n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\n\nSo we use the same condition.\n\nNow, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nWe note:\n\n- We must use 64-bit integers for the initial products? The problem says long integers. In Fortran, we can use integer(8) for the variables.\n\n- The input: four integers (we read as integer(8))\n\n- The first step: compute the products and the max.\n\n- Then we convert the max to a string. We can use internal write.\n\n- Then step2: process that string to compute the score.\n\n- Then convert the score to a string (again internal write).\n\n- Then step3: process that string to compute the odd frequency count.\n\n- Then output.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nNote: The chain must not have any extra I/O in the middle.\n\nWe structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    ! Step 1: Read four integers\n    integer(8) :: a, b, c, d\n    integer(8) :: p1, p2, p3, p4, result1\n\n    ! Step 2: We need a string for the first result and for the second result (score string)\n    character(len=50) :: s1, s2   ! 50 should be enough for integers\n\n    ! Step 3: Variables for the second step\n    integer :: i, score, len_s1\n    character :: expected, actual\n\n    ! Step 4: Variables for the third step\n    integer :: freq(0:127) = 0   ! frequency array for ASCII\n    integer :: oddCount, j, ascii_val\n    integer :: len_s2\n\n    ! Read the four integers\n    read(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\n    ! Compute the four products and the max\n    p1 = a * c\n    p2 = a * d\n    p3 = b * c\n    p4 = b * d\n    result1 = max(p1, p2, p3, p4)\n\n    ! Convert result1 to a string in s1\n    write(s1, '(I0)') result1   ! I0 means integer without leading spaces\n    ! But note: if negative, the minus will be included.\n\n    ! Now, compute the score for the second step\n    len_s1 = len_trim(s1)   ! we don't want trailing spaces? but the write without leading spaces, but the string is padded with spaces to the right? \n    ! Actually, when we write with '(I0)', the integer is written without leading/trailing spaces, but the variable s1 is 50 characters long. We need to trim the trailing spaces? \n    ! But note: the string s1 is written from the beginning. We can use:\n    !   len_s1 = 0\n    !   do i=1,50\n    !       if (s1(i:i) == ' ') exit\n    !       len_s1 = i\n    !   end do\n    ! Alternatively, we can use the trim function? But trim removes trailing spaces. Then we can use:\n    !   s1_trimmed = trim(s1)   but then we don't know the length? we can use len_trim(s1) to get the length.\n\n    len_s1 = len_trim(s1)   ! This gives the length without trailing spaces.\n\n    score = 0\n    do i = 1, len_s1\n        ! For the i-th character (1-indexed), the 0-indexed index is i-1.\n        if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n            expected = 'g'\n        else\n            expected = 'p'\n        end if\n        actual = s1(i:i)\n        if (actual /= expected) then\n            if (expected == 'p') then\n                score = score + 1\n            else\n                score = score - 1\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, convert score to a string in s2\n    write(s2, '(I0)') score\n    len_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n\n    ! Step 3: Count frequencies of each character in s2 (for the first len_s2 characters)\n    freq = 0\n    do i = 1, len_s2\n        ascii_val = ichar(s2(i:i))\n        if (ascii_val >= 0 .and. ascii_val < 128) then\n            freq(ascii_val) = freq(ascii_val) + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Count the number of characters that have an odd frequency (only for the ones that appeared)\n    oddCount = 0\n    do i = 0, 127\n        if (freq(i) > 0) then\n            if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n                oddCount = oddCount + 1\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, output \"First\" or \"Second\"\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n        write(*,*) \"First\"\n    else\n        write(*,*) \"Second\"\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nBut note: the original Java programs output without extra spaces? In Fortran, we use `write(*,*)` which adds a space at the beginning? Actually, we can use `write(*,'(A)')` to avoid the space.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n        write(*,'(A)') \"First\"\n    else\n        write(*,'(A)') \"Second\"\n    end if\n\nBut note: the original Java uses `System.out.println(\"First\")` which outputs \"First\" and then a newline.\n\nSimilarly, we want to output without extra spaces.\n\nLet's adjust the output.\n\nAlso, note: the first program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? Our conversion using `write(s1, '(I0)')` does that.\n\nWe'll write the final output as:\n\n    write(*,'(A)') \"First\"\n\nor\n\n    write(*,'(A)') \"Second\"\n\nThis will output the string and a newline.\n\nWe'll write the program accordingly.\n\nBut note: the second step: when the string has a minus sign? For example, if result1 is negative, then the first character is '-'. Then:\n\n   i=1 (0-indexed index 0 -> even) -> expected 'g'\n   actual = '-' -> not equal -> so we subtract 1.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, the third step: the frequency counts for the minus and digits.\n\nWe are ready.\n\nOne more note: the condition in the third step: \n   if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) \nis implemented as:\n   if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n\nBut note: mod(oddCount,2) can be negative? No, because oddCount is nonnegative.\n\nSo the Fortran program is as below."
