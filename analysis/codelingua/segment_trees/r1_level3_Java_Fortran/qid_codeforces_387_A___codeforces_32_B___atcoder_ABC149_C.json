Actually, the Java LocalTime.minusHours/minusMinutes wraps around. So:\n\n            totalMinutes = ( (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2) ) mod 1440 But if negative, we add 1440 until positive? Example: 00:30 - 01:00 = -30 minutes -> then mod 1440: 1440-30 = 1410 minutes -> 23:30. So we can do:\n\n            totalMinutes = mod( ( (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2) ), 1440 ) if (totalMinutes < 0) then\n                totalMinutes = totalMinutes + 1440\n            end if\n            Then: hour = totalMinutes / 60, minute = mod(totalMinutes,60)\n\n        Then format as a string: HH = hour formatted to two digits, MM = minute to two digits. But note: the modulus operation for negative: in Fortran, mod(a,b) for negative a might be negative? We can use modulo(a,1440) which is non-negative? Or adjust. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            totalMinutes = (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2)\n            totalMinutes = mod(totalMinutes, 1440)   ! but mod in Fortran for negative: \n            Actually, we want non-negative. So:\n\n            totalMinutes = modulo(totalMinutes, 1440)   ! This gives a result in [0, 1440) Then hour = totalMinutes / 60, minute = mod(totalMinutes,60) Then we have a string of 5 characters: two for hour, colon, two for minute. Step 3: Now, the string from step 2 (which is in \"HH:mm\") becomes the input to the second program. The second program decodes a string of '.' and '-'? But we have a string of digits and colon?

It just:\n            - when it sees a '.', it outputs 0 or 1 depending on state?",

Then the third program: input 22 -> becomes 23 -> which is prime -> output 23. Then the entire program for any input? outputs 23? But that is not the same as the example: \n            Input: \"10:00\" and \"05:00\" -> \n                time1: 10:00 -> 600 minutes\n                time2: 05:00 -> 300 minutes\n                diff = 300 minutes -> 5 hours -> timeString = \"05:00\"\n\n            Then step3: \n                '0' -> state true\n                '5' -> output '2' -> state false -> so far \"2\"\n                ':' -> state true\n                '0' -> output '2' -> state false -> now \"22\"\n                '0' -> state true -> no output. Then x=22 -> then 23. So output 23. Another example: \n            Input: \"00:00\" and \"00:00\" -> \n                diff=0 -> timeString=\"00:00\"\n                Then step3: as above -> \"22\" -> 23. Another example: \n            \"13:20\" and \"03:30\"\n                time1: 13*60+20 = 800\n                time2: 3*60+30 = 210\n                diff = 590 minutes -> 9 hours 50 minutes -> \"09:50\"\n\n            Step3:\n                '0' -> state true\n                '9' -> output '2' -> state false -> \"2\"\n                ':' -> state true\n                '5' -> output '2' -> state false -> \"22\"\n                '0' -> state true -> no output. Then 22 -> 23. So always 23? This is because the second program always outputs \"22\" for our timeString? But wait: the timeString for \"09:50\": \n            char1: '0' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char2: '9' -> state true -> output '2', then state false.\n            char3: ':' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char4: '5' -> state true -> output '2', then state false.\n            char5: '0' -> state becomes true -> no output. So yes, \"22\".",

Example: timeString = \"00:00\" -> \n            char1: '0' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output -> outLen=0.\n            char2: '0' -> non-'.' and state is true -> output '2' -> outLen=1 -> outputStr(1:1)='2'\n            char3: ':' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true (because after output we set state to false? then we set state to true) -> no output -> outLen=1.\n            char4: '0' -> non-'.' and state true -> output '2' -> outLen=2 -> outputStr(1:2)='22'\n            char5: '0' -> non-'.' and state becomes true? (after the last output we set state to false? then we set state to true) -> no output. So we get \"22\" -> x=22.

Also, for x=3: \n        sqrtX = int(sqrt(3.0)) = 1 -> then the loop j=3 to 1 (step2) -> doesn't run -> so isPrime remains true? -> correct. For x=9: \n        sqrtX = 3 -> j=3: 9 mod 3=0 -> not prime -> then x becomes 11 -> then check 11: sqrtX=3 -> j=3: 11 mod 3 ! =0 -> prime. This matches. However, we must note: the original program does not check 2? in the divisor loop? and we are skipping even numbers? so we only check odd divisors? But our prime check for x>=3 and odd: we start j=3 and go to sqrtX, step2? Also, we don't check divisibility by 2? which is correct because x is odd.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first Java program (codeforces_387_A) reads two times in \"HH:MM\" format, subtracts the second time from the first, and prints the result in \"HH:mm\" format.\n 2. The second Java program (codeforces_32_B) reads a string of '.' and '-' and decodes it: \n      \".\" -> 0, \"-.\" -> 1, \"--\" -> 2.\n    But note: the program uses a state variable 's'. We have to replicate that decoding without I/O in the middle.\n 3. The third Java program (atcoder_ABC149_C) reads an integer and finds the next prime number (>= the input) that is either 2 or odd. It skips even numbers (except 2).\n\n However, note the instruction: \n    - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n    - Only the last block should produce output.\n\n Therefore, we must design the Fortran program to:\n    - Read the input for all three programs at the beginning? But the original programs are run in sequence with the output of one being the input of the next.\n\n How the chain works?\n    The original chain: \n        Program1: reads two times and outputs a time (in HH:mm format?).\n        Program2: reads a string (the output of program1) and decodes it to a string of digits.\n        Program3: reads an integer (the string of digits from program2) and outputs the next prime.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs a time string? Then the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. \n However, the output of the first program is a time string (e.g., \"02:34\") which contains digits and colon, but the second program expects only '.' and '-'. \n\n This indicates that the three programs are not intended to be chained? Or we have a problem.\n\n Let me reexamine:\n\n Program1: Input example: \n        First input: \"12:00\", Second input: \"10:00\"\n        Output: 02:00 (i.e., 12:00 minus 10:00 = 2 hours)\n\n Program2: Input: a string of '.' and '-' (like a morse code). Example: \".--.\" -> becomes \"0\" for the first '.', then next two: '-' and '.' -> 1, then last '.' -> 0 -> so \"010\".\n\n Program3: Input: an integer (from the string of digits of program2). Then finds the next prime >= that integer.\n\n There is a mismatch: the output of program1 is a time string (HH:mm) which is not composed of '.' and '-'. So they cannot be chained.\n\n Therefore, the problem might be that the three programs are independent? But the instruction says \"executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Alternatively, the example input might be:\n\n For the entire chain:\n\n  Input to the first program: two times (as in the first program) -> outputs a time string.\n\n  Then the time string becomes the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. \n\n This does not match.\n\n However, looking at the problem statement: we are to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\n\n We must assume that the input to the entire program is the input for the first program? And then the output of the first program is passed as input to the second, and then the output of the second to the third? And the final output is the output of the third.\n\n But the first program has two inputs (two time strings) and the second program has one input (a string of '.' and '-'). How do we reconcile?\n\n We must reinterpret: the entire chain has one input? Or the input for the entire program is the same as the input for the first program? Then the second program would take the output of the first as its only input? And the third the output of the second.\n\n However, the first program reads two tokens (two strings) from the input. So the entire program's input would be two tokens (the two times) and then the chain continues.\n\n But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. How can we convert the time string (like \"02:34\") to that? \n\n The problem does not specify. Therefore, we must assume that the chain is as given: the output of program1 is the input to program2, and the output of program2 is the input to program3.\n\n But the example of program1 output is a time string (with colons and digits) and program2 expects only '.' and '-'. \n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? \n\n But the instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After re-thinking: the three programs are from different problems and are not intended to be chained? \n\n However, the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we have to assume that the output of the first program (a time string) is the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. \n\n There is no way to reconcile unless we change the programs? But we are not allowed to change the logic.\n\n Alternatively, note that the first program outputs a time string that is in a fixed format? The second program, however, is designed for a different input. \n\n This suggests that the chain might be:\n\n  Input to the entire program is the two times for the first program? Then the output of the first program (a time string) is fed to the second program? But the second program would break because it expects '.' and '-'.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me look again at the original programs:\n\n Program1: reads two times and subtracts the second from the first? The subtraction might lead to negative? But the example in the code uses `minusHours` and `minusMinutes` and prints the time in the format of LocalTime (which is HH:mm). \n\n Program2: is a decoder for a string of '.' and '-'. \n\n Program3: finds the next prime.\n\n How can they be chained? \n\n I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So if we run:\n\n   java codeforces_387_A\n   input: \"10:00\" and \"05:00\" -> outputs \"05:00\"\n\n   Then we run:\n   echo \"05:00\" | java codeforces_32_B\n\n   But the second program expects a string of '.' and '-', and \"05:00\" contains digits and colon -> it would output something? \n\n   Let's simulate the second program with input \"05:00\":\n        n = \"05:00\".toCharArray() -> ['0','5',':','0','0']\n        Then we traverse:\n          i=0: '.'? -> no, it's '0' -> so else: s is false -> so set s=true -> output nothing.\n          i=1: '5' -> else: s is true -> then we output 2? and set s to false -> so output \"2\"\n          i=2: ':' -> '.'? no, it's ':' -> so else: s is false -> set s=true -> output nothing.\n          i=3: '0' -> else: s is true -> output 2 -> then set s to false -> so output \"2\"\n          i=4: '0' -> else: s is false -> set s=true -> output nothing.\n\n        So the output would be \"22\".\n\n   Then we run:\n        echo \"22\" | java atcoder_ABC149_C\n\n        This program reads an integer 22 and then finds the next prime >=22 that is odd (or 2). 22 is even -> skip? but note: if x != 2 and even -> x++ -> becomes 23. Then check 23: \n            sqrt(23) is about 4.8 -> check divisors: 23 mod 3 !=0 -> so prime? -> output 23.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain for input \"10:00\" and \"05:00\" would output 23.\n\n But note: the input to the entire chain is two time strings? And the output is an integer.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n Therefore, we design the Fortran program to:\n\n   Step 1: Read two time strings (each in \"HH:MM\" format) from standard input.\n\n   Step 2: Process the first program: \n        Parse the two time strings, compute the time difference (as a time of day? but note: LocalTime does modulo 24 hours). \n        We have to replicate the time subtraction. The Java LocalTime subtracts and wraps around? Actually, the subtraction of a time from a time in Java 8's LocalTime is not defined? \n\n        Actually, the code does:\n            LocalTime x = ... (first time)\n            LocalTime y = ... (second time)\n            Then: x.minusHours(y.getHour()).minusMinutes(y.getMinute())\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n            totalMinutesX = (hourX * 60 + minuteX)\n            totalMinutesY = (hourY * 60 + minuteY)\n            result = totalMinutesX - totalMinutesY   (in minutes)\n\n        But then it is represented as a LocalTime? which means it wraps around to a 24-hour day? \n\n        Example: \n            If x = 00:30 and y = 01:00, then:\n                00:30 minus 1 hour -> 23:30, then minus 0 minutes -> 23:30.\n\n        But note: the subtraction is done separately: first subtract hours, then subtract minutes.\n\n        Actually, the method `minusHours` and `minusMinutes` adjust within the 24-hour day.\n\n        How to do in Fortran? We can compute the total minutes since start of day for both times and then subtract? and then convert back to a time representation modulo 1440 minutes? \n\n        But the output format is HH:mm (with leading zeros for hour and minute?).\n\n        However, the next program (the second) expects a string? So we must format the result as a string in \"HH:mm\". But note: the hour part might be negative? Actually, LocalTime doesn't allow negative? It wraps. \n\n        We'll compute:\n\n            totalMinutes = (hour1 * 60 + minute1) - (hour2 * 60 + minute2)\n            Then adjust to be non-negative modulo 1440? But note: the subtraction in Java might wrap? \n\n        Actually, the Java LocalTime.minusHours/minusMinutes wraps around. So:\n\n            totalMinutes = ( (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2) ) mod 1440\n            But if negative, we add 1440 until positive? \n\n        Example: 00:30 - 01:00 = -30 minutes -> then mod 1440: 1440-30 = 1410 minutes -> 23:30.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            totalMinutes = mod( ( (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2) ), 1440 )\n            if (totalMinutes < 0) then\n                totalMinutes = totalMinutes + 1440\n            end if\n            Then: hour = totalMinutes / 60, minute = mod(totalMinutes,60)\n\n        Then format as a string: HH = hour formatted to two digits, MM = minute to two digits.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation for negative: in Fortran, mod(a,b) for negative a might be negative? We can use modulo(a,1440) which is non-negative? Or adjust.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            totalMinutes = (hour1*60+minute1) - (hour2*60+minute2)\n            totalMinutes = mod(totalMinutes, 1440)   ! but mod in Fortran for negative: \n            Actually, we want non-negative. So:\n\n            totalMinutes = modulo(totalMinutes, 1440)   ! This gives a result in [0, 1440)\n\n        Then hour = totalMinutes / 60, minute = mod(totalMinutes,60)\n\n        Then we have a string of 5 characters: two for hour, colon, two for minute.\n\n   Step 3: Now, the string from step 2 (which is in \"HH:mm\") becomes the input to the second program.\n\n        The second program decodes a string of '.' and '-'? But we have a string of digits and colon? \n\n        However, we saw in the example that the second program will process any string? It doesn't check for valid characters. It just:\n            - when it sees a '.', it outputs 0 or 1 depending on state? \n            - when it sees any other character (which in our case are digits and colon), it uses the state.\n\n        So we have to run the second program's logic on the string from step 2.\n\n        The state variable 's' (boolean) starts as false.\n\n        We traverse the string:\n\n          For each character in the string (which is 5 characters: e.g., \"23:59\"):\n\n            if the character is '.'? \n                then if s is true -> output '1' and set s=false\n                     else -> output '0'\n            else (meaning any character that is not '.', including colon and digits)\n                if s is true -> output '2' and set s=false\n                else -> set s=true\n\n        And note: we are building a string of digits (0,1,2) without spaces? \n\n        But the original program prints as it goes? So we need to build a string.\n\n        However, the next program expects an integer? So we can build the string and then convert to integer? Or we can build the integer as we go? \n\n        But note: the output of the second program is a string of digits (without spaces) and then the third program reads that as an integer.\n\n        We can build a string and then convert to integer for step 3.\n\n   Step 4: The third program: \n        We have an integer (from the string of step3). Then we find the next prime >= that integer that is either 2 or odd. We skip even numbers (except 2).\n\n        Steps for the third program:\n\n          x = integer from step3\n\n          If x==2, then we output 2? \n          If x is even and not 2, then set x = x+1 (so we start with an odd number).\n\n          Then while true:\n            Check if x is prime: \n                if x==2 -> prime.\n                else (x is odd): check divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to sqrt(x) (step 2).\n            If we find a divisor, break the inner loop and then x += 2 and try again.\n            If no divisor found, then break the outer loop and output x.\n\n   Step 5: Output the prime number.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We have to:\n        - Read the two time strings (each 5 characters? or we can read as two tokens? The original uses split on colon)\n\n        We assume the input is two tokens? But the input might be in one line? The original Java uses `sc.next()` twice. \n\n        Let's read the first string and the second string? We can read two strings.\n\n        Example input: \"10:00 05:00\"\n\n        Alternatively, we can read two strings (each 5 characters) but the colon is in the middle.\n\n        We can read two strings (each 5 characters) or we can read the entire line and split? \n\n        Since the original uses `sc.next()`, which reads tokens (by default space separated), we can read two strings.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read two strings (each representing a time, of the form \"HH:MM\")\n\n        Step 2: \n            Parse the first string: extract HH1 and MM1 (characters 1:2 and 4:5) -> convert to integers.\n            Similarly for the second string: HH2 and MM2.\n\n            totalMinutes1 = HH1*60 + MM1\n            totalMinutes2 = HH2*60 + MM2\n\n            totalMinutes = modulo(totalMinutes1 - totalMinutes2, 1440)   [but modulo with non-negative?]\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                diff = totalMinutes1 - totalMinutes2\n                totalMinutes = mod(diff, 1440)\n                if (totalMinutes < 0) totalMinutes = totalMinutes + 1440\n\n            Then:\n                hour = totalMinutes / 60\n                minute = mod(totalMinutes,60)\n\n            Format hour and minute to two-digit strings? \n\n            We create a string of 5 characters: \n                hourStr = adjusted to two digits (with leading zero if needed)\n                minuteStr = same\n                timeString = hourStr // ':' // minuteStr\n\n        Step 3: \n            We have the timeString (5 characters). Now we traverse each character of this string and apply the decoding of the second program.\n\n            We'll build a result string for the digits (which might be up to 5 digits? but note: the decoding may output one digit per character? but sometimes two characters yield one digit? Actually, the state machine: \n                when we see a non-'.' and state becomes true, we don't output until we see the next? \n\n            Actually, the second program outputs a digit for:\n                - every '.' encountered: either 0 or 1 (depending on state)\n                - every non-'.' when state is true: then we output 2 and reset state? \n                - but if we have consecutive non-'.', then the first sets state to true and the second then outputs 2 and resets.\n\n            However, at the end, if the state is still true? The original program does not output anything? \n\n            Example: input \"05\" (which is two non-'.' and then end) -> \n                first char: non-'.', state becomes true -> no output.\n                second char: non-'.', and state is true -> output '2', then reset state to false.\n                then end.\n\n            But what if we have an odd number of non-'.' at the end? The last one sets state to true and then there is no more? -> no output? \n\n            So the output string might be of length less than the input? \n\n            However, the next program expects an integer? We must form a string of the digits that are output.\n\n            We can build a string by appending the output digits.\n\n        Step 4: Convert the string of digits from step3 to an integer. Then apply the prime finding.\n\n        Step 5: Output the prime.\n\n   Important: The entire program must not do any I/O except reading the initial two strings and writing the final integer.\n\n   We'll design:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        !

This gives a non-negative result in [0,1440)\n        ! But note: modulo in Fortran: \n        !   modulo(diff, 1440) returns a result in the range [0, 1440) if diff is negative? \n        !   Actually, modulo(a,b) is a - floor(real(a)/real(b)) * b, so for negative a, it will be positive.\n\n        hour = totalMinutes / 60\n        minute = mod(totalMinutes, 60)\n\n        !

Step 6: Output the prime x\n        print *, x\n\n        end program\n\n   However, note: the third program also checks for 2? But if x is 2, we break immediately? \n\n   But in the above, if x is 2, we set isPrime to true and break the while loop? \n\n   But note: the condition for even: \n        if x is 2, we skip the even adjustment? because we have the if (x==2) then ... else if even then x++.\n\n   Actually, if x is 2, we do nothing? then we check: \n        isPrime: we set to true -> then exit -> output 2.\n\n   But what if x is 1? \n        The third program: \n            if x != 2 and even? 1 is odd -> so we don't adjust.\n            then check: \n                1: isPrime? -> no. Then we do x +=2 -> 3, then check 3: prime.\n\n        But note: the original program: \n            if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) then x++ -> so 1: not even -> skip.\n            then while true:\n                i=3 to sqrt(1) -> sqrt(1)=1 -> so the loop doesn't run -> then i>sqrt(1) -> break -> output 1? but 1 is not prime.\n\n        Actually, the original program does not handle 1? \n\n        The inner loop: for (i=3; i<=sqrtNum; i+=2) -> if x=1: sqrtNum=1, then i=3 and 3<=1 false -> so the loop is skipped -> then i>sqrtNum? -> i is 3 which is > 1 -> so it breaks -> output 1.\n\n        But 1 is not prime.\n\n        We must fix: the original program does not consider 1 as prime? \n\n        Actually, the original program does not handle 1? The condition: \n            if (i > sqrtNum) then break -> meaning prime? \n\n        But for x=1: the loop doesn't run -> i=3 and 3>1 -> so it breaks and outputs 1.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"find the next prime\" and 1 is not prime.\n\n        So the program is flawed? \n\n        But note the input: the input to the third program is from the second program. The second program outputs a string of digits that form a number. The number can be 0? or positive.\n\n        The third program: \n            It starts at x (if x is even and not 2, then x++ -> so x becomes odd) and then checks for prime.\n\n        How about we check for x=1? We must skip 1.\n\n        Actually, the original program does not handle 1? It will output 1? which is not prime.\n\n        We must fix the prime check to handle 1 and 2.\n\n        Let me adjust the prime checking:\n\n            if (x < 2) then not prime? \n            if (x == 2) then prime.\n            if (x is even) then not prime? but we skip even by adjusting? \n\n        But note: the original program does not adjust if x is 2? and if x is 1, it doesn't adjust? and then checks? \n\n        The problem: the original program outputs 1 for input 1? but 1 is not prime.\n\n        We must mimic the original? \n\n        The original program:\n\n            int x = ...;\n            if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n            while (true) {\n                int i;\n                double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n                for (i=3; i<=sqrtNum; i+=2) {\n                    if (x % i == 0) break;\n                }\n                if (i>sqrtNum) break;   // no divisor found -> prime\n                x += 2;\n            }\n            System.out.println(x);\n\n        For x=1:\n            x is not 2 and even? -> no, so x remains 1.\n            sqrtNum = 1.0\n            for loop: i=3, condition 3<=1 -> false -> so the loop is skipped -> so i becomes 3? then condition i>sqrtNum -> 3>1 -> true -> break -> output 1.\n\n        So the original program outputs 1? which is not prime.\n\n        Therefore, we must do the same? \n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\".\n\n        So we output 1 if the second program outputs 1? \n\n        However, the second program: \n            The input to the second program is a time string? which is 5 characters? and we are decoding that to a string of digits? and then converting to integer? \n\n            The time string: the smallest hour is 00 and minute 00 -> totalMinutes=0 -> timeString=\"00:00\"\n            Then step3: \n                '0' (non-'.'): s becomes true -> no output.\n                '0': non-'.' and s is true -> output '2', then s becomes false.\n                ':': non-'.' and s is false -> s becomes true.\n                '0': non-'.' and s is true -> output '2', then s becomes false.\n                '0': non-'.' and s is false -> s becomes true -> then at the end we have s true but no output? \n                So the output string is \"22\", so x=22.\n\n            Then step4: we start at 22 -> even? -> then 23 -> prime? output 23.\n\n        How do we get 1? \n\n        Only if the second program outputs the string \"1\". \n\n        How can that happen? \n\n            timeString: must be such that the decoding yields \"1\".\n\n            Example: \n                timeString: \".:\" -> but that's not a valid time? \n\n            Actually, the timeString is always two digits, colon, two digits? so the first character is a digit? which is not '.'.\n\n            Therefore, the first character: non-'.' -> set s to true -> then next character: \n                if it's '.' -> then output '1' and reset s to false? -> then we have \"1\" and then the rest: colon and two digits? \n\n            But let's take timeString: \"0.:00\" -> but that's not a valid time? because the hour part is \"0.\"? \n\n            So we cannot have a '.' in the timeString? \n\n            The timeString is built from two two-digit numbers and a colon. The digits are 0-9 and the colon is ':'. \n\n            Therefore, the only chance for a '.' is if the hour or minute has a decimal? but we are writing integers.\n\n            So the timeString will never contain a '.'.\n\n            Then the second program will never output a '0' or '1'. It will only output '2' for non-'.' when the state is true? \n\n            And the state becomes true when we see a non-'.' and state was false? \n\n            So for the timeString of 5 characters (all non-'.'):\n\n                char1: state becomes true -> no output.\n                char2: state is true -> output '2', then state becomes false.\n                char3: non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n                char4: state true -> output '2', then state false.\n                char5: non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n\n            So the output string is \"22\", which is two digits? \n\n            Then the integer is 22.\n\n            Then the third program: 22 -> even -> becomes 23 -> prime? output 23.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe? \n\n        But what if the timeString is of length 0? or with a '.'? \n\n        We are building the timeString from integers: hour and minute. They are in [0,23] and [0,59]. \n\n        The string will always be 5 characters and contain no '.'.\n\n        So the second program will output a string of 2's? and the length? \n\n          The timeString has 5 non-'.' characters -> we output at positions 2 and 4? -> so two digits? \n\n        Therefore, the integer will be at least 0 (if we output \"00\")? but we output only 2's? \n\n        Actually, we output two 2's? so \"22\", which is 22.\n\n        But wait: the state at the end? \n\n          char1: state becomes true -> no output.\n          char2: output '2' -> state becomes false.\n          char3: state becomes true -> no output.\n          char4: output '2' -> state becomes false.\n          char5: state becomes true -> no output.\n\n        So the output string is \"22\", and then we read 22.\n\n        But what if the timeString has 1 character? It doesn't. It's fixed 5.\n\n        So the program is deterministic.\n\n   However, note: the original second program was designed for a string of '.' and '-'? but we are feeding a string without '.'? \n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Code:\n\n        We'll write the program as described.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java outputs without spaces? and we build a string of digits? then we convert to integer? \n\n   We'll do:\n\n        outputStr = ''   ! initialize\n        outLen = 0\n\n        do i=1,5   ! because timeString is 5 characters\n            c = timeString(i:i)\n            ... as above ...\n\n        Then convert the outputStr(1:outLen) to integer? \n\n        How to convert a string of digits to integer? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            read(outputStr(1:outLen), *) x\n\n        But if outLen is 0? then we have an empty string? \n\n        But in our example, outLen is 2? and we get \"22\".\n\n        But what if the timeString is different? \n\n        Example: timeString = \"00:00\" -> \n            char1: '0' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output -> outLen=0.\n            char2: '0' -> non-'.' and state is true -> output '2' -> outLen=1 -> outputStr(1:1)='2'\n            char3: ':' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true (because after output we set state to false? then we set state to true) -> no output -> outLen=1.\n            char4: '0' -> non-'.' and state true -> output '2' -> outLen=2 -> outputStr(1:2)='22'\n            char5: '0' -> non-'.' and state becomes true? (after the last output we set state to false? then we set state to true) -> no output.\n\n        So we get \"22\" -> x=22.\n\n        Another example: timeString = \"23:59\"\n            char1: '2' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char2: '3' -> non-'.' and state true -> output '2' -> state becomes false.\n            char3: ':' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char4: '5' -> non-'.' and state true -> output '2' -> state becomes false.\n            char5: '9' -> non-'.' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n\n        So again \"22\".\n\n        How about a timeString with a single non-'.'? We don't have that. \n\n        But note: the timeString is always 5 non-'.' characters? \n\n        Therefore, the output of the second program is always two '2's? so the integer is always 22? \n\n        Then the third program: input 22 -> becomes 23 -> which is prime -> output 23.\n\n        Then the entire program for any input? outputs 23? \n\n        But that is not the same as the example: \n            Input: \"10:00\" and \"05:00\" -> \n                time1: 10:00 -> 600 minutes\n                time2: 05:00 -> 300 minutes\n                diff = 300 minutes -> 5 hours -> timeString = \"05:00\"\n\n            Then step3: \n                '0' -> state true\n                '5' -> output '2' -> state false -> so far \"2\"\n                ':' -> state true\n                '0' -> output '2' -> state false -> now \"22\"\n                '0' -> state true -> no output.\n\n            Then x=22 -> then 23.\n\n        So output 23.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"00:00\" and \"00:00\" -> \n                diff=0 -> timeString=\"00:00\"\n                Then step3: as above -> \"22\" -> 23.\n\n        Another example: \n            \"13:20\" and \"03:30\"\n                time1: 13*60+20 = 800\n                time2: 3*60+30 = 210\n                diff = 590 minutes -> 9 hours 50 minutes -> \"09:50\"\n\n            Step3:\n                '0' -> state true\n                '9' -> output '2' -> state false -> \"2\"\n                ':' -> state true\n                '5' -> output '2' -> state false -> \"22\"\n                '0' -> state true -> no output.\n\n            Then 22 -> 23.\n\n        So always 23? \n\n        This is because the second program always outputs \"22\" for our timeString? \n\n        But wait: the timeString for \"09:50\": \n            char1: '0' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char2: '9' -> state true -> output '2', then state false.\n            char3: ':' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n            char4: '5' -> state true -> output '2', then state false.\n            char5: '0' -> state becomes true -> no output.\n\n        So yes, \"22\".\n\n        Therefore, the entire program always outputs 23.\n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n        The original chain: \n            First program: outputs a time string (like \"05:00\")\n            Second program: when fed \"05:00\" -> outputs \"22\"\n            Third program: when fed 22 -> outputs 23.\n\n        So it always outputs 23? \n\n        However, what if the timeString has a different pattern? \n\n        Actually, the timeString always has the same pattern: two digits, colon, two digits. And the digits are not '.'.\n\n        Therefore, the behavior is fixed: 23.\n\n        We can hardcode 23? but the problem requires to translate the entire sequence.\n\n        So we write the program as described? \n\n   However, note: the second program might output more than two digits? \n\n        Example: if the timeString had a '.'? but we don't have any.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the state at the end of the second program is not output? so we don't care.\n\n   Code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        character(5) :: time1, time2\n        integer :: h1, m1, h2, m2, totalMinutes1, totalMinutes2, diff, totalMinutes, hour, minute\n        character(5) :: timeString\n        logical :: s\n        character(5) :: inputStr  ! we'll set to timeString, which is 5 characters\n        character(10) :: outputStr\n        integer :: i, outLen\n        character :: c\n        integer :: x, j, sqrtX\n        logical :: isPrime\n\n        !

This gives non-negative modulo 1440\n\n        hour = totalMinutes / 60\n        minute = mod(totalMinutes, 60)\n\n        !

Now, decode timeString with the second program's logic\n        s = .false.\n        outLen = 0\n        outputStr = ''   ! initialize to blanks\n\n        do i=1,5\n            c = timeString(i:i)\n            if (c == '.') then\n                if (s) then\n                    outLen = outLen + 1\n                    outputStr(outLen:outLen) = '1'\n                    s = .false.\n                else\n                    outLen = outLen + 1\n                    outputStr(outLen:outLen) = '0'\n                end if\n            else\n                if (s) then\n                    outLen = outLen + 1\n                    outputStr(outLen:outLen) = '2'\n                    s = .false.\n                else\n                    s = .true.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        !

Check divisibility by 2? but we made x odd? so skip even divisors? \n                sqrtX = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n                do j=3, sqrtX, 2\n                    if (mod(x,j) == 0) then\n                        isPrime = .false.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end if\n\n            if (isPrime) exit\n            x = x + 2\n        end do\n\n        print *, x\n\n        end program\n\n   But note: in the prime check, if x==2 we set isPrime to true? and break? \n\n   Also, for x=3: \n        sqrtX = int(sqrt(3.0)) = 1 -> then the loop j=3 to 1 (step2) -> doesn't run -> so isPrime remains true? -> correct.\n\n   For x=9: \n        sqrtX = 3 -> j=3: 9 mod 3=0 -> not prime -> then x becomes 11 -> then check 11: \n            sqrtX=3 -> j=3: 11 mod 3 !=0 -> prime.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, we must note: the original program does not check 2? in the divisor loop? and we are skipping even numbers? so we only check odd divisors? \n\n   But our prime check for x>=3 and odd: we start j=3 and go to sqrtX, step2? \n\n   Also, we don't check divisibility by 2? which is correct because x is odd.\n\n   Therefore, the program is complete.\n\n   But note: the output of the entire program is 23? for any input? \n\n   We run:\n\n        Input: \"00:00 00:00\" -> \n            diff=0 -> timeString=\"00:00\"\n            Then the second program: \n                '0' -> state=true\n                '0' -> output '2', state=false -> outputStr=\"2\"\n                ':' -> state=true\n                '0' -> output '2', state=false -> outputStr=\"22\"\n                '0' -> state=true -> no output.\n            Then x=22 -> then x becomes 23 -> prime? -> output 23.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   But note: the original first program outputs the time in the format of LocalTime? which uses a leading zero for single-digit hours? which we do (I2.2).\n\n   Therefore, we are consistent.\n\n   Let me test with a negative difference? \n\n        time1 = \"00:00\", time2 = \"00:01\": \n            diff = -1 minutes -> modulo(-1,1440)=1439? \n            Then hour = 1439/60 = 23, minute=1439 mod 60=59 -> \"23:59\"\n\n        Then the second program: \n            '2' -> state=true\n            '3' -> output '2', state=false -> \"2\"\n            ':' -> state=true\n            '5' -> output '2', state=false -> \"22\"\n            '9' -> state=true -> no output.\n\n        Then x=22 -> 23.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        We write the Fortran program as above.\n\n   Note: We assume the input is two strings (each 5 characters) on one line? \n\n        Example input: \"00:00 00:00\"\n\n   We use `read(*,*) time1, time2` which reads two tokens.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But note: the original Java uses `sc.next()` which reads tokens (space separated). So we assume the input is two tokens.\n\n   If the input is one token? then it would fail? \n\n   But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The original first program reads two tokens.\n\n   Therefore, we assume two tokens.\n\n   We are done."
