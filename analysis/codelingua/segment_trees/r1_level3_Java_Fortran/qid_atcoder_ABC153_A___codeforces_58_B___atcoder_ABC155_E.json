Actually, the loop: i starts at n-1 = -1, and condition i>0 -> false. So the loop is skipped. So it outputs \"0 \\n\". Then the third program will read the token \"0\", which is a string of one digit. But what if n is negative? The first program's num is nonnegative (because h and a are positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the first program: if h is negative, then num=0. Then the second program gets n=0? So we must consider nonnegative num. However, the input h and a are from the user. The Java program reads them as integers. They could be negative? The first program:\n\n            It subtracts a from h until h<=0.",

But note: the extra element at index number.length() is initially 0, and we might get a carry that increments it to 1? Then if it becomes 10? Then we need to carry again? Then we would go out of bounds. However, the algorithm is designed for very long numbers? But we are using a small number (<=10^9). The maximum carry? The algorithm ensures that we never have a digit>=10 beyond the current index? But we have the condition that if we see 10 we set it to 0 and carry. So if the last digit (at index number.length()) becomes 10, we try to carry to an index that is beyond the array. How to fix? We should make the array one larger? But the Java program already made it one larger. So the array has size L+1 -> indices 0 to L. Then the loop runs for i=0 to L. Then when i=L, we might set digits[L+1] which is out of bounds.",

But in Fortran, we can make the array 0:len (so indices 0 to len) and then we can check at the last step: if we are at i=len and digits(len)==10, then we would need to set digits(len)=0 and then we would have an out-of-bounds write. We must avoid that. Alternatively, we can make the array one bigger: 0:len+1, and set digits(len+1)=0. Then if we have a carry at the last digit, we can handle it.

And the extra digit at index len is 0. How can a carry propagate to the extra digit? Example: \n            num = 9999999999 (10 nines) -> then the reversed array:\n\n                digits[0] = 9, digits[1]=9, ... digits[9]=9, and digits[10]=0. Now, process each digit:\n\n            i=0: 9 -> >5 -> carry: set digits[1] += 1 -> becomes 10? Then we set bills += 1 (because 10-9=1) -> then we carry to the next. Then when i=1: we see 10? Then we set digits[1]=0 and digits[2] +=1 -> then bills +=0 at this step? Then we process i=1: then we see 0 -> <5 -> bills +=0? Then i=2: we have 9+1=10? Then same. Eventually, we will get to i=9: then digits[9] becomes 9+1=10? Then we set digits[9]=0 and digits[10]=1. Then bills for i=9: we did 10-9=1? Then at i=9: we also had a carry so we set digits[10]=1. Then i=10: we have digits[10]=1 -> which is <5 -> so bills +=1. Then total bills = 10 (from the 10 nines: each 9 gives 1 bill) + 1 for the last digit? -> 11. Now, what happens in the Java program? The array is of size 11 (for a 10-digit number). The indices are 0..10. Then i=10 is valid. So no crash. Why? Because the array has size len+1 = 10+1 = 11, so index10 is the last. Then we don't go beyond. So the algorithm is safe for 10 digits? But what if we have 11 digits? Then the array is size 12, and the loop goes to i=11, then if we have a carry at i=11, we set digits[12] which is out of bounds. However, the input num is at most 10^9? Then it has at most 10 digits. So we are safe. Therefore, we can:\n\n            Let n = num If n==0, then:\n                len = 1\n                digits(0) = 0\n                digits(1) = 0   ? Actually, we need an extra digit at the end? The array has size len+1 -> 2 elements: indices0 and 1? Then we set digits(1)=0. Else:\n                We extract the digits in base10 (least significant first) and count the number of digits, say L.\n                Then we set an array of size 0:L, and set digits(L)=0 (the extra digit at the end). Then we run the algorithm for i from 0 to L (inclusive). Steps for the third program:\n\n          Step 3.1: If num==0, then:\n                    digits = [0, 0]   -> index0:0, index1:0? But then we process i=0: digits[0]=0 -> <5 -> bills=0. then i=1: digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=0? But the algorithm: for i from 0 to L (inclusive) -> L=1? Then we run for i=0 and i=1. However, the Java program for \"0\": \n            String number = \"0\", then digits array of size 2: \n                digits[0] = '0' (from the last char) -> 0? digits[1] = 0 (by default? the array is initialized to zeros? the Java program only sets the first L (which is 1) digits? Then digits[1] is the extra and is 0. Then the loop: i from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\n            i=0: \n                digits[0] is 0 -> no 10, then <5 -> bills +=0.\n            i=1: digits[1] is 0 -> <5 -> bills +=0. Then total bills=0? But the algorithm: we start with 0. We don't need any bills? That's correct. However, the original Java program for \"0\" would output 0. So we do:\n\n            bills = 0\n            do i = 0, L   ! L is the length of the reversed string (which is the number of digits we extracted, which is 1 for 0) -> then we run i=0 and i=1? But note: the Java program sets the array for the string \"0\" as:\n\n            digits[0] = 0   (because the string is \"0\", reversed the last char is '0' -> 0)\n            and digits[1] = 0 (the extra)\n\n          Then the loop runs for i=0 and i=1. However, the algorithm:\n\n            i=0: if digits[0]==10 -> no\n                then if digits[0] <5 -> bills += digits[0] = 0.\n            i=1: if digits[1]==10 -> no\n                then if digits[1] <5 -> bills +=0. So total bills=0. But what if the number has L digits? Then we run i from 0 to L (inclusive). The extra digit at L is initially 0. Implementation:\n\n          We need an array of digits (0-indexed) from 0 to L, where L = number of digits we extracted (for non-zero: the number of digits; for zero: 1). And then we set the extra digit at index L to 0.",

Yes, the Java program does that. Let me test with a small number: Example: num=1 -> string \"1\", reversed: [1,0] (digits[0]=1, digits[1]=0)\n\n          i=0: \n            digits[0]=1 -> <5 -> bills=1\n          i=1: digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=1+0=1.\n\n          Output=1. Example: num=9 -> [9,0]\n          i=0: 9 -> >5 -> bills += 10-9=1, then carry: digits[1] becomes 1 -> then we set bills=1.\n          i=1: digits[1]=1 -> <5 -> bills=1+1=2? But wait: the algorithm does for i=0: bills=1, then for i=1: bills=1+1=2? However, the expected bills for 9?",

We can use three 10 and one 5: that's 4 bills. So why is the change method 40 and then 4 ones? The algorithm is greedy from the least significant digit:\n\n            d0=6: \n                We can use 6 ones -> 6 bills. Or we can use one 10 and get 4 change -> then we use 1 bill and get 4 bills as change -> total 5 bills? but the algorithm counts 10-6=4 (the change) and then adds one to the next digit? meaning we have to account for the 10 we used? Actually, the algorithm:\n\n            We are trying to avoid having to use too many ones? Step for the 6: \n                We choose to pay 10 and get 4 change -> then we have effectively increased the next digit by 1 (because we used one 10, which is 10^1, so we add 1 to the next digit) and we count the change (4 bills) -> 4. Then the next digit becomes 3+1=4? Then we pay 4 tens -> 4 bills. Total bills = 4 (change) + 4 (tens) = 8. Why not pay 5 and then 1? The algorithm has a branch for 5: \n            if the next digit is >=5, then we do the same as overpaying? How does it work for 5? For 5: \n                Option1: pay 5 ones -> 5 bills. Option2: pay 10 and get 5 change -> 5 bills? But the algorithm: if the next digit >=5, then we pay 10 and get 5 change? because then the next digit becomes one more? and if it is already high, we can reduce by carrying? For 36: \n            d0=6 -> we pay 10 and get 4 change -> bills=4, and next digit becomes 4. Then for d1=4: we pay 4 tens -> 4 bills, total=8. Alternatively, if we had d0=5 and d1=3: \n            d0=5: \n                since d1=3 <5, we don't carry? so we pay 5 ones -> bills=5. d1=3: pay 3 tens -> 3 bills, total=8. But if we do for d0=5 and d1=6: \n            d0=5: d1=6>=5 -> then we do: carry to d1: d1 becomes 7, and bills=5. Then d1=7: we pay 10 and get 3 change? -> bills=10-7=3? then carry to d2: d2 becomes 1? then d2: pay 1 -> 1 bill. Total = 5+3+1 = 9? Alternatively, we could for d0=5: pay 5 ones -> bills=5, then d1=6: pay 6 tens -> 6, total=11? \n\n          Or pay for d0=5: pay 10 and get 5 change: bills=5, then d1=6 becomes 7: then pay 7 tens? 7, total=12? \n\n          Or pay for d0=5: pay 5 ones? then for d1=6: pay one 50 and one 10? that would be 2 bills? total=5+2=7? The algorithm seems to be not optimal? But the known solution for the problem uses a DP. However, we are to mimic the given Java program. So we do as it does. Therefore, we output the Fortran program as described. Let me test with the sample 36: \n          num = 36 -> then we extract digits: \n            L = 2\n            digits(0) = 6, digits(1)=3, digits(2)=0. i=0: \n             6 -> greater than 5? -> bills += 10-6=4 -> then we add 1 to digits(1) -> digits(1)=4, bills=4. i=1: \n             digits(1)=4 -> less than 5? -> bills +=4 -> total=8. i=2: \n             digits(2)=0 -> bills +=0 -> total=8. So output 8. Therefore, the program is as below.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The first program (atcoder_ABC153_A) reads two integers (h and a) and calculates the number of times we can subtract 'a' from 'h' until h<=0.\n The second program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer n and then prints a sequence of numbers starting with n, then the largest divisor of n that is less than n, then the largest divisor of that, etc., until 1.\n The third program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string of digits (a big number) and calculates the minimum number of bills needed (a greedy algorithm for paying with minimal bills and coins, with denominations of powers of 10).\n\n However, note the instruction: the entire sequence is executed in sequence, with the output of one being the input of the next.\n\n The first program outputs an integer (num). The second program expects an integer (n) and outputs a sequence of integers (the last being 1). But note: the second program prints multiple numbers. However, the third program expects a string of digits.\n\n How do we chain?\n - The output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program.\n - The output of the second program is a sequence of integers (space separated) but the third program expects a single string (a big number). However, looking at the second program: it prints the initial number and then the divisors. The last number printed is 1. But the third program expects a single number.\n\n But note: the second program prints multiple numbers. We are supposed to chain the entire output of the second program as input to the third? That would be a string of numbers. However, the third program expects a single number (as a string). \n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n For the chain:\n   Input to the first program: two integers (h and a) on one line.\n   Output of the first program: one integer (num) -> becomes input to the second program.\n\n   The second program: reads one integer (n) and then prints a sequence of integers (the first is n, then divisors). But note: the output of the second program is multiple integers (each printed on a new line? Actually, the first print is without newline? Let's see:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This prints n and a space and then a newline? Actually, println adds a newline.\n        Then inside the loop: System.out.println(i + \" \");  // This also prints with a newline.\n\n   So the output of the second program is:\n\n        n [space]\\n\n        i1 [space]\\n\n        i2 [space]\\n\n        ...\n        1 [space]\\n\n\n   But the third program reads a single string (via sc.next()). The Scanner by default uses whitespace as delimiter. So sc.next() would read the first token? But note: the third program expects the entire number? However, the input to the third program is the entire output of the second program? That would be multiple tokens.\n\n This seems inconsistent.\n\n Let me look again at the problem: \"the entire sequence of programs\". We have to mimic the chaining. But note the original Java programs are independent and designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. When chaining, the entire output of the first program (one integer) becomes the entire input of the second program. The entire output of the second program (a sequence of integers, each on a new line) becomes the input of the third program.\n\n However, the third program reads with `sc.next()`, which reads the next token (the first token of its input). So if the second program outputs:\n\n        5 \n        4 \n        2 \n        1 \n\n Then the third program will read the string \"5\", and then try to process that as the number? But the third program is designed to process a string of digits (like \"1234567890\") and then convert each digit? Actually, the third program does:\n\n        String number = sc.next();\n        int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n        for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n            digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n        }\n\n So it expects a string of digits. But the output of the second program is multiple integers, each on a new line. The third program would only take the first token (the first integer, which is the same as the input to the second program) and ignore the rest? That doesn't seem right.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended to chain the output of the first program to the second, and then the output of the second program to the third? But the second program outputs multiple integers. How do we reconcile?\n\n After rethinking: the problem says \"the entire sequence\", meaning that we are to simulate the three programs in order, where the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n But the third program expects a string of digits (without spaces). The output of the second program is multiple integers (with spaces and newlines). This does not match.\n\n However, note that the second program's output is:\n\n        n (then a space and a newline)\n        then a series of integers (each followed by a space and a newline) until 1.\n\n The third program only reads the first token? So if the second program outputs:\n\n        6 \n        3 \n        1 \n\n Then the third program will read the string \"6\" and process the number 6? That would be inconsistent because the third program is designed for large numbers (like 10^1000000). But 6 is a small number.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended to use the entire output of the second program (as a string) as the input to the third? But the third program expects one token? And the second program outputs multiple tokens.\n\n How did the original chain work? We must mimic the behavior. But note: the original chain would be:\n\n        $ java atcoder_ABC153_A\n        (input: h and a)\n        (output: num)\n\n        $ java codeforces_58_B\n        (input: num from above)\n        (output: a sequence of numbers)\n\n        $ java atcoder_ABC155_E\n        (input: the entire output of codeforces_58_B? or just the first token?)\n\n The problem does not specify how the chaining is done. However, in typical shell chaining (using pipes), the entire output (including newlines) of one program becomes the input of the next. Then the third program's Scanner would read the first token (which is the first integer of the second program's output) and ignore the rest? That is not what we want.\n\n After reading the third program: it uses `sc.next()`, which reads the next token (delimited by whitespace). So only the first token (the first integer) is taken.\n\n Therefore, the chain would be:\n\n        First program: outputs one integer (without any extra spaces or newlines? Actually, it uses `System.out.println(num);` -> so one integer and a newline.\n\n        Second program: reads one integer (from the first line) and then produces a sequence of integers (each on a new line). But the third program only reads the first token of its input (which is the first integer of the second program's output). So the third program would use the same integer that the second program used as input? \n\n This means the chain:\n\n        Input to the first program: two integers (h and a)\n        First program: outputs num (which is the number of attacks needed: ceil(h/a))\n\n        Second program: takes num as input, and then outputs a sequence starting with num, then divisors. But the third program only uses the first token of the second program's output (which is num).\n\n        Then the third program uses the string representation of num to compute the bills.\n\n So effectively, the third program is using the same integer that was the output of the first program (and input to the second program). The rest of the output of the second program is ignored.\n\n Therefore, we can simplify the entire chain:\n\n        Step 1: Read h and a (two integers)\n        Step 2: Compute num = ceil(h / a)   [if h>0, then num = (h+a-1)/a, but note the loop: subtract a until h<=0]\n        Step 3: Use the string representation of num as input to the third program.\n\n But note: the second program also does a loop of divisors? However, since the third program only uses the first token (which is num) and the rest is ignored, we can skip the entire divisor computation? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must simulate exactly the same behavior. But note: the second program does output more than one integer. However, the third program does not read beyond the first token. So the rest of the output of the second program is not used. Therefore, we don't need to compute the divisors at all? \n\n But wait: what if the second program had side effects? It doesn't. So we can skip the divisor computation? However, the problem requires to reproduce the same behavior. The behavior of the second program is to output a sequence of divisors. But if the third program only reads the first token, then the rest of the output of the second program is left in the buffer? And if there were more programs, they would read the rest? But there are no more. So the entire output of the second program is written to standard output? But then the third program reads from standard input (which is the entire output of the second program). And the third program only consumes the first token. The rest of the tokens remain unread? But the third program doesn't read them. So it's safe.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are to write one Fortran program that does the same as the chain. We are allowed to avoid I/O in the intermediate steps. So we can:\n\n        Step 1: Read h and a (from input)\n        Step 2: Compute num = (h + a - 1) / a   [if h>0, but if h<=0 then num=0? The first program: for (i=1; h>0; i++) ... so if h<=0 initially, the loop doesn't run -> num=0. But note: the loop condition is h>0, and then subtract a. So if h<=0 initially, then num=0. But the input h is positive? The problem doesn't specify. We must be safe.)\n\n        Actually, the first program: \n            int num = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; h > 0; i++) {\n                h = h - a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n        This is equivalent to: num = ceil((double)h / a)  for positive h and a.\n\n        Step 3: We then take the integer num and we want to compute the bills for the number num (as a string). But note: the third program expects a string of digits (the number). So we convert num to a string.\n\n        However, note: the second program outputs num (as the first token) and then outputs divisors. But the third program only uses the first token (num). Therefore, we don't need to compute the divisors at all? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We must simulate the entire chain. However, if we skip the divisor computation, we are still producing the same input to the third program (the string of num). And the third program's computation only depends on the string of num. So we can skip the divisor computation? \n\n        However, the problem requires to reproduce the same behavior. The second program does output the divisors. But in the combined Fortran program, we are told that only the last block should produce output. The output of the entire Fortran program is the output of the third program. Therefore, the intermediate outputs (the divisors) are not part of the final output? \n\n        The problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we do not output the divisors. We only output the result of the third program.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the divisor computation? \n\n        But note: the third program might have been designed to read the entire output of the second program? However, it does not. It only reads the first token. So the divisors are irrelevant for the third program.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Read h and a.\n          Step 2: Compute num = (h + a - 1) / a   [if h<=0 then num=0, but if h>0 then we do integer division rounding up?]\n\n          Actually, the first program does:\n\n            num = 0\n            while h>0:\n                h -= a\n                num += 1\n\n          We can compute: num = (h-1)/a + 1   if h>0, but if h<=0 then 0? However, the problem states that h and a are positive? The problem does not specify, but the Java program does not check for negative. We assume nonnegative? The problem says \"same behavior\".\n\n          Step 3: Convert num to a string and then process the string as in the third program.\n\n        However, what if the second program had an effect on the state that we are missing? It doesn't. So we can skip the divisor computation.\n\n        But wait: what if the second program does not output the same num? It outputs the same num as the first program's output? Yes, because it reads num and then prints it as the first token.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the second program's divisor computation entirely.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are allowed to avoid I/O in the intermediate steps. So we can compute the divisors and then throw away the result? But that is inefficient. Alternatively, we can skip it because it is not used by the third program.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the entire chain is:\n\n            Input: two integers h and a.\n            Output: the result of the third program (which is an integer: bills) when the input to the third program is the string representation of num (the output of the first program).\n\n        So the divisors are not used.\n\n        However, the problem does not explicitly say that the intermediate outputs that are not consumed by the next program can be omitted. But note: the instruction says \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. We are not allowed to output anything until the last block. Therefore, we must avoid outputting the divisors. So we skip that computation.\n\n        Therefore, we can combine:\n\n            Read h and a.\n            Compute num = (h + a - 1) / a   [if h<=0, then num=0; but note: if h==0, then we skip the loop -> num=0. Also, if h<0, then num=0? The original loop condition: h>0. So for h<=0, the loop runs 0 times -> num=0.]\n\n            Now, we have to compute the third program on the string of num.\n\n        But note: what if the second program modifies the num? It doesn't. It uses the num as the starting point and then changes m, but the string we need is the original num.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the entire second program? \n\n        However, what if the second program had an error that crashes for certain inputs? Then we must simulate that? The problem says \"behaves identically\". But note: the third program only reads the first token (the original num) and then the rest of the second program's output is ignored. But the second program might crash for some num? For example, if num is 0? \n\n        Let's look at the second program:\n\n            int n = sc.nextInt();\n            System.out.println(n + \" \");\n            int m = n;\n            for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n                if (m % i == 0) {\n                    System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                    m = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n        If n is 0: then the loop runs for i from -1 down to 1? Actually, the loop: i starts at n-1 = -1, and condition i>0 -> false. So the loop is skipped. So it outputs \"0 \\n\". Then the third program will read the token \"0\", which is a string of one digit.\n\n        But what if n is negative? The first program's num is nonnegative (because h and a are positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the first program: if h is negative, then num=0. Then the second program gets n=0? So we must consider nonnegative num.\n\n        However, the input h and a are from the user. The Java program reads them as integers. They could be negative? The first program:\n\n            It subtracts a from h until h<=0. If a is negative, then subtracting a (which is negative) is adding a positive. Then the loop might run indefinitely? But note: the condition is h>0. If a is negative, then subtracting a negative makes h larger. Then the loop would run until h becomes negative? But h is increasing. So it would run until integer overflow? \n\n        But the problem says \"behaves identically\". We are not required to fix the original program. However, the original first program does not check for negative a. So we must mimic the same behavior.\n\n        How to compute num for negative values?\n\n          The loop: \n            num = 0\n            while (h > 0) {\n                h = h - a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n          For example:\n            h = 10, a = -2: \n                h becomes 12 -> then 14 -> ... -> runs forever? until num overflows? \n\n          But in practice, we cannot run forever. We must avoid this? The problem doesn't specify the input constraints. We assume the original intended inputs: positive h and positive a.\n\n        However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must mimic the infinite loop? But Fortran doesn't have undefined behavior? We can use the same condition: \n\n          num = 0\n          do while (h > 0)\n             h = h - a\n             num = num + 1\n          end do\n\n        But if a is negative, then this will run until h becomes so large that it overflows? Then we get a negative? Then the loop stops? But that would be a long time. We are not required to handle that? The problem says \"same input\", so we assume the inputs are as expected: positive h and positive a.\n\n        Therefore, we assume that the inputs h and a are positive integers. Then:\n\n          num = (h + a - 1) / a   [integer division truncates towards zero? But we want ceiling?]\n\n          Example: h=10, a=3 -> (10+3-1)/3 = 12/3=4 -> correct.\n\n          But in Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? For positive numbers, it's floor. But we want ceiling? \n\n          We can use: num = (h-1)/a + 1   if h>0, but if h==0 then 0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n             if (h <= 0) then\n                 num = 0\n             else\n                 num = (h - 1) / a + 1\n             end if\n\n        Now, for the third program: we take the string representation of num and then process it as in the third Java program.\n\n        The third program:\n\n            String number = sc.next();\n            int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n            for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n            }\n\n            Then it processes the digits array from least significant digit (at index0) to more significant.\n\n            The algorithm:\n\n                bills = 0\n                for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive) do:\n                  if digits[i] == 10:  // this is carry? then set to 0 and carry over\n                    digits[i+1] += 1\n                    digits[i] = 0\n                  if digits[i] < 5:\n                    bills += digits[i]\n                  else if digits[i] == 5:\n                    if digits[i+1] >= 5:   // note: the next higher digit (which is the next in the array) is at least 5?\n                         digits[i+1] += 1\n                    bills += 5\n                  else: // digits[i] > 5 and <10\n                    digits[i+1] += 1\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i]\n\n            Note: the array digits has length = number.length()+1. The extra element (initially 0) is at the end (which is the most significant digit? Actually, the digits are stored in reverse: the first element of the array is the least significant. The last element (index number.length()-1) is the most significant. The index number.length() is the extra one (initially 0).\n\n        We have to implement the same algorithm in Fortran.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Read h and a (as integers)\n          Step 2: Compute num (as described) -> integer\n          Step 3: Convert num to a string, then reverse the string to get the digits in reverse order? Or we can extract the digits by modulus.\n\n        However, note: the third program stores the digits in an array of size len+1. The digit at index0 is the least significant. So we can:\n\n          Let s = string representation of num (without leading zeros, and without sign, because num>=0)\n\n          Then create an integer array `digits` of length = len(s)+1, initialized to 0.\n\n          Then for i = 1 to len(s):\n              digits(i-1) = the i-th digit from the right? \n\n          Actually, we can:\n\n            len = len_trim(s)   ! length of the string\n            allocate digits(0:len)   ! or use an array of size len+1, indices 0 to len? But Fortran usually 1-based? We can use 1-based to avoid confusion.\n\n          But the Java program uses 0-indexed. We can use 0-indexed in Fortran? But Fortran arrays can start at any index. Let's use 0-indexed to match the algorithm.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the string conversion and extract the digits by modulus? But the number can be large? The first program: num = ceil(h/a). h and a are integers, so num is at most around 10^9? Then the string has at most 10 digits. So we can use modulus.\n\n        But the third program was designed for very large numbers (like 10^1000000). However, in our chain, the input to the third program is the integer num (which is at most around 10^9). So we can handle it as a string of up to 10 digits.\n\n        Steps for the third program:\n\n          Step 3.1: Convert the integer `num` to a string. But note: what if num is 0? Then the string is \"0\". Then the array of digits: \n                   digits[0] = '0' - '0' = 0, and then we process.\n\n          Step 3.2: We need an array of digits in reverse order? Actually, the Java program:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n            }\n\n          This sets:\n\n            digits[0] = last character of the string -> least significant digit? \n            digits[1] = second last, etc.\n\n          But the string is the usual representation (most significant first). So the Java program reverses the string to get the least significant at index0.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Write the number as a string (without leading zeros). Then reverse the string? Or we can extract the digits from the integer by modulus.\n\n          Since the number is small (<= 10^9), we can:\n\n            Let n = num\n            We will build an array of digits (least significant first) by:\n\n               i = 0\n               do while (n > 0)\n                  digit(i) = mod(n,10)\n                  n = n/10\n                  i = i+1\n               end do\n\n            But note: if num is 0, then we have no digits? Then we need to set digit(0)=0 and length=1.\n\n          However, the Java program also sets an extra digit at the end (index = length of the string) to 0. And the array has length = len+1.\n\n          We can create an array `digits` of size 0:max_digits (max_digits=10+1) and set the last element (index max_digits) to 0? But we don't know the length until we extract.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate the algorithm without building the entire array? But the algorithm is defined over an array that has an extra position (for carry).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let's let nd = number of digits in the usual representation? But we want the reverse. We can:\n\n            len = 0\n            temp = num\n            if (num == 0) then\n                len = 1\n                digits(0) = 0\n            else\n                do while (temp > 0)\n                    digits(len) = mod(temp,10)\n                    temp = temp/10\n                    len = len + 1\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          Then we have digits from index0 to len-1 (least significant at 0). And we set digits(len)=0 (the extra digit for carry).\n\n          Then we run the algorithm for i from 0 to len (inclusive). Note: the original Java program goes to number.length() (which is len in our representation) inclusive.\n\n          The algorithm:\n\n            bills = 0\n            do i = 0, len   ! including the last extra digit? But note: the last extra digit is at index=len, which is initially 0.\n                if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                    digits(i) = 0\n                    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                end if\n\n                if (i < len) then   ? But the algorithm does for i from 0 to len (inclusive). However, the condition for digits[i]==10 might cause an increment to digits[i+1] which is beyond len? But the array in Java has size len+1, so the last element is at index len. Then digits[i+1] for i=len would be out of bounds? \n\n          Actually, the Java array is of size len+1 (the original string length is L, then digits array has indices 0..L). The loop runs for i from 0 to L (inclusive). So when i=L, then:\n\n            if (digits[L] == 10) -> then set digits[L] = 0 and digits[L+1]++ -> but there is no index L+1? \n\n          However, the Java array has size L+1, so index L is the last. Then accessing index L+1 would be out of bounds? \n\n          But note: the Java program:\n\n            int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];   // indices 0 to number.length()\n\n          Then the loop: for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) ... \n\n          So i goes from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). When i = number.length(), then:\n\n            digits[i] is the last element (index number.length()).\n\n          Then in the body:\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) -> then digits[i+1]++ -> which would be index number.length()+1 -> out of bounds.\n\n          This is a bug? But note: the extra element at index number.length() is initially 0, and we might get a carry that increments it to 1? Then if it becomes 10? Then we need to carry again? Then we would go out of bounds.\n\n          However, the algorithm is designed for very long numbers? But we are using a small number (<=10^9). The maximum carry? The algorithm ensures that we never have a digit>=10 beyond the current index? But we have the condition that if we see 10 we set it to 0 and carry. So if the last digit (at index number.length()) becomes 10, we try to carry to an index that is beyond the array.\n\n          How to fix? We should make the array one larger? But the Java program already made it one larger. So the array has size L+1 -> indices 0 to L. Then the loop runs for i=0 to L. Then when i=L, we might set digits[L+1] which is out of bounds.\n\n          This is a potential buffer overflow. But in practice, the extra digit at index L is initially 0, and the algorithm: \n\n            We start processing from the least significant digit. The carries propagate to the left. The digit at index L is the most significant. If we have a carry from index L, then we would set digits[L+1] which does not exist.\n\n          We must extend the array by one more? But the original Java program doesn't. So it might crash for some inputs? \n\n          However, the problem says: we are to mimic the same behavior. So we do the same: we create an array of size len+1 (where len = number of digits in the reverse representation) and then when we get to i=len, we check if digits(len)==10, then we try to increment digits(len+1) which is out of bounds? \n\n          But in Fortran, we can make the array 0:len (so indices 0 to len) and then we can check at the last step: if we are at i=len and digits(len)==10, then we would need to set digits(len)=0 and then we would have an out-of-bounds write. We must avoid that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can make the array one bigger: 0:len+1, and set digits(len+1)=0. Then if we have a carry at the last digit, we can handle it. But the original Java program doesn't do that. \n\n          However, the original Java program might crash with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException? Then we should also crash? But Fortran doesn't have bounds checking by default? Or we can enable? The problem says \"behaves identically\". We are to write a program that produces the same output for the same input. If the Java program crashes, we should crash? But the problem does not say that. It says \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n          But note: the input to the third program is the string representation of num (which is the output of the first program). Since num is at most (h+a-1)/a, and h is an integer, and a is at least 1, then num is at most h (if a=1). So h is at most 10^9? Then the string has at most 10 digits. The most significant digit in the reversed array (at index len-1) is the first digit of the original number? And the extra digit at index len is 0. \n\n          How can a carry propagate to the extra digit? \n\n          Example: \n            num = 9999999999 (10 nines) -> then the reversed array:\n\n                digits[0] = 9, digits[1]=9, ... digits[9]=9, and digits[10]=0.\n\n          Now, process each digit:\n\n            i=0: 9 -> >5 -> carry: set digits[1] += 1 -> becomes 10? Then we set bills += 1 (because 10-9=1) -> then we carry to the next.\n\n          Then when i=1: we see 10? Then we set digits[1]=0 and digits[2] +=1 -> then bills +=0 at this step? Then we process i=1: then we see 0 -> <5 -> bills +=0? \n\n          Then i=2: we have 9+1=10? Then same.\n\n          Eventually, we will get to i=9: then digits[9] becomes 9+1=10? Then we set digits[9]=0 and digits[10]=1. Then bills for i=9: we did 10-9=1? Then at i=9: we also had a carry so we set digits[10]=1.\n\n          Then i=10: we have digits[10]=1 -> which is <5 -> so bills +=1. Then total bills = 10 (from the 10 nines: each 9 gives 1 bill) + 1 for the last digit? -> 11.\n\n          Now, what happens in the Java program? The array is of size 11 (for a 10-digit number). The indices are 0..10. Then i=10 is valid. So no crash.\n\n          Why? Because the array has size len+1 = 10+1 = 11, so index10 is the last. Then we don't go beyond.\n\n          So the algorithm is safe for 10 digits? \n\n          But what if we have 11 digits? Then the array is size 12, and the loop goes to i=11, then if we have a carry at i=11, we set digits[12] which is out of bounds.\n\n          However, the input num is at most 10^9? Then it has at most 10 digits. So we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n            Let n = num\n            If n==0, then:\n                len = 1\n                digits(0) = 0\n                digits(1) = 0   ? Actually, we need an extra digit at the end? The array has size len+1 -> 2 elements: indices0 and 1? Then we set digits(1)=0.\n\n            Else:\n                We extract the digits in base10 (least significant first) and count the number of digits, say L.\n                Then we set an array of size 0:L, and set digits(L)=0 (the extra digit at the end).\n\n            Then we run the algorithm for i from 0 to L (inclusive).\n\n        Steps for the third program:\n\n          Step 3.1: If num==0, then:\n                    digits = [0, 0]   -> index0:0, index1:0? But then we process i=0: \n                       digits[0]=0 -> <5 -> bills=0.\n                       then i=1: digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=0? \n                    But the algorithm: for i from 0 to L (inclusive) -> L=1? Then we run for i=0 and i=1.\n\n          However, the Java program for \"0\": \n            String number = \"0\", then digits array of size 2: \n                digits[0] = '0' (from the last char) -> 0? \n                digits[1] = 0 (by default? the array is initialized to zeros? the Java program only sets the first L (which is 1) digits? Then digits[1] is the extra and is 0.\n\n            Then the loop: i from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\n            i=0: \n                digits[0] is 0 -> no 10, then <5 -> bills +=0.\n            i=1:\n                digits[1] is 0 -> <5 -> bills +=0.\n\n            Then total bills=0? \n\n          But the algorithm: we start with 0. We don't need any bills? That's correct.\n\n          However, the original Java program for \"0\" would output 0.\n\n          So we do:\n\n            bills = 0\n            do i = 0, L   ! L is the length of the reversed string (which is the number of digits we extracted, which is 1 for 0) -> then we run i=0 and i=1? \n\n          But note: the Java program sets the array for the string \"0\" as:\n\n            digits[0] = 0   (because the string is \"0\", reversed the last char is '0' -> 0)\n            and digits[1] = 0 (the extra)\n\n          Then the loop runs for i=0 and i=1.\n\n          However, the algorithm:\n\n            i=0: \n                if digits[0]==10 -> no\n                then if digits[0] <5 -> bills += digits[0] = 0.\n            i=1:\n                if digits[1]==10 -> no\n                then if digits[1] <5 -> bills +=0.\n\n          So total bills=0.\n\n          But what if the number has L digits? Then we run i from 0 to L (inclusive). The extra digit at L is initially 0.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We need an array of digits (0-indexed) from 0 to L, where L = number of digits we extracted (for non-zero: the number of digits; for zero: 1). And then we set the extra digit at index L to 0.\n\n          Actually, we can set the entire array (0:L) to zeros, then extract the digits only for indices 0 to L-1? Then the last element (index L) is already 0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Read h and a.\n          Step 2: Compute num = 0\n                  if (h>0) then\n                     num = (h-1)/a + 1   ! integer division: truncates towards 0? But for positive, it's floor. \n                     ! Example: h=10, a=3 -> (10-1)/3 = 9/3=3 -> 3+1=4 -> correct.\n                  else\n                     num = 0\n                  end if\n\n          Step 3: Process the third program:\n\n                  if (num == 0) then\n                     L = 1\n                     allocate digits(0:L)   ! indices 0 and 1? Actually, L is the number of digits? For zero, we want one digit? Then we set:\n                     digits(0) = 0\n                     digits(1) = 0   ! but note: we have an array of size 2: indices 0 and 1? Actually, we want indices 0:L -> then L=1, so indices 0:1.\n\n                  else\n                     ! Count the number of digits, L0, of num (in base10) and extract the digits (least significant first) into an array of size 0:L0-1, then set L = L0, and then we need an array of size 0:L (so L0+1 digits: indices 0 to L0) and set the last to 0.\n\n                     Actually, we can:\n\n                         temp = num\n                         L = 0\n                         do while (temp > 0)\n                             digit = mod(temp,10)\n                             temp = temp/10\n                             L = L+1\n                         end do\n\n                         Then we create an array digits(0:L)   ! indices 0 to L, so size L+1\n                         Then set digits(L)=0   ! the extra digit\n\n                         Then we extract again? \n\n                     Alternatively, we can store the digits during the first loop. But note: the digits are in reverse order (least significant first). That's what we want.\n\n                     Steps:\n\n                         temp = num\n                         L = 0\n                         do while (temp > 0)\n                             digits(L) = mod(temp,10)   ! but we haven't allocated the array? We don't know L yet.\n\n                         So we can:\n\n                            ! First, count L\n                            temp = num\n                            L = 0\n                            temp2 = num\n                            do while (temp2 > 0)\n                                L = L+1\n                                temp2 = temp2/10\n                            end do\n\n                            allocate digits(0:L)   ! indices 0 to L\n                            digits(L) = 0   ! extra digit\n\n                            do i = 0, L-1\n                                digits(i) = mod(temp,10)\n                                temp = temp/10\n                            end do\n\n                         But note: the loop for extracting: we do L times? Then we set digits(0) to digits(L-1). Then we have the least significant at 0 and the most significant at L-1. Then the extra digit at L is 0.\n\n                  end if\n\n          Then run the algorithm:\n\n             bills = 0\n             do i = 0, L   ! including L\n                 if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                     digits(i) = 0\n                     if (i < L) then   ! because we cannot write beyond L? But our array goes up to L, and we are at i, so i+1 is in [0,L] only if i < L. But if i==L, then we would set digits(L+1) which is out of bounds? \n                         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                     else\n                         ! This should not happen? Because the extra digit is at L and we set it to 0, and we are processing i=L: then if it becomes 10, we would need to carry beyond. But the array doesn't have index L+1.\n                         ! So we must extend the array? But we don't. So we do:\n\n                         ! Actually, the algorithm in Java would crash? Or we are safe because we have an array of size L+1? and the loop runs for i from 0 to L (inclusive). Then when i=L, we have digits[L] and we set digits[L+1] -> out of bounds.\n\n                         ! How to avoid? We can make the array one bigger? But the problem says identical behavior. The original Java program has an array of size L+1 (for the string of length L, the array has size L+1). Then the loop runs i=0 to L. Then when i=L, if we have a carry, we set digits[L+1] -> crash.\n\n                         ! But in practice, for our num (which is at most 10^9) we have L<=10. The maximum value of the extra digit (at L) is 0 or 1? Then it can't be 10. So we are safe.\n\n                         ! Therefore, we assume that the extra digit (at L) is at most 1? Then we don't need to worry about it being 10.\n\n                         ! So we can do: if i==L, then we don't do the carry? But the algorithm says: if digits[i]==10, then set to 0 and carry. But we have no place to carry? Then we would get an error? \n\n                         ! We must mimic the Java behavior: an array index out of bounds? But we are in Fortran. We can let the array have index 0:L, and then when i==L and digits(i)==10, then we try to write to digits(i+1) which is out of bounds -> this is undefined in Fortran? Or we can check bounds? \n\n                         ! Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", and the Java program would crash for such input, we assume that for our input (which is at most 10^9) this situation does not occur.\n\n                         ! Therefore, we do:\n\n                         if (i < L) then\n                             digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                         else\n                             ! This should not happen for our input range? So we ignore? Or we extend the array? \n                             ! But note: the original Java program would crash. We are not required to handle beyond the specification? \n                             ! We'll assume that for our input (num <= 10^9) we never get a carry at the last digit (index L) that makes it 10? \n\n                         So we do the addition without checking the bound? Then if we go beyond L, we crash? \n\n                     end if\n                 end if\n\n                 if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                     bills = bills + digits(i)\n                 else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n                     if (i < L) then   ! because we need to check digits(i+1) only if it exists? \n                         if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                             ! But note: the algorithm in Java does this even if i+1 is beyond the array? \n                             ! Actually, the algorithm does not check bounds for digits[i+1] in the condition? It just accesses it. So if i==L, then we access digits(L+1) -> out of bounds.\n\n                     But wait: the condition is only checked when digits[i] is 5. And for our input, the extra digit at L is 0, and 0<5, so we don't do the carry. \n\n                 else\n                     bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n                     if (i < L) then\n                         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                     else\n                         ! same as above: we assume it doesn't happen.\n                     end if\n                 end if\n\n             end do\n\n          But note: the condition for 5: even if we are at the last digit (i=L), we still do the check: digits(i+1) is beyond the array? \n\n          How to avoid? We must check the bound for the condition of 5? The Java program does not. So it would crash? \n\n          Therefore, we must do:\n\n             For i from 0 to L:\n\n                 if (digits(i) == 10) then\n                     ...   [with bound check for the carry: if i<L then increment, else crash? but we assume it doesn't happen for our input]\n\n                 if (digits(i) < 5) then\n                     bills = bills + digits(i)\n                 else if (digits(i)==5) then\n                     if (i < L) then   ! because if i==L, then digits(i+1) is out of bounds? \n                         if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                             if (i+1 <= L) then   ! we know i+1 is at most L, which is in the array? \n                                 digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n                             else\n                                 ! beyond the array -> crash? \n                             end if\n                         end if\n                     else\n                         ! i==L: then we don't have digits(i+1). So we skip the condition? But the Java program would access digits[i+1] -> crash.\n\n                     So we must not do the condition when i==L? \n\n          However, the problem says we are to mimic the same behavior. So if the Java program would crash, we should crash? But the input num is at most 10^9, and L is at most 10. Then the last digit we process is at index L (which is the extra digit) and it is 0. Then we only get to i=10 (if L=10) and then:\n\n            if digits(10)==5? but it's 0 -> so we skip.\n\n          Therefore, for our input, we never hit the condition that requires an out-of-bounds access.\n\n          So we can write the algorithm without bound checks for the condition of 5? \n\n          But note: the condition for 5 requires the next digit (which is at index i+1). We have allocated the array to index L. So when i = L, we don't have digits(i+1). Therefore, we must skip the condition for i==L? \n\n          How about we run the loop for i from 0 to L-1 for the condition of 5? But the algorithm in Java runs for i from 0 to L (inclusive). And for i=L, if digits[i] is 5, then it will try to access digits[L+1] -> crash.\n\n          To avoid crashing for our input, we note that the last digit (index L) is 0. Then we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, we write the algorithm as in Java, assuming that the last digit (index L) is 0 and will not be 5.\n\n        Summary of the Fortran program:\n\n          program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: h, a, num, temp, L, i, digit, bills, temp2\n          integer, allocatable :: digits(:)\n          character(len=20) :: num_str   ! for debugging? not needed\n          integer :: ios\n\n          !

Yes, the Java program does that.\n\n        Let me test with a small number:\n\n          Example: num=1 -> string \"1\", reversed: [1,0] (digits[0]=1, digits[1]=0)\n\n          i=0: \n            digits[0]=1 -> <5 -> bills=1\n          i=1:\n            digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=1+0=1.\n\n          Output=1.\n\n          Example: num=9 -> [9,0]\n          i=0: 9 -> >5 -> bills += 10-9=1, then carry: digits[1] becomes 1 -> then we set bills=1.\n          i=1: digits[1]=1 -> <5 -> bills=1+1=2? \n\n          But wait: the algorithm does for i=0: bills=1, then for i=1: bills=1+1=2? \n\n          However, the expected bills for 9? We can pay with one 10 and get 1 change? or one 5 and four 1's? But the algorithm is designed to minimize the number of bills? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm in the Java program is known as \"minimum number of bills and coins\" for denominations 1, 10, 100, ... and also 5, 50, 500, ...? \n\n          For 9: \n            Option1: use 9 ones -> 9 bills.\n            Option2: use one 10 and get 1 change -> but that is 1 bill (for the 10) and then 1 bill for the change? total 2? \n            Option3: use one 5 and 4 ones -> 5 bills.\n\n          The algorithm outputs 5? But we got 2? \n\n          I see: the algorithm does:\n\n            For 9: \n                i=0: 9 -> >5 -> so we do: \n                   bills += 10-9 = 1\n                   then we add one to the next digit -> so the next digit becomes 1 (from 0) -> then we have 10 at the next? no, we don't check until we get there.\n\n            Then i=1: we have 1 -> <5 -> bills +=1 -> total 2.\n\n          Why is that? Because we are effectively paying 10 and getting 1 in change? Then the total bills is 10 (the bill we paid) plus the change we get? But the algorithm counts the change? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm is from a problem that counts the total number of bills used (both given and received). But the problem says: \"minimum number of bills needed\". \n\n          The known solution for the problem atcoder_ABC155_E uses a greedy from the least significant digit and considers two choices: either pay exactly or overpay and get change.\n\n          The algorithm we implemented is:\n\n            if digit < 5: we pay that many ones -> cost = digit\n            if digit == 5: we can pay 5 ones, or pay 10 and get 5 change? But the algorithm: \n                if the next digit is >=5, then we do the latter? why? Because then the next digit becomes one more, which might be reduced if it becomes 10? \n                and then we add 5? \n            if digit>5: we pay 10 and get (10-digit) change -> cost = 10 - digit, and then we add one to the next digit.\n\n          The total bills is the sum.\n\n          For 9: \n            digit0=9: we pay 10 and get 1 change -> 1 bill (for the 10) and we get 1 bill as change? but we have to return that 1 bill? Then the total bills used is 1 (for the 10) and then the change is given to us (so we don't count that as a bill we use?) \n\n          Actually, the problem might be: we are allowed to have the change as bills we receive? Then the net bills we use is 1 (the 10) but we get 1 back? So net 0? But that is not the case.\n\n          After reading the problem atcoder_ABC155_E: \n\n            Problem: We want to pay exactly N yen. We have bills: 1,10,100,... and 5,50,500,... \n            We can use any number of bills. What is the minimum total number of bills?\n\n          Then for 9: \n            Use 9 ones: 9 bills.\n            Use one 5 and four ones: 5 bills.\n            Use one 10 and get 1 change: then we use one 10 and then we get one 1 as change? but we have to have the 1 bill to give as change? No, the store gives the change. So we only use one bill (the 10) and the store gives us one 1? So we use 1 bill.\n\n          However, the problem counts the bills we use? Then the store's bills are not counted? \n\n          But the algorithm: \n            We count the bills we use to pay? And we are not responsible for the change? \n\n          The algorithm: \n            bills += 1 for the 10 we used? \n            and then we get 1 change? that doesn't count as a bill we use? \n\n          Then the algorithm should output 1 for 9? But we computed 2.\n\n          I see the algorithm: \n            It adds 10-9 = 1 (which is the change we get? and then we also count the 10 we used? but the 10 we used is represented by the carry to the next digit? and then the next digit is increased, and we will count that later? \n\n          How?\n\n            When we do:\n               bills += 10 - 9 = 1   -> this is the change we get? \n               and then we add one to the next digit -> that means we effectively borrowed a 10 from the next digit? so we have to pay one more 10? \n\n            Then at the next digit: we have 1 -> we pay that 10? by either one 10 bill? or ... but then we add 1 to the bills? \n\n            So total bills = 1 (from the change) + 1 (for the 10) = 2.\n\n          But that counts the change we receive as a bill? and the bill we use? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the problem is:\n\n            dp0 = 0   // no carry\n            dp1 = 1   // with carry (meaning we have an extra 10 at this digit)\n\n            Then for each digit d (from least to most):\n\n            without carry from next:\n                dp0_new = min( dp0 + d, dp1 + d+1 )   ? not exactly.\n\n          Alternatively, we can read the editorial. But the problem says we are to mimic the given Java program.\n\n          Since we are mimicking, we do as the Java program does: we computed 2 for 9.\n\n          And the sample in the problem: \n\n            Input: 36 -> Output: 8\n\n          How?\n\n            The Java program: \n                number = \"36\"\n                digits = [6,3] -> then extra digit at index2=0.\n\n                i=0: d=6 -> >5 -> bills += 10-6=4, carry to next: d[1] becomes 4 -> then bills=4.\n                i=1: d=4 -> <5 -> bills +=4 -> total=8.\n\n          But 36: \n            Option1: three 10 and six 1 -> 9\n            Option2: four 10 and get 4 change? then we use 4 bills (for the 40) and get 4 change? total bills=4? \n            Option3: use one 50 and get 14 change? that would be 1 (for the 50) and 14 ones? 15 bills? \n            Option4: use three 10 and one 5 and one 1? -> 3+1+1=5.\n\n          The minimum is 5? but we got 8.\n\n          I see: the algorithm is not the minimum? Or am I misunderstanding?\n\n          Actually, the problem atcoder_ABC155_E: \n            https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc155/tasks/abc155_e\n\n          The sample: \n            Input: 36 -> Output: 8\n\n          Why? The problem counts the total number of bills that change hands? including the change? \n\n          From the editorial: they count the bills we pay and the bills we receive as change? \n\n          So for 36: \n            We pay 40: 4 bills (of 10) -> then we get 4 change: 4 bills (of 1) -> total 8.\n\n          But we could do:\n            Pay 35: one 10, one 10, one 10, one 5 -> that's 4 bills, and then we pay 1 one -> 1 bill, total 5? and we don't get change? \n\n          However, the problem says: we have denominations: 1,10,100,... and 5,50,500,.... \n\n          How to pay 35? \n            We can use three 10 and one 5: that's 4 bills.\n\n          So why is the change method 40 and then 4 ones? \n\n          The algorithm is greedy from the least significant digit:\n\n            d0=6: \n                We can use 6 ones -> 6 bills.\n                Or we can use one 10 and get 4 change -> then we use 1 bill and get 4 bills as change -> total 5 bills? but the algorithm counts 10-6=4 (the change) and then adds one to the next digit? meaning we have to account for the 10 we used? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm:\n\n            We are trying to avoid having to use too many ones? \n\n            Step for the 6: \n                We choose to pay 10 and get 4 change -> then we have effectively increased the next digit by 1 (because we used one 10, which is 10^1, so we add 1 to the next digit) and we count the change (4 bills) -> 4.\n\n            Then the next digit becomes 3+1=4? \n                Then we pay 4 tens -> 4 bills.\n\n            Total bills = 4 (change) + 4 (tens) = 8.\n\n          Why not pay 5 and then 1? \n\n          The algorithm has a branch for 5: \n            if the next digit is >=5, then we do the same as overpaying? \n\n          How does it work for 5? \n\n            For 5: \n                Option1: pay 5 ones -> 5 bills.\n                Option2: pay 10 and get 5 change -> 5 bills? \n\n            But the algorithm: \n                if the next digit >=5, then we pay 10 and get 5 change? because then the next digit becomes one more? and if it is already high, we can reduce by carrying? \n\n          For 36: \n            d0=6 -> we pay 10 and get 4 change -> bills=4, and next digit becomes 4.\n            Then for d1=4: we pay 4 tens -> 4 bills, total=8.\n\n          Alternatively, if we had d0=5 and d1=3: \n            d0=5: \n                since d1=3 <5, we don't carry? so we pay 5 ones -> bills=5.\n            d1=3: pay 3 tens -> 3 bills, total=8.\n\n          But if we do for d0=5 and d1=6: \n            d0=5: d1=6>=5 -> then we do: carry to d1: d1 becomes 7, and bills=5.\n            Then d1=7: we pay 10 and get 3 change? -> bills=10-7=3? then carry to d2: d2 becomes 1? then d2: pay 1 -> 1 bill.\n            Total = 5+3+1 = 9? \n\n          Alternatively, we could for d0=5: pay 5 ones -> bills=5, then d1=6: pay 6 tens -> 6, total=11? \n\n          Or pay for d0=5: pay 10 and get 5 change: bills=5, then d1=6 becomes 7: then pay 7 tens? 7, total=12? \n\n          Or pay for d0=5: pay 5 ones? then for d1=6: pay one 50 and one 10? that would be 2 bills? total=5+2=7? \n\n          The algorithm seems to be not optimal? \n\n          But the known solution for the problem uses a DP.\n\n          However, we are to mimic the given Java program. So we do as it does.\n\n          Therefore, we output the Fortran program as described.\n\n        Let me test with the sample 36: \n          num = 36 -> then we extract digits: \n            L = 2\n            digits(0) = 6, digits(1)=3, digits(2)=0.\n\n          i=0: \n             6 -> greater than 5? -> bills += 10-6=4 -> then we add 1 to digits(1) -> digits(1)=4, bills=4.\n          i=1: \n             digits(1)=4 -> less than 5? -> bills +=4 -> total=8.\n          i=2: \n             digits(2)=0 -> bills +=0 -> total=8.\n\n          So output 8.\n\n          Therefore, the program is as below.\n\n        Note: the second program (divisors) is not computed? But as argued, it is not used by the third program. So we skip it.\n\n        We assume the input h and a are positive integers.\n\n        We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n        Edge: when a=0? \n          The first program: \n            for (h>0) ... then subtract a=0 -> infinite loop? \n          But the problem says \"behaves identically\". We assume the input a is at least 1? \n\n        Therefore, we do not handle a=0.\n\n        Final Fortran program:"
