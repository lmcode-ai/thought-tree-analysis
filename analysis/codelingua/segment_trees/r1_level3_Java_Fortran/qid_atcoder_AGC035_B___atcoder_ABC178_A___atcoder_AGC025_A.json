We want to match Java? \n\n             ! Actually, the original Java: \n             ! while (a>=10) -> false for negative, so it returns a.\n\n             ! So we can do:\n\n             if (a < 0) then\n                 digit_sum = a   ! because the loop doesn't run and then we add a.\n                 return\n             end if\n\n             n = a\n             s = 0\n             do while (n >= 10)\n                 s = s + mod(n,10)\n                 n = n / 10\n             end do\n             s = s + n\n             digit_sum = s\n          end function\n\n      end program\n\n  But wait: the digit_sum function for nonnegative numbers: For a=0: \n          n=0, while (n>=10) false, then s=0 -> returns 0. For a=10: \n          n=10 -> loop: \n               s=0+0, then n=10/10=1 -> then loop: 1>=10? false -> then s=0+1=1 -> returns 1. But the digit sum of 10 is 1. Correct. However, the original Java function for a=10:\n\n          ans=0\n          while (a>=10) -> true: ans += 10%10=0, a=10/10=1 -> then a<10 -> break, then ans+=1 -> 1. So it matches. But what about negative? We are handling negative by returning the number itself? But the original Java function for a=-1: returns -1. But in the third program, when N=0, we call digit_sum(N-1)=digit_sum(-1) -> -1. Then initial ans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0. Then the answer for N=0 is 0. For N=1: digit_sum(0)=0? because 0 is nonnegative: \n          n=0, while (0>=10) false -> returns 0. So for N=1: initial ans = 1+0=1. Therefore, we can write:\n\n      integer function digit_sum(a)\n        integer, intent(in) :: a\n        integer :: n, s\n        if (a < 0) then\n            digit_sum = a\n            return\n        end if\n        s = 0\n        n = a\n        do while (n >= 10)\n            s = s + mod(n,10)\n            n = n / 10\n        end do\n        s = s + n\n        digit_sum = s\n      end function\n\n  But note: in the original Java, the digit_sum for positive numbers is the sum of the digits. For negative, it returns the negative number? We are matching. However, the third program in the original was designed for N>=1? But in our chain, we call it with 0 or 1.\n\n  It works. But note: the third program might be called with N=0 and N=1, and we have defined it. Therefore, the complete Fortran program.",

Example: first_token=123, then we capture 123. Then the second program: \n        if (123==1) -> false -> then output 1. Then the third program: input=1 -> output=1. So the entire chain outputs 1. But the original chain:\n\n      The first program outputs \"123 ...\", the second program reads 123 and outputs 1, the third program outputs 1. So it matches. Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly. Note: We are using a derived type for the graph. This is Fortran 2003. Let's write the code. Due to the complexity, we must be cautious. We assume the input nodes are 1-indexed and we use 1-indexed throughout. Steps for the graph:\n\n      We read numNode, numEdge. If numEdge is even, then we read the edges and build the graph. We then run the DFS. We'll assume the maximum numNode is 200000, so we use dynamic allocation. We'll write the entire program. However, note: the DFS is recursive. We might run into recursion depth? But the graph is not necessarily a tree. We can change to iterative DFS? But the original is recursive. We'll assume the stack can handle the recursion. But Fortran usually has limited stack size. We can change to iterative DFS? Given time, we do iterative DFS. How to convert the recursive DFS to iterative? We use a stack. We store (crt, parent, index) where index is the next neighbor index to visit.",

(we just finished it) -> then we do the post processing: \n                 if odd(child) then \n                    output (child, parent) and flip odd(child)\n                 else\n                    output (parent, child) and flip odd(parent) But we are not storing the entire output, only the first token. So we do:\n\n             if (odd(child)) then\n                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                     first_token = child\n                     token_captured = .true. end if\n                 odd(child) = .not. odd(child)\n             else\n                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                     first_token = parent\n                     token_captured = .true.\n                 end if\n                 odd(parent) = .not.",

When we see a back edge to a finished node (visited(child)==2) -> then we update. 2. When we finish a child node (in the popping of the child) -> then we update. But what about a back edge to an in-progress node (visited(child)==1)? In the recursive version, we skip: if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) -> continue\n\n          In our iterative, we do the same: \n                 if (visited(child)==1) then \n                     cycle   [we skip]\n\n          And for visited(child)==2, we do the back edge action. Also, when we push a child, we don't do anything else. This matches.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_AGC035_B) reads an undirected graph and checks if the number of edges is even. If not, it outputs -1 and exits.\n    Then it does a DFS to output edges in such a way that every vertex has even degree in the output.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) reads an integer and outputs 1 if the integer is 0? Actually, it reads an integer `x` and outputs 1 if `x==0`? \n    Let me check: \n        int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n        boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n        int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n    So if x==1, then bool is true, then result = 0; if x !=1, then bool false, then result=1.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_AGC025_A) reads an integer N and computes the minimum sum of the digit sums of two numbers A and B such that A+B=N.\n\n However, note the instruction: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n So the chain is:\n   Input for the first program -> Output of first program becomes input of second -> Output of second becomes input of third -> Output of third is the final output.\n\n But note: the first program outputs either -1 (if numEdge is odd) or a list of edges (each edge on a line as two numbers).\n The second program expects a single integer.\n\n This chain does not seem to make sense because the output of the first program is either:\n   - \"-1\" (a string) or \n   - a multiline string of edges.\n\n The second program expects a single integer.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider the problem: the entire sequence of programs is executed on the same original input?\n Or is the output of one program the input of the next? The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the first program's output is not a single integer that the second program can read. Similarly, the second program outputs 0 or 1, which is then fed to the third program that expects an integer N (which would be 0 or 1) and then computes the minimum digit sum for splitting 0 or 1.\n\n This does not seem to be a meaningful chain.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n However, the three Java programs are independent and do not form a meaningful chain.\n\n There might be a misunderstanding: the problem says we are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. But the example provided is three separate programs that are not designed to be chained.\n\n Since the problem does not specify how the output of one is transformed to the input of the next, and the outputs are of different formats, I suspect that the intended chain is not as arbitrary as it seems.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we are to simulate the entire chain as if the output of the first program is passed as input to the second, and then the output of the second to the third, but without intermediate I/O.\n\n How to handle:\n\n  For the first program (atcoder_AGC035_B):\n      Input: two integers (numNode, numEdge) and then numEdge edges (each edge is two integers, 1-indexed).\n      Output: \n          If numEdge is odd: the string \"-1\" (and then the program exits).\n          Else: a sequence of edges (each edge is two integers, one per line) in a specific order.\n\n  Then the second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer. But note: the output of the first program is either:\n      Option 1: \"-1\" (a string of length 2 including newline? Actually, it prints -1 and then a newline? The program uses System.out.println(-1) -> prints \"-1\\n\")\n      Option 2: multiple lines of edges (each edge is printed as \"a b\\n\")\n\n  The second program reads one integer. How does it interpret the output of the first?\n      If the first program outputs \"-1\\n\", then the second program would read -1? But the second program's logic: \n          if x==1 then output 0, else output 1.\n      So if x is -1, then output 1.\n\n  Then the third program would get 1 as input? Then it would compute:\n        n = (1+1)/2 = 1 (if odd) -> but 1 is odd? Actually: \n        N=1 -> n = (1+1)/2 = 1? (but note: the third program: if N%2==0 then n=N/2, else n=(N+1)/2 -> for 1: n=1)\n        Then loop A from 1 to 1: \n            sum(A)=sum(1)=1, sum(N-A)=sum(0)=0 -> total=1.\n        Then it outputs 1.\n\n  But the original first program might output a list of edges? Then the second program would try to read an integer from the first line of that output? \n      The second program uses `scan.next()` which reads the next token. The first token of the first program's output (if not -1) would be the first number of the first edge.\n\n  However, the chain of programs is fixed: the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third.\n\n  But the first program's output has multiple tokens? The second program only reads one token. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program will only read the first token.\n\n  Then the third program will read the integer output by the second.\n\n  So the entire chain:\n\n      Original input to the first program: (numNode, numEdge, edges)\n\n      Step 1: \n          If numEdge is odd -> output \"-1\"\n          Else: output a list of edges (each edge is two integers, one per line). The first token of the first line is the first number of the first edge.\n\n      Step 2: \n          The second program reads the first token of the first program's output. If that token is \"-1\", then it outputs 1. \n          Otherwise, it tries to parse that token as an integer (say `x`). Then it outputs 0 if `x==1` else 1.\n\n      Step 3:\n          The third program reads the output of the second (which is either 0 or 1) and then computes the answer as described.\n\n  However, note that the second program only reads one token. So if the first program outputs a list of edges, the second program will take the first integer from the first edge. For example, if the first edge output is \"1 2\", then the second program reads 1 -> then outputs 0.\n\n  Then the third program gets 0 as input? \n        For N=0: \n            if N%2==0 -> true, so n=0/2=0 -> then the loop runs from A=1 to 0 -> doesn't run. \n            initial ans = sum(1) + sum(-1) -> wait, N-1 = -1? \n\n  This leads to an issue: the third program expects a positive integer? But in the original, the input N is positive? The problem says the same input? \n\n  But the chain: the input to the entire system is the graph? and then the output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and so on.\n\n  How to resolve?\n\n  After reading the problem statement again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  However, the three programs are from different problems and are not designed to work together. \n\n  Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the entire sequence is run on the same original input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same input? But that doesn't make sense because the input formats are different.\n\n  The first program expects: \n        numNode numEdge\n        then edges\n\n  The second program expects one integer.\n\n  The third program expects one integer.\n\n  How can they run on the same input?\n\n  There is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n  So the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program. The output of the first program is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third. The output of the third is the final output.\n\n  Therefore, we have to design the Fortran program as:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program (numNode, numEdge, and the edges).\n      Step 2: Run the logic of the first program. But instead of printing, we capture the output as a string? But then the second program needs to read from that string? \n\n  However, the problem says: without intermediate I/O. So we have to simulate the chain without actually writing and reading from files or pipes.\n\n  But note: the second program only reads one integer. So we don't need the entire output of the first program? Only the first token? \n\n  How about:\n\n      We run the first program until it would produce output. Then we extract the first token of that output and use it as the input to the second program.\n\n      Then we run the second program on that integer.\n\n      Then we run the third program on the output of the second.\n\n  But the first program produces either:\n        (a) \"-1\" (so the token is the string \"-1\")\n        (b) a list of edges. The first token of the first edge (which is an integer) is the first token.\n\n  So for the second program, we only need the first token of the first program's output.\n\n  However, the first program's output is either:\n        Option (a): a single token: \"-1\"\n        Option (b): multiple tokens, but the first token is the first integer of the first edge.\n\n  How to capture that token without generating the entire output? \n\n  Actually, we don't need to generate the entire list of edges if we are only going to use the first token? \n\n  But note: the first program does a DFS and builds a string of edges. We cannot avoid running the DFS because the first token might be the first number of the first edge, which depends on the DFS order.\n\n  However, we can run the first program until we know the first token? \n\n  But the DFS might not output the edges in the order we expect? \n\n  Alternatively, we run the entire first program and capture the entire output? But the problem says without intermediate I/O. We can store the output of the first program in memory? But the problem says \"without I/O\", meaning we don't do read/write to external files, but we can store in memory.\n\n  Then the Fortran program structure:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program (numNode, numEdge, edges)\n      Step 2: \n          If numEdge is odd -> set a string variable to \"-1\" (and we know the first token is -1)\n          Else: run the DFS and build the entire output string. Then extract the first token (the first integer) from the first line.\n\n      Step 3: Use that token (converted to integer) as input to the second program. The second program does:\n          x = token (which is an integer)\n          result = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1\n\n      Step 4: Take the result (which is an integer) and use it as input to the third program.\n\n      Step 5: The third program computes the answer for the integer from step 4.\n\n      Step 6: Output the result of the third program.\n\n  But note: the original first program, when it outputs -1, then the entire chain should output the result of the third program when given the second program's output for input -1? \n        Second program: input -1 -> then x==1? false -> result=1.\n        Third program: input=1 -> then output 1.\n\n  However, the original first program outputs -1 and exits. So the entire chain should output 1? But the original first program outputs -1 and that should be the final output? \n\n  The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". But the chain is defined as the output of the last program. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program runs and outputs 1, then the third runs and outputs 1. The final output is 1.\n\n  But the original first program would have printed -1 and then exited. The rest of the chain would not run? Actually, in the chain, the first program outputs -1, then the second program runs and reads -1, then outputs 1, then the third runs and outputs 1.\n\n  So the final output is 1, which is different from the first program's output.\n\n  This is a problem. The chain is defined by the programs: the first program outputs -1 and then the second and third run? \n\n  The problem says \"the entire sequence\". So we have to run all three programs? \n\n  But the first program, when it prints -1, it exits. So the rest of the chain is run with input -1? \n\n  How about we change the design:\n\n      We run the first program until it would output. If it outputs -1, then we skip the rest of the chain and output -1? \n      But the problem says the entire sequence. So we must run all three? \n\n  The problem does not specify. \n\n  However, note that the first program, when it outputs -1, it does so and then returns (exits). The next programs would run on that output. \n\n  So the chain is:\n\n      Program1: outputs \"-1\\n\"\n      Program2: reads the token \"-1\" -> which becomes the integer -1 -> then outputs \"1\\n\"\n      Program3: reads 1 -> outputs the result for N=1, which is 1.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n  But the original first program would have output -1 and that would be the end? However, the problem says the entire sequence. So we have to simulate the chain.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might expect that if the first program outputs -1, then we break the chain and output -1? But the problem says the entire sequence.\n\n  I think we must follow the chain: the output of the first program is the input to the second, regardless of what it is.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n\n      Step 2: Check if numEdge is odd -> then set a variable `first_output` to the string \"-1\" (we don't need to run DFS). \n               Otherwise, run the DFS and set `first_output` to the entire string of edges.\n\n      Step 3: From `first_output`, extract the first token (which we assume is the first integer until whitespace). Convert that to an integer. This integer is the input for the second program.\n\n      Step 4: Run the second program with that integer: \n               if the integer is 1, then set `second_output` to 0; else set to 1.\n\n      Step 5: Run the third program with `second_output` as the input N.\n\n      Step 6: Print the result of the third program.\n\n  But note: what if the first program outputs multiple edges? The first token might be the first node index. For example, if the first edge output is \"1 2\", then the first token is 1.\n\n  This matches the above.\n\n  However, what if the first program outputs an edge that starts with a negative number? It doesn't because the nodes are 1-indexed and positive.\n\n  But note: the first program adds 1 to the node index (because it subtracted 1 when reading, then adds 1 when printing). So the nodes are at least 1.\n\n  So the first token is always a positive integer? unless it outputs \"-1\", which is negative.\n\n  Therefore, we can do.\n\n  Implementation in Fortran:\n\n      We must read the first input: numNode, numEdge, and then numEdge edges.\n\n      Then:\n          if (numEdge % 2 /= 0) then\n             token1 = -1   ! because the first token of the output is \"-1\"\n          else\n             ! Run the DFS to build the entire output string? But we only need the first token? \n             ! However, the DFS might be necessary to determine the first edge? \n             ! But note: the DFS starts at node 0 (which becomes 1 when printed) and the first edge it outputs might be from 1 to another node? \n             ! How does the DFS work? \n             !   We start at node 0 (index0). \n             !   We mark it visited=1.\n             !   Then we iterate over its children. \n             !   The first child that is not parent and not visited? \n             !   The order depends on the order of the children in the list.\n\n             We don't know the first edge without running the DFS? \n\n             However, we don't need the entire output string? We only need the first token (the first number of the first edge). \n\n             How about we run the DFS until we output the first edge? Then we break? \n\n             But the DFS is recursive and we need the state of the entire graph to compute the odd[] array? \n\n             Alternatively, we run the entire DFS and then take the first token? \n\n             But the DFS might be heavy? But the constraints? The original problem constraints? The problem does not specify, so we assume the graph is not too big.\n\n             We'll run the entire DFS and store the output string? But the problem says without intermediate I/O, meaning we don't print to screen or read from file. We can store the output in a string variable? But the output can be large? \n\n             We only need the first token. How about during the DFS, when we output the first edge, we record the first number? Then we can stop storing the rest? But the DFS must run to update the odd[] array and visited[] for the entire graph? \n\n             Actually, the DFS must run completely because the output of an edge later depends on the state of the nodes updated by the DFS of the children.\n\n             Therefore, we must run the entire DFS. But we don't need to store the entire output? We only need the first token? \n\n             How about: we modify the DFS to record the first token? But the DFS outputs edges in multiple places:\n\n                1. When it encounters a back edge (visited[child]==2) -> then it outputs an edge (crt, child) and updates odd[crt].\n                2. When returning from a child that was visited and not having odd[child] set, it outputs an edge from crt to child? \n\n             And if the child had odd[child] set, it outputs the reverse.\n\n             We cannot predict the first edge without running the DFS.\n\n             Therefore, we will run the entire DFS and record the entire output? But the problem says without intermediate I/O, but we are allowed to store in memory? \n\n             Alternatively, we can store the entire output in a string? But Fortran strings are fixed length? We can use a character array? \n\n             However, the problem does not specify the size. We can assume maximum number of edges is 200000? Then each edge has two numbers (each up to 200000, so 6 digits) and a space and a newline -> 13 characters per edge? Then total characters: 200000*13 = 2.6e6 -> acceptable.\n\n             But we only need the first token? Why store the entire output? Because the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and we are going to pass only the first token to the next program? \n\n             Actually, the next program (second) only needs the first token. The rest of the output of the first program is not used.\n\n             So we can run the entire DFS, but only record the first token (the first integer) that is printed? \n\n             How to do: we can set a flag to capture the first token. We break after the first token? But the DFS must run to completion to update the state? \n\n             Actually, the DFS must run to completion to update the odd[] array and the visited array? Because the output of subsequent edges depends on the state. But we don't care about the rest of the output? \n\n             However, the DFS does not break after the first edge. It continues. But we only care about the first token? \n\n             We can simulate the DFS and when we are about to append the first edge, we note the first integer. Then we don't store the rest? \n\n             But the DFS uses a StringBuilder in Java. In Fortran, we can avoid building the entire string? \n\n             We'll do:\n\n                We run the DFS, and when we would append an edge, if we haven't captured the first token, then we extract the first integer of that edge and store it. Then we ignore the rest? \n\n             But the DFS has side effects: it updates the odd[] array and visited array. So we must run the entire DFS, but we don't need to build the entire output string? We only need the first token. \n\n             Therefore, we can modify the DFS to not build the string, but to capture the first token? \n\n             How about:\n\n                 We remove the StringBuilder and instead, when we would append an edge, we do:\n\n                    if (first_token_not_captured) then\n                        first_token = the first integer of the edge (which is either crt+1 or child+1, depending on the branch)\n                        set captured = .true.\n                    end if\n\n                 But note: the DFS appends multiple edges. We only want the first one? \n\n                 However, the order of appending is the order of the DFS. The first time we append an edge, that is the first token.\n\n             But the DFS may output an edge for a back edge before going deeper? \n\n             Example:\n\n                 Start at node0. \n                 It sees a node that is visited==2 -> then it outputs an edge (0, that node) -> that is the first edge.\n\n                 Or if it doesn't see any back edge, then it goes to a child. Then when returning from the child, it may output an edge? \n\n             So we must capture the first time we output an edge.\n\n             We can do:\n\n                 We add a logical flag: first_token_captured = .false.\n                 We add an integer variable: first_token\n\n                 In the DFS, when we are about to output an edge, we check if first_token_captured is false. Then we set:\n\n                     In the branch for back edge: \n                         first_token = crt+1   (if we are outputting \"crt+1 child+1\")\n                     In the branch for returning from child: \n                         if we output (child+1, crt+1) then first_token = child+1\n                         if we output (crt+1, child+1) then first_token = crt+1\n\n                 Then set first_token_captured = .true.\n\n                 We do not break; we continue the DFS because the state updates are important.\n\n             But note: the DFS might update the state (odd[] array) and that affects subsequent edges. So we must run the entire DFS.\n\n             Therefore, we can run the DFS without building the string, but capturing the first token? \n\n             However, the original DFS builds the entire output. We are changing the behavior? But we don't use the entire output. We only use the first token.\n\n             This is acceptable.\n\n      Step 4: Then we have the first_token (an integer) from the first program.\n\n      Step 5: Then we run the second program: \n                 if (first_token == 1) then\n                     second_output = 0\n                 else\n                     second_output = 1\n                 end if\n\n      Step 6: Then we run the third program with N = second_output.\n\n      Step 7: The third program computes the minimum digit sum for splitting N (which is either 0 or 1) into two nonnegative integers A and B such that A+B=N.\n\n             For N=0: \n                 A can be 0, B=0 -> digit_sum(0)+digit_sum(0)=0+0=0.\n                 But note: the third program's function `sum` for 0: \n                     while (a>=10) -> false, then adds a -> 0.\n                 So digit_sum(0)=0.\n\n                 Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n             For N=1:\n                 The program sets: \n                     if N%2==0 -> false, so n=(1+1)/2=1.\n                 Then initial ans = sum(1)+sum(0) = 1+0=1.\n                 Then loop A from 1 to 1:\n                     A=1: then B=0 -> sum(1)+sum(0)=1 -> which is not less than 1? so no update.\n                 Then output 1.\n\n      Step 8: Print the result.\n\n  But wait: what if the first program outputs -1? Then we set first_token = -1 (as integer). Then the second program: \n        if first_token==1 -> false -> so second_output=1.\n        Then the third program: N=1 -> output 1.\n\n  However, the original first program would have output -1, but the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n  But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must output the result of the third program? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The entire chain of three programs outputs 1 in the case of odd numEdge? \n\n  But the first program by itself would output -1. The chain outputs 1.\n\n  This is the behavior of the chain.\n\n  Therefore, we design:\n\n      Read numNode, numEdge, and the edges.\n\n      if (mod(numEdge,2) /= 0) then\n          first_token = -1\n      else\n          ! Allocate arrays: connect, visited, odd\n          ! Build the graph: connect is an array of lists (we can use a 2D array? or an array of arrays? Fortran: we can use an array of linked lists? or we can use an adjacency matrix? but the graph can be large.\n\n          We'll use an allocatable array of arrays? But Fortran doesn't have dynamic lists. We can use:\n\n             type :: node\n                 integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n                 integer :: count = 0\n             end type\n\n          But we know the maximum degree? We can preallocate for each node an array of size (max_degree) or we can use a 2D array? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use an array of pointers to arrays? That is complex.\n\n          We can use a single array for all neighbors and an array of pointers (like CSR). But that is heavy.\n\n          Instead, we can use a 2D array `graph` of size (numNode, max_degree) and an array `degree` of length numNode.\n\n          Steps:\n\n             allocate(degree(numNode), graph(numNode, max_degree))   ! but max_degree? we don't know. We can set max_degree to numNode? worst-case.\n\n          But the problem does not specify constraints. We assume numNode is up to 10000? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a jagged array by having a 1D array for neighbors and an array of start indices? \n\n          But for simplicity, we'll assume we can use an array of fixed size for each node? \n\n          However, Fortran 95+ supports allocatable arrays in derived types.\n\n          We can do:\n\n             type NodeType\n                 integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n             end type\n             type(NodeType), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\n          Steps:\n\n             allocate(connect(numNode))\n             do i=1, numNode\n                 ! initially empty, but we will add neighbors as we read edges.\n             end do\n\n          But we are reading the edges: each edge (a,b) -> we add b to connect(a) and a to connect(b).\n\n          How to add? We can use:\n\n             temp = [connect(a)%neighbors, b]   ! but that is inefficient.\n\n          Alternatively, we can read all edges and count the degree for each node? Then allocate each connect(i) to the degree, and then fill.\n\n          We do:\n\n             allocate(degree(numNode))\n             degree = 0\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 read a, b   ! both 1-indexed? but the first program subtracts 1 -> so we store as 0-indexed? \n                 Actually, in the first program: \n                    a = sc.nextInt()-1\n                    b = sc.nextInt()-1\n                 So we will store in 0-indexed internally.\n\n                 Then: \n                    degree(a+1) = degree(a+1)+1   -> but wait: we are in Fortran and using 1-indexed for arrays? \n                 We are storing the graph: we can use 1-indexed for nodes? \n\n                 Let me decide: we use 1-indexed for the arrays? \n\n                 Input: the user gives 1-indexed node indices.\n\n                 We subtract 1 to make 0-indexed? But the first program does that. Then it stores in an array of lists.\n\n                 In Fortran, we can do:\n\n                    read the two integers: a, b   (these are 1-indexed)\n\n                 Then we store:\n\n                    node1 = a, node2 = b.\n\n                 We do not subtract? But the DFS uses 0-indexed in the first program. \n\n                 How about we store the graph in 1-indexed? \n\n                 The DFS in the first program uses the array `connect` of size numNode, and the nodes are 0-indexed. \n\n                 We can store:\n\n                    connect(i) for i=0..numNode-1? But Fortran arrays are 1-indexed by default.\n\n                 We can define:\n\n                    type(NodeType), allocatable :: connect(:)\n                    allocate(connect(numNode))   ! indices 1 to numNode.\n\n                 And then when we read an edge (a,b) (as 1-indexed from input), we do:\n\n                    i = a\n                    j = b\n\n                 Then we add j to connect(i)%neighbors and i to connect(j)%neighbors.\n\n          How to add? We can do:\n\n             integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n             do i_edge = 1, numEdge\n                 read*, a, b\n                 ! For node a\n                 if (.not.allocated(connect(a)%neighbors)) then\n                     allocate(connect(a)%neighbors(1))\n                     connect(a)%neighbors(1) = b\n                 else\n                     ! append b to the list\n                     old_size = size(connect(a)%neighbors)\n                     allocate(temp(old_size+1))\n                     temp(1:old_size) = connect(a)%neighbors\n                     temp(old_size+1) = b\n                     deallocate(connect(a)%neighbors)\n                     call move_alloc(temp, connect(a)%neighbors)\n                 endif\n                 ! similarly for b\n                 ... same for node b: append a\n\n          But note: the graph is undirected.\n\n          However, this is inefficient. We can precompute the degrees and then fill? \n\n          We can do:\n\n             ! First, count the degree of each node\n             allocate(degree(numNode))\n             degree = 0\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 read*, a, b\n                 degree(a) = degree(a) + 1\n                 degree(b) = degree(b) + 1\n             end do\n\n             ! Then allocate each connect(i)%neighbors to size degree(i)\n             do i=1, numNode\n                 allocate(connect(i)%neighbors(degree(i)))\n                 ! and reset a counter for each node\n                 degree(i) = 0   ! now we use it as a counter\n             end do\n\n             ! Then rewind the input? But we don't have the edges stored. We have to read again? \n\n          Alternatively, we can read the edges and store them in a temporary array? \n\n          How about we read the edges into an array `edges(2, numEdge)`? \n\n          Steps:\n\n             integer, allocatable :: edges(:,:)\n             allocate(edges(2, numEdge))\n\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 read*, edges(1, i), edges(2, i)\n             end do\n\n             then count the degrees:\n\n                 degree(edges(1,i)) = degree(edges(1,i)) + 1\n                 degree(edges(2,i)) = degree(edges(2,i)) + 1\n\n             then allocate the neighbors arrays, then fill.\n\n          But we need to read the input only once? \n\n          We can do:\n\n             read numNode, numEdge\n             allocate(edges(2, numEdge))\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 read*, edges(1,i), edges(2,i)\n             end do\n\n             allocate(degree(numNode))\n             degree = 0\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 a = edges(1,i)\n                 b = edges(2,i)\n                 degree(a) = degree(a)+1\n                 degree(b) = degree(b)+1\n             end do\n\n             allocate(connect(numNode))\n             do i=1, numNode\n                 allocate(connect(i)%neighbors(degree(i)))\n                 ! and set a counter for filling\n                 degree(i) = 0   ! reuse as counter\n             end do\n\n             do i=1, numEdge\n                 a = edges(1,i)\n                 b = edges(2,i)\n                 ! add b to a's list\n                 degree(a) = degree(a)+1\n                 connect(a)%neighbors(degree(a)) = b\n                 ! add a to b's list\n                 degree(b) = degree(b)+1\n                 connect(b)%neighbors(degree(b)) = a\n             end do\n\n          Then we have the graph.\n\n      Then we run the DFS. We need:\n\n          visited: array of integers (0: not visited, 1: in progress, 2: finished) -> we can use 0,1,2.\n          odd: array of booleans for each node.\n\n      We also need to capture the first token. We'll have:\n\n          integer :: first_token\n          logical :: token_captured = .false.\n\n      Then we write the DFS subroutine. The DFS in the first program:\n\n          procedure dfs(crt, parent)\n             visited(crt) = 1\n             for each child in connect[crt]:\n                 if child == parent: continue\n                 if visited[child] == 1: continue? Actually, the first program does:\n                    if child==parent or visited[child]==1 -> continue? \n                 but note: the first program checks:\n                    if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) -> continue\n                    else if (visited[child]==2) -> then output edge (crt, child) and flip odd[crt]\n                    else -> then recursively call dfs(child, crt)\n                         then if odd[child] is true: output (child, crt) and flip odd[child]\n                         else: output (crt, child) and flip odd[crt]\n\n          We need to simulate that.\n\n          We will not output the edge to a string, but when we would output an edge (either (crt, child) or (child, crt)), we check if token_captured is false. Then:\n\n             For the edge (x,y) that we are about to output, we set first_token = x (the first node in the edge) and set token_captured = .true.\n\n          Then we do the flip of the odd array as required.\n\n      After the DFS, we have the first_token.\n\n      Then we proceed to the second program.\n\n  However, note: the DFS in the first program uses the global StringBuilder. We are not storing the entire output, so we skip the string building. But the state (odd and visited) must be updated exactly as in the first program.\n\n  We do not need the entire output, only the first token. So we can do:\n\n      Instead of building the string, when we would output an edge (say from u to v) we do:\n\n          if (.not.token_captured) then\n              first_token = u   ! because the edge is printed as u followed by v\n              token_captured = .true.\n          end if\n\n          Then update the odd array: \n             if the edge is (u, v) then flip odd[u] (if u is the crt in the back edge branch, then we flip odd[crt] -> which is u)\n             if the edge is (v, u) then flip odd[v]? \n\n          But note: the DFS has two branches:\n\n            Branch 1 (back edge): \n                we output (crt, child) -> so u = crt, v = child.\n                then we flip odd[crt] -> so odd[u] is flipped.\n\n            Branch 2 (from recursion): \n                if odd[child] is true: we output (child, crt) -> so u = child, v = crt -> then we flip odd[child] (which is u) -> then set odd[child]=false.\n                else: we output (crt, child) -> then flip odd[crt] (which is u) -> then set odd[crt]=not odd[crt].\n\n          So in both cases, we flip the node that is the first node in the output edge.\n\n          And we capture that first node as the first_token.\n\n      Then we run the entire DFS.\n\n  But note: what if the DFS does not output any edge? That should not happen because we have an even number of edges and the DFS should output all edges? \n\n  Therefore, we will capture the first edge.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      We'll have:\n\n         integer, parameter :: NOT_VISITED=0, IN_PROGRESS=1, DONE=2\n         integer :: visited(numNode)   ! initialized to NOT_VISITED\n         logical :: odd(numNode)       ! initialized to .false.\n\n         first_token = 0   ! default, but we will set in the DFS.\n         token_captured = .false.\n\n         call dfs(1, -1)   ! starting at node 1 (if we use 1-indexed) and parent=-1 (meaning no parent). But note: in the first program, nodes are 0-indexed and they start at 0. We are using 1-indexed, so we start at 1.\n\n         However, the graph nodes in Fortran are 1-indexed? \n\n         But the input: the user gives 1-indexed, and we stored the graph in 1-indexed. \n\n         So the DFS should start at node 1? \n\n         But the first program starts at node0 -> which is the first node. So we start at node1.\n\n  Important: the first program uses 0-indexed, but we stored the graph in 1-indexed without subtracting 1? \n\n      When we read the input: a and b (1-indexed from the user) -> we stored them as is. \n\n      Then the graph: node a has neighbor b, and node b has neighbor a.\n\n      Then the DFS: \n\n          We start at node1.\n\n          The parent of node1 is -1 (which we can represent as 0? but we don't have node0). \n\n          We must adjust: we use an integer parent, and when parent is 0, it means none? \n\n          But our nodes are 1..numNode. So we can use parent=0 to indicate none.\n\n  Then:\n\n      subroutine dfs(crt, parent)\n        integer, intent(in) :: crt, parent\n        integer :: i, child\n        visited(crt) = IN_PROGRESS   ! =1\n        do i=1, size(connect(crt)%neighbors)\n            child = connect(crt)%neighbors(i)\n            if (child == parent) cycle\n            if (visited(child) == IN_PROGRESS) cycle\n            if (visited(child) == DONE) then\n                ! This is a back edge? \n                ! We output edge: (crt, child)\n                if (.not.token_captured) then\n                    first_token = crt\n                    token_captured = .true.\n                end if\n                odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)   ! flip\n            else\n                call dfs(child, crt)\n                if (odd(child)) then\n                    ! output (child, crt)\n                    if (.not.token_captured) then\n                        first_token = child\n                        token_captured = .true.\n                    end if\n                    odd(child) = .not. odd(child)\n                else\n                    ! output (crt, child)\n                    if (.not.token_captured) then\n                        first_token = crt\n                        token_captured = .true.\n                    end if\n                    odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n        visited(crt) = DONE   ! =2\n      end subroutine\n\n  But note: the DFS in the first program cycles through the neighbors in the order of the ArrayList. In our Fortran, we are looping in the order of the array we stored. \n\n  However, the order of neighbors might be different? But we stored the edges in the order of input? \n\n  But the first program does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n            int a = ...; int b = ...;\n            connect[a].add(b);\n            connect[b].add(a);\n        }\n\n  So the neighbors for a node are stored in the order of the edges that include that node? \n\n  In our Fortran, we stored the neighbors in the order of the input edges? But for a given node, the neighbors might appear multiple times? No, we add each edge once per node.\n\n  And we add the neighbor when we see the edge. \n\n  But note: we stored the entire list of neighbors by scanning all edges and adding each occurrence. The order is the order of the edges that include the node? \n\n  Actually, in our filling step:\n\n      do i=1, numEdge\n          a = edges(1,i)\n          b = edges(2,i)\n          ! add b to a's list at position degree(a) (which is the next free slot)\n          degree(a) = degree(a)+1\n          connect(a)%neighbors(degree(a)) = b\n          ! similarly for b\n      end do\n\n  So the neighbors for node a are stored in the order of the edges that have node a as the first node? and then the edges that have node a as the second node? \n\n  Actually, we are iterating over the edges in the input order. For a given node, we add:\n\n      When the edge is (a, b): we add b to a's list at the time we see the edge.\n\n      When the edge is (b, a) in a later edge? then we add a to b's list at that time.\n\n  But for the list for node a: we add:\n\n      for each edge (a, x) that appears in the input? Actually, when we see an edge (a, b) we add b to a's list.\n\n      and when we see an edge (b, a) we add a to b's list.\n\n  So for node a, the neighbors are added in the order of the edges that have a as the first node and then the edges that have a as the second node? \n\n  But we are iterating the edges only once. For an edge (a,b), we add:\n\n        to a's list: b\n        to b's list: a\n\n  So for node a, the neighbors are added in the order of the edges that have a as the first node? and then the edges that have a as the second node? \n\n  Actually, no: if the input edge is (x,y) and a is x, then we add y to a's list at that edge.\n\n  But if the input edge is (y,a) then we add y to a's list? \n\n  The order for node a: the neighbors are added in the order of the edges that mention node a, and in the position of the edge in the input.\n\n  This is the same as the first program? \n\n  The first program:\n\n      for each edge: it adds b to a and a to b.\n\n  And the ArrayList for a node a: the neighbors are added in the order of the edges that mention a.\n\n  So it is the same? \n\n  Therefore, the DFS order should be the same.\n\n  After the DFS, we have first_token.\n\n  Then:\n\n      if (mod(numEdge,2)/=0) then\n          first_token = -1\n      else\n          ! we ran the DFS and set first_token and token_captured\n          ! if the graph has no edges? then token_captured might be false? \n          ! But if numEdge is even and nonzero, then we should capture. If numEdge=0, then the DFS would not output any edge? \n          ! Then we have a problem: what is the first_token? \n\n          But the first program: if numEdge=0, then the DFS runs and doesn't output any edge? Then the output would be empty? \n\n          Then the second program would read an empty token? -> but in Java, Scanner would throw an exception? \n\n          In our Fortran, we need to handle: \n\n             if (numEdge==0) then \n                 ! the first program outputs nothing? \n                 ! then the second program would read nothing? \n\n          How about: if the first program outputs nothing, then we set first_token to 0? \n\n          But the problem: the first program only outputs edges. If there are no edges, then no output.\n\n          The second program would then try to read and fail? \n\n          We assume there is at least one edge if numEdge is even and positive? \n\n          But numEdge=0 is even. \n\n          We need to capture: if the DFS did not capture any token (i.e., token_captured remains false), then we set first_token = 0? \n\n          But the second program: if it reads nothing, what would it do? \n\n          Since the problem does not specify, and the original chain might crash, we try to avoid.\n\n          However, note: the DFS in the first program for an empty graph:\n\n             Start at node0 (node1 in our 1-indexed). \n             It marks it visited=1.\n             It has no neighbors -> then sets visited=2 and returns.\n\n             Then no output.\n\n          So the first program outputs nothing.\n\n          The second program: \n\n             Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n             int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n\n          This would throw an exception because there is no token.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid. But the problem says the same behavior.\n\n          We'll assume the input graphs are such that if numEdge is even and positive, then there is at least one edge? \n\n          Or note: the DFS only outputs an edge when it encounters a back edge or after recursion. For a graph with no edges, the DFS does nothing.\n\n          But the problem does not specify constraints. \n\n          How about we set: if numEdge==0, then we set first_token = 0? \n\n          Then the second program: input 0 -> then output 1.\n\n          Then the third program: input 1 -> output 1.\n\n          That might be acceptable.\n\n          Alternatively, if the DFS does not capture any token, then we set first_token = 0.\n\n      So in the else branch (after DFS):\n\n          if (token_captured) then \n              ! we have first_token\n          else\n              first_token = 0\n          end if\n\n  Then we proceed.\n\n  Summary of the Fortran program:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n\n          ! ... declare variables ...\n\n          !

But in our chain, N can be 0 or 1.\n\n             ! For N=0: \n             !   The original third program would compute:\n             !        initial ans = sum(1) + sum(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n             !   Then loop A from 1 to 0: doesn't run. \n             !

We write a function for digit_sum that works for any integer? But the original does.\n\n             ans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1)\n\n             do A=1, n\n                 temp = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n                 if (temp < ans) then\n                     ans = temp\n                 end if\n             end do\n\n          end subroutine\n\n          integer function digit_sum(a)\n             integer, intent(in) :: a\n             integer :: n, s\n             s = 0\n             n = a\n             ! We handle negative: the original Java function: for negative, it will add negative digits?\n             ! Example: a=-1: \n             !   n = -1\n             !   while (n>=10) -> false\n             !   then s += n -> -1.\n             ! That matches.\n\n             ! But the modulus for negative: in Java, -1 % 10 is -1? \n             ! In Fortran, the modulus for negative: \n             !   mod(-1,10) is 9? or -1? \n             !   We want to match Java? \n\n             ! Actually, the original Java: \n             !   while (a>=10) -> false for negative, so it returns a.\n\n             ! So we can do:\n\n             if (a < 0) then\n                 digit_sum = a   ! because the loop doesn't run and then we add a.\n                 return\n             end if\n\n             n = a\n             s = 0\n             do while (n >= 10)\n                 s = s + mod(n,10)\n                 n = n / 10\n             end do\n             s = s + n\n             digit_sum = s\n          end function\n\n      end program\n\n  But wait: the digit_sum function for nonnegative numbers: \n\n      For a=0: \n          n=0, while (n>=10) false, then s=0 -> returns 0.\n\n      For a=10: \n          n=10 -> loop: \n               s=0+0, then n=10/10=1 -> then loop: 1>=10? false -> then s=0+1=1 -> returns 1.\n\n      But the digit sum of 10 is 1. Correct.\n\n      However, the original Java function for a=10:\n\n          ans=0\n          while (a>=10) -> true: ans += 10%10=0, a=10/10=1 -> then a<10 -> break, then ans+=1 -> 1.\n\n      So it matches.\n\n  But what about negative? \n\n      We are handling negative by returning the number itself? \n\n      But the original Java function for a=-1: returns -1.\n\n      But in the third program, when N=0, we call digit_sum(N-1)=digit_sum(-1) -> -1.\n\n      Then initial ans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\n      Then the answer for N=0 is 0.\n\n      For N=1: digit_sum(0)=0? because 0 is nonnegative: \n          n=0, while (0>=10) false -> returns 0.\n\n      So for N=1: initial ans = 1+0=1.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      integer function digit_sum(a)\n        integer, intent(in) :: a\n        integer :: n, s\n        if (a < 0) then\n            digit_sum = a\n            return\n        end if\n        s = 0\n        n = a\n        do while (n >= 10)\n            s = s + mod(n,10)\n            n = n / 10\n        end do\n        s = s + n\n        digit_sum = s\n      end function\n\n  But note: in the original Java, the digit_sum for positive numbers is the sum of the digits. For negative, it returns the negative number? \n\n  We are matching.\n\n  However, the third program in the original was designed for N>=1? But in our chain, we call it with 0 or 1.\n\n  It works.\n\n  But note: the third program might be called with N=0 and N=1, and we have defined it.\n\n  Therefore, the complete Fortran program.\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original also handles N up to 100000? But in our chain, we only call it with 0 or 1.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  But what if the first_token is a large integer? In our DFS, the first_token is a node index (1-indexed) and the node index is at most numNode, which can be up to 100000? \n\n  Then the second program: \n        if (first_token==1) then ... \n        else ...\n\n  This works.\n\n  Let me test with a small graph:\n\n      Example: 2 nodes, 2 edges? But 2 edges between the same pair? That is a multigraph? \n\n      The first program: \n          Input: \n             2 2\n             1 2\n             1 2\n\n          Then the graph: \n             node0: [1,1]  -> but in 1-indexed: \n                 node1: [2,2]\n                 node2: [1,1]\n\n          Then DFS starting at node1:\n\n             visited[1]=1\n             neighbors: 2 and 2.\n\n             First neighbor: 2 -> not parent, visited[2]=0 -> so DFS(2,1)\n\n                 In DFS(2,1):\n                    visited[2]=1\n                    neighbors: 1 and 1.\n                    First neighbor: 1 -> parent? yes (parent=1) -> skip.\n                    Second neighbor: 1 -> parent -> skip.\n                    Then visited[2]=2 -> return.\n\n                 Then back to node1: \n                    after DFS(2,1): we check odd[2] -> initially false, so we output (1,2) and flip odd[1] -> now odd[1]=true.\n\n             Then next neighbor: 2 -> visited[2]==2 -> then output (1,2) and flip odd[1] -> now odd[1]=false.\n\n             Then visited[1]=2.\n\n          The output of the first program:\n\n             1 2\n             1 2\n\n          The first token is 1.\n\n          Then the second program: input=1 -> output=0.\n\n          The third program: input=0 -> output=0.\n\n      The entire chain outputs 0.\n\n  Without the chain, the first program outputs two edges. Then the second program would read 1 and output 0. Then the third outputs 0.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  But note: the first program outputs two edges, but the second program only reads the first token (1) and ignores the rest? \n\n  In the chain, the second program reads the first token and leaves the rest in the input buffer? Then the third program would try to read and fail? \n\n  But the problem says the entire sequence: each program is run independently. The second program reads from the entire output of the first? \n\n  How is the output of the first passed to the second? \n\n      In a pipe: \n          program1 | program2 | program3\n\n      So program2 reads the first token from program1's output and leaves the rest unread? Then program3 would read the next token? \n\n  But the second program only reads one token. The third program reads one integer? \n\n  So the second program reads the first token, and the third program reads the next token? \n\n  But that next token is the second token of the first line? \n\n  Example: the first program outputs \"1 2\\n1 2\\n\". \n\n      The second program reads the token \"1\" -> then outputs \"0\\n\". \n\n      The third program reads the token \"0\" from the second program? \n\n  But the second program outputs \"0\\n\", so the third program reads 0.\n\n  Therefore, the chain is:\n\n      program1: outputs \"1 2\\n1 2\\n\"\n      program2: reads the first token \"1\", then outputs \"0\\n\"\n      program3: reads \"0\", then outputs 0.\n\n  So the final output is 0.\n\n  But in our Fortran, we captured only the first token (1) and then ran the second and third on that. \n\n  Then we output 0.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, we have a plan.\n\n  However, note: the first program might output an edge that starts with a number with more than one digit? \n\n      Example: first_token=123, then we capture 123.\n\n  Then the second program: \n        if (123==1) -> false -> then output 1.\n\n  Then the third program: input=1 -> output=1.\n\n  So the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n  But the original chain:\n\n      The first program outputs \"123 ...\", the second program reads 123 and outputs 1, the third program outputs 1.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  Note: We are using a derived type for the graph. This is Fortran 2003.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n\n  Due to the complexity, we must be cautious.\n\n  We assume the input nodes are 1-indexed and we use 1-indexed throughout.\n\n  Steps for the graph:\n\n      We read numNode, numEdge.\n\n      If numEdge is even, then we read the edges and build the graph.\n\n      We then run the DFS.\n\n  We'll assume the maximum numNode is 200000, so we use dynamic allocation.\n\n  We'll write the entire program.\n\n  However, note: the DFS is recursive. We might run into recursion depth? But the graph is not necessarily a tree. \n\n  We can change to iterative DFS? But the original is recursive.\n\n  We'll assume the stack can handle the recursion.\n\n  But Fortran usually has limited stack size. We can change to iterative DFS? \n\n  Given time, we do iterative DFS.\n\n  How to convert the recursive DFS to iterative?\n\n      We use a stack. We store (crt, parent, index) where index is the next neighbor index to visit.\n\n      We'll create a stack:\n\n          type :: StackNode\n              integer :: crt, parent, next_index\n          end type\n\n          stack: array of StackNode, and a pointer.\n\n      But to save time, we do recursive. We hope the graph is not too deep.\n\n  If we do iterative, it might be more robust.\n\n  Due to the constraints (numNode up to 200000) we must do iterative to avoid stack overflow.\n\n  We convert the DFS to iterative.\n\n  How:\n\n      We maintain:\n\n          visited: as before\n          odd: as before\n          stack: to store (crt, parent, current_index)\n\n          current_index: the next neighbor to visit for node crt.\n\n      We also need to simulate the recursive calls.\n\n      Algorithm:\n\n          push (start, parent, 1)   ! 1 means we start at the first neighbor\n\n          while stack not empty:\n\n             pop the top -> (crt, parent, index)\n\n             If we are entering the node for the first time (index==1), then we set visited(crt)=1.\n\n             Then, we look at the neighbors starting from index:\n\n                 For i = index to size(neighbors of crt)\n\n                    child = neighbors(crt)[i]\n\n                    if child==parent: continue\n\n                    if visited(child)==1: \n                         then we do the back edge action? But wait, in the recursive we had three branches.\n\n                    Actually, the structure of the DFS:\n\n                         We are in the middle of a loop.\n\n          We design:\n\n             We store for each node: \n                 the current index in the neighbor list we are processing.\n\n          We'll have:\n\n             stack: last in first out.\n\n             We start by pushing (crt=1, parent=0, next_index=1)\n\n          Then:\n\n             while stack not empty:\n\n                 top = stack(size(stack))\n                 crt = top%crt, idx = top%next_index, parent=top%parent\n\n                 If idx==1, then mark visited(crt)=1   ! first time we see this node.\n\n                 If idx > size(neighbors) then:\n                     mark visited(crt)=2\n                     pop\n                     continue\n\n                 child = neighbors(crt)[idx]\n\n                 We update the stack: top%next_index = idx+1   (so next time we start at the next neighbor)\n\n                 if child==parent: \n                     continue to next (so we do nothing, and the next neighbor will be processed in the next pop)\n\n                 if visited(child)==1: \n                     This is a back edge? \n                     Then we do:\n                         if not token_captured: first_token = crt; token_captured=.true.\n                         odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                     and then continue to next neighbor? \n\n                 if visited(child)==2: \n                     Then we do:\n                         if not token_captured: first_token = crt; token_captured=.true.\n                         odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                     and then continue to next neighbor? \n\n                 if visited(child)==0: \n                     Then we push (crt, parent, idx)   ? But we are going to recurse to child, so we need to suspend crt and start child.\n\n                     But we already updated the index for crt to idx+1? \n\n                     Then we push for child: (child, crt, 1)\n\n                     And then break (so that we start processing child immediately). \n\n                     But in the iterative, we push and then in the next iteration we process child.\n\n          But what about after we finish the child? \n\n          In the recursive version, after the child returns, we do:\n\n                 if (odd[child]) then ... else ...\n\n          How to simulate that?\n\n          We need to know when we return from a child. We can do:\n\n             When we finish a node (when we pop it because we've processed all neighbors), then we return to the parent's context? \n\n          But the parent is still on the stack? \n\n          Yes.\n\n          Then, after we finish a node (when we pop it), we can update the parent's odd state? \n\n          But how to know the parent? \n\n          We store parent in the stack node for the child.\n\n          But when we pop a child node, we can get the parent node from the top of the stack? \n\n          Actually, the parent's context is the next node in the stack? \n\n          We can have:\n\n             when we pop a node (child) that has parent=p, then we look at the stack: the top should be the parent p? \n\n          But the parent p might be in the middle of its own neighbor processing.\n\n          We can store a separate parent pointer for the child? \n\n          We have in the stack node: parent. When we pop the child, we know its parent.\n\n          Then we do:\n\n             if the child was not visited? (we just finished it) -> then we do the post processing: \n                 if odd(child) then \n                    output (child, parent) and flip odd(child)\n                 else\n                    output (parent, child) and flip odd(parent)\n\n          But we are not storing the entire output, only the first token. \n\n          So we do:\n\n             if (odd(child)) then\n                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                     first_token = child\n                     token_captured = .true.\n                 end if\n                 odd(child) = .not. odd(child)\n             else\n                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                     first_token = parent\n                     token_captured = .true.\n                 end if\n                 odd(parent) = .not. odd(parent)\n             end if\n\n          But note: the parent's state (odd(parent)) is stored in the parent's node. The parent is still in the stack? \n\n          Yes, the parent is in the stack. So we can access and update odd(parent).\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the parent might be finished? No, because we are still processing the parent's neighbors.\n\n          Therefore, we can do.\n\n          Steps for iterative DFS:\n\n              allocate a stack (we can use an array of a derived type, and a stack pointer)\n\n              type :: StackFrame\n                  integer :: crt, parent, next_index\n              end type\n\n              We'll use an allocatable array for the stack.\n\n              We also need an array for the current next_index for each node? Or we store per stack frame.\n\n              We start:\n\n                  allocate(stack(initial_size))\n                  stack_size = 0\n\n                  call push(StackFrame(1,0,1))\n\n              while (stack_size>0)\n\n                 frame = stack(stack_size)   ! top\n                 crt = frame%crt\n                 parent = frame%parent\n                 idx = frame%next_index\n\n                 if (idx == 1) then\n                     visited(crt) = 1   ! mark as in progress\n                 end if\n\n                 if (idx > size(connect(crt)%neighbors)) then\n                     ! finished this node: mark as done\n                     visited(crt) = 2\n                     call pop   (stack_size = stack_size-1)\n                     ! if this node is not the root, then we do the post processing for the parent\n                     ! But wait, in the recursive version, the post processing (after the DFS call) is done in the parent's context.\n                     ! Here, we are popping the child. The parent is the next in the stack? \n\n                     ! Actually, the parent's frame is still on the stack.\n\n                     ! However, the parent's frame has its own state. We do not do the post processing here for the parent, but for the child popping, we do the post processing that the parent would do after the DFS call.\n\n                     ! Specifically, after we finish a child, we then update the parent's state and possibly output an edge.\n\n                     ! But how do we know the parent's frame? \n\n                     ! We stored the parent in the child's frame. So we have parent_node = parent (which is the parent's node index).\n\n                     ! But the parent's frame might not be the top of the stack now? \n\n                     ! It is, because we are doing depth-first: we return to the parent immediately after the child.\n\n                     ! However, in our iterative, we are popping the child, and then the parent becomes the top.\n\n                     ! But we have popped the child, and the parent is now the top. But we haven't advanced the parent's next_index.\n\n                     ! And we haven't done the post processing.\n\n                     ! We need to do the post processing for the edge between parent and child.\n\n                     ! How about: after we finish a child, we do not pop the parent? We leave the parent and then in the next iteration, the parent will continue.\n\n                     ! But then when do we do the post processing? \n\n                     ! In the recursive version, the post processing happens immediately after the recursive call returns.\n\n                     ! In iterative, we can do it after we finish the child, before popping the child? \n\n                     ! But then we have the parent's node index stored in the child's frame.\n\n                     ! So after we finish the child (when we are about to pop it), we:\n\n                         if (parent /= 0) then   ! parent exists\n                             if (odd(crt)) then   ! crt is the child\n                                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                                     first_token = crt\n                                     token_captured = .true.\n                                 end if\n                                 odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                             else\n                                 if (.not.token_captured) then\n                                     first_token = parent\n                                     token_captured = .true.\n                                 end if\n                                 odd(parent) = .not. odd(parent)\n                             end if\n                         end if\n\n                     ! Then pop the child.\n\n                     ! But note: the parent's frame is still on the stack.\n\n                     ! This is the same as the recursive version.\n\n                     ! So we do that.\n\n                     ! But also, we are popping the child.\n\n                     ! Then we continue to the next iteration (which will be the parent).\n\n                     ! How do we ensure the parent's state is updated? We updated odd(parent) if needed.\n\n                     ! Then the parent will continue with the next neighbor.\n\n                 else\n\n                     child = connect(crt)%neighbors(idx)\n\n                     ! We have to update the current frame's next_index to idx+1\n                     stack(stack_size)%next_index = idx+1\n\n                     if (child == parent) then\n                         cycle   ! next iteration of the while loop (which will be the same node, next index)\n                     end if\n\n                     if (visited(child)==1) then\n                         cycle   ! skip, and we've advanced the index, so next time we'll go to the next neighbor.\n                     end if\n\n                     if (visited(child)==2) then\n                         ! This is a back edge to a finished node? \n                         ! Then we do the back edge action.\n                         if (.not.token_captured) then\n                             first_token = crt\n                             token_captured = .true.\n                         end if\n                         odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                         cycle\n                     end if\n\n                     if (visited(child)==0) then\n                         ! We push the child and then break to process the child.\n                         call push(StackFrame(child, crt, 1))\n                         ! and then we go to the next iteration (which will be the child)\n                     end if\n\n                 end if\n\n              end while\n\n          But wait, we have two places to update the token and odd array: \n            1. When we see a back edge to a finished node (visited(child)==2) -> then we update.\n            2. When we finish a child node (in the popping of the child) -> then we update.\n\n          But what about a back edge to an in-progress node (visited(child)==1)? \n             In the recursive version, we skip: \n                 if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) -> continue\n\n          In our iterative, we do the same: \n                 if (visited(child)==1) then \n                     cycle   [we skip]\n\n          And for visited(child)==2, we do the back edge action.\n\n          Also, when we push a child, we don't do anything else.\n\n          This matches.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem does not specify the size, and to avoid stack overflow, we will do iterative DFS.\n\n  We'll implement the iterative DFS.\n\n  Steps for iterative DFS:\n\n      type StackFrame\n          integer :: node, parent, next_index\n      end type\n\n      We'll maintain:\n\n          stack: an array of StackFrame (we can grow as needed) \n          stack_size: integer\n\n      We also need to allocate visited, odd arrays.\n\n  Due to the length, I provide the iterative DFS version.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the first program uses 0-indexed, but we use 1-indexed.\n\n  We assume the worst-case stack depth is the number of nodes.\n\n  We allocate the stack to size numNode.\n\n  Let's write the Fortran program.\n\n  Due to the complexity and length, we hope it is correct.\n\n  We'll write in Fortran 2003.\n\n  Note: the digit_sum function and the third_program subroutine are as above.\n\n  We'll now write the entire program."
