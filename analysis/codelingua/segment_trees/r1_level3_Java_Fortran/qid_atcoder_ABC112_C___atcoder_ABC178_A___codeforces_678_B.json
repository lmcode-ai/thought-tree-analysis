Therefore, we design:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, then n triplets (x, y, h) for the first program. Step 2: Find the candidate center (cx, cy, ch) as in the first program. We break at the first candidate found (because the problem says unique) and store cx. Step 3: Let x = cx (the candidate cx we found).

But the starting year y is the input to the third program, and we stored leap0 = leapness(y). Then we require that leapness(i) == leap0?",

But note: in Fortran, mod of a negative? We are only passing nonnegative years? because the starting year is 0 or 1? and then we are increasing. So it's safe. Also, the first program uses absolute value: we use abs in Fortran. Let me test with a small example for the first program? But the problem says to combine. We output the next year for the third program. We write the entire Fortran program as above. Note: We must be cautious about the modulus: mod(total_days,7) in Fortran: mod(total_days, 7) And we break the loops appropriately. This should be the combined program. But note: the first program might not have found a candidate? then we break out of the loops and then use candidate_cx = -1? which then goes to the second program? Since the problem guarantees a candidate, we assume we found one. Otherwise, we might get an infinite loop in the third program?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The input to the entire sequence is the input for the first program (atcoder_ABC112_C).\n The output of the entire sequence is the output of the last program (codeforces_678_B) but note that the second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) is in the middle.\n\n However, note that the three programs are independent and meant to be run in sequence? \n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let's analyze:\n\n Program 1: atcoder_ABC112_C\n   Input: \n      first integer n, then n triplets (x, y, h)\n   Output: one or more lines of three integers (cx, cy, ch) for each candidate center (cx, cy) that passes the check.\n\n Program 2: atcoder_ABC178_A\n   Input: one integer x (from the output of program1? but program1 outputs multiple lines? and multiple numbers per line? -> this is a problem)\n\n Program 3: codeforces_678_B\n   Input: one integer y (from the output of program2? which is one integer)\n\n How to chain?\n\n The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n But the first program outputs multiple lines? and the second program expects one integer? \n\n This indicates that the programs are not designed to be chained in this way.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n Therefore, we must reinterpret the problem:\n\n We have three separate Java programs. We are to combine them into one Fortran program that does the following:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, then n triplets) and run the logic of the first program.\n\n   Step 2: The output of the first program (which is one or more lines) becomes the input to the second program.\n\n        But note: the second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) expects one integer. So we must use the first output line of the first program? \n        However, the first program might output multiple candidates? Actually, the first program breaks as soon as it finds a candidate and prints it? \n        But wait: the first program has two nested loops (0 to 100) and for each (i,j) it calls check. The check returns -1 if the candidate (cx,cy) doesn't fit, and a positive ch if it does. Then it prints the candidate (i, j, ch) for every candidate that passes? \n\n        But note: the problem says the original chain: the output of the first program is the input to the second. So we must capture the entire output of the first program? However, the second program only reads one integer.\n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically\". But the chain as described might not be meaningful? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might intend that we run the first program and then use its first output line (the first candidate) as the input for the second? \n\n        But the second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) does:\n            int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n            boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n            int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n            out.println(result);\n\n        So if the first program outputs \"10 20 5\", then the second program would try to parse \"10\" as the integer? and then output 1 (because 10 != 1 -> bool false -> !false -> true -> then result = 1? but wait: the code does: \n            int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n        so if bool is false, result is 1.\n\n        Then the third program takes that result (which is 1) and runs.\n\n        However, the third program (codeforces_678_B) expects one integer and then computes the next year that has the same calendar as the input year? \n\n        This chain does not seem to make sense.\n\n        After re-examining: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". But the provided programs are independent and solve different problems.\n\n        Therefore, we must assume that the problem intends that we run the first program and capture its output, then use that entire output as the input to the second program? But the second program only reads one integer.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended that each program is run independently on the same initial input? But that contradicts \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        However, note the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n        And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n        So we design:\n\n          Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the n triplets).\n\n          Step 2: Run the logic of the first program (atcoder_ABC112_C). But note: the first program outputs multiple lines? We are not going to output them. Instead, we must capture the first candidate (or all candidates? but the second program only takes one integer) and then use it as input for the second program.\n\n        How to resolve?\n\n        The problem says: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we will not print the candidate in the middle. Instead, we will store the candidate that the first program would have printed and then pass that candidate (or a part of it) to the second program.\n\n        But note: the second program only uses one integer. The first candidate that the first program finds? But the first program might find multiple candidates? Actually, the problem in atcoder_ABC112_C is to find the center of the pyramid. There should be exactly one candidate? because the condition must hold for all points. So the check function will return the candidate that fits all. However, the code in the first program does:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= MAX; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j <= MAX; j++) {\n                    int ch = check(n, x, y, h, i, j);\n                    if (ch > 0) {\n                        System.out.println(i + \" \" + j + \" \" + ch);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        This means that it prints every candidate (i,j) that passes the check. But the problem states that there is exactly one solution? So we can break after the first candidate? because the problem says the solution is unique? \n\n        However, the original code does not break. It prints every candidate that passes. But the problem (ABC112 C) says: \"It is guaranteed that there exists a unique center\".\n\n        So we can break at the first candidate? But the original code doesn't. However, the problem says the center is unique, so there will be only one candidate. So we can break.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the candidate and then break? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The original program prints all candidates that pass. But the guarantee says there is one. So we can break after the first candidate without changing the behavior? \n\n        However, to be safe, we note that the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we should capture the first candidate and then break? because the second program only uses one integer? But the second program only reads one integer. How do we convert the candidate to one integer? The candidate is three integers. The second program reads one integer. We must choose one? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        After reading the second program: it uses the integer to compute a boolean and then outputs 0 or 1. The third program then uses that 0 or 1? \n\n        But the third program expects a year? and 0 or 1 are not meaningful years.\n\n        This suggests that the chain is not designed by the problem author and we must reinterpret.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        How to proceed?\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we must assume that the problem intends:\n\n          Step 1: Run the first program on its input and capture the first candidate (the first integer of the first candidate, i.e., the cx value) and use that as the input to the second program.\n\n          Step 2: The second program uses that integer to compute 0 or 1.\n\n          Step 3: The third program uses that 0 or 1 as the starting year? which is not meaningful, but that's what the chain does.\n\n        However, the third program (codeforces_678_B) expects a year and then computes the next year with the same calendar. If we input 0 or 1, it will compute the next year with the same calendar as year 0 or 1? \n\n        But the check_leap function: \n            y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0)\n\n        For y=0: \n            In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, year 0 is a leap year? (because 0 mod 400 is 0). So leap year.\n\n        For y=1: not leap.\n\n        Then the third program would run and output the next year that has the same day-of-week start and same leapness? \n\n        But note: the third program does:\n\n            int y = in.nextInt();\n            boolean leap = check_leap(y);\n            ... then it starts from y+1 and adds days until it finds a year where the total days mod 7 is 0 and the leapness is the same.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          - We run the first program and get the first candidate's cx (the i value) -> let's call it candidate_cx.\n\n          - Then we run the second program with input = candidate_cx. The second program outputs 0 or 1.\n\n          - Then we run the third program with that 0 or 1.\n\n        But note: the first program might not output any candidate? then we must not run the next? But the problem guarantee says there is one candidate.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might intend that we run the first program and then use the entire output (as a string) as input to the second? But the second program uses a Scanner which by default would take the first integer and ignore the rest? \n\n        However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The original chain would have the second program reading the first integer from the output of the first. So we do:\n\n          We simulate the first program and capture the first candidate, then take the first integer (cx) of that candidate and use it as the integer for the second program.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, then n triplets (x, y, h).\n\n          Step 2: For the first program, we do:\n                   candidate_cx = -1, candidate_cy = -1, candidate_ch = -1\n                   We break when we find the first candidate (since the problem says unique, we break at the first one).\n\n          Step 3: Then we set an integer variable for the second program: x = candidate_cx.\n\n          Step 4: Then we run the second program logic on x: \n                   bool = (x == 1)   -> if true then bool is true, else false.\n                   result = 0 if bool is true, else 1? \n                   But note: the second program: \n                         int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n                   So if x==1 -> bool=true -> result = 0; else bool=false -> result = 1.\n\n          Step 5: Then we run the third program with y = result (which is 0 or 1).\n\n          Step 6: The third program then computes the next year that has the same calendar as the year 'y'. Then we output that year.\n\n        However, the third program might run forever if we start from 0? because the condition might not be met? \n\n        But the third program breaks when it finds the next year that satisfies:\n            (sum % 7 == 0) and (the leapness of the candidate year is the same as the starting year)\n\n        And note: the starting year is 0 or 1, which are small.\n\n        For starting year = 0 (leap year):\n            We start from i=1: \n                year 1: 365 mod 7 = 1 -> total mod=1 -> then year2: 365 mod7=1 -> total=2 -> ... until we get 7 mod7=0? \n                But we also require that the candidate year has the same leapness? so it must be leap.\n\n            We have to compute the total days mod7 from the starting year (0) until the candidate year? Actually, the code:\n\n                int sum = 0;\n                for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                    if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                    else sum += 365;\n                    if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                        if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                            output i and break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            For y=0: \n                leap = true (from check_leap(0))\n                i=1: not leap -> sum=365 -> 365 mod7=1 -> not 0 -> continue.\n                i=2: not leap -> sum=365+365=730 -> 730 mod7=730%7=730-700=30, 30 mod7=2 -> not 0.\n                ... it will take a while.\n\n            Actually, we know that the cycle of the Gregorian calendar is 400 years? but we are only concerned with the day of the week and leap cycle? \n\n            However, we can compute without worry? because 400 years is 400*365 + number of leap days, which is 97 leap days? so total days = 400*365+97 = 146097, and 146097 mod7 = 0? So the cycle is 400 years. But we are starting at year0, so the same calendar repeats every 400 years? so the next year with the same calendar would be 400? \n\n            But the problem is: we are starting at year0, then we are looking for the next year i (starting from 1) such that the total days from year0 to year i-1 is divisible by 7 and the leapness of year i is the same as year0? \n\n            Actually, the code is accumulating the days from year0 to year i? but note: the starting point is year0. The next year is year1, then year2, etc.\n\n            We are accumulating the days from year0 to year i? but note: we are starting at year0. The first iteration is for i=1: we add the days of year0? No, wait: the code says:\n\n                for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                    if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                    else sum += 365;\n\n            But note: we start at y+1. So for y=0, we start at i=1. Then we add the days of year1? and then we are at the end of year1? \n\n            The condition: we want the day of the week for January 1st of year i to be the same as January 1st of year0? \n\n            The offset between year0 and year1: if year0 is leap (366 days) then the next year (year1) starts (366 mod7) days after the day of year0? but the code is not adding the days of the starting year? \n\n            Actually, the problem: \n                The input is a year y. We want to find the next year after y that has the same calendar (i.e., same day of the week for each date) and the same leap pattern? \n\n            How the code works:\n                It accumulates the number of days from the year y (exclusive) to the candidate year (inclusive)? Actually, no: \n\n                We start at y+1. We add the days for year y+1? then we check the total mod7? and then check the leap pattern of the candidate year (which is the current i, which is the candidate year) and compare with the leap pattern of the starting year y.\n\n            The idea: the day of the week for January 1st of the candidate year is (January 1st of year y + total_days) mod7? and we want that to be the same as year y? so we require total_days mod7=0? and also the leap pattern must be the same so that the whole year matches.\n\n            Therefore, we are accumulating the days from year y (the starting year) to the candidate year-1? Actually, we are accumulating the days from year y+1 to the candidate year? \n\n            The code: \n                for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                    if (check_leap(i)) sum += 366;\n                    else sum += 365;\n\n            Then we check at the candidate year i: the total days from y+1 to i? but we want the offset from y to i? \n\n            Actually, the offset from January 1st of year y to January 1st of year i is the sum of the days in the years y, y+1, ..., i-1? \n\n            But the code is adding the days for the year i? That doesn't seem right.\n\n            Let me check: \n                We start at y=0. We want the next year with the same calendar? \n                January 1, year0 is day0. \n                Year0 is leap -> 366 days -> January 1, year1 is day0+366 mod7 = (366 mod7)= 366/7 = 52*7=364 -> 366 mod7=2? so day2.\n                Then the code for i=1 (which is the next year after 0) does:\n                    sum = 0\n                    i=1: check_leap(1)=false -> add 365 -> sum=365 -> 365 mod7=1 -> not 0.\n                Then i=2: add 365 -> sum=730 -> 730 mod7=730-728=2 -> not 0.\n\n            How do we get to 400? \n\n            Actually, the next year that has the same calendar as year0 is year400? because the cycle is 400 years? but we are accumulating 400 years? \n\n            The code would run 400 iterations? which is acceptable? \n\n            But note: the problem says the input to the third program is 0 or 1? so we are only running 400 iterations? which is acceptable.\n\n        So we can simulate the third program for 400 iterations at worst? \n\n        Therefore, we design:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, then n triplets (x, y, h) for the first program.\n\n          Step 2: Find the candidate center (cx, cy, ch) as in the first program. We break at the first candidate found (because the problem says unique) and store cx.\n\n          Step 3: Let x = cx (the candidate cx we found).\n\n          Step 4: Compute:\n                   bool = (x == 1)\n                   result = 0 if bool is true, else 1.\n\n          Step 5: Let y = result.\n\n          Step 6: For the third program:\n                   leap0 = check_leap(y)   [for the starting year y]\n                   Then we start from i = y+1, and we accumulate days (in terms of mod7) until we find a year i such that:\n                         accumulated_days mod7 == 0 \n                         and check_leap(i) == leap0\n\n                   Then output i.\n\n        However, note: the third program in the original code does:\n\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i)) \n                    sum += 366;\n                else \n                    sum += 365;\n                if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                    if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                        output i and break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        But wait: the condition on leapness: \n            We require that the candidate year i has the same leapness as the starting year y? \n\n            But the starting year y is the input to the third program, and we stored leap0 = leapness(y). Then we require that leapness(i) == leap0? \n\n            However, the condition in the code is:\n\n                if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap))\n\n            which is equivalent to: check_leap(i) == leap.\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We'll write a function to check leap year.\n\n        Important: Fortran does not have boolean variables? We can use logical.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read the input for the first program: \n            integer n\n            then n lines, each with three integers: x(i), y(i), h(i)\n\n          Then we simulate the first program:\n\n            We do a double loop: cx from 0 to 100, cy from 0 to 100.\n\n            For each (cx,cy), we call the check function (which we'll write as a function or subroutine).\n\n            The check function for the first program:\n\n              ch = -1\n              Find the first index i such that h(i)>0, then set ch = abs(x(i)-cx)+abs(y(i)-cy)+h(i)\n              Then for every point i, check that:\n                 h(i) = max( ch - abs(x(i)-cx) - abs(y(i)-cy) , 0 )\n              If any fails, return -1 (or a negative) else return ch.\n\n            Then if the returned ch>0, we break the loops and remember cx, cy, ch.\n\n          Then we set x = cx (the candidate cx) for the second program.\n\n          Then the second program:\n\n             if (x == 1) then\n                 result = 0\n             else\n                 result = 1\n             end if\n\n          Then set y = result.\n\n          Then the third program:\n\n             leap0 = check_leap(y)   [function that returns logical]\n\n             sum = 0\n             i = y+1\n             do \n                 if (check_leap(i)) then\n                     sum = sum + 366\n                 else\n                     sum = sum + 365\n                 end if\n                 if (mod(sum,7) == 0) then\n                     if (check_leap(i) .eqv. leap0) then\n                         print *, i\n                         exit\n                     end if\n                 end if\n                 i = i+1\n             end do\n\n        We assume the first program always finds a candidate? because it's guaranteed.\n\n        But what if it doesn't? Then we must not run the second and third? The problem says there is a unique center.\n\n        So we break when we find the candidate.\n\n        However, the original first program does not break? but we break at the first candidate we find? because the problem says unique.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Let's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n        Note: We must not do any I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n          program combined\n          implicit none\n\n          !

We are only passing nonnegative years? because the starting year is 0 or 1? and then we are increasing.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Also, the first program uses absolute value: we use abs in Fortran.\n\n        Let me test with a small example for the first program? \n\n        But the problem says to combine.\n\n        We output the next year for the third program.\n\n        We write the entire Fortran program as above.\n\n        Note: We must be cautious about the modulus: mod(total_days,7) in Fortran: mod(total_days, 7)\n\n        And we break the loops appropriately.\n\n        This should be the combined program.\n\n        But note: the first program might not have found a candidate? then we break out of the loops and then use candidate_cx = -1? which then goes to the second program? \n\n        Since the problem guarantees a candidate, we assume we found one. Otherwise, we might get an infinite loop in the third program? \n\n        We can add a guard: if we didn't find a candidate, we output an error? but the problem says unique candidate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can stop the program if not found? \n\n        We'll leave as is: if not found, then candidate_cx=-1, then the second program: if -1==1? false -> result_val=1, then third program: y_val=1.\n\n        Then run the third program with year=1? which is not leap? and then compute the next year that has the same calendar? \n\n        But if the first program didn't find a candidate, that's an error? but the problem says it is guaranteed.\n\n        So we proceed.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more note: the original first program prints multiple candidates? but we break at the first. Since the solution is unique, the first candidate is the only candidate? so it is the same.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        Let's write the code."
