But the minimal value is the digit sum of N? Not exactly: consider N=10, then A=1 and B=9: digit sum of A=1, B=9 -> 10, but the digit sum of N=1. So that is 10 which is more than 1? Actually, the digit sum of N is 1. But note: the minimal value in the example is 1? Actually, we can have A=0 and B=10? But the program starts A from 1 to n (where n=N/2). And note that the initial value is `sum(1)+sum(9)=1+9=10` and then we try A=5: 5+5 -> 5+5=10, same. But the minimum is 1? Actually, the program initializes to `sum(1)+sum(N-1)`. For N=10, that is `sum(1)+sum(9)=1+9=10`. Then it loops A from 1 to 5: \n  A=1: 1+9=10\n  A=2: 2+8=10\n  ... A=5: 5+5=10\n\nSo the answer is 10. But actually, the minimal digit sum for splitting 10 is 1? Because 0+10: but the program does not consider A=0. The problem in the original code: it starts A from 1 to n (which is 5). So it does not consider A=0. But note the initial value is set to `sum(1)+sum(9)=10`. Then we don't try A=0. However, the problem says: \"for (int A = 1; A <= n; A++)\". So we are not including A=0. But note: the problem of splitting N into two nonnegative integers A and B such that A+B=N and A>=0, B>=0. The problem does not require A>0? But the program starts at A=1. Why? Because the initial value is set for A=1 and B=N-1? And then they only consider A in [1, n] and note that by symmetry, we can assume A<=B, so A in [1, floor(N/2)]? Actually, the code sets n = (N%2==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2. Then the loop goes from A=1 to A=n. But note: if N is even, then n = N/2, so we go up to A=N/2. If N is odd, then n = (N+1)/2, which is the same as (N+1)/2, which is greater than N/2? Actually, (N+1)/2 is the ceiling of N/2? For odd N: let N=5, then n= (5+1)/2=3. Then we try A=1,2,3. But note that when A=3, then B=2, which is the same as A=2 and B=3? So we are including both? Actually, the problem doesn't require A<=B? The function is symmetric? But the initial value is set to A=1 and B=N-1, which is the same as A=N-1 and B=1? And the loop goes from A=1 to A=n (which is the ceiling of N/2). But note: the minimal value might occur at A=0? But the program does not consider A=0. However, the problem says: the initial value is set to `sum(1)+sum(N-1)`. So we are forced to consider A>=1. Therefore, we must do the same. Now, we design the Fortran program. We will use:\n\n  integer(kind=8) for large integers (like the result of the first program and for the second program's modulo arithmetic, and for the third program's N and the loop variable A? But note: the third program uses `int` for A and for the digit sum.",

Then A is from 1 to n (so positive) and N-A is nonnegative? Because A<=n, and n <= (N+1)/2, so A<= (N+1)/2, then N-A >= N - (N+1)/2 = (2N - N -1)/2 = (N-1)/2. Since N>=0, then N-A>=0? Only if N>=A? But note: when N=1, then n=(1+1)/2=1. Then A=1, then N-A=0. So we have to compute sum_digits(0). The Java function: for a=0: \n        while (0>=10) -> false, then ans=0, then add a=0 -> returns 0. But in our function, for a=0: \n        do while (0>=10) -> false, then res = 0 + 0 = 0? Actually, no: we set x=0, then skip the loop, then res = res (which is 0) + x (which is 0) -> 0. For a negative? The original Java program does not handle negatives? Because the input N is positive and A is from 1 to n, then N-A is nonnegative? So we are safe. However, in the initial value: we compute sum_digits(1) and sum_digits(N-1). If N=0, then N-1=-1. The original Java function: for a=-1: \n        while (-1>=10) -> false, then add a=-1 -> returns -1. But the chain: the second program's output is between 0 and 1000000006, so N>=0. Then N-1 is at least -1? But when N=0, then we get -1. But the second program's output is 0? Then N=0? Then we have to compute sum_digits(-1). The original Java program would return -1? So the initial value would be 1 + (-1) = 0? Then the loop from A=1 to n (n=0) doesn't run. Then the answer is 0. But in our Fortran function, for a=-1: \n        x = -1\n        while (x>=10) -> false? then res = 0 + (-1) = -1. So we get the same. But note: the third program in the original Java code uses `int a` and the function `sum` for any integer? It might be negative? The problem does not specify. But in the chain, the third program's input is nonnegative? But we are using the output of the second program which is nonnegative? Then why would we get negative? Only in the initial value: when N=0, we compute N-1=-1. But the second program's output is 0 only if the string leads to remainder 5? Actually, the second program's output is the count of numbers mod 13=5 modulo 1e9+7. It can be 0? Yes, if there is no such number. So we must handle negative numbers in the digit sum?",

Because truncation toward zero? In Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? Yes. So for a=-1:\n        res = 0\n        while (a>=10) -> false? then add a: res = 0 + (-1) = -1. So same as Java. Therefore, the function is correct. But note: the third program's initial value: if N=0, then we compute sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0. Then the answer is 0. If N=1: \n        n = (1+1)/2 = 1\n        initial value: sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n        then loop A=1: \n            sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(0) = 1+0=1 -> same as initial, so ans3=1.

Therefore, we write the program as above. But note: the base starts at 1 and then is updated: base = base * 10 mod 13. We use integer(kind=8) for base? But 13 is small, so we can use 4-byte? But to avoid overflow in base * 10: 13*10=130, which fits in 4-byte. But we are using 8-byte for consistency? It doesn't matter. We'll run and hope. One more note: the second program uses the entire string? What if the string is empty? That is, if ans1=0, then the string is \"0\", and L=1. Then we process the digit '0'. Then the state becomes:\n\n        base=1, digit=0, pre=0: new_r = (1*0+0) mod 13 = 0 -> dp_curr(0) += 1. Then base = 1*10 mod13 = 10. Then we are done. Then ans2 = dp_curr(5) = 0? Actually, we set dp_prev=dp_curr at the end, and then we want dp_prev(5). But we only set state 0 to 1, and the rest 0. So dp_prev(5)=0. Then the second program outputs 0. Then the third program runs with N=0. Then we compute: \n        n = 0 (if N=0: mod(0,2)=0 -> n=0)\n        initial value: sum_digits(1)+sum_digits(-1)=1+(-1)=0\n        then loop from A=1 to 0? (none) -> ans3=0. So it outputs 0. But the original first program: if n=1 and arr[0]=0, then ans1=0. Then the second program: the string \"0\" -> the dp: we have one digit and the remainder 0? Then we want remainder 5? 0 mod13=0, so no state 5 -> output 0. Then the third program outputs 0. So it is consistent.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three Java programs to be executed in sequence. However, note that the original problem states that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. But the three programs have different input requirements:\n\n1. The first program (codeforces_596_B) reads an integer `n` and then an array of `n` long integers, and outputs a single long (the computed answer).\n2. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string (a sequence of digits and '?') and outputs a long (modulo 1e9+7).\n3. The third program (atcoder_AGC025_A) reads an integer `N` and outputs an integer.\n\nBut the output of the first program is a single number (a long) and the second program expects a string. Similarly, the output of the second program is a long and the third program expects an integer.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the chain might not be directly compatible. However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, we must design the Fortran program to:\n\n- First, read the input for the first program (which is an integer `n` and then `n` integers).\n- Then, run the first program's logic and store the output (a single long integer).\n- Then, use that output as the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. So we must convert the long integer to a string? However, note that the second program is designed for a string that may contain '?' and digits. But the output of the first program is a single number without any '?'. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the entire set of inputs is provided at the beginning? But the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nAfter re-examining the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nBut note: the original chain would require the output of the first program to be fed as input to the second, and then the output of the second to the third. However, the inputs for the first program and the second program are of different types. This implies that the chain as described might not be intended to be run on the same initial input? Or perhaps the problem expects that the initial input is the one for the first program, and then the next input (for the second program) is the output of the first, and then the third uses the output of the second.\n\nBut the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So the entire chain must run on the same input that the first program originally takes? Then what about the inputs for the second and third? This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the provided programs:\n\n- The first program: input is an integer `n` and then `n` integers. Output is a single number.\n- The second program: input is a string (which is a sequence of digits and '?').\n- The third program: input is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the chain would break because the output of the first (a single integer) would be the entire input for the second? But the second expects a string. So we must represent the integer as a string? That seems acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, the output of the second is a long integer (which is the result modulo 1e9+7) and the third program expects an integer. So we can use that long integer as the input to the third? But note that the third program expects an integer `N` and then does not read any more. So the entire input for the third is that one integer.\n\nTherefore, the chain:\n\n1. First program: reads `n` and then `n` integers -> outputs a single integer (or long) as a string? Actually, the first program prints the integer and that becomes the input string for the second.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string that might contain multiple characters. The output of the first program is a single number that might be multi-digit? Yes.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n- The Fortran program will read the input for the first program: an integer `n` and then `n` integers.\n- Then compute the result of the first program (a single integer, call it `ans1`).\n- Then convert `ans1` to a string. This string will be the input for the second program.\n- Then run the second program with that string and compute its result (a long integer, `ans2`).\n- Then use `ans2` as the integer input for the third program (note: `ans2` might be very large, but the third program reads an integer, and Fortran can handle integers of a certain range. Also, the second program's output is modulo 1e9+7, so it is in the range [0, 10^9+6] which fits in a 4-byte integer? But Fortran integers might be 4-byte, so we use integer(kind=8) to be safe? Actually, the third program in Java uses `int` which is 4-byte, but 10^9 is within the range of 4-byte signed integer. So we can use a 4-byte integer? However, Fortran by default might have 4-byte integers. But to be safe, we can use 8-byte for intermediate and then convert to 4-byte if necessary? But the third program in Java uses `int` for `N`. So we must ensure that `ans2` is in the range of integer for the third program. However, note that `ans2` is modulo 1e9+7, so it is between 0 and 10^9+6, which is within the range of a 4-byte integer. So we can use a 4-byte integer for the third program.\n\nBut note: the third program's input is an integer `N` that is provided by the second program. The third program then computes the answer and outputs it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n- Reads: the first integer `n` and then `n` integers.\n- Computes the first program's output: `ans1`.\n- Converts `ans1` to a string, say `s`.\n- Then uses `s` as the input for the second program.\n- The second program processes the string `s` and computes `ans2` (modulo 1e9+7).\n- Then the third program uses `ans2` as the integer `N` and computes the final answer.\n\nBut note: the third program does not read from standard input in the chain? It reads the integer `N` from the output of the second. So we don't read again from standard input after the first read.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n1. Reads the initial data (for the first program).\n2. Processes the first program and gets `ans1`.\n3. Converts `ans1` to a string and uses that as the input for the second program.\n4. Processes the second program on that string and gets `ans2`.\n5. Uses `ans2` as the integer for the third program and computes the final answer.\n6. Prints the final answer (from the third program).\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we only output the result of the third program.\n\nBut wait: the original chain would output the result of the first program, then the second, then the third? And then we are to combine them so that only the final output (of the third) is printed? The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning the same final output? Or the same output at each step? The problem states: \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\". The original chain would run the first program and output something, then the second would take that and output something, then the third would take that and output the final thing. But in the combined Fortran program, we are only to output the final result? That is not identical behavior because the intermediate outputs are missing.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we are not to output the intermediate results. Therefore, the combined program should only output the final result of the third program.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning the same final output? The problem does not specify whether the intermediate outputs are part of the behavior. But note the instruction: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we must not output the intermediate results.\n\nTherefore, we design:\n\n- Read the initial data for the first program.\n- Compute the first program's result (without printing it) and convert to a string.\n- Use that string as the input for the second program (without reading again from standard input, and without printing anything in between).\n- Compute the second program's result (without printing) and then use that as the integer for the third program.\n- Compute the third program's result and print it.\n\nNow, let's break down each program:\n\n### First Program (codeforces_596_B)\n\nInput: \n  integer n\n  then n integers (arr)\n\nOutput: \n  ans1 = abs(arr[0]) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1])\n\nWe'll compute this and store as a long integer (or a Fortran integer of sufficient size). Note: the problem uses `long` in Java, which is 64-bit. In Fortran, we can use `integer(kind=8)`.\n\n### Second Program (atcoder_ABC135_D)\n\nThis program processes a string from right to left (or left to right? Actually, it reverses the string: `cs[cs.length - 1 - i]`). It uses dynamic programming for modulo 13.\n\nWe note that the string we are passing is the string representation of `ans1` (which is a number, so it contains only digits, no '?'). Therefore, in the second program, we will only use the branch for fixed digits (not the branch for '?').\n\nBut wait: the second program has two branches: if the character is '?' then it loops over 0-9, else it uses the fixed digit. Since our string has only digits, we use the fixed branch.\n\nThe DP state: `dp[i][r]` for processing `i` digits (from rightmost) and having remainder `r` modulo 13.\n\nThe recurrence:\n  base = (10^i) mod 13, but note that the base is updated by `base = base * 10 % 13` at the end of each iteration.\n\nFor the current digit `d` (converted from char) at the position `i` (from right, starting at index0 for the rightmost), we do:\n  for each previous remainder `pre` (from 0 to 12):\n      new_r = (base * d + pre) % 13\n      then add the count from the previous state (if any) to `dp[i][new_r]`\n\nInitialization: \n  For i=0 (the rightmost digit), we consider the previous state as `pre=0` and then we do:\n      dp[0][ (base * d) % 13 ] = 1   [if there's no previous state? Actually, the code says: (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0) ) ]\n\nSo for the first digit (i=0), the previous state is only `pre=0` and then we add 1 for the state (base * d) % 13.\n\nBut note: the base for the first digit (rightmost) is 1? Because the code sets `base = 1` initially.\n\nSo the base for the rightmost digit is 1, then base = (1*10) mod 13 = 10, then base = 10*10 mod13 = 9, then 12, etc.\n\nWe must do the same.\n\nThe output of the second program is `dp[L-1][5]` where L is the length of the string.\n\n### Third Program (atcoder_AGC025_A)\n\nThis program takes an integer `N` (which is `ans2` from the second program) and then:\n\n  It defines a helper function `sum` that computes the sum of the digits of a number (if the number has more than one digit, it breaks it down).\n\n  Then, it sets:\n      n = (N+1)/2   if N is odd, or N/2 if even? Actually, the code sets:\n          if N is even: n = N/2\n          else: n = (N+1)/2\n\n      Then, it initializes `ans` to `sum(1) + sum(N-1)`\n      Then, for A from 1 to n (inclusive), it computes `sum(A) + sum(N-A)` and updates `ans` to the minimum.\n\n  Finally, it outputs `ans`.\n\nWe note that the third program uses integers (int) for all variables.\n\nBut note: the input `N` to the third program is the result of the second program, which is in the range [0, 10^9+6]. The variable `n` in the third program will be about half of `N` (so up to 500,000,000). Then the loop `A from 1 to n` would be 500 million iterations, which is acceptable in C/C++/Java in optimized code? But in Fortran, it might be slow? However, we must replicate the behavior.\n\nBut note: the original third program in Java does this loop. We must do the same.\n\nHowever, we can try to optimize? The problem does not say to optimize, only to translate. So we do the same.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we must do the same computations.\n\nBut wait: the third program's algorithm:\n\n  It computes the digit sum for A and for N-A. The digit sum for A is the sum of the digits of A. Similarly for N-A.\n\n  And we are to find the minimum of `sum(A) + sum(N-A)` for A in [1, n].\n\n  However, note that the problem in the third program is: Given an integer N, split it into two nonnegative integers A and B (with A+B=N) and minimize the sum of the digit sums of A and B.\n\n  And there is a known fact: the digit sum of A plus the digit sum of B is at least the digit sum of N (and if there is no carry, then it equals the digit sum of N). And when there is a carry, it increases? Actually, it can be more. But the minimal value is the digit sum of N? Not exactly: consider N=10, then A=1 and B=9: digit sum of A=1, B=9 -> 10, but the digit sum of N=1. So that is 10 which is more than 1? Actually, the digit sum of N is 1. But note: the minimal value in the example is 1? Actually, we can have A=0 and B=10? But the program starts A from 1 to n (where n=N/2). And note that the initial value is `sum(1)+sum(9)=1+9=10` and then we try A=5: 5+5 -> 5+5=10, same. But the minimum is 1? Actually, the program initializes to `sum(1)+sum(N-1)`. For N=10, that is `sum(1)+sum(9)=1+9=10`. Then it loops A from 1 to 5: \n  A=1: 1+9=10\n  A=2: 2+8=10\n  ... \n  A=5: 5+5=10\n\nSo the answer is 10.\n\nBut actually, the minimal digit sum for splitting 10 is 1? Because 0+10: but the program does not consider A=0. The problem in the original code: it starts A from 1 to n (which is 5). So it does not consider A=0. But note the initial value is set to `sum(1)+sum(9)=10`. Then we don't try A=0. However, the problem says: \"for (int A = 1; A <= n; A++)\". So we are not including A=0.\n\nBut note: the problem of splitting N into two nonnegative integers A and B such that A+B=N and A>=0, B>=0. The problem does not require A>0? But the program starts at A=1. Why? Because the initial value is set for A=1 and B=N-1? And then they only consider A in [1, n] and note that by symmetry, we can assume A<=B, so A in [1, floor(N/2)]? Actually, the code sets n = (N%2==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2. Then the loop goes from A=1 to A=n. But note: if N is even, then n = N/2, so we go up to A=N/2. If N is odd, then n = (N+1)/2, which is the same as (N+1)/2, which is greater than N/2? Actually, (N+1)/2 is the ceiling of N/2? For odd N: let N=5, then n= (5+1)/2=3. Then we try A=1,2,3. But note that when A=3, then B=2, which is the same as A=2 and B=3? So we are including both? Actually, the problem doesn't require A<=B? The function is symmetric? But the initial value is set to A=1 and B=N-1, which is the same as A=N-1 and B=1? And the loop goes from A=1 to A=n (which is the ceiling of N/2). But note: the minimal value might occur at A=0? But the program does not consider A=0. However, the problem says: the initial value is set to `sum(1)+sum(N-1)`. So we are forced to consider A>=1.\n\nTherefore, we must do the same.\n\nNow, we design the Fortran program.\n\nWe will use:\n\n  integer(kind=8) for large integers (like the result of the first program and for the second program's modulo arithmetic, and for the third program's N and the loop variable A? But note: the third program uses `int` for A and for the digit sum. The maximum value of A is about 500 million, which is within 4-byte integer? But 500 million is 5e8, which is less than 2^31-1. So we can use 4-byte integers for the third program? However, to be consistent, we can use 4-byte integers for the third program and 8-byte for the intermediate calculations that require large numbers.\n\nBut note: the first program: the array elements and the answer are `long` in Java (64-bit). The array elements are read as integers? In the Java code: `scan.nextInt()` returns an int, then stored in a long array. So the input integers are 32-bit, but the answer might be large? We use 64-bit integers for the first program.\n\nSimilarly, the second program: the dp array is `long` (64-bit) and modulo 1e9+7, so we can use 64-bit integers for the dp state, but the modulo operations keep the numbers within 0 to 1e9+6? So we can use 32-bit for the dp state? But 1e9+7 is about 2^30, so 32-bit signed integers can hold it? Actually, 2^31 is about 2e9, so 1e9+7 is about 1.000000007e9, which is less than 2^31. So we can use 32-bit? But the dp array might accumulate counts that are large? The counts are modulo 1e9+7? Actually, the counts are stored modulo 1e9+7, so they are in the range [0, 1e9+6]. So we can use 32-bit integers? But 1e9+6 is 1000000006, which is less than 2^31-1 (which is 2147483647). So we can use `integer(kind=4)` for the dp array? However, to avoid overflow in intermediate additions, we might do modulo after each addition. But the problem says to use modulo arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, we can use 64-bit integers for the dp array and then mod at the end? Actually, the Java code does mod at each step. We can do the same in Fortran.\n\nSo let's decide:\n\n  For the first program: use `integer(kind=8)` for the array and the answer.\n\n  For the second program: the string is the string representation of the first program's answer. We'll convert the integer (which is 64-bit) to a string. The length of the string is at most 20 (since 2^64 is 20 digits). Then we process the string from rightmost to leftmost. We'll use a dp array of dimensions (0:len-1, 0:12) and we use `integer(kind=4)` or `integer(kind=8)`? The mod is 1e9+7, which is about 1e9, and we are adding at most 10 * (previous state) per digit. The previous state is at most 1e9? So the addition for one state might be 10 * 1e9 = 10e9, which is 10^10, which fits in 64-bit? But we can do modulo at each addition? The Java code does modulo at each addition. So we can use 64-bit for the dp array and then mod by 1000000007 (which is 1e9+7).\n\n  For the third program: the input `N` is the result of the second program (which is modulo 1e9+7, so it is in the range [0, 1000000006]). Then we use `integer` (which is 4-byte) for N and the variables. But note: the variable `n` in the third program might be up to 500000003 (if N is 1000000006, then n = (1000000006+1)/2 = 500000003.5 -> in integer division, it would be 500000003). Then the loop runs 500 million times. We can use 4-byte integers for A and the helper function. The digit sum function: the maximum digit sum for a number around 1e9 is 9*10=90? So we can use 4-byte.\n\nBut note: Fortran by default uses 4-byte integers when we declare `integer`. We can rely on that? However, we might need to specify the kind for large numbers.\n\nPlan:\n\n  We'll use:\n      integer(kind=8) for the first program's array and the answer `ans1`.\n      integer(kind=8) for the second program's dp array and the base and intermediate calculations, and for the modulo value (1000000007_8) and the result `ans2`.\n      Then for the third program, we convert `ans2` to a 4-byte integer? But note: `ans2` is between 0 and 1000000006, which fits in a 4-byte integer. So we can do:\n          integer :: N = int(ans2, kind=4)\n      and then use 4-byte integers for the rest of the third program.\n\nBut note: the third program's helper function `sum` takes an integer (4-byte) and returns the digit sum (4-byte). The loop variable A is 4-byte and goes from 1 to n (which is about 500 million) and that is acceptable in Fortran? It might be slow, but we do it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use 4-byte integers for the entire third program.\n\nBut note: the first program might have a very large `ans1`? For example, if the array is large and the differences are large. The maximum `ans1` might be as large as 10^15? So we must use 64-bit for the first program.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nStep 1: Read the initial data.\n\n  integer(kind=4) :: n\n  integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  do i=1, n\n      read(*,*) arr(i)\n  end do\n\nStep 2: Compute `ans1` (first program)\n\n  ans1 = abs(arr(1))\n  do i=2, n\n      ans1 = ans1 + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n  end do\n\nStep 3: Convert `ans1` to a string.\n\n  We can write the integer to a character variable. We know the maximum length is 20.\n\n  character(len=20) :: s\n  write(s, '(I0)') ans1   ! This writes without leading spaces, and we don't know the length exactly.\n\n  But note: the string might have leading spaces? The format '(I0)' writes the integer without leading spaces? Yes. But then we need to trim? Actually, the variable `s` is 20 characters. We can adjust to the actual length? Or we can use:\n\n      write(s, *) ans1   ! This will write with leading spaces? Then we can trim.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: str\n      integer :: len_str\n      ! Determine the length needed?\n      ! Instead, we can write to a buffer and then adjust.\n\n  But Fortran doesn't have automatic trimming in write without format? We can use:\n\n      write(s, '(I0)') ans1\n\n  Then we can find the actual length by:\n\n      len_str = len_trim(adjustl(s))   ? But adjustl removes leading spaces and then trim removes trailing? Actually, we want the entire number without leading zeros? But the number is positive? The absolute value is taken? The first program uses `abs` for the first element and then absolute differences. So `ans1` is nonnegative. So we can just remove leading spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      s = adjustl(s)   ! This moves the number to the left and then we can use the non-blank part.\n\n  But we need the entire string without leading spaces. Then we can compute the length:\n\n      len_trim(s)   ! This gives the length without trailing spaces? Actually, we want without leading and trailing? But the trailing will be spaces? The write with format I0 will write the number without leading zeros and without leading spaces? Actually, the format I0 writes the integer in minimal width. So the string `s` will have the number and then spaces at the end? Then we can take the substring: s(1:len_trim(s))? But the dynamic programming in the second program expects the entire string including the order? Actually, the second program processes from the last character to the first? So we need the entire string without trailing spaces? Actually, we can use the entire allocated string? But the second program uses the length of the string (the array `cs`). We can get the actual length of the number by:\n\n          L = len_trim(s)\n\n  Then we can process the string from the last character (index L) to the first (index 1)? But note: the second program does:\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n              char c = cs[cs.length - 1 - i];\n\n  So it starts from the last character and goes backwards. In Fortran, we can do:\n\n          do i=1, L\n              c = s(L-i+1:L-i+1)\n\n  But note: we have the string `s` of length 20, but the actual number is the first L characters? Actually, when we write with `write(s, '(I0)') ans1`, the number is left-justified? Actually, no: the I0 format writes the integer without leading spaces, and then the rest of the string is padded with spaces? So the number is at the beginning? Then the trailing characters are spaces. But we only care about the non-space part? The second program expects a string of digits. The spaces are not digits? So we must only use the non-space part.\n\n  Therefore, we set:\n\n          L = len_trim(s)   ! This gives the number of non-space characters at the beginning? Actually, `len_trim` returns the length without trailing spaces. But the number is written without leading spaces and then the rest are trailing spaces? Then `len_trim` returns the length of the number.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n          do i = 0, L-1   ! because we have L characters, and we want to process from last char (index L) to first (index 1)\n              c = s(L-i:L-i)   ! for the i-th character from the right (i=0 is the last, i=1 is the second last, etc.)\n\n  But note: the second program uses i as the index from 0 to L-1, and the character is at `cs[cs.length-1-i]`. So in our string of length L (without trailing spaces), the last character is at L, then the one before at L-1, etc.\n\n  So we can create a character array of length L? Or we can just use the substring of s(1:L) and then index it from the end.\n\n  Alternatively, we can create a new string without the trailing spaces? Actually, we can work with the substring `s(1:L)`.\n\n  Then we process:\n\n          base = 1\n          dp = 0   ! we'll use a 2D array for dp(0:L-1, 0:12) but in Fortran, we can index from 0:12 and 0 to L-1? Or we can use 1:L and 1:13? We'll index the dp array as (0:12, 0:L-1) or (0:L-1, 0:12)? We'll do:\n\n          integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:12, 0:L-1)   ! but note: the first index is remainder, the second is the position.\n\n          But the recurrence: for each position i (from 0 to L-1) and for each remainder pre (0 to 12), we update the new remainder.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          dp_new(0:12) for the current position, and we update from the previous state (which is the state for the next digit to the right?).\n\n          We'll do for i=0 to L-1 (which corresponds to the i-th digit from the right).\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Initialize dp_prev(0) = 1, and others=0? But note: the Java code initializes by:\n\n            if (i>0) then use dp[i-1][pre] else (if pre==0 then 1 else 0)\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            dp_prev(0) = 1   ! at the start (for the state before the first digit from the right)\n\n          Then for each digit (from the last to the first, i.e., i=0 to L-1):\n\n            base_i = base\n            c = s(L-i:L-i)   ! the (L-i)-th character in the string (which is the i-th from the right)\n            digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')   ! convert to integer\n\n            Then for each pre in 0:12:\n                new_r = mod( base_i * digit + pre, 13_8 )   ! we do mod 13? But base_i is mod 13? Yes, the base is updated modulo 13.\n\n            Then set dp_current(new_r) += dp_prev(pre)\n\n            Then mod by 1000000007.\n\n          Then set base = mod(base * 10, 13_8)\n          Then set dp_prev = dp_current   (and then reset dp_current to 0 for the next iteration)\n\n          But note: the Java code does:\n\n            for (pre=0; pre<13; pre++)\n                dp[i][ (base * digit + pre) % 13 ] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0))\n\n          We can simulate without storing the entire dp array? We only need the previous state.\n\n          So we'll use:\n\n            integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_curr(0:12)\n\n          Steps:\n\n            dp_prev = 0\n            dp_prev(0) = 1   ! for the state before any digit\n\n            base = 1\n            do i=0, L-1   ! i is the index from the right, starting at 0 (the last digit) to L-1 (the first digit)\n                dp_curr = 0\n                c = s(L-i:L-i)   ! the i-th character from the right (i=0: last, i=1: second last, ... i=L-1: first)\n                digit = ichar(c) - 48   ! '0' is 48\n\n                do pre = 0, 12\n                    new_r = mod( base * digit + pre, 13_8 )   ! mod 13\n                    dp_curr(new_r) = mod(dp_curr(new_r) + dp_prev(pre), 1000000007_8)\n                end do\n\n                base = mod(base * 10, 13_8)\n                dp_prev = dp_curr\n            end do\n\n          Then the answer for the second program is dp_prev(5)   ! because we want remainder 5.\n\n          But note: the Java program does:\n\n            base = base * 10 % 13   after processing the digit.\n\n          And the base for the next digit is this updated base.\n\n          And the dp_prev becomes the current state for the next digit.\n\n          So after processing all L digits, the state is in dp_prev.\n\n          Then set ans2 = dp_prev(5)\n\nStep 4: Third program\n\n  Convert ans2 to a 4-byte integer: N = int(ans2, kind=4)\n\n  Then:\n\n      n = (N+1)/2   ! if N is odd, but note: integer division in Fortran: for odd N, (N+1)/2 is the ceiling? Actually, if we use integer division: \n          if mod(N,2)==0 then\n              n = N/2\n          else\n              n = (N+1)/2   ! but (N+1)/2 might be (N+1)/2 in integer: for N=5: (5+1)/2=3, which is correct.\n\n      But note: the Java code:\n\n          if (N % 2 == 0) {\n              n = N / 2;\n          } else {\n              n = (N + 1) / 2;\n          }\n\n      We can do the same.\n\n      Then:\n\n          ans3 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)   ! but note: the function `sum_digits` is defined as:\n\n          function sum_digits(a) result(res)\n              integer, intent(in) :: a\n              integer :: res, x\n              x = a\n              res = 0\n              do while (x >= 10)\n                  res = res + mod(x,10)\n                  x = x / 10\n              end do\n              res = res + x\n          end function\n\n      Then:\n\n          do A=1, n\n              temp = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n              if (temp < ans3) then\n                  ans3 = temp\n              end if\n          end do\n\n      Then print ans3.\n\nBut note: the third program in Java:\n\n        int ans = sum(1) + sum(N - 1);\n        for (int A = 1; A <= n; A++) {\n            if (sum(A) + sum(N - A) < ans) {\n                ans = sum(A) + sum(N - A);\n            }\n        }\n\nWe do the same.\n\nHowever, note: the third program uses `sum(1) + sum(N-1)` as the initial value. Then we iterate from A=1 to A=n. So we don't need to consider A=0.\n\nNow, we write the entire Fortran program.\n\nWe must be cautious with the array indexing and loops.\n\nLet's code:\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      ! For the first program\n      integer :: n_i4   ! we read n as 4-byte integer? The input n can be up to 200,000? So we use 4-byte.\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans1\n      integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n      integer :: i\n\n      ! For the second program\n      character(len=20) :: s\n      integer :: L\n      integer(kind=8) :: base, digit, new_r\n      integer :: pre, i_digit\n      integer(kind=8) :: dp_prev(0:12), dp_curr(0:12)\n      integer(kind=8) :: ans2, mod_val = 1000000007_8\n\n      ! For the third program\n      integer :: N, n, A, temp, ans3\n      integer, external :: sum_digits   ! or we can use internal function\n\n      ! Step 1: Read the initial data\n      read(*,*) n_i4\n      allocate(arr(n_i4))\n      do i=1, n_i4\n          read(*,*) arr(i)\n      end do\n\n      ! Step 2: First program\n      ans1 = abs(arr(1))\n      do i=2, n_i4\n          ans1 = ans1 + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n      end do\n\n      ! Step 3: Convert ans1 to string\n      write(s, '(I0)') ans1   ! This writes the integer to s with no leading spaces and then pads with spaces at the end? The length of s is 20.\n      L = len_trim(s)         ! This gives the length without trailing spaces? Actually, the I0 format writes without leading spaces and then the rest are trailing spaces? Then len_trim counts the non-space part.\n\n      ! Now, we process the string for the second program\n      base = 1\n      dp_prev = 0\n      dp_prev(0) = 1\n\n      do i_digit = 0, L-1\n          dp_curr = 0\n          ! Get the character at position L - i_digit (because i_digit=0 is the last char, i_digit=1 is the second last, ...)\n          ! But note: s is a fixed-length string of 20, but we are using the substring of length L. The character we want is at L - i_digit (if we index from 1 to L, then the last is at L, the second last at L-1, ...)\n          read(s(L-i_digit:L-i_digit), *) digit   ! Alternatively, we can convert by: digit = ichar(s(L-i_digit:L-i_digit)) - 48\n\n          ! But using read might be overkill? We can do:\n          digit = ichar(s(L-i_digit:L-i_digit)) - 48   ! because '0' is 48 in ASCII.\n\n          do pre = 0, 12\n              new_r = mod(base * digit + pre, 13_8)\n              dp_curr(new_r) = mod(dp_curr(new_r) + dp_prev(pre), mod_val)\n          end do\n\n          base = mod(base * 10, 13_8)\n          dp_prev = dp_curr\n      end do\n\n      ans2 = dp_prev(5)   ! we want remainder 5\n\n      ! Step 4: Third program\n      ! Convert ans2 to a 4-byte integer\n      N = int(ans2, kind=4)\n\n      ! Compute n = (N+1)/2 if N is odd, else N/2\n      if (mod(N,2) == 0) then\n          n = N / 2\n      else\n          n = (N+1) / 2\n      end if\n\n      ! Initialize ans3 to sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n      ans3 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\n      ! Loop A from 1 to n\n      do A=1, n\n          temp = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N-A)\n          if (temp < ans3) then\n              ans3 = temp\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the result of the third program\n      write(*,*) ans3\n\n      contains\n\n          function sum_digits(a) result(res)\n              integer, intent(in) :: a\n              integer :: res, x\n              x = a\n              res = 0\n              do while (x >= 10)\n                  res = res + mod(x,10)\n                  x = x / 10\n              end do\n              res = res + x\n          end function sum_digits\n\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: the third program's function `sum_digits` must be defined. We defined it as an internal function.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: when N is 0 or 1? \n\n  If N=0: then in the third program, we set n = (0+1)/2? Actually, mod(0,2)==0 -> n=0. Then we skip the loop. Then the initial value: \n        ans3 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(0-1) = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(-1) \n\n  But the original Java function `sum`:\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        while (a >= 10) {\n            ans += a % 10;\n            a /= 10;\n        }\n        ans += a;\n\n  For negative numbers? The input a is nonnegative? In the chain, the third program's input N is nonnegative (from 0 to 1000000006). Then A is from 1 to n (so positive) and N-A is nonnegative? Because A<=n, and n <= (N+1)/2, so A<= (N+1)/2, then N-A >= N - (N+1)/2 = (2N - N -1)/2 = (N-1)/2. Since N>=0, then N-A>=0? Only if N>=A? But note: when N=1, then n=(1+1)/2=1. Then A=1, then N-A=0. So we have to compute sum_digits(0). \n\n  The Java function: for a=0: \n        while (0>=10) -> false, then ans=0, then add a=0 -> returns 0.\n\n  But in our function, for a=0: \n        do while (0>=10) -> false, then res = 0 + 0 = 0? Actually, no: we set x=0, then skip the loop, then res = res (which is 0) + x (which is 0) -> 0.\n\n  For a negative? The original Java program does not handle negatives? Because the input N is positive and A is from 1 to n, then N-A is nonnegative? So we are safe.\n\n  However, in the initial value: we compute sum_digits(1) and sum_digits(N-1). If N=0, then N-1=-1. The original Java function: for a=-1: \n        while (-1>=10) -> false, then add a=-1 -> returns -1.\n\n  But the chain: the second program's output is between 0 and 1000000006, so N>=0. Then N-1 is at least -1? But when N=0, then we get -1. But the second program's output is 0? Then N=0? Then we have to compute sum_digits(-1). The original Java program would return -1? So the initial value would be 1 + (-1) = 0? Then the loop from A=1 to n (n=0) doesn't run. Then the answer is 0.\n\n  But in our Fortran function, for a=-1: \n        x = -1\n        while (x>=10) -> false? then res = 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\n  So we get the same.\n\n  But note: the third program in the original Java code uses `int a` and the function `sum` for any integer? It might be negative? The problem does not specify. But in the chain, the third program's input is nonnegative? But we are using the output of the second program which is nonnegative? Then why would we get negative? Only in the initial value: when N=0, we compute N-1=-1.\n\n  But the second program's output is 0 only if the string leads to remainder 5? Actually, the second program's output is the count of numbers mod 13=5 modulo 1e9+7. It can be 0? Yes, if there is no such number.\n\n  So we must handle negative numbers in the digit sum? The original Java function does not take absolute value. So we must replicate the negative behavior.\n\n  However, the problem says to replicate the behavior. So we do the same.\n\n  But note: the digit representation for negative numbers? The modulus operation: in Java, `a % 10` for negative a is negative? For example, -1 % 10 is -1? And then -1/10 is 0? Because integer division in Java truncates toward zero? Actually, it rounds toward zero? Then the loop would break because -1/10 is 0? Then the function returns -1.\n\n  In Fortran: \n        mod(-1,10) is 9? or -1? Actually, Fortran's mod function: mod(a,p) returns a - int(a/p)*p, so for negative a, it returns a nonnegative? Actually, the standard says: mod is the remainder of a divided by p, and the sign of the remainder is the same as a? Or the same as p? Actually, the Fortran standard: mod(a,p) has the same sign as a and absolute value less than |p|. So mod(-1,10) = -1.\n\n  And integer division: -1/10 is 0? Because truncation toward zero? In Fortran, integer division truncates toward zero? Yes. So for a=-1:\n        res = 0\n        while (a>=10) -> false? \n        then add a: res = 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\n  So same as Java.\n\n  Therefore, the function is correct.\n\n  But note: the third program's initial value: if N=0, then we compute sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\n  Then the answer is 0.\n\n  If N=1: \n        n = (1+1)/2 = 1\n        initial value: sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n        then loop A=1: \n            sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(0) = 1+0=1 -> same as initial, so ans3=1.\n\n  So the program is correct.\n\n  However, we must note that the third program's loop runs from A=1 to n. When n is large (up to 500 million), it might be slow. But we do as the original.\n\n  We hope the input N for the third program is not too big? But the maximum n is about 500 million, and that loop will take time. But the problem does not require optimization.\n\n  Let's run a test? We cannot test all, but we trust the translation.\n\n  We write the entire program.\n\n  Note: in the second program, we have:\n\n      do i_digit = 0, L-1\n          ... s(L-i_digit:L-i_digit) ...\n\n  But when L=1, then i_digit=0: we take s(1:1) -> that's correct.\n\n  And when L=2, then i_digit=0: s(2:2), then i_digit=1: s(1:1). Correct.\n\n  We use 0-indexing for the digit position from the right? Actually, we are iterating the digits from the last to the first. The index in the string: the last character is at L, then L-1, etc. So for a string of length L, the positions are 1..L. Then the last digit is at L, the first at 1. Then for i_digit=0, we take the last (position L), for i_digit=1, we take position L-1, ... for i_digit = L-1, we take position 1.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n  But note: the base starts at 1 and then is updated: base = base * 10 mod 13.\n\n  We use integer(kind=8) for base? But 13 is small, so we can use 4-byte? But to avoid overflow in base * 10: 13*10=130, which fits in 4-byte. But we are using 8-byte for consistency? It doesn't matter.\n\n  We'll run and hope.\n\n  One more note: the second program uses the entire string? What if the string is empty? That is, if ans1=0, then the string is \"0\", and L=1. Then we process the digit '0'. Then the state becomes:\n\n        base=1, digit=0, pre=0: new_r = (1*0+0) mod 13 = 0 -> dp_curr(0) += 1.\n\n        Then base = 1*10 mod13 = 10.\n\n        Then we are done. Then ans2 = dp_curr(5) = 0? Actually, we set dp_prev=dp_curr at the end, and then we want dp_prev(5). But we only set state 0 to 1, and the rest 0. So dp_prev(5)=0.\n\n  Then the second program outputs 0.\n\n  Then the third program runs with N=0.\n\n  Then we compute: \n        n = 0 (if N=0: mod(0,2)=0 -> n=0)\n        initial value: sum_digits(1)+sum_digits(-1)=1+(-1)=0\n        then loop from A=1 to 0? (none) -> ans3=0.\n\n  So it outputs 0.\n\n  But the original first program: if n=1 and arr[0]=0, then ans1=0. Then the second program: the string \"0\" -> the dp: we have one digit and the remainder 0? Then we want remainder 5? 0 mod13=0, so no state 5 -> output 0. Then the third program outputs 0.\n\n  So it is consistent.\n\n  We write the code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the third program's function `sum_digits` must be defined as internal? We defined it in the contains section.\n\n  We use:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      ... [declarations] ...\n\n      ! Step 1: Read n and array\n      ... \n\n      ! Step 2: Compute ans1\n      ...\n\n      ! Step 3: Convert ans1 to string and run second program\n      ...\n\n      ! Step 4: Third program\n      ...\n\n      contains\n          function sum_digits(a) ... \n          ...\n      end program\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Note: We must use `integer(kind=8)` for the modulus and for the dp_prev and dp_curr arrays? Because the counts might be large? The modulus is 1e9+7, so we do modulo arithmetic. But the numbers are modulo 1e9+7, so they are at most 1e9+6, which fits in 4-byte? But we used 8-byte to avoid overflow in the intermediate addition: we might add up to 10 * (1e9) = 10e9, which is 10^10, which is within 8-byte. Then we mod by 1e9+7. But we can also do:\n\n        dp_curr(new_r) = mod(dp_curr(new_r) + dp_prev(pre), mod_val)\n\n  This addition might be: dp_curr(new_r) + dp_prev(pre) might be up to 2e9? Then mod_val is 1e9+7, so we can do mod after each addition? But 2e9 is less than 2^31-1? Actually, 2^31-1 is about 2.1e9, so 2e9 is acceptable? But if we have multiple additions? The dp_curr(new_r) might be added several times? Actually, for each pre, we add one term. The maximum term is dp_prev(pre) which is at most mod_val? So the addition for one new_r: at most 13 * mod_val? Because we loop pre 0..12, so we add at most 13 terms? Each term is at most mod_val? So the maximum value before mod is 13 * mod_val, which is about 13e9, which is too big for 4-byte? So we must use 8-byte for the dp arrays.\n\n  Therefore, we use 8-byte.\n\n  Final code:"
