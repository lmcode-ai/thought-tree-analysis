Input for the first program: \n            s1 = \"aba\"\n            t1 = \"ABAb\"\n\n        First program:\n            tmap: \n                'A' (65): 1 -> then becomes 2? \n                'B' (66): 1\n                'b' (98): 1? But wait: the string \"ABAb\" has: \n                    'A' (65) -> 2 times? \n                    'B' (66) -> 1 time?\n                    'b' (98) -> 1 time? So tmap[65]=2, tmap[66]=1, tmap[98]=1. First pass: \n                'a' (97): is there in tmap? no (because tmap[97]=0). 'b' (98): yes -> tmap[98] becomes 0, ura=1, and mark that position. 'a' (97): again, not found. Then s_work becomes: char(1) at the position of 'b', and the rest 'a','a'. Second pass: \n                first char: 'a' -> reverse: 'A' -> tmap[65] is 2 -> so use, opa=1, tmap[65]=1. second char: char(1) -> reverse: char(1) -> not found? third char: 'a' -> reverse: 'A' -> tmap[65]=1 -> use, opa=2, tmap[65]=0. Then ura=1, opa=2 -> output \"1 2\"\n\n        Then the second program gets the string \"1 2\" -> it reads the first token: \"1\"\n            distinct characters: only '1' -> distinct=1, and frequency=1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\"\n\n        Then the third program: replaces commas in \"No\" -> \"No\"\n\n        Output: \"No\"\n\n   But the original first program for this input? s = \"aba\" , t = \"ABAb\"\n        First pass: \n            'a' -> not found in t? (because t has 'A','B','A','b')? 'b' -> found? (because there is 'b') -> use one 'b', so t becomes: 'A','B','A' (removed the 'b')\n            then mark that position as '\u042f'. Then the string becomes: \"a\u042fa\"\n\n        Second pass: \n            first char: 'a' -> reverse: 'A' -> found in t? (there are two 'A') -> use one, so opa=1, and remove one 'A' -> t becomes: ['B','A']\n            second char: '\u042f' -> reverse: if '\u042f' is uppercase? then to lowercase: '\u044f'? which is not in t? third char: 'a' -> reverse: 'A' -> found? use one, opa=2. So ura=1, opa=2 -> output \"1 2\"\n\n        Then the second program: input \"1\" -> outputs \"No\"\n\n        Then the third program: outputs \"No\"\n\n   So we match. However, note: the first program in Java uses the reverse function on '\u042f'? and we in Fortran use the same reverse function?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The plan:\n 1. The entire sequence: \n    - The first program (codeforces_518_B) reads two strings: `s` and `t`.\n      It computes two numbers: `ura` and `opa`, and prints them as: `ura opa`.\n    - The second program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads one string and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Then prints \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n    - The third program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads one string and replaces every comma with a space.\n\n However, note the requirement: \n   - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n   - Intermediate steps without I/O.\n\n How to chain?\n   The output of the first program (two numbers: ura and opa) becomes the input to the second? \n   But the second program expects a string. Similarly, the third expects a string.\n\n But the original programs are independent? Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n However, the example programs are not chained by the user in the code. We have to design the chain.\n\n Let's see the inputs and outputs:\n\n Program 1: \n   Input: two strings (s and t)\n   Output: two integers (ura and opa) printed on the same line with a space.\n\n Program 2:\n   Input: one string (s)\n   Output: either \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n Program 3:\n   Input: one string (with commas)\n   Output: the same string with commas replaced by spaces.\n\n But the chain must be: \n   Input to the entire sequence: the same as the first program? Then the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n However, the outputs and inputs are of different types.\n\n How to reconcile?\n\n The problem states: \"the entire sequence\" meaning that the output of the first program (which is two integers) is passed as input to the second program. But the second program expects a string of length 4 (like \"AABB\")? \n\n But wait: the second program expects a single string. The output of the first program is two numbers (like \"3 4\"). So that string of two numbers (with a space) is the input to the second program? Then the second program will check: \n   Does the string (which is something like \"3 4\") have exactly two distinct characters? The string \"3 4\" has: \n      characters: '3', ' ', '4' -> three distinct characters? So it would output \"No\".\n\n Then that output string (\"No\") is passed to the third program? The third program replaces commas in that string. Since there are no commas, it outputs \"No\".\n\n However, the example programs are not designed to be chained. But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\" meaning:\n\n   We have to simulate the chain:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program on its original input (two strings) and get the output (two integers). \n   Step 2: Take the string representation of the output (the line that was printed) and use that as input to the second program.\n   Step 3: Take the output of the second program (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and use that as input to the third program.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program will:\n\n     - Read the original input for the first program: two strings (let's call them s1 and t1).\n     - Process as the first program to get two integers: ura and opa.\n     - Convert these two integers into a string: write(ura) // ' ' // write(opa)  -> but we have to format without extra spaces? Actually, we just want the numbers with a space in between.\n\n     - Then, this string (say, str1) becomes the input to the second program. The second program checks: \n            does str1 have exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice? \n        But note: the string str1 is the string representation of two numbers and a space. For example, if ura=10 and opa=20, then str1 = \"10 20\" (which is 5 characters: '1','0',' ','2','0').\n\n     - Then, the second program will set `ok` to true only if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice? \n        The example \"10 20\" has 5 characters. The distinct characters: '1','0',' ','2' -> four distinct. So it will output \"No\".\n\n     - Then, the third program takes the string \"No\" and replaces commas (there are none) and outputs \"No\".\n\n   However, this chain is not meaningful. But the problem does not specify the meaning, only that we chain the outputs to inputs.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that the three programs are independent and we run them on the same initial input? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   We must follow the chain: first program's output is second program's input, second program's output is third program's input.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program should:\n\n     Step 1: Read the input for the first program (two strings: s and t).\n\n     Step 2: Compute the two numbers (ura, opa) as in the first program.\n\n     Step 3: Format the two numbers as a string (with a space in between) to be passed to the second program.\n\n     Step 4: Using that string (call it s2) as the input to the second program, check if s2 has exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice? \n              If yes, then the second program would output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n     Step 5: Then take that output string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and replace every comma in it with a space? But note: there is no comma in \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the third program outputs the same.\n\n     Step 6: Output the string from the third program.\n\n   But note: the first program originally outputs two numbers. The second program originally reads from stdin a string (which in its standalone is a string of 4 letters). The third program originally reads a string with commas.\n\n   However, we are chaining. The input to the entire program is the same as the input to the first program: two strings.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n     - Reads two strings: the first string (call it s1) and the second string (t1) for the first program.\n\n     - Then we do:\n\n        Step A: Process s1 and t1 to compute ura and opa (as in the first Java program).\n\n        Step B: Create a string `s2` that is the concatenation of the string representation of ura, a space, and the string representation of opa.\n\n        Step C: Then, we run the second program's logic on `s2` (which is now a string of digits and space). The second program counts frequency of each character and checks:\n                - There are exactly two distinct characters? \n                - And each appears exactly twice?\n                - And the total distinct count is 2? \n                Then it sets a flag (ok) and then we set the output string for the second program as either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Let that string be `s3`.\n\n        Step D: Then, we run the third program's logic on `s3`: replace every comma in `s3` by a space. Since there is no comma, `s4 = s3`.\n\n        Step E: Output `s4`.\n\n   However, note: the third program originally reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. So we are applying that transformation to the string `s3`.\n\n   But what if the string `s3` has a comma? It won't because it's either \"Yes\" or \"No\". But we must code the replacement.\n\n   So the entire Fortran program will be:\n\n     program combined\n        implicit none\n        ! We are going to read the two strings for the first program.\n        character(len=200000) :: s1, t1  ! Allocate large enough to avoid overflow. The problem doesn't specify, but we assume.\n        character(len=400000) :: temp_str  ! For intermediate string building.\n        integer :: ura, opa\n        integer :: i, n, m, count\n        ! For the first program: we need a map for t1. We'll use an array for ASCII? But Fortran doesn't have built-in hash. We can use an array for 256 characters.\n\n        ! Step 1: Read the two strings\n        read(*,*) s1\n        read(*,*) t1\n\n        ! Trim to get actual length? But note: the Java Scanner next() reads token (without spaces). However, the problem says the first program reads two tokens? \n        ! But the example: the first program uses `scan.next()` which reads until whitespace? Actually, the example input for the first program might be two strings without spaces? \n        ! But the problem says: the entire sequence. We have to assume the input format is the same as the first program.\n\n        ! However, the first program reads two tokens: \n        !   StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder(scan.next());\n        !   String t = scan.next();\n\n        ! So we read two tokens. In Fortran, using `read(*,*)` will read tokens.\n\n        ! But note: the first string might be read including leading/trailing spaces? Actually, `read(*,*)` skips leading spaces and reads until next space.\n\n        ! How to handle? We assume the input is two tokens (each without internal spaces) for the first program.\n\n        ! However, the second program in the chain reads one string. But the output of the first program is a string that has a space? So we have to form a string that has two numbers and a space.\n\n        ! Let's compute the actual length of s1 and t1 without trailing spaces.\n        n = len_trim(s1)\n        m = len_trim(t1)\n\n        ! Step 2: First program logic.\n\n        ! We'll create an array for the frequency of characters in t1. We use 0:255 for ASCII? But note: the program uses Character which is 16-bit? But the problem uses letters? \n        ! The program also uses reverse: which toggles case. So we are dealing with upper and lower case? We'll map to 256? Actually, we can use an array of 128 or 256.\n\n        integer :: tmap(0:255)  ! We'll use 0..255 for ASCII. But note: the Java char is 16-bit? But the problem likely uses ASCII? \n        ! But the reverse function: if the character is lower case, convert to upper, and vice versa. So we need to cover the entire ASCII set? \n\n        ! However, the problem says: the input string s and t? They are likely to contain only letters? But the first program does not restrict.\n\n        ! Initialize tmap to zero.\n        tmap = 0\n\n        ! Build frequency for t1: traverse each character in t1 (only the non-blank part: from 1 to m, but we read the token so we have the string without trailing spaces? But we read with `read(*,*)` which trims? Actually, we have the entire token without leading/trailing spaces, but the variable s1 and t1 are padded with spaces to the declared length. We use the trimmed length.\n\n        do i = 1, m\n            ! Get the character at position i of t1 (without trailing spaces: but we stored in t1 and we have m = len_trim(t1))\n            ! The character is t1(i:i)\n            ! Convert to its ASCII value and use as index.\n            tmap(ichar(t1(i:i))) = tmap(ichar(t1(i:i))) + 1\n        end do\n\n        ura = 0\n        opa = 0\n\n        ! First pass: for each character in s1, if it is in tmap and count>0, then use it and remove one.\n        do i = 1, n\n            ! current character: s1(i:i)\n            character :: ch\n            ch = s1(i:i)\n            integer :: idx\n            idx = ichar(ch)\n            if (tmap(idx) > 0) then\n                ura = ura + 1\n                tmap(idx) = tmap(idx) - 1\n                ! Mark that we used this character? We don't need to remove from s1? We just mark by setting to a special character? \n                ! In the Java code, they set s.setCharAt(i, '\u042f') but we don't have the string as mutable? We don't need the s1 for the second pass? \n                ! Actually, in the Java code, they set to '\u042f' so that in the second pass they skip. We can skip by having a separate array to mark? \n                ! But the second pass uses the original string? Actually, the second pass uses the modified string (with some replaced by '\u042f'). \n                ! How to simulate? We can create a copy of s1 and then mark? \n\n                ! Instead, we'll create a logical array to mark which positions are already used? Or we can create a new string and change the character? \n                ! We don't need the original s1 for anything else? We are going to use the same s1 for the second pass? But we want to skip the positions that were used in the first pass.\n\n                ! We'll create a logical array `used` of length n, initially false.\n                ! But we haven't done that. Let's restructure: we do two passes. In the first pass, we mark the positions that we use? But note: the second pass uses the original string with some characters replaced by a special character (so that they are skipped). \n\n                ! Alternative: we can create a string s_work = s1, and then when we use a character we set that position to a special character (like the Cyrillic '\u042f')? But in Fortran, we can do that.\n\n                ! We'll create a new string: s_work = s1 (the first n characters) and then we can change it.\n\n                ! But we didn't declare s_work? We'll do it now.\n\n                ! Actually, we have to do the same as the Java code: we are going to change the string. So we declare a string for s_work.\n\n                ! Let me reorganize: we need to have a mutable copy of s1? We'll do:\n\n                character(len=n) :: s_work\n                s_work = s1(1:n)   ! copy the non-blank part? Actually, s1 is padded with spaces? But we have the exact length n.\n\n                ! But we are inside the loop? We must do this before the loop.\n\n                ! So we move the declaration and initialization outside the loop.\n\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Actually, we need to do the two passes. So we break the first program into two passes.\n\n        ! We'll declare s_work and initialize at the beginning of the first program part.\n\n        ! Revised plan for first program:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s_work   ! We'll allocate to n\n        integer :: j\n        character :: ch, rch\n\n        ! Allocate s_work to n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: s_work)\n        s_work = s1(1:n)\n\n        ! But note: we already built tmap for t1.\n\n        ! First pass: for each position in s_work (from 1 to n)\n        do i = 1, n\n            ch = s_work(i:i)\n            idx = ichar(ch)\n            if (tmap(idx) > 0) then\n                ura = ura + 1\n                tmap(idx) = tmap(idx) - 1\n                s_work(i:i) = '\u042f'   ! We use a character that is not in the original? We hope it's not in the original. But the problem says: the string is of letters? And '\u042f' is Cyrillic, so not in the typical input? \n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Second pass: for each position in s_work\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s_work(i:i) == '\u042f') cycle   ! Skip if already used? Actually, in the Java code, they don't skip by condition, they check the reverse of the character? But if we set to '\u042f', then the reverse of '\u042f' is not defined? \n\n            ! Actually, the second pass in Java does:\n            !   Character ch = s.charAt(i);\n            !   Character rch = reverse(ch);\n            !   Then checks tmap for rch.\n\n            ! But if the character is '\u042f', then we skip? Actually, the Java code sets the character to '\u042f' and then in the second pass, it will see '\u042f' and try to reverse it? \n\n            ! What is the reverse of '\u042f'? \n            !   The reverse function: if it is lowercase, convert to uppercase, else to lowercase.\n            !   '\u042f' is an uppercase Cyrillic letter? Then reverse would convert to lowercase? But we don't know if we have the lowercase in the tmap? \n\n            ! However, the problem says: the input strings s and t are composed of letters? And the reverse function only applies to letters? \n\n            ! So we can do: if the character is not a letter? then skip? But the Java code does not skip: it tries to reverse.\n\n            ! But note: the Java code does not skip the '\u042f' in the second pass? It will try to reverse it. \n\n            ! How to avoid? The Java code sets the character to '\u042f' so that it becomes a character that is not in t? But then the reverse of '\u042f' might not be in t? \n\n            ! Actually, the second pass uses the character from the string. We set it to '\u042f' so that when we get the reverse, we are looking for the reverse of '\u042f'? which is not in the original t? So the tmap won't have it? \n\n            ! Therefore, we can leave the second pass as:\n\n            ch = s_work(i:i)\n            ! We need to reverse the case? But note: the reverse function in Java: \n            !   if Character.isLowerCase(ch) -> then toUpperCase, else toLowerCase.\n\n            ! We must write a helper function for reverse.\n\n            rch = reverse(ch)\n\n            idx = ichar(rch)\n            if (tmap(idx) > 0) then\n                opa = opa + 1\n                tmap(idx) = tmap(idx) - 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        deallocate(s_work)\n\n        ! Now, we have ura and opa.\n\n        ! Step 3: Format ura and opa as a string: we write them to a string with a space in between.\n\n        ! We'll create a string `s2` that will be the input to the second program.\n        ! How long? The integers ura and opa: maximum value? The problem doesn't specify. Let's assume they are at most 6 digits? So 12+space = 13? But let's be safe: 20 characters.\n\n        character(len=20) :: s2\n        write(s2, '(I0, A, I0)') ura, ' ', opa   ! This writes without extra spaces? But note: the space is inserted.\n\n        ! But the write might have trailing spaces? We need to trim? Actually, the second program will take the entire string? But the second program uses `s = in.next()` which is a token? \n        ! However, in the chain we are passing a string that is exactly the two numbers and a space? And the second program will read the entire line? \n\n        ! But the second program in the original uses `in.next()` which reads one token? But the string we are passing has a space? Then the second program would only read the first token? \n\n        ! This is a problem. The chain: the first program outputs the two numbers with a space: so the output is a line with \"ura opa\". Then the second program reads that entire line? \n\n        ! Actually, the second program uses `String s = in.next();` which reads only the next token (until space). So it would read the first number? \n\n        ! But that breaks the chain. \n\n        ! How did the original Java programs chain? The output of the first program is a line: e.g., \"10 20\", and the second program reads the next token? Then it reads only \"10\". \n\n        ! This is inconsistent. \n\n        ! However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n        ! In a Unix pipe: \n        !   $ java Program1 | java Program2 | java Program3\n        !   The output of Program1 is a line: \"10 20\" (with a space and a newline). \n        !   Then Program2 reads from stdin: the first token from the pipe? It would read \"10\", and then the next token is \"20\", but Program2 only reads one token? \n\n        ! The second program: \n        !   String s = in.next();\n        !   Then it uses s (which is \"10\") and then the rest of the input (the \"20\") is left for the next read? But the program doesn't read more. \n\n        ! This is a problem. \n\n        ! We must simulate the pipe: the entire output of the first program (which is \"ura opa\" and a newline) is the input to the second program. The second program then reads one token? \n\n        ! Therefore, the second program will only get the first token (the ura) as the string? \n\n        ! But the second program expects a string of 4 letters? and we are giving it a string of digits? \n\n        ! This chain is not meaningful. But the problem says: we are to reproduce the same behavior as the chain.\n\n        ! So we do:\n\n        !   The second program reads the next token from the input, which is the first token of the output of the first program? \n\n        !   How to do in Fortran? We have to split the string we built (s2) into tokens? and then take the first token? \n\n        !   But wait: the second program only reads one token. So we form the string s2, then we take the first token from s2? \n\n        !   How? We can read from the string s2 as if it were a line? \n\n        !   We can do: \n        !       read(s2, *) token   ! This reads the first token from s2.\n\n        !   But the second program uses that token? \n\n        !   Therefore, the input to the second program is the first token (the string representation of ura) and the rest is ignored? \n\n        !   Then the second program checks: \n        !         token: which is the string of ura. For example, if ura=10, then token=\"10\". \n        !         The distinct characters in \"10\": \n        !            '1' -> 1, '0' -> 1 -> distinct count=2? but each appears once? so it fails.\n\n        !   Then the second program outputs \"No\".\n\n        !   Then the third program gets \"No\", replaces commas (none) and outputs \"No\".\n\n        !   So the entire program outputs \"No\".\n\n        !   But what if the first program outputs \"0 0\", then the token for the second program is \"0\", which has one distinct character? \n\n        !   So we must do:\n\n        !      Step 3a: From the string s2 (which is the two numbers and a space), extract the first token? \n\n        !   How? We can split by space? \n\n        !   Actually, we can read the first token from s2:\n\n        character(len=20) :: token\n        integer :: pos\n        pos = index(s2, ' ')\n        if (pos > 0) then\n            token = s2(1:pos-1)\n        else\n            token = s2\n        end if\n\n        ! But note: the second program expects one token. So we set the input to the second program to be `token`.\n\n        ! However, the problem says: the entire sequence. The second program is run on the output of the first, which is a string of two tokens? but the second program only reads one token? \n\n        ! So we are correct: we are simulating the second program reading only the first token.\n\n        ! Step 4: Second program logic: \n        !   Input: token (a string)\n\n        !   We need to count frequency of each character in token.\n\n        integer :: freq(0:255)   ! frequency array for ASCII\n        integer :: distinct, len_token\n        logical :: ok\n\n        freq = 0\n        len_token = len_trim(token)\n\n        do i = 1, len_token\n            idx = ichar(token(i:i))\n            freq(idx) = freq(idx) + 1\n        end do\n\n        distinct = 0\n        ok = .true.\n        do i = 0, 255\n            if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                distinct = distinct + 1\n                if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n                    ok = .false.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! The condition: if ok and distinct==2 then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n        if (ok .and. distinct == 2) then\n            token = \"Yes\"\n        else\n            token = \"No\"\n        end if\n\n        ! But note: the second program outputs a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and then the third program will take that entire string? \n\n        ! The third program reads the entire line? The original third program: \n        !   String a = br.readLine();\n        !   Then replaces commas by spaces.\n\n        ! So in the chain, the third program reads the entire output of the second program? which is one token? and then a newline? \n\n        ! But the second program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without a newline? Actually, the Java program uses System.out.println? which adds a newline). \n\n        ! How to simulate? \n        !   The third program will read the entire line: including the newline? \n\n        !   But we are not dealing with newlines? because the third program in our chain is applied to the string \"Yes\" or \"No\", without a newline? \n\n        !   Actually, the third program in the chain will read the entire output of the second program. The second program outputs a line: \"Yes\\n\" or \"No\\n\". \n\n        !   But the third program uses `br.readLine()` which reads a line (without the newline). \n\n        !   Then it replaces commas by spaces. \n\n        !   Then it outputs the result (without adding comma? but it replaces commas) and then a newline? \n\n        !   So we must simulate: the input to the third program is the string that the second program outputs (without the trailing newline? because readLine removes it). \n\n        !   But we have the string `token` which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\n        !   However, the second program in our simulation did not add a newline? because we are not writing to stdout. We are just setting `token` to \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\n        !   Then we pass `token` to the third program? \n\n        !   So we do:\n\n        !       s3 = token   (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\n        !   Step 5: Third program: replace commas in s3 by spaces.\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s4\n        integer :: len_s3\n\n        ! We'll create a string s3 that is the same as token? \n        len_s3 = len_trim(token)\n        allocate(character(len=len_s3) :: s4)\n        s4 = token(1:len_s3)   ! without trailing spaces? \n\n        ! Now, replace every comma by space.\n        do i = 1, len_s3\n            if (s4(i:i) == ',') then\n                s4(i:i) = ' '\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 6: Output s4 (with a newline? because the third program originally prints with println? and the problem says the last block should produce output)\n\n        write(*, '(A)') trim(s4)\n\n        ! But note: the third program in Java uses `System.out.println(sb)`, so it prints the string and then a newline.\n\n        ! We do: write(*, '(A)') trim(s4)   will output the string without trailing spaces and then a newline? \n\n        ! But what if the string has trailing spaces? We are trimming? \n\n        ! The third program in Java: \n        !   It reads a line (so without newline) and then replaces commas by spaces and then prints the entire string (with the same spaces) and then a newline.\n\n        ! We should not trim? \n\n        ! Actually, we allocated s4 to the exact length of the non-blank part? But we set s4 = token(1:len_s3) and then we are replacing commas. \n\n        ! The token was \"Yes\" or \"No\", which have no trailing spaces. \n\n        ! So we can do: write(*, '(A)') s4   (without trim) but s4 is allocated to the exact length (3 for \"Yes\", 2 for \"No\")? \n\n        ! But we want to output the entire string? \n\n        !   For \"Yes\": we output \"Yes\" (3 characters) and then a newline? \n\n        !   So: \n        !        write(*, '(A)') s4   will output the 3 characters and then a newline? \n\n        !   That is the same as the Java program.\n\n        ! However, what if the string has leading spaces? Our token was read from s2 and then we took the first token? which has no leading spaces? \n\n        ! So we are safe.\n\n        ! But note: what if the first token in s2 is empty? Then token would be empty? \n\n        ! Step 7: Clean up.\n\n        deallocate(s4)\n\n        !

We have implemented that.\n\n   But there is a catch: the Java program uses the reverse function on the character that might be '\u042f'? \n        In the first pass, we set some characters to '\u042f'. Then in the second pass, we try to reverse '\u042f'. \n        The ASCII value of '\u042f' is not in the range of A-Z or a-z? (because '\u042f' is Cyrillic, with code 1071 in Unicode? but we are using ASCII? \n\n   How did we represent '\u042f'? \n\n   We are using an array of 0:255 for ASCII? But '\u042f' is not in ASCII? \n\n   This is a problem. \n\n   We must use a different approach? \n\n   The original Java program uses 16-bit characters. But the problem might have non-ASCII letters? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify. \n\n   We'll assume that the input is within ASCII? and the special character '\u042f' is not in the input? \n\n   But note: we set the character to '\u042f' only to mark it as used? and then in the second pass, we skip it? Actually, we don't skip: we try to reverse it? \n\n   But if '\u042f' is not a letter, then the reverse function leaves it as is? and then we look for it in tmap? which we built from t1 (which is in ASCII? and does not contain '\u042f')? so it won't be found? \n\n   Therefore, it is safe.\n\n   But the first program uses '\u042f' as a marker? and the reverse function returns the same character? and then we check tmap for that character? which is zero? so it is skipped? \n\n   So we are effectively skipping? \n\n   However, the second pass in the Java program does not skip? it just doesn't find the reverse of '\u042f' in the tmap? \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the array tmap is for ASCII? and we are indexing by the ASCII value? but if the string contains a non-ASCII character? it will be outside 0-255? \n\n   We must extend? \n\n   The problem doesn't specify. We assume the input is within ASCII.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a larger array? but the problem says the input? We'll stick to 0:255.\n\n   But note: the reverse function: if the character is not a letter (like '\u042f'), then we leave it as is? and then we try to look it up in tmap? and it will be at an index that is beyond 255? \n\n   Actually, the ichar function in Fortran returns an integer in the range 0 to 255 for the default character? because Fortran characters are single byte? \n\n   So if we have a non-ASCII character in the input? we cannot represent it? \n\n   Therefore, we assume the input is ASCII.\n\n   We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n   There is one more issue: the first program uses a StringBuilder and then sets the character to '\u042f'. In Fortran, we set that character. But what is the ASCII value of '\u042f'? \n\n   In the Fortran character set, the character '\u042f' is not in the standard ASCII? but we can use it? \n\n   Actually, we are using the default character set? and if the compiler supports extended characters? then we can use. But to be safe, we might use a character that is in the ASCII set? but not a letter? \n\n   The Java program uses a Cyrillic letter to mark? so that it won't appear in the input. We can use, say, a character that is not printable? \n\n   But the problem says: the input strings s and t are composed of letters? \n\n   So we can use any non-letter? \n\n   But we need a character that is not going to be in the input? and that we can represent in the Fortran character set? \n\n   We can use the null character? but that might cause problems.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a character that is not a letter and not used? for example, the character with code 1? \n\n   But then the reverse function will leave it as is? and then we check the tmap for that? which is zero? so it's skipped? \n\n   So we can do:\n\n        s_work(i:i) = char(1)   ! a character that is not in the input.\n\n   Then in the second pass, when we see char(1), we skip? Actually, we don't need to skip? because the reverse function will leave it as char(1)? and then we check tmap for char(1)? which is zero? so it does nothing? \n\n   But we want to skip the positions that were used in the first pass? \n\n   We can skip explicitly? \n\n        if (s_work(i:i) == char(1)) cycle\n\n   But the Java code does not skip? it just doesn't find the reverse of char(1) in the tmap? \n\n   So we can do either. \n\n   We'll choose to set to char(1) and then in the second pass, we don't skip? because it won't be found? \n\n   But note: the second pass might use a character that is not in the tmap? so it's safe.\n\n   We'll change:\n\n        s_work(i:i) = char(1)\n\n   and then in the second pass, we do nothing special? \n\n   Alternatively, we can skip to be more efficient? \n\n   We'll do without skip? because it's the same as the Java.\n\n   So the program:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        ! ...
