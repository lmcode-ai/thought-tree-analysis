Then we only run for i=1,2,3. We don't set output1 in the loop? Then we break the loop without setting? Actually, we set output1 to '1' initially, but that is the desired output? However, the original program: \n            for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {\n                if (c[i]=='1') {\n                    if (i==k-1) {   // note: k-1 because i is 0-indexed, so when i=k-1, that is the k-th character (0-indexed index k-1) -> the last iteration?\n                        ... \n                    }\n                } else ...\n            } In the example: k=100, string=\"111\". Then the loop runs for i=0,1,2 (which are the indices of the string). Then at i=2 (which is the last character) and k=100, then i ! = k-1 (because k-1 is 99). So we just continue until the loop ends without breaking? Then the program ends without output? Actually, the original program does not output anything in that case? But the original program has a loop that runs k times, and if k is 100 and the string length is 3, then when i=3? The loop condition is i<100 -> true, then it accesses c[3] which is out of bounds -> exception. Therefore, we must assume that k is at most the length of the string.

We are not required to mimic the exception message? We just need the same output for valid inputs? And for invalid, we crash.

Because the problem says the chain runs. So we assume k<=n. Step 3: The second program: Input: the string output1 (which is a single character? But the second program expects a string? And it replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". However, our output1 is a single character. So the string is of length 1. The second program: \n            s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n        Since the string is one character, there is no \"BC\". So we can skip the replacement? Then the second program counts:\n            tmp = 0\n            for each char in s:\n                if char=='A' -> tmp++\n                else if char=='D' -> cnt += tmp\n                else -> tmp=0\n\n        For our one-character string:\n            if output1 is 'A': then tmp=1, then at the end, cnt=0? Then output2 = 0. if output1 is 'D': then we do cnt += tmp (which is 0) -> cnt=0? Then output2=0. if output1 is something else: then tmp=0 and remains 0 -> output2=0. But wait: what if output1 is 'B'? Then the second program sets tmp=0? Then output2=0.",

Then we run the counting algorithm on a string of length 1. Therefore, the second program will always output 0? Why? Because we never see an 'A' followed by a 'D'? We only have one character. But if the character is 'A', then we set tmp=1, but then we don't see a 'D'? Then we finish and output cnt=0. So the second program always outputs 0? That seems odd. But that's what the code does for a single character. Therefore, the third program will get the string \"0\". Then the third program: \n            It counts the frequency of the characters in \"0\": \n                one '0' -> oddCount = 1.

So the entire chain, for any input that leads to a valid k, outputs \"First\"? But wait, let me test with an example :\n\n          Example: \n            Input to first program: \"1A 2\"\n            Then k=2, and the string is \"1A\". The first program:\n                i=0: character '1' -> then if i==k-1? k-1=1? no -> continue. i=1: character 'A' -> non-'1', so it prints 'A' and exits. Then the second program gets \"A\". It replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" -> still \"A\". Then it iterates:\n                    i=0: char='A' -> tmp=1. Then the string ends -> cnt=0? So outputs 0. Then the third program gets \"0\". It counts: one '0' -> oddCount=1 -> prints \"First\". Another example: \n            Input: \"111 2\"\n            Then the first program:\n                i=0: '1' -> continue (since i=0 ! =1 (k-1=1? but k=2 -> k-1=1, so at i=1 we check)\n                i=1: '1' -> and i==1? which is k-1? (in Java: i=1 and k=2 -> i==k-1 -> true) -> then it prints 1 and exits. So the second program gets the string \"1\". Then: \n                  s = \"1\" -> replace \"BC\" -> \"1\"\n                  then iterate: \n                      char='1' -> not 'A', not 'D' -> set tmp=0. cnt=0 -> output 0. Then the third program: gets \"0\" -> outputs \"First\". Another example: \n            Input: \"A1 1\"\n            Then k=1 -> the first program:\n                i=0: character 'A' -> non-'1', so output1='A'\n\n            Then second program: \n                s = \"A\" -> tmp=1, then end -> cnt=0 -> output2=0. Third program: \"0\" -> \"First\". And if we have a longer string?",

But in our case, the string is one character, so we skip the two-character check and just append the character. Then we run the counting algorithm on new_string. Then output2 = the count. But we know that new_string is the same as the original? because we had no \"BC\". Then we run the counting:\n\n          cnt = 0\n          tmp = 0\n          do i=1, len(new_string) if (new_string(i:i)=='A') then\n                 tmp = tmp+1\n             else if (new_string(i:i)=='D') then\n                 cnt = cnt + tmp\n             else\n                 tmp = 0\n             end if\n          end do\n\n        Then output2 = cnt. Then we convert output2 to a string for the third program. Then the third program: \n            counts the frequency of each character in that string (which is the string representation of output2). But we know output2=0? So the string is \"0\". So we can skip the second step and set output2=0? But to be faithful, we write the code for the second step.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads a string and a long integer `k`. It then processes the string until it finds a character that is not '1' or until it has processed `k` characters. If it finds a non-'1' within the first `k` characters, it prints that character and exits. If it doesn't, and if the k-th character is reached (which must be a '1'), it prints 1.\n\n However, note that the entire chain: \n   - The output of the first program becomes the input for the second.\n   - The output of the second becomes the input for the third.\n\n But the first program does not always output a string? Actually, it outputs either a single digit (as a character) or the number 1 (as an integer) and then exits. However, the second program expects a string. \n\n Let's analyze the outputs:\n\n Program 1: \n   - It outputs either a single character (if it finds a non-'1' within the first k characters) or the integer 1 (if the first k-1 characters are '1' and the k-th is also '1', or if k is 1 and the first is '1').\n\n However, note: the second program expects a string. So the output of the first program must be a string. But in the first program, if we output the integer 1, that would be the string \"1\".\n\n But wait: the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program outputs a string. How is that achieved?\n   - In the first program, if it finds a non-'1', it prints that character (e.g., '2') and returns. Otherwise, when it finishes the loop (meaning the first k characters are all '1'), then after the loop, it doesn't output anything? Actually, the loop runs for i in [0, k-1]. If it goes through the entire loop without breaking, then it doesn't output anything? \n\n But wait: the first program has a condition in the loop: \n      if (c[i] == '1') {\n          if (i == k-1) {\n              System.out.println(1);\n              return;\n          }\n      } else {\n          System.out.println(c[i]);\n          return;\n      }\n\n So if at the i-th character (0-indexed) we have:\n   - If it is '1' and we are at the last index (i = k-1), then we print 1 and return.\n   - If it is not '1', we print that character and return.\n\n Therefore, the first program always prints a string (either a single character or the digit '1' as a string) and then exits.\n\n However, note that the second program uses `in.next()` which reads a token. The first program outputs a single token (one line). So the second program gets that token.\n\n But the second program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts the number of \"A\"s and then when it sees a \"D\" it adds the current count of consecutive A's (and resets on non-A, non-D? Actually, it resets on non-A and non-D? The code says: \n        if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') -> tmp++\n        else if (s.charAt(i) == 'D') -> cnt += tmp\n        else -> tmp = 0\n\n So the second program outputs a long integer (the count) as a string? Actually, it does `out.println(cnt);` which is a number. Then the third program reads a string (the entire line) and processes it.\n\n However, the third program counts the frequency of each character and then checks the number of odd frequencies to decide whether to print \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n But note: the second program outputs a number. The third program then reads that number as a string? For example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program will process the string \"5\". \n\n Now, the chain of data:\n\n   Input to the first program: a string and a long integer k.\n\n   Output of the first program: a string (one character or the digit '1').\n\n   Input to the second program: the output string from the first program.\n\n   Output of the second program: a string representation of a long integer (the count).\n\n   Input to the third program: the output string from the second program.\n\n   Output of the third program: either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n However, the original chain of programs would be:\n\n   $ echo \"SOME_INPUT_STRING\" | java atcoder_ABC106_C | java atcoder_AGC034_B | java codeforces_276_B\n\n But note: the first program actually takes two inputs: a string and a long integer. How is that provided?\n\n The input format for the first program: \n        String str = sc.next();\n        long k = sc.nextLong();\n\n So the input is: \n        <string> <space> <long>\n\n For example: \"1324 3\"\n\n The second program then gets the output of the first program (say, the character '3' for the above example) as its input string.\n\n The third program then gets the output of the second program (which is a number, say 0) as a string.\n\n But the third program then processes that string (which is \"0\") and counts the frequency of the characters? In this case, only the character '0' -> one occurrence (odd) -> oddCount=1 -> prints \"First\".\n\n How to combine:\n\n We must do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input: a string and a long integer.\n\n   Step 2: Process the first program: \n        Let s1 = the input string, and k = the input long.\n        Traverse the first k characters of s1 (if k is greater than the length, then we traverse the entire string? But note the condition: the loop runs for i from 0 to k-1, and if k is greater than the length, we might get an array index out of bounds? Actually, the first program does not check for the length? \n\n        Let me see: the first program uses `c = str.toCharArray()` and then runs `for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)`. If k is greater than the length of the string, then we will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\n        Therefore, we assume k is at most the length of the string? The problem does not specify, but we must replicate the behavior.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", so the input to the first program must be such that k is at most the length of the string? Or we must handle k > n? \n\n        The original Java program does not check for k > n. It would crash. So we assume k <= n? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically\". So we must crash? Or the problem expects valid inputs? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we assume the inputs are valid (k <= length of the string). \n\n        So we do:\n\n          character :: c\n          integer :: i\n          do i = 1, min(k, len(s1))   ... but note: k is a long, but in Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for k.\n\n          Actually, the first program breaks when it finds a non-'1'. So we can break early.\n\n        Steps for the first program:\n\n          Let output1 = '1'   (default, but we might change)\n          Do i = 1, min(k, len(s1))\n             if s1(i:i) == '1' then\n                 if i == k then   ! because k is the last index we are going to check (i from 1 to k, so when i==k, we break and output '1')\n                     output1 = '1'\n                     exit\n                 else\n                     cycle   ! continue to next\n                 end if\n             else\n                 output1 = s1(i:i)\n                 exit\n             end if\n          End Do\n\n        But note: the original Java program uses 0-indexing. We are using 1-indexing in Fortran.\n\n        However, if k is 0? The loop doesn't run? Then we have no output? But the problem says k is a long and the input is valid? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the output of the first program\" must be a string. We have to produce one.\n\n        How about: if k==0? Then the loop doesn't run, and we don't set output1? We must handle.\n\n        The original Java program: the loop runs for i from 0 to k-1. If k==0, then the loop condition (i<k) fails -> no iteration. Then the program ends without printing? But that's not the case because the problem says the chain must be followed.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify k==0. We assume k>=1.\n\n        Since the problem states the behavior of the original chain, we assume k>=1.\n\n        So we set:\n\n          output1 = '1'   ! default: if we complete the loop without finding a non-'1', then output1 is set to '1'. But note: if we break because we found a non-'1', then output1 is set to that non-'1'. If we break because we reached the k-th character and it is '1', then we set output1='1'.\n\n        However, what if k is greater than the length? We must avoid accessing beyond the string. So we break when i exceeds the length? \n\n        But the original Java program would crash. So we do:\n\n          We must not exceed the length. Therefore, we break the loop when i > len(s1) and then if we haven't set output1 (meaning we didn't break by finding a non-'1') and we broke because i reached the end of the string? Then we must set output1 to the last character? Actually, no: the original program would crash. So we assume k <= len(s1).\n\n        So we do:\n\n          output1 = '1'   ! default value, but we will set it in the loop if we find a non-'1' or at the k-th step.\n\n          do i = 1, min(k, len(s1))\n             if (s1(i:i) == '1') then\n                 if (i == k) then\n                     output1 = '1'\n                     exit   ! we break and output1 is set to '1'\n                 else\n                     ! continue\n                 end if\n             else\n                 output1 = s1(i:i)\n                 exit\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          But what if k is 100 and the string is \"111\" (length=3)? Then we only run for i=1,2,3. We don't set output1 in the loop? Then we break the loop without setting? Actually, we set output1 to '1' initially, but that is the desired output? \n\n          However, the original program: \n            for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {\n                if (c[i]=='1') {\n                    if (i==k-1) {   // note: k-1 because i is 0-indexed, so when i=k-1, that is the k-th character (0-indexed index k-1) -> the last iteration?\n                        ... \n                    }\n                } else ...\n            }\n\n          In the example: k=100, string=\"111\". Then the loop runs for i=0,1,2 (which are the indices of the string). Then at i=2 (which is the last character) and k=100, then i != k-1 (because k-1 is 99). So we just continue until the loop ends without breaking? Then the program ends without output? \n\n          Actually, the original program does not output anything in that case? \n\n          But the original program has a loop that runs k times, and if k is 100 and the string length is 3, then when i=3? The loop condition is i<100 -> true, then it accesses c[3] which is out of bounds -> exception.\n\n          Therefore, we must assume that k is at most the length of the string.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          n = len(s1)\n          if (k > n) then\n              ! This is an error? But the problem says the chain runs on the same input. So we assume k<=n.\n              ! Since we cannot crash in Fortran? We have to mimic? Actually, we are to reproduce the same behavior.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify. We assume valid inputs (k<=n).\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          output1 = s1(k:k)   ! in case we don't break earlier? Actually, we break when we find a non-'1'. But if we don't, then at the k-th character we set output1 to '1'. But what if k is beyond the length? We don't allow.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          do i = 1, k   ! but k might be too big? So we assume k<=n, and we have checked the input.\n\n          How to enforce k<=n? We assume the input.\n\n        So step 1: read the string and k. Then we check the length of the string. If k>len(s1), we set k = len(s1) to avoid crash? But the original program crashes. We are not allowed to change behavior.\n\n        We must crash? Fortran does not have exceptions. We can stop with an error message? But the original Java program crashes. We can do:\n\n          if (k > len(s1)) then\n              print *, \"Array index out of bounds\"\n              stop\n          end if\n\n        But the problem says: behave identically. The original program crashes with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. We can do:\n\n          We are going to run a loop from 1 to k. If k>len(s1), then when i=len(s1)+1, we try to access s1(i:i) -> that is undefined behavior? Or Fortran will crash? \n\n        To be safe, we can check and crash:\n\n          if (k > len(s1)) then\n              ! We can write an error and stop?\n              write(*,*) 'Index out of bounds'\n              stop\n          end if\n\n        But the problem says the chain runs on the same input. So if the input is invalid, we crash. Otherwise, we proceed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem says \"the same input\", so we assume valid input. Let's skip the check and hope k<=n? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we will check and crash if k>len(s1).\n\n        So:\n\n          Step 1: Read the string and k.\n          Step 2: Check if k > len(string). If yes, crash (by accessing an array out of bounds? Or we can stop with an error). But Fortran doesn't throw exceptions. We can do:\n\n             if (k > len(string)) then\n                 print *, \"Array index out of bounds\"\n                 stop\n             end if\n\n        But the original Java program throws an exception. We are not required to mimic the exception message? We just need the same output for valid inputs? And for invalid, we crash. So we can do:\n\n          We assume k <= len(string) and proceed without check? Because the problem says \"when run on the same input\", meaning valid input. \n\n        Let's proceed without the check? Because the problem says the chain runs. So we assume k<=n.\n\n   Step 3: The second program: \n        Input: the string output1 (which is a single character? But the second program expects a string? And it replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". However, our output1 is a single character. So the string is of length 1.\n\n        The second program: \n            s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n        Since the string is one character, there is no \"BC\". So we can skip the replacement? \n\n        Then the second program counts:\n            tmp = 0\n            for each char in s:\n                if char=='A' -> tmp++\n                else if char=='D' -> cnt += tmp\n                else -> tmp=0\n\n        For our one-character string:\n            if output1 is 'A': then tmp=1, then at the end, cnt=0? Then output2 = 0.\n            if output1 is 'D': then we do cnt += tmp (which is 0) -> cnt=0? Then output2=0.\n            if output1 is something else: then tmp=0 and remains 0 -> output2=0.\n\n        But wait: what if output1 is 'B'? Then the second program sets tmp=0? Then output2=0.\n\n        However, the first program only outputs either a digit (which is between '1' and '9') or the character '1'. Actually, the first program outputs a character from the input string. The input string can be any non-space string? \n\n        The first program reads a string and k. The string can contain any characters? Then the first program outputs a character from that string (if non-'1' is found) or the digit '1' (as a string).\n\n        So the output1 can be any character? \n\n        But note: the second program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". Since the string we are passing is of length 1, there is no \"BC\". So we don't do any replacement.\n\n        Then we run the counting algorithm on a string of length 1.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will always output 0? \n\n        Why? Because we never see an 'A' followed by a 'D'? We only have one character. \n\n        But if the character is 'A', then we set tmp=1, but then we don't see a 'D'? Then we finish and output cnt=0.\n\n        So the second program always outputs 0? \n\n        That seems odd. But that's what the code does for a single character.\n\n        Therefore, the third program will get the string \"0\".\n\n        Then the third program: \n            It counts the frequency of the characters in \"0\": \n                one '0' -> oddCount = 1.\n            Then: \n                if oddCount<=1 or oddCount %2 !=0 -> print \"First\"\n                else print \"Second\"\n\n            Since oddCount=1, it prints \"First\".\n\n        So the entire chain, for any input that leads to a valid k, outputs \"First\"? \n\n        But wait, let me test with an example:\n\n          Example: \n            Input to first program: \"1A 2\"\n            Then k=2, and the string is \"1A\".\n\n            The first program:\n                i=0: character '1' -> then if i==k-1? k-1=1? no -> continue.\n                i=1: character 'A' -> non-'1', so it prints 'A' and exits.\n\n            Then the second program gets \"A\". \n                It replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" -> still \"A\".\n                Then it iterates:\n                    i=0: char='A' -> tmp=1.\n                Then the string ends -> cnt=0? So outputs 0.\n\n            Then the third program gets \"0\". \n                It counts: one '0' -> oddCount=1 -> prints \"First\".\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"111 2\"\n            Then the first program:\n                i=0: '1' -> continue (since i=0 !=1 (k-1=1? but k=2 -> k-1=1, so at i=1 we check)\n                i=1: '1' -> and i==1? which is k-1? (in Java: i=1 and k=2 -> i==k-1 -> true) -> then it prints 1 and exits.\n\n            So the second program gets the string \"1\".\n                Then: \n                  s = \"1\" -> replace \"BC\" -> \"1\"\n                  then iterate: \n                      char='1' -> not 'A', not 'D' -> set tmp=0.\n                  cnt=0 -> output 0.\n\n            Then the third program: gets \"0\" -> outputs \"First\".\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"A1 1\"\n            Then k=1 -> the first program:\n                i=0: character 'A' -> non-'1', so output1='A'\n\n            Then second program: \n                s = \"A\" -> tmp=1, then end -> cnt=0 -> output2=0.\n\n            Third program: \"0\" -> \"First\".\n\n        And if we have a longer string? Actually, the first program only outputs one character. So the second program always gets a string of length 1. Therefore, the second program always outputs 0. The third program always gets \"0\" and outputs \"First\".\n\n        But wait, what if the first program outputs a multi-digit number? \n\n        Actually, the first program only outputs one character. Because:\n          - If it finds a non-'1', it outputs one character (the first non-'1' encountered in the first k characters).\n          - If it doesn't, it outputs the integer 1? But note: it does `System.out.println(1);` which is the string \"1\" (which is one character).\n\n        Therefore, the second program always gets a string of length 1.\n\n        So the entire chain always outputs \"First\".\n\n        That seems odd. But that is what the chain does.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n          Program:\n\n            Read the initial string and k.\n\n            Check that k is at most the length of the string? (to avoid crash) -> if k>len(string), we crash? But the problem says same input, so we assume valid.\n\n            Then we traverse the first k characters of the string until we find a non-'1' or until we reach the k-th character.\n\n            Then we set output1 to either the non-'1' we found or to '1' if we reached the k-th character and it was '1' (or if we broke on a non-'1' earlier?).\n\n            Then we pass output1 (a single character) to the second step.\n\n            The second step: \n                We don't need to replace \"BC\" because the string is one character. \n                Then we set:\n                    cnt = 0\n                    tmp = 0\n                    for i=1 to len(output1) [which is 1]:\n                         if char == 'A' -> tmp = tmp+1\n                         else if char == 'D' -> cnt = cnt + tmp\n                         else -> tmp = 0\n\n                Then output2 = cnt (which is 0).\n\n            Then the third step: \n                We have the string representation of output2 (which is 0) -> we convert 0 to a string? Actually, we are going to store output2 as an integer and then convert to string for the third program? Or we can just use the integer 0 and then in the third step we use the string \"0\".\n\n            The third step: \n                We count the frequency of each character in the string \"0\". \n                We have one character '0' -> frequency 1 -> oddCount=1.\n                Then we check: \n                    if (oddCount<=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)/=0) -> print \"First\"\n                    else -> print \"Second\"\n\n            But note: the condition in the third program: \n                if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> \"First\"\n                else -> \"Second\"\n\n                Since 1<=1 -> true -> \"First\"\n\n            Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"First\".\n\n        But wait, what if the first program outputs a multi-character string? \n\n        Actually, the first program always outputs one character. So the chain always produces \"First\".\n\n        However, this seems too simplistic. Let me double check the second program: \n\n          The second program is designed for a string of arbitrary length. But we are passing a string of length 1. \n\n          So the algorithm for the second program:\n\n            s = input string (one char)\n            tmp = 0\n            for i=0 to s.length()-1:\n                if s[i]=='A': tmp++\n                else if s[i]=='D': cnt += tmp\n                else: tmp=0\n\n            For a string of one char:\n                if char is 'A': then tmp becomes 1, then the loop ends -> cnt=0.\n                if char is 'D': then we do cnt += tmp (which is 0) -> cnt=0.\n                if char is anything else: tmp becomes 0 -> cnt=0.\n\n          So the second program always outputs 0.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"First\".\n\n        But wait: what if the first program outputs a string of more than one character? \n\n        Actually, the first program only outputs one character. It uses `System.out.println(c[i])` or `System.out.println(1)`, which outputs one line with one character (or the digit '1' as a string of length 1). \n\n        Therefore, we can write the Fortran program as:\n\n          program main\n            implicit none\n\n            ! Step 1: read the initial string and k\n            character(len=100) :: s1   ! assuming max length 100? but we don't know. We can use allocatable? Or a large fixed size.\n            integer(kind=8) :: k       ! because k is long in Java\n            character(len=1) :: output1\n            integer :: n, i, ios\n            integer :: output2\n            character(len=20) :: output2_str   ! to hold the string representation of output2\n            character(len=100) :: s3   ! for the third program: the input string (which is the string representation of output2)\n            integer :: freq(0:255)     ! for the third program: frequency of characters? We'll use ASCII\n            integer :: oddCount, j\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: temp_str\n\n            ! Read the first token (the string) and then k\n            read(*,*) s1, k\n\n            ! Get the actual length of s1 (without trailing spaces)\n            n = len_trim(s1)\n\n            ! Check: k must be <= n, if not, we crash? Or we set to n? But the original program crashes. We'll check and crash if k>n.\n            if (k > n) then\n                ! We try to access s1 at position k -> which is beyond, so we crash by accessing an invalid index?\n                ! We can write to an unit that doesn't exist? Or stop with error.\n                write(*,*) 'Array index out of bounds'\n                stop\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 1: traverse the first k characters\n            output1 = '1'   ! default\n            do i = 1, k\n                if (s1(i:i) == '1') then\n                    if (i == k) then\n                        output1 = '1'\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                else\n                    output1 = s1(i:i)\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Now, the second program: \n            !   input string = output1 (which is a single character)\n            !   we don't need to replace \"BC\" because there is none.\n\n            output2 = 0\n            ! We are going to process the string of output1 (which is one char)\n            if (output1 == 'A') then\n                ! We set tmp? But we don't have a following 'D'. So we just set tmp=1 and then don't add to cnt.\n                ! Actually, we don't need tmp? We only care about output2.\n                ! We simulate the loop for one char:\n                !   i=1: char = 'A' -> we set tmp=1 (but we don't use it for cnt) -> then output2 remains 0.\n            else if (output1 == 'D') then\n                ! Then we do: cnt += tmp (which is 0) -> output2=0.\n            else\n                ! set tmp=0 -> output2=0.\n            end if\n\n            ! So output2 = 0\n\n            ! Now, we convert output2 (0) to a string for the third program.\n            write(output2_str, '(I0)') output2   ! this writes the integer without extra spaces\n\n            ! Now, the third program: \n            !   input string = output2_str\n            s3 = trim(output2_str)   ! we'll use s3 for the string\n\n            ! Initialize frequency array\n            freq = 0\n\n            ! Traverse the string and count frequencies\n            n = len_trim(s3)\n            do i = 1, n\n                j = ichar(s3(i:i))\n                freq(j) = freq(j) + 1\n            end do\n\n            oddCount = 0\n            do i = 0, 255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n                        oddCount = oddCount + 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n                write(*,*) 'First'\n            else\n                write(*,*) 'Second'\n            end if\n\n          end program\n\n        However, note: the condition in the third program: \n            if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) -> \"First\"\n\n            This condition is always true? \n                - If oddCount<=1: true -> then \"First\"\n                - If oddCount>1: then we check mod(oddCount,2) /=0 -> if oddCount is even? then false -> \"Second\", if oddCount is odd? then true -> \"First\"\n\n            Actually, the condition is: \n                (oddCount<=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2)/=0)\n\n            Which is true unless oddCount is an even number greater than 1.\n\n            But note: the condition in the original Java code:\n\n                if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n                    writer.println(\"First\");\n                } else {\n                    writer.println(\"Second\");\n                }\n\n            So it is \"First\" if oddCount<=1 OR oddCount is odd.\n\n            But in our case, the string is \"0\", which has one distinct character (and one occurrence) -> oddCount=1 -> condition true -> \"First\".\n\n        But what if the second program output a number that has multiple digits? \n\n        Actually, the second program always outputs 0? So it is always one digit? \n\n        But wait: what if the second program outputs a number that is more than one digit? \n\n        In our chain, the second program gets a one-character string and always outputs 0. So it is one digit.\n\n        Therefore, the string for the third program is always \"0\", which is one character.\n\n        But note: the second program in the original chain is designed for arbitrary strings. In our chain, we are only passing one character. But what if we had a longer output from the first program? \n\n        Actually, the first program only outputs one character. So we are safe.\n\n        However, to be generic, we note that the first program outputs a string that can be of any length? But the problem states: the first program outputs a single character? Actually, it outputs:\n\n          - If it finds a non-'1' at position i (0-indexed), it outputs the string of that single character? \n          - Otherwise, it outputs the string \"1\".\n\n        So the output of the first program is always a string of length 1.\n\n        Therefore, the second program always gets a string of length 1 and outputs the integer 0.\n\n        Therefore, the third program always gets the string \"0\".\n\n        So we can hardcode? \n\n        But to be faithful to the chain, we write the steps.\n\n        However, we can simplify the second step: we know the string is one char, so we know output2=0.\n\n        But to be general, we write the algorithm for the second step for a string of arbitrary length? \n\n        Why? Because the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". But the chain always passes a one-char string? \n\n        But note: the first program might output a string of length 1, but the second program's algorithm is designed for any string. We should write the general algorithm? \n\n        However, the second program in the original code replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". So we must do that? \n\n        But the input to the second program is one character. There is no \"BC\". So we can skip? \n\n        But to be safe, we write the second step as:\n\n          ! Replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in the string output1? \n          ! But output1 is one character -> no replacement.\n\n          Then we run the counting algorithm.\n\n        But we can note: the string is short (one character). We can do:\n\n          temp_str = output1   ! which is one char\n\n          Then we run the counting algorithm on temp_str.\n\n        How to replace \"BC\" in a string? \n\n          The original Java: s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\n          We must replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". But note: the string might be long? But in our case, it is one char. But to be generic, we do:\n\n          We can traverse the string and build a new string? \n\n          Since the string is short, we can do:\n\n            s2 = trim(output1)   ! but output1 is one char, so we don't have \"BC\". \n\n          However, if the first program output a string of multiple characters? \n\n          But it doesn't. So we can skip.\n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must do the replacement? \n\n        So let's do:\n\n          We are going to build a new string by replacing every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". \n\n          How? We can traverse the original string and when we see a 'B' followed by a 'C', we replace by 'D' and skip the next? \n\n          But note: the input string for the second program is the output of the first program, which is one character. So we don't have two characters. \n\n          We can write a function to replace all occurrences of \"BC\" by \"D\". \n\n        However, to keep the program simple and since the string is short, we can do:\n\n          We'll create a new string by scanning the input string (which is the output1, but note: the first program outputs a string of one character, but we stored it as a character. Actually, we stored output1 as a character. But the second program expects a string? \n\n          We should have stored the output of the first program as a string? \n\n          How did we store? We stored as a character. Then we can convert to a string of length 1.\n\n        So:\n\n          Let s2 = output1   (a character) -> we can make a string: \n             str2 = output1   ! but we need to form a string variable.\n\n          Actually, we can declare:\n\n             character(len=:), allocatable :: str2\n\n          Then we set: \n             str2 = output1   ! but output1 is a scalar character -> we can assign to a string of length 1.\n\n          Then we replace \"BC\" in str2? \n\n          Since str2 is one character, we don't have \"BC\". Then we proceed.\n\n        But what if the first program output a string that might be longer? \n\n        Actually, the first program outputs a string of length 1. So we are safe.\n\n        But to be generic, we note: the first program outputs a string that is either one character (if we break on a non-'1') or the string \"1\" (which is one character). \n\n        Therefore, we can represent the output of the first program as a string of length 1.\n\n        Now, the second program: \n\n          We are going to replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in the entire string? \n\n          How? We can do:\n\n            We traverse the string and build a new string. We cannot do in-place because we are replacing two characters by one.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            new_string = ''\n            i = 1\n            do while (i <= len(str2))\n                if (i < len(str2)) then   ! at least two characters\n                    if (str2(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                        new_string = new_string // 'D'\n                        i = i+2\n                    else\n                        new_string = new_string // str2(i:i)\n                        i = i+1\n                    end if\n                else\n                    new_string = new_string // str2(i:i)\n                    i = i+1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n          Then we use new_string for the counting.\n\n        But in our case, the string is one character, so we skip the two-character check and just append the character.\n\n        Then we run the counting algorithm on new_string.\n\n        Then output2 = the count.\n\n        But we know that new_string is the same as the original? because we had no \"BC\". \n\n        Then we run the counting:\n\n          cnt = 0\n          tmp = 0\n          do i=1, len(new_string)\n             if (new_string(i:i)=='A') then\n                 tmp = tmp+1\n             else if (new_string(i:i)=='D') then\n                 cnt = cnt + tmp\n             else\n                 tmp = 0\n             end if\n          end do\n\n        Then output2 = cnt.\n\n        Then we convert output2 to a string for the third program.\n\n        Then the third program: \n            counts the frequency of each character in that string (which is the string representation of output2).\n\n        But we know output2=0? So the string is \"0\". \n\n        So we can skip the second step and set output2=0? \n\n        But to be faithful, we write the code for the second step.\n\n        However, note: the second step might be more complex if the first program output a longer string? But the first program doesn't.\n\n        So we write:\n\n          ! For the second step: \n          !   str2: the output of the first program (as a string of length 1) -> we can define:\n          character(len=:), allocatable :: str2, new_str\n          integer :: tmp_cnt, len_new, pos\n\n          str2 = output1   ! now str2 is a string of length 1\n\n          ! Build new_str by replacing \"BC\" with \"D\"\n          new_str = ''\n          i = 1\n          do while (i <= len(str2))\n              if (i <= len(str2)-1) then   ! we have at least two characters from i\n                  if (str2(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n                      new_str = new_str // 'D'\n                      i = i+2\n                  else\n                      new_str = new_str // str2(i:i)\n                      i = i+1\n                  end if\n              else\n                  new_str = new_str // str2(i:i)\n                  i = i+1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Now, count the operations\n          tmp_cnt = 0\n          output2 = 0\n          do i = 1, len(new_str)\n              if (new_str(i:i) == 'A') then\n                  tmp_cnt = tmp_cnt + 1\n              else if (new_str(i:i) == 'D') then\n                  output2 = output2 + tmp_cnt\n              else\n                  tmp_cnt = 0\n              end if\n          end do\n\n        Then we convert output2 to a string.\n\n        But note: the string new_str is the same as str2? because we had no \"BC\". So the counting will be as described.\n\n        Therefore, we write the program accordingly.\n\n        However, the entire chain always outputs \"First\", so we could simply write:\n\n          program main\n            print *, 'First'\n          end program\n\n        But that would be cheating? We are to translate the entire sequence.\n\n        Therefore, we write the steps.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        We assume the input string for the first program has at most 100 characters? \n\n        We'll use:\n\n          character(len=100) :: s1, s3, output2_str\n          character(len=1) :: output1\n          character(len=:), allocatable :: str2, new_str   ! for the second step\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read s1 and k. s1 is read as a string, and we use trim to remove trailing spaces.\n\n          2. Check k <= len_trim(s1), else crash.\n\n          3. Process s1 to get output1 (a single character).\n\n          4. Set str2 = output1 (as a string of length 1).\n\n          5. Replace \"BC\" in str2 to get new_str.\n\n          6. Count in new_str to get output2.\n\n          7. Convert output2 to a string: output2_str (with a format I0)\n\n          8. For the third program: \n                Count frequency of each character in output2_str.\n                Compute oddCount = number of characters that have odd frequency.\n\n          9. If (oddCount<=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2)/=0) then print \"First\" else print \"Second\"\n\n        We write accordingly.\n\n        Note: The third program uses the entire string (including spaces?) but we use trim? The original Java program uses `in.next()` for the first two? Actually, the first program: `sc.next()` -> reads a token. The second program: `in.next()` -> token. The third program: `bufferedReader.readLine()` -> entire line? \n\n        But the first two programs output a single token (without spaces). The third program reads a line? \n\n        However, the output of the second program is a number printed by `out.println(cnt);` -> that is a line.\n\n        So the third program reads a line? \n\n        But in our chain, the output of the second program is a single token (the number 0) and then a newline. The third program then reads the entire line? It will read \"0\".\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs a token (without space) and a newline.\n\n        We are writing the entire chain without I/O in the middle. So we are passing data via variables.\n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        Let's write the Fortran program.\n\n        Note: We must use a sufficiently large character length for the string representations? \n\n        For the second program: the input is one character, the output (output2) is an integer that can be large? But in our case, it is 0. But if the first program output a longer string? But it doesn't. So we are safe.\n\n        We assume the first program outputs one char, so the second program's input is one char -> the counting algorithm will run in O(n) with n=1.\n\n        We are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n          program main\n            implicit none\n\n            character(len=1000) :: s1  ! allow long string\n            integer(kind=8) :: k\n            character(len=1) :: output1\n            integer :: n, i, j, code\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: str2, new_str\n            integer :: tmp_cnt, len_new, pos\n            integer :: output2\n            character(len=100) :: output2_str  ! to hold the string representation of output2\n            integer :: freq(0:255)   ! frequency array for ASCII\n            integer :: oddCount, length\n\n            !

Check if k is within bounds\n            if (k > n) then\n                ! We'll crash by accessing s1 beyond its length\n                print *, 'Array index out of bounds'\n                stop\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 1: Process the first k characters of s1\n            output1 = '1'   ! default\n            do i = 1, k\n                if (s1(i:i) == '1') then\n                    if (i == k) then\n                        output1 = '1'\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                else\n                    output1 = s1(i:i)\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 2: \n            !   Set str2 to be the string of output1 (which is one character)\n            str2 = output1   ! This creates a string of length 1\n\n            ! Now, replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in str2 to form new_str\n            new_str = ''\n            i = 1\n            do while (i <= len(str2))\n                if (i <= len(str2)-1) then\n                    if (str2(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n                        new_str = new_str // 'D'\n                        i = i + 2\n                    else\n                        new_str = new_str // str2(i:i)\n                        i = i + 1\n                    end if\n                else\n                    new_str = new_str // str2(i:i)\n                    i = i + 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Now, run the counting algorithm on new_str\n            output2 = 0\n            tmp_cnt = 0\n            length = len(new_str)\n            do i = 1, length\n                if (new_str(i:i) == 'A') then\n                    tmp_cnt = tmp_cnt + 1\n                else if (new_str(i:i) == 'D') then\n                    output2 = output2 + tmp_cnt\n                else\n                    tmp_cnt = 0\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Convert output2 to a string\n            write(output2_str, '(I0)') output2\n            ! Now, we have the string in output2_str, but it might have leading spaces? The format I0 gives no leading spaces.\n\n            ! Step 3: process the string output2_str\n            freq = 0\n            n = len_trim(output2_str)\n            do i = 1, n\n                j = iachar(output2_str(i:i))   ! returns the ASCII code\n                freq(j) = freq(j) + 1\n            end do\n\n            oddCount = 0\n            do i = 0, 255\n                if (freq(i) > 0) then\n                    if (mod(freq(i),2) /= 0) then\n                        oddCount = oddCount + 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /= 0) then\n                write(*,*) 'First'\n            else\n                write(*,*) 'Second'\n            end if\n\n          end program main\n\n        However, we must test with the example that the second program might get a string of more than one character? \n\n        But the first program only outputs one character. So the second program will always get a string of one character. Therefore, the replacement of \"BC\" will never happen. And the counting will always yield 0. And the third program will always get \"0\". \n\n        Therefore, we can simplify by noting that the second step will always yield 0? \n\n        But to be faithful, we write the code as above.\n\n        Let's run with the example \"1324 3\" -> output1='3', then new_str='3', then output2=0, then output2_str=\"0\", then oddCount=1 -> \"First\".\n\n        And \"111 2\" -> output1='1', then new_str='1', then output2=0, then \"0\", then \"First\".\n\n        It works.\n\n        However, note: the replacement of \"BC\" might be needed if the first program outputs a string that contains \"BC\"? But the first program outputs either a single non-'1' character or '1'. So it cannot output 'B' followed by 'C'? Because it outputs only one character. \n\n        Therefore, the replacement is unnecessary. But we do it for correctness.\n\n        We'll run the program.\n\n        But note: the string `new_str` might be built by concatenation. We start with an empty string. Then we add one character. So `new_str` becomes the same as `str2`.\n\n        So we could skip the replacement and just use `str2`? \n\n        But we do the replacement for generality.\n\n        We are done."
