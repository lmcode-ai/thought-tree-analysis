    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC172_D) reads an integer n from input, calculates some formula involving loops and math, and outputs the result. The second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string input, takes the first character, adds 1 to it (probably ASCII?), and prints that character. The third file (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, counts character frequencies, checks if the number of characters with odd counts is <=1 or odd, then outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the user said the programs are executed in sequence, with each output as next's input. So the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. The final output is from the third.\n\nWait, but looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is a number (ans). The second program expects a string input (since it reads a line and takes the first character). So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. Hmm, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then converted to a string (like \"123\"), and that's the input for the second program. The second program takes that string, takes the first character (like '1'), adds 1 (so '2'), and outputs that. Then the third program takes that single character (like \"2\") as input, and processes it.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is expecting a string input, which is read via bufferedReader.readLine(). So the second program's output is a single character (like '2'), which is then the input to the third program. The third program then processes that string (the single character) to see if the counts of characters (only one character here) have odd counts. Since the input is a single character, the count is 1, which is odd. So the third program would check if oddCount is 1, which would trigger \"First\".\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me go step by step.\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\n1. First program (File1) reads an integer n from input. It computes ans and prints it. So the output is a number, say 123.\n\n2. Second program (File2) takes that number as input (as a string, like \"123\"), reads the first character (the '1'), adds 1 to its ASCII value (so '1' is 49, adding 1 gives 50 which is '2'), and outputs that character. So the output is '2'.\n\n3. Third program (File3) takes that '2' as input (as a string \"2\"), processes it. The string is \"2\", so the map has '2' with count 1. The oddCount is 1, so since 1 <=1, it outputs \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\".\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program that does the same steps without I/O in the middle.\n\nThe Fortran program must read the initial input (the n for the first program), process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result (the third program's output).\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n from user).\n\n2. Compute the first program's calculation (the ans variable).\n\n3. Take that ans, convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, get the new character (this is the second program's processing).\n\n4. Take that character (as a string), process it through the third program's logic (count characters, check odd counts, decide \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nFinally, output the result of step 4.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is a bit more precise. Let me check the second Java program again.\n\nSecond Java program (File2):\n\nIt reads a line (s = r.readLine()), then outputs the first character of s plus 1. So if the input is \"123\", then s is \"123\", s.charAt(0) is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so output is '2'.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first step (computing ans), we need to convert ans to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, then that becomes the input for the third step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are handled as ASCII codes. So for example, converting the number to a string, then taking the first character's ASCII value, adding 1, then converting back to a character.\n\nThen, the third step's input is that single character (as a string). The third program counts the characters in that string. Since it's a single character, the count is 1, so oddCount is 1. So the output is \"First\".\n\nWait, but let me confirm the third program's logic again. The third program's code:\n\nIt reads a string, counts each character's frequency. Then counts how many have odd counts. If oddCount is <=1 or oddCount is odd (wait, the condition is \"if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0)\", which is redundant because if oddCount is <=1, then it's either 0 or 1. So the condition is true if oddCount is 0,1, or any odd number. Wait, but the code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, let's parse the condition:\n\nThe condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So:\n\n- If oddCount is 0: yes, so first.\n\n- 1: yes.\n\n- 2: no (since 2>1 and even).\n\n- 3: yes (odd).\n\n- 4: no (even and >1).\n\nSo the condition is true when oddCount is 0,1,3,5 etc. So the output is \"First\" in those cases, else \"Second\".\n\nIn our case, the third program's input is a single character (from the second step's output). So the count is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1, so condition is true, so output is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is \"First\".\n\nBut the problem is to translate all three steps into a single Fortran program. Let's structure this.\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nRead the initial input (n as integer).\n\nCompute the first program's ans: the loop from 1 to n, adding i * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2. Wait, the formula in Java is ans += (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1)/2. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n, compute term = i * (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) / 2, then sum all terms.\n\nWait, but in Java, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, using integer division (//).\n\nSo the first part is straightforward.\n\nThen, the second step: take the ans (which is a long in Java, so in Fortran, probably an integer*8 or integer(8)), convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, then that becomes the input for the third step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done with write(*,*) or using internal writes. For example, to convert ans to a string, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans\nwrite(str_ans, '(i0)') ans\n\nThen, the first character is str_ans(1:1). But need to check if the string is properly null-terminated or not. But in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so leading spaces might be present if the number is shorter than the allocated length. Wait, but when writing with '(i0)', it should write the number without leading spaces. Hmm, perhaps better to use an internal write.\n\nAlternatively, to get the first character of the string representation of ans.\n\nOnce we have that first character, we can get its ASCII code, add 1, then convert back to a character. For example:\n\nchar = str_ans(1:1)\nnew_char = char(ichar(char) + 1)\n\nWait, in Fortran, ichar returns the ASCII code, and char converts back. So that's manageable.\n\nThen, the third step's input is the new_char as a string. So the third step's processing is to count the characters in that string (which is just the new_char). The count is 1, so oddCount is 1. So the condition is met, so output \"First\".\n\nWait, but let me think again. The third program's code is:\n\nRead the input string (from the second program's output, which is a single character). Then, for each character in the string, count their frequencies. Then, count how many have odd counts. Since the input is a single character, the frequency is 1, so oddCount is 1. So the condition (oddCount <=1 || oddCount%2 !=0) is true, so output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is \"First\".\n\nBut in the Fortran program, we need to process all steps without I/O in between. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Compute ans as per first program.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, get new_char.\n\n4. Process new_char as the input string for the third step's logic.\n\n5. Output the result of step 4.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute ans.\n\nProcess step 2 (convert ans to string, get first character, add 1).\n\nProcess step 3 (count characters in the new_char string, decide output).\n\nNow, let's code each part.\n\nFirst, the first part (computing ans):\n\ninteger :: n, i, ans\nans = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    term = i * (n / i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n    ans = ans + term\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to ensure that variables are integers. Since n can be up to, say, 1e9 (if the original problem allows that), but in Java it's a long. So in Fortran, we need to use 64-bit integers. So variables should be integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18).\n\nAlternatively, use integer*8.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger*8 :: n, ans, i, term\n\nWait, but the input n is read as integer, but in Java it's read as int (so up to 2^31-1). But in Fortran, if using integer*8, that's okay.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code uses int for n, but the ans is a long. So in Fortran, n can be integer*4, but ans must be integer*8.\n\nSo code:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nans = 0_8\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    term = i * (n / i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n\n    ans = ans + term\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division n/i is integer division. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the loop, i can be up to n, so when i =n, term is n * (1) * (2)/2 = n*1*2/2 = n. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the second step: converting ans to a string.\n\nWe can use an internal write statement.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans\n\nwrite(str_ans, '(i0)') ans\n\nThen, the first character is str_ans(1:1). But need to make sure that leading spaces are not present. The '(i0)' format should write the number without leading spaces, so the first character is the first digit.\n\nThen, get the first character:\n\nchar = str_ans(1:1)\n\nBut in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_char\n\nfirst_char = str_ans(1:1)\n\nThen, compute new_char:\n\ninteger :: ascii_code\n\nascii_code = ichar(first_char) + 1\n\nnew_char = char(ascii_code)\n\nNow, the third step's input is the new_char as a string. So the input string is new_char.\n\nNow, processing the third step's logic.\n\nThe third step's code counts the frequency of each character in the input string. Since the input is a single character, the frequency is 1 for that character, and others 0. So the oddCount is 1.\n\nBut to code this in Fortran:\n\nWe can process the input string (which is new_char) as follows:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: input_str = new_char\n\ninteger :: oddCount = 0\n\n! Initialize a frequency array. Since characters can be any ASCII, but in this case, it's just one character.\n\n! Alternatively, since the input is a single character, the frequency is 1 for that character.\n\n! So, the oddCount is 1.\n\nBut to code it properly, perhaps:\n\nWe can count the frequency of each character in the input_str.\n\nBut since the input_str is length 1, it's easy.\n\nThe input_str is a single character, so the frequency is 1. So oddCount is 1.\n\nThus, the condition is met, so output \"First\".\n\nBut to code it properly, perhaps:\n\nWe can do:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: input_str = new_char\n\ninteger :: count = 1  ! since it's one character.\n\nif (count % 2 == 1) then\n\n    oddCount = 1\n\nelse\n\n    oddCount = 0\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, they loop through all entries in the map. Since the input is a single character, the map has one entry with count 1. So oddCount is 1.\n\nThus, the condition (oddCount <=1 or oddCount is odd) is true, so output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, in code:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n\n    print *, \"First\"\n\nelse\n\n    print *, \"Second\"\n\nend if\n\nBut since oddCount is 1, it will print \"First\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n\n    integer(8) :: ans, i, term\n    character(len=20) :: str_ans\n    character(len=1) :: first_char, new_char\n    integer :: oddCount, count\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    ! Compute ans (first program)\n    ans = 0_8\n    do i = 1, n\n        term = i * (n / i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n        ans = ans + term\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert ans to string and process second step\n    write(str_ans, '(i0)') ans\n    first_char = str_ans(1:1)\n    new_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\n    ! Process third step\n    ! The input string is new_char (length 1)\n    count = 1  ! since it's one character\n    if (count ==1) then\n        oddCount = 1\n    else\n        oddCount =0\n    end if\n\n    ! Determine output\n    if (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n        print *, \"First\"\n    else\n        print *, \"Second\"\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third step's processing, perhaps I should code it more accurately, even though in this case it's redundant. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the input_str is new_char, which is length 1. So the count is 1. So oddCount is 1.\n\nAlternatively, to code it properly, even if the input was longer, but in this case, it's just one character.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ninput_str = new_char\n\ncount = 1\n\nBut perhaps better to code it as:\n\ninput_str = new_char\n\ncount = 1\n\nBut in a general case, if the input_str had more characters, but here it's just one.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ninput_str = new_char\n\n! Initialize count for the character\ncount = 1\n\n! So oddCount is 1.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, they loop over all characters in the input string, count their frequencies, then count how many have odd counts.\n\nIn our case, the input is a single character, so the frequency is 1, so oddCount is 1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should work as intended.\n\nWait, but let me check possible edge cases.\n\nSuppose the first program's ans is 0. Then converting to string would be \"0\", first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1', so input_str is '1', count is 1, so output \"First\".\n\nAnother case: if ans is 9, then the string is \"9\", first character is '9', adding 1 gives ':', which is ASCII 58. The input_str is \":\", count 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: if ans is 123, then the string is \"123\", first character '1' \u2192 '2', so input_str is \"2\", count 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: if ans is 0, then same as first case.\n\nWhat if the ans is a negative number? But in the first Java program, n is read as an int, which is non-negative (since it's a problem input, probably n is positive). So assuming n is positive, ans is positive.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let me check the code again for possible errors.\n\nIn the first loop, the term calculation:\n\nterm = i * (n / i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nWait, in Fortran, the order of operations is important. Let me see:\n\nThe formula in Java is (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1)/2.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nLet q = n / i (integer division).\n\nThen term = i * q * (q +1)/2.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, the calculation is correct as written.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division is integer division, so n/i is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: when i is 0, but the loop starts at 1, so no problem.\n\nNow, the write statement for str_ans: using '(i0)' which writes the integer without leading spaces. So the first character is correct.\n\nThen, first_char is str_ans(1:1). But what if the string is longer than 20 characters? Well, the str_ans is length 20, which should be sufficient for most numbers. But if ans is extremely large (like 1e18), then 20 characters may not be enough. However, in the original Java code, the first program uses a long, which is 64 bits, so the maximum value is 2^63-1, which is about 9e18, which is 19 digits. So 20 characters is enough.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should be as written above.\n\nWait, but in the code, the variable 'count' is set to 1, but perhaps better to code it as:\n\ninput_str = new_char\n\ncount = 1\n\nBut in the code above, I have:\n\ncount =1\n\nBut in the code, the variable 'count' is declared, but perhaps better to compute it as the length of the input_str? Wait, no, the count is the frequency of the character. Since the input_str is a single character, the frequency is 1. So the code is okay.\n\nAlternatively, to make it more accurate, even if the input_str was longer (but in our case it's not), but since the input_str is new_char (length 1), it's okay.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as written."
