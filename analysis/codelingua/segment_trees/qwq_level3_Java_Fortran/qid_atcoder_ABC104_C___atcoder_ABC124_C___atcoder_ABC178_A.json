So for D=10, the total could be up to 1e6 * 10 (for all bits set), which is 1e7, which fits in 32-bit integer (max 2e9). But if p[i] is larger, like 1e5, then 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, but multiplied by D=10, that's 1e8, which is still okay. But perhaps better to use integer(8) for safety.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (ABC104_C) reads input D and G, then arrays p and c. It does some bit manipulation to find the minimum number of problems needed to reach at least G points. The output is the minimum value.\n\nThe second file (ABC124_C) takes a string and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make it alternate between '0' and '1' either starting from the left or the right. It reads a string and outputs the minimum between two counts.\n\nThe third file (ABC178_A) simply takes an integer x, and outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence without I/O in the middle.\n\nWait, but how exactly are the outputs connected? Let me see:\n\nThe first program's output is a number (min), which is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a string input, but the first outputs an integer. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is \"min\", which is an integer. The second program's input is a string (x). The third program's input is an integer x. So the first's output is an integer, which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the sequence is different?\n\nWait, perhaps the three Java programs are meant to be run in sequence, each taking input from the previous output. But the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the first line of its input is a string). So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, the first program's output is an integer (min). So maybe the sequence is not as I thought. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three Java programs are separate, and the user wants to chain them, but the outputs don't match. Hmm, perhaps the user intended that each program's output is the input to the next, but the actual code may not form a valid chain. But since the user says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior, I have to assume that the outputs are compatible. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input to the second program, which expects a string. That would require converting the number to a string. But the second program's code reads a string (x = in.next();). So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then converted to a string and passed as input to the second program. Then the second program's output is a number (the min of a1 and a2), which is then passed to the third program, which expects an integer. So the third program would take that number and output 0 or 1 accordingly.\n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nJava1's output (integer) \u2192 becomes input to Java2 (as a string). Java2 processes it, outputs an integer (the min count). That integer is then input to Java3, which outputs 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (D, G, p and c arrays).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (min).\n\n3. Use that min as the input to the second program (as a string). So the second program's input is the string representation of min.\n\n4. The second program processes that string, outputs a number (the min between a1 and a2).\n\n5. That number is then the input to the third program, which outputs 0 or 1.\n\n6. The final Fortran program must output the result of the third step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (D, G, p and c arrays).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (min).\n\n- Then, take that min as the input to the second step (so the second step's input is the string representation of min).\n\n- Compute the second step's result (the min count).\n\n- Then, take that result as the input to the third step (as an integer), compute the third step's result (0 or 1).\n\n- Finally, output that result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must handle all three steps in sequence, with no I/O except first read and last write.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program (ABC104_C):\n\nThe first program's main steps:\n\nRead D and G, then D pairs of p[i] and c[i].\n\nThen, iterate over all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^D -1). For each bitmask, compute the total score and the number of problems solved. If the score is less than G, try adding the maximum possible from the remaining problems (but in a specific way). Then track the minimum number of problems needed.\n\nThe key is to translate this into Fortran loops and variables.\n\nSecond program (ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string (the output of first program's min, which is an integer, so the string is the digits of that integer). The program processes this string to find the minimal changes needed to make it alternate starting from left or right.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output (min) is an integer, which is converted to a string and passed as input to the second program. So in the Fortran code, after computing min, we need to convert it to a string, then process it as the input for the second step.\n\nThird program (ABC178_A):\n\nTakes an integer x (the output of the second program's result), and outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (ABC104_C):\n\nVariables:\n\nD is an integer, G is a long (in Fortran, integer*8 or integer(8)), but in Java it's a long, so in Fortran, perhaps use integer(8).\n\np and c are arrays of integers, size D.\n\nThe loop over all bits from 0 to 2^D -1. For each bit, check each bit's set bits, compute the score and solve_num.\n\nThen, if the score is less than G, loop from the end to find which problem to add partial points.\n\nWait, the code in Java for the first part:\n\nIn the inner loop (when score < G), it loops from D-1 down to 0, and for each i not set in the bitmask, adds as many as possible (p[i]-1) problems (since the first p[i] problems give 100*(i+1)*p[i], but if you don't take all, you can take up to p[i]-1? Or maybe the code is trying to add the maximum possible from the remaining problem set to reach G.\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program's loop:\n\nif (score < G) then:\n\nloop over i from D-1 down to 0:\n\nif the bit is not set (so the problem set i is not fully taken), then for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (since p[i]-1 iterations?), adding 100*(i+1) each time, and increment solve_num. Break when score >= G.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < p[i] - 1; j++) {\n\nso j runs from 0 to p[i]-2, so total of p[i]-1 times. Each time adds 100*(i+1) to the score, and increments solve_num.\n\nWait, but why p[i]-1? Because the problem set i has p[i] questions. If you didn't take all of them in the initial bitmask (since the bit is not set), then you can take some of them to reach the goal. But you can take up to p[i]-1? Because if you take all p[i], then you would have included it in the bitmask. So the code is trying to add as many as possible from the unselected problem sets, but not all of them (since that would require setting the bit). So the maximum you can add is p[i]-1 problems from that set, each worth 100*(i+1) points. So the loop adds each of those, and breaks early if the score reaches G.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. So in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, the first part's variables:\n\nIn Fortran, D is an integer, G is integer(8). p and c are arrays of integers, size D.\n\nThe loop over all bits (bit from 0 to 2^D -1). For each bit, we need to loop through each of the D bits to see if set.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling bits can be done via bit operations. However, for D up to, say, 10 (since 2^10 is manageable), but the problem's constraints (since in the first Java code, the static final INF is 10000, but D could be up to, say, 10? The problem ABC104_C is probably from a programming contest, so D is likely small enough for brute-force.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop over bit can be done with a do loop from 0 to 2**D -1.\n\nBut in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. So 2**D.\n\nBut for D up to say 15, 2^15 is 32768, manageable. But if D is larger, but in the problem's context, probably okay.\n\nNow, the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead D, G, then p and c arrays.\n\nInitialize min to a large value (like 100000).\n\nThen loop over all bits from 0 to 2**D -1:\n\nscore = 0\n\nsolve_num =0\n\ndo i = 1 to D (since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so need to adjust indices)\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i < D; i++), so in Fortran, perhaps the arrays are 1-based, so p(1) to p(D).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the problem numbers are 1-based? Because the score is 100*(i+1)*p[i]. So for i from 0 to D-1, the problem set is (i+1)th problem.\n\nIn Fortran, if we have p(1) to p(D), then the problem number is i (since i runs from 1 to D). So the code can be adjusted.\n\nSo for each bit, for each i from 1 to D:\n\nif the bit has the (i-1)th bit set (since in Java, the loop was 0-based), then:\n\nscore += 100 * i * p(i) + c(i-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to D-1. The problem number is (i+1). So in Fortran, if we have i from 1 to D, then the problem number is i. So the code would be:\n\nif (bit has the (i-1)th bit set?) Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of bits.\n\nWait, in Java, the bitmask is for each of the D elements. For each i in 0..D-1, the bit is checked as (bit & (1 << i)) !=0.\n\nIn Fortran, for a given bit value (integer), to check if the ith bit (0-based) is set, we can do btest(bit, i).\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 0 to D-1 (since in Java it's 0-based), but in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so perhaps the loop is over i from 1 to D, and adjust the bitmask accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use 1-based indices in Fortran, so the problem numbers are 1-based, and the bitmask is for each of the D elements (1-based in Fortran, but the bits are 0-based in the bitmask).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, the variables:\n\ninteger :: D, p(D), c(D)\n\ninteger(8) :: G\n\ninteger :: bit, i, score, solve_num, min_val\n\nmin_val = 100000\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\n   score = 0\n\n   solve_num =0\n\n   do i = 1, D\n\n      if (btest(bit, i-1)) then  ! because in Java, the loop was 0-based for i, so the ith element in Java is (i-1) in Fortran's 1-based array?\n\n      Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, for the loop over D elements (0-based), the bitmask is for each of the D elements. So for the first element (i=0 in Java), the bit is checked as (bit & (1 << 0)), which is the 0th bit.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then for the first element (i=1 in Fortran), the corresponding bit is the 0th bit (since in Java it's i=0). So in Fortran, the loop over i from 1 to D, and check the (i-1)th bit of the bitmask.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in the inner loop:\n\nif (btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\n   score = score + 100 * i * p(i) + c(i)\n\n   solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\nend if\n\nWait, in Java, the c array is stored as c[i], so in Fortran, c(i) is correct.\n\nThen, after the first loop over all i, if the score is less than G, then we need to do the second loop.\n\nThe second loop in Java is:\n\nloop:\n\n   for (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--)\n\n      if (bit's ith bit is not set (i.e., not included in the bitmask))\n\n         then for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (so p[i]-1 times):\n\n             add 100*(i+1) to score, increment solve_num.\n\n             if score >= G, break loop.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1  ! since in Java it's D-1 downto 0, so in Fortran 1-based, it's D downto 1.\n\n   if ( .not. btest(bit, i-1) ) then\n\n      do j = 1 to p(i) -1  ! since in Java it's p[i]-1 iterations (j from 0 to p[i]-2)\n\n         score = score + 100 * i\n\n         solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n         if (score >= G) then\n\n             exit loop  ! but how to break out of the loops?\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      ! but after the inner loop, if we didn't break, then we continue.\n\n   end if\n\n   if (score >= G) then\n\n      exit  ! exit the i loop?\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, the Java code uses a labeled loop 'loop' and breaks out of it when the score reaches G. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use a flag or a goto.\n\nAlternatively, after each addition, check if score >= G and break out of the loops.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of the structure.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (i from D-1 downto 0) {\n\n   if (bit not set for i) {\n\n      for (j from 0 to p[i]-2) {\n\n         add 100*(i+1) to score, etc.\n\n         if (score >= G) break loop;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   if (score >= G) break;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1\n\n   if ( .not. btest(bit, i-1) ) then\n\n      do j = 1, p(i)-1  ! since p[i] in Java is p(i) in Fortran, so p(i)-1 iterations.\n\n         score = score + 100*i\n\n         solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n         if (score >= G) then\n\n             exit  ! exit the j loop\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (score >= G) then\n\n          exit  ! exit the i loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the inner loop (j) can break early, and then the outer loop (i) can also break. So this should replicate the Java's behavior.\n\nOnce this is done, then check if score >= G, and if so, update min_val.\n\nSo after all that, the first part's code can be written in Fortran.\n\nNow, the second part (ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string (the output of the first program's min). So in the Fortran code, after computing min_val, we need to convert it to a string, then process it as per the second program.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is a string x. Then two approaches are taken:\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nStart from the second character, and if it's same as previous, change it to the opposite, count the changes (a1).\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nStart from the second to last character backwards, and if same as previous, change the previous to opposite, count a2.\n\nThen output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nIn Fortran, the string can be handled as a character array.\n\nSo steps:\n\nTake the min_val (integer) from first part, convert to a string (e.g., using write and read), then process it.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, you can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') min_val\n\ntrim(s) to remove leading spaces? Or perhaps use adjustl.\n\nThen, process the string s.\n\nThe processing for a1:\n\nInitialize a as the string s.\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i = 2 to len_trim(s)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (a(i) == '1') then\n\n          a(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          a(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first approach loops from i=1 to x.length()-1 (since in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i < x.length(); i++)), so in Fortran, starting from the second character (i=2 in 1-based).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (i=1; i < x.length(); i++), so in 0-based terms, starting at index 1 (second character). So in Fortran, the loop is from 2 to len_trim(s).\n\nSimilarly for the second approach (b):\n\nProcess the string from the end backwards.\n\nInitialize b as the original string.\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s) -1 downto 1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i+1:i+1)) then\n\n      if (b(i) == '1') then\n\n          b(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          b(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Java's second loop, it's for (i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--), so in 0-based terms, starting at the last index (x.length()-1) down to 1 (so in 1-based, it's from len down to 2).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--), so in 0-based indices, i starts at the last character (index x.length()-1) and goes down to 1 (so the second character). So in Fortran, the loop would be from len_trim(s) downto 2 (since in 1-based, the last character is len_trim(s), and we go down to 2).\n\nWait, in the Java code, for the second approach (b):\n\nfor (int i = x.length()-1; i >0; i--):\n\n   if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n      change the i-1 character.\n\n   }\n\nWait, the Java code in the second loop is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--) {\n\n   if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n      if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to 0 else 1.\n\n      a2++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran terms, for each i from len_trim(s) down to 2 (since i starts at the last character's index (len_trim(s)), and i>0 in Java is equivalent to i >=1 in 1-based, but the loop is i from len down to 2 (since in Java, i starts at x.length()-1 (which is len_trim(s) in 1-based minus 1?), no, perhaps better to think in terms of 1-based.\n\nWait, in Java, the string's length is L. The loop runs i from L-1 (0-based) down to 1 (0-based). So in 1-based terms, that's from L down to 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n          b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo after processing both a and b, the minimum of a1 and a2 is the result of the second step.\n\nNow, the third part (ABC178_A):\n\nThe input is the result of the second step (the min between a1 and a2). Let's call this x.\n\nThe third program outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, after getting the second result (let's call it second_result), the third step is simply:\n\nthird_result = 0 if second_result ==1 else 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read D, G, then D pairs of p and c.\n\n2. Compute the first part's min_val.\n\n3. Convert min_val to a string s.\n\n4. Process s to get the second_result (min(a1, a2)).\n\n5. Compute third_result based on second_result.\n\n6. Output third_result.\n\nNow, handling the data types and variables.\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: D, p(1:D), c(1:D)\n\ninteger(8) :: G\n\ninteger :: min_val = 100000\n\nThen, after computing min_val, we need to convert it to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') min_val\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! to remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process s as per the second part.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: a, b\n\ninteger :: a1, a2, second_result\n\na = s\n\nb = s\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n          a(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          a(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n          b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nsecond_result = min(a1, a2)\n\nThen, third step:\n\ninteger :: third_result\n\nthird_result = 0\n\nif (second_result /=1) then\n\n   third_result =1\n\nend if\n\nFinally, print third_result.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut need to handle the first part's loops correctly.\n\nNow, the first part's loops:\n\nThe outer loop over all bits from 0 to 2**D -1.\n\nBut in Fortran, 2**D can be a large number. For D up to 20, 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable. But if D is larger, but in programming contest problems, D is likely small.\n\nSo the code for the first part:\n\nmin_val = 100000\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\n   score =0\n\n   solve_num =0\n\n   do i =1, D\n\n      if (btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\n         score = score + 100*i*p(i) + c(i)\n\n         solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (score < G) then\n\n      ! need to add partial from some problem not in the bitmask\n\n      do i = D, 1, -1\n\n         if (.not. btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\n            do j =1, p(i)-1\n\n               score = score + 100*i\n\n               solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n               if (score >= G) then\n\n                  exit\n\n               end if\n\n            end do\n\n            if (score >= G) then\n\n               exit\n\n            end if\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   if (score >= G) then\n\n      if (solve_num < min_val) then\n\n         min_val = solve_num\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after adding the partial points, it breaks out of the inner loops. The way I wrote the Fortran code may not exactly replicate that, but perhaps it's okay.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after adding each j, if the score reaches G, it breaks the labeled loop 'loop', which is the outer i loop. So in Fortran, after the inner j loop, if score >= G, then we can exit the i loop (the D to 1 loop).\n\nIn the current code, after the j loop, if score >= G, then exit the j loop, then check if score >= G and exit the i loop.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: D, i, j, bit, score, solve_num, min_val, second_result, third_result\n  integer(8) :: G\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n  character(len=20) :: s, a, b\n  integer :: a1, a2, len_s\n\n  !

If so, change the (i-1)th character.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, checking possible issues:\n\n- The first part's loop over bits: 2**D may be a large number, but in Fortran, integers can handle up to 2^31 or so, so for D up to 20, it's okay.\n\n- The variables for the first part's score and solve_num: in Java, score is a long (64-bit), but in Fortran, the default integer is 4 bytes (32-bit). However, in the problem's constraints, perhaps the maximum possible score is manageable in 32 bits. Alternatively, use integer(8) for score and solve_num. Wait, in the first part's code, the variables score and solve_num are declared as integers. But in Java, the first program's score is a long (since G is a long). So in Fortran, perhaps we need to use integer(8) for score and solve_num to avoid overflow.\n\nAh, that's a problem. Because in the first Java code, the score is computed as 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i], which could be large. For example, if D is 10, and p[i] is 1000, then 100*10*1000 = 1e5, plus c[i] up to 1e5 (assuming c[i] is up to 1e5 as per the problem's constraints). So for D=10, the total could be up to 1e6 * 10 (for all bits set), which is 1e7, which fits in 32-bit integer (max 2e9). But if p[i] is larger, like 1e5, then 100*10*1e5 = 1e7, but multiplied by D=10, that's 1e8, which is still okay. But perhaps better to use integer(8) for safety.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, variables score and solve_num should be integer(8).\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nscore is declared as integer, but in Java it's a long. So in Fortran, to match, we need to use integer(8).\n\nSimilarly, solve_num is the number of problems, which can be up to sum(p[i]), which for D=10 and p[i]=1e5 each, sum is 1e6, which is within 32-bit integer (max 2e9). So maybe solve_num can stay as integer, but to be safe, perhaps use integer(8).\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ninteger(8) :: score, solve_num\n\nAlso, in the loop over bits, the variable bit is an integer. For D up to 30, 2^30 is about a billion, which is within 32-bit integer (max 2^31-1 ~ 2e9). So for D up to 30, it's okay. But if D is larger, but in programming contest problems, probably okay.\n\nNow, adjusting the code:\n\nIn the first part's declarations:\n\ninteger :: D, i, j, bit, min_val, second_result, third_result\ninteger(8) :: G, score, solve_num\n\nAlso, the min_val is initialized to 100000, which is an integer.\n\nNow, the code should handle large values.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, when converting min_val to a string, using '(i0)' should work, but need to ensure that the string is properly handled. The adjustl(s) removes leading spaces, so len_trim(s) gives the correct length.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs min_val = 5. Then s is '5', so len_s is 1. Then in the second part's loops:\n\nFor a1: the loop from 2 to 1 (since len_s=1), so no iterations. a1 remains 0.\n\nFor a2: loop from 1 downto 2, which doesn't run. So a2 is 0. So second_result is 0. Then third_result is 1 (since 0 !=1).\n\nWait, but if min_val is 1, then second_result would be 0 (if the string is '1', then a1 and a2 are 0?), so third_result would be 0.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst program's output is 1 \u2192 s is '1'.\n\nProcessing second part:\n\na is '1', length 1. The loop for a1 runs from 2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. a1=0.\n\nFor a2: loop from 1 downto 2 \u2192 no iterations. a2=0. So second_result is 0. Then third_result is 1 (since 0 !=1 \u2192 third_result =1? Wait no:\n\nWait third_result is 0 if second_result is 1, else 1.\n\nWait the third program's code is:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0 where bool is (x ==1).\n\nSo if x is 1 \u2192 result is 0.\n\nIf x is 0 \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo in the example where second_result is 0, third_result is 1.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: second_result is 1 \u2192 third_result is 0.\n\nSo the code for the third part is correct.\n\nNow, putting all corrections into the code.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: D, i, j, bit, min_val, second_result, third_result\n  integer(8) :: G, score, solve_num\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n  character(len=20) :: s, a, b\n  integer :: a1, a2, len_s\n\n  !
