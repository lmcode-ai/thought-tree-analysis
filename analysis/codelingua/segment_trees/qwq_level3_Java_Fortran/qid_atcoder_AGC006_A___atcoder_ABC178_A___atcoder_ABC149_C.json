So the input must have two strings each of length n. So the first program's input is: n, then s1, then str, each as separate tokens. So in Fortran, the first part must read n, then read two strings (each of length n). Then process the first step, then pass the result to the second step, etc. Now, the first step's output is 2*n - len, where len is the minimum of f[cnt], n, n. Wait, the code says:\n\nint len = Math.min(f[cnt], Math.min(n, n));\n\nWhich is redundant, since Math.min(n,n) is n. So len is min(f[cnt], n). So the output is 2n - len. So the first program's output is an integer A = 2n - len. Then the second program takes A as input, and outputs 0 if A is 1, else 1. Then the third program takes that output (0 or 1) as input, and outputs the next prime after that (with possible bugs as discussed).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (AGC006_A). It reads two strings s1 and str, each of length n. Then it constructs a combined array b by concatenating str followed by s1. It computes the failure function (like in KMP algorithm) for this combined string. The result is 2n minus the minimum of the last failure value and n. The output is this value.\n\nThe second file (ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1. If so, outputs 0; else 1. Wait, actually, the code is a bit convoluted. Let me see: bool is true when x is 1. Then result is !bool, so if x is 1, result is 0, else 1. So the output is 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nThird file (ABC149_C) takes an integer x. If x is 2, it's prime, but the code checks if x is even and not 2, then increments to next odd. Then it loops, checking if x is prime. The loop increments x by 2 each time until it finds a prime. The output is the first prime >= x (if x was even and not 2, starts at x+1 if x was even, else x or x+2 etc).\n\nNow, the sequence is: the output of the first program is input to the second, whose output is input to the third. The final output is the third's result.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? The first program's output is a number (2n - len). That number is the input to the second program, which takes an integer x. The second's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. The third program takes that 0 or 1 as x, and outputs the next prime after that (but since 0 and 1 are even, except 2, so for x=0, the code would start at 1, but since 1 is not prime, it would check 3, etc. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the third program's input is x. Let's see:\n\nIf the second program outputs 0, then the third program's input is 0. The third program's code:\n\nif x !=2 and x even, then x becomes x+1 (since x is 0, which is even and not 2, so x becomes 1). Then the loop starts checking from 3 up to sqrt(1). Wait, sqrt(1) is 1, so the loop for i from 3 to 1 (which doesn't run). Then since i (3) is not <= sqrt(1), the condition i>sqrtNum is true, so breaks. So x is 1, but 1 is not a prime. Wait, but the code's logic might have a problem here. Wait, the code in ABC149_C:\n\nWait, the code starts with x = input. Then if x is not 2 and even, x is set to x+1 (so becomes odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop is while true, so it checks:\n\nCompute sqrt(x). Then loop i from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2. If any i divides x, break. If after all i, the loop breaks without breaking, then x is prime, so output it. Else, x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, let's see for x=0:\n\nOriginal x is 0. Since x !=2 and even, so x becomes 1. Then the loop starts. The sqrt(1) is 1. The for loop starts at i=3, which is already larger than sqrt(x)=1. So the loop doesn't run. Then the condition is if i>sqrtNum (i is 3, which is >1). So the loop breaks, and x is 1, which is considered prime? But 1 is not a prime. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, the code might have a bug here. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's requirements. Let's proceed as per the code.\n\nWait, the code's logic for checking primes:\n\nThe code checks for divisors from 3 up to sqrt(x), stepping by 2. If any divisor is found, it breaks and increments x. If none found, then x is prime. But for x=1, sqrt(x)=1, so the loop from 3 to 1 doesn't run. So the code would think 1 is a prime? That's incorrect. But perhaps the problem expects the code to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the code is intended to handle x starting from some value where x is at least 2. But in the problem's context, perhaps the third program's input is 0 or 1, so let's see:\n\nIf the second program outputs 0, then the third program's input is 0. The code would set x to 1 (since 0 is even and not 2). Then the loop checks if 1 is prime. The code would think it is, but that's wrong. However, the problem's code may have that bug. Since the user provided the code as is, I have to replicate it exactly.\n\nSo, the third program's output for input 0 would be 1, but that's not a prime. Hmm, but maybe the code is intended to find the next prime after x. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nwhile true:\n\n   compute sqrt(x)\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2:\n\n      if x mod i ==0 \u2192 break\n\n   if i>sqrt(x) \u2192 break (so x is prime)\n\n   else \u2192 x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the loop continues until x is a prime. So for x=1, the loop would exit, thinking it's prime. So the code would output 1, which is incorrect. But perhaps the problem expects that. Since the code is given, I have to translate it as is.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is an integer (let's call it A). Then second program takes A as input, outputs 0 if A is 1, else 1. Then third program takes that 0 or 1 as input, and outputs the next prime after that (but with possible bugs as above).\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, without I/O in between. So the first part reads the input (for the first Java program), then processes through all three steps, and the last part outputs the final result.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program: n, s1, str. (Wait, in the first Java program, the input is n, then two strings s1 and str, each of length n. Wait, the code says:\n\nString s1 = in.next(), str = in.next();\n\nWait, but in Java, next() reads the next token. So if the input is given as three tokens: n, s1, str, each on the same line, or split across lines? The InputReader's next() reads tokens, so the first next() is n? Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nWait, in the first Java program's main:\n\nint n = in.nextInt(); // reads an integer\n\nthen s1 = in.next(), str = in.next();\n\nSo the input is: first an integer n, then two strings (each of length n?), but the code doesn't check that. So the first program's input is n followed by two strings, each of length n.\n\nWait, the code for the first program:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) b[++cnt] = str.charAt(i);\n\nso str is length n, and s1 is also length n. So the input must have two strings each of length n.\n\nSo the first program's input is: n, then s1, then str, each as separate tokens. So in Fortran, the first part must read n, then read two strings (each of length n). Then process the first step, then pass the result to the second step, etc.\n\nNow, the first step's output is 2*n - len, where len is the minimum of f[cnt], n, n. Wait, the code says:\n\nint len = Math.min(f[cnt], Math.min(n, n));\n\nWhich is redundant, since Math.min(n,n) is n. So len is min(f[cnt], n). So the output is 2n - len.\n\nSo the first program's output is an integer A = 2n - len.\n\nThen the second program takes A as input, and outputs 0 if A is 1, else 1.\n\nThen the third program takes that output (0 or 1) as input, and outputs the next prime after that (with possible bugs as discussed).\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read n, s1, str (each of length n).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (A).\n\n- Then compute the second step's result (B = 0 if A is 1 else 1).\n\n- Then compute the third step's result (C, which is the next prime after B, according to the code's logic).\n\n- Finally, print C.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (the KMP failure function):\n\nThe first Java program's code:\n\nThey have an array b of size N (200+10=210). The code reads str and s1, each of length n, and concatenates them into b (starting at index 1, since Java uses 0-based arrays but the code uses 1-based here). The code then calls getFail(b, cnt), where cnt is 2*n (since each string is n characters, so total 2n elements in b, from 1 to 2n).\n\nThe getFail function computes the failure function for the string b[1..m], where m is cnt (2n). The failure array f is of size N (210), so in Fortran, we can use an array of size 210.\n\nThe failure function is computed as follows:\n\nInitialize f[0] and f[1] to 0.\n\nFor i from 2 to m:\n\n   j starts at f[i-1], but the code uses a loop:\n\n   while j>0 and b[j+1] != b[i], set j = f[j]\n\n   if b[j+1] == b[i], then j +=1\n\n   f[i] = j\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nint j =0;\n\nWait, in the getFail function, the code initializes j=0, then sets f[0] and f[1] to 0. Then for each i from 2 to m:\n\n   while (j>0 and b[j+1] != b[i]) \u2192 j = f[j]\n\n   if (b[j+1] == b[i]) \u2192 j +=1\n\n   f[i] = j\n\nWait, the initial j is 0? Let me see the code again:\n\nWait, the code in getFail:\n\nstatic void getFail(char b[], int m) {\n\n    int j = 0;\n\n    f[0] = f[1] =0;\n\n    for (int i=2; i<=m; i++) {\n\n        while (j>0 && b[j+1] != b[i]) j = f[j];\n\n        if (b[j+1] == b[i]) j++;\n\n        f[i] = j;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the initial j is set to 0 before the loop. Then for each i starting at 2:\n\nThe while loop runs as long as j>0 and the current characters don't match. So j is updated to f[j], which is the previous failure value. Then, after the loop, check if the current characters match. If so, increment j. Then set f[i] to j.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the failure function would need to be implemented similarly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with any lower bound. Let's see:\n\nWe can have arrays f(0:209) (since N is 210, but in Java it's 0-based up to 209?), but in the code, the indices go up to m (which is 2n, up to 200+10=210, but n can be up to 200, so 2n is 400, but the array is size N=210. Wait, that's a problem. Wait in the Java code, the array f is declared as size N=200+10=210. But if n is 200, then 2n is 400, which exceeds the array's size. That's a bug in the Java code. Wait, but perhaps the problem constraints ensure that n is small enough. For example, in the problem AGC006_A, maybe n is up to 200. Let me check the problem's constraints. Since the user hasn't provided that, but the code uses N=200+10, perhaps n is up to 200. So 2n would be 400, but the array is only 210 elements. That's a problem. Wait, but in the code, the array is declared as static int f[] = new int[N]; where N is 210. So if m (the length of the combined string) is 2n, which could be up to 400, then the array is too small. That's a bug in the Java code. But since the user provided the code, I have to replicate it as is. So in Fortran, I'll have to use an array of size 210, but that might cause an error if n is too big. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure n is small enough. Let's proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, the code for the first part would need to:\n\n- Read n, then read two strings s1 and str, each of length n.\n\n- Concatenate str followed by s1 into a character array b (starting at 1, length 2n).\n\n- Compute the failure array f(0:209) (since in Java it's 0-based up to N-1, but the code uses up to m=2n which may exceed 209 if n is 100+).\n\nWait, this is a problem. The code in Java may have a bug here. But since the user provided it, I have to follow it. So in Fortran, perhaps the array is declared as f(0:209), but if 2n exceeds 209, it would be out of bounds. But assuming n is within the problem's constraints, we can proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can have:\n\ninteger, parameter :: N = 210\n\ncharacter(len=N) :: b\n\ninteger :: f(0:N)\n\nThen, after reading the strings, we need to fill b(1:2n) with str followed by s1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let me think:\n\nSuppose s1 and str are read as character arrays of length n each. Then:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   b(i) = str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   b(n + i) = s1(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be concatenated. Alternatively, perhaps read the two strings into variables, then concatenate.\n\nAlternatively, read the two strings as character arrays of length n each, then copy into b.\n\nOnce the b array is built, then compute the failure function.\n\nThe failure function code in Fortran would be:\n\nsubroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: m\n\n   character(len=1), dimension(1:m), intent(in) :: b\n\n   integer, dimension(0:N), intent(out) :: f\n\n   integer :: i, j\n\n   f(0) = 0\n\n   f(1) = 0\n\n   j = 0\n\n   do i = 2, m\n\n      j = f(i-1)  ! Wait, no, the code in Java initializes j to 0 before the loop, but in the loop for each i, the code uses the previous j?\n\nWait, no, looking at the Java code:\n\nInside the getFail function:\n\nfor each i from 2 to m:\n\n   j starts at the previous value? Wait, no. Wait the code in Java:\n\nInside the for loop over i:\n\nThe j is initialized to 0 before the loop. Wait no, the code:\n\nInside getFail:\n\nint j =0;\n\nf[0] = f[1] =0;\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=m; i++) {\n\n    while (j>0 && b[j+1] != b[i]) j = f[j];\n\n    if (b[j+1] == b[i]) j++;\n\n    f[i] = j;\n\n}\n\nWait, the j is initialized to 0 before the loop over i. But inside the loop for each i, the j is updated based on previous steps. Wait, no, the j is reset each time? Wait, no, the code's j is a variable that is modified in each iteration of the for loop. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's j is declared inside getFail, so it's a single variable. So for each i, the code starts with the current j (from previous iteration?), but no, the code's j is initialized to 0 before the loop. Wait no, the code's j is initialized to 0 at the start of getFail, then in the loop for i=2 to m:\n\nAt each i, the code uses the current j (from previous steps?), but no, the code's j is being modified in the while loop for each i.\n\nWait, the code's j is initialized to 0 before the loop over i. Then, for each i starting at 2:\n\nThe code enters the while loop, which may decrease j (by setting j = f[j]) until the condition is met. Then, after the while loop, check if the current characters match, and increment j if so. Then set f[i] = j.\n\nWait, but the j is not reset for each i. So the j is a variable that carries over between iterations of i. That's correct for the KMP failure function.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would need to have j as a variable that persists between iterations of i.\n\nSo the subroutine would be:\n\nsubroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: m\n\n   character(len=1), dimension(1:m), intent(in) :: b\n\n   integer, dimension(0:N), intent(out) :: f\n\n   integer :: i, j\n\n   f(0) = 0\n\n   f(1) = 0\n\n   j = 0\n\n   do i = 2, m\n\n      ! The while loop: while j>0 and b(j+1) /= b(i)\n\n      do while (j > 0 .and. b(j+1) /= b(i))\n\n         j = f(j)\n\n      end do\n\n      if (b(j+1) == b(i)) then\n\n         j = j + 1\n\n      end if\n\n      f(i) = j\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine getFail\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the code uses 1-based indices for b (since in Java, the code uses b[1], etc). So the b array in Fortran is 1-based, so that's okay.\n\nNow, after computing f, the first program's output is 2*n - len, where len is min(f(2*n), n). Because cnt is 2*n (since each string is n characters, so total 2n). So m is 2n, so f(m) is f(2n). The len is min(f(2n), n).\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nint cnt = 0;\n\nfor (i=0 to n-1: cnt increments to 1..n, then adding s1's characters, so total 2n.\n\nThus, the code's len is Math.min(f[cnt], n). Since cnt is 2n, so f[2n].\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing f, the first result A is 2*n - min(f(2*n), n).\n\nThen, the second step is to compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nThird step: compute C as the next prime after B, according to the third Java program's logic.\n\nNow, the third program's code:\n\nThe third program takes an integer x (B here) and outputs the next prime >= x, but with some logic.\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x !=2 and x is even) \u2192 x becomes x+1 (so odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\nwhile true:\n\n   compute sqrt(x) \u2192 sqrtNum.\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrtNum, step 2:\n\n      if x mod i ==0 \u2192 break.\n\n   if after the loop, i > sqrtNum \u2192 then x is prime, break.\n\n   else \u2192 x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n   x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo the loop continues until x is prime.\n\nNow, in Fortran, implementing this:\n\nWe need to write a function or a block of code that takes x (B) and returns the next prime.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize x as B.\n\nIf x is even and not 2 \u2192 set x = x +1 (making it odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\n   compute sqrt_x = sqrt(x)\n\n   is_prime = true\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2:\n\n      if mod(x, i) ==0 \u2192 is_prime = false, break.\n\n   if is_prime \u2192 exit loop, return x.\n\n   else \u2192 x +=2, repeat.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is slightly different. Let me see:\n\nThe code's loop:\n\nfor (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n   if (x%i ==0 \u2192 break;\n\n}\n\nAfter the loop, check if i > sqrtNum \u2192 which would mean that the loop completed without breaking, so x is prime.\n\nElse, it breaks and x is not prime, so increment x by 2.\n\nSo in code terms:\n\nloop:\n\n   compute sqrt_x.\n\n   set i to 3, and loop up to sqrt_x, step 2.\n\n   if any i divides x \u2192 break, and then x +=2.\n\n   else \u2192 done.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can write a loop:\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\ninteger :: x, sqrt_x, i\n\nx = B\n\nif (x == 2) then\n\n   ! 2 is prime, so done.\n\nelse if (mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   sqrt_x = nint(sqrt(real(x)))  ! or use ceiling?\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n         is_prime = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) exit\n\n   x = x +2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, x\n\nWait, but the code in Java uses Math.sqrt(x), which returns a double. The loop in Java uses i up to sqrtNum (the double). So in Fortran, sqrt_x should be the integer part? Or the ceiling?\n\nWait, in Java, the loop runs i from 3 to sqrtNum (double), but since i is an int, the loop will run up to floor(sqrtNum). For example, if sqrt(x) is 4.9, then i goes up to 4. So in Fortran, sqrt_x should be the integer part of sqrt(x). So using nint(sqrt(x)) might be okay, but perhaps better to use floor.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt_x as the integer part of sqrt(x). Let me see:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\nBut in Fortran, sqrt returns a real, so converting to integer truncates.\n\nAlternatively, use ceiling(sqrt(x)) ?\n\nWait, the loop in Java runs i up to sqrtNum (the double). So for example, if sqrt(x) is 4.9, then i will go up to 4.9, so the loop runs i up to 4 (since i is integer). So in Fortran, the upper limit is int(sqrt(x)).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\nThen the loop from 3 to sqrt_x, step 2.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran program structure:\n\nRead n, s1, str.\n\nCompute the first step's A.\n\nCompute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nCompute C via the third step's logic.\n\nPrint C.\n\nNow, handling the strings in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, reading strings can be done with read(*,*) for each, but need to read the two strings after n.\n\nSuppose the input is given as:\n\nn\n\ns1\n\nstr\n\nEach on separate lines.\n\nAlternatively, all on one line. The Java code uses next() which reads tokens, so the first line is n, then the next token is s1, then the next is str. So in Fortran, perhaps read as:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*, '(a)') s1\n\nread(*, '(a)') str\n\nBut need to ensure that s1 and str are exactly length n. So perhaps trimming any trailing spaces.\n\nAlternatively, read the strings as character arrays of length n.\n\nAlternatively, use a read statement that reads exactly n characters for each.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read a string of exactly n characters, you can do:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s1, str\n\nBut n is a variable, so we can't have a character array with variable length. So perhaps use a fixed length, but since n can be up to 200, we can declare them as length 200+.\n\nAlternatively, read into a character array of sufficient length, then take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter for maximum n, say 200, and declare s1 and str as length 200.\n\nWait, the first Java program uses N=210, so n can be up to 200. So in Fortran:\n\nparameter (maxn=200)\n\ncharacter(len=maxn) :: s1, str\n\ninteger :: n\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*, '(a)') s1\n\nread(*, '(a)') str\n\nThen, the strings s1 and str may have trailing spaces if the input is shorter than maxn, but we can take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to read each character.\n\nAlternatively, use a read statement that reads exactly n characters for each string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the safest way is to read the entire line and then take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, when reading a string with '(a)', it reads until the end of the line, so if the user inputs exactly n characters, that's okay. But if they input more, it's a problem. Since the problem requires the strings to be exactly length n, perhaps the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nSo proceed with:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*, '(a)') s1\n\nread(*, '(a)') str\n\nThen, the concatenated string b is str followed by s1, each of length n.\n\nSo in Fortran, the b array can be a character array of length 2*maxn (since n can be up to 200, so 400). But since the Java code uses N=210, which is insufficient for n=200, but perhaps the problem's constraints ensure n is small enough. Alternatively, in Fortran, we can use a dynamic approach, but since arrays in Fortran are fixed, perhaps we can use a large enough array.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum n is 200, the concatenated string is 400 characters, so we can set:\n\nparameter (maxb = 400)\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: b(maxb)\n\nThen, fill b as:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   b(i) = str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   b(n + i) = s1(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are stored as arrays of characters. So s1 is a character(len=200) variable, so s1(1:i) is the ith character.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the failure array f is declared as integer f(0:maxb), since m can be up to 2*200=400. Wait, but the original Java code uses N=210, which is insufficient. But since the user provided the code, perhaps the problem's constraints ensure n is small enough. Alternatively, in Fortran, we can use a larger array. Let's set the parameter N to 400 to be safe.\n\nparameter (N = 400)\n\ninteger :: f(0:N)\n\nThen call the getFail subroutine with m = 2*n.\n\nAfter computing f, compute A = 2*n - min(f(2*n), n).\n\nThen compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nThen compute C via the third step's logic.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\nWe need to compute C given B.\n\nThe code for the third step is:\n\nx = B\n\nif (x ==1) then \u2192 since B is either 0 or 1.\n\nWait, B can be 0 or 1.\n\nWait, B is 0 when A is 1, else 1.\n\nSo possible B values are 0 or 1.\n\nSo for B=0:\n\nx starts as 0.\n\nThe code's first condition:\n\nif (x !=2 and x is even) \u2192 0 is even and not 2 \u2192 so x becomes 1.\n\nThen enter the loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(1) \u2192 1.\n\nloop i from 3 to 1 \u2192 doesn't run.\n\nso i remains 3.\n\nthen check if i>sqrt_x (3>1 \u2192 yes). So exit loop, so x is 1, which is considered prime. So output 1.\n\nBut 1 is not a prime. But the code would output it.\n\nFor B=1:\n\nx starts as 1.\n\nThe code's first condition: x is not 2, and is odd (since 1 is odd). So no change.\n\nThen enter the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1.\n\nloop i from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations.\n\nso i is 3, which is >1 \u2192 so x is considered prime. So output 1.\n\nBut again, 1 is not a prime. So the code's output for B=1 is 1.\n\nWait, but the third program's code would output 1 in both cases (B=0 or 1). But according to the code's logic, that's what happens.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nCase B=0:\n\nx starts as 0 \u2192 becomes 1 (since even and not 2). Then the loop checks 1, which is considered prime \u2192 output 1.\n\nCase B=1:\n\nx is 1 \u2192 not even, so no change. Then the loop checks 1, which is considered prime \u2192 output 1.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the third program outputs 1?\n\nWait, but let's see the code again for B=1:\n\nx =1.\n\nThe first condition: x !=2 and even? 1 is not even, so no. So x remains 1.\n\nThen enter the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1.\n\nThe for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nThus, after the loop, i is 3, which is > sqrt_x (1). So the condition is met, so break the while loop. Thus, x is 1, which is output.\n\nSo the third program's output is 1 in both cases.\n\nWait, but what if B is 0 or 1, the third program's output is 1 in both cases?\n\nHmm, that's what the code does. So the final output is always 1?\n\nWait, but let me check the code again for B=0:\n\nx starts as 0 \u2192 since it's even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 1.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1.\n\nThe for loop runs from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. So i remains 3.\n\nThus, i>sqrt_x (3>1 \u2192 yes). So x is 1 is considered prime \u2192 output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final output is always 1, regardless of the first two steps?\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs A=1 \u2192 B=0 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nIf the first program outputs A=2 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nIf the first program outputs A=0 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nWait, so the third program's output is always 1?\n\nHmm, that's strange. But according to the code's logic, yes. Because for B=0 or 1, the third program's output is 1.\n\nWait, but what if B is 2?\n\nWait, but in our case, B can only be 0 or 1. Because the second program's output is 0 if A is 1, else 1. So A can be any integer, but B is 0 or 1.\n\nThus, the third program's output is always 1.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. Because the third program's code for x=1 would output 1, but 1 is not a prime. So the code has a bug. But according to the problem's given code, that's how it is. So the final output is always 1?\n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, let me re-express the third program's code for B=0:\n\nx starts as 0.\n\nThe first condition: x !=2 and even \u2192 yes. So x becomes 1.\n\nThen the loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(1) \u2192 1.\n\nfor i from 3 to 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nso after the loop, i is 3, which is >1 \u2192 so break the while loop. So x is 1 is considered prime \u2192 output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nFor B=1:\n\nx is 1.\n\nThe first condition: x is not even \u2192 so no change.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1.\n\nfor i from 3 to 1 \u2192 no loop.\n\nso i is 3>1 \u2192 break. So output 1.\n\nThus, the third program's output is always 1 when B is 0 or 1.\n\nSo the final output of the entire sequence is always 1?\n\nWait, but that's strange. Let me see the second program's code again.\n\nSecond program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n\n    boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n\n    int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\n    out.println(result);\n\n    out.flush();\n\n}\n\nWait, the result is computed as:\n\nresult = (!bool) ? 1 : 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nbool is true when x is 1.\n\nSo !bool is false when x is 1 \u2192 so result is 0.\n\nElse, when x is not 1 \u2192 !bool is true \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo the second program's output is 0 when x is 1, else 1.\n\nThus, the second program's output B is 0 if A is 1, else 1.\n\nThus, B can be 0 or 1.\n\nThus, the third program's input is B (0 or 1), and outputs 1 in both cases.\n\nThus, the final output is always 1?\n\nHmm, that's the case according to the code.\n\nSo the entire sequence's output is 1, unless there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, but let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is A=1 \u2192 B=0 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is A=2 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is A=0 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third program outputs 1.\n\nThus, the final output is always 1.\n\nHmm, that's odd. But according to the code's logic, that's correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran program will always output 1, regardless of the first two steps?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the third program's code analysis.\n\nWait, let's see for B=0:\n\nThe third program's input is 0.\n\nThe code:\n\nx = 0.\n\nif (x !=2 and x%2 ==0 \u2192 yes \u2192 x becomes 1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(1) \u2192 1.\n\nfor i from 3 to 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nso after the loop, i is 3, which is >1 \u2192 so break the while loop. Thus, x is 1 is considered prime \u2192 output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: B=2 (though in our case it can't happen, but just to see):\n\nx=2 \u2192 even and not 2? No, so no change.\n\nThen loop:\n\nsqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 int(1.414) is 1.\n\nloop i from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations.\n\nso i is 3>1 \u2192 so x is considered prime \u2192 output 2, which is correct.\n\nBut in our case, B can't be 2.\n\nThus, the final output is always 1.\n\nHmm, that's the case. So the entire sequence's output is 1 unless there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nBut the user provided the code, so I have to follow it.\n\nThus, the Fortran program will compute the first step's A, then B, then compute C=1, and output it.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, when B is 0 or 1, the output is 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nThus, the Fortran program can be written as follows.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: maxn = 200, maxb = 400, N = 400\n\n   character(len=maxn) :: s1, str\n\n   character(len=1) :: b(maxb)\n\n   integer :: n, f(0:N), A, B, C, i, j, m, sqrt_x, x, is_prime\n\n   ! Read input\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   read(*, '(a)') s1\n\n   read(*, '(a)') str\n\n   ! Fill b array\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      b(i) = str(i:i)\n\n   end do\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      b(n + i) = s1(i:i)\n\n   end do\n\n   m = 2*n\n\n   ! Compute failure function\n\n   call getFail(b(1:m), m, f)\n\n   ! Compute A = 2*n - min(f(m), n)\n\n   A = 2*n - min(f(m), n)\n\n   ! Compute B\n\n   if (A == 1) then\n\n      B = 0\n\n   else\n\n      B = 1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Compute C via third program's logic\n\n   x = B\n\n   if (x == 2) then\n\n      ! do nothing, x is already prime\n\n   else if (mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n      x = x +1\n\n   end if\n\n   do while (.true.)\n\n      sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n      is_prime = 1  ! Assume prime until proven otherwise\n\n      do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n         if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n            is_prime = 0\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (is_prime ==1) exit\n\n      x = x +2\n\n   end do\n\n   C = x\n\n   ! Output C\n\n   print *, C\n\ncontains\n\n   subroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: m\n\n      character(len=1), dimension(1:m), intent(in) :: b\n\n      integer, dimension(0:N), intent(out) :: f\n\n      integer :: i, j\n\n      f(0) = 0\n\n      f(1) = 0\n\n      j = 0\n\n      do i = 2, m\n\n         do while (j >0 .and. b(j+1) /= b(i))\n\n            j = f(j)\n\n         end do\n\n         if (b(j+1) == b(i)) then\n\n            j = j +1\n\n         end if\n\n         f(i) = j\n\n      end do\n\n   end subroutine getFail\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third step's code, I used an integer is_prime (1 or 0). Alternatively, a logical variable.\n\nWait, in the code above, I set is_prime to 1 initially, then set to 0 if a divisor is found. Then check if is_prime is 1 to exit.\n\nAlternatively, using a logical variable:\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\nis_prime = .true.\n\nthen inside the loop:\n\nif (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n   is_prime = .false.\n\n   exit\n\nend if\n\nthen after the loop:\n\nif (is_prime) exit\n\nBut in the code above, I used an integer for simplicity.\n\nNow, testing the code for B=0 and B=1:\n\nFor B=0:\n\nx starts as 0 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThen in the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = 1.\n\ni starts at 3, which is >1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nThus, is_prime remains 1 \u2192 exit loop. So C=1.\n\nFor B=1:\n\nx=1 \u2192 not even \u2192 no change.\n\nsqrt_x=1.\n\nloop from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations.\n\nis_prime remains 1 \u2192 exit. So C=1.\n\nThus, the code works as intended.\n\nThus, this Fortran program should replicate the behavior of the three Java programs in sequence."
