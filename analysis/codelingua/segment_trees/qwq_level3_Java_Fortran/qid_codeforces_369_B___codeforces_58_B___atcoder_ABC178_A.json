Wait, but in Java, the outer loop is:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {\n\n   idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk>0 && idx >= n-k) {\n\n      ... \n\n   }\n\n} So each time the outer loop runs, it starts at the end and tries to distribute as much as possible.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_369_B) reads several integers from input, processes them through the getPoints function, and outputs an array of integers. The second file (codeforces_58_B) takes an integer n, then outputs numbers in a decreasing sequence until it hits 1, but only if each step divides the previous. The third file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1, and outputs 0 or 1 accordingly.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But in Fortran, I have to do this all in one program without intermediate I/O except for the first and last steps.\n\nHmm, the first program's output is an array of integers. The second program expects an integer n as input. Wait, how does the first program's output feed into the second? The first program's output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. The second program's input is a single integer n. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's main method: it reads n from input, then prints n followed by the sequence. Wait, the first line in the second program's main is \"int n = sc.nextInt();\", so the input for the second program is the first integer from the first program's output array. Wait, but the first program outputs an array, so the second program's input is the first element of that array? Or maybe the entire array is passed as input? Wait, no, the second program's first line is reading an integer n, so the input to the second program is the first integer from the first program's output. But the first program's output is a list of numbers, so the second program would read the first number as n, then the rest are ignored? Or maybe the second program is expecting the entire array as input? Wait, no, looking at the second Java program's code, it's expecting a single integer n as input. So the first program's output is an array, but the second program only takes the first element of that array as its n. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a sequence of numbers, and the second program reads the first number as its n. Then the second program's output is a sequence of numbers, and the third program takes the first number of that as its x?\n\nWait, the third program's input is a single integer x. So the chain is:\n\nFirst program's output is a list of integers. The second program takes the first integer from that list as its n. The second program's output is a list of integers (the sequence), and the third program takes the first integer from that as x. Then the third program outputs 0 or 1.\n\nWait, but the second program's code: in its main, after reading n, it prints n followed by the sequence. Wait, the code for the second program's main is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = sc.nextInt();\n    System.out.println(n + \" \");\n    int m = n;\n    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n        if (m % i == 0) {\n            System.out.println(i + \" \");\n            m = i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first line after reading n is System.out.println(n + \" \");. So the output of the second program is the n followed by the sequence. But the third program expects a single integer x. So the third program would read the first number from the second's output, which is the original n again. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on a new line, but the third program reads the first number from that sequence. Wait, but the second program's output is n followed by the numbers in the sequence. So the first number in the output is n, then the next numbers are the sequence. So the third program would take the first number (n) again? That would mean the third program's input is the same as the second's input. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the flow here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's output is a single integer, but looking at the code, it's printing multiple numbers. Wait, the code for the second program's main has a print statement for n, then in the loop, it prints each i that divides m. So the output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces (since each print statement ends with \" \" followed by a space?), but actually, the code uses System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print n followed by a space and a new line? Wait, no, the code says System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print n followed by a space, then a new line. Then in the loop, each time it finds a divisor, it does System.out.println(i + \" \"); which again appends a space and a new line. So the output is a series of numbers each on their own line with a trailing space. But the third program expects a single integer x. So perhaps the third program is taking the first number from the second's output, which is the original n again. That would mean the third program's input is the same as the second's input. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence of programs. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output is an array of integers, which is passed as input to the second program. The second program reads that array as its input, but in its code, it only reads the first integer (n) from the input. The rest of the input is ignored. Then the second program's output is a sequence of numbers (starting with n, then the sequence), which is passed to the third program. The third program reads the first integer from that sequence (the first number, which is n again?), and outputs 0 or 1 based on whether that is 1.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n    boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n    int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n    out.println(result);\n    out.flush();\n}\n\nSo it reads an integer x from input, then outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1. So the third program's input is the first integer from the second program's output. The second program's output starts with n (the first number it printed), so the third program's x is the n from the second program's input. Wait, but the second program's input is the first program's output array. So the first program's output array's first element is the n that the second program reads. Then the second program's output starts with that same n, so the third program's x is that n. So the third program's output is 0 if that n is 1, else 1.\n\nHmm, okay. So the entire chain's output is 0 or 1, depending on whether the first element of the first program's output array is 1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output array is generated based on the inputs given to it. Let me think through the steps again.\n\nThe first program's inputs are n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. It produces an array ans. The second program takes the first element of ans as its n. Then the second program's output is a sequence starting with that n, then the sequence of divisors. The third program takes the first element of that sequence (the same n) and outputs 0 or 1 based on whether it's 1.\n\nSo the final output is 0 if the first element of the first program's output array is 1, else 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial inputs (the first program's inputs), process through all three steps, and output the final 0 or 1.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's main reads n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. Then calls getPoints and outputs the array.\n\nThe getPoints function initializes an array ans of size n, filled with l. Then subtracts sk + (n -k)*l from sAll. Then sk is adjusted by subtracting k*l. Then there are loops to distribute the remaining sk and sAll.\n\nWait, let me parse the getPoints function step by step.\n\nThe function:\n\npublic static int[] getPoints(int n, int k, int l, int r, int sAll, int sk) {\n    int[] ans = new int[n];\n    Arrays.fill(ans, l);\n    sAll -= sk + (n - k)*l;\n    sk -= k*l;\n    while (sk > 0) {\n        int idx = n -1;\n        while (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) {\n            ans[idx] +=1;\n            sk--;\n            idx--;\n        }\n    }\n    while (sAll >0) {\n        int idx =0;\n        while (sAll>0 && idx < n -k) {\n            ans[idx] +=1;\n            sAll--;\n            idx++;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, the first step is filling ans with l. Then sAll is reduced by sk plus (n -k)*l. Wait, the initial sAll is the total sum of all elements? Or perhaps the problem's parameters are such that the initial setup is ans filled with l, so the sum is n*l. Then the problem requires that the total sum is sAll, and the first k elements must sum to sk. So the code is adjusting the values to meet these constraints.\n\nThe code first sets all elements to l. Then the total sum is n*l. The sum of the first k elements is k*l. The remaining (n-k) elements are l each, so their sum is (n-k)*l. The total sAll is given, so the code subtracts sk (the desired sum of first k elements) plus (n-k)*l (the sum of the rest) from sAll. Wait, perhaps the initial setup is that the first k elements are to be adjusted to sum to sk, and the rest to l. But I'm not sure. The code's logic is a bit involved.\n\nBut for the Fortran translation, I need to replicate the same steps.\n\nNow, the second Java program's code:\n\nIt reads an integer n, then outputs n followed by the sequence of numbers in decreasing order where each divides the previous. The output is a list of numbers starting with n, then each next number is the largest possible divisor less than the previous, etc., until 1.\n\nThe third program takes the first number from that output (which is n) and outputs 0 if it's 1, else 1.\n\nSo the final output is 0 if the first element of the first program's output array is 1, else 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial inputs (n, k, l, r, sAll, sk) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the array ans using the same logic as the first Java program.\n\n3. Take the first element of ans (ans(1) in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based?), and use that as the input to the second step.\n\nWait, in Java arrays are 0-based. The first element of the array ans in Java is ans[0], which corresponds to the first element in the output. So in Fortran, if we use 1-based arrays, the first element would be ans(1).\n\nWait, in the first Java program's output, the for loop is for (int num : ans) { System.out.print(num + \" \"); }, so the elements are printed in order from ans[0] to ans[n-1]. So the first element of the array (ans[0]) is the first number in the output.\n\nTherefore, the second program's input is the first element of the array (ans[0]), which in Fortran would be ans(1) if the array is 1-based.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based by default. So when translating, I need to make sure that the first element of the array is correctly handled.\n\nSo the second step in the Fortran program is to take that first element (let's call it n_val) and process it through the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is to generate a sequence starting with n_val, then each next number is the largest possible divisor less than the current, etc. The output of this step is a list starting with n_val, then the sequence. The third step takes the first element of this list (n_val again) and checks if it's 1.\n\nWait, but the second program's output starts with n_val, so the third program's input is n_val. Therefore, the final output is 0 if n_val is 1, else 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read the initial inputs (n, k, l, r, sAll, sk).\n\n- Compute the array ans using the first program's logic.\n\n- Take the first element of ans (ans(1) in Fortran) as n_val.\n\n- Then, process n_val through the second program's logic to get the sequence, but since the third program only needs the first element (n_val), we can skip the second program's processing except for the part that determines the first element. Wait, no, the second program's output is the sequence starting with n_val, so the third program's input is the first element of that sequence, which is n_val. Therefore, the second program's processing doesn't change the first element. So the third program's input is n_val, so the final output is 0 if n_val is 1, else 1.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! The second program's output starts with the same n_val that it received as input. Therefore, the third program's input is exactly n_val, so the final output is 0 if n_val is 1, else 1. Therefore, the second program's processing is irrelevant for the final result except for the first element. Therefore, in the Fortran program, I can skip the second program's processing entirely and just take the first element of the first program's output array and check if it's 1.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the second program's output starts with the same n_val. Let me confirm the second program's code again.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt(); // reads the first number from input (the first element of the first program's array)\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \"); // outputs n followed by a space and a new line\nint m = n;\nfor (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n    if (m%i ==0) {\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n        m =i;\n    }\n}\n\nSo the first output is n, then the rest of the numbers. So the third program reads the first number from the second's output, which is n. So the third program's x is n, which is the first element of the first program's array. Therefore, the entire chain's final output is 0 if that first element is 1, else 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be simplified to:\n\nRead the inputs for the first program, compute the first element of the array ans, then output 0 if it's 1 else 1.\n\nWait, that's a huge simplification! So the second and third programs' processing can be bypassed except for the first element of the first array. Therefore, the Fortran program can ignore the second and third steps except for taking the first element of the first array and outputting 0 or 1 based on that.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the first program's first element is 5. The second program's output starts with 5, so the third program's x is 5, so it outputs 0 if 5 is 1 (no, so outputs 1). So the final output is 1. So yes, the final output is 1 if the first element of the first array is not 1, else 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire process can be reduced to just computing the first element of the first program's array and then outputting 0 or 1 based on that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the inputs (n, k, l, r, sAll, sk).\n\nCompute the array ans using the first program's logic.\n\nTake the first element of ans (ans(1)), then output 0 if it is 1, else 1.\n\nThis would replicate the entire chain's behavior without needing to process the second and third steps.\n\nBut wait, is there any case where the first element of the array could be modified by the second program's processing? For example, if the second program's processing somehow changes the first element? No, because the second program's input is the first element of the first array, and its output starts with that same value. So the third program's input is exactly that first element. Therefore, the entire chain's final output depends only on the first element of the first array.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute that first element and output accordingly.\n\nThis is a crucial realization. So now, the problem reduces to translating the first Java program's getPoints function into Fortran, compute the first element of the resulting array, then output 0 or 1 based on that.\n\nNow, let's focus on translating the first program's getPoints function into Fortran.\n\nThe first program's getPoints function:\n\nParameters: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Initialize an array ans of size n, filled with l.\n\n2. sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\n3. sk = sk - (k * l)\n\n4. While sk >0:\n\n   a. Start at index n-1 (Java's 0-based, so in Fortran, which is 1-based, it would be n)\n\n   b. While sk>0 and idx >= (n -k) (since in Java, n -k is the starting point for the k elements? Wait, the loop in Java is:\n\n   while (sk >0) {\n\n       int idx = n-1;\n\n       while (sk>0 && idx >= n -k) {\n\n           ans[idx] +=1\n\n           sk -=1\n\n           idx -=1\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nWait, in Java, the indices go from 0 to n-1. The inner loop starts at idx = n-1 (the last element), and while sk>0 and idx >= (n -k), which is the starting index for the first of the k elements? Because n -k would be the starting index for the first of the k elements? For example, if n=5 and k=2, then n-k=3, so indices 3 and 4 (since 0-based) are the first two elements? Wait no, that would be the last two elements. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to distribute the remaining sk among the last k elements (the first k elements? Not sure).\n\nWait, the code's logic after initializing ans to l:\n\nThe first part is to adjust sk and sAll.\n\nThe initial sk is the desired sum of the first k elements. Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the first k elements must sum to exactly sk, and the total sum of all elements must be sAll. The initial setup is all elements set to l, so the first k elements sum to k*l, and the rest (n-k) elements sum to (n-k)*l. The total is n*l. The code then subtracts sk + (n-k)*l from sAll, which would be sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). But I'm not sure of the exact problem constraints, but the code is written this way.\n\nThe code then adjusts sk by subtracting k*l (since sk was the desired sum, but the initial first k elements sum to k*l, so the remaining sk is sk - k*l? Wait, no, the code does sk -= k*l. So sk is now sk_initial - k*l. Then, the while loop for sk>0: the code increments the last elements (starting from the end) to distribute the remaining sk.\n\nWait, the code's logic for sk:\n\nAfter the initial setup, the first k elements are l each, so their sum is k*l. The desired sum for them is sk. So the difference is sk - k*l. But the code subtracts k*l from sk, so sk becomes sk_initial - k*l. Then, the while loop adds 1 to the last elements (starting from the end) until sk is exhausted. Each increment adds 1 to sk's contribution. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to increase the first k elements to reach the desired sk.\n\nWait, the code's first part:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l;\n\nWait, that's sAll = sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). The initial total is n*l. The desired total is sAll. So after subtracting sk (the desired first k elements sum) and (n-k)*l (the sum of the rest), the remaining sAll is the total needed beyond that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to first set the first k elements to their minimal possible (l) and the rest to l, then distribute the remaining sk and sAll.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is structured to first set all elements to l, then adjust the first k elements to reach sk, and the rest to reach sAll.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic must be translated accurately.\n\nNow, translating the getPoints function into Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So the array ans will be of size n, with indices 1 to n.\n\nThe steps:\n\nInitialize ans(1:n) = l.\n\nCompute sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\nsk = sk - k*l\n\nThen, while sk >0:\n\n   idx = n (since in Java it's n-1, which is the last element, so in Fortran it's n)\n\n   while sk >0 and idx >= (n -k +1) ?\n\nWait, in Java, the condition is idx >= n -k. Since in Java, the indices are 0-based, the first k elements are from 0 to k-1, and the last k elements are from n-k to n-1. Wait, perhaps the code is distributing the sk among the last k elements? Because the inner loop starts at the end (idx = n-1) and goes backward until idx >= n -k (which is the starting point for the last k elements). So in Java, the last k elements are from index n-k to n-1. So in Fortran, the indices would be from (n -k +1) to n.\n\nTherefore, the condition in the inner loop is idx >= (n -k) in Java (0-based), which translates to idx >= (n -k) +1 in Fortran (since Fortran starts at 1). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nJava's indices for the last k elements are from (n -k) to (n-1). In Fortran, those would be (n -k +1) to n. So the condition in the inner loop in Fortran would be idx >= (n -k +1).\n\nWait, the Java code's inner loop condition is:\n\nwhile (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) {\n\nSo in Java, the starting idx is n-1 (the last element), and it goes down to n -k (the first element of the last k elements). So in Fortran, the starting idx is n, and the condition is idx >= (n -k). Wait, but in Fortran, the first element of the last k elements is (n -k +1). So the condition in Fortran would be idx >= (n -k +1).\n\nWait, let me see with an example. Suppose n=5, k=2. Then in Java, the last k elements are indices 3 and 4 (since n-k=3, and n-1=4). In Fortran, those are indices 4 and 5. So the starting idx is 5 (Fortran's n), and the condition is idx >= (n -k +1) = 5-2+1=4. So yes, the condition in Fortran would be idx >= (n -k +1).\n\nTherefore, the inner loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n   ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n   sk = sk -1\n\n   idx = idx -1\n\nend do\n\nThe outer loop continues while sk >0. But in Java, the outer loop is a while loop that runs as long as sk>0, and in each iteration, it starts at the end and moves backward until sk is exhausted or the indices are out of the last k elements.\n\nWait, but in Java, the outer loop is a while loop that runs while sk>0. Each iteration of the outer loop starts at the end (idx = n-1) and decrements until sk is 0 or the indices are out of the last k elements. But in Fortran, the same logic can be implemented with a loop.\n\nWait, but in Java, the outer loop is:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {\n\n   idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk>0 && idx >= n-k) {\n\n      ... \n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo each time the outer loop runs, it starts at the end and tries to distribute as much as possible. But in Fortran, perhaps we can do the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outer loop can be replaced with a single pass, but I think it's better to translate it as is.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo while (sk >0)\n\n   idx = n\n\n   do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n      sk = sk -1\n\n      idx = idx -1\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, the next loop for sAll:\n\nwhile (sAll >0) {\n\n   idx =0;\n\n   while (sAll>0 && idx < n -k) {\n\n      ans[idx] +=1\n\n      sAll -=1\n\n      idx +=1\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the first part:\n\ndo while (sAll >0)\n\n   idx =1\n\n   do while (sAll >0 .and. idx < (n -k))\n\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n      sAll = sAll -1\n\n      idx = idx +1\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Java, the inner loop starts at idx=0 (the first element) and goes up to (n -k -1), since the condition is idx < n -k. Because in Java, the first (n -k) elements are the first part (since the last k are from n-k to n-1). So in Fortran, the first (n -k) elements are indices 1 to (n -k). So the condition in the inner loop is idx < (n -k). Since in Fortran, the indices start at 1, the loop runs while idx is less than (n -k). So the starting idx is 1, and increments until it reaches (n -k). So the condition is idx < (n -k). So the loop runs for idx from 1 to (n -k -1), since when idx reaches (n -k), the condition is false.\n\nWait, let me see with an example. If n=5, k=2, then n -k =3. So in Java, the first part (non-last k elements) are indices 0,1,2 (since n-k is 3, so indices less than 3). In Fortran, those are indices 1,2,3. So the loop runs while idx <3 (since n-k is 3). So idx starts at 1, increments to 2, then 3. When idx is 3, the condition 3 <3 is false, so the loop stops. So the elements 1,2 are incremented. Wait, but in Java, the loop runs while idx < n-k (3), so indices 0,1,2 (Java's 0-based). So in Fortran, the indices 1,2,3 (since 3 <3 is false, so stops at 2). Hmm, perhaps the condition in Fortran should be idx <= (n -k). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in Java, the inner loop for sAll is:\n\nwhile (sAll>0 && idx < n -k) {\n\n   ans[idx] +=1\n\n   sAll -=1\n\n   idx +=1\n\n}\n\nSo the loop runs as long as idx is less than (n -k). So for n=5, k=2, n-k=3, so idx can be 0,1,2 (Java indices). So in Fortran, the indices are 1,2,3. The condition is idx <3 (since n-k is 3). So in Fortran, the loop runs while idx <3, so idx can be 1,2. The third element (3) is not included. Wait, that's a problem. Because in Java, the first (n-k) elements are 0 to (n-k-1). So in Fortran, the first (n-k) elements are 1 to (n-k). So the loop should run while idx <= (n-k). Wait, perhaps the condition in Fortran should be idx <= (n -k). Let me think:\n\nIn Java, the loop runs while idx < (n -k). So the maximum idx is (n -k -1). In Fortran, the corresponding index is (n -k). Because Java's (n-k-1) is Fortran's (n -k). For example, n=5, k=2: n-k is 3. Java's maximum idx is 2 (3-1), which is Fortran's 3 (2+1). So the Fortran condition should be idx <= (n -k). Because in Fortran, the indices for the first (n-k) elements are 1 to (n-k). So the loop should run while idx <= (n -k). Wait, but the original code in Java uses <, so in Fortran, it's <= ?\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nJava's condition: idx < (n -k) \u2192 in Fortran, the equivalent is idx <= (n -k) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's indices for the first (n-k) elements are 0 to (n-k-1). So the maximum index is (n-k-1). In Fortran, those indices are 1 to (n-k). So the maximum index in Fortran is (n-k). So to cover all those elements, the loop in Fortran should run while idx <= (n-k). But the original code in Java uses <, so the equivalent in Fortran would be <= ?\n\nYes. Because in Java, the loop runs while idx is less than (n-k), which is the count of elements. So in Fortran, the loop should run while idx is less than or equal to (n-k). Wait, no, the count is (n-k) elements, so the indices go up to (n-k). So the condition in Fortran should be idx <= (n-k). Therefore, the inner loop in Fortran for the sAll part is:\n\ndo while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial idx is set to 0 in Java, which is 1 in Fortran. Wait, in Java, the inner loop starts at idx=0 (the first element). In Fortran, the starting idx is 1. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\nidx =1\n\ndo while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n   ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n   sAll = sAll -1\n\n   idx = idx +1\n\nend do\n\nYes, that way, the loop runs for indices 1 to (n-k), which corresponds to the first (n-k) elements in Java.\n\nTherefore, the code for the sAll loop in Fortran is:\n\ndo while (sAll >0)\n\n   idx =1\n\n   do while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n      sAll = sAll -1\n\n      idx = idx +1\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the inputs: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk.\n\n2. Initialize an array ans of size n, all elements set to l.\n\n3. Compute sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\n   sk = sk - k*l\n\n4. Process sk:\n\n   do while (sk >0)\n\n      idx = n\n\n      do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sk = sk -1\n\n         idx = idx -1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n5. Process sAll:\n\n   do while (sAll >0)\n\n      idx =1\n\n      do while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sAll = sAll -1\n\n         idx = idx +1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n6. The first element of ans is ans(1). Output 0 if it is 1, else 1.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nBut first, note that in Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. So we need to read n first, then allocate the array. But since the first input is n, we can read it first, then read the rest.\n\nWait, the inputs are n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. So the order is:\n\nRead n, then k, l, r, sAll, sk.\n\nWait, the first Java program's main reads:\n\nint n = scan.nextInt();\n\nint k = scan.nextInt();\n\nint l = scan.nextInt();\n\nint r = scan.nextInt();\n\nint sAll = scan.nextInt();\n\nint sk = scan.nextInt();\n\nSo in Fortran, the input order is the same.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   integer, allocatable :: ans(:)\n\n   integer :: first_element\n\n   ! Read inputs\n\n   read(*,*) n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   ! Allocate array ans of size n\n\n   allocate(ans(n))\n\n   ! Initialize ans to l\n\n   ans = l\n\n   ! Compute sAll and sk adjustments\n\n   sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\n   sk = sk - k*l\n\n   ! Process sk\n\n   do while (sk >0)\n\n      integer :: idx\n\n      idx = n\n\n      do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sk = sk -1\n\n         idx = idx -1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Process sAll\n\n   do while (sAll >0)\n\n      integer :: idx\n\n      idx =1\n\n      do while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sAll = sAll -1\n\n         idx = idx +1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Get the first element\n\n   first_element = ans(1)\n\n   ! Output 0 if first_element is 1 else 1\n\n   if (first_element ==1) then\n\n      print*, 0\n\n   else\n\n      print*, 1\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the sk processing loop, the variable idx is declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables declared inside a loop are local to that loop. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the first do while loop (processing sk), the idx is declared inside the loop. So each iteration of the outer loop will re-declare idx, which is okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. So in the first loop:\n\ndo while (sk >0)\n\n   integer :: idx\n\n   idx = n\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\nThis is allowed in Fortran 90 and later, where variables can be declared in blocks. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe, perhaps declare idx outside. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, declare idx before the loops.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   integer, allocatable :: ans(:)\n\n   integer :: first_element, idx\n\n   ! Read inputs\n\n   read(*,*) n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   ! Allocate array ans of size n\n\n   allocate(ans(n))\n\n   ! Initialize ans to l\n\n   ans = l\n\n   ! Compute sAll and sk adjustments\n\n   sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\n   sk = sk - k*l\n\n   ! Process sk\n\n   do while (sk >0)\n\n      idx = n\n\n      do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sk = sk -1\n\n         idx = idx -1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Process sAll\n\n   do while (sAll >0)\n\n      idx =1\n\n      do while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n         ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n         sAll = sAll -1\n\n         idx = idx +1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Get the first element\n\n   first_element = ans(1)\n\n   ! Output 0 if first_element is 1 else 1\n\n   if (first_element ==1) then\n\n      print*, 0\n\n   else\n\n      print*, 1\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nThis way, idx is declared once outside the loops. That's better.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nSuppose the first element of ans is 1. Then output is 0.\n\nIf it's anything else, output is 1.\n\nNow, let's see if the code correctly handles the first element.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first Java program's getPoints function, the initial ans array is filled with l. Then, the sk and sAll are adjusted. The code then distributes the remaining sk and sAll.\n\nThe first element of the array (ans[0] in Java, ans(1) in Fortran) is part of the first (n-k) elements if k is not zero. Wait, the first k elements are the last k elements in the array? Or the first k elements?\n\nLooking back at the code's sk processing loop:\n\nThe sk processing loop is distributing the remaining sk into the last k elements (since the loop starts at the end and goes backward until the last k elements). The first k elements (in terms of the array's order) are the last k elements of the array. So the first element of the array (ans(1)) is part of the first (n-k) elements, unless n-k is zero.\n\nTherefore, the first element is part of the first (n-k) elements, which are handled in the sAll processing loop.\n\nWait, the sAll processing loop increments the first (n-k) elements (indices 1 to (n-k)), distributing the remaining sAll.\n\nSo the first element (ans(1)) is part of the first (n-k) elements and can be increased by the sAll loop.\n\nTherefore, the code correctly captures the first element's value.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
