So the last element is len+1. So when i is len+1, then i+1 is len+2, which is beyond the array. So in that case, when processing the else clause (digits(i) >5), we can't do the increment. So in the code, we need to check if i < len+1 before incrementing. Wait, in the else clause (digits(i) >5):\n\nbills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\nif (i < len+1) then\n\n    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as:\n\ndigits[i + 1]++;\n\nSo in the code, it's done unconditionally. So in Fortran, to replicate that, even if it's out of bounds, but since we can't do that, perhaps the code is intended to have the array size sufficient. But given that the original code may have a bug, but we have to translate it as is. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can't be greater than 9, so the else clause (digits[i] >5) would not trigger the increment. But that's not necessarily true. Hmm, this is a bit of a problem, but perhaps proceed with the code as written, and in Fortran, when i is the last element (i = len+1), the code will have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can be 10 (due to a carry from previous digits). For example, if the previous digit had a carry, then digits[i] could be 10, so the first condition (digits[i] ==10) would trigger, setting digits[i] to 0 and incrementing digits[i+1], which is beyond the array. So that's a bug. Hmm, perhaps the code is intended to have the loop up to i < number.length() +1, but written as <=. So in Fortran, the loop should be from i=1 to len+1, but when i is len+1, the digits[i+1] is out of bounds. To avoid that, perhaps the loop should be up to i = len, but that's not matching the original code. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so the last element is digits[len+1], and the loop runs up to i = len+1 (in Fortran terms). So when i is len+1, the digits[i] can be processed, but the digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed with the code as written, and in Fortran, when i is the last element, the code will have an error. But since the problem says to translate the code, perhaps the code is correct in the original context. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can't be 10 or greater than 5. But I'm not sure.",

So when processing the last digit (i = number.length()), if digits[i] is 10 (due to a carry from previous digits), then it would set digits[i] to 0 and increment digits[i+1], which is beyond the array. So that's a bug. Hmm, this is a problem. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps I should proceed as per the code's logic, even if it has a bug. But in the given Java code, perhaps the loop is written correctly. Wait, in the original code's loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    ... other conditions\n\n}\n\ndigits has length number.length() +1. So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()]).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_327_A) reads input: an integer n followed by n integers. It processes them by checking all possible subarrays, flipping 0s and 1s in those ranges, then counts the maximum number of 1s. The output is this max count, except when n is 1, it outputs 0 or 1 based on the single element.\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1, and outputs 0 if it is, else 1. Wait, but how does this connect? The output of the first program is the input to the second? Wait, the user said the output of each is input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is input to the third. The final output is the third's result.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second. The second takes that number as x, and outputs 0 or 1. Then that result is the input to the third program, which expects a number (probably the x from the second's output?), but looking at the third program's code, it reads a string (number) which is a digit string. Wait, the third program's first line is \"String number = sc.next();\", so it expects a string input, like a number as a string. Hmm, so the second program's output is a single integer (0 or 1), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string, so maybe the second's output is a single digit, so the third can process it as a string.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nInput -> first program -> output is a number (let's say A) -> second program takes A as input, outputs B (0 or 1) -> third program takes B as input (as a string?), and outputs the result.\n\nWait, but in the third program, the input is a string, so the second program's output (which is a number, either 0 or 1) must be passed as a string. So the second program's output is a single digit, which the third program reads as a string. So the third program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine all three into a single Fortran program. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nRead n and array arr. Then for all i and j (i <= j), create a copy of arr, flip bits between i and j, count the 1s, track the maximum. Then output max (or 0/1 if n=1).\n\nSecond program: takes x (the first's output), returns 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nThird program: takes a string (the second's output, which is \"0\" or \"1\"), processes it as a number string, and calculates some bills based on digits.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nIt reads a string, then converts each character to digits in reverse order (since it's stored in digits array from the end). Then processes each digit to compute bills. The output is the total bills.\n\nSo the third program's input is a string, which is the output of the second program. Since the second program outputs either 0 or 1, the third program's input is \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and array elements).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the first output (A).\n\n3. Process the second program's logic on A to get B (0 or 1).\n\n4. Process the third program's logic on B (as a string) to get the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst program steps:\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array.\n\nLoop over all possible i and j (i from 0 to n-1, j from i to n-1). For each such i,j:\n\n- Create a copy of the array.\n\n- Flip the bits (0 to 1, 1 to 0) between indices i and j (inclusive).\n\n- Count the number of 1s in the modified array.\n\n- Keep track of the maximum count.\n\nThen, if n is 1, output 0 if the element is 1, else 1. Else, output the max.\n\nWait, in Java, arrays are 0-based. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with any lower bound. To avoid confusion, perhaps use 1-based indices here.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays, but adjust loops accordingly.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the first step is to read n and the array.\n\nThen, for all i from 1 to n, and j from i to n:\n\n- Make a copy of the array.\n\n- Flip elements from i to j.\n\n- Count the 1s.\n\n- Update max.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop variables are i and j starting from 0. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the loops would be from 1 to n, and j from i to n.\n\nSo the first part's logic can be translated.\n\nNow, the second program is straightforward: take the first's output (A), then B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nThird program: takes the B (0 or 1) as a string input. Let's see:\n\nThe third program's input is a string, which is the output of the second program. Since the second program outputs either 0 or 1, the input to the third is \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nThe third program processes this string as a number, but in reverse order. Let's see:\n\nIn the third Java program:\n\nnumber is the input string. digits array is of length number.length() +1. Then, for each i from 0 to number.length-1, digits[i] is the digit at position (number.length -1 -i) - '0', so that's the reverse of the string's digits. For example, if the input is \"123\", then digits[0] is 3, digits[1] is 2, digits[2] is 1, and digits[3] is 0 (since the array is length+1, so 3+1=4 elements? Wait, original code:\n\ndigits is initialized as new int[number.length() +1]. So for a string of length L, digits has L+1 elements. The loop runs for i from 0 to L-1, and for each i, digits[i] is the digit from the end of the string. The digits[L] is initialized as 0 (since it's part of the array but not set in the loop). Wait, no, the loop only runs up to i < number.length(), so digits[L] is 0 initially? Or maybe the code is adding a carry?\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n}\n\ndigits[L] (where L is the length) is not set here. So it's initialized to 0 (since Java initializes int arrays to 0). Then, in the next loop, when processing digits[i], for i up to L (since the loop is for i from 0 to L), so digits[L] can be modified.\n\nThe processing loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n    if (digits[i] == 10) { ... } // Wait, digits[i] is set to number's digits, which are 0-9. So how can digits[i] be 10?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, in the code, the digits array is initialized with the digits of the input number, but in the processing loop, there's a line:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10) { ... }\n\nWait, that can't happen because digits[i] comes from the input digits (0-9). So perhaps that's a typo in the code? Or maybe in the code, there's a carry that can set digits[i] to 10?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, in the processing loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n        digits[i] = 0;\n    }\n    // ... other conditions\n}\n\nAh, so the code is handling carries. The digits[i] can be 10 after some operations. Wait, but how does that happen?\n\nWait, the code first reads the digits in reverse, then processes each digit. The first step in the loop is to check if the current digit is 10. But initially, digits[i] is between 0-9. So perhaps the code is adding a carry from the previous digit?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed to handle the case where digits[i] can be more than 10? Let me think through the code.\n\nWait, the code's processing loop is:\n\nfor each digit from 0 to L (the length of the original number):\n\nFirst, check if the current digit is 10. If so, carry over to the next digit.\n\nWait, but how does digits[i] become 10? Maybe in the code's processing, when adding a carry from the previous digit?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed to handle the case where digits[i] can be 10 after some operations. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in the first iteration, digits[i] is 10, then it adds 1 to digits[i+1], and sets digits[i] to 0. But how does digits[i] get to 10 in the first place?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but since it's given, I have to translate it as is. Maybe the code is supposed to handle carries when digits[i] exceeds 9. For example, when adding a carry from the previous digit, but perhaps the code has a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the 10 comes from some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written to handle the case where digits[i] can be 10 when processing the 'else' part (digits[i] >5). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the code's processing steps:\n\nThe code first checks if digits[i] is 10. If so, carry over.\n\nThen, if digits[i] <5: add to bills.\n\nElse if digits[i] ==5: check next digit and add 5, then carry if needed.\n\nElse (digits[i] >5): add 10 - digits[i], and carry over 1.\n\nWait, but in the case where digits[i] is 6, then 10-6=4 is added, and digits[i+1] is incremented by 1. So the next digit will have an extra 1, which may cause it to be 10 in the next iteration.\n\nAh, so the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is to handle the carry from the previous digit's processing. So the code is designed to process each digit, and if a digit is 10 (due to a carry from the previous step), then it's split into a carry to the next digit.\n\nWait, but the code's first step is to check for digits[i] ==10, which would be the case if the previous digit's processing added a carry. So the code is processing each digit in order, handling any carry from the previous step.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is:\n\nLoop over each digit (starting from the least significant digit, since the digits array is reversed):\n\n- If the current digit is 10 (due to a carry from the previous digit?), then carry over to the next digit.\n\nWait, but the first iteration (i=0) would have digits[0] as the first digit (the original last digit of the input string). So the code is processing digits from the least significant to the most, adding carries as needed.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky, but I need to translate this into Fortran.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and array elements).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (A).\n\n3. Compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\n4. Compute the third program's output using B as input (as a string).\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string. So B is either 0 or 1, so the input to the third program is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after computing B, we need to pass it as a string to the third part's processing.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran program.\n\nThe program will have variables for each step's data.\n\nFirst, read n and the array.\n\nThen compute A (the first program's output).\n\nThen compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nThen, process B as a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") through the third program's logic.\n\nNow, let's think about each part's implementation.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_327_A):\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: n, arr(n), max_val, current_count, i, j, k, x, temp_arr(n)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed sizes. Since n is read first, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, k, max_val, current_count, B, result\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), temp_arr(:)\ncharacter(len=1) :: B_str\n\n!

The final bills is the result\nresult = bills\n\n! Output the result\nprint*, result\n\ndeallocate(arr, digits)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but there are some issues here. Let me check step by step.\n\nFirst, in the first part, when n is not 1, the code loops over all i and j. The temp array is copied from arr, then flipped between i and j. Then count the 1s. The max_val is tracked. Then A is set to max_val.\n\nWait, in the original code, when n is 1, the output is 0 if arr[0] is 1, else 1. So in Fortran, if n is 1, then arr(1) is the element. So that part is correct.\n\nSecond part: B is set correctly.\n\nThird part: the input is B_str, which is the character '0' or '1'.\n\nProcessing the third part:\n\nThe original code in Java reads the input as a string, then reverses the digits. For example, if the input is \"123\", the digits array (Java) would be [3,2,1,0]. Wait, in Java, the code loops over i from 0 to number.length()-1, and for each i, takes the character at position (number.length() -1 -i). So for \"123\", the first character is at index 2 (since length is 3, so 3-1 -0 =2?), so the first character is '3', then next is '2', then '1'. So the digits array (Java) for \"123\" would be [3,2,1,0], with the last element (digits[3]?) being 0? Wait, the digits array in Java is of length number.length() +1. So for \"123\", length is 3, so digits has 4 elements. The loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since number.length() is 3, so i <3). So digits[0] =3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, digits[3] remains 0 (since it's initialized to 0).\n\nIn the Fortran code, the input is B_str, which is a single character (since B is 0 or 1). So len_trim(B_str) is 1. So the digits array is allocated as (1+1)=2 elements. The loop for i=1 to 1 (since len is 1):\n\ndigits(1) = B_str(1:1) - '0' (correct). digits(2) is 0.\n\nThen, the processing loop runs from i=1 to 2 (since len+1 is 2).\n\nWait, in the original code's loop, it's for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++), which in Java is 0 to 3 (for length 3). So in Fortran, the loop is from i=1 to len+1 (since len is the length of the input string). So for B_str being \"0\", len is 1, so loop runs i=1 to 2.\n\nNow, let's see the processing steps for the third part.\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\nCheck if digits(1) is 10? Initially, digits(1) is 0 or 1 (since B is 0 or 1). So no.\n\nThen, process the digit:\n\nIf digits(1) <5: add to bills. So for B=0, digits(1)=0 \u2192 bills +=0.\n\nElse if 5 \u2192 add 5, but B can't be 5 here.\n\nElse (digits(1) >5 \u2192 only possible if B is 1? No, 1 is less than 5. So for B=1, digits(1)=1 \u2192 <5 \u2192 add 1.\n\nThen, proceed to next i=2.\n\nSecond iteration (i=2):\n\ndigits(2) is 0 (initially). So check if it's 10 \u2192 no.\n\ndigits(2) is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills.\n\nThen, check if it's 5 \u2192 no. So bills remains same.\n\nWait, but in the original code's processing loop, after the first part (checking for 10), the code processes the digit's contribution to bills.\n\nWait, in the code's processing loop:\n\nFirst, check if the digit is 10 (carry), then process the digit's contribution.\n\nWait, in the code's logic, the first step is to handle the carry (digits[i] =10), then process the current digit's contribution to bills.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code above, the code first checks if digits(i) is 10, then does the carry, then proceeds to the bill calculation. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code's processing loop, the order is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 carry.\n\nthen, process the digit's contribution (digits[i] is now possibly modified? Or not?)\n\nWait, in the code's first step, if digits[i] is 10, then it's set to 0 and the next digit is incremented. So after that, the digit is 0, so the next steps (bill calculation) would use the modified digit?\n\nWait, in the code's first step, after handling the 10 case, the digit is now 0, so the next steps (bill calculation) would use the new value.\n\nWait, the code's first step is to check if the current digit is 10 (due to a carry from previous step?), then carry over. So after that, the digit is 0, so the next steps (bill calculation) would use the 0.\n\nWait, but in the code's processing loop, the bill calculation is done after handling the 10 case. So the code's logic is:\n\nfor each digit:\n\n- if it's 10, carry over (so becomes 0, next digit +1)\n\n- then, process the current digit (now possibly 0) to add to bills.\n\nWait, but in the code's first step, the digit is set to 0, so the bill calculation would use the 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that the carry is handled first, then the current digit (after carry) is used for the bill.\n\nWait, the code's first step is to handle the carry (digits[i] =10 \u2192 set to 0 and carry to next digit). Then, the code proceeds to compute the bill based on the current digit (now 0).\n\nWait, but in the code's first step, the digit is set to 0, so the bill calculation would use that.\n\nWait, but in the code's first step, the digit was 10, so after processing, it's 0, so the bill contribution would be 0 (if <5). But the carry was from a previous digit's processing.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct, but I need to translate it as is.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the processing loop is:\n\ndo i=1, len+1\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        digits(i) =0\n    end if\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n        if (i < len+1) then\n            if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n            end if\n        end if\n        bills = bills +5\n    else\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the else clause (digits(i) >5), after adding 10 - digits(i), we also increment digits(i+1). But in the case where i is the last element (i = len+1), then digits(i+1) would be out of bounds. Because digits has len+1 elements, so the maximum index is len+1. So when i = len+1, i+1 is len+2, which is beyond the array. So in that case, we can't increment digits(i+1). So need to handle that.\n\nWait, in the original code's loop, the loop runs up to i <= number.length(). The digits array has length+1 elements, so the last i is number.length() (Java's 0-based), which is len in Fortran (since len is the length of the input string). Wait, perhaps in Fortran, the loop should run up to i = len+1, but when i is len+1, then i+1 would be len+2, which is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an out-of-bounds error.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original code's processing loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    ... other conditions\n\n}\n\ndigits has length number.length() +1. So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()] in Java, which is the (len+1)th element in Fortran's 1-based array). So when i is number.length(), then i+1 would be number.length()+1, which is beyond the array (since digits has length number.length()+1, so indices 0 to number.length() in Java, which is 1 to len+1 in Fortran).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the digits array is 1-based with size len+1. So the maximum i is len+1. So when i is len+1, then i+1 is len+2, which is beyond the array. So in that case, when i is the last element (i = len+1), the code's line digits(i+1) = ... would be out of bounds.\n\nTherefore, in the code's processing loop, when i is the last element (i = len+1), the code should not attempt to increment digits(i+1). So in the code's else clause (digits[i] >5), when i is the last element, we can't do digits(i+1) +=1.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, when processing i from 1 to len+1:\n\nIn the else clause (digits(i) >5):\n\nif (i < len+1) then\n\n    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\nelse\n\n    ! can't do anything, so just add to bills?\n\nWait, but the original code's processing loop in Java would have digits[i] (for i = number.length()) which is the last element. So in that case, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array (since digits has length number.length()+1, so indices 0 to number.length() in Java). So in Java, when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1, which is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an array out of bounds error. Wait, but the original code's loop is up to i <= number.length(), so when i is number.length(), then digits[i] is digits[number.length()], which is the last element. The code's line digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. So that's a bug in the original code?\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code has a bug here. But since the problem says to translate the code as is, I have to replicate that behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct because when i is the last element (number.length()), the digits[i] can't be greater than 9, so the else clause (digits[i] >5) would not trigger a need to increment digits[i+1], but that's not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed so that when processing the last digit, any carry is handled by adding a new digit. But since the array is of size len+1, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nWait, in the original code's digits array, the last element (digits[number.length()]) is initialized to 0. So when processing the last digit (i = number.length()), if digits[i] is 10 (due to a carry from previous digits), then it would set digits[i] to 0 and increment digits[i+1], which is beyond the array. So that's a bug.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps I should proceed as per the code's logic, even if it has a bug. But in the given Java code, perhaps the loop is written correctly.\n\nWait, in the original code's loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    ... other conditions\n\n}\n\ndigits has length number.length() +1. So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()]). The next element would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. So the code is incorrect here. But perhaps the code is intended to have the loop up to i < number.length()+1, but written as <=.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct because when i is the last index, the digits[i] can't be 10? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit, any carry is added to the next digit (which is beyond the array), but since the loop stops there, it's okay. But in that case, the code would have an out-of-bounds error.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if there's a bug. So in Fortran, when i reaches len+1 (the last element), then digits(i+1) is out of bounds. To avoid that, perhaps in the code, when i is the last element (i = len+1), then we can't increment digits(i+1). So in the else clause (digits(i) >5), we can only do the increment if i < len+1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the digits array has indices 1 to len+1. So the last element is len+1. So when i is len+1, then i+1 is len+2, which is beyond the array. So in that case, when processing the else clause (digits(i) >5), we can't do the increment. So in the code, we need to check if i < len+1 before incrementing.\n\nWait, in the else clause (digits(i) >5):\n\nbills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\nif (i < len+1) then\n\n    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as:\n\ndigits[i + 1]++;\n\nSo in the code, it's done unconditionally. So in Fortran, to replicate that, even if it's out of bounds, but since we can't do that, perhaps the code is intended to have the array size sufficient. But given that the original code may have a bug, but we have to translate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can't be greater than 9, so the else clause (digits[i] >5) would not trigger the increment. But that's not necessarily true.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a problem, but perhaps proceed with the code as written, and in Fortran, when i is the last element (i = len+1), the code will have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can be 10 (due to a carry from previous digits). For example, if the previous digit had a carry, then digits[i] could be 10, so the first condition (digits[i] ==10) would trigger, setting digits[i] to 0 and incrementing digits[i+1], which is beyond the array. So that's a bug.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is intended to have the loop up to i < number.length() +1, but written as <=. So in Fortran, the loop should be from i=1 to len+1, but when i is len+1, the digits[i+1] is out of bounds. To avoid that, perhaps the loop should be up to i = len, but that's not matching the original code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so the last element is digits[len+1], and the loop runs up to i = len+1 (in Fortran terms). So when i is len+1, the digits[i] can be processed, but the digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed with the code as written, and in Fortran, when i is the last element, the code will have an error. But since the problem says to translate the code, perhaps the code is correct in the original context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit (i = len+1 in Fortran), the digits[i] can't be 10 or greater than 5. But I'm not sure.\n\nWell, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code as written, and in the Fortran code, handle the case where i is the last element by not incrementing digits(i+1) when it's out of bounds.\n\nWait, in the else clause (digits(i) >5):\n\nbills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\nif (i < len+1) then\n\n    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\nend if\n\nThis way, when i is the last element (len+1), the increment is skipped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's loop is up to i < number.length() +1, so in Fortran, the loop is up to i = len+1, but the digits array has len+1 elements, so the maximum i is len+1. So when i is len+1, digits[i] is the last element, and digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so the last element is digits[len+1], and the loop runs up to i = len+1. So when i is len+1, the code can process digits[i], but the digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed with the code as written, and in Fortran, when i is the last element, the code will have an error. But since the problem says to translate the code, perhaps the code is correct in the original context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is of length len+1, so the last element is digits[len+1], and the loop runs up to i = len+1. So when i is len+1, the code can process digits[i], but the digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So in that case, the code would have an error. But since the problem requires translating the code as given, perhaps proceed.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a problem, but I'll proceed with the code as written, and in the Fortran code, when i is the last element, the code will have an error. But perhaps in the given problem's test cases, this situation doesn't occur. For example, if the input to the third program is \"0\" or \"1\", then the digits array is of length 2 (since len is 1). So the loop runs i from 1 to 2.\n\nFor i=2 (the second element):\n\ndigits(2) is initially 0.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst, check if digits(2) is 10 \u2192 no.\n\nThen, check if it's <5 \u2192 yes (0). So add 0 to bills.\n\nNo other conditions.\n\nThen, the else clause is not triggered.\n\nSo in this case, the code is okay.\n\nAnother example: if the input is \"5\".\n\nThen len is 1, digits array is size 2.\n\ndigits(1) =5, digits(2)=0.\n\nProcessing i=1:\n\nCheck if 5 ==10 \u2192 no.\n\nThen, digits(1) ==5 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if i < len+1 (1 < 2 \u2192 yes). Then check if digits(2) >=5 \u2192 0 is not, so no change.\n\nAdd 5 to bills (bills=5).\n\nThen, i=2:\n\ndigits(2) is 0 \u2192 add 0.\n\nSo total bills is 5.\n\nWhich matches the code's logic.\n\nAnother example: input \"6\".\n\ndigits(1)=6, digits(2)=0.\n\nProcessing i=1:\n\ndigits(1) >5 \u2192 yes.\n\nbills += 10-6=4 \u2192 bills=4.\n\ndigits(2) +=1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThen i=2:\n\ndigits(2)=1 \u2192 <5 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 5.\n\nSo total bills is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: input \"9\".\n\ndigits(1)=9 \u2192 >5 \u2192 bills +=1 (10-9=1), digits(2) becomes 1.\n\nThen i=2: digits(2)=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nSo total bills 2.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nAnother case: input \"10\".\n\nWait, but the second program's output is either 0 or 1, so the third program's input can't be \"10\". So the third program's input is always a single digit. So the code's processing for single-digit inputs is okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should work for the given problem's constraints.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should be as follows.\n\nWait, also, in the first part, when n is not 1, the max_val is initialized to -huge(max_val). But in Fortran, the initial max_val should be set to the minimum possible integer. The function huge() returns the largest integer, so -huge(max_val) is the smallest possible integer.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, when n is not 1, after the loops, A is set to max_val. But what if all the subarrays give a count less than the initial max_val (which is -huge)? But since the array has at least two elements, the maximum count can't be negative. So the first iteration will set max_val to at least 0.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, the code for the third part:\n\nThe code for the third part in Fortran:\n\nAfter converting B to a string (B_str), which is either '0' or '1', the code proceeds to process it.\n\nThe digits array is initialized with the reversed digits? Wait, no. Wait, in the original code, the digits array is filled in reverse order of the input string. For example, input \"123\" becomes digits[0]=3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, digits[3]=0.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the input is B_str, which is a single character. So the digits array is of length 2 (since len is 1). The first element (digits(1)) is the first character of B_str (since the loop is for i=1 to len (1), so digits(1) = B_str(1:1) - '0'. The second element (digits(2)) is initialized to 0.\n\nSo the digits array is [B, 0].\n\nThen, processing the digits in order (i from 1 to 2).\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran program should look like this:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, k, max_val, current_count, B, result\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), temp_arr(:)\ncharacter(len=1) :: B_str\n\n!

Second program's logic\nif (A ==1) then\n    B =0\nelse\n    B =1\nend if\n\n! Convert B to character string\nB_str = char(B + ichar('0'))\n\n! Process third program's logic\ninteger :: len = len_trim(B_str)\ninteger, allocatable :: digits(:)\ninteger :: bills =0, i_digit\n\nallocate(digits(len +1))\ndigits =0\n\n! Fill digits array with reversed digits? Wait no, in the original code, the digits are filled in reverse order of the input string.\n\n! Wait, in the original code, the digits array is filled as follows:\n\n! for each i from 0 to len-1 (Java's loop):\n\n! digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0'\n\n! which is the reverse of the input string.\n\n! So in Fortran, the input string is B_str, which is length 1. So the first character is the first (and only) character.\n\n! So for B_str = '0', the digits array (length 2) would be digits(1)=0, digits(2)=0.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe original code's loop for filling digits:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo for a string \"123\", the first character (i=0) is the last character of the string (3), then next is 2, then 1.\n\nIn Fortran, the input is B_str, which is a single character. So the loop runs for i=1 to len (1):\n\ndigits(1) = B_str(1:1) - '0'\n\ndigits(2) remains 0.\n\nSo the digits array is [B, 0].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, processing the digits array:\n\ndo i=1, len+1\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        digits(i) =0\n    end if\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n        if (i < len+1) then\n            if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n            end if\n        end if\n        bills = bills +5\n    else\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n        if (i < len+1) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, in the else clause (digits(i) >5), the increment of digits(i+1) is only done if i < len+1.\n\nThis handles the case where i is the last element (len+1), so i+1 is out of bounds.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nFinally, output the bills.\n\nNow, putting all together, the code should be:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, k, max_val, current_count, A, B, result\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), temp_arr(:)\ncharacter(len=1) :: B_str\n\n!

Output the result\nprint*, bills\n\ndeallocate(arr, digits)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the first part, the temp_arr is declared as an allocatable array? Or is it a local array?\n\nIn the first part's code, when n is not 1, the code has:\n\ntemp_arr = arr\n\nBut in Fortran, if temp_arr is not allocated, this would cause an error. So temp_arr must be allocated.\n\nAh, right! I forgot to allocate temp_arr. That's a mistake.\n\nSo in the first part, when n is not 1, we need to allocate temp_arr with size n.\n\nSo inside the else block (when n is not 1):\n\nallocate(temp_arr(n))\n\nThen, after the loops, deallocate it.\n\nWait, but in the loops, temp_arr is used in each iteration of i and j. So it's better to allocate it once before the loops.\n\nSo modifying the first part:\n\nelse\n    allocate(temp_arr(n))\n    max_val = -huge(max_val)\n    do i=1, n\n        do j=i, n\n            temp_arr = arr\n            do k =i, j\n                if (temp_arr(k) ==0) then\n                    temp_arr(k) =1\n                else\n                    temp_arr(k) =0\n                end if\n            end do\n            current_count = count(temp_arr ==1)\n            if (current_count > max_val) then\n                max_val = current_count\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n    deallocate(temp_arr)\n    A = max_val\nend if\n\nThis way, temp_arr is allocated once before the loops and deallocated after.\n\nThis is important to avoid memory issues.\n\nSo the corrected code would have that.\n\nAlso, in the first part, after the loops, deallocate temp_arr.\n\nNow, the final code should look like this."
