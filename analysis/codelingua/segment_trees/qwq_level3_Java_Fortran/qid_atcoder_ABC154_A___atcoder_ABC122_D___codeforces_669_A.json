So maybe the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. But in the original setup, the second program's input is the first program's output. So the second program's input is the two numbers, but it only reads the first as N. That would make sense. So the second program's N is the first number from the first program's output. The second number is ignored. Then the third program takes the output of the second (a single number) and processes it. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is two numbers, say X Y.",

Alternatively, using:\n\ntemp_char = s_swapped(i:i)\ns_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\ns_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp_char\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables must be of the same type.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC154_A) reads three lines of input. The first line is split into a string array, the second line gives two integers a and b, and the third line is a string u. It checks if u equals the first part of the first line. If so, it outputs a-1 and b; else, a and b-1. So the output here is two integers separated by a space.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC122_D) is more complex. It reads an integer N and calculates some value using a recursive DP approach with memoization. The problem seems to count the number of valid strings of length N avoiding certain substrings, modulo 1e9+7. The main function initializes the class and calls calc(), which returns the result.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n and outputs a value based on dividing by 3. The formula is (n//3)*2 plus 1 if n mod 3 isn't zero, else 0. So for example, n=4 would be (1)*2 +1 =3.\n\nNow, the key is to chain these three programs. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in the middle steps. So the first program's output (the two integers) must be passed as input to the second's processing, but since the second's input is N (from the second Java file's main), that's a problem. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the second Java program's main reads N from input. But in the original sequence, the first program's output is two integers, which would be the input for the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a single integer N. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is two integers. The second program expects to read an integer N. So the first program's output must be the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a single integer. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is \"a-1 b\" or \"a b-1\", which is two integers separated by space. The second program's input is N, which is read via in.nextInt(). So the second program expects a single integer as input. Therefore, the first program's output (two numbers) can't be the input to the second program. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. The user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program's input is N, which is a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer? But the first program outputs two numbers. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code.\n\nLooking back at the first Java program:\n\nThe first line is split into a string array (probably two elements?), then the second line is split into a and b. The third line is u. The output is either (a-1, b) or (a, b-1). So the output is two integers. But the second program expects N as input, which is a single integer. So this can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program's input. But the second program's input is N, which is a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But according to the code, it's two numbers. That's a problem. Maybe I misread the first program's code.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program again:\n\nThe first line is read as a string array from splitting on space. Then the second line is read via StringTokenizer, getting a and b. The third line is u. The output is either (a-1) + \" \" + b or a + \" \" + (b-1). So the output is two numbers. So the second program must read those two numbers as its input. But the second program's code reads N via in.nextInt(). So the second program is expecting a single integer N. Therefore, the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program is expecting one. That's a problem. Unless the second program's input is the first number of the first program's output. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, and the second program takes the first of them as N. But the second program's code is expecting N to be the input. So maybe the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. But in the original setup, the second program's input is the first program's output. So the second program's input is the two numbers, but it only reads the first as N. That would make sense. So the second program's N is the first number from the first program's output. The second number is ignored. Then the third program takes the output of the second (a single number) and processes it.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is two numbers, say X Y. The second program reads X as N. The second program's output is a number Z. The third program reads Z as n and outputs the result.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, I need to:\n\n1. Read the inputs for the first program (the three lines: first line, second line with a and b, third line u).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (X Y).\n\n3. Use X as the input to the second program's N.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result Z.\n\n5. Use Z as the input to the third program's n.\n\n6. Output the third program's result.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program must do all these steps in sequence, without I/O except first read and last write.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nRead first line: probably two strings (split on space). Let's see, in the first Java code, the first line is split into a string array, but then the second line is read via StringTokenizer. Wait, the first line is read as in.readLine().split(\" \"), so that's the first line's content split into parts. But then the second line is read via StringTokenizer. Wait, the code is:\n\nString[] str = in.readLine().split(\" \");\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\na = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nb = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nu = in.readLine();\n\nWait, the first line is split into str (probably two elements?), then the second line is read as a line, split into tokens (so two integers a and b). The third line is u.\n\nThe output is either (a-1, b) or (a, b-1) depending on whether u equals str[0].\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the first line, split into two strings (assuming it's two words), then read the second line as two integers a and b, then read the third line as a string u.\n\nThen compute X and Y as per the condition.\n\nSecond program's logic: given N (the first number from first program's output), compute the count using the DP approach with memoization. The problem is to compute the number of valid strings of length N, avoiding certain substrings, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe third program takes the result of the second (Z) and computes (Z//3)*2 + (1 if Z mod 3 !=0 else 0).\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nRead first line: let's say first_line is a string. Split into two parts, str1 and str2. In Fortran, splitting strings can be done with index and substring functions. Alternatively, read the first line as a string, then split into two tokens.\n\nThen read the second line as two integers a and b.\n\nRead third line as u.\n\nThen check if u == str1. If yes, X = a-1, Y = b. Else, X = a, Y = b-1.\n\nSecond part (second Java program):\n\nThe second program's N is X (the first number from first program's output). The second program's output is the result of the DP calculation.\n\nThe DP is a memoization approach. The problem is to count the number of strings of length N using the four characters A, C, G, T, such that no four consecutive characters contain \"AGC\" or any permutation that can form \"AGC\" when swapping adjacent characters. The DP state is current length and the last three characters. The memoization is done with a map for each current length and last three characters.\n\nIn Fortran, implementing memoization with a hash map is tricky because Fortran doesn't have built-in hash tables. So I need to find a way to represent the state (last three characters) as an integer or some index, so that we can use an array for memoization.\n\nThe possible last three characters are combinations of the four letters (A, C, G, T). There are 4^3 = 64 possible states. So for each current length (from 0 to N), and each of the 64 possible last three characters, we can store the count.\n\nThus, the memo can be a 2D array: memo(current_length, state) = count mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe state can be represented as an integer from 0 to 63, where each character is mapped to a number (e.g., A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). The three characters form a 3-digit number in base 4, so the state is (c1 * 16) + (c2 *4) + c3.\n\nWait, for example, the first character is the first digit (most significant), so for \"TTT\", the state would be (3)*16 + (3)*4 +3 = 3*21 + 3? Wait, 3^3? Wait, 4^3 is 64. So each of the three characters can be 0-3, so the total is 4^3=64. So the state can be represented as (first_char)*16 + (second_char)*4 + third_char.\n\nThus, the state can be an integer from 0 to 63.\n\nSo the memo array can be a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64. Since N can be up to... Well, the original problem's constraints for ABC122_D probably have N up to 1e5 or something, but in the problem's context, maybe N is up to 1e5. However, in Fortran, arrays can be large, but need to check.\n\nWait, the original problem's constraints for ABC122_D: looking at the problem statement (since I can't check, but the code uses N up to whatever the input is). The code uses memo as an array of maps, but in Fortran, using a 2D array for memo would be better.\n\nSo the steps for the second part:\n\nInitialize memo as a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64, initialized to -1 or some invalid value to indicate not computed.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which corresponds to current=0 and last3=\"TTT\". The state for \"TTT\" is (3,3,3) \u2192 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 3*(20) +3 \u2192 63? Wait 3*16 is 48, 3*4 is 12, plus 3 \u2192 total 63. So the initial state is 63.\n\nThe function dfs(current, state) returns the number of valid strings up to current length, ending with the given state.\n\nThe base case is when current == N, return 1.\n\nFor each possible next character (A, C, G, T), check if adding it to the last three characters (making a four-character string) is allowed.\n\nThe isOK function checks two conditions:\n\n1. The last four characters (previous three plus new character) do not contain \"AGC\".\n\n2. For each of the three possible adjacent swaps in the last four characters, the resulting string also doesn't contain \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the original code's isOK function:\n\nThe first check is if the last4 contains \"AGC\". If yes, return false.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2 (since last4 is 4 characters, indices 0-3?), the code swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, then checks if the new string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps result in \"AGC\", then it's invalid.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n    vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n    String s = new String(vals);\n    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code is taking the last4 string, and for each position i (0,1,2), it swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, then checks if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps result in a string with \"AGC\", then the original last4 is invalid.\n\nWait, the idea is that the original string must not have any substring that could become \"AGC\" with a single adjacent swap. Because the problem states that the string must not contain \"AGC\" as a substring, and also must not have any four-character substring that can be turned into \"AGC\" by swapping two adjacent characters. So the forbidden patterns are those that could form \"AGC\" through such swaps.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. So the isOK function is checking that the last four characters (the previous three plus the new character) do not contain \"AGC\", and also that any adjacent swap in the four characters doesn't create \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the entire string never has \"AGC\" as a substring, and also that no four consecutive characters can form \"AGC\" by swapping two adjacent characters. So the check is to ensure that the four-character string doesn't have \"AGC\" and that any of the three possible swaps (swapping first and second, second and third, third and fourth) in the four-character string would not create \"AGC\".\n\nTherefore, the isOK function is ensuring that the four-character string is \"safe\".\n\nSo in Fortran, to implement this, for a given last3 (the previous three characters) and the new character c, forming last4 = last3 + c, we need to check:\n\n1. Does last4 contain \"AGC\"?\n\n2. For each possible swap between adjacent characters in last4, does the resulting string contain \"AGC\"?\n\nIf any of these are true, then it's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be rephrased as:\n\nCheck all possible substrings of length 3 in the four-character string, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be implemented as follows:\n\nGiven the four-character string s (last3 + c), check:\n\n- s contains \"AGC\" \u2192 invalid.\n\n- For each possible swap of adjacent characters in s (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3), create a new string and check if it contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these are true, return false.\n\nSo in code, for the four-character string s:\n\nif s contains \"AGC\" \u2192 return false.\n\nthen for each i from 0 to 2:\n\nswap characters at i and i+1 \u2192 new string s2.\n\nif s2 contains \"AGC\" \u2192 return false.\n\nThus, the function returns true only if none of these conditions are met.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a given four-character string (represented as a 4-character array or a string), we can perform these checks.\n\nBut in the DP step, when considering adding a new character c to the last three characters (last3), forming a four-character string (last3 + c), we need to check if this four-character string is allowed.\n\nWait, the function isOK is called with last4 being the concatenation of the previous three characters and the new character. So in the code, the parameter is last3 (the previous three characters), and the new character is c. So the last4 is last3 + c.\n\nWait, in the code's dfs function:\n\nfor each c in TOKENS:\n\nif (isOK(last3 + c)) \u2192 then proceed.\n\nThus, the isOK function is checking the four-character string formed by last3 (three characters) plus the new character c.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each step, when considering adding a new character, we can form the four-character string, then check the conditions.\n\nNow, the problem is how to represent the last three characters and the new character in Fortran, and perform these checks.\n\nFirst, the state can be represented as an integer (as discussed earlier). The new character is one of the four options (A, C, G, T). So for each possible next character, we can compute the new state (the last three characters become the last two of the previous three plus the new character).\n\nWait, the new state after adding c would be the last three characters: the previous last two plus c. So for example, if the previous state was \"TTT\" (state 63), adding 'A' (0) would give the new state as (3,3,0) \u2192 3*16 +3*4 +0 = 48 +12 +0 =60.\n\nThus, the new state is ( (state // 4) *4 + new_char_code ), but wait, let's see:\n\nThe previous state is represented as (c1, c2, c3). The new state after adding c would be (c2, c3, c). So the new state's value is (c2)*16 + (c3)*4 + c.\n\nThe previous state's value is (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + c3. So to get the new state, we can take the previous state, shift right by one character (divided by 4), then multiply by 4 and add the new character's code.\n\nSo new_state = ( (prev_state) /4 ) *4 + new_char_code ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev_state = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3.\n\nDivided by 4: (c1*16 + c2*4 + c3)/4 = c1*4 + c2 + (c3)/4. Hmm, but since c3 is 0-3, the division would be integer division, so (prev_state /4) = c1*4 + c2.\n\nThen, (prev_state /4)*4 = c1*16 + c2*4.\n\nAdding new_char_code gives (c1*16 + c2*4) + new_char \u2192 which is (c1*4 + c2)*4 + new_char \u2192 which is (c2)*4 + c3 (no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here).\n\nAlternatively, the new state is (c2, c3, new_char). So the new_state is (c2)*16 + (c3)*4 + new_char.\n\nThe previous state was (c1, c2, c3) \u2192 prev_state = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3.\n\nSo to get the new_state, we can compute:\n\nnew_state = ( (prev_state mod 16) ) *4 + new_char ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev_state mod 16 gives (c2*4 + c3). Wait, no:\n\nWait, prev_state is c1*16 + (c2*4 + c3). So mod 16 gives (c2*4 + c3). Then multiplying by 4 gives (c2*4 + c3)*4 = c2*16 + c3*4. Then adding new_char gives c2*16 + c3*4 + new_char \u2192 which is exactly the new_state (c2, c3, new_char).\n\nYes, so new_state = ( (prev_state mod 16) ) *4 + new_char.\n\nThus, the new_state can be computed as ( (prev_state mod 16) *4 ) + new_char.\n\nSo in code, for each possible next character (A, C, G, T), which have codes 0,1,2,3 respectively, we can compute the new_state.\n\nNow, the isOK function needs to check the four-character string formed by the previous three characters (c1, c2, c3) plus the new character (c). To do this, we can reconstruct the four-character string from the previous state and the new character.\n\nThe previous state is (c1, c2, c3). The new character is c. So the four characters are c1, c2, c3, c.\n\nWe can represent each character as a character code (0-3), then map them back to the actual letters (A, C, G, T) to form the string for checking.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to check for the presence of \"AGC\" in the four-character string and in the swapped versions, perhaps we can do this without converting to actual letters, by checking the codes.\n\nLet me think: the forbidden substring \"AGC\" corresponds to the codes A=0, G=2, C=1. So the sequence 0,2,1.\n\nSo in the four-character string (c1, c2, c3, c), we need to check if any three consecutive characters form 0,2,1. Also, after swapping adjacent characters, check if any three in a row form 0,2,1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the four characters as an array and check for the presence of the forbidden substrings.\n\nLet me outline the steps for isOK:\n\nGiven the four characters (c1, c2, c3, c4):\n\nCheck if any of the following substrings exist:\n\n- \"AGC\" (0,2,1) in positions 0-2, 1-3.\n\nWait, the four characters can have three possible triplets:\n\npositions 0-2 (c1,c2,c3), 1-3 (c2,c3,c4). So check if either of those is 0,2,1.\n\nAlso, check the swapped versions.\n\nWait, the original code's isOK function first checks if the four-character string contains \"AGC\". So the four-character string can have \"AGC\" as a substring (i.e., in positions 0-2 or 1-3). If yes, return false.\n\nThen, for each possible swap between adjacent characters (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3), swap them and check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo in code:\n\nFirst, check the original four-character string for \"AGC\".\n\nThen, for each swap position (0,1,2):\n\n- create a copy of the four characters.\n\n- swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters.\n\n- check if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these are true, return false.\n\nThus, in Fortran, for each four-character string (represented as an array of four integers 0-3), we can perform these checks.\n\nAlternatively, since the four characters are represented as codes, perhaps we can do this without converting to strings.\n\nLet me think of the four characters as an array of four integers (c1, c2, c3, c4).\n\nFirst check:\n\nCheck if any of the first three characters (c1,c2,c3) form 0,2,1 \u2192 (c1 ==0 and c2 ==2 and c3 ==1) \u2192 then return false.\n\nOr the next triplet (c2,c3,c4) \u2192 (c2 ==0 and c3 ==2 and c4 ==1) \u2192 return false.\n\nIf either is true, return false.\n\nThen, for each swap position i (0,1,2):\n\n- create a temporary array where the i-th and (i+1)-th elements are swapped.\n\n- check the first three elements of the temp array (positions 0-2) and the next triplet (positions 1-3) for the forbidden sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to code this in Fortran by first converting the four-character codes into a string, then checking for the presence of \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, since the codes are 0-3, we can map them to characters:\n\ncode 0 \u2192 'A'\n\n1 \u2192 'C'\n\n2 \u2192 'G'\n\n3 \u2192 'T'\n\nThus, the four-character string can be built as a string of length 4, then check for \"AGC\" in it.\n\nSimilarly, after swapping, check the new string.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a given four-character array (c1,c2,c3,c4):\n\nConstruct the string s as:\n\ns(1:1) = char(65 + code_to_char(c1)) \u2192 Wait, code 0 is 'A' (ASCII 65), code 1 is 'C' (67?), code 2 is 'G' (71?), code 3 is 'T' (84). Wait, perhaps better to have a lookup array:\n\nchar_map(0) = 'A'\n\nchar_map(1) = 'C'\n\nchar_map(2) = 'G'\n\nchar_map(3) = 'T'\n\nThus, for each code, we can get the corresponding character.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: four_chars = [c1, c2, c3, c4]\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: s\n\ns = char_map(four_chars(1)) // char_map(four_chars(2)) // char_map(four_chars(3)) // char_map(four_chars(4))\n\nThen check if s contains 'AGC'.\n\nTo check if a substring exists, in Fortran, we can use the index function. For example, if index(s, 'AGC') >0 \u2192 contains.\n\nThen, for each swap:\n\ndo i = 1,3 (since positions 0-based in the array are 0-3, but in Fortran arrays start at 1?)\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless specified. So perhaps better to use 1-based indices.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of code:\n\nSuppose the four characters are stored in an array of 4 elements (indices 1-4).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 3 (since swapping positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4):\n\ncreate a temporary array temp = four_chars\n\nswap temp(i) and temp(i+1)\n\nconstruct the string from temp and check if it contains 'AGC'.\n\nIf any of these swaps result in a string containing 'AGC', then return .false.\n\nThus, the isOK function can be implemented in Fortran with these steps.\n\nNow, the DP part:\n\nThe memo array is a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64 (since the state can be 0-63). The value stored is the number of ways modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, initial_state). The initial_state is \"TTT\", which corresponds to codes (3,3,3) \u2192 state = 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63.\n\nThe base case is when current == N \u2192 return 1.\n\nThe recursive function can be implemented with memoization using the array.\n\nBut in Fortran, recursion can be tricky for large N. The original Java code uses memoization with a map, but in Fortran, with an array, it's manageable.\n\nHowever, for large N (like up to 1e5?), the recursion depth might be a problem. Wait, the original problem's constraints for ABC122_D probably have N up to 1e5? But in the code, the memo is stored as an array of maps, which can handle that. But in Fortran, using a 2D array for memo would be better, but for N=1e5, the array size would be 1e5 *64, which is 6.4e6 elements. That's manageable in Fortran, but the recursion depth would be N, which for N=1e5 would cause a stack overflow.\n\nThus, recursion is not feasible here. So we need to implement the DP iteratively.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. The original Java code uses memoization with recursion, but in Fortran, for large N, recursion would hit stack limits. So better to implement the DP iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints for N are small. Let me check the problem's constraints for ABC122_D (since I can't look it up, but the code uses N as input, and the memo is stored as an array of maps. The code's approach is O(N * 4^3) which is acceptable for N up to say 1e5? 1e5 * 64 is 6.4e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut recursion depth would be N, so for N=1e5, that's a problem. So better to implement the DP iteratively.\n\nThus, the plan is to implement the DP with an iterative approach using the memo array.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nInitialize memo as a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64, initialized to 0.\n\nSet memo(0, initial_state) = 1.\n\nThen, for each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   for each state in 0 to 63:\n\n      if memo(current, state) >0:\n\n          for each possible next_char (0-3):\n\n              compute the four_char array (the previous three chars of state plus next_char)\n\n              check if isOK(four_char)\n\n              if yes:\n\n                  new_state = ( (state mod 16)*4 + next_char )\n\n                  memo(current+1, new_state) = (memo(current+1, new_state) + memo(current, state)) mod MOD\n\nFinally, the result is the sum over all states of memo(N, state).\n\nWait, but the initial call in the Java code is dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which corresponds to current=0 and state=63. So the initial memo(0,63) =1.\n\nThen, for each step, we process each state and possible next characters.\n\nThus, the iterative approach would be:\n\nInitialize all memo entries to 0.\n\nmemo(0, 63) =1.\n\nThen for current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   do for each state in 0 to 63:\n\n      if memo(current, state) ==0 \u2192 skip.\n\n      else:\n\n          get the previous three characters from the state.\n\n          for each next_char in 0,1,2,3:\n\n              construct the four_char array (prev three + next_char)\n\n              check if isOK(four_char)\n\n              if yes:\n\n                  compute new_state as ( (state mod 16)*4 + next_char )\n\n                  memo(current+1, new_state) = (memo(current+1, new_state) + memo(current, state)) mod MOD\n\nFinally, the result is the sum over all states of memo(N, state).\n\nWait, but in the original code, the base case is when current == N \u2192 returns 1. So the total is the sum of all paths that reach current=N, which is exactly the sum of memo(N, all states).\n\nThus, the iterative approach is feasible.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nThird part (third Java program):\n\nThe third program takes the result Z from the second program and computes (Z//3)*2 + (1 if Z mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, this is straightforward: compute (Z /3)*2 + (merge(1,0, mod(Z,3)/=0)).\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the first three lines as per the first Java program.\n\n2. Compute X and Y.\n\n3. Take X as N for the second program.\n\n4. Compute the DP result Z.\n\n5. Compute the third program's output based on Z.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read the first line:\n\nRead the first line as a string. Split into two parts. In Fortran, this can be done with a read statement with a format that reads two strings.\n\nBut Fortran's read can be tricky. Alternatively, read the entire line into a character variable, then split it.\n\nSuppose the first line is read into a character variable line1 of sufficient length (say 1000).\n\nThen, split into two strings str1 and str2.\n\nSimilarly, the second line is read as two integers a and b.\n\nThird line is read as u.\n\nThen, check if u == str1. If yes, X = a-1, Y = b. Else, X =a, Y =b-1.\n\nThen, proceed to compute the second part with N = X.\n\nNow, the second part's computation:\n\nWe need to compute the DP result Z.\n\nImplementing the iterative DP:\n\nFirst, define the MOD as 1000000007.\n\nThe state is represented as an integer from 0 to 63.\n\nThe four characters for checking isOK can be derived from the state and next_char.\n\nThe isOK function can be a function that takes the four characters (as an array of 4 integers) and returns a logical.\n\nImplementing the isOK function:\n\nFUNCTION isOK(four_chars) RESULT(ok)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: four_chars(4)\n  LOGICAL :: ok\n  ! Check if the four_chars contains \"AGC\" as a substring\n  ! Also check after swapping adjacent characters\n  ! First check original\n  ok = .TRUE.\n  ! Check for \"AGC\" in original\n  IF ( (four_chars(1)==0 .AND. four_chars(2)==2 .AND. four_chars(3)==1) .OR. &\n       (four_chars(2)==0 .AND. four_chars(3)==2 .AND. four_chars(4)==1) ) THEN\n    ok = .FALSE.\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  ! Now check swaps\n  DO i = 1, 3\n    ! Create a temporary array\n    INTEGER :: temp(4)\n    temp = four_chars\n    ! Swap i and i+1\n    temp(i) = four_chars(i+1)\n    temp(i+1) = four_chars(i)\n    ! Check if any triplet in temp has \"AGC\"\n    IF ( (temp(1)==0 .AND. temp(2)==2 .AND. temp(3)==1) .OR. &\n         (temp(2)==0 .AND. temp(3)==2 .AND. temp(4)==1) ) THEN\n      ok = .FALSE.\n      RETURN\n    END IF\n  END DO\n  ok = .TRUE.\nEND FUNCTION isOK\n\nWait, but in the code above, the four_chars are the four characters (c1, c2, c3, c4). The first check is for the first three (c1,c2,c3) and the next three (c2,c3,c4). The swapped versions are checked similarly.\n\nWait, the code above checks after swapping, the first three and the next three of the swapped array. That should cover all possible triplets in the four-character string after the swap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check the entire four-character string after the swap for \"AGC\" as a substring. But the code above is checking the first three and the next three, which is equivalent to checking all possible triplets in the four-character string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check the entire four-character string for \"AGC\" as a substring. To do that, perhaps better to convert the four characters to a string and check for the substring.\n\nBut in Fortran, converting the four characters to a string can be done with a lookup array:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=1), DIMENSION(0:3) :: char_map = (/ 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' /)\n\nThen, the original four_chars can be converted to a string s:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=4) :: s\ns(1:1) = char_map(four_chars(1))\ns(2:2) = char_map(four_chars(2))\ns(3:3) = char_map(four_chars(3))\ns(4:4) = char_map(four_chars(4))\n\nThen, check if INDEX(s, 'AGC') >0 \u2192 if yes, return .FALSE.\n\nSimilarly, after swapping, create the new string and check.\n\nThis might be more straightforward.\n\nSo modifying the isOK function:\n\nFUNCTION isOK(four_chars) RESULT(ok)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: four_chars(4)\n  LOGICAL :: ok\n  CHARACTER(LEN=4) :: s, s_swapped\n  ok = .TRUE.\n  ! Check original\n  s = char_map(four_chars(1)) // char_map(four_chars(2)) // char_map(four_chars(3)) // char_map(four_chars(4))\n  IF (INDEX(s, 'AGC') >0) THEN\n    ok = .FALSE.\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  ! Check swaps\n  DO i = 1, 3\n    s_swapped = s\n    ! Swap characters at positions i and i+1 (1-based)\n    CHARACTER(LEN=1) :: temp\n    temp = s_swapped(i:i)\n    s_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\n    s_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp\n    IF (INDEX(s_swapped, 'AGC') >0) THEN\n      ok = .FALSE.\n      RETURN\n    END IF\n  END DO\n  ok = .TRUE.\nEND FUNCTION isOK\n\nThis approach might be clearer and easier to code.\n\nNow, the iterative DP steps:\n\nInitialize the memo array. Since in Fortran, arrays are static, we need to declare the memo array with dimensions (0:N, 0:63). But since N is read from input (X), which can vary, we need to use allocatable arrays.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\nRead N = X.\n\nAllocate memo(0:N, 0:63) as an integer array, with kind=8 (since MOD is 1e9+7, which is 10^9+7, so 32-bit integers can hold it).\n\nInitialize all elements to 0.\n\nSet memo(0, 63) = 1.\n\nThen loop over current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   DO current = 0, N-1\n      DO state = 0, 63\n         IF (memo(current, state) ==0) CYCLE\n         ! Get the previous three characters from the state\n         ! The state is c1*16 + c2*4 + c3\n         c1 = state / 16\n         c2 = (state /4) mod4\n         c3 = state mod4\n         ! The four characters when adding next_char will be c1,c2,c3, next_char\n         DO next_char =0,3\n             four_chars = [c1, c2, c3, next_char]\n             IF (isOK(four_chars)) THEN\n                 new_state = ( (state mod16)*4 + next_char )\n                 memo(current+1, new_state) = MOD( memo(current+1, new_state) + memo(current, state), MOD )\n             END IF\n         END DO\n      END DO\n   END DO\n\nWait, but in the code above, the four_chars array is [c1, c2, c3, next_char], which is the four characters. The isOK function checks this.\n\nWait, but the four_chars array is of length 4, so in Fortran, we can pass it as an array.\n\nWait, in the code above, the variables c1, c2, c3 are derived from the state:\n\nstate = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3 \u2192 so:\n\nc1 = state /16 \u2192 integer division.\n\nc2 = (state - c1*16)/4 \u2192 but (state//4) mod4 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nstate = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3.\n\nDivided by 16 \u2192 c1 + (c2*4 +c3)/16 \u2192 but since c2 is 0-3, (c2*4 +c3) is 0-15, so integer division by 16 gives c1.\n\nThen, (state mod 16) = c2*4 +c3.\n\nThen, c2 = (state mod16)/4 \u2192 (c2*4 +c3)/4 \u2192 c2 + (c3)/4 \u2192 but since c3 is 0-3, integer division by4 gives c2.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute:\n\nc1 = state / 16\n\nremainder = state mod16\n\nc2 = remainder /4\n\nc3 = remainder mod4\n\nYes:\n\nc1 = state /16\n\nremainder = state - c1*16 \u2192 which is c2*4 +c3.\n\nc2 = remainder /4 \u2192 (c2*4 +c3)/4 \u2192 c2 + (c3)/4 \u2192 but since c3 is 0-3, integer division gives c2.\n\nc3 = remainder mod4 \u2192 (c2*4 +c3) mod4 \u2192 c3.\n\nThus:\n\nc1 = state /16\n\nc2 = (state mod16)/4\n\nc3 = (state mod16) mod4\n\nThus, the code can compute c1, c2, c3 correctly.\n\nOnce the four_chars array is built, we can call isOK(four_chars).\n\nIf it returns .TRUE., then compute new_state as ( (state mod16)*4 + next_char )\n\nBecause:\n\nThe new_state is (c2, c3, next_char) \u2192 which is:\n\nnew_state = c2*16 + c3*4 + next_char \u2192 which is ( (c2*4 +c3)*4 ) + next_char \u2192 ( (state mod16) *4 + next_char )\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code for the DP is manageable.\n\nFinally, after filling the memo array, the result is the sum over all states of memo(N, state).\n\nThus, Z = sum( memo(N, 0:63 ) ) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the third part is to compute the third program's output based on Z.\n\nThe third program's formula is (Z//3)*2 + (1 if Z mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nresult_third = (Z /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(Z,3)/=0)\n\nFinally, output that result.\n\nPutting all together in Fortran code.\n\nNow, handling the first part's input:\n\nRead first line: two strings.\n\nIn Fortran, to read two strings from a line, perhaps:\n\nRead(*, '(A)') line1\n\nThen split into two parts. For example:\n\nRead(line1, *) str1, str2\n\nBut if the line has more than two words, but according to the first Java code, the first line is split into a string array via split(\" \"), so it's split on any whitespace, but the code uses the first element (str[0]).\n\nAssuming the first line has exactly two words, then:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: line1, str1, str2\n\nread(*, '(A)') line1\n\nread(line1, *) str1, str2\n\nThen, the third line is u:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: u\n\nread(*, '(A)') u\n\nThen, check if u == str1.\n\nIf yes \u2192 X = a-1, Y =b.\n\nElse \u2192 X =a, Y =b-1.\n\nThe second line is read as two integers a and b:\n\nread(*, *) a, b\n\nWait, the second line in the first Java program is read via in.readLine() \u2192 then split into tokens. So in Fortran, the second line can be read as two integers:\n\nread(*, *) a, b\n\nThus, the first part's code:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: line1, str1, str2, u\ninteger :: a, b, X, Y\n\nread(*, '(A)') line1\nread(line1, *) str1, str2\nread(*, *) a, b\nread(*, '(A)') u\n\nif (u == str1) then\n   X = a -1\n   Y = b\nelse\n   X = a\n   Y = b -1\nend if\n\nNow, the second part's N is X.\n\nBut we need to ensure that X is a valid input for the second program. The second program's N is the input, so X must be a non-negative integer. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps it's given properly.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nWe need to compute Z based on N = X.\n\nFirst, define the constants:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ncharacter(LEN=1), dimension(0:3) :: char_map = (/ 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' /)\n\nThen, the isOK function as above.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't be inside the main program. So the isOK function must be a separate function, possibly inside a module, but for simplicity, we can write it as an internal function or a contained function.\n\nAlternatively, write it as a function inside the main program.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90+, you can have internal functions.\n\nThus, the code would have:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  ! declarations for first part\n  ! ... variables for first part ...\n\n  ! declarations for second part\n  integer :: N, Z\n  integer, allocatable :: memo(:,:)\n  ! ... other variables ...\n\n  ! first part code ...\n\n  N = X\n\n  ! second part code ...\n\n  ! compute Z via DP\n\n  ! third part code ...\n\n  ! output the result\nend program main\n\nInside the program, the isOK function can be an internal function.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  character(len=100) :: line1, str1, str2, u\n  integer :: a, b, X, Y, N, Z\n  integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n  character(LEN=1), dimension(0:3) :: char_map = (/ 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' /)\n  integer, allocatable :: memo(:,:)\n  integer :: current, state, c1, c2, c3, next_char, new_state\n  integer :: i, temp, total\n  logical :: ok\n  integer(8) :: temp_memo\n\n  ! First part: read inputs and compute X and Y\n  read(*, '(A)') line1\n  read(line1, *) str1, str2\n  read(*, *) a, b\n  read(*, '(A)') u\n\n  if (u == str1) then\n     X = a -1\n     Y = b\n  else\n     X = a\n     Y = b -1\n  end if\n\n  N = X\n\n  ! Second part: compute Z using DP\n  allocate( memo(0:N, 0:63) )\n  memo = 0\n  memo(0, 63) = 1  ! initial state is TTT (3,3,3) \u2192 state 63\n\n  do current = 0, N-1\n     do state = 0, 63\n        if (memo(current, state) ==0) cycle\n        c1 = state /16\n        remainder = state mod16\n        c2 = remainder /4\n        c3 = remainder mod4\n        do next_char =0,3\n           integer :: four_chars(4)\n           four_chars = [c1, c2, c3, next_char]\n           ok = isOK(four_chars)\n           if (ok) then\n              new_state = ( (state mod16)*4 + next_char )\n              memo(current+1, new_state) = mod( memo(current+1, new_state) + memo(current, state), MOD )\n           end if\n        end do\n     end do\n  end do\n\n  total = 0\n  do state =0,63\n     total = mod( total + memo(N, state), MOD )\n  end do\n  Z = total\n\n  ! Third part: compute the result\n  integer :: result_third\n  result_third = (Z /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(Z,3)/=0)\n\n  print *, result_third\n\ncontains\n\n  logical function isOK(four_chars)\n    integer, intent(in) :: four_chars(4)\n    character(len=4) :: s, s_swapped\n    integer :: i, temp_char\n    s = char_map(four_chars(1)) // char_map(four_chars(2)) // char_map(four_chars(3)) // char_map(four_chars(4))\n    if (index(s, 'AGC') >0) then\n       isOK = .false.\n       return\n    end if\n    do i =1,3\n       s_swapped = s\n       temp_char = ichar(s_swapped(i:i))\n       s_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\n       s_swapped(i+1:i+1) = char(temp_char)\n       if (index(s_swapped, 'AGC') >0) then\n          isOK = .false.\n          return\n       end if\n    end do\n    isOK = .true.\n  end function isOK\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, the memo array is of type integer. However, since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a large number, and the DP can accumulate up to MOD, the values can be stored as 32-bit integers (since 1e9+7 is less than 2^31). So using integer(kind=4) is sufficient. But in Fortran, the default integer is often 4 bytes, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the memo is declared as integer, which is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, when adding memo(current, state) to memo(current+1, new_state), we need to use modulo MOD each time to prevent overflow. The mod function is applied each step.\n\nNow, checking the swapping part in the isOK function:\n\nIn the code above, when swapping characters, the code uses:\n\ntemp_char = ichar(s_swapped(i:i))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because s_swapped is a character string, and to swap the characters at positions i and i+1, we can do:\n\ntemp_char = s_swapped(i:i)\ns_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\ns_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp_char\n\nBut in Fortran, characters can be assigned directly.\n\nAlternatively, using:\n\ntemp_char = s_swapped(i:i)\ns_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\ns_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp_char\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables must be of the same type. Since s_swapped is a character, temp_char should be a character variable.\n\nThus, in the isOK function:\n\ncharacter(LEN=1) :: temp_char\n\ntemp_char = s_swapped(i:i)\ns_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\ns_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp_char\n\nThus, the code should be adjusted.\n\nAlso, in the code above, the variables 'remainder' is used but not declared. Need to add:\n\ninteger :: remainder\n\nInside the loop over current and state.\n\nSo, in the second part's code:\n\nInside the loop over current and state:\n\nremainder = state mod16\n\nThus, adding 'integer :: remainder' in the declarations.\n\nAlso, in the code, the memo array is of type integer, but when adding, the mod is applied. Since the values can be up to MOD, which is 1e9+7, which is less than 2^30, so 32-bit integers are sufficient.\n\nNow, compiling all corrections:\n\nThe corrected code would have:\n\nInside the program:\n\n  ! Second part: compute Z using DP\n  allocate( memo(0:N, 0:63) )\n  memo = 0\n  memo(0, 63) = 1  ! initial state is TTT (3,3,3) \u2192 state 63\n\n  do current = 0, N-1\n     do state = 0, 63\n        if (memo(current, state) ==0) cycle\n        c1 = state /16\n        remainder = state mod16\n        c2 = remainder /4\n        c3 = remainder mod4\n        do next_char =0,3\n           integer :: four_chars(4)\n           four_chars = [c1, c2, c3, next_char]\n           ok = isOK(four_chars)\n           if (ok) then\n              new_state = ( (state mod16)*4 + next_char )\n              memo(current+1, new_state) = mod( memo(current+1, new_state) + memo(current, state), MOD )\n           end if\n        end do\n     end do\n  end do\n\nBut 'remainder' is declared inside the loop? No, it's inside the loop over state, so it should be declared as an integer variable in the outer scope.\n\nThus, in the declarations:\n\ninteger :: current, state, c1, c2, c3, next_char, new_state, remainder, i, temp, total\n\nNow, the isOK function:\n\nInside the isOK function:\n\ncharacter(LEN=1) :: temp_char\n\nThus, the function becomes:\n\nlogical function isOK(four_chars)\n    integer, intent(in) :: four_chars(4)\n    character(len=4) :: s, s_swapped\n    integer :: i\n    character(LEN=1) :: temp_char\n    s = char_map(four_chars(1)) // char_map(four_chars(2)) // char_map(four_chars(3)) // char_map(four_chars(4))\n    if (index(s, 'AGC') >0) then\n       isOK = .false.\n       return\n    end if\n    do i =1,3\n       s_swapped = s\n       temp_char = s_swapped(i:i)\n       s_swapped(i:i) = s_swapped(i+1:i+1)\n       s_swapped(i+1:i+1) = temp_char\n       if (index(s_swapped, 'AGC') >0) then\n          isOK = .false.\n          return\n       end if\n    end do\n    isOK = .true.\n  end function isOK\n\nNow, this should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nFor example, if N=0, but according to the problem's constraints, N is probably at least 1. But the code should handle it.\n\nAnother test case: when N=3, and the initial state is TTT (63).\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final Fortran code."
