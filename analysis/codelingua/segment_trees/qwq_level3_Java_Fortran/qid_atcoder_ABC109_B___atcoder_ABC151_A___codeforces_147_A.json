Wait, in Java, the first loop is for (int i=0; i<N; i++) map.put(i, sc.next()); so the keys are 0-based, but the values are the strings. Then in the second loop, they check if the current string is already in the past map (which contains all previous entries). So the uniqueness check is that all strings are distinct. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to N (assuming 1-based), check if any of the previous strings (1 to i-1) is equal to the current string. If any, then answer is \"No\".",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC109_B) reads N strings, checks if each subsequent string starts with the last character of the previous one and that all are unique. It outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string, and seems to print the next character after the first character of the input. Wait, looking at the code, it's s.charAt(0) + 1. Wait, but in Java, characters are treated as their ASCII values. So if the input is \"a\", it would output 'b', but if it's \"z\", it would be '{'? Hmm, but maybe the input is a single character? The code reads a line, then takes the first character. So the output is the next character in ASCII.\n\nThe third file (codeforces_147_A) processes a string, splitting words at non-letters, adding spaces between words, and keeping punctuation. For example, \"Hello,world!\" becomes \"Hello, world!\".\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these three Java programs into a single Fortran program. The input comes from the first program, and the output is from the third. The intermediate steps must process data without I/O.\n\nSo the flow is: input -> first Java's processing -> second Java's processing -> third Java's processing -> output.\n\nWait, but the original Java programs are run in sequence, so the output of the first is input to the second, and the second's output to the third. So the Fortran program must do all three steps in sequence, with data passed between them in memory.\n\nFirst, I need to model each Java program's processing as a function in Fortran, with the first reading input, then passing data to the second, then to the third, and finally outputting the result.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\nFirst Java program (File 1):\n\n- Reads N, then N strings.\n- Checks two conditions:\n   1. All strings are unique (since past containsValue checks for duplicates)\n   2. Each string after the first starts with the last character of the previous string.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond Java program (File 2):\n\n- Takes a string (from first's output?), but the first's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". Wait, but the second program's input is a string, which is read via BufferedReader. So the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. The second program takes the first character of that input string and adds 1 to its ASCII value, then prints that character.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program takes the first character 'Y' (ASCII 89), adds 1 to get 90, which is 'Z', so output is 'Z'. If first outputs \"No\", then first character 'N' (78) becomes 79 'O'.\n\nSo the second program's output is a single character: the next ASCII character after the first character of the first program's output.\n\nThird program (File 3):\n\nTakes a string (from second's output, which is a single character?), but that can't be right. Wait, the second program's output is a single character, like 'Z', then the third program would read that as input. But the third program's code is processing a string, splitting on non-letters, etc. But a single character input would be processed as is, unless it's a punctuation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see the exact flow:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" -> that is the input to Program2, which takes the first character, adds 1, outputs that character (e.g., 'Y' becomes 'Z'). Then Program3 takes that single character as input, and processes it. Since the third program's processing is adding spaces between words, but if the input is a single character (like 'Z'), then the output would be the same as the input, since there's no splitting needed. Unless the character is punctuation, but 'Z' is a letter. So the third program would output the same character.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me recheck:\n\nThe first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program takes that as input, reads the first character (e.g., 'Y' or 'N'), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that single character. The third program then takes that single character as input. Since the third program's processing is about splitting words, but a single character is just a single character, so the output would be the same as the input. Unless the input is a punctuation, but in this case, the second program's output is a letter (since 'Y' +1 is 'Z', 'N' +1 is 'O'), so the third program would just output that same character.\n\nWait, but maybe the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a single character. So the third program's processing would just output that same character, since there's no splitting needed. So the final output would be the character from the second program.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is more complex. Let me look again:\n\nThird program's code:\n\nIt reads a line, then builds a string. The first character is added. Then for each next character:\n\n- If it's a Latin letter, check if previous was a Latin letter. If not, add a space before adding the current character.\n\n- If it's punctuation, just add it.\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"Z\", then the first character is 'Z', then the loop starts at i=1 (since n=1, so loop doesn't run). So the output is \"Z\".\n\nSo the final output of the entire chain would be the character from the second program, which is the first character of the first program's output plus 1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Let's see:\n\nIf first program outputs \"Yes\", then second program's output is 'Y' +1 \u2192 'Z', so third outputs 'Z'.\n\nIf first outputs \"No\", then second outputs 'N' +1 \u2192 'O', third outputs 'O'.\n\nSo the entire sequence's final output is either 'Z' or 'O', depending on the first program's result.\n\nWait, but the third program's code may have more steps. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nThe input is a string (from second's output, which is a single character). The first character is added to the string. Then for each next character (but there are none, since length is 1). So the output is the same as the input. So the final output is the single character from the second program.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is the first character of the first program's output plus 1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the first character is 'Y' or 'N', so the final output is 'Z' or 'O'.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input (for the first program's processing), compute whether the first program would output \"Yes\" or \"No\", then compute the next character, and output that.\n\nWait, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So the Fortran program must read the input (for the first Java program), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read N and N strings (from input).\n\n2. Process them as per the first Java program to determine if \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take the first character of that result (either 'Y' or 'N'), add 1 to its ASCII value, get the new character (Z or O).\n\n4. Then process that character through the third Java's logic, which in this case just outputs the same character (since it's a single letter).\n\nTherefore, the final output is the character from step 3.\n\nWait, but the third program's processing may not change it. So the final output is the character from step 3.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read N and the N strings.\n\n- Check the conditions of the first Java program (uniqueness and chain of first/last characters).\n\n- Determine the result string (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n- Take the first character of that result, add 1 to its ASCII code, get the new character.\n\n- Then, process that character through the third program's logic (which in this case, since it's a single character, just outputs it).\n\nWait, but the third program's processing is more involved. Let me think again.\n\nThe third program's processing is:\n\nInput is a string (from second's output, which is a single character). The code builds a new string by:\n\n- Appending the first character.\n\n- Then for each next character (starting at i=1):\n\n   - If the current character is a Latin letter:\n\n      - If the previous character was not a Latin letter, add a space before adding the current character.\n\n   - If it's punctuation, just add it.\n\nBut in the case of a single character input (length 1), the loop from i=1 to n-1 (since n=1, the loop doesn't run). So the output is the same as the input. So the third program's output is the same as the second's output.\n\nTherefore, the final output is the character from the second step.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be structured to compute the first program's result, then compute the next character, and output that.\n\nWait, but the third program's code may have other steps. Let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose the first program outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSecond program's output is 'Z'.\n\nThird program's input is \"Z\", so the output is \"Z\".\n\nAnother example: first outputs \"No\" \u2192 second outputs 'O' \u2192 third outputs 'O'.\n\nTherefore, the final output is the character from the second step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to:\n\n1. Read N and the N strings.\n\n2. Check the conditions (uniqueness and chain) \u2192 decide \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take the first character of that result, add 1 to its ASCII value (as an integer), convert back to a character.\n\n4. Output that character.\n\nWait, but the third program's processing is required even if it's redundant here. But according to the problem statement, the entire sequence must be translated, so even if the third program's processing is redundant in this case, we have to model it.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, the input is read as a line. So if the second program's output is a single character, then the third program's input is that character as a string. The third program's processing would just output the same character. So in the Fortran code, after getting the second step's character, we can just output it, but perhaps the third program's code requires that we process it through the same logic.\n\nHmm, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So even if the third program's processing is redundant here, we have to model it.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, the processing is:\n\nTake the input string, and build a new string by adding spaces between words. But in the case of a single character (like 'Z'), the output is the same as the input. So the third program's processing doesn't change it. Therefore, the final output is the same as the second program's output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after computing the second step's character, we can just output it. But to be precise, perhaps we need to model the third program's processing even if it's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third program's processing could have different behavior. Let me think of another scenario. Suppose the second program's output is a punctuation character. For example, if the first program outputs \"No\", then second outputs 'O', which is a letter, so third outputs 'O'. But if the first program's output was \"No!\", then the second program would take the first character 'N', add 1 to get 'O', then third program would process \"O\" \u2192 same as before. Wait, but the first program's output can only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second program's input is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second program's input is exactly that. So the second program's output is the first character of that string plus 1. So the third program's input is a single character (since the second program's output is a single character). Therefore, the third program's processing leaves it unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final output is the second program's output, which is the first character of the first program's output plus 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\n- Read N and the N strings.\n\n- Check the conditions (uniqueness and chain) \u2192 decide \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n- Take the first character of that result (either 'Y' or 'N'), add 1 to its ASCII code (using ichar and char functions in Fortran).\n\n- Output that character.\n\nWait, but the third program's processing is required. Let me think again. The third program's code is:\n\nRead the input string (from second's output, which is a single character). Then process it as per the rules. Since the input is a single character, the processing is:\n\nThe first character is added to the string. Then, since there are no more characters (length is 1), the result is the same as the input. So the third program's output is the same as the second's output. So the final output is the second's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can just compute the second's output and print it. But to be precise, perhaps the third program's code must be modeled even if it's redundant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where the second program's output is a punctuation, but in our scenario, it's not. Let me see:\n\nThe first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The first character is 'Y' or 'N', which are letters. So the second program's output is a letter (since adding 1 to 'Y' gives 'Z', 'N' gives 'O'). The third program's processing of a single letter would just output the same letter. So the third program's processing is redundant here, but must be included in the code.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after getting the second step's character (the result of the second program), we need to process it through the third program's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read N and the N strings.\n\n2. Check the first program's conditions \u2192 get \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value \u2192 get char2.\n\n4. Now, process char2 through the third program's logic.\n\n   The third program's processing is:\n\n   - The input is a string (char2 as a string).\n\n   - The first character is added to the output.\n\n   - Then, for each next character (none here), check if it's a letter, etc.\n\n   So the output is the same as the input (char2).\n\nTherefore, the final output is char2.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can be written to compute char2 and output it.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should model the third step's processing even if it's redundant.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first step: reading N and N strings.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read from stdin. The first block must handle reading input.\n\nSecond, process the N strings to check the conditions.\n\nThird, compute the next character.\n\nFourth, process that character through the third program's logic.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read N, then N strings. Let's use an array of strings.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be read with read(*,*) but for multiple words, perhaps using a loop.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, each string is read via sc.next(), which reads the next token. So each string is a single token, separated by whitespace. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read each string as a single word.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead N.\n\nThen read N strings, each as a single word.\n\nThen check the conditions:\n\nCheck that all strings are unique.\n\nCheck that each subsequent string starts with the last character of the previous.\n\nWait, how to check uniqueness?\n\nWe can have an array of the strings, and for each i, check if any previous string is the same.\n\nAlternatively, since in Java they used a HashMap, but in Fortran, perhaps a simple array and loop.\n\nFirst, store the strings in an array.\n\nThen, for uniqueness:\n\nLoop over each pair of indices (i,j) where i < j, and check if strings(i) == strings(j). If any such pair exists, then the answer is \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, for each i from 0 to N-1 (assuming 0-based), check if any previous string (from 0 to i-1) is equal to current.\n\nWait, in Java, the first loop is for (int i=0; i<N; i++) map.put(i, sc.next()); so the keys are 0-based, but the values are the strings. Then in the second loop, they check if the current string is already in the past map (which contains all previous entries). So the uniqueness check is that all strings are distinct.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to N (assuming 1-based), check if any of the previous strings (1 to i-1) is equal to the current string. If any, then answer is \"No\".\n\nThen, the second condition: each string after the first must start with the last character of the previous string.\n\nSo for i from 2 to N:\n\n   previous string is strings(i-1)\n\n   current string is strings(i)\n\n   check that the first character of current is equal to the last character of previous.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based? Or 0-based? In Fortran, strings are 1-based by default.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the first character is at position 1.\n\nSo for each i from 2 to N:\n\n   prev_str = strings(i-1)\n\n   current_str = strings(i)\n\n   if (current_str(1:1) /= prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))) then \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, the code for the first part:\n\nInitialize answer as .true.\n\nCheck uniqueness:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (strings(i) == strings(j)) then\n\n         answer = .false.\n\n         exit the loops\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. answer) exit\n\nend do\n\nThen, check the chain condition:\n\nif (answer) then\n\n   do i = 2, N\n\n      prev_str = strings(i-1)\n\n      current_str = strings(i)\n\n      if (current_str(1:1) /= prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))) then\n\n         answer = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nOnce answer is determined, then proceed.\n\nThen, the second step: take the first character of the answer string (\"Yes\" or \"No\"), add 1 to its ASCII code.\n\nThe answer string is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo first_char = answer_str(1:1)\n\nIn Fortran, to get the ASCII code: ichar(first_char)\n\nAdd 1, then convert back to character: char(ichar(first_char)+1)\n\nSo:\n\nif (answer) then\n\n   ans_str = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   ans_str = 'No'\n\nend if\n\nchar2 = ans_str(1:1)\n\nchar2_ascii = ichar(char2) + 1\n\nchar2_new = char(char2_ascii)\n\nNow, the third step: process this character through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's processing is:\n\nInput is a string (char2_new as a single character string).\n\nThe processing is:\n\n- The first character is added to the output.\n\n- For each next character (there are none here), check if it's a Latin letter, etc.\n\nSo the output is the same as the input.\n\nTherefore, the final output is char2_new.\n\nBut to model the third program's processing, even if redundant, let's do it.\n\nThe third program's processing steps:\n\nThe input is a string s (char2_new as a string).\n\nThe output is built as follows:\n\nInitialize a string (Fortran's character array or variable).\n\nAppend the first character.\n\nThen for each character from the second to the end:\n\n   if it's a Latin letter (a-z):\n\n      if the previous character was not a Latin letter, add a space before adding it.\n\n   else if punctuation (.,!?), add it.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = char2_new\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nif (n == 0) then \u2192 but in our case, it's a single character.\n\noutput_str = s(1:1)\n\ndo i = 2, n\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (is_latin(c)) then\n\n      prev_char = s(i-1:i-1)\n\n      if (.not. is_latin(prev_char)) then\n\n         output_str = trim(output_str) // ' '\n\n      end if\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // c\n\n   else if (is_punctuation(c)) then\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // c\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since n is 1, the loop doesn't run. So output_str is s(1:1).\n\nTherefore, the final output is char2_new.\n\nThus, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead N, read N strings.\n\nCheck the conditions to get answer.\n\nCompute the new character.\n\nOutput that character.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need an array to hold the N strings. Let's assume each string is up to, say, 1000 characters. So:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: strings(1000)\n\ninteger :: N, i, j\n\nlogical :: answer = .true.\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: ans_str\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_char, char2, char2_new\n\nThen, read N:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nThen read N strings:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   read(*,*) strings(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen check uniqueness:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (strings(i) == strings(j)) then\n\n         answer = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. answer) exit\n\nend do\n\nThen check the chain condition:\n\nif (answer) then\n\n   do i = 2, N\n\n      prev_str = strings(i-1)\n\n      current_str = strings(i)\n\n      if (current_str(1:1) /= prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))) then\n\n         answer = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nThen set ans_str:\n\nif (answer) then\n\n   ans_str = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   ans_str = 'No'\n\nend if\n\nThen compute the next character:\n\nchar2 = ans_str(1:1)\n\nchar2_ascii = ichar(char2) + 1\n\nchar2_new = char(char2_ascii)\n\nThen, process through third program's logic (even though redundant):\n\ns = char2_new\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\noutput_str = s(1:1)\n\ndo i = 2, n\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (is_latin(c)) then\n\n      prev_char = s(i-1:i-1)\n\n      if (.not. is_latin(prev_char)) then\n\n         output_str = trim(output_str) // ' '\n\n      end if\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // c\n\n   else if (is_punctuation(c)) then\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // c\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since n is 1, output_str is s(1:1).\n\nThus, the final output is output_str.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps we can skip the third step's processing and just output char2_new. But to be precise, the third program's code must be modeled.\n\nAlternatively, since the third program's processing is required, even if redundant, we need to code it.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions for is_latin and is_punctuation are needed.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\nFunction is_latin(c) result(res)\n\n   character(len=1), intent(in) :: c\n\n   logical :: res\n\n   res = (ichar(c) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('z'))\n\nend function\n\nFunction is_punctuation(c) result(res)\n\n   character(len=1), intent(in) :: c\n\n   logical :: res\n\n   res = (c == '.' .or. c == ',' .or. c == '!' .or. c == '?')\n\nend function\n\nThese functions can be placed in the program.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: N, i, j\n\n   logical :: answer = .true.\n\n   character(len=1000), dimension(1000) :: strings\n\n   character(len=3) :: ans_str\n\n   character(len=1) :: char2, char2_new\n\n   character(len=1) :: s\n\n   character(len=1000) :: output_str\n\n   !

However, the code must be there to model the third program's processing.\n\nWait, in the third program's code, the processing is:\n\nThe input is read as a line (s = br.readLine()), then the processing is done on that string.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the third step's processing is:\n\ns is set to char2_new (the single character), then the processing is done as per the third program's logic.\n\nBut in the code above, the loop for i=2 to len_trim(s) is present but does nothing. So the output_str is correctly set to s(1:1).\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, the output is printed with a new line. The third program uses PrintWriter.println, which adds a new line. The first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without new line?), but in Java, System.out.println adds a new line. So the second program's input is the first's output with a new line? Or not?\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the output is System.out.println(\"Yes\") or \"No\", which adds a new line. The second program reads the line via readLine(), which includes the new line? Or not? The readLine() method reads up to the newline and excludes it. So the first program's output is \"Yes\\n\", so the second program reads \"Yes\" as the line. So the first character is 'Y'.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first Java program, the strings are read via sc.next(), which reads tokens separated by whitespace. In Fortran, the read(*,*) statement reads until whitespace, so that's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\nbcd\n\ndef\n\nCheck uniqueness: all unique.\n\nCheck chain: 'c' is last of first, next starts with 'b'? No. Wait first string is \"abc\" ends with 'c', next is \"bcd\" starts with 'b' \u2192 so condition fails. So answer is \"No\".\n\nSecond step: 'N' \u2192 'O'.\n\nThird step: outputs 'O'.\n\nSo the final output is 'O'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\ncde\n\nefg\n\nCheck uniqueness: yes.\n\nCheck chain: 'c' (end of first) \u2192 next starts with 'c' \u2192 yes. Then 'e' (end of second) \u2192 next starts with 'e' \u2192 yes. So answer is \"Yes\".\n\nSecond step: 'Y' \u2192 'Z'.\n\nThird step: outputs 'Z'.\n\nThus, the code should output 'Z'.\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs \"No\" because of duplicate strings:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\nab\n\nab\n\nThen uniqueness check fails \u2192 answer is \"No\".\n\nSecond step: 'N' \u2192 'O'.\n\nOutput is 'O'.\n\nAnother case where the chain condition fails but uniqueness holds:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\nab\n\ncd\n\nUniqueness holds. But 'b' vs 'c' \u2192 chain fails \u2192 answer \"No\".\n\nSecond step: 'N' \u2192 'O'.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the third step's processing is correctly modeled even if redundant.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as written above."
