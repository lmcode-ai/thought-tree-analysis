    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file (codeforces_106_B). It reads an integer n, then n lines each with four integers. It then checks for each entry if there's no other entry that has all three of the first values (maybe dimensions?) higher. If an entry is not dominated, it keeps track of the one with the lowest price (third value?), and outputs the index (1-based) of the best one. Wait, actually, looking at the code, the third value is the price? Wait, the code uses vec[i][3] as the price. The first three elements are the first three numbers, and the fourth is the price. The loop checks if any other entry has all three of the first three values greater than the current entry's. If not, then it considers the price. The answer is the index (starting at 1) of the entry with the minimum price among those not dominated.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_58_B) takes an integer n, then outputs n followed by the largest possible sequence of numbers decreasing by factors. It starts with n, then finds the largest i less than n that divides n, then the next largest that divides that, etc. So for example, if n is 6, it would output 6 3 1? Wait, no, let me see. The code loops from n-1 down to 1, and whenever m (initially n) is divisible by i, it prints i and sets m to i. So for n=6, first it checks 5: 6 mod 5 is 1, so no. 4 mod 6? Wait, no, m is 6, so 6 mod 4 is 2, so no. 3 mod 6? 6 mod 3 is 0, so yes. So it prints 3, then m becomes 3. Then next i is 2: 3 mod 2 is 1, so no. Then 1: 3 mod 1 is 0, so print 1. So the output would be \"6 3 1 \" (with spaces). Wait, but the code's first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which adds a space. Then the loop adds more numbers with spaces. So the output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, ending with a space? Or maybe each print statement adds a space. The code for the second file's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (m % i == 0) {\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n        m = i;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, no, the first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print n followed by a space, then a new line? Wait, no, the method is System.out.println, which adds a new line. Wait, but in Java, the code for the second file's first line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWait, that would print n followed by a space, then a new line. Then the loop's print statements also use println, so each number is on its own line with a space at the end? That might be an issue. Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to output all numbers in a single line? Let me check the code again. The first line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWait, that would print n followed by a space, then a new line. Then the loop's code is:\n\nSystem.out.println(i + \" \");\n\nEach of those would also print the number followed by a space and a new line. So the output would be each number on its own line with a trailing space. But maybe the problem expects them all on one line? Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I have to translate it as is. Alternatively, maybe the code uses print instead of println? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the second Java file's code:\n\nThe first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which is a println, so that's n followed by a space and a new line. Then the loop uses System.out.println(i + \" \"); again, each time adding a new line. So the output would be each number on its own line with a space at the end. But maybe the problem expects them all in one line? The problem might be that the code is written with print instead of println? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the code for the second file's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (m % i == 0) {\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n        m = i;\n    }\n}\n\nAh, so each time it finds a divisor, it prints i followed by a space and a new line. So the output would be each number on its own line. But the first line is n followed by a space and a new line. So the output would be like:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nBut maybe the problem expects all numbers in a single line? The problem description for codeforces 58B might require that, but since I have to translate the code as given, I have to follow exactly what the code does. So the second program's output is each number on its own line with a trailing space and a newline. Hmm, but when the output is used as input for the next program, that might be an issue. Wait, but the second program's output is the input for the third program? Wait, the sequence is first program's output is input to second, second's output to third. Wait, the first program's output is the answer (the index), which is a single number. Then the second program takes that number as input, processes it, and outputs a sequence of numbers. Then the third program takes that sequence as input?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single integer (the ans variable). The second program's input is that integer. The second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on their own line (with a space and newline). Then the third program's input is that output. The third program reads a string (from input), checks if it contains 'A' and 'B'. Wait, but the second program's output is numbers, so the third program would read a string which is the numbers from the second program's output. But the third program expects a single string input. Wait, perhaps the second program's output is a single line? Let me re-examine the code again.\n\nWait, the second Java program's first line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nSo that's n followed by a space and a new line. Then the loop's code is:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (m % i == 0) {\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n        m = i;\n    }\n}\n\nEach time it finds a divisor, it prints i followed by a space and a new line. So the output is multiple lines, each with a number and a space. So the entire output would be something like:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nEach on separate lines. So when this is the input to the third program, which reads a single string (using in.next()), which in Java reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So the third program would read the first token, which is \"6\" (from the first line's n followed by a space and newline). Wait, but the first line's output is \"6 \" followed by a newline. So the first line's content is \"6 \" (with a space), then the next line is \"3 \" etc. So when the third program reads the input, it would read the first token as \"6\", then the next line's first token is \"3\", etc. But the third program's code is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nWhich reads the next token, which is the first word. So in this case, the first token is \"6\", so s would be \"6\", then the rest is ignored. But that would make the third program output \"No\" because \"6\" doesn't contain 'A' or 'B'. But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the second program's output is intended to be a single line? Maybe the code in the second Java program has a mistake, using print instead of println? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the code for the second file:\n\nThe first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which is a println, so that's a line with n followed by a space and a newline. Then the loop uses System.out.println(i + \" \"); again, each time adding a new line. So the output is multiple lines. But the third program expects a single string input. So perhaps the second program's output is not correct, but according to the code, that's how it is. So when the third program runs, it will read the first token (the first number from the first line), which is \"6\", and check if it contains 'A' or 'B', which it doesn't, so output \"No\". But maybe the second program's code is supposed to print all numbers in a single line? Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first line should be System.out.print(n + \" \"), and then the loop uses System.out.print(i + \" \"). That would make the output a single line. But in the given code, it's using println. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I have to translate it as written. So the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output, which is the first line's first token. So the third program would output \"No\" unless the first number is a string containing 'A' and 'B', which it won't be. So the final output of the entire sequence would be \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the flow. Let me retrace:\n\nThe first program's output is a single integer (the ans variable). Let's say the first program outputs 5. Then the second program takes 5 as input. The second program's code reads n as sc.nextInt(), which is 5. Then it outputs 5 followed by a space and a new line. Then the loop starts from 4 down to 1. Let's see for n=5:\n\nThe first line is 5 followed by a space and newline. Then m is 5. The loop checks i=4: 5 mod 4 is 1, so no. i=3: 5 mod 3 is 2, no. i=2: 5 mod 2 is 1, no. i=1: 5 mod 1 is 0, so yes. So it prints 1 followed by a space and newline. So the output is:\n\n5 \n1 \n\nThen the third program reads this input. The third program's code is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nSo in.next() reads the first token, which is \"5\" (from the first line's \"5 \" followed by a newline). The next token would be \"1\" from the second line. But in.next() only takes the first token. So s is \"5\", which doesn't contain A or B, so output is \"No\".\n\nSo the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the second program's output is meant to be all numbers in a single line? Let me check the code again. The code for the second program's first line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nSo that's a println, so the first line ends with a newline. The loop uses println as well. So the output is multiple lines. So the third program will only read the first token, which is the first number. So the third program's output is \"No\" unless the first number is a string containing both A and B, which it won't be. So the final output is \"No\".\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But in Fortran, we can't have intermediate I/O; we have to process all steps in memory.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (the first Java file's input) into Fortran variables.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (the codeforces_106_B logic) to compute the answer (the index).\n\n3. Use that answer as the input to the second program's logic (codeforces_58_B), which processes it and produces a list of numbers (the output of the second program).\n\n4. Then, take that list of numbers and process them through the third program's logic (atcoder_ABC158_A), which checks if the concatenated string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string. The second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on their own line with a space and newline. So when the third program reads it, it would read the first token (the first number), but in the third program's code, it reads the entire string? Wait, no. The third Java program uses in.next(), which reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So the first token is the first number (from the first line's first part). So in the third program's input, the string s is the first token, which is the first number. So in Fortran, the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is multiple lines. So the entire output is a sequence of numbers each on their own line. So when the third program reads the input, it's reading all of that, but in.next() would take the first token (the first number). So the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output. So the third program's output is \"Yes\" only if that first number contains both 'A' and 'B', which it won't because it's a number. So the final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on their own line. The third program reads the entire input as a single string? Or as a sequence of tokens. The third program's code uses in.next(), which reads the next token, which is the first word. So the first token is the first number (like \"5\" in the example). So the third program's s is that first number as a string. Since numbers don't have 'A' or 'B', the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire sequence is \"No\".\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first program's logic:\n\nRead n, then n lines of four integers each. Then for each entry, check if there exists another entry where all three of the first three values are greater. If not, then consider it for the minimum price. The answer is the index (1-based) of the entry with the smallest price among those not dominated.\n\nSecond program's logic:\n\nTake the first program's output (the index) as input n. Then output n followed by a space and a newline. Then, for i from n-1 down to 1, if m (starting at n) is divisible by i, output i followed by a space and a newline, then set m to i.\n\nThird program's logic:\n\nTake the output of the second program (the sequence of numbers) and read the first token (the first number). Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it's a number, it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and the n lines of four integers each).\n\n2. Compute the answer (the index) as per first program's logic.\n\n3. Use that index as the input to the second program's logic, which generates a list of numbers (the output of the second program).\n\n4. Take that list of numbers, convert them into a string (as per the second program's output format), then process that string through the third program's logic (check if the first token has both 'A' and 'B').\n\nWait, but the third program's input is the entire output of the second program. However, in the third program's code, it reads the first token (the first number). So in Fortran, we can process the second program's output as a list of numbers, then the third program's input is the first number in that list. So the third program's output is \"Yes\" only if that first number's string contains both 'A' and 'B', which it won't. So the final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read the input for the first program.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (the index).\n\n- Compute the second program's output (the list of numbers) based on that index.\n\n- Take the first number from that list (the first element, which is the original index) and check if it contains 'A' and 'B' in its string representation. Since it's a number, it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program's first output is the input n (the index from first program). So the first number in the second program's output is exactly the index from the first program. So the third program's input is that number as a string. Since numbers don't have letters, the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\", unless the first program's output is a string containing both 'A' and 'B', which it can't be because it's an integer. So the final output is always \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the second program's first output is the first program's result. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, the second program's first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); where n is the input (the first program's output). So the first number in the second program's output is exactly the first program's output. So the third program's input is that number as a string, so it can't have 'A' or 'B', so output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose the first program's output is 1234AB5, but that's impossible because the first program's output is an integer. The first program's code outputs ans, which is an integer (the index). So the second program's input is that integer, so the first number in its output is that integer. So the third program's input is that integer as a string, which can't have letters. So the output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to compute the first program's result, then compute the second program's output (but only the first number is needed for the third program), then check if that first number's string has 'A' and 'B', which it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the second program's output is more than one number. For example, if the first program's output is 6, then the second program's output is 6, 3, 1. The third program's input is the first token, which is \"6\", so output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of a case where the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string contains 'A' and 'B'? Like 12AB34? But no, the first program's output is an integer, so it can't have letters. So the third program will always output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the second program's code. Let me re-examine the second Java program's code again.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\npublic class codeforces_58_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first line after reading n is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which outputs n followed by a space and a new line. Then the loop starts from n-1 down to 1. So for example, if n is 6:\n\nThe first line is \"6 \" followed by a newline.\n\nThen, m is 6. The loop checks i=5: 6 mod 5 is 1, so no. i=4: 6 mod4 is 2, no. i=3: 6 mod3 is 0, so yes. So print \"3 \" followed by a newline. m becomes 3. Then i=2: 3 mod2 is 1, no. i=1: 3 mod1 is 0, so print \"1 \" followed by a newline. So the output is three lines:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nEach line has the number followed by a space and a newline. So the entire output is three lines. The third program reads the first token, which is \"6\", so the output is \"No\".\n\nAnother example: if the first program's output is 24. Then the second program's output would be 24, 12, 6, 3, 1 (assuming the factors are chosen correctly). The first token is \"24\", so third program outputs \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the first program's result, then compute the second program's first number (which is the first program's result), then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program's first output is exactly the first program's result. So the third program's input is that number as a string, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input for the first program (n and the entries), compute the first program's answer (the index), then compute the second program's first output (which is the index), then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program's first output is exactly the first program's output. So the third program's input is that number, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to compute the first program's answer, then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output, which is the first program's answer. So the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to compute the first program's answer, then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's a big simplification. But according to the logic, yes. Because the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output, which is the first program's answer. Since that's a number, the third program outputs \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the first program's input, compute the first program's answer, then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the third program's logic is always \"No\". But maybe there's a case where the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string contains 'A' and 'B'? Like 12AB34? But no, the first program's output is an integer, so it can't have letters. So the third program will always output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the first program's input, compute the first program's answer (the index), then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's skipping the second program's processing. But according to the problem's requirement, the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So even if the second program's processing is redundant, we have to model it.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is needed for the third program's input. Even though the third program only uses the first number, the second program's processing must be done correctly.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (n and the entries).\n\n2. Compute the first program's answer (index).\n\n3. Use that index as input to the second program's logic, which produces a list of numbers (the output of the second program).\n\n4. Take the first number from that list (which is the index itself) and check if it contains 'A' and 'B' in its string representation. Since it's a number, it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must perform all steps, even if the final result is always \"No\".\n\nNow, let's proceed to code this.\n\nFirst, the first program's logic:\n\nWe need to read n, then n lines of four integers each. Then for each entry, check if it is not dominated by any other entry. A entry is dominated if there exists another entry with all three of the first three values greater. If not dominated, track the one with the smallest price (fourth value). The answer is the index (1-based) of that entry.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, the entries are 0-based. So in Fortran, we can use 1-based indices.\n\nSecond program's logic:\n\nTake the first program's answer (integer) as input n. Then output n followed by a space and a newline. Then, for i from n-1 down to 1, check if m (starting at n) is divisible by i. If yes, output i followed by a space and a newline, then set m to i.\n\nThird program's logic:\n\nTake the output of the second program (the list of numbers) and read the first token (the first number). Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it's a number, output \"No\".\n\nNow, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the first program's input:\n\nRead n, then read n lines of four integers each. Let's store them in an array, say, vec(4, n). Wait, in Fortran, arrays are column-major, but perhaps it's easier to have a 2D array with rows as entries and columns as the four values. Let's say vec(1 to n, 1 to 4).\n\nThen compute the first program's answer:\n\nInitialize ans = 500 (but in Java, it was initialized to 500, but in the code, the index starts at 1, so maybe 500 is a placeholder. Wait, in the Java code, the initial ans is 500, which is probably larger than any possible index (since n can be up to, say, 1e5?), but in the code, the loop checks for each i from 0 to n-1 (Java's 0-based), so the index is i+1. So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the initial ans can be set to a large number, like n+1, but in the code, the initial ans is 500, which may be arbitrary. Anyway, in Fortran, we can initialize ans to a large value, say, 0, and then track properly.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nint ans = 500;\n\nint ansprice = 20000;\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nCheck if the entry is not dominated (fl=1). If so, compare its price (vec[i][3]) to ansprice. If smaller, update ansprice and ans (i+1).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize ans = 0 (or some invalid index), ansprice = a large value (like 20000 as in Java).\n\nLoop over each entry (i from 1 to n):\n\nCheck if there exists any j (from 1 to n) where vec(j,1) > vec(i,1), vec(j,2) > vec(i,2), and vec(j,3) > vec(i,3). If none, then this entry is not dominated.\n\nWait, the first three elements are the first three numbers in each entry. The fourth is the price.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first three elements are vec[i][0], vec[i][1], vec[i][2], and the price is vec[i][3].\n\nSo in Fortran, for entry i (1-based), the first three values are vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), and the price is vec(i,4).\n\nSo the check for dominance is: for any j, if (vec(j,1) > vec(i,1) .and. vec(j,2) > vec(i,2) .and. vec(j,3) > vec(i,3)), then the entry i is dominated.\n\nIf not dominated, then check if its price (vec(i,4)) is less than the current ansprice. If so, update ansprice and ans (the index i).\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nans = 0\n\nansprice = 20000\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    fl = 1\n\n    do j = 1, n\n\n        if (j == i) cycle\n\n        if (vec(j,1) > vec(i,1) .and. vec(j,2) > vec(i,2) .and. vec(j,3) > vec(i,3)) then\n\n            fl = 0\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (fl == 1) then\n\n        if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n            ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n            ans = i\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the ans is the index (1-based) of the best entry.\n\nNext, the second program's logic:\n\nTake ans as input n. Then generate the sequence as per the second program.\n\nWe need to generate the list of numbers output by the second program. The first number is n, then the loop.\n\nIn Fortran, we can store the output numbers in an array. Let's say the maximum possible length is n (but probably less). Let's use a dynamic array or a list. Alternatively, since the second program's output is needed only for the third program's first token, which is the first element (n), we can just note that the first element is n, so the third program's input is n as a string. Therefore, the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program's first output is exactly n (the input to the second program, which is the first program's ans). So the third program's input is the string representation of n, which is a number, so it can't have 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the third program's output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the first program's input, compute the first program's ans, then output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the problem's requirement, we must translate the entire sequence, even if some steps are redundant. So we have to model the second program's processing, even if it's not needed for the final output.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\nSo even if the second program's processing is redundant, we must perform it correctly, because the third program's input depends on the second program's output. Even though in this case the third program's input is the first number of the second program's output, which is the first program's ans, but the second program's processing must be done correctly.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read first program's input.\n\n2. Compute first program's ans.\n\n3. Compute second program's output (the list of numbers).\n\n4. Take the first number from that list (which is ans) and check if it contains 'A' and 'B' in its string form. Since it's a number, output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the code must do all steps.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code this.\n\nFirst, the first program's part:\n\nRead n, then n lines of four integers each.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, fl, ans, ansprice\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vec\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(vec(4, n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read *, vec(1,i), vec(2,i), vec(3,i), vec(4,i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are column-major, so perhaps it's better to have vec(4, n) where each column is an entry. Or maybe rows as entries. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have vec(4, n), where each column is an entry. So vec(1,i) is the first value of the i-th entry.\n\nAlternatively, using a 2D array with rows as entries and columns as the four values. Let's use vec(n,4).\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(vec(n,4))\n\nthen for each i from 1 to n:\n\nread *, vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vec\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(vec(n,4))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read *, vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\nend do\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\nansprice = 20000\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    fl = 1\n\n    do j = 1, n\n\n        if (j == i) cycle\n\n        if (vec(j,1) > vec(i,1) .and. vec(j,2) > vec(i,2) .and. vec(j,3) > vec(i,3)) then\n\n            fl = 0\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (fl == 1) then\n\n        if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n            ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n            ans = i\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nNow, the second program's processing:\n\nThe second program takes ans as input n, then outputs a list of numbers.\n\nWe need to generate this list.\n\nLet's create an array to hold the output numbers.\n\nThe first number is n (ans).\n\nThen, the loop from n-1 down to 1:\n\nm starts as n.\n\nThen for each i from n-1 downto 1:\n\nif m mod i ==0, then add i to the list, set m =i.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: m, current_n, i_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: second_output\n\ncurrent_n = ans\n\nm = current_n\n\nallocate(second_output(1)) ! initial capacity, but need to dynamically grow.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be tricky. Alternatively, we can pre-allocate a large enough array. Let's say the maximum possible length is current_n (since each step reduces m, so the length is at most log2(n) steps plus 1, but to be safe, let's use current_n +1).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a list approach with a counter.\n\nLet's proceed with a dynamic array approach.\n\nInitialize the list with the first element (current_n).\n\nThen, m = current_n.\n\nThen loop i from current_n-1 down to 1:\n\nif mod(m, i) ==0, then append i to the list, set m =i.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: current_n = ans\n\ninteger :: m = current_n\n\ninteger :: count = 1\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: second_output\n\nallocate(second_output(1000)) ! arbitrary large enough size.\n\nsecond_output(1) = current_n\n\ndo i = current_n -1, 1, -1\n\n    if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n        if (count > size(second_output)) then\n\n            ! need to reallocate\n\n            integer :: new_size = 2*size(second_output)\n\n            integer, dimension(new_size) :: temp\n\n            temp(1:size(second_output)) = second_output\n\n            second_output = temp\n\n        end if\n\n        second_output(count) = i\n\n        m = i\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut this is a bit involved. Alternatively, since we only need the first element (the first number in the second program's output is current_n), we can just note that the first element is current_n, so the third program's input is current_n as a string. Therefore, the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nBut to be precise, we must generate the entire second program's output, but since the third program only reads the first token, which is the first element, we can just take that.\n\nTherefore, the third program's input is the first element of the second program's output, which is current_n (ans).\n\nThus, the third program's logic is to check if the string representation of current_n contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSince current_n is an integer, its string representation has no letters, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is \"No\".\n\nThus, the entire Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the first program's input, compute ans, then output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the problem's requirement, we must translate the entire sequence, so even if the second program's processing is redundant, we must perform it correctly.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is the output of the second program. The second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on their own line with a space and newline. The third program reads the first token (the first number), which is current_n. So the third program's input is the string representation of current_n, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the first program's input, compute ans, then output \"No\".\n\nBut to adhere to the problem's requirement of translating the entire sequence, even if some steps are redundant, we must model all steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's output is needed for the third program's input, but since the third program only reads the first token, we can just pass the first element (current_n) to the third program's logic.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nAfter computing ans (current_n):\n\nthird_input = current_n\n\nthird_output = \"No\" if the string of third_input doesn't contain 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThus, the final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, j, fl, ans, ansprice\n\n    integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vec\n\n    ! Read first program's input\n\n    read *, n\n\n    allocate(vec(n,4))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read *, vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute first program's answer\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    ansprice = 20000\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        fl = 1\n\n        do j = 1, n\n\n            if (j == i) cycle\n\n            if (vec(j,1) > vec(i,1) .and. vec(j,2) > vec(i,2) .and. vec(j,3) > vec(i,3)) then\n\n                fl = 0\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (fl == 1) then\n\n            if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n                ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n                ans = i\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, the second program's first output is ans (current_n)\n\n    ! Third program's input is the string of ans, so output \"No\"\n\n    print *, \"No\"\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the third program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the input is the string representation of ans (an integer), it can't have those letters, so output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final program can be as simple as that.\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So even if the second program's processing is redundant, we must perform it correctly. But in this case, the second program's processing only affects the third program's input, which is the first number of its output (ans). So the third program's input is ans as a string, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the above code is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the second program's output has more numbers, but the third program's input is the entire output? For example, if the second program's output is \"6 3 1\", then the third program's input is \"6 3 1\" (as a single string?), but in Java, the third program reads the first token, which is \"6\".\n\nIn Fortran, the third program's input is the entire output of the second program, but in the translated code, we have to process it as per the third program's logic.\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nSo in Fortran, the third program's input is the entire output of the second program (the list of numbers), but the code only reads the first token (the first number). So in the Fortran code, we can just take the first number (ans) and process it.\n\nTherefore, the code above is correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as written."
