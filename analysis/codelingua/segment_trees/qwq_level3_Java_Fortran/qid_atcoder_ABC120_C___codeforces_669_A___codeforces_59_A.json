Hmm, okay.

So for example, n=4: 4//3=1, mod1, so 1*2 +1=3. n=3: 1*2 +0=2. n=5: 1*2 +1=3. Wait, the code is (n/3)*2 + (if mod3==0 then 0 else 1). So the formula is (n div 3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 ! =0 else 0). So for n=5, 5//3 is 1, mod2, so 2+1=3. So the output is 2*(n//3) + (1 if n mod3 ! =0 else 0).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC120_C. It reads a string, processes it with a stack to count pairs of 0 and 1, and outputs the count multiplied by 2. The second file, codeforces_669_A, takes an integer n, computes (n//3)*2 + 1 if n mod 3 isn't zero, else 0. The third file, codeforces_59_A, checks a string's case and converts it to all upper or lower based on which is more, or lower if equal.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. Wait, but looking at the code:\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (c*2). The second program expects an integer n as input. So the first program's output is a number, which is the input to the second. The second program's output is another number, which is the input to the third? Wait, the third program expects a string (word). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, the third program's input is a word, but the second program's output is a number. So maybe the sequence is first to second, then second's output is input to third? But the third expects a string. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So first program's output is the input to the second, second's output to third. But the second program's input is an integer, so first's output must be a number. The third program's input is a string, so the second's output must be a string? Wait, the second program's output is a number, so the third program would read that as a string? Because the third program's input is a word (from in.next()), which is a string. So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the third program. So the third program will process that number as a string, counting uppercase vs lowercase letters. But numbers don't have uppercase or lowercase, so maybe the third program would treat them as lowercase? So the third program's output would be the same as the input string (since numbers are lowercase, so if the input is all digits, then uppercase count is zero, lowercase count is the length, so it would output lowercase). \n\nHmm, okay. So the sequence is:\n\nInput -> first program (output a number) -> second program (takes that number as input, outputs another number) -> third program (takes that second number as a string, outputs either all lowercase or uppercase of that string, but since numbers are lowercase, it would output the same as input, but maybe leading zeros? Not sure, but the code must be followed.\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The first program's input is read via Fortran's input, the second and third process without I/O, and the final output is the third's result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input (the first program's input) in Fortran.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (the stack-based counting of pairs).\n\n3. Take the result (c*2) and pass it to the second program's logic (compute (n//3)*2 + ...).\n\n4. Take that result and pass it to the third program's logic (check case and convert).\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nSo in Fortran, all steps must be done in memory, with only first reading input and last writing output.\n\nLet me break down each Java program into their functions.\n\nFirst program (TaskB):\n\n- Reads a string x.\n\n- Uses a stack to process each character. For each new character, push to stack. Then while stack has at least two elements, check top two. If they are 0 and 1 (in any order), pop both, increment count, and continue. Else, break and push back.\n\n- The count is multiplied by 2 and printed.\n\nSecond program (codeforces_669_A):\n\n- Reads an integer n, then computes (n divided by 3) * 2 plus 1 if remainder is non-zero, else 0. Wait, the code is (n//3)*2 + (if n mod3 ==0 then 0 else 1). So for example, n=4: 4//3=1, mod1, so 1*2 +1=3. n=3: 1*2 +0=2. n=5: 1*2 +1=3. Wait, the code is (n/3)*2 + (if mod3==0 then 0 else 1). So the formula is (n div 3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). So for n=5, 5//3 is 1, mod2, so 2+1=3. So the output is 2*(n//3) + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nThird program (codeforces_59_A):\n\n- Reads a string, counts uppercase and lowercase letters. Then converts to all lowercase if lowercase count is >= uppercase, else uppercase. So if equal, lowercase.\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to implement all three steps in sequence.\n\nFirst, read the input string (for the first program). Then process it through the first's logic, get the count*2 as an integer. Then pass that integer to the second's logic, compute the second's result (another integer). Then convert that integer to a string (since the third program expects a string input), process it through the third's logic, and output the result.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is an integer, which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a string, so the second's output must be converted to a string. So in Fortran, after computing the second's result (integer), we need to convert it to a string (character array) to pass to the third's processing.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string (for first program).\n\n2. Process first program's logic (the stack-based count):\n\n   - Initialize a stack (maybe using an array and a pointer).\n\n   - Iterate over each character in the input string.\n\n   - Push each character onto the stack.\n\n   - Then, while the stack has at least two elements:\n\n      - Pop two elements.\n\n      - If they are '0' and '1' in any order, increment count and continue.\n\n      - Else, push them back and break.\n\n   - After processing all characters, compute count *2.\n\n3. Take that result (integer) and compute the second program's output:\n\n   - Let n = first_result.\n\n   - Compute second_result = (n /3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0).\n\n4. Convert second_result to a string (character array).\n\n5. Process third program's logic on that string:\n\n   - Count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n   - Decide which case to output.\n\n6. Output the final string.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first program's stack. Since Fortran doesn't have a stack data structure, I can use an array with an index as the top.\n\nLet me outline variables:\n\nFor first program:\n\n- input_str: character array (string) read from input.\n\n- stack: array of characters, size say 1000 (since the input can be up to some length, but need to check constraints. But since Java code uses a Stack, which can grow, but in Fortran, we need to preallocate. Let's assume a large enough size, say 1e5 or so. Alternatively, use a dynamic array, but in Fortran, that's more complex. Alternatively, since the input is a string, perhaps the maximum stack size is the length of the string. So maybe stack size can be the length of the input string. But in code, perhaps better to use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, use an array with a size that's the length of the input string, since the stack can't be longer than that.\n\nWait, the stack processing in the first Java program: each character is pushed, and then pairs are popped when possible. The stack can't grow beyond the input length. So for the Fortran code, let's read the input string, get its length, then allocate a stack array of that length.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So perhaps first read the input string, then get its length, then allocate the stack array with that length. But in Fortran 90+, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead the input string (the first program's input is a single string, as per the first Java code's in.next() which reads the next token, but in the first Java code, the InputReader's next() reads the next token, but in the first program's solve method, it's x = in.next(); so the input is a single token (the entire string? Or maybe the input is a single line? The problem might be from AtCoder's problem C, which is \"Trick or Treat\", where the input is a string of 0s and 1s. So the input is a single string, so in Fortran, read it as a single line.\n\nWait, in the first Java program's InputReader's next() method, it reads tokens, but in the first program, the input is read as a single token (since it's x = in.next(); so the input is a single string, possibly with spaces? Or maybe the problem expects the entire input line as the string. Since the problem is about a string of 0s and 1s, probably the input is a single line with no spaces, so in Fortran, read the entire line as a string.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string using something like:\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut need to handle possible leading/trailing spaces? Probably not, as per problem constraints.\n\nThen, process the first program's logic.\n\nImplementing the stack:\n\nInitialize stack as an array of characters, with a top index starting at 0.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nLoop over each character in input_str:\n\n   push to stack (increment top, stack(top) = char)\n\n   then, while top >=1 (since need at least two elements):\n\n      pop two elements: a = stack(top), top = top-1; b = stack(top), top = top-1.\n\n      if (a == '0' and b == '1') or (a == '1' and b == '0'):\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          continue (so loop again to check again)\n\n      else:\n\n          push back b and a (since popped in reverse order?)\n\n          top = top +1; stack(top) = b\n\n          top = top +1; stack(top) = a\n\n          exit the while loop (since the pair can't be merged anymore)\n\nWait, in Java's code, after popping two elements, if they form a pair (0 and1), then count increases, and the loop continues (so check again the new top of stack). Else, push them back and break.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nAfter popping p and q (p is the top, then q is the next), so the order is p is the last popped, q is the one before. So when they form a pair, they are both removed, so the stack is now shorter by two. Then the loop continues, checking again if the new top has at least two elements.\n\nIf they don't form a pair, then push back q and p (since the order matters?), so the stack is restored to before the two pops, and then break the while loop.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\ns.pop() gives p (the top), then s.pop() gives q (the next one below p). So the order is p is the top, q is below. So when pushing back, they are pushed in the same order: first q, then p? Because when you push q then p, the stack will have p on top again. Because:\n\ns.push(q) then s.push(p) \u2192 the order is q then p, so the top is p again. So the stack is restored to the state before the two pops.\n\nYes, that's correct. So in Fortran, after popping a and b (a was the top, then b was the next), if they don't form a pair, we need to push back b then a, so that the stack is the same as before the two pops.\n\nSo in code:\n\nAfter popping a and b (a is first popped, then b):\n\nif they form a pair (a and b are 0 and1 in any order):\n\n   count +=1\n\n   continue the while loop (so check again the new top)\n\nelse:\n\n   push back b and a (so stack becomes ... b, a on top)\n\n   break the while loop.\n\nThus, in Fortran code:\n\nInitialize stack as a character array, say of size len_trim(input_str), and top starts at 0.\n\nThen for each character in input_str:\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = current_char\n\n   then, do while (top >=2):\n\n      a = stack(top)\n\n      top = top -1\n\n      b = stack(top)\n\n      top = top -1\n\n      if ( (a == '0' .and. b == '1') .or. (a == '1' .and. b == '0') ) then\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          ! continue the loop, so no action here except to loop again\n\n      else\n\n          ! push back b and a\n\n          top = top +1\n\n          stack(top) = b\n\n          top = top +1\n\n          stack(top) = a\n\n          exit do  ! break the while loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but in the else case, after pushing back, we exit the do loop (the while loop). Because once we can't merge those two, we stop checking further.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after pushing back and breaking, the while loop stops. So in Fortran, after pushing back, we exit the do loop (the while loop).\n\nWait, the do while loop in Fortran is a bit different. Wait, in Fortran, the loop structure would be:\n\ndo while (top >=2)\n\n   ... \n\n   if (condition) then\n\n      ... \n\n   else\n\n      ... \n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop condition is checked at the start. So after the else clause, we exit the loop, so the next iteration is not done.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code structure is okay.\n\nOnce all characters are processed, the first result is count *2.\n\nThen, the second program's logic:\n\nTake that first_result (integer), compute second_result as (first_result /3)*2 + (1 if mod(first_result,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with negative numbers, but since the first result is count*2, which is non-negative.\n\nSo:\n\nsecond_result = (first_result /3)*2\n\nif (mod(first_result,3) /=0) second_result = second_result +1\n\nThen, the third program's input is the string representation of second_result.\n\nSo need to convert second_result to a string. In Fortran, can use write to a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: second_str\n\nwrite(second_str, '(I0)') second_result\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces (since I0 writes without leading zeros, but may have leading spaces if the number is shorter than the field).\n\nAlternatively, use adjustl to left-adjust the string.\n\nThen, process the third program's logic on second_str.\n\nThird program's processing:\n\ncount_upper =0, count_lower=0\n\nloop over each character in second_str:\n\n   if the character is uppercase (A-Z), increment upper.\n\n   else if lowercase (a-z), increment lower.\n\n   else (digits, etc.), do nothing? Since the input is a number, which is digits, so all characters are lowercase (digits are considered lowercase? Well, in Fortran, the case of digits doesn't matter, but in the third program's code, digits are not uppercase or lowercase, so they are counted as lowercase? Because in Java, Character.isUpperCase would return false for digits, so they contribute to lowercase count.\n\nThus, in the third program's processing, any non-alphabetic characters (like digits) are treated as lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(second_str)\n\n   c = second_str(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      count_upper = count_upper +1\n\n   else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      count_lower = count_lower +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen decide which case to output:\n\nif count_upper > count_lower:\n\n   output the string in uppercase.\n\nelse:\n\n   output in lowercase.\n\nThus, the final output is the converted string.\n\nPutting all together in Fortran:\n\nNow, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen process first program's logic.\n\nThen compute second result.\n\nConvert to string.\n\nProcess third's logic.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: input_str\n\ninteger :: count, first_result, second_result\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: second_str\n\ninteger :: count_upper, count_lower\n\nBut in Fortran, allocatable variables need to be declared with a length, but for reading a line, perhaps better to use a fixed length, but since we don't know the input length, perhaps read into a large enough array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with a large size.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 2003, we can use a deferred-length allocatable character variable.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read a line of arbitrary length, you can use:\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut if input_str is a character variable with a fixed length, it might truncate. So better to use an allocatable variable.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003, you can do:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: input_str\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_str\n\nBut I'm not sure if all compilers support this. Alternatively, read into a large enough array.\n\nAlternatively, use a large fixed-length array.\n\nLet me proceed with a fixed-length array for simplicity, assuming the input is not too long.\n\nLet's set a maximum input length, say 1e5.\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: input_str\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_str\n\nThen, the actual length is len_trim(input_str).\n\nThen, process the first program's stack.\n\nInitialize stack array:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_stack = 100000\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: stack(max_stack)\n\ninteger :: top =0\n\ncount =0\n\nThen loop over each character in input_str:\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   current_char = input_str(i:i)\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = current_char\n\n   ! Now check the stack\n\n   do while (top >=2)\n\n      a = stack(top)\n\n      top = top -1\n\n      b = stack(top)\n\n      top = top -1\n\n      if ( (a == '0' .and. b == '1') .or. (a == '1' .and. b == '0') ) then\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          ! continue the loop, so no push back, and check again\n\n      else\n\n          ! push back b and a\n\n          top = top +1\n\n          stack(top) = b\n\n          top = top +1\n\n          stack(top) = a\n\n          exit  ! exit the do while loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but after popping a and b, if they form a pair, then we don't push them back, so the stack is now shorter by two. Then, the loop continues (the do while (top >=2)), so we check again the new top.\n\nWait, in the code above, after popping a and b, if they form a pair, then count increases, and the loop continues (the do while loop continues). Because the code is inside the do while loop, so after the if, the loop will check again the condition (top >=2). But after popping two elements, the top is now (previous top -2). So after processing the pair, the stack is shorter, so the next iteration of the do while loop will check again.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after the if (pair found), the code does not push anything back, so the stack is now two elements shorter. Then, the loop continues, so the do while loop will check again whether top >=2 (the new top after the pops). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after the if, the code just increments count and continues. The loop will then check the condition again. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the if, the code does not have an exit, so the loop continues. So the do while loop will check again the condition (top >=2) after the pops. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the do while loop is inside the main loop over each character. So for each character added to the stack, after pushing, we enter the do while loop to check and process pairs.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce all characters are processed, first_result = count *2.\n\nThen compute second_result:\n\nsecond_result = (first_result /3)*2\n\nif (mod(first_result,3) /=0) second_result = second_result +1\n\nThen convert second_result to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: second_str\n\nwrite(second_str, '(I0)') second_result\n\nsecond_str = adjustl(second_str)  ! remove leading spaces\n\nThen process third program's logic.\n\ncount_upper =0\n\ncount_lower =0\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(second_str)\n\n   c = second_str(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      count_upper = count_upper +1\n\n   else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      count_lower = count_lower +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen decide the output:\n\nif (count_upper > count_lower) then\n\n   output_str = uppercase(second_str)\n\nelse\n\n   output_str = lowercase(second_str)\n\nend if\n\nWait, how to convert to uppercase or lowercase in Fortran?\n\nFortran has functions for that:\n\noutput_str = adjustl(second_str)\n\nif (count_upper > count_lower) then\n\n   output_str = transfer(ichar(output_str) - 32, output_str)  ? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, Fortran has the functions char and ichar. To uppercase:\n\nEach character can be converted using:\n\nif (c >= 'a' and c <= 'z') then, c = char(ichar(c) -32)\n\nSimilarly for lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic functions:\n\noutput_str = uppercase(second_str)\n\nBut I think there's no built-in function, so need to loop.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic functions:\n\noutput_str = adjustl(second_str)\n\nif (count_upper > count_lower) then\n\n   do i =1, len_trim(output_str)\n\n      c = output_str(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n          output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) -32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   do i =1, len_trim(output_str)\n\n      c = output_str(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n          output_str(i:i) = char(ichar(c) +32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the second_str is the string of the second_result, which is a number, so all characters are digits (0-9), which are neither uppercase nor lowercase. So in the third program's processing, the count_upper will be 0, and count_lower will be the length of the string (since digits are not uppercase, so they are counted as lowercase? Wait, in the third Java program, the code counts lowercase as any non-uppercase. Because in Java, Character.isUpperCase returns false for digits, so they are added to lowercase count.\n\nThus, in the third program's processing, the count_upper is 0, count_lower is the length of the string (since all characters are digits, which are not uppercase). So the output will be the lowercase version of the string, which is the same as the original (since digits are already lowercase). So the final output is the same as the second_result's string.\n\nBut the code must still process it as per the third program's logic.\n\nThus, the code for the third part is okay.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nNow, the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=100000) :: input_str\n    integer :: count, first_result, second_result\n    character(len=20) :: second_str\n    integer :: count_upper, count_lower\n    character(len=20) :: output_str\n    integer :: i, top\n    character(len=1), dimension(100000) :: stack\n\n    !

(a == '1' .and. b == '0')) then\n                count = count + 1\n            else\n                top = top + 1\n                stack(top) = b\n                top = top + 1\n                stack(top) = a\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    first_result = count * 2\n\n    ! Process second program\n    second_result = (first_result / 3) * 2\n    if (mod(first_result, 3) /= 0) then\n        second_result = second_result + 1\n    end if\n\n    !

Output the result\n    print *, trim(output_str)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third program's processing, the second_str is the string of the second_result, which is a number, so all characters are digits. Thus, in the third processing, count_upper is 0, count_lower is the length. So the output_str will be the lowercase version of the digits, which is the same as the original. So the final output is the same as the second_result's string. But the code is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose first program's output is 0 \u2192 second_result is 0 \u2192 second_str is \"0\" \u2192 third program converts to lowercase (same as input). So output is \"0\".\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 5 \u2192 second_result is (5//3)*2 +1 \u2192 1*2+1=3 \u2192 second_str is \"3\" \u2192 output \"3\".\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 3 \u2192 second_result is (3/3)*2 +0 \u2192 2 \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 output \"2\".\n\nAnother case where first program's output is 4 \u2192 second_result is (4//3)*2 +1 \u2192 1*2+1=3 \u2192 \"3\".\n\nNow, the code should handle all these.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Stack size: The stack array is dimensioned as 100000. If the input is longer than that, it will overflow. But assuming the problem constraints allow that, or the input is within that limit.\n\n- The first program's loop over the input_str: the loop runs from 1 to len_trim(input_str), which is correct.\n\n- The stack processing: after pushing each character, the inner loop checks for possible pairs.\n\n- The second_result calculation: division and mod in Fortran are integer operations. For positive numbers, it's okay.\n\n- The conversion to string: using I0 format writes the number without leading blanks, but adjustl is used to remove any leading spaces.\n\n- The third program's case conversion: since the input is digits, the code does nothing, but the code is correct.\n\nThus, this should work."
