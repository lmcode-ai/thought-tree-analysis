    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_296_A) reads an integer n, then n integers. It counts the frequency of each number using an array of size 1001. Then it checks if the maximum frequency is within a certain limit based on n being even or odd. The output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. Wait, but in the sequence, the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which would be a string. But the second program expects a string input, which would be that \"YES\" or \"NO\" string? Wait, but the second program's input is from the first's output. Wait, but the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the second program would read that line, replace any commas with spaces, but \"YES\" and \"NO\" don't have commas. So the second program's output would be the same as the first's output. Hmm, but maybe the second program is part of the chain, so perhaps the first program's output is passed to the second, which then outputs the same string (since no commas to replace). Then the third program would take that output as input?\n\nWait, but the third program (atcoder_ABC124_C) reads a string, and counts the minimal number of changes needed to make adjacent characters different. Wait, but the input to the third program would be the output of the second, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Let's see: \"YES\" has 'Y', 'E', 'S'\u2014no adjacent duplicates. So the count would be 0. \"NO\" has 'N' and 'O', so also no duplicates. So the third program would output 0 in either case. But maybe I need to check the exact steps.\n\nWait, but the problem is to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's input is the user's input, then its output is the input to the second Java program, whose output is the input to the third, and the third's output is the final output. So the Fortran program must read the user's input, process it through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. First Java program: Read n and n numbers, compute max frequency, output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n2. Second Java program: Take that \"YES\"/\"NO\" string, replace commas with spaces (but there are none), so output same string.\n\n3. Third Java program: Take that string, process it as the input x. Then, count the minimal changes needed to make adjacent characters different. Since the input is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have no adjacent duplicates, the counts would be 0. So the third program's output is 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's take \"YES\" as input to the third program. The first part (a) starts with 'Y', then 'E' is different, then 'S' is different. So no changes needed. The a1 count is 0. The second part (b) processes from the end: same, so a2 is also 0. So the min is 0. Similarly for \"NO\": the first character is N, then O, so no changes needed. So the third program's output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the first program's output (as long as it's \"YES\" or \"NO\"). Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me re-express the steps:\n\nThe first program's input is the user's input. Its output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program takes that output as input, replaces commas with spaces (but there are none), so outputs the same string. The third program takes that string as input, and processes it. So the third program's input is the same as the first's output. So the third program's output is 0 in either case.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is then passed to the second program, which outputs the same, then to the third, which outputs 0. So the final output is 0. But perhaps the user's input is such that the first program's output is different? Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the first program's input is such that it outputs \"YES\". Then the second program outputs \"YES\", and the third outputs 0. If the first outputs \"NO\", same result. So the final output is always 0? That's strange. But perhaps the problem is that the second program is part of the chain, but in reality, the first program's output is a single line, so the second program's input is that line, and the third's input is the second's output. So the third program's input is the same as the first's output. So the third program's output is 0 in either case. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the first program's result. But that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is not part of the chain? Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with each output as next's input. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input, and third's output is the final output. So the third program's input is the second's output, which is the first's output with commas replaced by spaces. But since the first's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have no commas, the second's output is same as first's. So third's input is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is 0. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, but only if the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". Wait, but the first program's output is always \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the final output is 0. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the input to the first program. That's a bit strange, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express each program's purpose:\n\nFirst program (codeforces_296_A):\n\n- Reads n followed by n integers. Counts the frequency of each integer (indices 0-1000). The maximum frequency is found. Then, if n is even, check if max <= n/2. If n is odd, check if max <= (n//2)+1. Output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC051_A):\n\n- Reads a string (the first program's output), replaces commas with spaces, outputs the result.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC124_C):\n\n- Reads a string (the second's output, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\"), then counts the minimal number of changes to make adjacent characters different. Since the input has no adjacent duplicates, the count is 0. So the third program's output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 0, regardless of the input to the first program. But that's only if the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". Since the first program's output is always one of those two, the final output is 0.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"YES\". Then the second program outputs \"YES\", and the third program's input is \"YES\". The third program's code:\n\nThe string is \"YES\". The first loop (a) starts from index 1 (since i starts at 1). The first character is 'Y', next is 'E' (different, so no change). Then 'S' is different from 'E', so no changes. So a1 is 0. The second loop (b) goes backward. Starting from the end, check each pair. The last two are 'E' and 'S' (different), so no changes. The first two are 'Y' and 'E' (different). So a2 is also 0. The min is 0. So output is 0.\n\nSame for \"NO\": the two characters are different, so both a1 and a2 are 0. So yes, the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is always 0, regardless of the input to the first program. So the Fortran program must read the input (for the first program), process through all three steps, and output 0.\n\nWait, but that's a very specific result. But according to the problem statement, the user wants the Fortran program to behave identically to the original chain. So the Fortran program must read the input (for the first Java program), process through all three steps, and output the final result (0). So the Fortran program can be written to just read the input (the first program's input), ignore it, and output 0. But that's only if the first program's output is always \"YES\" or \"NO\", which it is. But maybe there's a case where the first program's output is different? Let me check the first program's code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the maximum frequency. The maximum frequency is the maximum count in the array. The condition is:\n\nif n is even: if countMax <= n/2 \u2192 YES else NO\n\nif n is odd: countMax <= (n/2)+1 \u2192 YES else NO\n\nSo the first program's output is always \"YES\" or \"NO\". Therefore, the third program's input is always a two or three-letter string with no commas, so the second program's output is same as first's, leading to third's output being 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is always 0. So the Fortran program can be written to read the input (for the first program), process it (but the result is irrelevant because the final output is always 0), but actually, the steps must be followed.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the Fortran program must reproduce the same behavior as the original chain. So even if the final output is always 0, the Fortran program must process the input through all three steps, even if the result is always 0. Because maybe there's a case where the first program's output is different, but according to the code, it can't be. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program replaces commas with spaces. Since the first's output has no commas, the second's output is same. The third program takes that string and processes it. The third program's code is:\n\nIt reads a string x. Then, in the first loop, it goes from 1 to x.length-1 (assuming 1-based?), and if the current character is same as previous, it changes it and increments a1. Wait, in Java, strings are 0-based. Let me check the third Java program's code:\n\nIn the third program's code:\n\nThe first loop is for (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nSo for \"YES\", which is length 3, i runs from 1 to 2 (indices 1 and 2 in 0-based terms). The first character is index 0 (Y), then index 1 (E), then 2 (S). So for i=1 (E), check if it's same as previous (Y). No, so no change. Then i=2 (S) vs previous (E). No change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nThe second loop is for (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) { ... }\n\nSo for \"YES\", starting at i=2 (S), then i=1 (E). For i=2, check with i-1 (E vs S? No. Then i=1 (E) vs 0 (Y): no. So a2 is 0. So min is 0.\n\nTherefore, the third program's output is 0. So the entire sequence's output is 0 regardless of the first program's input. Therefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input (for the first program), process it (but the result is irrelevant), and output 0. But the problem requires that the Fortran program must process the entire sequence correctly, even if the final result is always 0. So the steps must be followed.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (for the first Java program's input).\n\n2. Process the first step (count frequencies, decide YES/NO).\n\n3. Then process the second step (replace commas with spaces, but since the first's output has none, it's same).\n\n4. Then process the third step (count minimal changes, which is 0).\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to do all steps in one program, without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input (n and n integers).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (YES/NO as a string).\n\n- Then process the second step (replace commas with spaces in that string \u2192 same string).\n\n- Then process the third step (compute the minimal changes for that string \u2192 0).\n\n- Output the final result (0).\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input (n and n integers), compute the first step's output (YES/NO), then compute the third step's result (0), and output it.\n\nWait, but the second step's processing is redundant here, since it doesn't change the string. So the second step can be skipped in the code, but the third step's input is the first's output. So the Fortran program can ignore the second step's processing, since it doesn't affect the third step's input.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\nRead the input (n and n integers).\n\nCompute the first program's output (YES/NO).\n\nThen, process the third program's logic on that string (YES/NO), which will give 0.\n\nSo the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead n and the list of integers.\n\nCompute the frequency array.\n\nFind the maximum frequency.\n\nDetermine \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThen, take that string, process it through the third program's logic (count minimal changes).\n\nOutput the result (0).\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead n, then read n integers. Count frequencies in an array of size 1001 (since the indices can be up to 1000, as per the first Java program's array size).\n\nThen compute the maximum frequency.\n\nThen decide the first output string (YES/NO).\n\nThen, process that string through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's logic is:\n\nTake the string (e.g., \"YES\" or \"NO\"), and count the minimal changes needed to make adjacent characters different.\n\nThe third program's code does two passes:\n\nFirst pass (a1): iterate from left to right, changing the current character if it's same as previous, incrementing a1.\n\nSecond pass (a2): iterate from right to left, changing the previous character if same as current, incrementing a2.\n\nThen take the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nWait, in the third Java code:\n\nFor the first loop (a):\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        change the current character (i) to the opposite, then a1++\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the code, a is a StringBuilder of the original x. So for each i starting at 1, if current char is same as previous, then set it to the opposite (0 if 1, 1 if 0?), but the original string is x, which is the input. Wait, the third program's input is a string (the output of the second program, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\"). But in the third program's code, the input x is the string, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of '0's and '1's? Wait, looking at the third Java code:\n\nThe third program's code is from atcoder ABC124_C. Let me check the problem.\n\nThe third program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of 0s and 1s, and you have to find the minimal number of changes to make all adjacent characters different. But in the sequence here, the input to the third program is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters, not 0/1. So the third program's code would process those letters, but the code is designed for 0/1. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. The third Java program is expecting a string of 0s and 1s, but in the sequence, the input to the third program is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters. So the third program's code would process those letters, but the code's logic is for 0/1. So the code would have errors?\n\nWait, looking at the third Java code's code:\n\nThe third program's code is:\n\npublic void solve(...) {\n\n    String x = in.next();\n\n    StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder(x);\n\n    int a1 = 0;\n\n    for (int i=1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n        if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n            if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n\n            else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n\n            a1++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // similar for a2.\n\n}\n\nWait, so the code is designed for strings composed of '0's and '1's. But in our case, the input is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have characters like 'Y', 'E', 'S', 'N', 'O'. So when the code checks if the current character is '1', it would be false, so it would set it to '1'? That would be incorrect. So the third program's code would not work for the input \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, this is a problem. The third program is part of the sequence, but the input to it is not a 0/1 string. Therefore, the entire sequence's behavior is undefined here. But according to the problem statement, the user provided these three Java programs to be translated into a single Fortran program. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third program is not part of the sequence? Or perhaps the sequence is different. Wait, the user says the three Java programs are to be executed in sequence, with each output as next's input. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input. But the third program's code expects a 0/1 string, but the second's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters. So this is a problem. Therefore, the sequence as given is invalid, but the user wants us to proceed as per the code.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me re-examine the third Java program's code.\n\nLooking at the third Java program's code:\n\nThe third program is atcoder_ABC124_C. The problem for that is probably about a string of 0s and 1s, but in the sequence here, the input is \"YES\" or \"NO\". So the code would process those letters, but the code's logic is for 0/1. So the code would have errors. For example, in the first loop:\n\nSuppose the input is \"YES\".\n\nThe first character is 'Y', then 'E', then 'S'.\n\nAt i=1 (E), compare to previous (Y). They are different, so no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nAt i=2 (S), compare to previous (E). Different, so no change. So a1 is 0.\n\nThen the second loop (a2):\n\nProcessing from the end. Starting at i = 2 (S), then i=1 (E).\n\nFor i=2, compare with i-1 (E). Different, so no change.\n\nFor i=1 (E), compare with i-0 (Y). Different, so no change. So a2 is 0. The min is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nWait, but the code's logic for changing the characters is only when the current character is '1' or '0'. But in the case of 'Y', the code would check if it's '1', which it's not, so it would set it to '1'? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)), then:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == '1') \u2192 set to '0', else set to '1'.\n\nWait, but in the case of 'Y' and 'E', they are different, so the condition is not met. So the code doesn't change anything. So even though the characters are not 0/1, the code's logic doesn't affect them because the condition (equality) is not met. So the code would still work, because the count is based on whether adjacent characters are the same, regardless of their actual values. The code's changing part is only when they are same, but in the case of \"YES\", they are not same, so the code doesn't do anything. So the a1 and a2 counts remain 0. So the output is 0.\n\nAh, right! The code's logic for counting the number of changes is based on whether adjacent characters are the same. The actual characters' values (like 'Y' vs 'E') don't matter for the count, as long as they are different. The code's part where it changes the characters is just to compute the minimal steps, but in the case of \"YES\", since all are different, no changes are needed, so the counts are 0. So the third program's output is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the first program's input. So the Fortran program can be written to process all steps and output 0.\n\nNow, to write the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program: n followed by n integers.\n\n2. Compute the frequency array (array of size 1001, indices 0 to 1000).\n\n3. Find the maximum frequency.\n\n4. Determine \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the first program's logic.\n\n5. Take that string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and process it through the third program's logic (count minimal changes).\n\n6. Output the result (0).\n\nBut since steps 4 and 5 can be computed directly, perhaps we can skip some steps.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, we need to read n and then n integers. We can store them in an array.\n\nThen, count the frequencies. Since the indices can be up to 1000, we can have an array of size 1001 (indices 0 to 1000).\n\nThen find the maximum frequency.\n\nThen decide the first output string.\n\nThen, process that string through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's logic for the string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") will always return 0, so the final output is 0. But to be precise, we need to code that.\n\nWait, but let's code it properly.\n\nThe third step's processing:\n\nThe string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nFor \"YES\":\n\nLength is 3.\n\nFirst pass (a1):\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nY and E: different \u2192 no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nE and S: different \u2192 no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nSecond pass (a2):\n\nCheck from the end:\n\nS and E: different \u2192 no change.\n\nE and Y: different \u2192 no change. a2 remains 0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nFor \"NO\":\n\nLength 2.\n\nFirst pass: N and O \u2192 different \u2192 a1 0.\n\nSecond pass: same \u2192 a2 0. So min 0.\n\nThus, the third program's output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can just output 0 after processing the first step, but to be precise, we need to follow all steps.\n\nBut the problem requires that the Fortran program must behave identically, so even if the final result is always 0, the code must process all steps correctly.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nRead n and the list of integers.\n\nCompute frequency array.\n\nFind max frequency.\n\nCompute the first output string (YES/NO).\n\nThen process that string through the third program's logic.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, coding in Fortran:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, i, num, max_freq, a1, a2, result\n\ninteger, dimension(0:1000) :: freq\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: first_output\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: s\n\nThen, read n:\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate an array to hold the numbers? Or just process them as they come.\n\nWait, in Fortran, perhaps read n, then read n integers, and for each, increment the frequency array.\n\nSo:\n\nread*, n\n\nfreq = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read*, num\n\n    freq(num) = freq(num) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen find the maximum frequency:\n\nmax_freq = maxval(freq(1:1000))  (since indices 0 to 1000, but the first element (0) might not be used, but the problem's first Java code starts from i=1 in the array loop.)\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the loop for finding max is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) \u2192 since array is size 1001, indices 0 to 1000. So the loop starts at 1 (i=1 to 1000). So in Fortran, the max is over freq(1:1000).\n\nmax_freq = maxval(freq(1:1000))\n\nThen decide the first output:\n\nif (mod(n,2) == 0) then\n\n    if (max_freq <= n/2) then\n\n        first_output = \"YES\"\n\n    else\n\n        first_output = \"NO\"\n\n    end if\n\nelse\n\n    if (max_freq <= (n/2) + 1) then\n\n        first_output = \"YES\"\n\n    else\n\n        first_output = \"NO\"\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nThen, process the first_output through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's logic is:\n\nTake the string s (first_output), compute a1 and a2.\n\nFirst, a1:\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)  (since in Fortran, strings are 1-based)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == s(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        a1 = a1 + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Wait the third program's code for a1 is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        a1++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So for a string of length L, the loop runs from i=1 to L-1 (since i < L). So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=2 to len_trim(s), since Fortran is 1-based.\n\nWait, for a string of length m, the indices are 1 to m. So for i from 2 to m:\n\nif s(i) == s(i-1), then increment a1.\n\nWait, but the code in the third program also changes the character, but since in our case, the characters are all different, the count is just the number of adjacent duplicates. But the code's a1 counts the number of changes needed when processing left to right, changing the current character when duplicates are found. However, in our case, there are no duplicates, so a1 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly for a2.\n\nThus, the code for a1 and a2 can be simplified to count the number of adjacent duplicates, but in our case, it's zero.\n\nBut to code it properly:\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == s(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        a1 = a1 + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the third program's code actually changes the characters, but since in our case there are no duplicates, the count is the same as the number of duplicates. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe third program's code for a1:\n\nThe code counts the number of changes made when processing left to right. Each time two adjacent characters are the same, the current character is flipped, so that they are different. Each such flip counts as a change. The total a1 is the number of such flips needed.\n\nBut in the case of \"YES\", there are no duplicates, so a1 is 0.\n\nSimilarly for a2.\n\nThus, the code for a1 and a2 can be written as:\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i) == s(i-1)) then\n\n        a1 = a1 + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the actual code in Java does more than just count the duplicates. It actually modifies the string, but in the case of no duplicates, the count is the same as the number of duplicates. Because each duplicate requires a change, and each change fixes it. So the count is exactly the number of duplicates.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"0011\".\n\nProcessing left to right:\n\ni=1 (0 and 0 \u2192 same \u2192 change to 1 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 now string is \"0111\".\n\ni=2 (1 and 1 \u2192 same \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 \"0101\".\n\ni=3 (0 and 1 \u2192 no change.\n\nTotal a1 is 2.\n\nThe number of duplicates in the original string is 3 (the two 0s and two 1s). But the count is 2. So the count is not the same as the number of duplicates. So my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nAh, right. The count is the number of changes needed, which may be less than the number of duplicates. So the code must be implemented as per the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, to compute a1 and a2 correctly, we need to simulate the process.\n\nSo for a1:\n\nWe need to track the previous character as we go, and count each time a change is made.\n\nInitialize a1 =0.\n\nprev_char = s(1:1)\n\nThen for i from 2 to len_trim(s):\n\ncurrent_char = s(i:i)\n\nif current_char == prev_char:\n\n    a1 +=1\n\n    if current_char == '1' then new_char = '0' else '1'\n\n    prev_char = new_char\n\nelse:\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nWait, but in the code, the current character is changed, so the next comparison uses the new character.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThe first loop processes the string as a StringBuilder. So for each i from 1 to length-1 (Java's 0-based):\n\nif current char (i) equals previous (i-1):\n\n    change current to opposite, increment a1.\n\nThus, the next comparison (i+1) will see the changed character.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nprev_char = s(1)\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i =2 to len_trim(s):\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if current_char == prev_char:\n\n        a1 +=1\n\n        if current_char == '1' then new_char = '0' else '1'\n\n        current_char = new_char\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nThus, the code must track the previous character after each change.\n\nSimilarly for a2, which processes from the end.\n\nFor a2:\n\nWe process from the end towards the start.\n\nprev_char = s(len_trim(s))\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s)-1 downto 1:\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if current_char == prev_char:\n\n        a2 +=1\n\n        if current_char == '1' then new_char = '0' else '1'\n\n        current_char = new_char\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the third program's code for a2:\n\nThe loop is for (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--):\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        change the previous character (i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\n    }\n\nWait, in the code for a2:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to '0' else '1'\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the code changes the previous character (i-1) instead of the current. So the processing is different.\n\nWait, in the code for a2:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i-1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i-1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo when a duplicate is found between i and i-1, the previous character (i-1) is changed, not the current (i). So the next iteration will see the changed character.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm for a2 is:\n\nprev_char = s(len_trim(s))\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s)-1 downto 1:\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if current_char == prev_char:\n\n        a2 +=1\n\n        if current_char == '1' then new_char = '0' else '1'\n\n        current_char = new_char\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the code for a2:\n\nThe loop starts at i = length-1 (Java's 0-based, so for a string of length m, the last index is m-1. So in Fortran's 1-based, the last index is m. So the loop in Fortran would be from i = m downto 2 (since i>0 in Java's terms).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to code this step by step.\n\nLet me think in terms of the string s (e.g., \"YES\").\n\nProcessing a1:\n\nStart with the first character 'Y'.\n\ni=2 (second character 'E'):\n\nCompare with previous 'Y' \u2192 different \u2192 no change. prev_char is 'E'.\n\ni=3 (third character 'S'):\n\nCompare with 'E' \u2192 different \u2192 no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nThus, a1 is 0.\n\nProcessing a2:\n\nStart with the last character 'S'.\n\nprev_char = 'S'\n\ni starts at 2 (second character 'E'):\n\nCompare with previous (i=2's next is i+1? Wait, perhaps I need to track it properly.\n\nWait, in the a2 loop:\n\nThe loop in Java is for (i from length-1 downto 1):\n\nWait, in Java, for a string of length m (indices 0 to m-1), the loop runs i from m-1 downto 1.\n\nIn Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so for a string of length m, the loop would be from i = m downto 2.\n\nAt each step i (current position), we check if the current character (i) is same as previous (i-1).\n\nWait, no. The code for a2 is checking if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, change the previous (i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\nWait, the code for a2 is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        // change the previous character (i-1)\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran terms, for a string s of length m:\n\nprev_char = s(m)\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = m-1 downto 1:\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if current_char == prev_char:\n\n        a2 +=1\n\n        if current_char == '1' then new_char = '0' else '1'\n\n        current_char = new_char\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Let me think step by step for a2:\n\nInitialize prev_char as the last character (s(m)).\n\nThen, for i from m-1 down to 1:\n\ncurrent_char is s(i).\n\nCompare current_char with prev_char (which is the next character in the original string).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track the previous character as we go backward.\n\nWait, let's take the example of \"YES\" (characters Y, E, S):\n\nProcessing a2:\n\nStart with prev_char = S (the last character).\n\nThen i = 2 (E):\n\ncurrent_char is E.\n\nCompare with prev_char (S) \u2192 different \u2192 no change. prev_char becomes E.\n\nThen i=1 (Y):\n\ncurrent_char is Y.\n\nCompare with prev_char (E) \u2192 different \u2192 no change. prev_char becomes Y.\n\nThus, a2 remains 0.\n\nAnother example: \"NO\" (N, O):\n\nprev_char = O.\n\ni=1 (N):\n\nCompare N and O \u2192 different \u2192 no change. a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, the code for a2 also gives 0.\n\nTherefore, the code for a1 and a2 can be written as follows in Fortran:\n\nFirst, for a1:\n\nprev_char = s(1:1)\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n    current_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == prev_char) then\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n        if (current_char == '1') then\n\n            current_char = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            current_char = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code, after changing current_char, the next iteration uses the new current_char as the next prev_char. So this is correct.\n\nFor a2:\n\nprev_char = s(len_trim(s):len_trim(s))\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s)-1, 1, -1\n\n    current_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == prev_char) then\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n        if (current_char == '1') then\n\n            current_char = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            current_char = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the a2 code, the change is made to the previous character (i-1), but in the code above, we are changing the current character. Wait, no. The code for a2 in Java changes the previous character (i-1), but in the Fortran code above, I'm changing the current character. That's a mistake.\n\nWait, in the a2 code:\n\nThe code in Java is:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') \u2192 set to '0'\n\n    else \u2192 set to '1'\n\n    a2++;\n\n}\n\nSo the code changes the character at position i-1 (the previous one), not the current i.\n\nTherefore, in the a2 loop, when a duplicate is found between i and i-1, the previous character (i-1) is changed, not the current (i).\n\nTherefore, the algorithm for a2 is:\n\nprev_char is the current character at position i-1 after the change.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track the previous character as we go backward.\n\nLet me think of the a2 processing for \"0011\" (Java's 0-based indices 0,1,2,3):\n\nOriginal string: 0 0 1 1\n\nProcessing from i=3 downto 1:\n\ni=3 (Java's index 3 is the fourth character, which is '1'):\n\nCheck with i-1 (index 2, '1') \u2192 same. So change the previous (i-1=2) to '0', a2 becomes 1.\n\nNow the string becomes 0 0 0 1.\n\nThen i=2 (index 2 is now '0'):\n\nCompare with i-1 (index 1, '0') \u2192 same. Change index 1 to '1', a2 becomes 2.\n\nString is now 0 1 0 1.\n\ni=1 (index 1 is now '1'):\n\nCompare with i-0 (index 0, '0') \u2192 different. No change.\n\nThus, a2 is 2.\n\nThe minimal is min(2, 2) \u2192 2.\n\nBut the correct minimal changes for \"0011\" is 2 (changing the second 0 to 1 and the third 1 to 0).\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, in the a2 loop, when a duplicate is found between current (i) and previous (i-1), we change the previous (i-1) character, so the next iteration will see the changed character.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the a2 loop must track the previous character as the one before the current position, but the change is made to the previous character (i-1), so the next step will see the updated previous character.\n\nWait, in Fortran's terms, for a string s of length m:\n\nprev_char is initially s(m).\n\nThen, for i from m-1 down to 1:\n\ncurrent_char is s(i).\n\nCompare current_char with prev_char (which is the next character in the original string).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nprev_char is the next character (i+1) in the original string, but since we're going backward, it's better to track the previous character as we go.\n\nWait, let me try to code it properly.\n\nInitialize prev_char as the last character (s(m)).\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = m-1 downto 1:\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if (current_char == prev_char) then\n\n        a2 +=1\n\n        if (current_char == '1') then\n\n            new_char = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            new_char = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        prev_char = new_char\n\n    else\n\n        prev_char = current_char\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, this way, after changing, the next iteration's prev_char is the new character.\n\nWait, let's see with the example \"0011\" (Fortran indices 1-4):\n\nInitial prev_char = s(4) = '1'\n\ni=3 (current_char = s(3) = '1'):\n\ncurrent_char == prev_char (1 ==1 \u2192 yes).\n\na2 +=1 \u2192 1.\n\nnew_char is '0'.\n\nprev_char becomes '0'.\n\ni=2 (current_char = s(2) = '0'):\n\nCompare with prev_char (0) \u2192 same.\n\na2 +=1 \u2192 2.\n\nnew_char is '1'.\n\nprev_char becomes '1'.\n\ni=1 (current_char = s(1) = '0'):\n\nCompare with prev_char (1) \u2192 different.\n\nprev_char becomes '0'.\n\nThus, a2 is 2, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code for a2 is:\n\nprev_char = s(len_trim(s):len_trim(s))\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s)-1, 1, -1\n\n    current_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == prev_char) then\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n        if (current_char == '1') then\n\n            new_char = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            new_char = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        prev_char = new_char\n\n    else\n\n        prev_char = current_char\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThus, the code for a1 and a2 can be written as above.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, num, max_freq, a1, a2, result\n\n    integer, dimension(0:1000) :: freq\n\n    character(len=4) :: first_output\n\n    character(len=4) :: s\n\n    !

So the code is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the example where first_output is \"YES\":\n\na1:\n\nprev_char starts as 'Y'.\n\ni=2 (E):\n\nE vs Y \u2192 no change. prev_char is E.\n\ni=3 (S):\n\nS vs E \u2192 no change. a1 remains 0.\n\na2:\n\nprev_char starts as 'S'.\n\ni=2 (E):\n\nE vs S \u2192 no change. prev_char is E.\n\ni=1 (Y):\n\nY vs E \u2192 no change. a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, result is 0.\n\nAnother test case: first_output is \"NO\".\n\na1:\n\nprev_char 'N'.\n\ni=2 (O) \u2192 no change. a1 0.\n\na2:\n\nprev_char 'O'.\n\ni=1 (N) \u2192 no change. a2 0.\n\nResult 0.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nTherefore, this Fortran program should correctly replicate the sequence of the three Java programs."
