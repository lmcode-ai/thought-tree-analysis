    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file, codeforces_222_A. It reads integers n and k, then a sequence of n integers. It tracks consecutive duplicates. The variable 'c' counts the current streak of the same number. If the current number is the same as the last (l), c increments; else, it resets to 1. After processing all numbers, it checks if adding k to the current streak (c) exceeds n. If so, output n - c; else, -1. Wait, actually, the condition is if c + k > n, then print n - c, else -1. Hmm, maybe that's checking if the maximum possible streak plus k can reach beyond n? Not sure, but the code is straightforward.\n\nThe second Java file, codeforces_669_A, takes an integer n and computes (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder when divided by 3. So for example, if n is 4, 4/3 is 1 with remainder 1, so 1*2 +1 =3. Wait, the formula is (n//3)*2 + (if n mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0). So the output is 2*(n div 3) + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). So for n=5, 5/3 is 1, remainder 2, so 2 +1=3. Wait, the code says (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1). Wait, in Java, integer division is truncating, so 5/3 is 1. So 1*2 +1 (since 5%3 is 2 !=0) gives 3. So the output is that.\n\nThird Java file, atcoder_ABC132_A: It reads a string s, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the string must be of length 4, with two pairs. For example, \"aabb\" would be yes, \"abba\" yes, but \"abca\" would have a with 2, b with 1, c with 1, so no. The code uses a HashMap to count each character's occurrences. Then checks if all counts are exactly 2 and there are exactly two keys.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these three programs. The output of the first is input to the second, and the output of the second to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? Let me think. The first program's output is the result of its print statement. The second program's input is the first's output. The second's output is then the input to the third. The third's output is the final result.\n\nWait, but each program's input is from the previous program's output. So the first program reads from stdin (user input), then outputs a number. The second program takes that number as its input (so the second's input is that number). The second's output is another number, which is the input to the third program. The third program reads that number as a string? Wait, no. Wait the third program expects a string input. Wait, the third program's input is a string, but the second program's output is a number. So the second's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the third program, which expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the third program's first line is \"Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); String s = in.next();\". So it reads a single token from input, which is a string. But the second program's output is a number. So the third program's input is that number as a string. So for example, if the second program outputs \"3\", then the third program reads \"3\" as the string s, which would have characters '3', but then the check would fail because it's length 1, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output is a number (from its print statement), which is the input to the second program. The second program takes that number as its input (since it reads n via BufferedReader reading a line, which is the first program's output). Then the second program's output is another number, which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a string, so the input to it is that number as a string. So for example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program reads \"5\" as the string s, which is length 1, so it would output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but that might be the case. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a number. So the third program's input is that number as a string. So the third program's logic would check if that string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. For example, if the second program outputs \"22\", then the third would process \"22\" and see two '2's, but only one character, so it would output \"No\". If the second outputs \"12\", then the string is \"12\", which has two characters each once, so again \"No\". Only if the second's output is a 4-character string with two pairs, like \"1122\", then it would output \"Yes\".\n\nWait, but the second program's output is a number. So the output is a number, which when converted to a string, must be a 4-character string with two pairs. For example, if the second program outputs 1122, then the third would process \"1122\" and output \"Yes\". But the second program's output is computed as (n/3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). Let's see for example, if the first program's output is 4, then the second program would compute (4/3)=1, so 1*2 +1 (since 4 mod3 is 1) \u2192 3. So the third program would get \"3\" as input, which is length 1 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem is that the sequence is such that the first program's output is the input to the second, which is a number, then the second's output is a number, which is the input to the third, which expects a string. So the third program's input is the second's output as a string. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second's output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, I need to process the three steps in sequence, passing data between them without I/O except first and last.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the input for the first program (the first Java's input), process all three steps, and output the third program's result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, k, then n integers).\n\n2. Process the first Java's logic to compute its output (the first's print statement).\n\n3. Take that output as input to the second Java's logic (so the second's input is that number, which is the first's output).\n\n4. Process the second's logic to compute its output (the second's print statement).\n\n5. Take that output as input to the third Java's logic (so the third's input is the string representation of the second's output).\n\n6. Process the third's logic and output the result.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the entire process must be done in memory, with no intermediate I/O except the first read and the final write.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's input is: first two integers n and k, then n integers. So in Fortran, we need to read these from stdin.\n\nThen, compute the first's result (the first's output). Let's call this result1.\n\nThen, compute the second's result (result2) using result1 as input.\n\nThen, compute the third's result (result3) using the string representation of result2 as input.\n\nFinally, print result3.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n, k, then n integers into an array.\n\nCompute result1 as per first Java's logic.\n\nCompute result2 as per second Java's logic (result2 = (result1 // 3)*2 + (if mod(result1,3) ==0 then 0 else 1)).\n\nThen, process the third's logic with the string of result2.\n\nThe third's logic requires that the input is a string s. So we need to convert result2 to a string, then check if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo, in Fortran, steps for third part:\n\n- Convert result2 to a string s.\n\n- Check if the length of s is 4? Wait, no. The third program's condition is that the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly two times. So the length must be 4, but the code in Java doesn't check that. Wait, the code in the third Java program does not check the length. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the third Java code:\n\nThe code counts the occurrences of each character in the string s. Then, it checks if all counts are exactly 2, and the map's size is 2. So the total length is 2*2=4. So the string must be of length 4. But the code does not explicitly check the length. So if the input is a string of length not 4, then the counts would not sum to 4, so the counts would not all be 2. For example, if the input is \"123\", then counts are 1,1,1 \u2192 each count is not 2 \u2192 so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, in the third step, the string must be exactly four characters with two pairs.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the third part are:\n\nTake the string representation of result2 (as a string, e.g., \"1234\" or \"5\" or \"22\").\n\nCheck if the length is 4? Well, the code doesn't, but the logic requires that the total counts sum to 4. So the code's logic will automatically handle that.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the third part:\n\n- Convert result2 to a string s.\n\n- Count the occurrences of each character in s.\n\n- Check if all counts are exactly 2 and there are exactly two distinct characters.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java codeforces_222_A):\n\nVariables:\n\nn, k are input.\n\nThen, an array a of n integers.\n\nInitialize l = 0, c =1.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nInitially, l is 0, but the first a is read. Let's see:\n\nLoop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\na = in.nextInt();\n\nif a == l \u2192 c +=1 else c=1.\n\nThen l = a.\n\nWait, the initial l is 0. So for the first element, if a is 0, then c becomes 2? Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose first a is 5. Then since 5 != 0 (initial l), c is set to 1, then l becomes 5.\n\nWait, the code's initial c is 1. Wait, the code starts with l=0, c=1. Then in the first iteration, a is the first number. So if a is equal to l (0), then c becomes 2. Else, c is set to 1. Then l is set to a.\n\nWait, but the first a is the first element. So for example, if the first a is 0, then c becomes 2. But the initial l was 0, so yes. But if the first a is not 0, then c is set to 1, and l becomes that a.\n\nWait, but the initial c is 1. So for the first element, if a is not equal to l (0), then c is set to 1 (so same as before?), but then l is set to a. Hmm, perhaps the initial c is 1 is a mistake? Let me think.\n\nWait, the code's variables are initialized as l=0, c=1. Then, for the first a (i=0):\n\nif a == l (0), then c +=1 \u2192 becomes 2. Else, c=1. Then l is set to a.\n\nWait, but the first element's previous value (l) is 0, which may not be part of the input. So perhaps the initial c is 1 is incorrect. Wait, maybe the code is wrong? Or maybe the initial c is 1 is okay because the first element's check is against l=0, which is not part of the input. Hmm, but the code is as written, so we have to replicate it exactly.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the first part:\n\nRead n, k, then the array of n integers.\n\nInitialize l = 0, c =1.\n\nThen loop over each element in the array:\n\ncurrent a is the element.\n\nif a == l \u2192 c +=1 else c =1.\n\nThen set l = a.\n\nWait, but the first element's previous l is 0. So if the first element is 0, then c becomes 2. Else, c is set to 1.\n\nAfter processing all elements, compute the output:\n\nif (c +k) > n \u2192 output n -c else -1.\n\nWait, the code's condition is if (c +k) >n \u2192 print n -c else -1.\n\nWait, that's the first program's output.\n\nSo in Fortran, after processing the array, compute that.\n\nNow, the second part is straightforward: take the first's output (result1) and compute result2 = (result1 /3)*2 + (1 if mod(result1,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with negative numbers, but since n is input as per first program, which is a positive integer (since it's the number of elements), so result1 is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo result2 = (result1 /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(result1,3)/=0).\n\nThird part: take result2, convert to a string s. Then check the counts.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: result2 = 123\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result2\n\ntrim(s) to get the actual string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing to a character variable, you have to be careful with the length. Alternatively, use an internal write.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to convert integer to string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the steps:\n\nresult2 is an integer. Let's say it's stored in variable res2.\n\nWe need to convert res2 to a string s. Let's do:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res2\n\nThen, the actual string is s, but leading spaces may be present. Wait, no, the I0 format writes the number without leading spaces. Wait, the I0 format writes the integer in the smallest possible field. So the s will have the digits, but the rest of the characters in the array will be spaces. So we need to process only the actual characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of sufficient length, then trim it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a loop to count the digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, the best way is to use a character variable and then process each character in the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nOnce s is the string representation of res2, then we need to count the occurrences of each character.\n\nWe can use an array to count the frequency of each character.\n\nInitialize an array, say, count(256) = 0 (assuming ASCII). But in Fortran, characters can be handled as integers via ichar.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need to count the characters in the string s, we can loop through each character in s, and track their counts.\n\nFirst, get the length of s. The length can be found by finding the first position where the character is a space (assuming the rest are spaces). Alternatively, use the len_trim function.\n\nWait, len_trim(s) gives the length of the string without trailing spaces. So that's perfect.\n\nSo:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nThen, create an array to count each character's occurrence.\n\nWe can use a derived type or a hash map, but in Fortran, perhaps an array of size 256 (for ASCII) is easier.\n\nInitialize an array counts(0:255) = 0.\n\nThen loop over each character in s (only up to len_s):\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   ich = ichar(c)\n\n   counts(ich) = counts(ich) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, check two conditions:\n\n1. All non-zero counts are exactly 2.\n\n2. The number of non-zero counts is exactly 2.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, collect the counts and check.\n\nAlternatively, loop through the counts array to see if exactly two entries have count 2, and others zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps better to:\n\n- collect the unique characters and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, first check that the total length is 4 (since 2 characters each appearing twice \u2192 total 4). Wait, but the code in Java doesn't check the length, but the logic requires that the sum of counts is 4. So in Fortran, the code can proceed as:\n\nif (len_s /=4) then \u2192 then the answer is \"No\".\n\nWait, but the Java code doesn't check that. Let me see the third Java code again.\n\nThe third Java code's logic is:\n\n- For each entry in the map, check if the count is 2. If any is not, set ok to false.\n\n- Then, check if ok is true and the map's size is 2.\n\nSo the total length is 2*2=4, but the code doesn't explicitly check the length. So if the input is \"123\", the counts are 1,1,1 \u2192 so the ok becomes false, so the output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code can proceed without checking the length, as the counts will naturally not meet the conditions unless the length is 4.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter counting the characters:\n\nInitialize a flag ok = .true.\n\nnumber_of_chars = 0\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n      if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n          ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n      number_of_chars = number_of_chars +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (ok .and. (number_of_chars ==2)) then\n\n   result3 = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n   result3 = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but need to make sure that all counts are exactly 2 and exactly two characters.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, collect the counts into a list and check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to track the counts as we go.\n\nAlternatively, let's code it step by step.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n, k, then n integers into an array.\n\n2. Process the first part to get result1.\n\n3. Compute result2 from result1.\n\n4. Convert result2 to a string s.\n\n5. Process the third part to get result3.\n\n6. Print result3.\n\nNow, let's code each part.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, k, a(n), l, c, result1, result2\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\nlogical :: ok\n\ninteger :: counts(0:255) = 0\n\ninteger :: number_of_chars, ich, len_s\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array a needs to be dynamic. Since in the first Java code, n is read first, so in Fortran, we can read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can't have an array with a size determined at runtime unless you use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and k first, then allocate the array a.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, l, c, result1, result2\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\nlogical :: ok\n\ninteger :: counts(0:255) = 0\n\ninteger :: number_of_chars, ich, len_s\n\n! Read first part's input\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read*, a(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Process first part\n\nl = 0\n\nc =1\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (a(i) == l) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   end if\n\n   l = a(i)\n\nend do\n\nif (c +k >n) then\n\n   result1 = n -c\n\nelse\n\n   result1 = -1\n\nend if\n\n! Process second part\n\nresult2 = (result1 /3)*2\n\nif (mod(result1,3) /=0) then\n\n   result2 = result2 +1\n\nend if\n\n! Process third part\n\n! Convert result2 to string s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result2\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncounts = 0\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n   ich = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n   counts(ich) = counts(ich) +1\n\nend do\n\nok = .true.\n\nnumber_of_chars =0\n\ndo i=0,255\n\n   if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n      if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n         ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n      number_of_chars = number_of_chars +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (ok .and. (number_of_chars ==2)) then\n\n   print*, \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n   print*, \"No\"\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(a)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check the first part's loop again. The loop over the array a.\n\nWait in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++), so the first element is a[0], but in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So the code is correct.\n\nWait in the first part's processing:\n\nInitially, l is 0, c is 1.\n\nThen for each a(i) in a(1) to a(n):\n\nif a(i) == l \u2192 c +=1 else c=1.\n\nThen set l = a(i).\n\nWait, the first element:\n\nSuppose a(1) is 5. Then since 5 !=0 (l was 0), c becomes 1, then l is set to 5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThe code for the first part seems okay.\n\nThe second part's calculation:\n\nresult2 = (result1 /3)*2 + (1 if mod !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, mod(result1,3) gives the remainder. So if mod is not zero, add 1.\n\nYes, the code does that.\n\nThird part:\n\nThe string conversion is done via write(s, '(I0)') result2. The s is then processed.\n\nThe counts are initialized to zero, then for each character in the string (only up to len_s), we get the ichar and increment counts.\n\nThen, check all counts are 2 and exactly two characters.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The character array counts is size 0:255. That's okay for ASCII.\n\n- The string s may have leading spaces? No, because I0 format writes the number without leading spaces. The rest of the characters in the array are spaces, but len_trim(s) gives the actual length.\n\nWait, for example, if result2 is 123, then s would be '123' followed by spaces. The len_trim(s) is 3, so the loop runs from 1 to 3, processing the '1','2','3'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when the code computes result1, if c +k exceeds n, then result1 is n -c. Else -1.\n\nWait, the Java code's first program's output is:\n\nif (c +k >n) \u2192 print n -c else -1.\n\nWait, the condition is c +k >n \u2192 then output n -c?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose c is the current maximum consecutive count. The code's logic is to see if adding k to that count would exceed n. If so, then the required is n -c (since you can remove n -c elements to make it fit?), but I'm not sure. Anyway, the code is as written, so the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nYes, the code in the first part is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part, the counts are for all characters in the string, including possible spaces? No, because len_s is the length of the trimmed string, so the loop only goes up to len_s, which is the actual characters of the number.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nLet me think of a test case.\n\nSuppose first program's input is:\n\nn=5, k=3, and the sequence is 1 1 2 2 2.\n\nProcessing first program:\n\nThe sequence is 1,1,2,2,2.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nStart with l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst element 1: not equal to 0 \u2192 c=1, l=1.\n\nSecond element 1: equal to l (1) \u2192 c becomes 2, l=1.\n\nThird element 2: not equal \u2192 c=1, l=2.\n\nFourth element 2: equal \u2192 c=2, l=2.\n\nFifth element 2: equal \u2192 c=3, l=2.\n\nAfter processing, c is 3.\n\nCheck if 3 +3 (k=3) >5 \u2192 6>5 \u2192 yes. So result1 =5-3=2.\n\nSecond program takes 2 as input.\n\nSecond program's result2 is (2/3)*2 + (mod(2,3)!=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 add 1). So (0)*2 +1 \u21921.\n\nThird program's input is the string \"1\".\n\nThe string length is 1. The counts for '1' is 1. So the counts are not 2, so output \"No\".\n\nThus, the final output is \"No\".\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\nn=4, k=1, sequence 2 2 2 2.\n\nProcessing first program:\n\nThe sequence is 2,2,2,2.\n\nInitial l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst element 2: not equal to 0 \u2192 c=1, l=2.\n\nSecond element 2: equal \u2192 c=2, l=2.\n\nThird element 2 \u2192 c=3, l=2.\n\nFourth element 2 \u2192 c=4.\n\nCheck c +k =4+1=5>4 \u2192 yes. So result1 =4-4=0.\n\nSecond program's input is 0 \u2192 result2 = (0/3)*2 +0 \u21920.\n\nThird program's input is \"0\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where third outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSuppose first program's output is 22 \u2192 then second program's input is 22 \u2192 second program's result2 is (22/3)=7 \u2192 7*2=14, mod(22,3)=1 \u2192 so 14+1=15. So the third program's input is \"15\" \u2192 which is two characters, each appearing once \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nHmm, not good. Let's think of a case where the third outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSuppose first program's output is 21 \u2192 then second program's result2 is (21/3)*2 \u21927*2=14. mod(21,3)=0 \u2192 so 14. So third's input is \"14\" \u2192 two characters, each once \u2192 \"No\".\n\nHmm, need a case where the second's output is a 4-digit number with two pairs.\n\nSuppose first program's output is 12 \u2192 second program's result2 is (12/3)*2 \u21924*2=8 \u2192 mod 0 \u2192 so 8 \u2192 third's input is \"8\" \u2192 no.\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 1122 \u2192 but that's not possible because first program's output is an integer. Wait, the first program's output is either n-c or -1. Let's see.\n\nSuppose first program's output is 12 \u2192 second program's result2 is (12/3)*2 \u2192 8 \u2192 third's input is \"8\" \u2192 no.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output must be such that the second's output is a 4-digit number with two pairs. Let's see:\n\nSuppose second's output is 1122 \u2192 but that would require the first's output to be such that (n/3)*2 + (mod !=0 ?1:0) = 1122 \u2192 but that's a big number. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first's output is 1682 \u2192 1682 /3 is 560.666 \u2192 560*3 = 1680 \u2192 mod is 2 \u2192 so (560)*2 +1 \u2192 1121 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of second's output being 1212 \u2192 which is four digits with two 1's and two 2's.\n\nTo get 1212 as the second's output:\n\nresult2 =1212 \u2192 so:\n\nresult2 = (result1//3)*2 + (mod !=0 ?1:0) \u2192 1212 = ?\n\nLet me compute result1 such that:\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose result1 is 1817 \u2192 1817 /3 is 605.666 \u2192 605*3 = 1815 \u2192 mod 2 \u2192 so (605)*2 +1 = 1211 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's hard to find a test case where the third outputs \"Yes\", but the code should handle it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of a case where the second's output is 1122 \u2192 but that would require:\n\nresult2 = 1122 \u2192 so:\n\nresult2 = (result1//3)*2 + (mod !=0 ?1:0) \u2192 1122 = ?\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose result1 is 1682 \u2192 1682 /3 is 560.666 \u2192 560*3 = 1680 \u2192 mod 2 \u2192 so (560)*2 +1 = 1121 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the code as written, since the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother test case for the third part:\n\nSuppose the second's output is 12 \u2192 then the third's input is \"12\" \u2192 two characters, each once \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nIf second's output is 11 \u2192 then the string is \"11\" \u2192 two '1's \u2192 counts are 2 for '1', but only one character \u2192 so map size is 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nIf second's output is 1212 \u2192 then the string is \"1212\" \u2192 counts for '1' is 2, '2' is 2 \u2192 so yes.\n\nThus, the code would output \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
