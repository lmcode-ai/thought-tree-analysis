    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_612_B) reads an integer n, then reads n integers, and stores their indices in an array dp. Then it calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements' indices. The output is this sum. But since this is the first in the sequence, its output is the input for the next program. Wait, but the second program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, not a number. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's to the third. But the first program outputs a number, which would be the input to the second, which expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual flow again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then used as input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with each's output as the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output. But looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is a long (the ans variable). The second program reads a string from input. So the first program's output must be a string that the second program can read as its input. Wait, but the first program's output is a number. So the second program would read that number as a string? But the second program is expecting a string input (like a word or something). That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is not the correct input for the second. Maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sequence? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, but the second program is expecting a string. That would be a problem. Wait, perhaps the actual sequence is different. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, looking at the three Java files:\n\nFirst program (codeforces_612_B) reads n, then n integers, and outputs a number (the sum). The second program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string (from input) and outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\". The third program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs that. \n\nSo the sequence would be: the first program's output (a number) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. That can't be right. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's printing a number. So maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input string to the second program. For example, if the first program outputs \"42\", then the second program would read \"42\" as the input string, and process it. Then the second program's output (like \"First\") is the input to the third program, which would replace commas (but there are none) and output the same string. \n\nSo the final output would be the same as the second program's output. Wait, but the third program's job is to replace commas with spaces. So if the second program's output is \"First\", then the third program would output \"First\" (since there are no commas). \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is the same as the second program's output, but only if the third program's input has no commas. But perhaps the third program is part of the sequence, so even if the input has no commas, it still outputs the same string. \n\nSo the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program that does the same steps. The first program's input is read via the first block, then the second and third process without I/O, and the last outputs the result. \n\nNow, how to structure this in Fortran. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nRead n, then n integers. Then create an array dp where dp[i] is the index (0-based) of the i-th input number. Wait, no, the code does:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    dp[s.nextInt()] = i;\n}\n\nWait, the input after n is n numbers. Let me see: the first input is n, then the next n numbers are the elements. The dp array is of size 200001, which probably corresponds to the possible values of the elements. For each element (the next n numbers), the code is storing their index (i) in dp at the position equal to the element's value. So for example, if the first element after n is 5, then dp[5] = 0. The next element is 3, so dp[3] = 1, etc. \n\nThen, the ans is the sum from i=2 to n of |dp[i] - dp[i-1]|. Wait, but the loop is for i from 2 to n, inclusive? Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++). Since n is the number of elements, the elements are from 1 to n? Or maybe the elements can be up to 200000? The problem might be from a programming competition, so perhaps the elements are 1-based? Let me think. The problem's first code is for Codeforces problem 612B. Looking up that problem, it's \"Vasya and Socks\". The problem says that Vasya has n pairs of socks, each pair is a color. Each day he picks a sock from a pair, and after n days, he has one sock left. The problem requires to find the minimal number of days between the two socks of the same color. Wait, perhaps the code is solving that problem. The code's approach is to track the indices where each color appears, then compute the sum of differences between consecutive indices. Wait, maybe the problem is to compute the total distance between consecutive occurrences. Hmm, perhaps the code is correct for that problem. \n\nAnyway, the first program's output is the sum of absolute differences between the indices of consecutive numbers. The numbers are the elements read after n. \n\nThe second program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, counts the frequency of each character. Then counts how many characters have an odd count. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's even but more than 1, then the first player wins? Wait, the code says:\n\nif (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n} else {\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n}\n\nWait, the condition is: if oddCount is <=1 OR oddCount is odd (since %2 !=0). So if oddCount is even and greater than 1, then \"Second\". \n\nThe third program (atcoder problem ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces commas with spaces, then outputs it. \n\nNow, the sequence is first's output is the input to the second, which expects a string. So the first program's output is a number (the sum), which is passed as the input string to the second program. The second program will process that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"42\", then the second reads \"42\" as the input string. Then the second program counts the characters (digits '4' and '2'), their frequencies. Since both are even (each appears once?), wait no, each appears once. So oddCount would be 2 (since both '4' and '2' have counts 1, which are odd). Then since oddCount is 2 (even and >1), the second program would output \"Second\". Then the third program takes \"Second\" as input, replaces commas (none) and outputs \"Second\".\n\nSo the final output is \"Second\" in this example. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program (n and the n numbers), compute the sum, then use that sum as the input string for the second program's processing, then process that result through the third program's logic, and output the final result.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Fortran. The key is to have all steps in one program, with only the first reading input, the last writing output, and the middle steps processing data in memory.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program):\n\nRead n, then n integers. Then create an array dp (size 200001, but in Fortran, perhaps an array of size 200001, but since in Java it's 200001, maybe the elements can be up to 200000? Wait, the problem's first code uses dp[i], where i is up to n. Wait, the elements are the numbers read after n. So the elements can be up to n? Or maybe they can be any integers, but the array is sized 200001 to cover possible values. So in Fortran, perhaps an array of size 200001, initialized to zero. \n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is initialized as new int[200001], so indices from 0 to 200000. The code loops over the n elements, and for each element x (from s.nextInt()), it sets dp[x] = i. So the elements must be between 0 and 200000? Or perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that. \n\nIn Fortran, we can have an array of integers, say dp(0:200000), initialized to zero. Then, for each of the n elements (after reading n), we read the value x, and set dp(x) = i (the index, starting from 0). \n\nThen compute the sum ans as the sum from i=2 to n of |dp(i) - dp(i-1)|. Wait, but in the code, the loop is for i from 2 to n (inclusive). Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++). So the loop runs for i=2,3,...,n. \n\nWait, but the elements are from 1 to n? Or maybe the elements can be any numbers, but the problem's constraints ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once? Because otherwise, the code might have some undefined behavior. Looking at the problem 612B, the problem says that Vasya has n pairs of socks, each pair has a color. Each day he picks one sock from a pair. So the input is n followed by 2n numbers (since each pair has two socks). Wait, no, the problem's input is n followed by 2n numbers? Wait, the code's first program's code reads n, then n numbers. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the first Java code's first program's code:\n\npublic class codeforces_612_B {\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = s.nextInt();\n        int dp[] = new int[200001];\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            dp[s.nextInt()] = i;\n        }\n        long ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            ans += Math.abs(dp[i] - dp[i - 1]);\n        }\n        System.out.println(ans);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the problem's input is n followed by n numbers? But according to the problem statement for 612B, the input is n followed by 2n numbers. Because each pair has two socks, so 2n numbers. So perhaps the code is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the problem's input is n followed by n numbers, each representing the color of a sock. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Let me check the problem 612B.\n\nLooking up Codeforces problem 612B: \"Vasya and Socks\". The problem statement says:\n\nVasya has n pairs of socks. Each pair consists of two socks of color ci. Every morning he picks exactly one sock from each pair. In the evening he puts them into a basket. The next morning he takes all the socks from the basket and puts them on, but if there is an odd number of socks of some color, he leaves one sock of that color in the basket. The process continues until there are no socks left in the basket. Find the minimal possible number of days he can wear the socks.\n\nWait, the input is n followed by n integers c1, c2, ..., cn, where each ci is the color of the i-th pair. So each pair contributes two socks of color ci. So the total socks are 2n. \n\nThe code's approach is to track for each color, the indices where they appear. Since each color ci appears exactly twice (since each pair contributes two socks), the dp array for color ci will have two entries: the first occurrence's index and the second's. \n\nThe code's loop for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) reads the next integer (the color of the i-th pair), and stores the index i in dp[color]. Wait, but each color is read once per pair, but each pair has two socks. So the code is storing the index of the first occurrence of each color. Wait, no, because for each pair, the color is read once, but the two socks are in the same pair. So the code's approach is to track the first occurrence of each color. Then, for each color, the two socks are at positions i and ...? Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires to track the positions of each sock's color. Wait, perhaps the code is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code reads n, then reads n numbers (the colors of the pairs). Each pair's color is read once, but each pair has two socks. So the code's dp array is storing the index (i) of the first occurrence of each color. Then, for each color, the two socks are at positions i and ...? Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem's input is different. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the problem's input is n followed by 2n numbers (each sock's color). But in the code, it's reading n numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct for the problem. Let me see the code's logic. The problem requires to find the minimal number of days. The code computes the sum of the differences between the indices of consecutive occurrences of each color. Wait, perhaps the code is calculating the total distance between the two socks of each color, and summing all those. But how does that relate to the minimal days?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's solution is to arrange the socks in such a way that the two socks of the same color are as far apart as possible, so that their contribution to the total days is minimized. Wait, perhaps the code is actually calculating the total distance between the two socks of each color, and the minimal days is the sum of those distances divided by 2 or something. \n\nBut regardless, the code's output is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive indices for each color. Wait, the code loops from i=2 to n, and adds |dp[i] - dp[i-1]|. Wait, but the colors can be up to 200000, but the loop is up to n. So perhaps the colors are numbered from 1 to n, and each color appears exactly twice. So the loop is from 2 to n, but that would only cover colors up to n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's colors are numbered from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice. So the code's approach is correct. \n\nIn any case, the first program's output is a number, which is the sum. \n\nNow, moving to the second program (codeforces_276_B). It reads a string, counts the frequency of each character, then counts how many have odd counts. The output is \"First\" or \"Second\" based on the condition. \n\nThe third program (atcoder problem) takes a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. \n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nInput for first program \u2192 first's output (number) \u2192 second's input (as a string) \u2192 second's output (text) \u2192 third's input \u2192 third's output (with commas replaced by spaces).\n\nThe final output is the third's output. \n\nNow, to translate this into a single Fortran program. \n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n followed by n integers). \n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the sum ans). \n\n3. Convert that sum to a string (since it's the input to the second program). \n\n4. Process that string through the second program's logic (count character frequencies, determine \"First\" or \"Second\"). \n\n5. Take the result of the second program (the string \"First\" or \"Second\") and process it through the third program's logic (replace commas with spaces). \n\n6. Output the final string. \n\nNow, let's think about each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst step: Read n and the n integers. \n\nIn Fortran, we can read from standard input. So:\n\nRead *, n\n\nThen read n integers into an array. Let's say:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: colors\n\nallocate(colors(n))\n\nread *, colors(1:n)\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1, and for each, reads a number x, then sets dp[x] = i. So in Fortran, the colors array would be the list of the n numbers. \n\nThen, the dp array in Fortran would be an array of size 200001 (since in Java it's 200001 elements, indices 0 to 200000). So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:200000) :: dp = 0\n\nThen, loop over each color in colors array:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    x = colors(i)\n    dp(x) = i-1  ! since in Java, i starts at 0, so here i is 1-based, so subtract 1\nend do\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < n; i++), so the index i starts at 0. In Fortran, the loop variable i here is 1-based (from 1 to n), so the index stored in dp would be i-1. \n\nThen, compute the sum ans. The loop in Java is for i from 2 to n (inclusive). Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++). But in the problem's context, the colors are from 1 to n? Or maybe the colors can be up to 200000. \n\nWait, the code's dp array is of size 200001, so the maximum color value is 200000. The loop in Java is for i from 2 to n. Wait, but if the colors can be up to 200000, then the loop's upper limit is n, but that might not cover all colors. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, in the problem's context, each color is read exactly twice (since each pair contributes two socks). So the colors are from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice. Therefore, the loop in Java is from 2 to n, but that would only cover colors up to n. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem's colors are numbered from 1 to n, so each color is between 1 and n, and each appears exactly twice. Therefore, the loop in the first program's code is correct. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the loop for the sum would be:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + abs(dp(i) - dp(i-1))\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is from 2 to n (inclusive). So in Fortran, the loop is from 2 to n. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++), so yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the first part is done. \n\nNext, convert the ans (a long in Java, so in Fortran, perhaps an integer*8 or integer(8)) to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, to convert a number to a string, we can use write with an internal file or a character variable. \n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str1\nwrite(str1, '(I0)') ans\nstr1 = adjustl(str1)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, this str1 is the input to the second program. \n\nSecond program's processing:\n\nThe second program reads a string, counts the frequency of each character. \n\nIn Fortran, we can process the string str1. \n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character. Since characters can be any, but in Fortran, we can use a hash map-like structure. However, Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map. So perhaps we can use an array for ASCII characters. \n\nAssuming that the characters are ASCII, we can have an array of size 256 (for all possible ASCII characters). \n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: char_count = 0\n\nThen, loop over each character in str1:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str1)\n    c = ichar(str1(i:i))\n    char_count(c) = char_count(c) + 1\nend do\n\nThen, count how many have odd counts:\n\ninteger :: oddCount = 0\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n    if (mod(char_count(i), 2) == 1) then\n        oddCount = oddCount + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, determine the output string (second_result):\n\nif (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) == 1) then\n    second_result = \"First\"\nelse\n    second_result = \"Second\"\nend if\n\nThird program's processing:\n\nTake the second_result string and replace commas with spaces. \n\nIn Fortran, we can loop through each character and replace commas:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: third_result\nthird_result = second_result  ! assuming second_result is up to 6 characters (like \"Second\")\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(third_result)\n    if (third_result(i:i) == ',') then\n        third_result(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the third Java program, the input is read as a string (the second program's output), then the commas are replaced with spaces. \n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC051_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        String a = br.readLine();\n        sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n        System.out.println(sb);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line (the input string), replaces all commas with spaces, and outputs it. \n\nIn our case, the input to the third program is the second program's output, which is either \"First\" or \"Second\". Neither of these contain commas, so the output would be the same. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the third step is redundant, but we still have to perform it. \n\nThus, the third step is to process the second_result string, replacing commas with spaces. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: third_result\nthird_result = second_result\nwhere (third_result == ',') third_result = ' '  ! Not sure if this works, maybe better to loop.\n\nAlternatively, loop through each character:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(third_result)\n    if (third_result(i:i) == ',') then\n        third_result(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\n\nFinally, output third_result. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read n and the n integers (first part)\n- Compute the sum (ans)\n- Convert ans to a string (str1)\n- Process str1 through the second program's logic to get second_result\n- Process second_result through the third program's logic to get third_result\n- Print third_result\n\nNow, handling the variables:\n\nWe need to make sure all variables are properly declared. Let's outline the steps with variable declarations.\n\nFirst, the first part variables:\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: colors\ninteger :: i, x\ninteger(8) :: ans\ninteger, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n\nThen, read n and colors:\n\nread *, n\nallocate(colors(n))\nread *, colors(1:n)\n\nInitialize dp to zero:\n\ndp = 0\n\nThen loop over colors to fill dp:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    x = colors(i)\n    dp(x) = i-1\nend do\n\nCompute ans:\n\nans = 0\ndo i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + abs(dp(i) - dp(i-1))\nend do\n\nNow, convert ans to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str1\nwrite(str1, '(I0)') ans\nstr1 = adjustl(str1)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\nSecond part variables:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: char_count = 0\ninteger :: oddCount = 0\ncharacter(len=10) :: second_result\n\nProcess str1:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str1)\n    c = ichar(str1(i:i))\n    char_count(c) = char_count(c) + 1\nend do\n\nThen count odd counts:\n\noddCount = 0\ndo i = 0, 255\n    if (mod(char_count(i),2) == 1) then\n        oddCount = oddCount + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nDetermine second_result:\n\nif (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) == 1) then\n    second_result = \"First\"\nelse\n    second_result = \"Second\"\nend if\n\nThird part variables:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: third_result\n\nProcess second_result:\n\nthird_result = second_result\ndo i = 1, len_trim(third_result)\n    if (third_result(i:i) == ',') then\n        third_result(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\n\nFinally, print third_result:\n\nprint *, trim(third_result)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using print *, it adds a newline. The third Java program uses System.out.println, which also adds a newline. So that's okay. \n\nNow, putting all together in code:\n\nBut need to make sure the variables are declared properly. Also, note that in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with the dimension(0:...).\n\nWait, in the dp array, we have dimension(0:200000), which is okay. \n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program starts with:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, x\n    integer(8) :: ans\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: colors\n    integer, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n    character(len=20) :: str1\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: char_count\n    integer :: oddCount\n    character(len=10) :: second_result, third_result\n\n    ! First part: read input and compute ans\n    read *, n\n    allocate(colors(n))\n    read *, colors(1:n)\n\n    dp = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        x = colors(i)\n        dp(x) = i - 1\n    end do\n\n    ans = 0\n    do i = 2, n\n        ans = ans + abs(dp(i) - dp(i-1))\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert ans to string\n    write(str1, '(I0)') ans\n    str1 = adjustl(str1)\n\n    ! Second part: process the string\n    char_count = 0\n    do i = 1, len_trim(str1)\n        char_count(ichar(str1(i:i))) = char_count(ichar(str1(i:i))) + 1\n    end do\n\n    oddCount = 0\n    do i = 0, 255\n        if (mod(char_count(i), 2) == 1) then\n            oddCount = oddCount + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount, 2) == 1) then\n        second_result = \"First\"\n    else\n        second_result = \"Second\"\n    end if\n\n    ! Third part: replace commas with spaces\n    third_result = second_result\n    do i = 1, len_trim(third_result)\n        if (third_result(i:i) == ',') then\n            third_result(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output\n    print *, trim(third_result)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part, when accessing char_count, the index is the ASCII code. So for each character in str1, we get its ASCII code with ichar, then increment that index in char_count. \n\nYes. \n\nTesting this code with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 42. Then str1 is \"42\".\n\nProcessing the second part:\n\nThe characters are '4' (ASCII 52) and '2' (ASCII 50). \n\nchar_count(52) = 1, char_count(50) =1. \n\noddCount is 2 (both counts are odd). \n\nSince 2 is even and >1, second_result is \"Second\".\n\nThird part: \"Second\" has no commas, so third_result is \"Second\".\n\nThus, the output is \"Second\".\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 3 (ans=3). \n\nstr1 is \"3\".\n\nCharacters: '3' (ASCII 51). \n\nchar_count(51)=1 \u2192 oddCount=1. \n\nCondition: oddCount <=1 \u2192 yes. So second_result is \"First\". \n\nThird step: no commas \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs 0 \u2192 str1 is \"0\". \n\nchar_count(48)=1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs 123 \u2192 str1 is \"123\". \n\nCharacters '1', '2', '3' \u2192 counts 1 each \u2192 oddCount=3 (which is odd). \n\nThus, condition is met (oddCount is odd \u2192 mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 yes \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs 111 \u2192 str1 is \"111\". \n\nCharacters '1' appears 3 times \u2192 count for '1' is 3 (odd), others 0. \n\noddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs 1234 \u2192 str1 is \"1234\". \n\nEach character appears once \u2192 4 characters, each count 1 \u2192 oddCount=4 (even and >1 \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nThus, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The dp array in Fortran is 0:200000. The colors array can have values up to 200000. But in the problem's context, the colors are up to n, but in the code, the first program's code uses dp[i], where i is up to n. Wait, in the first program's code, the loop for the ans is from 2 to n, so the indices i go up to n. So the colors must be up to n. But in the code, the dp array is 200001 elements, so it can handle up to 200000. \n\nBut in the problem's context, the colors are from 1 to n (since each pair's color is given as an integer, and there are n pairs). So the maximum color is n, so the dp array's size is sufficient. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when reading the colors, if the input has more than n numbers, but the code reads exactly n. \n\nBut according to the problem's first program's code, it reads exactly n numbers after n. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the first program's code, the loop for the ans is from 2 to n, but the colors may not be contiguous. For example, if the colors are 1,3,2, then the loop would process i=2 and 3. \n\nWait, the loop is for i from 2 to n. So if the colors are 1,3,2 (n=3), then the loop runs for i=2 and 3. \n\nFor i=2: dp[2] is the index where 2 was first found (which is 2 (third element, index 2 in 0-based)), and dp[1] is 0. So the difference is 2-0 = 2. \n\nFor i=3: dp[3] is 1 (second element, index 1), dp[2] is 2 \u2192 difference is 1-2 = -1 \u2192 absolute is 1. \n\nTotal ans is 2+1=3. \n\nBut according to the problem's logic, the sum of the differences between consecutive indices for each color. Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but that's beyond our concern here. \n\nThe code must replicate the Java's behavior, so the Fortran code must do exactly what the Java code does. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the first program's code, the dp array is initialized to zero. So for colors not present in the input, dp[i] remains zero. But in the problem's context, each color is present exactly twice, so all colors from 1 to n are present. \n\nThus, the code should be okay. \n\nNow, the Fortran code should be written as above. \n\nWait, in the second part, the char_count array is initialized to zero before processing. \n\nYes, in the code, after the first part, we set char_count = 0 before the loop. \n\nAlso, in the third part, the third_result is initialized to second_result, then commas are replaced. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the final code in Fortran."
