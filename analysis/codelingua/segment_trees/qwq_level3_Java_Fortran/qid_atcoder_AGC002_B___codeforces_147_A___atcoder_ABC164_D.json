Then the third program would take that output as input, but the third program expects a string S (like a number string?), but the third program's input is a single string, which would be \"5\" in this case. But the third program's logic is about counting substrings mod 2019. So perhaps the sequence is possible, but the first program's output is an integer, which is passed as a string to the second, then the second's output (modified string) is passed to the third.

Wait, the code's logic is that when moving marbles, if the current box has red = true, then the other box's red is set to true. But the current's red is only set to false when the current's num was 1 (so moving the last marble, which was red). Otherwise, when moving a marble from a box with red = true (and num >1), the other box's red is set to true, but the current's red remains true. So the red marble is considered to be in both boxes?

So no adjustment needed except that the array is 1-based. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nSuppose in Java, the user inputs x=1 and y=2. Then in Java, x becomes 0, y becomes 1 (since subtract 1).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_AGC002_B) reads N and M, then processes M moves between boxes. The boxes have a count of marbles and a flag for the red marble. The output is the number of boxes with the red marble. The second file (codeforces_147_A) processes a string, adding spaces before letters if the previous character isn't a letter, and keeps punctuation. The third (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, calculates some modulo counts for 2019, and outputs the number of pairs with the same mod.\n\nThe key is to chain them so the output of the first is input to the second, then the second's output to the third. But in Fortran, I have to do this without I/O in the middle. So the first program's output (the counter) becomes the input to the second, but wait, no\u2014the second program's input is a string. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, but the second expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each is input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second requires a string input. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misread the Java code.\n\nWait, looking again: The first Java program's output is the counter (an integer). The second program's input is a string (from System.in). So how does that connect? Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the first program, the output is an integer. So perhaps the sequence is not the first to second to third, but maybe the first is run, then the second, then the third, each taking input from the previous's output. But the first outputs an integer, which the second expects a string. That can't be. So maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps the actual sequence is different. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second's input is a string. So perhaps the first program's output is a string? Wait, no, the first program's output is System.out.println(counter), which is an integer. So that can't be the input to the second program, which reads a line of text. So perhaps the sequence is not the first to second to third, but maybe the first and third are separate? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the three Java files are meant to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are not directly connected. Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the first outputs an integer, which the second expects a string. That's a conflict. Hmm, maybe I need to check the code again.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program (codeforces_147_A), it reads a line from stdin (s = br.readLine()), which is a string. The first program's output is an integer. So unless the first program's output is a string, but in the first program, it's printing an integer. So the first program's output is a number, which the second program would read as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read \"5\" as the input string. Then the second program processes that string, perhaps adding spaces before letters if needed. But \"5\" is a single character, so the second program would output \"5\" (since it's not a letter or punctuation). Then the third program would take that output as input, but the third program expects a string S (like a number string?), but the third program's input is a single string, which would be \"5\" in this case. But the third program's logic is about counting substrings mod 2019. So perhaps the sequence is possible, but the first program's output is an integer, which is passed as a string to the second, then the second's output (modified string) is passed to the third. \n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result of the third program. \n\nThe challenge is to combine all three into a single Fortran program, with only the first part reading input, the last part writing output, and the middle parts processing without I/O.\n\nLet me break down each Java program's functionality and see how to translate them into Fortran steps.\n\nFirst Java program (File 1):\n\n- Reads N and M from input.\n- Initializes N boxes. The first box has 1 marble and red is true. The rest have 1 marble but red is false.\n- Then, for M moves: each move takes x and y (0-based?), and moves from x to y. The move method in Box has some logic:\n   - If the current box has 0 marbles, do nothing.\n   - If it has 1 marble: move it to the other box. The red flag is transferred if it was red.\n   - If it has more than 1: decrease by 1, increase the other by 1, and if red was true, the other's red becomes true.\n- After all moves, count how many boxes have red = true.\n\nSecond Java program (File 2):\n\n- Reads a string s from input.\n- Processes it by adding a space before a letter if the previous character is not a letter. Also keeps punctuation.\n- The first character is added as is. Then for each next character:\n   - If it's a letter, check previous character. If previous is not a letter, add a space before it.\n   - Punctuation is added as is.\n- The output is the processed string.\n\nThird Java program (File 3):\n\n- Reads a string S.\n- Computes the number of substrings (non-overlapping?) that form numbers divisible by 2019. The approach uses modular arithmetic and counts the number of pairs with the same mod.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence, with the first step's output feeding into the second, then the second's into the third.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables can be passed between sections. So the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) will process N and M, compute the count (counter), then that count is used as the input to the second part (the second Java program's processing). Wait, but the second program expects a string. So the first program's output (counter) is an integer, which must be converted to a string to be the input for the second part. Then the second part processes that string, producing another string, which is then the input to the third part.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string S. So the second program's output (the processed string) is the input to the third program. The third program then processes that string and outputs the final count.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read N and M from input (first program's input).\n2. Process the boxes and compute the counter (first program's output).\n3. Convert counter to a string (since second program's input is a string).\n4. Process that string with the second program's logic, resulting in a new string.\n5. Take that string and process it with the third program's logic, outputting the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read N and M (from the user's input).\n- Compute the counter (from first Java program).\n- Convert that counter to a string (so that it can be the input to the second step).\n- Process that string through the second program's logic (adding spaces as needed).\n- Take the resulting string and process it through the third program's logic (modular arithmetic for 2019).\n- Finally, output the result of the third program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (Java's first program):\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- N and M (integers).\n- An array of boxes. Each box has a number of marbles (num) and a red flag (logical).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So need to adjust for that.\n\nThe Box class has a moveTo method. Let's see how to model this in Fortran.\n\nThe Box structure can be represented as an array of structures. Let's define a type for Box:\n\ntype box_type\n    integer :: num\n    logical :: red\nend type box_type\n\nThen, the boxes array would be boxes(1:N). The first box (index 1) starts with num=1, red=.true. The rest (indices 2 to N) start with num=1, red=.false.\n\nThen, for each move (M times), read x and y (but in Java, they are 0-based, so in Fortran, we need to add 1 to convert to 1-based indices? Wait, the Java code subtracts 1 from x and y, so the input x and y are 1-based in the input, but stored as 0-based in the array. Wait, in the Java code, the input x and y are read as sc.nextInt(), then subtract 1 to make them 0-based indices. So in Fortran, when reading the input, the x and y would be 1-based (since the user inputs 1-based?), but in the code, they are converted to 0-based. Wait, no, in the Java code, the user inputs x and y (probably 1-based?), then subtract 1 to get 0-based indices for the array. So in Fortran, when reading the input, the x and y are 1-based, so we can subtract 1 to get 0-based indices (but in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so perhaps better to adjust to 1-based indices).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So the first box is index 1. So in the Java code, the first box is index 0. So when translating, the Java's x and y (after subtracting 1) would correspond to Fortran's indices (x+1 and y+1?), no. Wait, let me think:\n\nJava's Box array is 0-based (indices 0 to N-1). The first box (index 0) is initialized with 1 marble and red. The input x and y are given as 1-based (since the user inputs numbers from 1 to N?), so when the Java code subtracts 1, they become 0-based indices. So in Fortran, the input x and y are 1-based, so in Fortran, the indices would be x and y (no need to subtract 1, since the array is 1-based). Wait, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the first element is 1. So the Java's 0-based index 0 is Fortran's 1. So when the Java code reads x and y (user inputs 1-based?), subtracts 1 to get 0-based, so in Fortran, the user inputs x and y (same as Java's input), and we can use them directly as indices (since Fortran is 1-based). So no adjustment needed except that the array is 1-based.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nSuppose in Java, the user inputs x=1 and y=2. Then in Java, x becomes 0, y becomes 1 (since subtract 1). The move is from box 0 to 1. In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices would be 1 and 2. So the user's input x and y are 1-based, so in Fortran, we can use them directly as indices. So no need to adjust. So the code for the first part would read N and M, then read M pairs of x and y (as integers), then process each move.\n\nThe move function's logic:\n\nThe Box's moveTo method in Java has three cases:\n\nCase 1: if current box's num is 0, do nothing.\n\nCase 2: if num is 1:\n\n- set current num to 0.\n\n- other's num increases by 1.\n\n- if current was red, set other's red to true, and current's red to false.\n\nCase 3: if num >1:\n\n- decrease current num by 1.\n\n- increase other's num by 1.\n\n- if current was red, set other's red to true (but current's red remains true? Wait, in the Java code, in case 3, the red is not set to false. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the Box's moveTo method:\n\nif (num == 1) {\n\n    num = 0;\n\n    other.num++;\n\n    if (red) {\n\n        other.red = true;\n\n    }\n\n    red = false;\n\n} else {\n\n    num--;\n\n    other.num++;\n\n    if (red) {\n\n        other.red = true;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the else (num >1), after moving, the current box's red remains as it was. Because the code only sets red to false in the case when num was 1. So in the else case (num >1), the current's red is not changed. So the red flag is only transferred when moving the last marble (when num was 1). Otherwise, when moving one of multiple marbles, the red stays in the original box?\n\nWait, the code in the else block (num !=0 and not 1, so >=2):\n\nnum is decreased by 1, other's num increases by 1.\n\nIf the current box's red was true, then the other's red is set to true. But the current's red remains true?\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIn the else block (num >1):\n\nnum-- (so decreases by 1)\n\nother.num +=1\n\nif (red) then other.red = true.\n\nBut the current's red is not set to false here. So the current's red remains true even after moving a marble. So the red flag is only cleared when the box's num was 1 and it's moving the last marble.\n\nSo in the case where a box has multiple marbles and red is true, moving one marble to another box will set the other's red to true, but the original's red remains true. So the red flag is a property of the box, not the marble. Wait, but the red is supposed to represent whether the red marble is in the box. So if the box has multiple marbles, and the red is true, then moving one marble (not the red one?) Hmm, perhaps the red flag indicates whether the red marble is present in the box. So when moving marbles, if the box has the red marble (red is true), then when moving marbles, the red marble can be moved or not?\n\nWait, the code's logic is that when moving marbles, if the current box has red = true, then the other box's red is set to true. But the current's red is only set to false when the current's num was 1 (so moving the last marble, which was red). Otherwise, when moving a marble from a box with red = true (and num >1), the other box's red is set to true, but the current's red remains true. So the red marble is considered to be in both boxes? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the red flag indicates whether the box contains the red marble. So when moving marbles, if the current box has the red marble (red is true), then when moving marbles, the red marble is moved along with the marbles?\n\nHmm, perhaps the red marble is part of the marbles. So when you have a box with red = true, that means the red marble is in that box. When moving marbles, if you move all marbles (when num is 1), then the red marble is moved, so the destination's red becomes true, and the source's red becomes false. If you move one marble from a box with multiple marbles (num >1), then the red marble stays in the source, so the destination's red is set to true (if the source had red), but the source's red remains true. Wait, but that would mean the red marble is in both boxes, which is impossible. So perhaps the code's logic is that the red marble is only in one box at a time. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nLooking at the Java code's move method:\n\nWhen moving from box A to box B:\n\nCase 1: A's num is 0: do nothing.\n\nCase 2: A's num is 1:\n\n- A's num becomes 0, so it has no marbles.\n\n- B's num increases by 1 (now has at least 1).\n\n- If A was red (had the red marble), then B's red is set to true, and A's red is set to false.\n\nSo in this case, the red marble is moved to B.\n\nCase 3: A's num >1:\n\n- A's num decreases by 1.\n\n- B's num increases by 1.\n\n- If A was red (had the red marble), then B's red is set to true. But A's red remains true.\n\nWait, so in this case, after moving, both A and B have red = true? That would imply the red marble is in both boxes, which is impossible. So perhaps the code's logic is that the red marble is only in the box where it was originally, unless it's moved entirely (when the box's num was 1). So when moving a single marble from a box with multiple marbles, the red marble stays in the original box, but the destination's red is set to true? That would be a problem. Maybe the code's logic is that the red marble is part of the marbles, so when you move marbles, the red marble is moved only when the entire marble count is moved (i.e., when the box had 1 marble). Otherwise, when moving a portion, the red marble stays. But the code's logic in case 3 allows the destination's red to be set to true even if the source still has marbles. So perhaps the red flag is not about the presence of the red marble, but something else. Alternatively, maybe the red flag is a separate property, and the code's logic is that whenever a marble is moved from a box with red=true, the destination's red is set to true, but the source's remains true. That would mean the red marble is duplicated, which is not possible. Hmm, perhaps the code's logic is that the red marble is only in the box where it was originally, and when moving marbles, the red flag is only transferred when the entire marble is moved. Otherwise, the red flag remains in the source. But the code's case 3 allows the destination's red to be set to true even if the source still has marbles. So perhaps the red flag is not about the presence of the red marble, but something else. Alternatively, maybe the red flag indicates whether the box has ever contained the red marble. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the red flag is a separate property, and the code's logic is that whenever a marble is moved from a box with red=true, the destination's red is set to true, but the source's red remains true. So the red marble is considered to be in both boxes? That's conflicting. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the red flag indicates whether the box contains the red marble. So when moving marbles from a box with red=true (so it has the red marble), moving marbles can split the marbles. But the red marble can only be in one box. So the code's logic must ensure that only one box has red=true at any time. Let me see:\n\nIn case 2 (moving the last marble from a box with red=true):\n\n- The source's red is set to false, and the destination's red is set to true. So the red marble moves.\n\nIn case 3 (moving one marble from a box with red=true and num>1):\n\n- The destination's red is set to true (so now both have red=true?), but the source's red remains true. That would imply the red marble is in both boxes, which is impossible. So perhaps the code's logic is incorrect, but according to the problem's code, that's how it works. So in the problem's code, the red flag can be true in multiple boxes. But that's probably a mistake, but since we have to translate the code as is, we have to follow it.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the Box structure will have num and red. The move function must be implemented exactly as per the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran, the move function would be a subroutine that takes two boxes (source and destination) and modifies them according to the rules.\n\nNow, the first part's steps in Fortran:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize boxes(1:N):\n\nboxes(1)%num = 1\n\nboxes(1)%red = .true.\n\nboxes(2:N)%num = 1\n\nboxes(2:N)%red = .false.\n\nThen, read M pairs of x and y (1-based indices).\n\nFor each pair, call the move subroutine with boxes(x) and boxes(y).\n\nAfter all moves, count the number of boxes where red is true. That's the counter.\n\nThen, convert this counter to a string (since it's the input to the second program).\n\nSecond part (Java's second program):\n\nThe input is the counter's string (e.g., \"5\" if the counter was 5). The processing is to add a space before a letter if the previous character is not a letter. The first character is added as is. The output is the processed string.\n\nWait, but the counter is an integer, so its string representation is a sequence of digits. So the input to the second program is a string like \"1234\". The processing would be:\n\nTake each character. Since they are all digits (assuming the counter is non-negative, which it is), then the second program's processing would not add any spaces, because digits are not letters. The isLatinLetter function checks if c is between 'a' and 'z'. So digits are not letters, so the second program's processing would just output the same string as input, since all characters are non-letters and non-punctuation (assuming the counter is a number like 123, which has no punctuation). Wait, but the second program's code includes punctuation handling. The input is a number string, so no punctuation. So the second program's output would be the same as the input string. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer, which when converted to a string is, say, \"5\". The second program would process that as a single character (digit), so the output is \"5\".\n\nWait, but the second program's code adds a space before a letter only if the previous character is not a letter. Since the input is all digits, there are no letters, so the output is the same as the input. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the second program's processing is redundant here. But perhaps the user's sequence requires it, so we have to include it.\n\nThird part (Java's third program):\n\nThe input is the output of the second program, which is the same as the first's output (the counter's string). The third program reads this string S, and computes the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string S. For example, if the first program's output was 5, then the third program's input is \"5\". The third program would process \"5\" as a string of length 1. The code for the third program:\n\nIt computes mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe string S is processed from the end. For each position i (from 0 to N-1 in Java, but in Fortran, perhaps 1-based), the code calculates the mod value.\n\nThe algorithm is to compute for each position i (starting from the end), the value of the substring S[0..i] mod 2019, but using a different approach. Wait, the code in Java loops from i=0 to N-1 (Java's loop is for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)), but the string is processed in reverse (N-1 -i). Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n    if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, the first character processed is the last character of the original string (since N-1 -i starts at N-1 when i=0). So the code is processing the string from the end to the beginning. The variable 'radix' starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 2019. The mod_arr[i] holds the value of the substring from the end up to position (N-1 -i) mod 2019. \n\nThe idea is to compute for each position the value of the number formed by the substring S[0..k] mod 2019, but in reverse. Wait, perhaps the code is calculating the mod for all suffixes. The key is that the number formed by the substring S[0..k] can be represented as (digit * 10^{length-1} + ...) mod 2019. The algorithm uses a mathematical approach to compute these mods efficiently.\n\nThe final answer is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], plus the count of mod 0 (since a single substring starting at 0 and ending at j would also count if mod is 0).\n\nWait, the code increments mod_cnt[tmp] for each mod value. Then, after processing all, it calculates ans += mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 for all i. This counts the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. Additionally, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 before the loop. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, why? Let me see:\n\nThe code first initializes mod_cnt as all zeros. Then, during the loop, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. After the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. Then, the ans is computed as the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2).\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 0 is added to account for the empty substring? Or maybe there's an off-by-one error. Alternatively, the code might have a mistake, but we have to follow it as written.\n\nIn any case, the third program's code must be translated into Fortran.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will have the following steps:\n\n1. Read N and M from input.\n\n2. Process the first part (boxes) to get the counter.\n\n3. Convert counter to a string (e.g., using write and read to a character variable).\n\n4. Process the second part (string processing) on that string to get the processed string.\n\n5. Process the third part (mod 2019 calculation) on the processed string.\n\n6. Output the result of the third part.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures and steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (boxes):\n\nDefine a type for Box:\n\ntype box_type\n    integer :: num\n    logical :: red\nend type box_type\n\nThen, declare an array of boxes:\n\ninteger :: N, M\ntype(box_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: boxes\n\nRead N and M:\n\nread*, N, M\n\nallocate(boxes(N))\n\nInitialize boxes:\n\nboxes(1)%num = 1\nboxes(1)%red = .true.\n\ndo i = 2, N\n    boxes(i)%num = 1\n    boxes(i)%red = .false.\nend do\n\nThen, read M pairs of x and y (1-based):\n\ndo i = 1, M\n    read*, x, y\n    call move_box(boxes(x), boxes(y))\nend do\n\nThe move_box subroutine must implement the logic of the Java's Box.moveTo method.\n\nSubroutine move_box(source, dest):\n\ntype(box_type), intent(inout) :: source, dest\n\nif (source%num == 0) then\n    return\nelse if (source%num == 1) then\n    source%num = 0\n    dest%num = dest%num + 1\n    if (source%red) then\n        dest%red = .true.\n        source%red = .false.\n    end if\nelse\n    source%num = source%num -1\n    dest%num = dest%num +1\n    if (source%red) then\n        dest%red = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nWait, but in the else case (source%num >1), the source's red remains as it was. So the code above correctly sets dest%red to true if source was red, but leaves source%red unchanged.\n\nAfter processing all moves, count the number of boxes with red = true:\n\ncounter = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    if (boxes(i)%red) counter = counter +1\nend do\n\nThen, convert counter to a string. To do this in Fortran, we can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: counter_str\nwrite(counter_str, '(i0)') counter\ncounter_str = adjustl(counter_str)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\nNow, the second part (processing the string):\n\nThe input string is counter_str. The processing is as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second program's processing:\n\nThe input is a string s. The output is a string where before each letter (a-z), if the previous character is not a letter, a space is added. The first character is added as is.\n\nIn Fortran, we can process each character:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_in = counter_str\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: processed_str\ninteger :: n = len_trim(s_in)\ninteger :: i\ncharacter :: c_prev, c_current\nprocessed_str = s_in(1:1)\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    c_current = s_in(i:i)\n    c_prev = s_in(i-1:i-1)\n    if (is_latin_letter(c_current)) then\n        if (.not. is_latin_letter(c_prev)) then\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // ' ' // c_current\n        else\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // c_current\n        end if\n    else if (is_punctuation(c_current)) then\n        processed_str = trim(processed_str) // c_current\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation can be done with //, but we need to manage the length. Alternatively, use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array to build the processed string.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with sufficient length.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a character array:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: processed_str\ninteger :: len_out = 1\nprocessed_str = s_in(1:1)\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    c_current = s_in(i:i)\n    c_prev = s_in(i-1:i-1)\n    if (is_latin_letter(c_current)) then\n        if (.not. is_latin_letter(c_prev)) then\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // ' ' // c_current\n        else\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // c_current\n        end if\n    else if (is_punctuation(c_current)) then\n        processed_str = trim(processed_str) // c_current\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the trim is needed to avoid trailing spaces when concatenating. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written with a character array and indices.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of sufficient length. Let's think of the functions:\n\nFirst, need functions to check if a character is a Latin letter or punctuation.\n\nFunction is_latin_letter(c) result(res)\n    character, intent(in) :: c\n    logical :: res\n    res = (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z')\nend function\n\nFunction is_punctuation(c) result(res)\n    character, intent(in) :: c\n    logical :: res\n    res = (c == '.' .or. c == ',' .or. c == '!' .or. c == '?')\nend function\n\nNow, the processing loop:\n\nInitialize processed_str as the first character.\n\nThen loop from 2 to n:\n\nFor each character:\n\nIf it's a letter:\n\nCheck previous character. If previous is not a letter, add a space before it.\n\nElse, just add the character.\n\nIf it's punctuation, add it as is.\n\nElse, ignore? Or perhaps the code in Java only processes letters and punctuation, others are ignored? Looking at the second Java program's code:\n\nIn the loop over i from 1 to n-1 (Java's code):\n\nif (isLatinLetter(c)) {\n\n    if (!isLatinLetter(s.charAt(i-1))) {\n\n        append space and c.\n\n    } else append c.\n\n} else if (isPunctuation(c)) {\n\n    append c.\n\n}\n\nElse, do nothing? Because the code only appends when it's a letter or punctuation. So in Fortran, for other characters (digits, etc.), they are not added. Wait, in the Java code, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    char c = s.charAt(i);\n\n    if (isLatinLetter(c)) {\n\n        if (!isLatinLetter(s.charAt(i-1))) {\n\n            sb.append(' ');\n\n        }\n\n        sb.append(c);\n\n    } else if (isPunctuation(c)) {\n\n        sb.append(c);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the code appends the current character only if it's a letter or punctuation. So other characters (digits, etc.) are skipped. So in the case of the input being a number string (digits), the second program's processing would not add anything except the first character, and the rest are skipped. Wait, no, because the first character is added in the initial step (sb.append(s.charAt(0))). Then, for the rest (i from 1 to n-1):\n\nFor each character c (starting at index 1 in Java, which is the second character in the string):\n\nIf c is a letter, then append space if needed and the character.\n\nIf it's punctuation, append it.\n\nElse, do nothing. So digits are not added. So the second program's output would be the first character (a digit) followed by nothing else, because the rest are digits and not letters or punctuation. Wait, but the first character is added as is. For example, if the input is \"123\", then:\n\nInitial sb has '1'.\n\nThen for i=1 (Java's index 1, which is the second character '2'):\n\nc is '2', which is not a letter or punctuation. So it's skipped. So the processed string is just '1'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the second program would truncate the string to the first character if the input is all digits. But according to the problem's sequence, the first program's output is an integer (like 5), which is converted to a string \"5\". The second program would process it as follows:\n\nThe first character is '5', added to the string. Then, since there are no other characters (length 1), the loop doesn't run. So the output is \"5\".\n\nWait, if the input is \"123\", then the second program's output would be \"1\", because the second and third characters are digits and not added. But that's a problem. However, according to the problem's sequence, the second program's output is the input to the third program. So if the first program's output is 123, the second program's output is \"1\", which is then the input to the third program. The third program would process \"1\" as the string S, leading to a different result than if the input was \"123\".\n\nBut according to the original Java code's sequence, the second program's processing would indeed truncate the string. So we have to follow that.\n\nTherefore, in the case of the input being a number string (digits only), the second program's output is the first character only. So the third program will process that.\n\nNow, moving to the third part.\n\nThe third part's input is the processed string (from the second part). Let's call it s_processed.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nRead the string S (s_processed).\n\nCompute the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nThe algorithm in the third Java program is as follows:\n\nInitialize mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays.\n\nmod_arr is an array of length N (the length of S).\n\nmod_cnt is an array of size 2019 (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018).\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to zero.\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1 (Java's loop):\n\nIn Fortran, since strings are 1-based, perhaps the loop is from 1 to N.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n    if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the string is s_processed, with length n = len_trim(s_processed).\n\nWe need to process each character from the end to the beginning.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn Fortran, the characters are 1-based. So for i from 1 to n:\n\nThe position in the string is (n - i + 1). Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nThe character is at position N-1 -i. So when i=0, it's the last character (position N-1 in 0-based, which is position N in 1-based). Wait, no, in Java, the string is 0-based. So for a string of length N, the last character is at index N-1. So in the loop, for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nThe character is at position (N-1 -i). So when i=0, it's the last character (N-1), when i=1, it's N-2, etc., down to i=N-1, which is 0.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is 1-based. So for a string of length n, the characters are 1 to n. So to process from the end to the beginning, for each step i from 1 to n:\n\nThe character is at position (n - i +1). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=5. For i=1, the position is 5 (the last character). For i=2, position 4, etc. So the index in the string is (n - i +1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to loop over the characters in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the loop can be:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    current_char = s_processed(n - i +1 : n -i +1)\n\n    ... \n\nend do\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor i from 1 to n:\n\nThe position is (n -i +1). For i=1: n, i=2: n-1, ..., i=n: 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: mod_val = 2019\n\ninteger :: n = len_trim(s_processed)\n\ninteger, dimension(0:mod_val-1) :: mod_cnt = 0\n\ninteger, dimension(n) :: mod_arr\n\ninteger :: radix = 1\n\nmod_arr = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    integer :: pos = n - i +1\n\n    character :: c = s_processed(pos:pos)\n\n    integer :: digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n    integer :: tmp = mod(digit * radix, mod_val)\n\n    if (i >1) then\n\n        tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), mod_val)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n    mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n    radix = mod(radix *10, mod_val)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the mod_arr is of size N (same as the string length). The loop runs for each character, and mod_arr[i] (Java's 0-based) corresponds to the first i+1 characters processed (from the end). \n\nWait, in the Java code, mod_arr[i] is the value for the first i+1 characters (since i starts at 0). \n\nIn Fortran, the loop is from 1 to n, so mod_arr(i) corresponds to the first i characters processed (from the end). \n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt is updated. Then, the code in Java does mod_cnt[0] +=1 before calculating the answer. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nThen, ans += mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 for all i.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, why? Let me see:\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    ... \n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n}\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n\n    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2;\n\n}\n\nWait, the mod_cnt[0] is incremented after the loop. So the initial loop counts the occurrences of each mod value from the mod_arr entries. Then, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\nPossibly, this is to account for the empty substring? Or perhaps there's an off-by-one error. Alternatively, maybe the code is incorrect, but we have to follow it.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran:\n\nAfter the loop over i=1 to n:\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nThen, compute the answer:\n\ninteger :: ans =0\n\ndo i =0, mod_val-1\n\n    ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) -1)/2\n\nend do\n\nFinally, output ans.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have the following structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    !

For example, in the second part's processing, the variable s_in is not declared. Also, the code may have some syntax errors. Let me check:\n\nIn the second part processing:\n\nAfter converting counter to counter_str, we have:\n\ns_in = counter_str\n\nBut s_in is not declared. Need to declare it as a character variable.\n\nAlso, the processed_str is declared as allocatable, but in the code above, it's initialized with s_in(1:1). But in Fortran, when using allocatable variables, you need to allocate them first. Alternatively, use a fixed-length character variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character array with sufficient length.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nIn the second part:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_in = counter_str\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: processed_str\n\nprocessed_str = s_in(1:1)\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nprocessed_str = trim(processed_str) // ... \n\nBut need to manage the length properly. Alternatively, use a character array and track the length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with sufficient length, say 200.\n\nAlso, in the third part, the mod_arr needs to be allocated with size n_third.\n\nWait, in the code above, after n_third is determined, mod_arr is allocated as:\n\nallocate(mod_arr(n_third))\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother issue: in the third part's loop, the digit is computed as ichar(c) - ichar('0'). But if the character is not a digit (like a letter or punctuation), this would give an invalid digit. However, in the third part's input s_processed, which is the output of the second program, which only includes letters, punctuation, or the first character (a digit). Wait, the second program's processing may have left non-digit characters. For example, if the first program's output was \"a\", then the second program would process it as \"a\", and the third program would process it. But in the third program's code, the digit is computed as ichar(c) - ichar('0'), which for non-digits would be invalid. However, according to the problem's sequence, the first program's output is an integer, so the second program's input is a number string, so the processed_str would be the first character of that (a digit), so the third program's input is a single digit. So the code would work in that case. But if the first program's output is a string with letters (unlikely, since it's an integer), then the third program would have issues. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is an integer, so the third program's input is a string of digits (possibly truncated by the second program).\n\nTherefore, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part's loop, the mod_arr is initialized to zero, but in the code above, mod_arr is allocated and then set to zero with mod_arr =0. But in Fortran, after allocation, you can do mod_arr = 0.\n\nNow, putting all together with corrections:\n\nHere's the corrected Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    !
