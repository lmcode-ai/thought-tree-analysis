But during processing, maybe after some steps, all elements become zero except one, but then in the next step, that element mod min (which is itself) would be zero, so the next step would have all zeros again. Hmm, but in that case, the next step would have m=1 (the element is non-zero, but then mod by itself gives zero, so in the next step, it would be removed, leading to m=0. So need to handle that. So after step 1 (removing zeros), if m becomes 0, then output 0.\n\n3.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC118_C). It reads an integer n, then a list of integers. If n is 1, it just outputs that number. Otherwise, it sorts the list and processes it through a function 'func' repeatedly until a condition is met. The function 'func' removes zeros, finds the minimum, and replaces elements with mod by the min, then sorts again. The final answer is the last remaining number.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1, and outputs 1 if not, 0 otherwise. Wait, actually, the code seems to do: if x is 1, then bool is true, so result is 0 (since !bool is false). So the output is 0 when x is 1, else 1. Wait, let me check the code again. The code says: bool = x ==1 ? true : false. Then result is !bool ? 1 :0. Wait, no: the code says result = !bool ? 1 :0. Wait, no, the code is written as:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWait, no, the code is written as:\n\nboolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\nint result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nSo if x is 1, then bool is true, so !bool is false, so result is 0. If x is not 1, then result is 1. So the second program's output is 1 when x !=1, else 0.\n\nThird Java file (codeforces_59_A) takes a string, counts uppercase and lowercase letters, then converts the string to all lowercase if lowercase count is higher or equal, else uppercase. If counts are equal, lowercase.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these three Java programs into a single Fortran program. The input comes from the first program, and the output is from the third. The outputs of each Java program are the inputs to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? Let me think. The first program's output is the input to the second, which takes an integer x. The second program's output is an integer (0 or 1), which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a string, but the second's output is an integer. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, which takes an integer x. The second program's output is an integer (0 or 1), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which is expecting an integer. The second's output is the input to the third, which expects a string. But the second's output is an integer (0 or 1). So the third program would read that as a string? Or maybe the second's output is a single integer, which is then passed as a string to the third program. For example, if the second outputs \"0\", then the third reads that as the string \"0\".\n\nWait, the third program's input is a single string. So the second program's output must be a single line of text, which is the input to the third. So the second program outputs either \"0\" or \"1\", which is then read as the string by the third program. Wait, but the third program expects a single word, like \"aBc\" or something. So the third program would take the output of the second (which is a number, either 0 or 1) as a string. For example, if the second outputs \"1\", then the third's input is \"1\", so the string is \"1\", which has uppercase count 0 and lowercase 1, so it would output lowercase, so \"1\" again. Wait, but the third program's code checks for uppercase and lowercase letters. The digits are neither, so they don't count. So in the third program, if the input is \"1\", then uppercase is 0, lowercase is 0, so the counts are equal, so it converts to lowercase, which is still \"1\". So the third program's output would be \"1\".\n\nHmm, okay. So the sequence is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first's output \u2192 second's input \u2192 second's output \u2192 third's input \u2192 third's output.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, without any I/O except first reading input and last outputting the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (the first Java file's input).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic, getting its result (the 'ans' variable).\n\n3. Take that result as the input to the second program (the second Java file's x).\n\n4. Process the second program's logic, getting its result (0 or 1).\n\n5. Take that result as the input to the third program (the third Java file's word, as a string).\n\n6. Process the third program's logic, getting the final output string.\n\nThen, the Fortran program should output that final string.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (the first part's input).\n\n- Compute the first part's output (the 'ans' value).\n\n- Use that ans as the input to the second part (so x = ans).\n\n- Compute the second part's output (0 or 1).\n\n- Use that as the input to the third part (so the string is the string representation of that number).\n\n- Compute the third part's output (the modified string).\n\n- Finally, print that string.\n\nNow, let's think about each part's implementation in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (Java's first file):\n\nThe first Java program's input is:\n\nFirst line: n (integer), followed by n integers.\n\nThe first program's output is the 'ans' variable, which is the result of the process.\n\nThe process is:\n\n- If n is 1, output the single number.\n\n- Else, process the list through the 'func' function until only one element remains.\n\nThe 'func' function does:\n\n- Remove all zeros.\n\n- Find the minimum non-zero element (since after removing zeros, the list has no zeros).\n\n- Replace each element with element mod min.\n\n- If any element mod min is 1, then output 1 and exit.\n\n- Then sort the list again.\n\nWait, the code in 'func' is a bit tricky. Let me re-examine the Java code for 'func':\n\nThe function 'func' takes an ArrayList A, and returns a new list.\n\nThe code inside:\n\nArrayList<Integer> a = A; // but this is a reference, so modifying a would modify A? Wait, no, in Java, when you assign a = A, it's a reference. So any changes to a would affect the original. But in the function, since it's passed as a parameter, but the function returns a new list? Wait, no, the code is:\n\nprivate static ArrayList<Integer> func(ArrayList<Integer> A) {\n\n    ArrayList<Integer> a = A; // so a is the same as A.\n\n    int min = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {\n\n        if (a.get(i) == 0) {\n\n            a.remove(i);\n\n            i--;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if (min != 0) {\n\n                a.set(i, a.get(i) % min);\n\n                if (a.get(i) == 1) {\n\n                    System.out.println(1);\n\n                    System.exit(0);\n\n                }\n\n            } else {\n\n                min = a.get(i);\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    Collections.sort(a);\n\n    return a;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the code is modifying the list a (which is the same as A) in place. However, the function returns a, which is the same as A. But in the main function, after each call to func, the list is reassigned to the return value. Wait, in the main loop:\n\na = func(a);\n\nSo each time, the list is passed to func, which modifies it, and returns it. But since the function is modifying the list in place, the return is redundant. Hmm, perhaps the code is a bit redundant, but the key steps are:\n\n- Remove all zeros from the list.\n\n- Find the minimum element (since after removing zeros, min is initialized to 0, but then first non-zero element sets min, then others are mod by min.\n\nWait, let's walk through the code step by step.\n\nThe 'min' is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a (the list):\n\nIf the element is 0, remove it and adjust the index.\n\nElse:\n\nIf min is not 0 (i.e., already set), then set a[i] to a[i] mod min. Then check if that mod is 1, if so, output 1 and exit.\n\nElse (min is 0), set min to a[i].\n\nWait, but the first non-zero element sets min to itself. Then, for subsequent elements, they are mod by min. But the order here is important because the loop is going from start to end. So the first element (after removing zeros) is the first non-zero, which becomes min. Then, the next elements are mod by that min. But since the list is sorted before each call to func, perhaps the min is the first element?\n\nWait, in the main function, after each call to func, the list is sorted again. Wait, no, the code in the main loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    if (a.size() == 1) break;\n\n    a = func(a);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the 'func' function ends with a sort. So after each call to func, the list is sorted again. So the process is:\n\nEach iteration of the loop:\n\n- Call func, which processes the list (removing zeros, modding, etc.), then sorts it again.\n\nWait, the 'func' function's last step is to sort the list again. So after each call to func, the list is sorted.\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the list is [4,6,8]. The first time through func:\n\nmin starts at 0.\n\nFirst element is 4 (since list is sorted). Since min is 0, set min to 4.\n\nSecond element is 6: since min is now 4, compute 6 mod 4 \u2192 2. So set to 2. Check if 2 is 1? No.\n\nThird element is 8 mod 4 \u2192 0. Wait, 8 mod 4 is 0. So set to 0. Then, in the next iteration, when processing that element, since it's 0, it will be removed.\n\nWait, but after processing all elements, the list is [4,2,0]. Then, the loop continues, but in the next iteration, the code removes the 0, so the list becomes [4,2]. Then, the next step is to sort again (since the function ends with a sort). Wait, after the loop over elements, the code sorts the list again. So after processing the elements, the list is [4,2,0], then after removing the 0, the list is [4,2], then sorted becomes [2,4].\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nInside the 'func' function:\n\nAfter processing each element (removing zeros and modding), the list is then sorted again before returning.\n\nSo the steps for the example [4,6,8]:\n\nAfter processing:\n\nAfter first element (4), min is 4.\n\nSecond element (6 mod 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 stored.\n\nThird element (8 mod 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 stored as 0.\n\nThen, the loop continues, but after processing all elements, the list is [4,2,0].\n\nThen, the code removes the 0 (since in the loop, when i reaches the third element (index 2), it's 0, so it's removed, so the list becomes [4,2].\n\nWait, but the code's loop is over the elements. Let me see:\n\nThe loop is for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.get(i) == 0) {\n\n        a.remove(i);\n\n        i--;\n\n    } else {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo when processing the third element (index 2), which is 0, it's removed, so the list becomes [4,2], and the loop's i is decremented to 1. Then, the next iteration is i=1 (since after removal, the next element is at index 1, but the loop continues until i reaches the new size (2 elements, so i starts at 0, then 1, then after removal, the next i is 1, but after that, the loop ends.\n\nWait, perhaps the code in 'func' first removes all zeros from the list. Because whenever it encounters a zero, it removes it and adjusts the index. So after processing all elements, the list has no zeros. Then, the mod operations are done on the non-zero elements.\n\nWait, the code first removes all zeros, then processes the remaining elements. Because the loop is over the list, and whenever a zero is found, it's removed, so after the loop, the list has no zeros. Then, the mod operations are done on the non-zero elements.\n\nWait, but the code is interleaving the removal of zeros and the mod operations. Let me think again.\n\nThe loop is processing each element in order. For each element:\n\nIf it's zero, remove it and decrement i so that the next element (now at the same index) is processed next.\n\nElse, process the mod.\n\nSo the loop effectively removes all zeros first, because whenever a zero is found, it's removed immediately, and the loop continues from the same index. So after the first pass through the list, all zeros are removed. Then, the remaining elements are processed for the mod.\n\nWait, no. Because the loop is processing elements in order, and when a zero is found, it's removed, so the next elements shift left. The loop's i is adjusted so that the next element (now at the same index) is reprocessed. So the loop effectively removes all zeros first, before proceeding to process the mod steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the code first removes all zeros, then processes the remaining elements for mod.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the list is [0, 4, 6, 8].\n\nThe first element is 0 \u2192 removed, i becomes -1, then i increments to 0 again. The next element is now 4 (since the list is now [4,6,8]).\n\nThen, processing 4: min is 0 \u2192 set to 4.\n\nNext element 6: mod 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 stored.\n\nNext element 8 mod 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 stored as 0? Wait, no, after mod, it's 0, but since we already removed zeros, but in this case, the mod result is 0, so the element becomes 0. But since the loop has already passed that element, the zero is not removed again. Wait, but after the mod, the element is set to 0, but the loop has already moved past that index. So in this case, the element becomes 0, but since the loop is over, it's left in the list. Then, in the next iteration of the main loop, when func is called again, that zero will be removed.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the algorithm's purpose.\n\nThe problem seems to be similar to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements, but with some conditions. Because the process of taking mod with the minimum and then sorting again might be equivalent to computing the GCD.\n\nWait, in the first example, if the list is [4,6,8], the GCD is 2. Let's see what the code does:\n\nFirst iteration of the main loop:\n\nAfter first call to func:\n\nThe list is [4,6,8].\n\nProcessing:\n\nRemove zeros (none here).\n\nThen, min starts at 0.\n\nFirst element (4) \u2192 min becomes 4.\n\nSecond element (6 mod 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 stored.\n\nThird element (8 mod 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 stored as 0.\n\nThen, after processing all elements, the list is [4,2,0].\n\nThen, the code removes the 0 (since in the loop, when it reaches the third element (0), it's removed. So the list becomes [4,2].\n\nThen, the list is sorted again (so [2,4]).\n\nThe function returns this list.\n\nBack to the main loop, the list is now [2,4].\n\nNext iteration of the loop:\n\nCall func again.\n\nProcessing the list [2,4].\n\nFirst, remove zeros (none).\n\nmin is 0.\n\nFirst element is 2 \u2192 min becomes 2.\n\nSecond element (4 mod 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 stored as 0.\n\nThen, after processing, the list is [2,0].\n\nThen, the loop removes the 0, so the list becomes [2].\n\nThen, the list is sorted (still [2]).\n\nThe function returns [2].\n\nBack to main loop, the list size is now 1 \u2192 exit loop. The ans is 2, which is the GCD of 4,6,8.\n\nSo the code is effectively computing the GCD of all elements. Interesting. So the first program's output is the GCD of the input numbers, except when there's a 1 in the mod steps, which would trigger an early exit with 1.\n\nWait, but in the code, whenever an element mod min becomes 1, it outputs 1 and exits. So if during any step, an element mod min is 1, then the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, so the algorithm is similar to the GCD process but with an early exit if any remainder becomes 1. So the first program's output is either 1 (if any step produces a remainder of 1) or the GCD of all elements (if no such step occurs).\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is either 1 or the GCD of the input numbers (if all steps don't hit a remainder of 1).\n\nSo to implement this in Fortran, I need to:\n\nRead n and the list of integers.\n\nIf n is 1, output the single number.\n\nElse, process the list as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input handling:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array.\n\nThen, process the list.\n\nThe processing steps:\n\nWe need to loop until the list has one element.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n- Remove all zeros from the list.\n\n- If the list is empty (all zeros except when n=1, but the first check handles n=1), but the code in Java has a check: if after sorting, the last element is zero, then output 0. Wait, looking back at the first Java code:\n\nIn the main function:\n\nif (a.get(a.size() - 1) == 0) {\n\n    System.out.println(0);\n\n    System.exit(0);\n\n}\n\nWait, this is after the initial check for n=1 and after reading the list. So if after sorting, the maximum element is zero (i.e., all elements are zero), then output 0 and exit.\n\nSo in the first program, if all elements are zero, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the list, we need to check if all elements are zero (except when n=1, which is handled earlier). So first, after reading the list, check if all elements are zero. If so, output 0 and exit.\n\nElse, proceed with the loop.\n\nThen, the main loop:\n\nWhile the list has more than one element:\n\n- Call the 'func' equivalent, which processes the list as per the steps.\n\nThe 'func' steps:\n\n1. Remove all zeros from the list.\n\n2. Find the minimum element (since after removing zeros, the list has at least one element).\n\n3. For each element in the list (excluding zeros, which are already removed):\n\n   a. Replace it with element mod min.\n\n   b. If any element mod min is 1, then output 1 and exit.\n\n4. Sort the list again.\n\nWait, but in the code, the mod is done in the loop, and the check for 1 is done immediately. So during processing, if any element mod min is 1, the program exits with 1.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, during the processing of the elements, whenever an element mod min is 1, we can immediately return 1 as the answer.\n\nSo the steps for the 'func' function in Fortran would be:\n\n- Create a new list (since in Java, the list is modified in place, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, so perhaps we need to handle this with dynamic arrays or by using a temporary array).\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran arrays are fixed size, perhaps we can use an array and track the current size.\n\nHmm, this is going to be a bit tricky. Let me think of the steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the list can be represented as an array with a current size. Let's say we have an array a of size n, and a variable m which is the current number of elements.\n\nInitially, m = n.\n\nBut when elements are removed (like zeros), m decreases.\n\nWait, but in the first step, after reading the list, we can first check if all elements are zero. If so, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, in each iteration of the main loop (while m > 1):\n\n- Remove zeros from the array, updating m.\n\n- If after removing zeros, m is 0, then output 0 (but this can't happen because we already checked earlier? Or maybe after some steps, but need to handle).\n\nWait, perhaps after removing zeros, if m becomes 0, then the answer is 0. But in the first check, if all elements are zero, we output 0. But during processing, maybe after some steps, all elements become zero except one, but then in the next step, that element mod min (which is zero?) no, because min is the first non-zero element.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n1. Remove zeros from the array, updating m.\n\n   - To do this, we can loop through the array, and copy non-zero elements to a new array, then set m to the new count.\n\n   - Alternatively, in-place, shift elements.\n\n   For example, in Fortran:\n\n   We can have an array a of size n, and m as the current count.\n\n   To remove zeros:\n\n   new_m = 0\n\n   do i = 1, m\n\n      if (a(i) /= 0) then\n\n          new_m = new_m +1\n\n          a(new_m) = a(i)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   m = new_m\n\n   So after this, the array a(1:m) contains the non-zero elements.\n\n2. If m == 0, then output 0 and exit.\n\n   (But this can only happen if all elements were zero, which was already checked earlier, but perhaps after some steps?)\n\n   Wait, in the first step, after reading the list, if all elements are zero, then output 0. But during processing, maybe after some steps, all elements become zero except one, but then in the next step, that element mod min (which is itself) would be zero, so the next step would have all zeros again. Hmm, but in that case, the next step would have m=1 (the element is non-zero, but then mod by itself gives zero, so in the next step, it would be removed, leading to m=0. So need to handle that.\n\n   So after step 1 (removing zeros), if m becomes 0, then output 0.\n\n3. Find the minimum element in the current array (a(1:m)).\n\n   min_val = a(1)\n\n   do i = 2, m\n\n      if (a(i) < min_val) min_val = a(i)\n\n   end do\n\n4. Now, process each element:\n\n   For each element in a(1:m):\n\n      new_val = mod(a(i), min_val)\n\n      if (new_val == 1) then\n\n          ans = 1\n\n          exit the entire program\n\n      end if\n\n      a(i) = new_val\n\n   end do\n\n   Wait, but in the Java code, the mod is done only after the min is set. The first element sets the min, then others are mod by min.\n\n   Wait, in the Java code, the min is initialized to 0. Then, for each element (after removing zeros):\n\n   The first element (since the list is sorted) is the first non-zero, so when min is 0, it sets min to that element. Then, the next elements are mod by min.\n\n   Wait, in the Java code, the min is set to the first non-zero element, then the rest are mod by that min.\n\n   Wait, in the code:\n\n   The loop over the elements (after removing zeros) is:\n\n   for each element in a (after removing zeros):\n\n      if min is not 0 \u2192 mod by min.\n\n      else \u2192 set min to this element.\n\n   So the first element (since the list is sorted) is the first non-zero, so min is set to that element. Then, the rest are mod by min.\n\n   So in Fortran, after step 3 (finding the min_val), we can proceed as:\n\n   min_val is the minimum of the current array (since it's sorted? Wait, in the Java code, after each call to func, the list is sorted again. Wait, in the Java code, after processing the elements, the list is sorted again before returning.\n\n   Wait, in the 'func' function, after processing the elements (removing zeros and modding), the code does:\n\n   Collections.sort(a);\n\n   So the list is sorted again before returning.\n\n   Therefore, in the Fortran code, after processing the elements (modding), we need to sort the array again.\n\n   So the steps in Fortran for the 'func' equivalent:\n\n   After step 1 (remove zeros, m is the count):\n\n   if m ==0 \u2192 output 0 and exit.\n\n   find min_val (the minimum of a(1:m)).\n\n   then, for each element in a(1:m):\n\n      a(i) = mod(a(i), min_val)\n\n      if any a(i) ==1 \u2192 output 1 and exit.\n\n   then, sort the array a(1:m).\n\n   then, set m to the new count (but after sorting, the count remains m).\n\n   Wait, but after modding, some elements could become zero again. Wait, no, because mod by min_val (which is the minimum, so min_val is the smallest element, so mod by it can't be zero unless the element is a multiple of min_val. For example, if the element is min_val itself, mod is zero. So after modding, some elements may become zero again.\n\n   Wait, but in the next step, after modding, we have to sort the array again, but before that, we need to process the modded elements.\n\n   Wait, in the Java code, after modding, the elements are left as they are, then the list is sorted again. So in the next iteration of the main loop, the zeros will be removed again.\n\n   So in the Fortran code, after modding, we need to sort the array again, but before that, we can check for any element that modded to 1.\n\n   So the steps are:\n\n   After step 1 (remove zeros, m is the count):\n\n   if m ==0 \u2192 output 0 and exit.\n\n   find min_val (the minimum of a(1:m)).\n\n   then, for each element in a(1:m):\n\n      new_val = mod(a(i), min_val)\n\n      if new_val ==1 \u2192 output 1 and exit.\n\n      a(i) = new_val\n\n   then, sort the array a(1:m).\n\n   then, m remains the same (since we didn't remove zeros yet, but after sorting, the zeros will be handled in the next iteration's step 1.\n\n   Wait, but in the next iteration, step 1 will remove zeros again.\n\n   So in the Fortran code, the processing steps for each iteration of the main loop (while m >1):\n\n   1. Remove zeros \u2192 m is updated.\n\n   2. if m ==0 \u2192 output 0 and exit.\n\n   3. find min_val.\n\n   4. process each element with mod, check for 1.\n\n   5. sort the array.\n\n   Wait, but in the Java code, the mod is done before the sort. So in Fortran, after modding, the array is sorted again.\n\n   So the steps are correct.\n\n   Now, putting this into code.\n\n   Let me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   If n ==1:\n\n      read the number, output it, and proceed to the second program.\n\n   Else:\n\n      read the array a of size n.\n\n      check if all elements are zero \u2192 if yes, output 0 and proceed to second program.\n\n      else:\n\n          m = n\n\n          do while (m >1)\n\n              ! Step 1: remove zeros\n\n              new_m =0\n\n              do i=1, m\n\n                  if (a(i) /=0) then\n\n                      new_m = new_m +1\n\n                      a(new_m) = a(i)\n\n                  end if\n\n              end do\n\n              m = new_m\n\n              if (m ==0) then\n\n                  write(*,*) 0\n\n                  ! but need to exit to the second program?\n\n                  ! Wait, in the first Java program, this would exit, so in the Fortran code, we need to break and proceed to the second part.\n\n                  ! So in this case, the first program's output is 0, so we can set ans =0 and break.\n\n                  ans =0\n\n                  exit\n\n              end if\n\n              ! Step 2: find min_val\n\n              min_val = a(1)\n\n              do i=2, m\n\n                  if (a(i) < min_val) min_val = a(i)\n\n              end do\n\n              ! Step 3: process each element, mod by min_val, check for 1\n\n              do i=1, m\n\n                  new_val = mod(a(i), min_val)\n\n                  if (new_val ==1) then\n\n                      ans =1\n\n                      ! exit all loops and proceed to second program\n\n                      exit\n\n                  end if\n\n                  a(i) = new_val\n\n              end do\n\n              ! Check if any element was 1 \u2192 if so, break\n\n              if (ans ==1) exit\n\n              ! Step 4: sort the array\n\n              call sort(a(1:m))\n\n              ! Now, m remains the same (since we didn't remove zeros again yet)\n\n          end do\n\n          ! After loop, if ans is not set (i.e., not 1), then the answer is a(1)\n\n          if (ans /=1) then\n\n              ans = a(1)\n\n          end if\n\n   Then, after this first part, the ans is the first program's output.\n\n   Now, moving to the second program's processing.\n\n   The second program takes the ans (integer) as input x.\n\n   The second program's output is 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\n   So:\n\n   x = ans\n\n   if (x ==1) then\n\n       second_output =0\n\n   else\n\n       second_output =1\n\n   end if\n\n   Then, the third program takes the second_output as a string input.\n\n   The third program's input is a string (the second_output's output, which is either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\n   The third program counts uppercase and lowercase letters in the string. Since the input is a single character (either '0' or '1'), which are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters, so uppercase and lowercase counts are both 0. Therefore, the third program will output the lowercase version, which is the same as the input.\n\n   Wait, the third program's code:\n\n   The input is a string. For each character, if uppercase, increment uppercase count, else lowercase (including digits and others? Wait, in Java, Character.isUpperCase checks if the character is an uppercase letter. Digits are not letters, so they are considered lowercase? No, the method returns false for digits, so they are counted in lowercase? Or no, the code increments lowercase only if it's not uppercase. So for a digit, it's not uppercase, so it increments lowercase.\n\n   Wait, in the third Java program's code:\n\n   for each character in the string:\n\n       if Character.isUpperCase(ch) \u2192 uppercase++\n\n       else \u2192 lowercase++\n\n   So digits (like '0' or '1') are considered as lowercase? Because they are not uppercase letters.\n\n   So for input \"0\", the lowercase count is 1, uppercase 0. So the output is lowercase \u2192 \"0\".\n\n   Similarly for \"1\" \u2192 output \"1\".\n\n   So the third program's output is the same as the input string.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is the string representation of the second program's output (0 or 1).\n\n   So the third program's output is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\n   Read the input for the first program.\n\n   Compute the first program's output (ans).\n\n   Compute the second program's output (second_output).\n\n   The third program's input is the string representation of second_output, so the output is the same as second_output's value as a string.\n\n   So the final output is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n   Wait, but the third program's code would process the input string. For example, if the second_output is 0, then the third program's input is \"0\", which is a single character. The code counts uppercase and lowercase letters. Since '0' is not a letter, uppercase is 0, lowercase is 1. So the output is lowercase \u2192 \"0\".\n\n   So the third program's output is the same as the input string. So the final output is the string representation of the second program's output.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program can be written as:\n\n   Read the first program's input, compute ans.\n\n   Compute second_output = 0 if ans is 1 else 1.\n\n   Then, print second_output as a string.\n\n   Wait, but the third program's output is exactly the same as the second's output as a string. So the final output is just the second's output as a string.\n\n   Therefore, the entire process can be simplified to:\n\n   The final output is the string \"0\" if the first program's output is 1, else \"1\".\n\n   Wait, let me confirm:\n\n   First program's output is ans.\n\n   Second program's output is 0 if ans is 1, else 1.\n\n   Third program's output is the string representation of that second output.\n\n   So yes, the final output is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute ans, then compute the second's output, then print it as a string.\n\n   So putting it all together:\n\n   The steps are:\n\n   1. Read n and the list.\n\n   2. Compute ans as per first program.\n\n   3. Compute second_output = 0 if ans ==1 else 1.\n\n   4. Print second_output as a string.\n\n   So the third program's processing is redundant here, but according to the problem statement, we must chain all three programs. However, in this case, the third program's output is exactly the same as the second's output as a string, so we can just output the second's result as a string.\n\n   Now, implementing this in Fortran.\n\n   Let's start coding.\n\n   First, the first part's code.\n\n   We need to read n, then read n integers into an array.\n\n   Then process as per the algorithm.\n\n   Let's outline the code:\n\n   program main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, m, min_val, ans, second_output\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\n   !

Step 4: sort the array\n\n               call sort(a(1:m))\n\n           end do\n\n           if (ans ==0) then\n\n               ans = a(1)\n\n           end if\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Second program's processing\n\n   if (ans ==1) then\n\n       second_output =0\n\n   else\n\n       second_output =1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Third program's processing: output as string\n\n   write(*,'(i0)') second_output\n\n   end program main\n\n   Wait, but the sorting part needs to be implemented. Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function, so I need to write a sorting subroutine.\n\n   Alternatively, use a simple bubble sort for the array.\n\n   Let me add a sorting subroutine.\n\n   Also, in the code above, after the first part's processing, the array a is being modified, but since we are using an array of size n, and m is the current count, the sorting needs to sort the first m elements.\n\n   So here's the code with a sorting subroutine.\n\n   Let me adjust the code:\n\n   program main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, m, min_val, ans, second_output\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\n   !

The sorting subroutine is called with the current m elements.\n\n   Also, in the case where ans is set to 1 (due to mod resulting in 1), the loop exits, and the ans remains 1.\n\n   Now, testing this code with an example.\n\n   Let's take the first example where the input is 3 4 6 8.\n\n   The first program's output should be 2 (the GCD).\n\n   Then the second program's output is 1 (since 2 !=1 \u2192 1).\n\n   The third program's output is \"1\".\n\n   So the final output is 1.\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   The code would process the array [4,6,8].\n\n   After first iteration:\n\n   Step 1: no zeros \u2192 m remains 3.\n\n   min_val is 4.\n\n   Processing each element:\n\n   4 mod4 \u21920 \u2192 stored.\n\n   6 mod4 \u21922 \u2192 stored.\n\n   8 mod4 \u21920 \u2192 stored.\n\n   So the array becomes [0,2,0].\n\n   Then, step 4: sort \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\n   Then, in the next iteration of the main loop (m is now 3? Wait, after step 1 in the next loop:\n\n   The array after mod is [0,2,0], then step 1 (remove zeros):\n\n   new_m is 1 (only the 2 remains).\n\n   So m becomes 1 \u2192 loop exits.\n\n   So ans is a(1) =2.\n\n   So second_output is 1 \u2192 output is \"1\".\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another test case: input 1 5 \u2192 first program outputs 5 \u2192 second outputs 0 \u2192 third outputs \"0\".\n\n   Another case: input 2 1 2 \u2192 first program's processing:\n\n   Initial list [1,2].\n\n   Step 1: no zeros \u2192 m=2.\n\n   min_val is 1.\n\n   Processing elements:\n\n   1 mod1 \u21920 \u2192 stored.\n\n   2 mod1 \u21920 \u2192 stored.\n\n   So array becomes [0,0].\n\n   Step 4: sort \u2192 [0,0].\n\n   Next iteration:\n\n   Step 1: remove zeros \u2192 m=0 \u2192 ans=0.\n\n   So second_output is 1 (since 0 !=1 \u2192 1).\n\n   Wait, but the first program's output is 0, so second_output is 1.\n\n   Third program outputs \"1\".\n\n   But according to the first program's code, if the list after processing becomes all zeros, then it outputs 0.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   Another case where mod results in 1:\n\n   Input 2 3 4 \u2192 first program's steps:\n\n   Initial list [3,4].\n\n   min_val is 3.\n\n   3 mod3 \u21920.\n\n   4 mod3 \u21921 \u2192 which triggers ans=1.\n\n   So the first program's output is 1 \u2192 second program outputs 0 \u2192 third outputs \"0\".\n\n   So the code should handle that.\n\n   Now, the code's sorting subroutine uses a simple bubble sort, which is O(n^2), but for the problem's constraints, it should be okay.\n\n   Also, in the first part's code, after the initial check for all zeros, the code proceeds to process the array.\n\n   Edge case when n=1 and the number is 1 \u2192 first program outputs 1 \u2192 second outputs 0 \u2192 third outputs \"0\".\n\n   All seems correct.\n\n   So this should be the correct Fortran code."
