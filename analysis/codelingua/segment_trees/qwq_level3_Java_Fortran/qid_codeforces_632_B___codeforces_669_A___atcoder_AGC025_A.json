    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_632_B). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers, followed by a string s. It calculates a sum based on 'B's in the string, then does some more calculations with 'A's and 'B's to find the maximum value. The output is the maximum value ans.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n and computes (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder when divided by 3. Wait, actually, the code says (n/3)*2 + (if n mod 3 is 0 then 0 else 1). So for example, if n is 4, 4/3 is 1, mod is 1, so 2 +1 =3. Hmm, but the code's solve function is called with n from the first program's output? Wait, no, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is input to the third. Wait, but the second program's main reads n from input, which would be the first program's output. Then the second program's output is passed to the third program's input. So the third program's input is the second's output.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's input is the user's input, then its output is the input to the second Java program, whose output is input to the third. The final output is the third's output. So in the Fortran program, I need to read the input once (the first program's input), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and then output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, array a, string s).\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans).\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's n, compute its result.\n4. Use that result as the input to the third program's N, compute its final answer.\n5. Output that final answer.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first program's input (n, array a, string s).\n- Compute the first program's ans.\n- Then compute the second program's result using that ans as n.\n- Then compute the third program's result using the second's result as N.\n- Finally, print the third's result.\n\nNow, let's break down each Java program's logic into steps.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_632_B):\n\n- Read n, then array a of size n, then string s.\n- Compute sum as sum of a[i] where s[i] is 'B'.\n- Then compute ans as the maximum between sum, and some other values. Wait, let me retrace:\n\nThe code first initializes sum as the sum of a[i] for B's. Then sum1 is initialized to sum. Then, for each character in s from left to right:\n\nIf the character is 'A', add a[i] to sum1, else subtract. Then update ans with the max of ans and sum1.\n\nThen, reset sum1 to sum again, and do the same but from the end (right to left), again updating ans each time.\n\nSo the first program's ans is the maximum of all these possibilities.\n\nSecond program (codeforces_669_A):\n\nThe solve function takes n and returns (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod 3 !=0 else 0). Wait, let me see:\n\nThe code says (n /3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1). So for example, n=3: 1*2 +0=2. n=4: 1*2 +1=3. n=5: 1*2+1=3. n=6: 2*2 +0=4. So the formula is floor division by 3, multiply by 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder.\n\nThird program (atcoder_AGC025_A):\n\nIt takes N as input. Then computes n as N//2 if even, else (N+1)/2. Then computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then loops A from 1 to n, checking if the sum of digits of A and N-A is smaller than current ans, and updates ans accordingly. The final ans is printed.\n\nWait, the function sum(a) is the sum of digits of a until it's a single digit? Wait no, the code's sum function is:\n\ndef sum(a):\n    ans =0\n    while a >=10:\n        ans += a%10\n        a = a//10\n    ans +=a\n    return ans\n\nWait, no. Wait, the loop continues while a is >=10. So for example, if a is 123, first iteration: a%10 is 3, add to ans. a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12 >=10: add 2 (12%10=2?), wait no, 12 mod10 is 2, so ans +=2, a becomes 1. Then loop ends, add a (1) to ans. So total 3+2+1=6? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the code's sum function:\n\nInitialize ans=0.\n\nWhile a >=10:\n\nTake a mod10 (the last digit), add to ans, then divide a by 10.\n\nOnce a is less than 10, add it to ans.\n\nWait, so for a=123:\n\nFirst iteration: a is 123 >=10: ans +=3 (123 mod10 is 3), a becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: a=12 >=10: ans +=2 (12 mod10 is 2), a becomes 1.\n\nNow a is 1 <10, so add 1 to ans. Total ans is 3+2+1=6.\n\nWait, but the function's name is sum, but it's actually the sum of digits until the number is a single digit? Wait no, the function is summing all digits except the last one? Wait no, the code adds all digits except the last digit in each step? Wait no, the code adds the last digit each time, then divides a by 10. So for 123, the digits are 1,2,3. Wait, no, the first mod10 gives 3 (the last digit), then a becomes 12. Then mod10 gives 2 (the last digit of 12 is 2), then a becomes 1. Then add 1. So total 3+2+1=6. So the function is the sum of all digits of a. Wait, but the loop is while a >=10. Wait, the loop stops when a is less than 10. So the remaining a is added once. So the total is the sum of all digits. Because each digit is added in each step. So the function sum(a) returns the sum of the digits of a.\n\nWait, for example, a= 999: 9+9+9 =27. The function would do 999 mod10 is 9, add to ans (ans=9), a becomes 99. Then again mod10 gives 9, ans becomes 18, a=9. Then add 9, total 27. So yes, the function returns the sum of all digits of a.\n\nWait, but the code's function is called sum, but in the code, the function is named sum. So the third program's problem is to find the minimal sum of digits of A and (N-A), where A ranges from 1 to N/2 (or (N+1)/2 if N is odd). The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then for each A from 1 to n (where n is N//2 if even, else (N+1)/2), compute sum(A) + sum(N-A) and track the minimum.\n\nWait, the code's N is the input. The variable n is set to N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2. So for N even, n=N/2. For odd, n=(N+1)/2. So the loop runs A from 1 to n. The minimal sum is found between all possible A and N-A pairs where A <= N/2 (rounded up). Because for A and N-A, once A exceeds N/2, it's redundant since N-A would be smaller than A. So the loop only needs to check up to that point.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must combine all three steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input for the first program. The first program's input is:\n\nn (integer), then n integers (the array a), then a string s (without any whitespace, since it's read via sc.next(), which reads the next token. Wait, in Java, sc.nextInt() reads the next integer, then sc.next() would read the next token (the string s). So the input for the first program is:\n\nFirst line: n followed by the n integers, then the string s on the same line? Or maybe the string is on the next line? Because in Java, after reading n and the array, the next token is read via sc.next(), which would be the next token. So the input format for the first program is:\n\nLine 1: n followed by n integers (space-separated), then the next line (or same line) has the string s. Or perhaps the string is on the same line after the integers. For example, if the input is like:\n\n3 5 6 7 ABC\n\nThen n is 3, a is [5,6,7], s is \"ABC\".\n\nBut in any case, the Fortran program must read the first program's input correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from stdin can be done with read(*,*) for numbers, but strings are a bit trickier. Since the string s can have any characters (but in the problem, it's a string of 'A's and 'B's), we can read it as a character array.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran program step by step.\n\nFirst, read the first program's input:\n\nRead n, then the array a of size n, then the string s.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the input for the first part would be:\n\nRead the first line: n, then n integers, then the string s. But in Fortran, reading strings can be done with a character array. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the input is structured as:\n\nFirst line: n followed by the n integers, then the string s on the same line. Or perhaps the string is on the next line. Since in Java, the first program uses sc.nextInt() for n and the array, then sc.next() for s. So the string s is the next token after the array. So the input would be like:\n\nn a1 a2 ... an s\n\nAll on the same line, separated by spaces. So in Fortran, we can read n, then the array, then the string.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading a string with spaces is tricky. Since the string s is read as a single token (without spaces), so in Fortran, we can read it as a character array of sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is on the next line. Let me think. The Java code for the first program reads n, then the array, then sc.next() which would read the next token. So if the input is:\n\n3 1 2 3\n\nABCD\n\nThen the first line has n and the array, and the second line is the string. So in Fortran, we can read the first line as n and the array, then read the next line as the string.\n\nAlternatively, the input could have the string on the same line as the array. So the code must handle that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the safest way is to read the first line as n, then the array, then read the string from the next line. But to be precise, perhaps the first program's input is:\n\nFirst line: n followed by n integers (space-separated).\n\nSecond line: the string s (without any leading/trailing spaces, since sc.next() would read until the next whitespace).\n\nSo in Fortran, the code can read the first line with read(*,*) n, then read the array, then read the string from the next line.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading the array can be done with a loop. Let me think of the steps.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n integers into an array a.\n\nThen read the string s.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would be something like:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nWait, but the string may be of variable length. So perhaps using a character array of sufficient length, say 1e5 or something. Alternatively, read the entire line as a string and then process it. But for simplicity, assuming that the string is on the next line, and the length is manageable.\n\nOnce the first part's input is read, compute the first program's ans.\n\nThen, use that ans as the input to the second program's n, compute its result (let's call it second_result).\n\nThen, use second_result as the input to the third program's N, compute the third's ans, and output that.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_632_B):\n\nVariables needed:\n\nn, a array, s string.\n\nCompute sum as sum of a[i] where s(i) is 'B'.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for the first sum is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'B') sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the string s is 1-based, so s(1) is the first character. The array a is 1-based. So for i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\nif s(i) == 'B', add a(i) to sum.\n\nWait, but in Java, the array a has length n, and the string s has length n? Because in the Java code, the for loop for the array is for i from 0 to n-1, and the string s is read, but the code loops over s's length. Wait, the code may have a problem if the string's length is not equal to n. But assuming that the input is correct, so in the Fortran code, we can assume that the length of s is equal to n.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the code reads the array a of size n, then reads the string s. The code then loops over s's length, which may be different from n. But the problem probably expects that the string's length is exactly n. So in Fortran, we can assume that the length of s is n.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop for the first sum is over s.length(), so if the string is longer than n, then the a array may not have enough elements. But the problem's input is correct, so we can proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n        sum = sum + a(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, compute ans as the maximum between sum and the other possibilities.\n\nThen, the next part is the first loop for the 'A's and 'B's:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nans = sum\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n        sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n    else\n\n        sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n    end if\n\n    if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n        ans = sum1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second loop from the end:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n    if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n        sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n    else\n\n        sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n    end if\n\n    if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n        ans = sum1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the first part's computation.\n\nSecond part (codeforces_669_A):\n\nThe input is the first program's ans, which is an integer. The output is (ans /3)*2 + 1 if ans mod3 !=0 else 0.\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but in Fortran, if both operands are integers, it does integer division (floor division). So for example, 4/3 is 1, 5/3 is 1, 6/3 is 2.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nsecond_result = (ans /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(ans,3) /=0 )\n\nWait, mod(ans,3) gives the remainder. So if mod is 0, add 0, else add 1.\n\nThird part (atcoder_AGC025_A):\n\nThe input is the second_result (N). Compute the minimal sum of digits of A and (N - A), where A ranges from 1 to n, where n is N//2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nFirst, compute N = second_result.\n\nCompute n:\n\nif mod(N,2) ==0 then\n\n    n = N/2\n\nelse\n\n    n = (N+1)/2\n\nend if\n\nThen compute the initial ans as sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\nif current_sum < ans then ans = current_sum\n\nFinally, output ans.\n\nThe sum_digits function is needed. Let's code that as a function.\n\nFunction sum_digits(a) result(res)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: a\n\n    integer :: res, temp\n\n    res =0\n\n    temp = a\n\n    do while (temp >=10)\n\n        res = res + mod(temp,10)\n\n        temp = temp /10\n\n    end do\n\n    res = res + temp\n\nend function sum_digits\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be written as internal functions or external. Since this is a single program, perhaps we can define it as an internal function.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead the first program's input (n, a array, s string).\n\nCompute first_ans (ans from first program).\n\nCompute second_result = (first_ans /3)*2 + (1 if mod(first_ans,3)/=0 else 0).\n\nCompute third_ans using second_result as N.\n\nOutput third_ans.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n, a array, s string.\n\nThen compute first_ans.\n\nThen compute second_result.\n\nThen compute third_ans.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, first_ans, second_result, third_ans\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n\n    !

But in some cases, if the string is on the next line, that's okay. But in the first Java program, the string is read via sc.next(), which reads the next token. So if the input after the array is on the same line, then the Fortran code's read(*,*) a(1:n) would read until the end of the line, and then the next read would read the string from the next line. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n3 5 6 7\n\nABCD\n\nThen the first read(*,*) n reads 3.\n\nThen read a(1:3) would read 5,6,7 from the next line (since the first line after n is the array). Wait, no, the first line after n is the array. Wait, the first line is n followed by the array elements. So the first read(*,*) n reads the first number. Then the next read(*,*) a(1:n) reads the next numbers (the array elements). Then the next read reads the string from the next line.\n\nAlternatively, if the input is all on one line:\n\n3 5 6 7 ABCD\n\nThen the first read(*,*) n reads 3, then the array read reads 5,6,7, and then the next read would read the remaining part (ABCD) as the string. But in Fortran, the read(*,*) a(1:n) would read the next 3 integers (5,6,7), and the remaining 'ABCD' would be left in the input buffer. Then the next read for the string would read 'ABCD' as the string. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading with read(*,*) a(1:n), it reads until the end of the list. So if the line has more elements after the array, those would be left, and the next read would pick them up. So the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue is the length of the string. The s is declared as len=100000, which should be sufficient for the problem's constraints.\n\nAnother thing: in the first function compute_first, the length of s is len_trim(s). But in the Java code, the loop runs over s.length(), which is the actual length of the string. So in Fortran, using len_trim(s) is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first program:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 1 2 3\n\nBAB\n\nThen s is \"BAB\".\n\nsum_val is B at positions 1 and 3 (indices 1 and 3 in Fortran, since 1-based). So sum_val =1+3=4.\n\nThen the first loop (left to right):\n\ni=1: 'B' \u2192 subtract? Wait, no. Wait in the first loop after sum_val is initialized, the code for the first loop (the first for loop after sum1 = sum_val):\n\nWait, in the first loop (the first for loop after initializing sum1 to sum_val):\n\nfor each character in s (from left to right):\n\nif 'A', add a[i], else subtract.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (s(i) == 'A') then add a[i], else subtract.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, no, in the first loop after sum1 = sum_val (which is the initial sum of B's):\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program's first loop after the initial sum:\n\nWait, the code after the first sum is:\n\nsum1 = sum;\n\nans = sum;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, so for each character in s, starting from the first, we add a[i] if 'A', subtract if 'B', and track the maximum.\n\nWait, in the example above, s is \"BAB\".\n\nIndices 0-based in Java:\n\ni=0: 'B' \u2192 subtract a[0] (1) \u2192 sum1 =4 (initial) -1 =3 \u2192 ans is max(4,3) \u2192 remains 4.\n\ni=1: 'A' \u2192 add a[1] (2) \u2192 sum1=3+2=5 \u2192 ans becomes 5.\n\ni=2: 'B' \u2192 subtract a[2] (3) \u2192 sum1=5-3=2 \u2192 ans remains 5.\n\nThen the first loop's ans is 5.\n\nThen the second loop (from the end):\n\nsum1 is reset to 4.\n\nLoop from i=2 downto 0 (Java's for (i = s.length()-1; i >=0; i--)).\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is from len_s downto 1.\n\nFor the example:\n\nlen_s is 3 (since \"BAB\" is 3 characters).\n\ni=3 (Java's i=2):\n\ns(3) is 'B' \u2192 subtract a(3) (3). sum1 starts at 4 \u2192 4-3=1. ans is still 5.\n\ni=2 (Java's i=1):\n\ns(2) is 'A' \u2192 add a(2)=2 \u2192 sum1 becomes 1+2=3 \u2192 ans remains 5.\n\ni=1 (Java's i=0):\n\ns(1) is 'B' \u2192 subtract a(1)=1 \u2192 sum1=3-1=2 \u2192 ans still 5.\n\nSo the final ans is 5.\n\nSo the first program's output is 5.\n\nThen the second program takes 5 as input.\n\nSecond program's calculation: (5//3)*2 + (1 if mod(5,3)!=0 \u2192 yes, mod is 2 \u2192 so 1). So (1)*2 +1 =3.\n\nThen the third program takes 3 as N.\n\nThird program's N is 3.\n\nCompute n: since 3 is odd, n=(3+1)/2=2.\n\nInitial ans is sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(2).\n\nsum_digits(1) is 1, sum_digits(2) is 2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 2.\n\nA=1:\n\nsum_digits(1) + sum_digits(2) \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 same as current ans \u2192 no change.\n\nA=2:\n\nsum_digits(2) + sum_digits(1) \u2192 same as before \u2192 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3. So the third program's output is 3.\n\nThus, the final output is 3.\n\nTesting the code with this input should give 3.\n\nAnother test case for the third program:\n\nSuppose N=4.\n\nSecond program's output would be (4/3)*2 +1 \u2192 1*2+1=3.\n\nWait, no, 4 mod3 is 1, so yes, so 3.\n\nWait, N=4 in third program:\n\nN=4.\n\nn is 4/2=2.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1)+sum(3) \u2192 1 + (3 \u2192 sum is 3 \u2192 total 4.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 2.\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(3)=1+3=4 \u2192 same as initial.\n\nA=2: sum(2) + sum(2) \u2192 2+2=4 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better split?\n\nWait, the minimal is 4. So the code would output 4.\n\nHmm, but let's see another example.\n\nWait, perhaps N=9.\n\nSecond program's input is first program's output, but let's skip that and focus on third.\n\nN=9:\n\nn is (9+1)/2=5 (since 9 is odd).\n\nInitial ans is sum(1) + sum(8) \u2192 1 + (8 \u2192 sum is 8 \u2192 total 9.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 5.\n\nA=4: 4 \u2192 sum is 4, 9-4=5 \u2192 sum is5 \u2192 total 9.\n\nA=5: sum(5)=5, 4 \u2192 sum4 \u2192 total 9.\n\nWait, but maybe A=9//2=4.5 \u2192 4 or 5.\n\nWait, the minimal could be when A=9, but that's beyond the loop.\n\nWait, perhaps A=9 is not considered since n is 5 (since (9+1)/2=5). So the loop runs up to 5.\n\nWait, the minimal could be when A=9, but that's not in the loop. Wait, but the loop is up to n=5, so A=5 gives 5 and 4 \u2192 sum 9.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better split. Let's see:\n\nLooking for A and 9-A where their digit sums are minimal.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nA=9 \u2192 9 and 0 \u2192 but 0 is not allowed (since A must be between 1 and 8).\n\nWait, the problem's code for the third program starts A from 1 to N/2 (rounded up). So for N=9, the maximum A is 5 (since (9+1)/2=5).\n\nSo possible pairs:\n\nA=5 \u2192 5 and 4 \u2192 sum 5+4=9.\n\nA=4 \u21924 and5 \u2192 same.\n\nA=3 \u21923 and6 \u2192 3+6=9.\n\nA=2 \u21922 and7 \u21922+7=9.\n\nA=1 \u21921 and8 \u21921+8=9.\n\nSo the minimal is 9. So the code would output 9.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a better split. Let's see:\n\nWait, what about A=9? Not allowed since A can't exceed N/2 (5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A= 99? No, N is 9.\n\nHmm, so the code works correctly here.\n\nAnother test case for third program: N=10.\n\nSecond program's output would be (10/3)*2 +0 \u2192 3*2=6.\n\nWait, N=10 in third program:\n\nn is 10/2=5.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1)+sum(9) \u21921 +9=10.\n\nLoop A from 1 to5.\n\nA=5 \u21925 and5 \u21925+5=10.\n\nA=9 is not in the loop.\n\nWait, but maybe A=9 is not considered. Wait, the maximum A is 5.\n\nWait, but perhaps A=5 gives 5+5=10.\n\nWait, but what about A=10? Not allowed.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a better split. Let's see:\n\nLooking for A and 10-A where their digit sums are minimal.\n\nPossible A=5 \u21925 and5 \u219210.\n\nA=9 \u21929 and1 \u21929+1=10.\n\nA=1 \u21921 and9 \u2192 same.\n\nA=10 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nHmm, so the minimal is 10.\n\nAlternatively, A= 10's half is 5, so the code's answer is correct.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the function compute_third is written with the sum_digits function inside it. That should be okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the third function, the loop variable A is from 1 to n. The loop is written as do A=1, n.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
