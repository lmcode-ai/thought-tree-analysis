    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_25_A) reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It counts the number of even and odd numbers, and keeps track of the last index where each occurred. Then it outputs the index of the minority (if there are more odds, it outputs the even index, and vice versa). Wait, actually, looking at the code: the loop goes from 1 to n, so for each element, if even, it increments even and stores the current index. So the even_ind and odd_ind will hold the last occurrence of even or odd. Then, if odd count is greater than even, it prints even_ind (the position of the single even in that case), else the odd's position. So the output is the index (1-based) of the unique even or odd, whichever is fewer. So the first program's output is an integer which is the index of the differing element.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x. It checks if x is 1, then sets a boolean. Then the result is 0 if x was 1, else 1. Because: if x is 1, bool is true, so !bool is false, so result is 0. If x is not 1, then result is 1. So the second program's output is 1 if the input is not 1, else 0. Wait, let me check the code again. The code says:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false; // so bool is true when x is 1.\n\nThen result is !bool ? 1 : 0. So if !bool is true (i.e., bool is false, so x !=1), then result is 1. Else (x is 1), result is 0. So yes, exactly as I thought. So the second program's output is 1 if input is not 1, else 0.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC169_D) takes a long n, computes its square root, then factors it. The code is a bit more complex. Let me see:\n\nThe code loops from i=2 to sqrt(n). For each i, it divides n by i as much as possible, counting how many times (count). Then, for each j from 1 upwards, subtract j from count until count -j is negative. The number of steps here is added to the answer. Wait, the inner loop is for j=1 to ... until count -j >=0? Wait, the inner loop is written as for (int j=1; count -j >=0; j++) { count -=j; answer++; }\n\nWait, no, the loop condition is count -j >=0? Wait, the loop is written as for (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) { ... }\n\nWait, the loop runs while count - j is >=0? Wait, no, the condition is checked before each iteration. Let me think: the loop is for (j=1; condition; j++) { ... }\n\nThe condition is count - j >=0. So first iteration j=1: check if count -1 >=0. If yes, then enter loop, subtract j (1) from count, increment answer. Then j increments to 2, check count -2 >=0? Wait, but after the first iteration, count was reduced by j (1). Hmm, perhaps this is a way to compute the maximum number of terms in the sequence 1+2+...+k <= count. Because the inner loop is adding 1 to the answer for each j until the remaining count can't support the next j. Wait, maybe the inner loop is trying to find how many terms can be summed up to reach count. Let me see:\n\nSuppose count is 5. The loop starts with j=1. count -1 >=0 \u2192 yes. So subtract 1 (count becomes 4), answer increases by 1. Then j becomes 2. Now check count (4) -2 >=0 \u2192 yes. Subtract 2 (count becomes 2), answer increases again. j becomes 3. Now 2 -3 is negative \u2192 loop stops. So total added 2. Wait, but 1+2=3 which is less than 5. Hmm, maybe the inner loop is counting how many steps you can take where each step takes j, starting from 1, until you can't take the next j. The total steps would be the maximum k where 1+2+...+k \u2264 count. Because each step j takes j from the count. So the total steps is the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. The inner loop's answer increments by 1 each time, so the total added to answer is k. So for count=5, the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22645 is 2 (since 3*4/2=6>5). So the inner loop adds 2 to the answer. \n\nWait, let me see for count=3: 1+2=3 \u2192 k=2. So the loop would run for j=1 (count becomes 2, answer+1), then j=2 (count becomes 0, answer+1 again). Then j=3: 0-3 is negative, so loop stops. So total 2 added. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the inner loop is effectively finding the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count, and adding that k to the answer. \n\nThe outer loop does this for each prime factor i (since it's dividing n by i until it can't, so i is a prime factor?), but actually, the code is not checking for primes. It's just trying all i from 2 to sqrt(n). Wait, but the code is not checking if i is a factor. Wait, the code first checks if n is divisible by i. The while loop runs as long as n%i ==0. So for each i, it's taking all exponents of i in the prime factorization. So the code is factorizing n into primes, but the way the inner loop is structured, for each prime factor (i) with exponent count, it adds the maximum k such that k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. \n\nWait, but the code is looping over i from 2 to sqrt(n), and for each i, it divides n by i as much as possible, so that's the exponent count for that prime. Then, for each such exponent, it calculates how many terms in the triangular numbers sum up to that exponent. \n\nWait, the problem might be to compute the number of ways to represent the exponents as sums of consecutive integers starting from 1. Or perhaps the problem is to compute the number of exponents in the prime factors, but I'm not sure. The third program's output is the sum of these k's for each prime factor, plus 1 if the remaining n (after all factors up to sqrt(n)) is a prime greater than 1. \n\nWait, the code after the loop checks if n>1, then adds 1. So that's for the case where after dividing by all factors up to sqrt(n), there's a remaining prime factor larger than sqrt(n). So that's handled by adding 1. \n\nSo the third program's output is the sum over all prime factors (with their exponents) of the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 exponent, plus 1 if there's a remaining prime factor. \n\nNow, the three Java programs are run in sequence. The output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third. \n\nSo the first program's output is an integer (the index). Let's call that value A. The second program takes A as input, and outputs 1 if A !=1, else 0. Let's call that B. The third program takes B as input, and computes the answer based on B. \n\nWait, but B can only be 0 or 1. Let's see:\n\nIf the first program's output is 1, then the second program outputs 0. Then the third program takes 0 as input. \n\nWait, but the third program expects a long n. So if the input is 0, then sqrt(0) is 0, so the loop from 2 to 0 doesn't run. Then, since n is 0, the code would check if n>1? No, so the answer is 0. So the third program would output 0. \n\nAlternatively, if the first program's output is something else (like 2), then the second program outputs 1, so the third program takes 1 as input. Let's see what happens when n=1. The sqrt is 1, so the loop from 2 to 1 doesn't run. Then, since n is 1, the code doesn't add anything, and since n is not >1, so the answer is 0. So the third program would output 0. \n\nWait, but let's see for B=1: the third program's input is 1. The code would compute sqrt(1) =1. The loop runs from 2 to 1, which doesn't execute. Then, since n is 1, the final check (n>1) is false, so answer remains 0. So the third program's output is 0. \n\nIf B is 0, then the third program's input is 0. The loop from 2 to 0 doesn't run. The final check (n>1) is false, so answer is 0. \n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is something else? Let's see, for example, if the first program outputs 3. Then the second program would output 1 (since 3 !=1). Then the third program's input is 1, which gives 0. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The second program's output is 1 when the input is not 1. So if the first program's output is any number except 1, the second program outputs 1, leading to the third program's input being 1, which gives 0. The only case where the second program outputs 0 is when the first program's output is 1. Then the third program's input is 0, which also gives 0. \n\nWait, so in all cases, the third program's output is 0? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the third program's code. Let me re-examine it.\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nlong n = scanner.nextLong();\n\nThen, sqrt is (int) Math.sqrt(n). \n\nThen, for each i from 2 to sqrt(n), inclusive:\n\ncount is the exponent of i in the prime factors. \n\nThen, for each j from 1 upwards, while count -j >=0, subtract j from count and add 1 to answer. \n\nWait, the inner loop is:\n\nfor (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) {\n\n    count -=j;\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nfor (int j=1; count - j >=0; j++) {\n\n    count -= j;\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop condition is checked before each iteration. Let me see for count=3:\n\nFirst iteration j=1: count -1 >=0 \u2192 yes. Subtract 1 \u2192 count becomes 2. answer increases by 1.\n\nThen j increments to 2. Now, count (2) -2 >=0 \u2192 yes. Subtract 2 \u2192 count becomes 0. answer increases again (total 2).\n\nj becomes 3. Now, count (0) -3 \u2192 -3 <0 \u2192 loop stops. So total 2 added. \n\nSo for count=3, the inner loop adds 2. \n\nWait, but 1+2=3, so the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22643 is 2 (since 2*3/2=3). So that's correct. \n\nAnother example: count=6. \n\nj=1: subtract 1 \u2192 count=5 \u2192 answer+1 (total 1)\n\nj=2: subtract 2 \u2192 count=3 \u2192 answer+1 (total 2)\n\nj=3: subtract 3 \u2192 count=0 \u2192 answer+1 (total 3)\n\nj=4: 0-4 \u2192 no \u2192 loop stops. So total 3 added. 3*4/2=6, so yes. \n\nSo the inner loop is indeed adding the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. \n\nNow, the third program's output is the sum of all such k's for each prime factor's exponent, plus 1 if the remaining n is a prime (or composite?) greater than 1. \n\nWait, the code says if (n>1) answer++. So after processing all factors up to sqrt(n), if the remaining n is greater than 1, then it adds 1. That would be the case if n has a prime factor larger than sqrt(original n). For example, if original n was a prime number p, then the loop from 2 to sqrt(p) (which is less than p) would not find any factors, so the code would process nothing, then since n is still p (which is >1), so answer +=1. \n\nSo for n=2 (prime), the code would have answer 1. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nn=2. sqrt is 1. So loop from 2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. Then, since n is 2>1 \u2192 answer becomes 1. So output is 1. \n\nAnother example: n=4. \n\nsqrt(4)=2. \n\nLoop i=2:\n\ncount starts at 0. \n\nCheck 4%2 ==0 \u2192 yes. Divide by 2 \u2192 n becomes 2, count=1. Again, 2%2 \u2192 yes, divide again \u2192 n=1, count=2. \n\nNow, the inner loop for count=2:\n\nj=1: count-1 >=0 \u2192 yes. Subtract 1 \u2192 count=1. answer +=1 (now 1).\n\nj=2: count (1) -2 \u2192 -1 \u2192 no. So loop stops. So added 1. \n\nSo the inner loop adds 1. \n\nThen, after the loop, n is 1, so the final check (n>1) is false. So total answer is 1. \n\nSo for n=4, the output is 1. \n\nWait, but let's see another example. Let's take n=6. \n\nOriginal n=6. sqrt is 2.449 \u2192 sqrt cast to int is 2. \n\nLoop i=2:\n\n6%2 ==0 \u2192 yes. Divide by 2 \u2192 n=3, count=1. Again 3%2 \u2192 no. So count is 1. \n\nThen inner loop for count=1:\n\nj=1 \u2192 count-1=0 \u2192 yes. Subtract 1 \u2192 count=0. answer +=1 (now 1). \n\nj=2 \u2192 0-2 \u2192 no. So total 1 added. \n\nThen i=3? Wait, the loop is up to sqrt(6) which is ~2.449 \u2192 so i goes up to 2. So next i is 3? No, the loop is from 2 to 2. \n\nWait, the loop is for (i=2; i<=sqrt; i++). So sqrt is 2 here. So i runs 2 only. \n\nThen, after processing i=2, the remaining n is 3. \n\nThen, since 3>1, the final check adds 1. So total answer is 1 (from i=2) +1 (from remaining 3) \u2192 total 2. \n\nSo the output would be 2. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, the third program's input is B, which is either 0 or 1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nCase 1: first program outputs 1 \u2192 second program outputs 0 \u2192 third program's input is 0. \n\nThird program's processing:\n\nn=0. \n\nsqrt(0) is 0. So the loop from 2 to 0 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nThen, since n is 0, the final check (n>1) is false. So answer is 0. \n\nSo output is 0. \n\nCase 2: first program outputs anything else (so second program outputs 1 \u2192 third program's input is 1. \n\nProcessing n=1:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. Loop from 2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nFinal check: n is 1, so not >1 \u2192 answer remains 0. \n\nSo output is 0. \n\nWait, so in all cases, the third program's output is 0? That can't be right. Wait, but what if the first program's output is 0? Wait, but the first program's output is the index of an element in an array of size n. The index starts at 1, so the first program's output can't be 0. So the first program's output is at least 1. \n\nWait, the first program's output is either the even_ind or odd_ind, which are indices from 1 to n. So the first program's output is between 1 and n. \n\nSo the second program's input is that index. \n\nIf the first program's output is 1, then the second program outputs 0. \n\nElse, the second program outputs 1. \n\nSo the third program's input is either 0 or 1. \n\nIn both cases, the third program's output is 0. \n\nWait, so the entire sequence of programs will always output 0? That seems odd. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's code analysis. Let me check again. \n\nWait, when the third program's input is 0, then n is 0. \n\nThe code's loop runs from i=2 to sqrt(0) \u2192 sqrt(0) is 0. So the loop doesn't run. \n\nThen, the code checks if n>1 \u2192 0>1 is false. So answer remains 0. \n\nSo output is 0. \n\nIf the input is 1, then n=1. \n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The loop runs from 2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nThen, n is 1, so the final check is false. So answer is 0. \n\nSo yes, the third program's output is always 0. \n\nHmm, so the entire sequence of programs will always output 0? That's strange. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me check again. \n\nThe second program's code:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWait, the code is written as:\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false;\n\nThen, result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nSo when x is 1, bool is true \u2192 !bool is false \u2192 so result is 0. \n\nWhen x is not 1, !bool is true \u2192 so result is 1. \n\nSo yes, correct. \n\nSo the third program's input is either 0 or 1, leading to output 0. \n\nSo the entire sequence's final output is 0. \n\nWait, but that's only if the first program's output is 1 or not. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where the first program's output is 1, leading to second output 0 \u2192 third input 0 \u2192 output 0. \n\nOr first program's output is 2 \u2192 second output 1 \u2192 third input 1 \u2192 output 0. \n\nSo in all cases, the final output is 0. \n\nHmm, that's unexpected. But according to the code, that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process all three steps, and output 0. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the third program's code analysis. Let me think of another scenario. \n\nSuppose the first program's output is 2 (so second program outputs 1). The third program's input is 1. \n\nWait, but let's see the third program's code again. \n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nlong n = scanner.nextLong();\n\nThen, the code factors n into primes, and for each exponent, adds the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 exponent. \n\nWait, but when n is 1, the loop over i from 2 to sqrt(1) (which is 1) doesn't run. The remaining n is 1, so the final check (n>1) is false. So the answer is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm, so the entire sequence will always output 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input for the first program, process everything, and output 0. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the first program's input is n=1, array [5]. \n\nThen, the first program's code:\n\nn=1, array[1]=5. \n\nodd count is 1, even count 0. \n\nSo since odd>even, it outputs even_ind (which is 0?), but wait, in the code, even_ind is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nint odd =0, even=0, odd_ind=0, even_ind=0;\n\nThen, for each element, if even, even increments and even_ind =i. \n\nIn the case of n=1, the array[1] is 5 (odd). So the loop runs for i=1. \n\nSince 5 is odd, odd increments to 1, odd_ind=1. \n\nThen, since odd (1) > even (0), it prints even_ind (0). \n\nWait, but the code's output is even_ind, which is 0? But the problem says the indices are 1-based. \n\nWait, the first program's code initializes even_ind and odd_ind to 0. \n\nIn the case where all elements are odd, even_ind remains 0. \n\nSo the first program would output 0? But the problem says the array is of size n+1, but the elements are read from 1 to n. \n\nWait, the first Java program's array is declared as new int[n+1], and the loop is for i from 1 to n. So the indices 1..n are filled. \n\nSo in the case of n=1, the array[1] is set. \n\nIf the element is odd, then even_ind remains 0. \n\nSo the first program would output even_ind (0) in that case. \n\nWait, but the problem says the output is the index of the minority. \n\nWait, in the case of n=1, there's only one element. So the minority is the even (count 0) or odd (count 1). Since even count is 0, which is less than odd count (1), so the code would print even_ind (0). \n\nBut the problem's first program's output is an index, which is 0 here. \n\nBut the second program takes that as input. \n\nWait, but the second program's input is an integer. So if the first program outputs 0, then the second program's input is 0. \n\nThen, the second program's code: \n\nx is 0. \n\nbool = (0 ==1) \u2192 false. \n\nresult = !bool \u2192 true \u2192 so result is 1. \n\nWait, wait, let me recheck:\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nx = 0 \u2192 \n\nbool = (x ==1) \u2192 false. \n\nThen, result = !bool ? 1 : 0 \u2192 since !bool is true \u2192 result is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is 1. \n\nThen the third program's input is 1 \u2192 output is 0. \n\nWait, so in this case, the final output is 0. \n\nAnother example: first program's output is 0 \u2192 second outputs 1 \u2192 third outputs 0. \n\nAnother example: first program's output is 2 \u2192 second outputs 1 \u2192 third outputs 0. \n\nAnother example: first program's output is 1 \u2192 second outputs 0 \u2192 third outputs 0. \n\nSo in all cases, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence of programs will always output 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input for the first program, process everything, and output 0. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code analysis. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the first program's code, the array is 1-based (indices 1 to n). \n\nThe variables even_ind and odd_ind are initialized to 0. \n\nSuppose all elements are even. Then, even count is n, odd count 0. So the code would print odd_ind (0). \n\nWait, but the problem says the output is the index of the minority. \n\nWait, in that case, the minority is the odd count (0), so the code would print the odd's index (0). \n\nBut the problem's first program's output is the index of the minority. \n\nWait, but the problem's first program's code says: \n\nif (odd > even) \u2192 print even_ind (the even's index, which is the minority). \n\nElse \u2192 print odd_ind (the odd's index, which is the minority). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo in the case where all elements are even, the minority is the odd count (0), so the code would print odd_ind (0). \n\nBut the second program would take that 0 as input, leading to output 1 (since 0 !=1 \u2192 result is 1). \n\nThen the third program's input is 1 \u2192 output 0. \n\nSo the final output is 0. \n\nHmm, so regardless of the first program's output, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the first program's input, process everything, and output 0. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some edge case. Let me think of another scenario. \n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0 (like when n=1 and the element is odd). \n\nThen second program's input is 0 \u2192 outputs 1. \n\nThird program's input is 1 \u2192 output 0. \n\nAnother case: first program's output is 0 (from n=2, all even elements). \n\nWait, n=2, array [2,4]. \n\nThen even count is 2, odd count 0. \n\nSo since even count is larger, the code would print odd_ind (0). \n\nSecond program's input is 0 \u2192 outputs 1. \n\nThird program's input is 1 \u2192 output 0. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm, so the final output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the first program's input, process everything, and output 0. \n\nWait, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. \n\nSo the Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process all three steps, and output the final result. \n\nBut according to the analysis, the final result is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the first program's input, do nothing with it, and output 0. \n\nWait, but that's only if the analysis is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's code analysis. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the third program's code: \n\nThe code is for a problem where the input is a number n, and the output is the sum over each prime factor's exponent of the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 exponent, plus 1 if there's a remaining prime factor. \n\nWait, but when the input is 0, the code's answer is 0. \n\nWhen the input is 1, the answer is 0. \n\nWhen the input is 2, the answer is 1. \n\nWait, let me test with input 2. \n\nThird program's input is 2. \n\nsqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 cast to int is 1. \n\nLoop from i=2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nThen, since n is 2>1 \u2192 answer +=1. \n\nSo the output is 1. \n\nAh! Wait, in this case, the third program's output would be 1. \n\nWait, but in the sequence of programs, the third program's input can only be 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the second program's output is either 0 or 1. \n\nSo the third program's input is either 0 or 1. \n\nSo in those cases, the third program's output is 0. \n\nBut if the second program's output was 2, then the third program would output 1. \n\nBut according to the second program's code, it can only output 0 or 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's input is always 0 or 1, leading to output 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the first program's input, process everything, and output 0. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me write the Fortran code step by step. \n\nFirst, the first program's code in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array. \n\nCount the number of even and odd elements, track the last indices. \n\nThen, determine which is the minority and get the index. \n\nThen, pass that index to the second program. \n\nSecond program: take that index (integer), output 1 if it's not 1, else 0. \n\nThird program: take that result (0 or 1), compute the answer as per its code. \n\nBut since the third program's output is 0 in both cases, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input for the first program (n and array), process all steps, and output 0. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program. So I need to code all three steps in Fortran, even if the final result is 0. \n\nSo let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, the first program's logic in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then n integers. \n\nInitialize even and odd counts to 0, even_ind and odd_ind to 0. \n\nLoop over the array elements (indices 1 to n). \n\nFor each element, check if even or odd. \n\nUpdate counts and indices. \n\nThen, determine which is the minority and get the index (even_ind or odd_ind). \n\nThen, pass that index to the second program's logic. \n\nSecond program's logic: \n\nTake the index (call it A). \n\nIf A ==1 \u2192 output 0, else 1. \n\nThen, pass that result (B) to the third program's logic. \n\nThird program's logic: \n\nTake B (0 or 1). \n\nCompute the answer as per its code. \n\nBut since B is 0 or 1, the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and array, compute the first program's output (A), compute B = 0 if A is 1 else 1, then compute the third program's output (which is 0), and print 0. \n\nAlternatively, since the final output is always 0, the code can just output 0 after reading the input. \n\nBut the problem requires that the code must behave identically to the original chain. \n\nTherefore, even if the final result is always 0, the code must process all steps. \n\nSo let's proceed to code each step. \n\nFirst, the first program's part:\n\nRead n, then n integers. \n\nInitialize variables. \n\nThen process the array. \n\nThen compute A (the index). \n\nSecond program's part: compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1. \n\nThird program's part: compute the answer based on B. \n\nBut since B is 0 or 1, the third program's code will output 0. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows. \n\nBut let's code it step by step. \n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. \n\nSo code outline:\n\nRead n. \n\nRead n integers into an array. \n\nInitialize even_count, odd_count, even_ind, odd_ind. \n\nLoop over the array elements (from 1 to n). \n\nFor each element, check if even or odd. \n\nUpdate counts and indices. \n\nCompute A: if odd_count > even_count then even_ind else odd_ind. \n\nCompute B: if A ==1 then 0 else 1. \n\nNow, compute the third program's result. \n\nThird program's input is B. \n\nSo let's code the third program's logic. \n\nThe third program's input is B (0 or 1). \n\nWe need to compute the answer as per the third Java program. \n\nLet me code that part. \n\nThe third program's code steps:\n\nRead n (which is B). \n\nCompute sqrt(n). \n\nInitialize answer to 0. \n\nLoop i from 2 to sqrt(n). \n\nFor each i, count how many times it divides n. \n\nThen, compute the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. \n\nAdd that k to answer. \n\nDivide n by i^count. \n\nAfter all i, if n>1, add 1 to answer. \n\nFinally, print answer. \n\nBut since B is 0 or 1, let's see:\n\nCase B=0:\n\nn=0. \n\nsqrt(0) is 0. \n\nLoop from 2 to 0 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nCheck if n>1 \u2192 0>1 \u2192 no. \n\nAnswer is 0. \n\nCase B=1:\n\nn=1. \n\nsqrt(1) is 1. \n\nLoop from 2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nCheck if n>1 \u2192 1>1 \u2192 no. \n\nAnswer is 0. \n\nThus, the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input for the first program, process everything, and output 0. \n\nBut to comply with the problem's requirement of translating the entire sequence, even if the final result is 0, we need to code all steps. \n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Read n and the array. \n\n2. Process the first program's logic to get A. \n\n3. Compute B from A. \n\n4. Process the third program's logic with B as input. \n\n5. Output the result of the third program. \n\nEven though steps 2-4 can be simplified, we must code them. \n\nNow, coding in Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n, then n integers. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, array(100000) ! assuming n can be up to some limit. \n\nBut since the first Java program uses an array of size n+1, but in the code, the loop is from 1 to n. \n\nWe can read n, then read n integers into an array of size n. \n\nWait, in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be used with allocatable arrays. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem may have n up to some limit, but for code simplicity, perhaps read into an array of sufficient size. \n\nAlternatively, use an array of size 1e5 or similar. \n\nBut for code, let's proceed. \n\nFirst, read n. \n\nThen read n integers. \n\nThen process them. \n\nThen compute A. \n\nThen compute B. \n\nThen compute the third program's result. \n\nNow, coding step by step. \n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n. \n\nThen read n integers into an array. \n\nInitialize even_count, odd_count, even_ind, odd_ind. \n\nLoop over the array elements. \n\nThen compute A. \n\nSecond part: compute B. \n\nThird part: compute the third program's result. \n\nNow, coding the third part. \n\nThe third part's input is B. \n\nWe need to compute the answer as per the third Java program. \n\nLet me code that part. \n\nThe third program's code steps:\n\nRead n (B). \n\nCompute sqrt(n). \n\nInitialize answer to 0. \n\nLoop i from 2 to sqrt(n). \n\nFor each i, count how many times it divides n. \n\nThen compute the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. \n\nAdd that k to answer. \n\nDivide n by i^count. \n\nAfter all i, if n>1, add 1 to answer. \n\nFinally, print answer. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: B, n_third, answer, i, count, sqrt_n, temp\n\nn_third = B\n\nanswer = 0\n\nsqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n_third)))\n\ndo i = 2, sqrt_n\n\n    count = 0\n\n    temp = n_third\n\n    ! count the exponent of i in n_third\n\n    do while (mod(temp, i) == 0)\n\n        count = count +1\n\n        temp = temp / i\n\n    end do\n\n    if (count >0) then\n\n        ! compute maximum k where k(k+1)/2 <= count\n\n        k = 0\n\n        current = 0\n\n        do while (current + (k+1) <= count)\n\n            k = k +1\n\n            current = current +k\n\n        end do\n\n        answer = answer +k\n\n    end if\n\n    ! update n_third\n\n    n_third = temp\n\nend do\n\nif (n_third >1) then\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\nend if\n\nprint *, answer\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, after counting the exponent count, the original n is divided by i^count. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the n is divided by i each time in the while loop. \n\nIn the code above, temp is divided by i each time, and then after counting, the n_third is set to temp. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nBut in the code above, the loop for counting is done on temp, which is initially n_third. \n\nWait, the code in the third program's Java code is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) {\n\n    int count =0;\n\n    while (0 == (n%i)) {\n\n        n /=i;\n\n        count++;\n\n    }\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nSo in the Java code, n is modified in place. \n\nIn the Fortran code above, temp is used to track the division, and then n_third is set to temp. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nNow, the part where we compute k. \n\nThe maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. \n\nThe code above uses a loop to find k. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute it via the quadratic formula. \n\nThe maximum k is floor( (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2 )\n\nBut for code simplicity, the loop is easier. \n\nThe code in the Fortran part above uses a loop to find k. \n\nWait, the code in the loop:\n\ncurrent starts at 0. \n\nk starts at 0. \n\nThen, while current + (k+1) <= count:\n\n    k +=1\n\n    current +=k \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, k=0, current=0. \n\nFirst iteration: check if current + (k+1) =0+1 <= count \u2192 yes. \n\nk becomes 1, current becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration: check 1 +2 <= count \u2192 yes \u2192 k=2, current=3. \n\nContinue until current + (k+1) exceeds count. \n\nWait, the loop condition is while (current + (k+1) <= count). \n\nWait, after incrementing k and current, the next step is to check again. \n\nWait, the loop is:\n\ndo while (current + (k+1) <= count)\n\n    k =k+1\n\n    current = current +k \n\nend do \n\nWait, but the loop condition is checked before each iteration. \n\nWait, let me see for count=3:\n\nInitial k=0, current=0. \n\nCheck 0 +1 (k+1 is 1) \u2192 1 <=3 \u2192 yes. \n\nk becomes 1, current=1. \n\nNext iteration: current (1) + (1+1)=2 \u2192 2 <=3 \u2192 yes. \n\nk becomes 2, current=3. \n\nNext iteration: current (3) + (2+1)=3+3=6 >3 \u2192 loop stops. \n\nThus, k is 2, which is correct. \n\nAnother example count=6:\n\nInitial k=0, current=0. \n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent +1 (k+1=1) \u2192 1 <=6 \u2192 yes. \n\nk=1, current=1. \n\ncurrent +2 \u2192 3 <=6 \u2192 yes. \n\nk=2, current=3. \n\ncurrent +3 \u21926 \u2192 yes. \n\nk=3, current=6. \n\ncurrent +4 \u219210>6 \u2192 stop. \n\nThus, k=3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the code for finding k is correct. \n\nNow, putting it all together. \n\nThe entire Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, array(100000), i, even_count, odd_count, even_ind, odd_ind, A, B, answer, sqrt_n, temp, count, k, current\n\n    !
