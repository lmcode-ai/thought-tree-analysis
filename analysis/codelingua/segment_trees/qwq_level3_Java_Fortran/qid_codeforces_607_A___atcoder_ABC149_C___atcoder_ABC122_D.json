Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe for loop starts with i=3, and increments by 2 each step. The loop runs while i <= sqrtNum. So after the loop, i is sqrtNum + 2 (if the loop completed all steps without breaking). So if i > sqrtNum \u2192 then the loop didn't find any divisors, so x is prime. Else, if during the loop, a divisor was found (so i is the first divisor found, and the loop breaks early), then i would be <= sqrtNum, so the condition (i > sqrtNum) is false \u2192 so x +=2 and loop again.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_607_A) reads input, processes it, and outputs a number. The second file (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes that output as input, processes it, and outputs another number. The third file (atcoder_ABC122_D) takes the second's output and produces the final result. The goal is to combine all three into one Fortran program without intermediate I/O except for the first read and last print.\n\nHmm, so the first step is to read the input for the first program, process all three steps in sequence, and then output the final result. Let me break down each part.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\nIt reads an integer n, then n pairs of a and beacon[a]. Then it calculates dp array and finds the maximum dp value. The output is n - max.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to read n, then read n pairs into an array. The beacon array is size 1000001, which is big. Wait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but maybe I can use 0-based. Need to adjust indices accordingly. The dp array is also the same size. The loops and conditions should be straightforward, but I have to make sure the indices are correct.\n\nNext, the second Java program (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an integer x, and finds the next prime number that's not 2 and even? Wait, the code checks if x is not 2 and even, then increments to x+1. Then it loops, checking if x is prime. The loop increments by 2 each time. The code is looking for the smallest prime >= x, but with some conditions. Wait, actually, the code seems to find the smallest prime greater than or equal to x, but with the condition that if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1 (so next odd). The loop checks if x is prime. The code increments x by 2 each time until it finds a prime. So the output is that prime.\n\nWait, but the problem might be to find the next prime after x, but the code's logic is a bit different. Let me recheck the code:\n\nThe code starts with x. If x is not 2 and even, it sets x to x+1 (so next odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until it finds a prime. The check is done by trying divisors up to sqrt(x). If any divisor divides x, it breaks and increments x by 2 (since we're only checking odd numbers now). So the code is finding the next prime >= x, but if x was even and not 2, it skips to the next odd. So the output is the next prime after x (or x itself if it's prime and not even except 2).\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to take the first program's output (n - max) as x here, process it, and get the next prime. But in the combined program, the first's output is the input to the second, so in Fortran, the first's result is stored in a variable, then passed to the second's processing.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC122_D) takes an integer N and computes some DP with memoization. The problem is about counting valid strings of length N with certain forbidden substrings. The code uses memoization and recursion. The memo is an array of maps. The isOK function checks if adding a new character to the last three doesn't form \"AGC\" in any adjacent swaps. The DFS function builds the string step by step, ensuring the last four characters don't have forbidden patterns.\n\nTranslating this into Fortran is tricky because Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. So I need to find a way to represent the memoization. Since the maximum N is probably up to some limit (like 1e5?), but the original code uses N up to whatever the input is. Wait, the problem for ABC122_D is probably N up to 2000, given the constraints of such problems. The memo array is of size N+1, each being a map from strings of length 3 to long integers. The strings are combinations of \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\".\n\nHmm, in Fortran, perhaps we can represent the memo as a 4-dimensional array or use a different approach. Alternatively, since the possible last3 strings are limited (4^3 = 64 possibilities), we can map each possible 3-character string to an index (like 0-63) and use a 2D array for memoization. That would be more efficient.\n\nSo first, for the memoization part, instead of a hash map, we can precompute all possible 3-character strings from the tokens and assign each a unique index. Then, the memo can be a 2D array: memo(current, index_of_last3) = value.\n\nThe isOK function checks if the last4 characters (the previous three plus the new character) form any forbidden substring. The forbidden substrings are \"AGC\" and any permutation that could form it via swapping adjacent characters. Wait, the code's isOK function checks:\n\n- If the last4 contains \"AGC\", return false.\n\nThen, for each position in the last4 (except the last?), it swaps adjacent characters and checks again. Wait, the code loops over i from 0 to 2, swaps the i and i+1 characters in the last4 string, then checks if the new string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps result in \"AGC\", then it's invalid.\n\nWait, the code's isOK function is checking that the new character added doesn't create a forbidden substring in the last four characters, even after any single adjacent swap. So the new character must not form a forbidden substring in any possible way after a single swap. That's a bit complex.\n\nIn Fortran, handling strings might be a bit tedious, but since the possible characters are only four, perhaps we can represent the last3 as a 3-character string, and when adding a new character, form the last4 as last3 + c, then check the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since the last3 is stored, when adding a new character c, the last4 is last3 + c. Then, check if any of the permutations (swapping adjacent pairs once) in the last4 contains \"AGC\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the easiest way is to represent the last3 as a string, and when adding a new character, form the last4 string, then check all possible swaps. But in Fortran, string manipulation is a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible last3 strings are limited (4^3 = 64), we can precompute all possible strings and their validity when adding a new character. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, in the isOK function, for a given last3 and new character c, we can form the last4 string (last3 + c), then check:\n\n1. Does the last4 contain \"AGC\"? If yes, invalid.\n\n2. For each of the first three characters in the last4 (indices 0-2), swap with the next character and check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code's loop in isOK is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i+1);\n    vals[i+1] = last4.charAt(i);\n    String s = new String(vals);\n    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) return false;\n}\n\nWait, actually, the code swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, creating a new string, and checks if that contains \"AGC\". So for each possible adjacent pair in the last4 (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3), swapping them and checking if the new string has \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the last4 is 4 characters, so indices 0,1,2,3. The loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since i+1 must be within the string). So swapping positions i and i+1 for each possible pair in the 4-character string. So after swapping, check if any of those swapped strings contain \"AGC\".\n\nTherefore, the isOK function returns true only if none of the original or any single adjacent swap of the last4 contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo in Fortran, to implement this, when adding a new character c to the last3, forming last4 = last3 + c, then:\n\nCheck if \"AGC\" is a substring of last4. If yes, invalid.\n\nThen, for each possible swap between adjacent characters in last4 (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3):\n\n- Create a new string by swapping those two characters.\n\n- Check if \"AGC\" is present in that swapped string.\n\nIf any of these checks are true, then the new character is invalid.\n\nHmm, this requires string manipulation. In Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's think of the last4 as a 4-character string. For each possible swap, we can create a temporary string, check for \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the last3 as a 3-character string, and when adding a new character, form the last4, then check all possibilities.\n\nThis might be manageable, but in Fortran, handling strings with functions like index to check for substrings.\n\nAlternatively, since the forbidden substring is \"AGC\", perhaps we can check for its presence in the last4 and in the swapped versions.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible position in the last4, check if any of the three possible swaps (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3) would create \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to code the checks step by step.\n\nNow, the main challenge is translating the recursive DFS with memoization into Fortran. Since Fortran doesn't have hash maps, but the possible last3 strings are limited (64 possibilities), we can map each possible last3 string to an integer index (0-63). Then, the memo can be a 2D array: memo(current, index) = value.\n\nFirst, we need to precompute all possible 3-character strings from the tokens \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\". Each character has 4 options, so 4^3 = 64 possibilities. We can assign each a unique index. For example, \"AAA\" is 0, \"AAC\" is 1, etc. To do this, we can create a list of all possible combinations and a hash table (or a lookup array) to map a string to its index.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can represent the last3 as a 3-character string, and for each step, when we need to look up the memo, we can compute the index based on the characters. For example, each character can be converted to a number (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3), so the index would be (c1 * 16) + (c2 *4) + c3. Wait, since each character has 4 options, the first character (position 0) contributes 4^2, the second 4^1, third 4^0. So the index would be (char1)*16 + (char2)*4 + char3. But we need to map each character to a number. For example, 'A' is 0, 'C' is 1, 'G' is 2, 'T' is 3. So for a string like \"AGC\", the first character is 'A' (0), second 'G' (2), third 'C' (1). So index would be 0*16 + 2*4 +1 = 9.\n\nWait, but the order of the characters in the string is important. So for each character in the string, we can map it to a number, then compute the index as (c1 * 4^2) + (c2 *4) + c3. That way, each possible 3-character string maps to a unique index from 0 to 63.\n\nSo first, in the Fortran code, I can precompute a function to convert a 3-character string to its index. Let's see:\n\nFunction char_to_num(c) result(num)\n    character, intent(in) :: c\n    integer :: num\n    select case (c)\n    case ('A')\n        num = 0\n    case ('C')\n        num = 1\n    case ('G')\n        num = 2\n    case ('T')\n        num = 3\n    end select\nend function\n\nThen, for a string s of length 3:\n\nindex = char_to_num(s(1)) * 16 + char_to_num(s(2)) *4 + char_to_num(s(3))\n\nWait, 4^2 is 16, 4^1 is 4, so yes. So that gives a unique index from 0 to 63.\n\nSo the memo can be a 2D array: memo(current_length, index) = value mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe maximum N is whatever the input is. The original code uses N up to some value (like 2000?), but in the problem statement for ABC122_D, the constraints are probably N up to 2000. So the memo array can be dimensioned as (0:N, 0:63), but in Fortran, we can pre-allocate it based on N.\n\nWait, but in the first part of the Fortran program, we need to process the first two steps, then get N from the second's output? Wait no, the third program's input is the output of the second program. Wait, the second program's output is the x value (the prime number), but the third program's input is N, which is read from stdin. Wait, looking back at the third Java program:\n\nThe third program's main reads N from stdin. So the output of the second program (the prime number) is not used as input to the third program. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the user's instruction says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But looking at the third Java program, it reads N from stdin. So the second program's output must be N for the third program. But the second program's output is a prime number, which is an integer. So the third program's N is that prime number. So the third program's input is the output of the second program.\n\nWait, but in the third Java program, the code reads N from stdin. So the third program's input is the output of the second program. So the third program's N is the prime number found by the second program. So the third program's input is that prime number. So the third program's N is the output of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's input is the user's input (the original input for the first Java program). Its output is a number (n - max). That becomes the input to the second program, which processes it and outputs a prime number. That prime number is the input to the third program, which uses it as N and outputs the result of the DP calculation.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (the original input for codeforces_607_A).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic, compute the output (n - max).\n\n3. Use that output as the input to the second program's logic (atcoder_ABC149_C), compute the next prime.\n\n4. Use that prime as the input N for the third program's logic (atcoder_ABC122_D), compute the DP result.\n\n5. Output the final result from the third program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the first input, process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the first part: codeforces_607_A.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- n: integer.\n\n- beacon array: size 1000001 (indices 0 to 1000000). But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with a dimension starting at 0. So declare beacon(0:1000000), same for dp.\n\nWait, in Java, the beacon array is size 1000001 (indices 0 to 1000000). So in Fortran, we can have beacon(0:1000000). But in Fortran, the maximum array size might be an issue. 1e6 elements is manageable, but maybe in some compilers it's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the problem constraints for the first program have a smaller n, but the code uses 1e6 as the max possible a. So we need to declare arrays of size 1000001.\n\nBut in Fortran, declaring such a large array may require compiler flags or adjustments. Alternatively, maybe the problem's constraints for the first program have a maximum a value of 1e6, so the array must be that size.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_a = 1000000\n\ninteger :: beacon(0:max_a), dp(0:max_a)\n\nThen, read n, then read n pairs of a and beacon(a). Wait, in Java, the code does:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    int a = sc.nextInt();\n    beacon[a] = sc.nextInt();\n}\n\nSo for each of the n lines, read a and then the beacon value. So in Fortran, after reading n, we need to read n pairs. So:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) a, val\n    beacon(a) = val\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices start at 1 for loops, but the a can be 0 to 1e6. So the loop is okay.\n\nThen, initialize dp array. The first part of the code:\n\ndp(0) = 1 if beacon(0) !=0, else 0?\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nif (beacon[0] !=0) dp[0] =1 else?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (beacon[0] !=0) dp[0] =1;\n\nElse, what? The code doesn't set it, so it remains 0.\n\nThen, the loop from 1 to 1e6:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < 1e6+1; i++) {\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (i=1; i < 1000001; i++), so i goes up to 1e6.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to max_a (1e6).\n\nThe conditions:\n\nif beacon(i) !=0 and beacon(i) <i:\n\nthen dp[i] = dp[i - beacon[i] -1] +1\n\nelse if beacon[i] !=0 (but >=i):\n\nthen dp[i] =1\n\nelse (beacon[i] is 0):\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1]\n\nThen, track the maximum dp[i].\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\ndo i = 1, max_a\n\n    if (beacon(i) /=0) then\n\n        if (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n            dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) +1\n\n        else\n\n            dp(i) =1\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\n    end if\n\n    if (dp(i) > max_val) then\n\n        max_val = dp(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is up to 1e6 (since the array is 1e6+1 elements). So the Fortran code is okay.\n\nThen, the first program's output is n - max_val.\n\nSo after processing, we have first_result = n - max_val.\n\nNow, the second program's input is first_result. The second program's code is to compute the next prime.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is x (the first_result). The code:\n\nif x !=2 and x even, then x +=1 (so next odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\nwhile true:\n\n    check if x is prime.\n\n    To check, compute sqrt(x), then check divisors from 3 to sqrt(x) step 2.\n\n    If any divisor divides x, break and increment x by 2.\n\n    Else, break and return x.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nInitialize x as input.\n\nif (x !=2 and x%2 ==0) then x +=1 (so x becomes odd).\n\nthen loop:\n\n    set sqrtNum = sqrt(x)\n\n    for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2:\n\n        if x mod i ==0 \u2192 break.\n\n    if after the loop, i > sqrtNum \u2192 then x is prime, break.\n\n    else \u2192 x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the loop is a bit tricky. Let me re-express the code's logic.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    int i;\n\n    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n    for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n        if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n    }\n\n    if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n    else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo, after the for loop, if the loop didn't break early (i.e., no divisors found), then i would be sqrtNum+2 (since the loop increments by 2 each time). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe for loop starts with i=3, and increments by 2 each step. The loop runs while i <= sqrtNum. So after the loop, i is sqrtNum + 2 (if the loop completed all steps without breaking). So if i > sqrtNum \u2192 then the loop didn't find any divisors, so x is prime.\n\nElse, if during the loop, a divisor was found (so i is the first divisor found, and the loop breaks early), then i would be <= sqrtNum, so the condition (i > sqrtNum) is false \u2192 so x +=2 and loop again.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, implementing this:\n\nWe need to compute x as the first_result, then process.\n\nFirst, check if x is even and not 2 \u2192 then set x = x+1.\n\nThen, loop:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n    compute sqrt_num = sqrt(x)\n\n    is_prime = .true.\n\n    do i = 3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n        if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n            is_prime = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (is_prime) then\n\n        exit\n\n    else\n\n        x = x +2\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop can be written with a flag.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nx = first_result\n\nif (mod(x,2) ==0 .and. x /=2) then\n\n    x = x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo\n\n    sqrt_num = nint(sqrt(real(x)))  ! Need to cast to real to compute sqrt.\n\n    ! Or use sqrt(x) as a real number.\n\n    found = .false.\n\n    do i = 3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n        if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n            found = .true.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. found) then\n\n        exit\n\n    else\n\n        x = x +2\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop continues until x is prime. So the code above should work.\n\nWait, but the initial check for evenness is important. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x is even and not 2 \u2192 then x is set to x+1 (odd). Then, in the loop, check if it's prime. If not, add 2 (so next odd).\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nOnce the loop exits, x is the desired prime. So the second program's output is x.\n\nNow, the third program's input is this x (the prime number). The third program reads N from stdin, which is this x.\n\nThe third program's code is the DP with memoization.\n\nNow, the third program's code is more complex. Let's think about how to translate it.\n\nThe third program's main function reads N from input, then calls a function that computes the number of valid strings of length N, avoiding certain substrings.\n\nThe key is to implement the memoization and the recursive DFS with the constraints.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, since we can't have hash maps, we need to represent the memo as a 2D array. The possible last3 strings are 64 possibilities, so the memo can be an array of size (N+1) x 64, with each element storing the computed value mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Read N (the prime from the second program's output).\n\n2. Initialize memo array. Since in Fortran, arrays are static, we need to allocate it dynamically based on N. Alternatively, since N can be up to, say, 2000 (as per problem constraints), we can predefine the maximum N as 2000 and use that. Wait, but the second program's output could be a very large prime, but in the problem's context, the third program's N is the output of the second program, which is a prime number. However, the third program's problem (ABC122_D) likely has constraints on N, like N up to 2000. Because otherwise, the memoization would be too big. Let me check the problem statement for ABC122_D.\n\nLooking up ABC122_D's problem statement (assuming it's the same as the code's context), the constraints are probably N \u2264 2000. So in the code, the memo array can be dimensioned as (0:2000, 0:63), but in Fortran, we can set it as a 2D array with the maximum N.\n\nWait, but in the code, the N is read from input, so we need to handle variable N. However, in Fortran, arrays can be allocated dynamically. So perhaps we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum N is 2000, we can set the array size to 2000. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, allocatable :: memo(:,:)\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: last3\n\nThe memo array will be (0:N, 0:63). Wait, but in Fortran, the first dimension is the rows. So perhaps:\n\nallocate(memo(0:N, 0:63))\n\nBut first, after reading N, we can allocate the array.\n\nNow, the main function is to compute the result via a recursive function. But Fortran doesn't have built-in memoization, so we need to implement it with a helper function and the memo array.\n\nAlternatively, since recursion in Fortran can be tricky for large N, perhaps an iterative approach is better, but given the problem's constraints (N up to 2000), recursion might be manageable with memoization.\n\nAlternatively, we can implement the DFS as a recursive function with the memo array.\n\nThe steps for the third program:\n\nInitialize the memo array with -1 (or some invalid value) to indicate uncomputed states.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, 'TTT').\n\nThe function dfs(current, last3) returns the number of valid strings of length current, ending with last3.\n\nThe base case is when current == N \u2192 return 1.\n\nFor each possible next character (A, C, G, T), check if adding it to last3 forms a valid last4 (i.e., the new string last3 + c must pass the isOK check).\n\nIf valid, then the next last3 is last3(2:3) + c (since the new last3 is the last three characters of the new string).\n\nThe result is the sum over all valid next characters of dfs(current+1, new_last3).\n\nThe memo is stored as memo(current, index_of_last3) = result mod MOD.\n\nSo in Fortran, the function would look like this (pseudocode):\n\nfunction dfs(current, last3) result(res)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: current\n\n    character(len=3), intent(in) :: last3\n\n    integer :: res\n\n    integer :: idx, i, c_val, new_idx\n\n    if (current == N) then\n\n        res = 1\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    idx = get_index(last3)\n\n    if (memo(current, idx) /= -1) then\n\n        res = memo(current, idx)\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    res = 0\n\n    do i = 1, 4\n\n        c = tokens(i)\n\n        new_last4 = last3 // c\n\n        if (is_ok(new_last4)) then\n\n            new_last3 = last3(2:3) // c\n\n            new_idx = get_index(new_last3)\n\n            res = res + dfs(current+1, new_last3)\n\n            res = mod(res, MOD)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    memo(current, idx) = res\n\n    return\n\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't modify arrays outside their scope unless they are module variables or passed as arguments. So the memo array needs to be accessible in the function. Alternatively, we can use a module or make it a global variable.\n\nAlternatively, since the code is in a single program, we can have the memo array as a global variable.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N (the output of the second program).\n\n2. Initialize the memo array with -1 (or some sentinel value).\n\n3. Precompute the tokens as an array of characters: tokens(1:4) = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'].\n\n4. Define the get_index function as described earlier.\n\n5. Define the is_ok function, which takes a 4-character string and checks the conditions.\n\nWait, the is_ok function needs to check the last4 string (4 characters) for forbidden substrings and their swaps.\n\nImplementing is_ok:\n\nlogical function is_ok(s)\n\n    character(len=4), intent(in) :: s\n\n    logical :: ok\n\n    ok = .true.\n\n    ! Check if \"AGC\" is present in s.\n\n    if (index(s, 'AGC') /=0) then\n\n        ok = .false.\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now check all possible adjacent swaps.\n\n    do i = 1, 3  ! positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 (since Fortran is 1-based)\n\n        ! Swap characters at positions i and i+1.\n\n        temp = s\n\n        temp(i:i+1) = temp(i+1:i:-1)  ! swap characters at i and i+1\n\n        if (index(temp, 'AGC') /=0) then\n\n            ok = .false.\n\n            return\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    is_ok = ok\n\nend function\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. So for a 4-character string s, the indices are 1 to 4.\n\nThe loop for i from 1 to 3 (since swapping positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4).\n\nWhen swapping i and i+1, the substring from i to i+1 is reversed.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'ABCD', then swapping positions 1 and 2 gives 'BACD'.\n\nThen, check if the new string contains 'AGC'.\n\nIf any of the swapped strings contain 'AGC', then return false.\n\nSo the is_ok function returns true only if none of the original or swapped strings contain 'AGC'.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe main program steps:\n\nRead N (the output of the second program).\n\nInitialize memo array as -1.\n\nCall dfs(0, 'TTT').\n\nOutput the result mod MOD.\n\nNow, the recursion depth for N=2000 might be an issue in Fortran, but with memoization, it should be manageable.\n\nNow, putting all three parts into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe overall structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: first_result, second_result, third_result\n\n    !

Output the third result.\n\n    print*, third_result\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some issues here. For example, in the third part, the tokens are defined as a 4-element array of length 1 characters? Or length 1 strings? Also, in the code, the tokens are used to loop over each character.\n\nWait, in the third program's code, the tokens are \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\", each a single character. So in Fortran, tokens can be a character array of length 1, with 4 elements.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(4) :: tokens = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\nBut in the current code, I have:\n\ncharacter(len=4), parameter :: tokens(4) = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\nThat's incorrect. Each element should be length 1. So:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(4), parameter :: tokens = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\nAlso, in the loop over tokens:\n\ndo i =1,4\n\n    c = tokens(i)\n\n    new_last4 = last3 // c\n\n    ...\n\nend do\n\nThat should work.\n\nAnother issue: in the is_ok function, the 'AGC' check uses the index function. In Fortran, the index function returns the position of the substring, so if it's not zero, it means found. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother point: the memo array is initialized to -1. But in Fortran, when we allocate it, we can set all elements to -1 using:\n\nmemo = -1\n\nBut in the code above, after allocation, that's done.\n\nNow, the main program's third part:\n\nAfter computing second_result (the prime), we set N_third = second_result.\n\nThen, we need to define the functions (get_index, char_to_num, is_ok, dfs) inside the program's contains section.\n\nThe memo array is declared as allocatable, and allocated based on N_third.\n\nThe dfs function is recursive and uses the memo array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the memo array must be accessible in the dfs function. Since it's in the contains section, and the function is inside the program, it should have access to the memo array declared in the main program.\n\nWait, in the code above, the memo array is declared in the main program's scope, after the contains section. That might not be allowed. The order matters in Fortran.\n\nThe correct structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    ... variables for first and second parts ...\n\n    contains\n\n        functions and subroutines here\n\n    ... variables for third part ...\n\n    ! Then, after contains, variables can be declared.\n\nWait, no. In Fortran, the contains section must come after all variable declarations in the program. So the code structure should be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    ! Variables for first and second parts\n\n    integer :: first_result, second_result, third_result\n\n    integer, parameter :: max_a = 1000000\n\n    integer :: n, beacon(0:max_a), dp(0:max_a), max_val\n\n    !

Variables for third part\n\n    integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n    integer :: N_third\n\n    character(len=3) :: last3_initial = 'TTT'\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(4), parameter :: tokens = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\n    contains\n\n        ! Define the functions here\n\n    end program main\n\nWait, but the third part's variables (like N_third, tokens, etc.) need to be declared before the contains section. Alternatively, perhaps better to structure the code so that all variables are declared first, then the contains section with functions, then the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be structured as:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    !

In Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0 by default if not specified, but in the code above, after reading n, we set beacon =0. That's redundant but okay.\n\n- The loop for reading the beacon values: the variables a and val are not declared. Need to declare them as integers.\n\nAh, right!

In Fortran, this might take time, but the problem's constraints for the first program might allow it.\n\nOverall, this should work. The final Fortran program combines all three steps into one, reading input once and outputting the final result."
