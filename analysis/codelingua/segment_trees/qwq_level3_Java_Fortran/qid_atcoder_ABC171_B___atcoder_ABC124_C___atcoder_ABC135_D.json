So the 'current_char == '?' ' condition will never be true. But the third program's original code is for a problem where the input can have '?', but in this sequence, the input is the count's string, which has no '?'. So the code will handle it correctly. Another possible issue: in the process_third function, the chars_reversed array is allocated with len, but the loop for i=1 to len is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC171_B). It reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers. It sorts the array and sums the first k elements. The output is this sum. So the first program's output is just a single integer, which will be the input for the second program.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string and calculates the minimum number of changes needed so that no two adjacent characters are the same. The input here is a string, which comes from the first program's output. Wait, but the first program outputs an integer. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, but the second program expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the sum, which is an integer. The second program's input is a string. So how does that work? Oh, perhaps the first program's output is written as a string, and the second program reads that as its input. But the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output must be a string. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the sequence is not correct? Or maybe I need to see how the outputs and inputs are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Let me check each program's input and output.\n\nFirst program's output is the sum (integer). Second program's input is a string (the problem says the second program's input is a string, as it reads a string via next() in the InputReader). So the first program's output must be a string, but it's an integer. So the second program is expecting a string, which is the integer from the first program. So the first program's output is written as a string, and the second program reads that as its input. Then the second program's output is the minimum of a1 and a2, which is an integer again. The third program's input is a string (since it reads a string via Scanner's next()), so the second program's output must be a string. Wait, but the third program's input is a string, so the second program's output must be a string. But the second program's output is an integer (the min of a1 and a2). So the second program's output is written as an integer, which is then read as a string by the third program. Wait, but the third program's input is a string, so the second program's output must be a string. Hmm, perhaps the second program's output is an integer, which is written as a string, and the third program reads that as a string. Let me check the third program's code.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string via sc.next(). So the input is a string. The second program's output is an integer, so that integer is written as a string, which is then read by the third program as the input string. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second program's output. \n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nProgram 1: Reads input (n, k, array), outputs an integer (sum of first k elements after sorting).\n\nProgram 2: Reads that integer as a string (so the input is the string form of the sum), then processes it as a string (the problem says the second program's input is a string, so the input is the string of the sum). Wait, but the second program's code is for a problem where the input is a string (like a sequence of '0's and '1's?), but in this case, the input would be the sum's string. Wait, but the second program's problem (ABC124_C) is about a string of characters, so perhaps the input here is a string, but in the sequence, the first program's output is an integer, so the second program's input is that integer as a string. So the second program's code would process that string (e.g., if the sum was 123, the input is \"123\", and the program would count the changes needed so that adjacent characters are different. But in the original problem, the input is a string of characters (maybe 0/1?), but in this sequence, the input is a number's string. So the second program's code is correct as per its problem, but in the sequence, the input is different. However, the user's instruction is to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So I have to follow the sequence as given, even if the inputs/outputs between the Java programs may not align with their original problem's inputs. The user wants the sequence's behavior, so the first program's output is the input to the second, etc.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. First Java program: Reads n, k, array, sorts array, sums first k elements, outputs the sum (integer).\n\n2. Second Java program: Reads the sum as a string (since it's the input), then processes it as per its code (the problem's code for ABC124_C). Wait, but the second program's code is for a problem where the input is a string (like \"0001\"), but here the input is the sum's string. So the second program will process that string, counting the minimal changes to make adjacent characters different. The output is the minimal count (integer).\n\n3. Third Java program: Reads the second's output (the count as a string?), but the third program's input is a string (from the second's output, which is an integer, so the third program's input is the string of that integer). The third program's code is for a problem where the input is a string (like a sequence of digits and '?'), but in this sequence, the input is the string of the second's output (an integer). So the third program will process that string (e.g., if the second's output was 5, the input is \"5\", and the third program's code would process that as a string, perhaps leading to some calculation modulo 1e9+7, but the code's actual logic is for a different problem. However, the user wants the sequence's behavior, so I have to follow the code as given.\n\nTherefore, the three Java programs form a chain where each's output is the next's input. The task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, the last writing output, and the intermediates processing data in memory.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, k, array elements).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (sort array, sum first k elements).\n\n3. Take that sum, pass it as input to the second program's logic (treat it as a string, process it to find minimal changes).\n\n4. Take the result from the second program (the count), pass it as input to the third program's logic (process as a string, compute the required value).\n\n5. Output the final result from the third program.\n\nSo, the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst part: Read n, k, array. Sort the array, sum first k elements. The sum is an integer (call it sum1).\n\nSecond part: Take sum1 as a string, process it as per the second Java program's logic. The second program's code takes a string, then for each position, checks adjacent characters and counts the minimal changes. The output is an integer (min(a1, a2)).\n\nThird part: Take that integer (call it count), convert to string, process as per the third Java program's logic. The third program's code uses dynamic programming on the input string (digits and '?'), but in this case, the input is the count's string. The output is the final value modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n, k, array. Sort the array. Sum first k elements.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be sorted with the Mergesort or using the intrinsic function. But for simplicity, perhaps use a bubble sort or call a sort routine. Alternatively, use the built-in sort function. Let me see.\n\nFortran has the 'sort' intrinsic. So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\nread *, n, k\nallocate(a(n))\nread *, a\ncall merge_sort(a)  ! Or use the built-in sort function. Wait, in Fortran 90+, you can use the intrinsic function.\n\nWait, the intrinsic function is 'sort', but the syntax is a bit different. For example:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nBut I need to make sure it's in ascending order. The default is ascending, so that's okay.\n\nThen sum the first k elements:\n\nsum1 = sum(a(1:k))\n\nSecond part:\n\nTake sum1 as a string. Let's convert the integer to a string. In Fortran, we can use write with an internal file.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(i0)') sum1\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen process this string as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nThe input is a string x. Then two approaches are taken:\n\nApproach 1: Iterate from left to right, changing the current character if it's same as previous. Count the changes (a1).\n\nApproach 2: Iterate from right to left, changing the previous character if same as next. Count the changes (a2). The minimal of a1 and a2 is output.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nIn the second Java program's solve method:\n\nThey have a and b as StringBuilders of the input string x.\n\nFor a:\n\nLoop from i=1 to length-1:\n\nif current char same as previous, change it to the opposite (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nFor b:\n\nLoop from i = length-1 downto 1:\n\nif current char same as previous, change the previous to opposite, increment a2.\n\nWait, the code for b is a bit different. Let me see:\n\nIn the code for a:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i - 1)) {\n        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n        else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n        a1++;\n    }\n}\n\nSo for a, when the current character is same as previous, change the current to opposite.\n\nFor b:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n        a2++;\n    }\n}\n\nHere, when the current and previous are same, they change the previous character (i-1) to opposite. So the direction is different.\n\nThe minimal of a1 and a2 is the output.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nFirst, create two copies of the string s (sum1's string). Let's call them a_str and b_str.\n\nInitialize a1 and a2 to 0.\n\nProcessing a_str:\n\nDo i from 2 to len_trim(s):\n\n   if a_str(i:i) == a_str(i-1:i-1), then:\n\n      if a_str(i) is '1', set to '0', else '1'\n\n      a1 +=1\n\nProcessing b_str:\n\nLoop from i = len_trim(s) downto 2:\n\n   if b_str(i) == b_str(i-1):\n\n      if b_str(i-1) is '1', set to '0', else '1'\n\n      a2 +=1\n\nWait, but in the code for b, the loop is from the end to the start, and when they are same, they change the previous (i-1) character. So in Fortran:\n\nFor the b_str processing:\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 2, -1\n\n   if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n\n      if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n\n          b_str(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          b_str(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop in Java is for i from x.length()-1 downto 1 (since i starts at x.length()-1, which is the last index (since Java is 0-based). So in Fortran, which is 1-based, the loop would be from len_trim(s) downto 2 (since i starts at the last character and goes down to 2, so i-1 is from len_trim(s)-1 down to 1).\n\nSo the code for a_str and b_str can be implemented in Fortran.\n\nOnce a1 and a2 are computed, the minimal is the result (count).\n\nThird part:\n\nTake count (the minimal a1/a2) and convert to a string. Let's call this string input_str.\n\nThen process this string as per the third Java program's logic.\n\nThe third Java program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of digits and '?', and the goal is to compute the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe code uses dynamic programming. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe input is a string (cs) converted to a char array. The code processes it from the end (since it's using cs[cs.length -1 -i], which in Java is the reverse order). The code uses a DP array dp[i][mod], where dp[i][m] is the number of ways up to the first i+1 characters (since it's processed in reverse) with mod m.\n\nThe base is 10^i mod 13, and the transitions are based on the current digit (or all possible digits if it's a '?').\n\nIn Fortran, I need to implement this DP.\n\nFirst, the input_str is the string of the count (e.g., if count is 5, input_str is \"5\").\n\nThe code in Java processes the characters in reverse order. Let me see:\n\nThe loop is for i from 0 to cs.length-1. The index in the array is cs[cs.length-1 -i], so for i=0, it's the last character, then i=1 is the second last, etc. So the processing is from the end to the start of the string.\n\nIn Fortran, the input_str is a string. Let's get its length as len = len_trim(input_str).\n\nThe characters are stored in an array, say chars(1:len).\n\nWe can process them in reverse order, so for each position from 1 to len (original first character is last in processing).\n\nThe DP array is a 2D array of size (len) x 13. Since Fortran arrays are 1-based, perhaps declare as dp(0:len, 0:12) (since in Java it's 0-based for the indices). Wait, the Java code uses dp[i][pre], where i is up to the length of the string. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, the dp array is declared as long[cs.length][13]. The loop runs for i from 0 to cs.length-1. So for each i, the first i+1 characters (since starting from 0). The base is initialized as 1, and multiplied by 10 each step mod 13.\n\nThe base in the code starts at 1, and for each step, base = base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nbase is initialized to 1.\n\nThen, for each i (from 0 to len-1):\n\n   base = base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nInside the loop over i (from 0 to cs.length-1):\n\n   ... \n\n   base = base *10 %13;\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n    ... \n\n    base = base *10 %13;\n\n}\n\nWait, so the base is updated after processing each character. The base is used in the calculation for the next step. The base represents 10^i mod13, but perhaps in reverse order.\n\nWait, the code is processing the characters in reverse order (since the index is cs.length-1 -i). So the first character processed is the last character of the string, then the second last, etc. The base starts at 1 (for the first character processed, which is the last character of the original string, so its contribution is digit * 10^0 mod13). Then, for the next character (second last), the base is multiplied by 10 mod13, so it becomes 10^1 mod13, etc. So the base is 10^i mod13, where i is the number of steps taken so far (starting from 0).\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each position i (in the loop variable i from 0 to len-1):\n\n   current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i) in the original string.\n\n   if the current character is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9), we consider adding it.\n\n   else, only the digit is considered.\n\n   For each possible previous mod (pre from 0-12):\n\n      for each possible next digit (d):\n\n          new_mod = (d * base + pre) mod13\n\n          dp[i][new_mod] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\n          mod by MOD.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the first case (if the character is '?'):\n\nfor (int next =0; next <10; next++) {\n\n    dp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1:0))\n\n    mod.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's loop for next is 0-9, and for each pre, the new mod is (base * next + pre) mod13.\n\nWait, the base is 10^i mod13, where i is the current loop index (since base starts at 1 and is multiplied by 10 each step). Wait, the base is updated after processing each step. Let me see:\n\nInitially, base is 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n   process the current character (the (cs.length-1 -i)th character).\n\n   then, base = base *10 mod13.\n\nSo for the first iteration (i=0), the base is 1 (before processing), then after processing, it becomes 10 mod13.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1), base is 10, then becomes 100 mod13 (which is 9, since 10*10=100 mod13 is 9).\n\nWait, but the base is used in the calculation for the current step. So for the current character (the (cs.length-1 -i)th character), the contribution is digit * base (since base is 10^i mod13, where i is the current loop index). Because the first character processed is the last digit (units place), so its contribution is digit * 1 (10^0), then next is 10^1, etc.\n\nTherefore, the DP transitions are correct.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to implement this DP.\n\nFirst, the input_str is the string of the count (the second program's output). Let's get its length as len = len_trim(input_str).\n\nWe need to process each character in reverse order. So first, create an array of characters:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: chars\n\nallocate(chars(len))\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   chars(i) = input_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, process in reverse order (the first character processed is chars(len), then chars(len-1), etc. Wait, no, the loop in Java is for i from 0 to len-1, and the current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (chars(len)), for i=1, it's chars(len-1), etc. So the loop in Fortran would be over i from 0 to len-1, and the current character is chars(len -i).\n\nWait, perhaps better to process the characters in reverse order, so for each step, the current character is the next one from the end.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the loop can be:\n\ndo i = 1 to len\n\n   current_char = chars(len - i +1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute the characters in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, let's process the characters in reverse order, so the first step (i=1) processes the last character of the original string, then the second step (i=2) processes the second last, etc. So the loop variable in Fortran can be from 1 to len.\n\nSo for each step i (from 1 to len):\n\n   current_char = chars(len - i +1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the array first.\n\nchars_reversed(1:len) = chars(len:1:-1)\n\nThen, process each character in chars_reversed in order.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the DP array. Let's declare it as a 2D array. Since in Java it's dp[i][pre], where i ranges from 0 to len-1 (so in Fortran, perhaps dp(0:len, 0:12)), but since Fortran arrays are 1-based, maybe dp(1:len+1, 0:12). Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, the dp array is of size [cs.length][13]. The loop runs for i from 0 to cs.length-1. For each i, the current step is processing the (i)th element in the loop (which corresponds to the (cs.length-1 -i)th character in the original string). The DP for step i is stored in dp[i][...].\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can have a 2D array dp(0:len, 0:12), where dp(0,0) =1, and others are 0 initially. Then, for each step from 1 to len:\n\n   current character is the ith character in the reversed order.\n\n   compute the transitions based on the current character and the previous dp values.\n\nWait, let me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize dp(0,0) =1, others 0.\n\nThen for each step i from 1 to len:\n\n   current_char = the ith character in reversed order (i.e., the ith character from the end of the original string).\n\n   base = 10^(i-1) mod13. Wait, because in Java, the base starts at 1 (for i=0, which is the first step, the base is 1, then after processing, it becomes 10 mod13. So for step i (in Fortran's 1-based), the base is 10^(i-1) mod13.\n\nWait, in Java's code:\n\nInitially, base =1.\n\nThen, after processing each step (i from 0 to len-1):\n\n   after processing, base *=10 mod13.\n\nSo for step i (Java's loop variable):\n\n   during processing, the base is 10^i mod13?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt the start, base is 1 (before any steps).\n\nAfter first iteration (i=0):\n\n   process the first character (last in original string).\n\n   then base becomes 1*10 mod13 =10.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\n   process second character (second last in original).\n\n   base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9.\n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\n   base becomes 9*10 mod13 = 90 mod13 = 12 (since 13*6=78, 90-78=12).\n\nSo for step i (Java's loop variable), the base during processing is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, no, during processing step i (Java's loop variable), the base is 10^i mod13?\n\nWait, the base is updated after processing each step. So during the processing of step i (Java's loop variable), the base is 10^i mod13?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt the start, base is 1 (before any steps).\n\nProcessing step i=0 (first step):\n\n   during processing, the base is 1 (since it hasn't been updated yet).\n\n   after processing, base becomes 1*10 mod13 =10.\n\nProcessing step i=1 (second step):\n\n   during processing, the base is 10 (from previous step).\n\n   after processing, base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 9.\n\nSo during processing step i (Java's loop variable), the base is 10^i mod13?\n\nWait, for i=0, base is 1 (10^0).\n\nYes. So during processing step i (Java's loop variable), the base is 10^i mod13.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each step i (1-based in Fortran's loop from 1 to len), the base is 10^(i-1) mod13.\n\nWait, because in Fortran's first step (i=1) corresponds to Java's i=0, so base is 10^0 mod13 =1.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each step i (1 to len):\n\n   current base is 10^(i-1) mod13.\n\n   compute the transitions based on the current character and the previous DP values.\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each step i:\n\n   current character is chars_reversed(i) (assuming we have reversed the string).\n\n   if the current character is '?', then possible digits are 0-9.\n\n   else, only the digit is considered.\n\n   For each previous mod (pre from 0 to 12):\n\n      if the previous step's dp(i-1, pre) is non-zero:\n\n          for each possible digit (d):\n\n              if the current character is not '?' and d != current digit's value, skip.\n\n              new_mod = (d * base + pre) mod13\n\n              dp(i, new_mod) = (dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)) mod MOD\n\n   Wait, but in the code, the transitions are:\n\n   For each pre in 0..12:\n\n      if the previous step (i-1) has dp[i-1][pre], then for each possible next digit (d):\n\n          new_mod = (d * base + pre) mod13\n\n          dp[i][new_mod] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\n   So in Fortran, for each step i:\n\n      allocate a new dp array for this step, or use a temporary array.\n\n      Since in Fortran, we can't have a 2D array with dynamic allocation easily, perhaps use two 1D arrays: previous and current.\n\n      Let me think of using two arrays: prev_dp(0:12) and curr_dp(0:12).\n\n      Initialize curr_dp to 0.\n\n      For each pre in 0:12:\n\n          if prev_dp(pre) >0:\n\n              for each possible digit d (0-9 if current is '?', else only the digit):\n\n                  new_mod = mod(d * base + pre, 13)\n\n                  curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + prev_dp(pre), MOD)\n\n      Then, after processing all, set prev_dp = curr_dp, and reset curr_dp for next step.\n\nWait, but in the first step (i=1), the previous_dp is the initial state (prev_dp(0)=1, others 0).\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize prev_dp as [1,0,0,...0].\n\nThen for each step i from 1 to len:\n\n   compute base = 10^(i-1) mod13.\n\n   current_char = chars_reversed(i)\n\n   initialize curr_dp to 0.\n\n   loop over pre from 0 to 12:\n\n      if prev_dp(pre) ==0, skip.\n\n      then, for each possible digit d:\n\n          if current_char is not '?' and d != the digit value of current_char, skip.\n\n          compute new_mod = mod(d * base + pre, 13)\n\n          curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + prev_dp(pre), MOD)\n\n   then, set prev_dp = curr_dp, and reset curr_dp for next step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are static. So perhaps:\n\nWe can have a 2D array dp(0:len, 0:12), with dp(0,0)=1, others 0.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to len:\n\n   current_char = chars_reversed(i)\n\n   base = 10^(i-1) mod13\n\n   do pre =0,12\n\n      if (dp(i-1, pre) ==0) cycle\n\n      if (current_char == '?') then\n\n          do d=0,9\n\n              new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n              dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n          end do\n\n      else\n\n          d = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n          new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n          dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but this may not be correct because for each pre, the contributions from all possible digits must be added. Wait, perhaps the code should loop over all possible digits first, then for each pre, add to new_mod.\n\nAlternatively, the code should loop over all possible digits, and for each digit, loop over all pre.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to structure it as:\n\nfor each i from 1 to len:\n\n   current_char = chars_reversed(i)\n\n   base = 10^(i-1) mod13\n\n   initialize curr_dp to 0.\n\n   do pre =0,12\n\n      if (dp_prev(pre) ==0) cycle\n\n      if (current_char == '?') then\n\n          do d=0,9\n\n              new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n              curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n          end do\n\n      else\n\n          d = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n          new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n          curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   then, set dp_prev = curr_dp for next step.\n\nWait, but in this case, the curr_dp is being built by adding contributions from each pre and each digit. However, the way it's written, for each pre, the code loops over the digits and adds to curr_dp. But this may be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should loop over all possible digits first, then for each pre, compute the contribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be:\n\nfor each i from 1 to len:\n\n   current_char = chars_reversed(i)\n\n   base = 10^(i-1) mod13\n\n   curr_dp = 0\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n\n       do d=0,9\n\n           do pre=0,12\n\n               if (dp_prev(pre) ==0) cycle\n\n               new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n               curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n           end do\n\n       end do\n\n   else\n\n       d = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n       do pre=0,12\n\n           if (dp_prev(pre) ==0) cycle\n\n           new_mod = mod(d * base + pre,13)\n\n           curr_dp(new_mod) = mod(curr_dp(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD)\n\n       end do\n\n   end if\n\n   dp_prev = curr_dp\n\nThis way, for each digit (or the single digit if not '?'), we loop over all pre and add to the new_mod.\n\nThis might be more accurate.\n\nBut in any case, the key is to compute the DP correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, sum1, count, MOD = 1000000007\n\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   character(len=20) :: input_str\n\n   !

The current code computes it via a loop multiplying by 10 each time. But this is inefficient for large i. However, since the maximum input_str length is probably small (since it's the count from the second program, which is the minimal between two counts, which can't be too big), this should be okay. Alternatively, precompute the powers of 10 mod13.\n\nAlternatively, compute base as follows:\n\nbase = 1\n\ndo j=1, i-1\n\n   base = mod(base *10,13)\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother issue: in the process_third function, the chars_reversed array is allocated with len, but the input_str may have leading spaces? No, because we used adjustl earlier, so the input_str is trimmed. So len_trim(input_str) is correct.\n\nWait, in the third function's input_str is the string of the count, which is written with adjustl, so it has no leading spaces. So the len is correct.\n\nAnother point: in the process_third function, the initial dp_prev is set to 0 except dp_prev(0)=1. That's correct.\n\nThen, for each step i from 1 to len:\n\n   current_char is chars_reversed(i), which is the ith character from the end of the original string.\n\n   compute base as 10^(i-1) mod13.\n\n   then process the current character.\n\n   curr_dp is initialized to 0.\n\n   if current_char is '?', loop over all digits 0-9, and for each, loop over all pre.\n\n   else, get the digit d from current_char, then loop over all pre.\n\n   then, set dp_prev to curr_dp for next step.\n\nFinally, the result is dp_prev(5) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the final result is dp[cs.length-1][5], which in Fortran's terms would be dp_prev(5) after processing all characters.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing possible issues:\n\nIn the process_third function, when current_char is not '?', we read it as an integer d via read(current_char, '(i1)'). But if current_char is a character like '5', this should work. However, in Fortran, if the character is not a digit, this would cause an error. But in our case, the input_str is the string of the count (from the second program's output, which is an integer), so the characters are digits. So it's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the process_third function, the chars_reversed array is allocated as len, but the loop for i=1 to len is correct.\n\nNow, compiling and testing this code may have some issues, but this is the general approach.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part, the array a is sorted in ascending order. The sort function in Fortran may sort in ascending order by default. The intrinsic function 'sort' in Fortran is available in F90 and later. However, the exact syntax may vary. For example:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nBut in some compilers, you might need to use the 'merge_sort' or other methods. Alternatively, use the 'sort' function with a comparison function. Alternatively, use a bubble sort for simplicity.\n\nWait, perhaps the code may not work if the sort is not properly implemented. Let me think of an alternative.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge_sort' function. But to be safe, perhaps implement a simple bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function. Let me check:\n\nIn Fortran, the sort function is part of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or is it a compiler-specific function?\n\nActually, Fortran does not have a built-in sort function. Oh, right! I forgot that. So I need to implement the sorting manually.\n\nOh, that's a problem. So the first part requires sorting the array a in ascending order. Since there's no built-in sort, I need to write a sorting routine.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let's think of a simple bubble sort for small n.\n\nAlternatively, use a selection sort.\n\nLet me implement a bubble sort for the array a.\n\nIn the first part:\n\nAfter reading the array a, perform a bubble sort.\n\nsubroutine bubble_sort(arr, n)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   integer :: i, j, temp\n\n   do i =1, n-1\n\n      do j =1, n-i\n\n          if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n              temp = arr(j)\n\n              arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n\n              arr(j+1) = temp\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine bubble_sort\n\nThen, in the main program:\n\ncall bubble_sort(a, n)\n\nThis should sort the array in ascending order.\n\nSo modifying the first part:\n\n   read *, n, k\n\n   allocate(a(n))\n\n   read *, a\n\n   call bubble_sort(a, n)\n\n   sum1 = sum(a(1:k))\n\nNow, the bubble_sort subroutine must be included in the program.\n\nSo adding that to the contains section.\n\nPutting it all together, the full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, sum1, count, MOD = 1000000007\n\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   character(len=20) :: input_str\n\n   !

So the 'current_char == '?' ' condition will never be true. But the third program's original code is for a problem where the input can have '?', but in this sequence, the input is the count's string, which has no '?'. So the code will handle it correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the process_third function, the chars_reversed array is allocated with len, but the loop for i=1 to len is correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs would be necessary, but given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the process_third function, the base calculation for each i is done via a loop. For i up to say 20, this is manageable.\n\nThus, this should be the correct Fortran translation."
