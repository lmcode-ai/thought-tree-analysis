Then, the calculation of res is:\n\nres = sum over i from 0 to 9 of cnt(i) * cnt(20 - i) (since 20 -i is the complement to 20, but the original code in Java loops from i=0 to 9 (since 10 pairs with 10, handled separately).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_131_B) reads an integer n, then n integers, counts their occurrences in a range from -10 to 10 (since the array is from 0 to 20, shifted by +10). Then it calculates a result based on pairs of numbers that add up to 10, and adds the combinations of two 10s. The output is this result.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC051_A) takes a string input, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so how does that connect? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. The first program's output is the 'res' value, which is a number. Then the second program takes that number as input? But the second program expects a string (since it reads a line and replaces commas). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a string, but in the first Java code, the output is a number printed with System.out.println(res), so it's a number. The second program expects a string input, so perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, which would read it as a line. But the second program's code replaces commas with spaces. Wait, but if the first program outputs a number like 123, then the second program would read that as \"123\" (without commas), so the output would be the same. But maybe the first program's output is a string with commas? Wait, no, the first program's output is just a number. So perhaps the second program is not part of the sequence? Or maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which then processes it, and the second's output is the input to the third, and the third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string (since it reads a line). The first program's output is a number printed as a line, so the second program would read that line as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program would read \"123\" and replace commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, it would output \"123\". So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. Then the third program would take that number as input? Wait, the third program expects an integer input (since it reads with Scanner in.nextInt()). So the second program's output is a number (the same as first's output), so the third program can read it as an integer. Wait, but the second program's output is the string with commas replaced by spaces. Wait, but if the first program's output is a number like 123, then the second program's output is the same, so the third program can read it as an integer. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is a number (res). Second program takes that number as input (as a string), replaces commas with spaces (but there are none), so outputs the same number as a string. Third program reads that number as an integer y, then processes it.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is codeforces_678_B, which takes an integer y as input, and then calculates the next year where some condition is met. So the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is the same as the first's output. So the entire sequence's input is the input to the first program, and the output is the third program's output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran, but without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input for first program (n and n integers).\n2. Process first program's logic: count occurrences in the array, compute res.\n3. Then, process second program's logic: take res (as a string?), replace commas with spaces. But since res is a number, it has no commas, so the result is the same string.\n4. Then, process third program's logic: take the number from the second's output (which is the same as first's res), and compute the required year.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the string with commas replaced by spaces. Since the first program's output is a number, which doesn't have commas, the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the third program's input is that number. So the second program's processing is redundant here, but we have to include it as per the sequence.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing res from the first step, we need to pass it through the second step's processing (even though it's a no-op here), then pass the result to the third step.\n\nWait, but in the second step, the input is the string representation of res. So in Fortran, after computing res (the first step's result), we need to convert it to a string, replace commas with spaces (though there are none), then convert back to an integer for the third step? Or perhaps the second step's processing is just a pass-through, but we have to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is necessary even if it does nothing here. So in the Fortran code, after the first step's res is computed, we need to process it through the second step's logic (even if it's a no-op here), then pass the result to the third step.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n- Read n and the array of numbers (for first program's input).\n- Compute the first program's res.\n- Convert res to a string, replace commas with spaces (second step).\n- Convert the resulting string back to an integer (since third program expects an integer input).\n- Compute the third program's result based on that integer.\n- Output the third program's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first program's logic:\n\nThe first program counts the occurrences of each number in the input array (each number is between -10 and 10, since the array is indexed from 0 to 20, with +10 offset). The counts are stored in cnt(1 to 21?), but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but maybe we can adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, the cnt array is of size 21 (indices 0 to 20). The numbers are read as integers, then added 10 to get the index. So for a number x, the index is x + 10. So for x from -10 to 10, the index ranges from 0 to 20. So in Fortran, perhaps we can have an array of size 21, with indices 0 to 20 (but in Fortran, arrays start at 1 unless specified). Hmm, so maybe we need to declare the array with a lower bound of 0. Alternatively, shift the indices.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use an array of size 21, with indices 1 to 21, and adjust the offset accordingly. Let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor each input number x, cnt[x+10] +=1.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is cnt(0:20), then same as Java. But in Fortran, arrays can be declared with a starting index. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:20) :: cnt\n\nThen, for each x, cnt(x+10) +=1.\n\nThen, the calculation of res is:\n\nres = sum over i from 0 to 9 of cnt(i) * cnt(20 - i) (since 20 -i is the complement to 20, but the original code in Java loops from i=0 to 9 (since 10 pairs with 10, handled separately). Wait, in the Java code, the first loop is for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { res += cnt[i] * cnt[20 - i]; }\n\nWait, 20 -i is because the indices are offset by +10. So for example, if the original numbers are a and b, such that a + b = 10, then (a+10) + (b+10) = a + b + 20 = 30? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the original problem for the first Java program is probably counting pairs of numbers that add up to 10. Let me think:\n\nSuppose two numbers x and y such that x + y = 10. Then, their indices in the cnt array are (x+10) and (y+10). So x + y =10 \u2192 y =10 -x \u2192 (y+10) = 20 -x. So the product cnt[x+10] * cnt[y+10] = cnt[x+10] * cnt[20 -x]. So for each x from -10 to 9 (since y would be 10 -x, which must be >=-10 and <=10). Wait, but in the code, the loop is for i from 0 to 9 (since i is the index, which is x+10, so x = i-10. So when i ranges from 0 to 9, x ranges from -10 to -1. Then y =10 -x \u2192 10 - (i-10) = 20 -i. So the code loops over i from 0 to 9 (so x from -10 to -1), and multiplies cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i], which is the count for x and y=10-x. Then, the case where x=10 and y=0 (but that's covered when x is 0, but wait, no, because when x is 10, then y would be 0, but x can't be 10 unless the input has a 10. Wait, perhaps the code is considering all pairs where x + y =10, but the loop is only for i from 0 to 9 (so x from -10 to -1?), but maybe I'm getting confused here. Anyway, the code's logic is as written, so in Fortran, we can replicate it.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would be:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array. Then, initialize cnt(0:20) to zero. Then loop over each number, add 10 to it, and increment cnt at that index. Then compute res as per the loops.\n\nNow, the second program's processing: take the res (the first program's output), convert it to a string, replace commas with spaces, then output that string. But in the sequence, this output is the input to the third program, which expects an integer. So the second program's output is the string version of res with commas replaced by spaces. But since res is a number, it has no commas, so the string is the same as the original. So the third program's input is the same as the first's res. However, in the code, we have to model this step.\n\nIn Fortran, after computing res (the first program's result), we need to:\n\n- Convert res to a string (character variable), then replace any commas with spaces. Since there are none, it remains the same.\n\nThen, the third program takes this string as input (as an integer). So in Fortran, after processing the second step, we can just keep the same value, but perhaps we need to ensure that the input to the third step is the same as the second's output. Since the second's output is the same as the first's res, we can just pass res to the third step.\n\nWait, but the third program expects an integer input. So the second step's output is a string (the number as a string with commas replaced by spaces, which is the same as the original number's string). The third program would read that string as an integer. So in Fortran, after the first step, we can just pass the res to the third step's processing, since the second step doesn't change it. But we have to make sure that the second step is properly modeled, even if it's a no-op here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program could have an input that has commas, but in the first program's output, there are none. So in the Fortran code, the second step is just a pass-through, but we have to code it.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first step's res is computed, we can do:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_res\nwrite(str_res, '(I0)') res\nstr_res = adjustl(str_res)  ! To remove leading spaces, but maybe not needed\n! Replace commas with spaces. Since there are none, this does nothing.\nstr_res = replace_commas(str_res)\n! Then, convert back to integer for the third step\nread(str_res, *) y\n\nBut the replace_commas function would be a subroutine that replaces commas with spaces. Alternatively, in Fortran, we can do:\n\nstr_res = replace(str_res, ',', ' ')\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in replace function, so we need to write a loop.\n\nAlternatively, since in this case, the input has no commas, perhaps we can skip that step, but the code must still perform it as per the sequence.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsubroutine replace_commas(s)\n  character(len=*), intent(inout) :: s\n  integer :: i\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n     if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n     end if\n  end do\nend subroutine\n\nThen, after converting res to a string, call replace_commas on it, then read back to y.\n\nBut since the first program's output is a number without commas, this is redundant, but necessary for correctness.\n\nNow, the third program's logic: given y, find the next year after y where the total days from y+1 to that year, considering leap years, sum mod 7 is 0, and the leap status of the current and next year must be the same?\n\nWait, looking at the third Java code:\n\nThe third program's code is:\n\nint y = in.nextInt();\nboolean leap = check_leap(y);\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n    if (check_leap(i)) {\n        sum += 366;\n    } else {\n        sum += 365;\n    }\n    if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n        if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n            System.out.println(i);\n            return;\n        } else {\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the condition is that sum mod 7 is zero, and the leap status of the current year (i) must be the same as the original year's leap status (leap). Wait, the condition is:\n\nif ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) \u2192 which is equivalent to (check_leap(i) == leap). So the leap status of the current year (i) must be the same as the original year's leap status (y's leap status).\n\nWait, but why? The original code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me see:\n\nThe loop starts at i = y+1. For each i, we add days (365 or 366) to sum. When sum mod7 is zero, then check if the leap status of i is same as the original y's leap status. If so, output i and exit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the next year where the total days from y+1 to that year is a multiple of 7, and the leap status of that year is same as the original year's leap status.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step's code would need to:\n\n- Take y (the input from the second step's output)\n- Compute leap = check_leap(y)\n- Initialize sum =0\n- Loop over i from y+1 upwards:\n   for each i:\n      compute days = 366 if leap_year(i) else 365\n      add to sum\n      if mod(sum,7) ==0:\n          if (leap_year(i) == leap):\n              output i and exit\n          else:\n              continue\n\nThe check_leap function is:\n\nstatic boolean check_leap(int y) {\n    return y % 400 ==0 || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n}\n\nIn Fortran, a function:\n\nlogical function is_leap(y)\n   integer, intent(in) :: y\n   if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n      is_leap = .true.\n   else if (mod(y,100) ==0) then\n      is_leap = .false.\n   else if (mod(y,4) ==0) then\n      is_leap = .true.\n   else\n      is_leap = .false.\n   end if\nend function\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the input for the first program (n and n integers), process all steps, and output the third's result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the array of integers (for first program's input).\n2. Compute the first program's res.\n3. Process the second step (convert res to string, replace commas with spaces, then read back as integer y).\n4. Compute the third program's result using y.\n5. Output the result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n, then n integers. Let's declare an array for the numbers.\n\ninteger :: n, i, x\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: numbers\n\nRead n, then allocate numbers(n), then read the numbers.\n\nThen, compute the cnt array (0:20).\n\ninteger :: cnt(0:20) = 0\ndo i =1, n\n   x = numbers(i)\n   cnt(x +10) = cnt(x+10) +1\nend do\n\nThen compute res:\n\ninteger :: res =0\ndo i=0,9\n   res = res + cnt(i)*cnt(20 -i)\nend do\nres = res + (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2\n\nThen, process the second step:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_res\nwrite(str_res, '(I0)') res\ncall replace_commas(str_res)\nread(str_res, *) y\n\nThe replace_commas subroutine:\n\nsubroutine replace_commas(s)\n  character(len=*), intent(inout) :: s\n  integer :: i\n  do i =1, len_trim(s)\n     if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n     end if\n  end do\nend subroutine\n\nThen, process the third step:\n\nlogical :: leap\nleap = is_leap(y)\ninteger :: sum_days =0\ninteger :: i_year\ndo i_year = y+1, huge(i_year)\n   if (is_leap(i_year)) then\n      sum_days = sum_days +366\n   else\n      sum_days = sum_days +365\n   end if\n   if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n      if (is_leap(i_year) .eqv. leap) then\n         print *, i_year\n         stop\n      end if\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop is infinite until it finds the condition. So in Fortran, we can loop indefinitely until the condition is met. The loop can be a do-while or just a do loop with exit.\n\nAlternatively, use a do loop with an upper bound that's large enough, but since we don't know how far it might go, perhaps better to use an infinite loop with an exit when found.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: i_year\ndo i_year = y+1, huge(i_year)\n   ... compute days ...\n   if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n      if (is_leap(i_year) == leap) then\n         print *, i_year\n         stop\n      end if\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop with huge(i_year) is a very large number, but it's better to use an infinite loop with an exit.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ninteger :: i_year = y+1\ndo\n   if (is_leap(i_year)) then\n      sum_days = sum_days +366\n   else\n      sum_days = sum_days +365\n   end if\n   if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n      if (is_leap(i_year) .eqv. leap) then\n         print *, i_year\n         stop\n      end if\n   end if\n   i_year = i_year +1\nend do\n\nThis way, it loops indefinitely until the condition is met.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram sequence\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, x\n  integer, allocatable :: numbers(:)\n  integer :: cnt(0:20) = 0\n  integer :: res, y\n  character(len=20) :: str_res\n  logical :: leap\n\n  !

Second program's processing\n  write(str_res, '(I0)') res\n  call replace_commas(str_res)\n  read(str_res, *) y\n\n  ! Third program's processing\n  leap = is_leap(y)\n  integer :: sum_days =0\n  integer :: i_year = y+1\n\n  do\n     if (is_leap(i_year)) then\n        sum_days = sum_days +366\n     else\n        sum_days = sum_days +365\n     end if\n     if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n        if (is_leap(i_year) .eqv. leap) then\n           print *, i_year\n           stop\n        end if\n     end if\n     i_year = i_year +1\n  end do\n\ncontains\n\n  logical function is_leap(y)\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n       is_leap = .true.\n    else if (mod(y,100) ==0) then\n       is_leap = .false.\n    else if (mod(y,4) ==0) then\n       is_leap = .true.\n    else\n       is_leap = .false.\n    end if\n  end function is_leap\n\n  subroutine replace_commas(s)\n    character(len=*), intent(inout) :: s\n    integer :: i\n    do i =1, len_trim(s)\n       if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n          s(i:i) = ' '\n       end if\n    end do\n  end subroutine replace_commas\n\nend program sequence\n\nWait, but in the third step's loop, the initial sum_days is 0. Let me check:\n\nThe third program's code starts with sum =0, and for each i starting at y+1, adds days for that year. So the first iteration adds the days of i = y+1, then checks sum mod7. So the code above is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 123. The second program converts it to \"123\", which is read as y=123. The third program processes that.\n\nAnother case: if the first program's output has a comma, like 1,234 (but in Java, the first program's output is a number, which would be printed as 1234, so no commas. So the second program's processing is a no-op here.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The replace_commas function may have to handle leading or trailing spaces, but since the write statement uses '(I0)', the string should have no leading spaces. The replace_commas function loops over the trimmed length, so it's okay.\n\n- The third program's loop must increment i_year each time. The code does that.\n\n- The is_leap function is correctly implemented.\n\n- The first program's cnt array is properly initialized to zero. In Fortran, the =0 in the declaration initializes all elements to zero, so that's okay.\n\n- The third program's loop is an infinite loop until it finds the condition. Since the problem's third program's code uses a similar loop, it should work.\n\nNow, check for possible errors in the code:\n\nIn the first program's loop for res calculation:\n\nThe loop for i from 0 to 9 (in Fortran, the loop variable i is from 0 to 9, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based unless declared otherwise. Wait, the cnt array is declared as cnt(0:20), so indices 0 to 20. So the loop in Fortran for i from 0 to 9 is okay.\n\nYes, because in the first program's code, the loop is for (int i=0; i<10; i++), which is 0 to 9 inclusive. So in Fortran, the loop is do i=0,9.\n\nThe second term in res is (cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1))/2 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nThe third program's leap check for the current year (i_year) must be compared to the original leap status (leap). The code uses is_leap(i_year) .eqv. leap, which is correct.\n\nThe sum_days is accumulated correctly.\n\nThe third program's loop starts at i_year = y+1, and increments each time. The code uses a do loop with i_year initialized before the loop, and increments inside.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work."
