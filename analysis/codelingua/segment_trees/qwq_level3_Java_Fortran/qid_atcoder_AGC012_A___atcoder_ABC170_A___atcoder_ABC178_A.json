    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file (AGC012_A). It reads an integer n, then an array of 3n integers. It sorts the array, then takes every second element starting from the second last element (since head starts at length-2, which is the index of the second last element in a zero-based array). It sums those elements. The output is this sum.\n\nThe second Java file (ABC170_A) reads a line of space-separated numbers. It counts how many numbers there are until it hits a \"0\", then outputs that count. Wait, actually, the code increments the count for each string in the array, but breaks when it encounters \"0\". So if the input is like \"1 2 0 3\", the count would be 3 (since it stops at the third element, which is \"0\"). Wait, no, the loop is over all elements, but breaks when a \"0\" is found. So the count is the number of elements until and including the first \"0\". Wait, the code is: for each string in the array, add 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", break. So for input \"0\", the result is 1. For \"1 0 2\", it would count 2 (since after the first \"0\", it breaks). So the second program's output is the count of elements up to and including the first occurrence of 0.\n\nThe third Java file (ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1. If x is 1, then bool is true, so result is 0 (since !bool would be false, so 0). If x is not 1, then result is 1. So the output is 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nNow, the three Java programs are run in sequence, with each program's output being the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process all three steps internally, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the data flow between the programs.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. First Java program (File1) takes input n and 3n integers. It outputs a sum (res).\n\n2. Second Java program (File2) takes that sum as input (as a single number?), but wait, the second program expects a line of space-separated numbers. Wait, the first program's output is a single number (the sum). So the second program's input is that single number as a line, which would be a single element. So the input to the second program is a line with that sum as a string. So the second program would split into an array with one element (the sum as a string). Then, it counts how many elements until a \"0\" is found. So if the sum is 0, then the count is 1. Otherwise, since the first element is not 0, the loop would process it, add 1, then check if it's 0. If not, the loop continues, but since there are no more elements, the loop ends. Wait, no, the loop is over all elements in the array. So if the input is \"5\", then the array has one element \"5\", so the loop runs once, adds 1, then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" (no), so the loop continues? Wait no, the loop is a for-each loop over the array. So for each element in the array, it increments the count and checks if the element is \"0\". If it is, break. So for input \"5\", the count is 1, since the element is not 0, so the loop completes, and the result is 1. If the input was \"0\", then the count is 1. If the input was \"0 1 2\", then the first element is 0, so count becomes 1, then breaks, so the result is 1. Wait, but the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a single number. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is 1 unless that number is 0, in which case it's 1 as well. Wait, no, if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's input is \"0\", so the count is 1. If the first program's output is non-zero, then the count is 1. Wait, that's strange. Wait, the second program's code is:\n\nresult starts at 0. For each string in the array (split from the input line), add 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", break. So for input \"5\", the array has one element \"5\". The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then check if \"5\" is \"0\" (no), so loop ends. So the result is 1. If the input is \"0\", then the first element is \"0\": result becomes 1, then break, so the result is 1. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1 except when the input is empty? Wait, no. Wait, if the input line is empty, then the array is empty, so the loop doesn't run, so result remains 0. But the first program's output is a number, so the input to the second program can't be empty. So the second program's output is always 1, except when the input is \"0\", which also gives 1. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second program's input. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the second program's input is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a single integer (the sum). So the second program's input is a line containing that integer. So the input line is, say, \"123\", which when split by spaces gives an array with one element. So the second program's result is 1 unless the first program's output is 0, in which case the result is 1 as well. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be. Wait, no, if the first program's output is 0, then the input to the second is \"0\", so the array has one element \"0\". The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then since the string is \"0\", it breaks. So the result is 1. So yes, the second program's output is always 1, regardless of the input. Wait, that's strange. Then the third program would take that 1 as input. The third program's code is: x is the input (so 1), then checks if x is 1. So the result is 0. So the final output is 0. Wait, but if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's output is 1, so the third program's input is 1, so output is 0. If the first program's output is 5, then second's output is 1, so third's output is 0. Only if the second program's output is 0 would the third program output 1. But the second program can't output 0. Because the second program's result starts at 0, and increments for each element until a 0 is found. The minimal result is 1 (if the first element is 0, then it's 1). If the input is empty, then result is 0, but that's not possible here. So the second program's output is always at least 1. So the third program's input is always >=1, so the third program's output is 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the third program's code is:\n\nx = input (as integer). Then bool is (x ==1). Then result is !bool ? 1 :0. Wait, let me parse that code again:\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false; // so bool is true if x is 1, else false.\n\nThen result = !bool ? 1 :0. So if bool is true (x is 1), then !bool is false, so result is 0. If bool is false (x not 1), then !bool is true, so result is 1. So the third program's output is 1 unless the input is 1, in which case it's 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe entire chain's output is 0 if the second program's output is 1 (since the third program's input is 1, so output is 0). Wait, but the second program's output is always 1, so the third program's output is always 0. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nFirst program's output is S (sum). Second program's input is S. The second program's output is the count of elements until the first 0. Since the input is a single number S, the array has one element. So the count is 1 unless S is 0. Wait, no, even if S is 0, the count is 1. Because the first element is \"0\", so the loop runs once, adds 1, then breaks. So the count is 1. So the second program's output is always 1. Therefore, the third program's input is 1, so its output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0, except when the second program's output is not 1? Wait, but that's impossible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose the first program's output is 5. Then the second program's input is \"5\", so the array is [\"5\"], so the loop runs once, adds 1, then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" (no), so the loop ends. The result is 1. So the third program's input is 1, so output is 0.\n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the second program's input is \"0\", so the array is [\"0\"], so the loop runs once, adds 1, then breaks. The result is 1. So third program's input is 1, so output is 0.\n\nWait, so in all cases, the final output is 0. That's strange. Unless there's a case where the second program's output is not 1. For example, if the first program's output is a number like 10, but the second program's input is \"10\", so the array has one element, so the count is 1. So the third program's output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0, regardless of the first program's input. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the second program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the second Java program's code again:\n\nThe second program's code is:\n\nBufferedReader br = ...;\nString[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\nint result =0;\nfor (String str : input_array) {\n    result +=1;\n    if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n}\npw.println(result);\n\nSo for each element in the array, it adds 1 to result, then checks if the element is \"0\". If yes, break. So the loop stops at the first occurrence of \"0\".\n\nSo the result is the number of elements from the start up to and including the first \"0\".\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"1 2 3\", then the array has three elements. The loop runs for each element:\n\nFirst element: result becomes 1, not 0 \u2192 continue.\n\nSecond: result 2 \u2192 continue.\n\nThird: result 3 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 continue. So after all elements, the result is 3.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous understanding. Oh! Oh right! The loop is over all elements, but breaks when a \"0\" is found. So the result is the count of elements until and including the first \"0\". If there is no \"0\", then it counts all elements.\n\nWait, so in the case where the first program's output is 5, the second program's input is \"5\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" \u2192 no. So the loop continues? Wait, no, the for-each loop is over all elements. So after processing the first element, the loop ends because there are no more elements. So the result is 1. So the second program's output is 1.\n\nBut if the first program's output is 0, then the input is \"0\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then since the string is \"0\", it breaks. So the result is 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is \"0 1 2\", but that's impossible because the first program's output is a single number. Wait, the first program's output is a single integer. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is always the count of elements until the first 0. Since the input is a single number, the count is 1 unless that number is 0, in which case it's 1. So the second program's output is always 1. So the third program's input is always 1, so the output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0, regardless of the input. That's a bit odd, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another scenario. Suppose the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's output is 1, so third program's input is 1 \u2192 output 0. If the first program's output is 100, then second's output is 1 \u2192 third's output 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0. That's strange. But according to the code, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe the second program's input is not just the first program's output. Wait, the first program's output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. So the input line is that number. So the split into array is one element. So the second program's output is always 1. So the third program's input is 1, so output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0. So the final Fortran program must output 0 regardless of the input? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program's code again.\n\nFirst program:\n\nReads n, then 3n integers. Sorts the array. Then starts at head = array.length -2 (since array is 3n elements, so length-2 is 3n-2). Then for i from 0 to n-1, adds array[head] to res, then head -=2. So the first element taken is array[3n-2], then 3n-4, etc., n times. So the sum is the sum of the n largest even-indexed elements? Wait, let's see:\n\nAfter sorting the array in ascending order, the largest elements are at the end. The head starts at 3n-2 (the second last element). Then each step takes that element, subtracts 2 from head. So for n elements, the indices taken are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., down to 3n-2 - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. So the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., n. So the elements are the second last, then second to last minus two, etc., for n elements. So the sum is the sum of the n elements starting from the second last, stepping back two each time. Since the array is sorted, these are the n largest elements, but every other one. Wait, let's see with an example.\n\nSuppose n=2, so array has 6 elements. After sorting, the array is [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]. The indices are 0 to 5. The head starts at 5-2=3 (since array.length is 6, so 6-2=4? Wait wait, array.length is 3n, so for n=2, it's 6. So head is 6-2 =4? Wait, 3n-2? Wait, array.length is 3n, so array.length-2 is 3n-2. So for n=2, that's 6-2=4. So the first element is index 4 (a5), then head becomes 2 (4-2), so next is index 2 (a3). So the sum is a5 + a3. So the two largest elements (a5 and a6 are the two largest, but here a5 is taken, then a3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the array is sorted in ascending order. So the elements are in order from smallest to largest. The largest element is at index 3n-1. The second largest is at 3n-2. The third largest is 3n-3, etc. So the head starts at 3n-2 (the second largest). Then each step takes that element, then subtracts 2. So for n elements, the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., down to 3n-2 - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. So the elements are the second largest, fourth largest, etc. So for n=2, the elements are the second and fourth largest. Wait, but in the example with 6 elements, the second largest is index 4 (since 0-based), and then subtract 2 gives index 2. So the elements are a4 (second largest?), no, wait the largest is a5 (index5), second is a4 (index4), third a3 (index3), fourth a2 (index2). So for n=2, the sum is a4 + a2. Hmm, but that's not the largest elements. So the first program's output is the sum of every other element starting from the second largest, stepping back two each time, for n elements. \n\nBut regardless of that, the second program's output is always 1, so the third program's output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0. So the final Fortran program must output 0 regardless of the input? That seems odd, but perhaps that's the case. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the second program's input. Let me think again. The first program's output is a single integer. The second program reads that as a line, splits into an array of strings. So if the first program outputs, say, 10, then the input line is \"10\", so the array has one element. The count is 1. If the first program outputs 0, then the array has one element \"0\", so the count is 1. So yes, the second program's output is always 1. So the third program's input is 1, so output is 0. So the entire chain's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program must read the input (n and 3n integers), process all three steps, and output 0. But that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the second program's code?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the second Java program's code again. The code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC170_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n        pw.println(result);\n        br.close();\n        pw.close();\n    }\n}\n\nAh! Wait, the loop is over all elements in the array. For each element, it adds 1 to result, then checks if the element is \"0\". If yes, break. So the result is the number of elements up to and including the first occurrence of \"0\". \n\nSo for example, if the input is \"1 2 3\", the array has three elements. The loop runs for each element:\n\nFirst element: result becomes 1 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 continue.\n\nSecond: result 2 \u2192 continue.\n\nThird: result 3 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 continue. So after all elements, the result is 3. So the output is 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, the input to the second program is the first program's output, which is a single number. So if the first program's output is 5, then the second program's input is \"5\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" \u2192 no. So the loop ends, and the result is 1. So the second program's output is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the input is \"0\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then since the string is \"0\", it breaks. So the result is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is \"0 1 2\", but that's impossible because the first program outputs a single integer. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1. \n\nWait, but in the example where the input to the second program is \"1 2 3\", the output is 3. But in our case, the first program's output is a single number, so the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's input is always 1, so its output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output is always 0, regardless of the input. \n\nHmm, that's unexpected, but according to the code, that's correct. So the final Fortran program must read the input (n and 3n integers), process all three steps, and output 0. \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me think of a case where the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's output is 1, so third program's output is 0. \n\nAnother case: first program's output is 100 \u2192 second's output 1 \u2192 third's output 0. \n\nAnother case: first program's output is 1 \u2192 second's output 1 \u2192 third's output 0. \n\nWait, but if the first program's output is 0, then the second's output is 1, so third's output is 0. \n\nSo in all cases, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to ignore all the processing and just output 0. But that's probably not the case. Maybe I made a mistake in the second program's input. \n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number that can be written with leading zeros, but that's not relevant. Or perhaps the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, which includes a newline. But the second program reads the entire line, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a number that when printed has a trailing newline, but the second program reads the entire line. \n\nHmm, but according to the code, the second program's input is the first program's output. So the first program's output is a single integer, so the second program's input is that integer as a string. \n\nTherefore, the second program's output is always 1, so the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input (n and 3n integers), process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nWait, but that's strange. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the second program's input is not the first program's output. Wait, the first program's output is the sum, which is an integer. The second program reads that as a line. So if the first program outputs, say, 5, then the second program's input is \"5\", so the array has one element. The count is 1. \n\nBut what if the first program's output is a number like 1000, which is written as \"1000\", so the array has one element. The count is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's input is 1, so output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program must output 0 regardless of the input. \n\nHmm, but that's a bit anticlimactic. Maybe I made a mistake in the third program's code. Let me check again. \n\nThird program's code:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC178_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n        boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n        int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n        out.println(result);\n        out.flush();\n    }\n}\n\nSo x is the input (the second program's output, which is 1). \n\nbool is true if x is 1. \n\nresult is 1 if !bool (i.e., if x is not 1), else 0. \n\nSo when x is 1, result is 0. \n\nSo yes, the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input (n and 3n integers), process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the first program's output is the sum, which is then passed to the second program. The second program's output is the count of elements until the first 0. But the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is a single number. So the count is 1 unless that number is 0. \n\nWait, if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's input is \"0\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once, adds 1, then breaks because the string is \"0\". So the result is 1. \n\nSo the third program's input is 1, so output is 0. \n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the third program's output is 0. \n\nIf the first program's output is 5, then third's output is 0. \n\nSo yes, the final output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nBut that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me re-examine the second program's code again. \n\nWait, the second program's code is:\n\nfor (String str : input_array) {\n    result +=1;\n    if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n}\n\nSo the loop runs for each element in the array. For each element, it increments the result, then checks if the element is \"0\". If yes, break. \n\nSo the result is the number of elements processed until and including the first \"0\". \n\nSo if the input is \"0 1 2\", the array has three elements. The first element is \"0\", so result becomes 1, then break. So the result is 1. \n\nIf the input is \"1 0 2\", the first element is \"1\" \u2192 result 1, not 0 \u2192 continue. Second element is \"0\" \u2192 result becomes 2, then break. So the result is 2. \n\nAh! Wait, in this case, the input to the second program is a line like \"1 0 2\", then the result is 2. \n\nBut in our case, the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is a single number. So the array has one element. \n\nSo the second program's output is 1 unless the first program's output is 0, in which case the second program's output is 1. \n\nWait, no. If the first program's output is 0, then the input is \"0\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then since the string is \"0\", it breaks. So the result is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is 100, then the input is \"100\", so the array has one element. The loop runs once: result becomes 1, then since the string is not \"0\", the loop ends. So the result is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's input is always 1, so output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire chain's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input (n and 3n integers), process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nBut that's strange. Maybe the problem is that the second program's input is not the first program's output. Wait, the first program's output is the sum, which is an integer. The second program reads that as a line. So the input to the second program is a single number. \n\nTherefore, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to read the input, process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me re-examine the first program's code again. \n\nFirst program's code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nint[] array = new int[3 * n];\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) array[i] = sc.nextInt();\nArrays.sort(array);\nint head = array.length - 2;\nlong res = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    res += array[head];\n    head -= 2;\n}\nSystem.out.println(res);\n\nSo the array is sorted in ascending order. The head starts at 3n-2 (since array.length is 3n). \n\nThen, for each of the n iterations, it takes array[head], adds to res, then head -=2. \n\nSo the indices taken are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., down to 3n-2 - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. \n\nSo the elements are the second last, fourth last, etc., for n elements. \n\nThe sum of those elements. \n\nBut regardless of that sum, the second program's output is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, process all steps, but the final output is 0. \n\nBut the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So the Fortran program must read the input (n and 3n integers), process all three steps, and output the final result (which is 0). \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and 3n integers. \n\nProcess first program's steps (sort array, compute sum). \n\nThen process second program's steps (count elements until first 0, but since input is a single number, the count is 1). \n\nThen process third program's steps (output 0). \n\nBut since the second and third steps can be simplified, because the second's output is always 1, leading to third's output 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to read the input, process the first program's steps (even though it's not needed), and then output 0. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated, so even if the intermediate steps are redundant, they must be processed. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" \n\nSo even if the second and third steps are redundant, the Fortran program must process them. \n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and 3n integers. \n\n2. Sort the array. \n\n3. Compute the sum as per first program. \n\n4. Take that sum as the input to the second program. \n\n5. The second program's input is the sum as a string. So the second program's processing is to split into an array (which is one element), count until first 0 (so 1). \n\n6. Take that count (1) as input to the third program, which outputs 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must perform all these steps. \n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and 3n integers. \n\n- Sort the array. \n\n- Compute the sum (first program's result). \n\n- Then, process the second program's logic: the input is the sum as a string. So the second program's processing is to split into an array (which is one element), then count until first 0. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to represent this? \n\nWait, the second program's processing is to take the sum (from first program) as an input, then treat it as a string, split into an array of strings (split by spaces), then count the elements until the first \"0\". \n\nBut in Fortran, since the first program's output is a number, the second program's input is that number as a string. \n\nSo in the Fortran program, after computing the sum (first step's result), we need to process it as a string, split into tokens (split by spaces), then count the elements until the first \"0\". \n\nWait, but the sum is a single number, so when converted to a string, it's a single token. \n\nSo the second step's processing can be done as follows:\n\nTake the sum (integer), convert to a string, split into an array (which will have one element). \n\nThen, loop over the elements (only one), count until first \"0\". \n\nThe count will be 1 unless the sum is 0. \n\nWait, but in code, how to do this in Fortran? \n\nAlternatively, since the second program's output is always 1, except when the sum is 0 (then it's also 1), the second step's result is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third step's input is 1, so the third step's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to output 0 regardless of the input. \n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated, so even if the intermediate steps are redundant, they must be processed. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must perform all steps. \n\nSo let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, the first program's steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n and 3n integers. \n\nSort the array. \n\nCompute the sum as per first program. \n\nSecond program's steps: \n\nTake the sum (integer) and convert it to a string. \n\nSplit the string into an array of strings (split by spaces). \n\nLoop over the elements, count until first \"0\". \n\nThe count is the second program's output. \n\nThird program's steps: \n\nTake the count (second program's output) as x. \n\nIf x is 1, output 0. \n\nElse, output 1. \n\nWait, but the third program's code is: \n\nresult = !bool ? 1 :0 \n\nwhere bool is (x ==1). \n\nSo if x is 1 \u2192 result is 0. \n\nElse \u2192 1. \n\nSo the third program's output is 0 if the second program's output is 1, else 1. \n\nBut the second program's output is always 1 (since the input is a single number, which is either 0 or non-zero, but in both cases the count is 1). \n\nTherefore, the third program's output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to output 0. \n\nBut to comply with the problem's requirement of translating the entire sequence, even if redundant, we must process all steps. \n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are: \n\nRead n and 3n integers. \n\nSort the array. \n\nCompute the sum (first program's result). \n\nConvert the sum to a string. \n\nSplit the string into an array (split by spaces). \n\nCount the elements until first \"0\". \n\nTake that count as x. \n\nIf x is 1 \u2192 output 0. \n\nElse \u2192 output 1. \n\nBut since the count is always 1, the output is always 0. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows. \n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Fortran. \n\nFirst, read n and 3n integers. \n\nIn Fortran, we can read them into an array. \n\nSorting the array: Fortran has a sort function. \n\nCompute the sum as per first program's logic. \n\nThen, convert the sum to a string. \n\nSplit the string into tokens (split by spaces). \n\nIn Fortran, splitting a string by spaces can be done with a loop, but it's a bit involved. \n\nAlternatively, since the input to the second program is a single number, the string will have no spaces, so the array will have one element. \n\nTherefore, the count is 1 unless the string is \"0\". \n\nWait, the sum could be zero. \n\nSo the second program's count is 1 if the sum is zero (since the first element is \"0\"), or if it's non-zero (the first element is not \"0\"). \n\nSo the count is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the third program's output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to output 0. \n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated. \n\nTherefore, even though the intermediate steps are redundant, they must be present. \n\nTherefore, the code must process all steps. \n\nSo let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, read n and 3n integers. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead *, n \n\nThen read 3*n integers. \n\nBut in Fortran, you can read them into an array. \n\nThen sort the array. \n\nCompute the sum as per first program's logic. \n\nThen, convert the sum to a string. \n\nThen split the string into tokens (split by spaces). \n\nThen count the elements until first \"0\". \n\nThen take that count as x. \n\nThen output 0 if x is 1, else 1. \n\nBut since the count is always 1, the output is 0. \n\nBut to code this properly, let's proceed. \n\nFirst, the first part: \n\nRead n and 3n integers. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, array(3*n) \n\nBut in Fortran, the array size must be known at compile time. So this is a problem. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can use allocatable arrays. \n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: n \n\nread *, n \n\ninteger, allocatable :: array(:) \n\nallocate(array(3*n)) \n\nread *, array \n\nThen sort the array. \n\nFortran has the 'sort' intrinsic function. \n\ncall merge_sort(array) \n\nBut the exact function depends on the compiler. Alternatively, use the built-in sort function. \n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. \n\narray = sort(array) \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, use a loop to sort the array. \n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the easiest way is to use the 'sort' function. \n\nAssuming that the array can be sorted with array = sort(array). \n\nThen compute the sum. \n\nThe first program's sum is computed as follows: \n\nhead = 3*n - 2 \n\nres = 0 \n\ndo i = 1, n \n\n    res = res + array(head) \n\n    head = head - 2 \n\nend do \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. \n\nWait, in Java, the array is 0-based. \n\nSo in the first program's code, the array is 0-based. \n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based. \n\nTherefore, the head in Java is array.length -2 \u2192 which is 3n-2 (since array.length is 3n). \n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the last element is at 3n. \n\nSo the head in Fortran should be 3n -1 (the second last element). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's array has indices 0 to 3n-1. \n\nThe head starts at 3n-2 (second last element). \n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so indices 1 to 3n. \n\nThe second last element is at 3n-1. \n\nSo head starts at 3n-1 -1? No, wait:\n\nJava's head is array.length -2 \u2192 3n-2 \u2192 which is the second last element (since last is 3n-1). \n\nIn Fortran, the second last element is 3n-1 (since last is 3n). \n\nSo the head in Fortran should be 3n-1. \n\nThen, for each of the n steps, subtract 2. \n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ninteger :: head, res \n\nhead = 3*n -1 \n\nres = 0 \n\ndo i = 1, n \n\n    res = res + array(head) \n\n    head = head - 2 \n\nend do \n\nThen, the first program's result is res. \n\nNext, the second program's processing: \n\nTake the res (the sum) and convert it to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write statement into a character variable. \n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str \n\nwrite(str, '(I0)') res \n\nThen, split the string into tokens separated by spaces. \n\nBut since the string is just the number, there are no spaces. So the array will have one element. \n\nThen, count the elements until first \"0\". \n\nThe count is initialized to 0. \n\nLoop over each token in the array: \n\ncount = 0 \n\ndo i = 1, number_of_tokens \n\n    count = count +1 \n\n    if (token == '0') exit \n\nend do \n\nThe number_of_tokens is 1. \n\nSo the count will be 1 if the token is not \"0\", or 1 if it is \"0\" (since the first element is \"0\", so count becomes 1 and exits). \n\nThus, the count is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the second program's output is 1. \n\nThen, the third program's input is 1. \n\nThe third program's output is 0 if the input is 1, else 1. \n\nThus, the final output is 0. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows: \n\nprogram main \n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: n, i, res, head, count, x \n\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:) \n\n    read *, n \n\n    allocate(array(3*n)) \n\n    read *, array \n\n    ! Sort the array \n\n    call sort(array) \n\n    ! Compute first program's result \n\n    head = 3*n -1 \n\n    res = 0 \n\n    do i = 1, n \n\n        res = res + array(head) \n\n        head = head -2 \n\n    end do \n\n    ! Second program's processing \n\n    ! Convert res to string \n\n    character(len=20) :: str \n\n    write(str, '(I0)') res \n\n    ! Split into tokens (split by spaces) \n\n    ! Since there are no spaces, the array has one element \n\n    character(len=20), dimension(1) :: tokens \n\n    tokens(1) = trim(str) \n\n    ! Count until first \"0\" \n\n    count = 0 \n\n    do i = 1, 1 \n\n        count = count +1 \n\n        if (tokens(i) == '0') exit \n\n    end do \n\n    ! Third program's processing \n\n    x = count \n\n    if (x == 1) then \n\n        print *, 0 \n\n    else \n\n        print *, 1 \n\n    end if \n\nend program main \n\nWait, but in the second program's processing, the tokens array is just one element. \n\nAlternatively, since the string is just the number, we can directly check if the string is \"0\". \n\nBut the code above should work. \n\nHowever, in Fortran, the 'sort' function may not be available. \n\nWait, in Fortran, there is no built-in sort function. So I need to implement a sort. \n\nAh, right! That's a problem. \n\nSo I need to sort the array in Fortran. \n\nTherefore, I need to write a sorting routine. \n\nLet me think of a simple bubble sort for the array. \n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge_sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic function from the intrinsic procedures. \n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, there is a 'sort' function, but it's part of the intrinsic procedures. \n\nWait, according to the standard, the 'sort' function is available for arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as: \n\narray = sort(array) \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge_sort' function. \n\nAlternatively, implement a simple bubble sort. \n\nLet me write a bubble sort for the array. \n\nHere's a simple bubble sort subroutine: \n\nsubroutine bubble_sort(arr) \n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:) \n\n    integer :: i, j, temp, n \n\n    n = size(arr) \n\n    do i = 1, n-1 \n\n        do j = 1, n-i \n\n            if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then \n\n                temp = arr(j) \n\n                arr(j) = arr(j+1) \n\n                arr(j+1) = temp \n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n    end do \n\nend subroutine bubble_sort \n\nThen, in the main program, call this subroutine. \n\nSo the main program would have: \n\ncall bubble_sort(array) \n\nTherefore, the full code would be: \n\nprogram main \n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: n, i, res, head, count, x \n\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:) \n\n    read *, n \n\n    allocate(array(3*n)) \n\n    read *, array \n\n    !

Wait, n=1 \u2192 array has 3 elements. \n\nWait, let's take n=1 and array [0,0,0]. \n\nAfter sorting: [0,0,0]. \n\nhead = 3*1-1 =2 (array indices 1,2,3). \n\nFirst iteration: add array(2)=0 \u2192 res=0 \n\nSecond program's input is \"0\". \n\nThe token is \"0\". \n\nCount is 1 (since first element is \"0\", count becomes 1 and exits). \n\nThird program's output is 0. \n\nAnother example where first program's output is 0: \n\nn=1, array [0,0,0]. \n\nFirst program's sum is array[2] (second element in 1-based is 0). \n\nSo res=0. \n\nSecond program's input is \"0\" \u2192 count is 1. \n\nThird program's output is 0. \n\nAnother example where first program's output is 100: \n\nSecond program's input is \"100\" \u2192 count is 1 \u2192 third output 0. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nTherefore, this is the correct Fortran program."
