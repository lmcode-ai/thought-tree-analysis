Then:\n\nAfter first iteration (a=2): c=1, l=2. Second iteration (a=2): c becomes 2, l=2. Third iteration (a=3): not equal \u2192 c=1, l=3. Final c is 1. So if k=2, then 1+2=3>3? No. So output -1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_222_A) reads input values n, k, and then a sequence of n integers. It checks consecutive duplicates and calculates some condition involving c and k. The output is either n - c or -1. \n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string and processes it in two ways: one from left to right changing duplicates, counting changes (a1), and another from right to left (a2). It outputs the minimum of a1 and a2. \n\nThe third file (codeforces_514_A) takes a number, breaks it into digits, modifies each digit to the closest to 9 (if 9 - r is smaller than r), then constructs a new number from these digits and outputs it.\n\nThe key is to chain these three processes in Fortran without I/O in the middle. So the first part (Java File 1) will read the input, process it, then pass the result to the second part (Java File 2's logic), then to the third (Java File 3's logic), and finally output the result.\n\nWait, but how do the outputs of each Java program connect? Let me see:\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is the result of its calculation. But the second program's input is a string. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is either n - c or -1. That's a number. The second program expects a string as input (since it reads a string via in.next()). So that's a problem. Because the first program outputs a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then read as the string input for the second program? Or maybe the first program's output is a string? Wait, looking at the first Java code's output: it's either n - c (a number) or -1 (also a number). So the first program's output is a single integer. The second program expects a string as input. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's printing a number. So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then read as the input for the second program. But the second program's input is a string. So maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then converted into a string for the second program's input. Wait, but how does that work? Let me check the second Java program's code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's code: the first line in the solve method is String x = in.next(); So the input is a single string. So the first program's output must be a string that is the input to the second program. But the first program outputs a number. So the first program's output is a number, which is then read as a string by the second program. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program reads that as the string \"5\".\n\nThen the second program processes that string (like \"5\") and outputs a number (the minimum of a1 and a2). Then the third program takes that number as input. The third program expects a number as input (since it reads a long via nextLong()). So the second program's output is a number, which is read as the input for the third program. The third program processes it and outputs another number.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output1 (number) -> Program2 (reads Output1 as a string) -> Output2 (number) -> Program3 (reads Output2 as a number) -> Output3 (final number).\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input, process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (n, k, then n integers). \n\nWait, the first Java program's input is n, k, followed by n integers. So in Fortran, we need to read those first.\n\nThen process the first part (Java File1's logic) to compute the output (either n - c or -1). Let's call this result1.\n\nThen, pass result1 as the input to the second part (Java File2's logic). The second part expects a string, so in Fortran, we can treat result1 as a string (e.g., convert the integer to a string). The second part will process this string and output a number (the minimum of a1 and a2). Let's call this result2.\n\nThen, pass result2 to the third part (Java File3's logic). The third part reads a long (so the input is a number, which is result2). The third part processes it and outputs the final number (result3), which is printed.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (n, k, then n integers).\n\n- Compute result1 (from first Java code).\n\n- Convert result1 to a string (for the second step's input).\n\n- Process the second step (Java File2's logic) on that string, getting result2 (a number).\n\n- Convert result2 to a number (since third step expects a long).\n\n- Process the third step (Java File3's logic) on that number, getting result3.\n\n- Output result3.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (Java File1):\n\nThe first Java program's logic:\n\nRead n, k, then a sequence of n integers. Then track consecutive duplicates. The variables l (last) and c (current count). For each a in the sequence:\n\nif a == l, then c +=1, else c=1. Then l = a.\n\nAt the end, if c +k >n, output n -c, else -1.\n\nIn Fortran, we can do this as follows:\n\nRead n, k, then an array of n integers.\n\nInitialize l as the first element, c as 1. Then loop from the second element.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop starts at i=0, and l is initialized to 0. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nInitially, l is 0, c is 1. Wait, no:\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nint l =0, c=1;\n\nWait, the first iteration (i=0):\n\na = in.nextInt();\n\nthen check if a == l (which is 0). So for the first element, since l is 0, unless the first a is 0, c will reset to 1. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the code is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code for the first program:\n\nThe code initializes l=0, c=1. Then for each of the n elements:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a = in.nextInt();\n\n    if (a == l) c +=1;\n\n    else c =1;\n\n    l = a;\n\n}\n\nWait, so the first element is a. Then, since l was 0, unless a is 0, the else clause will set c to 1. Then l becomes a.\n\nWait, but the first element's c is set to 1 (since after the first iteration, c is either 2 (if a was 0) or 1 (if a wasn't 0). Hmm, perhaps the initial c=1 is a mistake? Or maybe the code is correct.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the first element is 5. Then l was 0, so a != l, so c becomes 1. Then l is set to 5. So the first element's c is 1. That's correct, since it's a single element.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is that for each a, if it's same as previous (l), then increment c, else reset to 1. So the initial l is 0, which is not part of the input. So the first element's check is against 0, which is not part of the sequence. That's a problem. Wait, that's a bug in the original code?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the variables l and c are initialized to 0 and 1 before the loop. Then, in the first iteration, a is the first element. Then, if a == l (0), then c becomes 2. Else, c becomes 1. Then l is set to a. So for the first element, the c is either 2 (if a was 0) or 1 (if a wasn't 0). But the first element's count should be 1, so this is incorrect.\n\nAh, so the code has a bug here. Because the initial l is 0, which is not part of the input. So the first element's check is against 0, which is wrong. The correct approach would be to set l to the first element before starting the loop, and then start the loop from the second element. Or perhaps the code is correct as written?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct. Let me see an example.\n\nSuppose the input is n=1, k=0, and the single a is 5. Then:\n\nAfter first iteration:\n\na is 5. Since l was 0, so 5 !=0 \u2192 c becomes 1. Then l is set to 5. So c is 1. Then, after the loop, check if 1 +0 >1 \u2192 1>1? No. So output -1. Which is correct, because the maximum consecutive is 1, and adding k=0 gives 1, which is not exceeding n=1. So the output is -1. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, a sequence 2,2,2. Then:\n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\na=2. l was 0 \u2192 not equal. So c becomes 1. l=2.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\na=2. l is 2 \u2192 equal. c becomes 2. l=2.\n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\na=2 \u2192 equal to l. c becomes 3. l=2.\n\nAfter loop, c=3. Then check if 3 +k >3 \u2192 if k is 0, then 3>3? No \u2192 output -1. But the correct answer here would be: since the maximum consecutive is 3, adding k=0 gives 3, which is equal to n. So output is -1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, a sequence 2,2,3. Then:\n\nAfter first iteration (a=2): c=1, l=2.\n\nSecond iteration (a=2): c becomes 2, l=2.\n\nThird iteration (a=3): not equal \u2192 c=1, l=3.\n\nFinal c is 1. So if k=2, then 1+2=3>3? No. So output -1. But the maximum consecutive is 2 (the first two 2s). So the code's logic is correct here?\n\nWait, the code's final condition is if (c +k >n). The c here is the last run's length. So in the example where the last run is 1, but the previous run was 2, then the maximum run length is 2. The code's logic is only considering the last run's length. That's a problem. Because the code's logic is flawed. Because it only tracks the current run, but the maximum run could have been earlier.\n\nAh, so the code is incorrect. But since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is, even if it's wrong. Because the problem says to translate the sequence as given.\n\nSo the code's logic is that it only considers the last run's length. So the code may have a bug, but I have to replicate it exactly.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to replicate the same logic.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nRead n, k, then the list of a's.\n\nInitialize l =0, c=1.\n\nThen loop over each a in the list:\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++) \u2192 so for all elements. So in Fortran, read the array as an array of integers, say arr(1:n).\n\nThen:\n\nl =0\n\nc =1\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    a = arr(i)\n\n    if (a == l) then\n\n        c = c +1\n\n    else\n\n        c =1\n\n    end if\n\n    l = a\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first iteration (i=1), a is the first element. So comparing to l=0. So same as Java.\n\nAfter processing all elements, check if c +k >n \u2192 if yes, output n -c, else -1.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part (Java File2):\n\nThe second program takes a string x, and processes it in two ways.\n\nFirst, processing from left to right:\n\nCreate a copy of x (a), then for each position from 1 to length-1 (assuming 0-based?), but in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i <x.length(); i++) \u2192 so starting at index 1 (second character) up to the end.\n\nWait, in Java, strings are 0-based. So for a string of length L, indices 0 to L-1.\n\nThe loop starts at i=1 (second character), and compares to previous (i-1). So for each i from 1 to L-1:\n\nif a's current char is same as previous, then flip it (to 0 or 1), and count a1.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)), then flip the current character (i) to the opposite (if it was '1', set to '0', else '1'), and increment a1.\n\nWait, the code is modifying the current character (i) to break the duplicate. So the first approach is to process left to right, changing the current character when duplicates are found.\n\nThe second approach is processing from the end backwards. For each i from L-1 down to 1 (since i>0), check if current and previous are same. If so, flip the previous character (i-1) to break the duplicate, and count a2.\n\nThen output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nIn Fortran, the string can be handled as a character array. Let's see:\n\nThe input to the second part is the result1 (from first part), which is a number. So we need to convert that number to a string. For example, if result1 is 5, then the string is \"5\".\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing result1, we can write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_x\n\nwrite(str_x, '(i0)') result1\n\nThen, process this string.\n\nProcessing the first approach (a1):\n\nInitialize a as the string. Then loop from i=2 to len_trim(str_x) (since in Fortran, strings are 1-based). Wait, in Fortran, the indices are 1-based. So for a string of length L, indices 1 to L.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop starts at i=1 (Java's 0-based is 1, which is Fortran's 2?), no. Wait, let me think:\n\nJava's loop is for (int i=1; i <x.length(); i++), so in Java, i starts at 1 (second character, index 1 in 0-based), and goes up to x.length()-1 (the last index).\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be starting at i=2 (since Fortran is 1-based) up to len_trim(str_x).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"5\", length 1. Then the loop in Java would not run (since i starts at 1, which is less than 1? No, x.length() is 1, so i <1 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So in Fortran, if the string length is 1, the loops for a1 and a2 would not run, so a1 and a2 remain 0, so the min is 0.\n\nSo for the first approach (a1):\n\nInitialize a as the string. Then:\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i =2, len_trim(str_x)\n\n    if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n            a(i:i) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            a(i:i) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be modified as arrays. So we can use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and substring notation.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are stored as arrays of characters. So perhaps using a character array is better.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and process each character.\n\nWait, let's think of the string as a character array. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_str = str_x\n\ninteger :: a1 =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: a_str = x_str\n\ndo i =2, len_trim(a_str)\n\n    if (a_str(i) == a_str(i-1)) then\n\n        if (a_str(i) == '1') then\n\n            a_str(i) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            a_str(i) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the second approach (a2):\n\nWe need to process from the end backwards. The Java code loops from i = x.length()-1 downto 1 (since in Java, i starts at x.length()-1 and goes down to 1 (since i>0)).\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from i = len_trim(b_str) down to 2 (since in Fortran, the indices start at 1, so the last index is len_trim(b_str)).\n\nWait, the Java code's second loop is for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--):\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo i = len_trim(b_str), 2, -1\n\n    if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n\n        if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, in the Java code, when processing from the right, they check if current and previous are same, then flip the previous (i-1) to break the duplicate. So in Fortran, for each i from the end down to 2 (since i must be >0, so i starts at len_trim, then down to 2):\n\nSo the code for a2 would be:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: b_str = x_str\n\ninteger :: a2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(b_str), 2, -1\n\n    if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n\n        if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the result2 is min(a1, a2).\n\nSo after processing, result2 is the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nThird part (Java File3):\n\nThe third program takes a long x, and processes its digits. For each digit, it checks if 9 - r is less than r. If so, and if it's the last digit (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0?), then keep r, else use 9 -r. Else, use r.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nlong x = sc.nextLong();\n\nList<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();\n\nwhile (x>0) {\n\n    long r = x%10;\n\n    if (9 - r < r) {\n\n        if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n        else list.add(9 - r);\n\n    } else {\n\n        list.add(r);\n\n    }\n\n    x = x/10;\n\n}\n\nThen, the list is built in reverse order (since we take mod 10 each time, so digits are added in reverse order). Then, the newNumber is constructed by multiplying each digit by 10^power, starting from the first element (which is the least significant digit of the original number, but becomes the most significant in the new number? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe list is built by taking the last digit first (since x starts as the original number, and mod 10 gives the last digit, then x is divided by 10. So the list is [r1, r2, ..., rn], where r1 is the last digit of the original number, r2 the second last, etc. So when reconstructing newNumber, the first element (r1) is the least significant digit of the original, but in the new number, it's the most significant digit? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code loops while x>0, so for example, x=123:\n\nFirst iteration: r=3 \u2192 added to list. x becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: r=2 \u2192 added. x becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration: r=1 \u2192 added. x becomes 0 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nList is [3,2,1].\n\nThen, newNumber is built as:\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nFirst element (3): newNumber = 0 +3 *10^0 \u2192 3.\n\nSecond element (2): newNumber =3 +2*10^1 \u2192 23.\n\nThird element (1): 23 +1*10^2 \u2192 123. So the new number is 123, which is the same as original. Wait, but that's not the case. Wait, the code's logic is to process each digit and then build the new number in reverse order. Wait, the code's loop for building newNumber is:\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nfor i from 0 to list.size-1:\n\n    newNumber += list.get(i) * 10^pow\n\n    pow +=1\n\nSo for the list [3,2,1], the newNumber is 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 \u2192 123. So the new number is the same as the original. But the code's purpose is to modify each digit to the closest to 9. Let me see the condition:\n\nThe code checks if 9 - r < r. So for a digit r, if 9 - r is smaller than r, then choose 9 - r, else keep r. Except when it's the last digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 -r is zero (i.e., r=9?), then keep r.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then:\n\n    if (x/10 ==0 (meaning it's the last digit) and (9 - r ==0 \u2192 which would mean r=9)) \u2192 then add r (so 9 stays as 9?), else add 9 -r.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose r is 5. 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 so choose 4. So the digit becomes 4.\n\nIf r is 4, 9-4=5 which is not less than 4 \u2192 so keep 4.\n\nWait, the condition is 9 - r < r \u2192 which is equivalent to r>4.5 \u2192 so for digits 5-9, 9-r is smaller, so we choose 9-r. For 0-4, keep r.\n\nWait, but the exception is when it's the last digit (x/10 ==0 \u2192 meaning that after division by 10, x becomes 0 \u2192 so the current r is the first digit (the original's last digit?), and if 9 -r is zero (i.e., r=9), then we add r (so 9 stays as 9). Otherwise, add 9 -r.\n\nWait, the code's condition for the exception is:\n\nif (x/10 ==0) \u2192 meaning that after this iteration, x will be 0 (since x is divided by 10). So the current r is the last digit of the original number. So in that case, if 9 - r ==0 (i.e., r=9), then we add r (so 9 stays as 9). Otherwise, add 9 -r.\n\nWait, but why? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 9. Then, in the loop:\n\nr =9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 so check if x/10 (which is 0) ==0 \u2192 yes. And 9 -r is 0 \u2192 so add r (9). So the digit remains 9.\n\nIf the number is 8, then r=8. 9-8=1 <8 \u2192 so check if it's the last digit (yes). 9-8=1 \u22600 \u2192 so add 1. So the new digit is 1. So the new number would be 1, but the original was 8. The distance from 8 to 9 is 1, which is better than 8 to 0 (distance 8). So the code is correct here.\n\nWait, but the code's exception is only when the digit is the last digit (the original's last digit) and 9 -r is zero (i.e., r=9). Then, it keeps the digit as 9. Otherwise, it uses 9 -r.\n\nSo the code is trying to choose the digit closest to 9, but for the last digit, if the digit is 9, it stays as 9 (since 9 is already closest to itself). Otherwise, it uses 9 -r. Wait, but 9 -r would be the distance from 9. For example, if the digit is 8, then 9-8=1, which is the distance. So the code is choosing the digit that is the closest to 9, but for the last digit, if the digit is 9, it stays, else uses 9 -r. Wait, but 9 -r is the distance, but the actual digit would be 9 -r? That would be the digit that is the mirror around 4.5. For example, 5 becomes 4 (since 9-5=4), which is closer to 9 (distance 4) than 5 (distance 4). Wait, same distance. Hmm, maybe the code is trying to minimize the sum of distances? Not sure, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must replicate this logic.\n\nSo, the third part's input is result2 (the number from the second part). So in Fortran:\n\nresult2 is an integer (from the second part's output). We need to process it as a long (but in Fortran, integers can be handled as integers).\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead the number (result2), then process each digit.\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold the modified digits.\n\nLoop while the number is >0:\n\n    r = mod(x,10)\n\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n\n        if ( (x/10 ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n            add r to the list\n\n        else\n\n            add (9 - r) to the list\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        add r to the list\n\n    end if\n\n    x = x /10\n\nThen, the list is built in reverse order (digits from least to most significant of original). Then, construct the new number by reversing the list and multiplying by powers of 10.\n\nWait, the list is built as [r1, r2, ..., rn], where r1 is the last digit of the original number. To form the new number, we need to take the first element as the first digit (most significant) of the new number? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn the code's example with 123, the list is [3,2,1], and the new number is 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 \u2192 123. So the digits are arranged in the same order as the original's digits reversed. Wait, no, the new number is the same as the original. Because each digit was kept as is (since for 3, 9-3=6 which is not less than 3 (since 6>3 \u2192 so else clause, so 3 is added. Similarly for 2 and 1. So the code's logic for digits 0-4 is to keep them, and for 5-9, replace with 9-r. So in this case, the digits are 3,2,1 (all \u22644?), no, 3 is 3, which is less than 4.5, so kept. So the new number is same as original.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, for digits 5-9, it uses 9 -r. So for example, if the digit is 5, it becomes 4. So the code is trying to make each digit as close to 9 as possible, but for digits above 4.5, it uses 9 -r, which is smaller. Wait, 9-5=4, which is closer to 9 than 5? No, 5 is 4 away from 9, 4 is 5 away. Wait, no, 9-5 is 4, so the distance from 5 to 9 is 4, and from 4 to 9 is 5. So that's worse. Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe the code is actually trying to minimize the sum of the digits? Or perhaps the code has a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to choose the digit that is closest to 9. For a digit r, the distance to 9 is 9 - r. The distance to 0 is r. So if 9 - r < r \u2192 then 9 is closer, so choose 9 - r? Wait, no. Wait, the distance to 9 is (9 - r), but the digit can't be 9 - r. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to choose between r and 9 - r, whichever is closer to 9. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to choose the digit that is closest to 4.5, but I'm not sure. The code's logic is as written, so I have to follow it.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each digit r:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then choose 9 - r, except when it's the last digit and 9 -r is zero (then keep r).\n\nElse, keep r.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the input (result2) as an integer (x).\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold the digits. Since in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, perhaps we can use a dynamic array or just a list. Alternatively, since the maximum possible input is up to 1e18 (since it's a long), but in Fortran, we can use an array of size, say, 20.\n\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits\n\ninteger :: idx =0\n\nx = result2\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n    r = mod(x,10)\n\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n\n        if ( (x/10 ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n            digit = r\n\n        else\n\n            digit = 9 - r\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        digit = r\n\n    end if\n\n    idx = idx +1\n\n    digits(idx) = digit\n\n    x = x /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, the digits array has the modified digits in reverse order (from least to most significant of original). To form the new number, we need to reverse them and compute the value.\n\nThe new number is computed as:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ndo i =1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber *10 + digits(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Because the digits are stored in the order of the least significant digit first. For example, original 123 \u2192 digits are [3,2,1]. To form the new number, the first digit (3) is the first digit of the new number? No, the new number would be 321? Wait, no. Wait, in the code's example, the new number is 123. Because the digits are added as 3,2,1, and then multiplied by 10^0, 10^1, 10^2 \u2192 3 +20 +100 \u2192 123. So the digits are in the order of the original's digits reversed, but when building the new number, each digit is multiplied by 10^(i-1). So the first digit (3) is the units place, second (2) tens, third (1) hundreds. So the new number is 123. So the digits array is [3,2,1], and the new number is built as 3*10^0 +2*10^1 +1*10^2 \u2192 123.\n\nWait, so the digits array is in the order of the original's digits reversed. To form the new number, each digit is placed in the correct position by multiplying by 10^(power). So the code's approach is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, the same can be done by:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ndo i =1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber *10 + digits(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting with newNumber=0.\n\nFirst iteration (i=1, digit=3):\n\nnewNumber =0 *10 +3 \u21923.\n\nSecond (digit=2): 3*10 +2 \u219232.\n\nThird (digit=1): 32*10 +1 \u2192321. Which is different from the code's result. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the code's approach in Java is:\n\nnewNumber starts at 0.\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nfor each digit in the list (3,2,1):\n\nnewNumber += digit * 10^pow \u2192 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 \u2192 123.\n\nBut in the Fortran code above, the loop is adding digits multiplied by 10^(i-1) (since each step multiplies by 10 and adds the digit). So the code's approach would give 321, which is different.\n\nAh, so the Fortran code's approach is incorrect. Need to fix that.\n\nWait, the correct way is to process the digits in the order they were stored (from least to most significant of original), and each digit is placed in the correct position. So the first digit (3) is the units place (10^0), second (2) is tens (10^1), third (1) is hundreds (10^2). So the total is 3 + 20 + 100 = 123.\n\nThe code in Java does this by multiplying by 10^pow, where pow starts at 0 and increments each step. So in Fortran, the same can be done by:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\npow =0\n\ndo i =1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, using the same approach as the code.\n\nAlternatively, the code's way is to multiply by 10 each time and add the digit. Wait, no, that would be:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\nfor each digit in the list (3,2,1):\n\nnewNumber = newNumber *10 + digit \u2192 0*10+3=3 \u2192 3*10+2=32 \u2192 32*10+1=321. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the correct way is to use the power of 10.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we need to track the power.\n\nInitialize newNumber =0, pow=0.\n\ndo i=1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, compute 10^pow each time.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the powers.\n\nAlternatively, use 10**pow as an integer exponent.\n\nIn Fortran, 10**pow can be calculated as 10^pow.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ninteger :: newNumber =0, pow=0\n\ndo i=1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nThis way, for the example, it would compute 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 \u2192123.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, k, then n integers).\n\n2. Compute result1 (the first program's output).\n\n3. Convert result1 to a string (str_x).\n\n4. Process the second program's logic on str_x to get result2 (the minimum of a1 and a2).\n\n5. Convert result2 to an integer (since it's the output of the second program, which is a number).\n\n6. Process the third program's logic on result2 to get the final result3.\n\n7. Output result3.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n, k, and the array of a's.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, k, result1, result2, result3\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\ninteger :: i, l, c, a\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_x\n\ninteger :: a1, a2\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: a_str, b_str\n\ninteger :: x_third, newNumber, idx, pow\n\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits\n\nNow, step by step.\n\nRead the first part's input:\n\nRead *, n, k\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n    read *, arr(i)\n\nend do\n\nProcess first part:\n\nl =0\n\nc =1\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n    a = arr(i)\n\n    if (a == l) then\n\n        c = c +1\n\n    else\n\n        c =1\n\n    end if\n\n    l = a\n\nend do\n\nif (c +k >n) then\n\n    result1 = n -c\n\nelse\n\n    result1 = -1\n\nend if\n\nConvert result1 to string:\n\nwrite(str_x, '(i0)') result1\n\nProcess second part:\n\nx_str = str_x\n\na_str = x_str\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i=2, len_trim(a_str)\n\n    if (a_str(i:i) == a_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        if (a_str(i:i) == '1') then\n\n            a_str(i:i) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            a_str(i:i) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nb_str = x_str\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(b_str), 2, -1\n\n    if (b_str(i:i) == b_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        if (b_str(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n            b_str(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            b_str(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nresult2 = min(a1, a2)\n\nProcess third part:\n\nx_third = result2\n\nidx =0\n\ndo while (x_third >0)\n\n    r = mod(x_third,10)\n\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n\n        if ( (x_third/10 ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n            digit = r\n\n        else\n\n            digit = 9 - r\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        digit = r\n\n    end if\n\n    idx = idx +1\n\n    digits(idx) = digit\n\n    x_third = x_third /10\n\nend do\n\nnewNumber =0\n\npow =0\n\ndo i=1, idx\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nresult3 = newNumber\n\nFinally, output result3.\n\nprint *, result3\n\nWait, but need to make sure all variables are properly declared and the code is structured correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nBut also, need to handle the case where the string is empty? Probably not, since the first program's output is either a number (could be -1, which is \"-1\" as a string).\n\nWait, if result1 is -1, then the string is \"-1\". The second program processes that string. The code for the second part should handle that.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose first program outputs -1 \u2192 the second program's input is \"-1\".\n\nProcessing that string:\n\nThe characters are '-', '1'.\n\nThe first loop (a1):\n\ni starts at 2 (since len_trim is 2).\n\nCheck if a_str(2) == a_str(1). The first character is '-', second is '1'. They are different, so no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nThe second loop (a2):\n\nProcessing from the end (i=2 down to 2 (since len_trim is 2):\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck if b_str(2) and b_str(1) are same \u2192 no. So no change. a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, result2 is 0.\n\nThen third part processes 0 \u2192 the digits are 0 \u2192 the new number is 0.\n\nSo the final output would be 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program outputs 5 \u2192 string \"5\".\n\nSecond part processes it:\n\na_str is \"5\", length 1 \u2192 loops don't run. a1=0.\n\nb_str same \u2192 a2=0. result2=0.\n\nThird part processes 0 \u2192 digits is [0]. newNumber is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs 123 \u2192 string \"123\".\n\nSecond part:\n\nProcessing a_str:\n\ni=2 (char '2') and i-1 (char '1') \u2192 different \u2192 no change. i=3 (char '3') vs '2' \u2192 different. So a1 remains 0.\n\nProcessing b_str from the end:\n\ni=3 (char '3') and i-1 (2) \u2192 different. i=2 (char '2') and 1 \u2192 different. So a2 remains 0. result2=0.\n\nThird part processes 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nHmm, but maybe another example where the second part's processing is needed.\n\nSuppose first program outputs \"11\" \u2192 string \"11\".\n\nSecond part:\n\na_str is \"11\".\n\nProcessing a1:\n\ni=2: a_str(2) is '1', same as previous '1'. So flip to '0', a1 becomes 1.\n\nSo a_str becomes \"10\".\n\na1 is 1.\n\nProcessing a2:\n\nb_str is \"11\".\n\nLoop from i=2 down to 2:\n\ni=2: check if b_str(2) and 1 are same \u2192 yes. So flip the previous (i-1=1) to '0'. So b_str becomes \"01\". a2 becomes 1.\n\nThus, min(1,1) \u21921. result2=1.\n\nThird part processes 1 \u2192 digits is [1].\n\nProcessing:\n\nr=1. 9-1=8 <1? 8 is not less than 1 \u2192 so else clause. So digit is 1.\n\nnewNumber is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the code would output 1.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut need to make sure that the variables are properly declared and the loops are correct.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, character strings can be handled with substrings.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, k, result1, result2, result3\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n    integer :: i, l, c, a\n    character(len=20) :: str_x\n    integer :: a1, a2\n    character(len=20) :: a_str, b_str\n    integer :: x_third, newNumber, idx, pow\n    integer, dimension(20) :: digits\n\n    !
