    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_629_A) reads an integer num, then num strings. It calculates a fine based on counting 'C's in each column and row, then sums combinations. The output is the fine value. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string, processes it with a DP approach modulo 1e9+7, and outputs a count mod that. The third (codeforces_514_A) takes a number, processes its digits, and outputs a transformed number.\n\nThe key is to chain them: the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in the middle. So the first program's output (fine) becomes the input to the second, which processes it as a string (since the second Java program reads a string). Wait, but the first's output is an integer. So the second program expects a string input, which would be the fine's string representation. Then the second's output is a number (the DP result), which is the input to the third program, which expects a long.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (num and the strings).\n2. Compute the fine (first program's result).\n3. Use that fine as the input to the second program (so convert it to a string, then process it as per the second Java's logic).\n4. Take the output of the second program (a number mod 1e9+7) and use it as the input to the third program (so convert to a long).\n5. Output the third program's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran:\n\nFirst part (codeforces_629_A):\n\n- Read num, then num strings. Each string is stored in an array.\n- For each column (i from 0 to num-1), count the 'C's in each row's i-th character. Then compute combinations (n choose 2) and add to fine. Then do the same for rows (each row's characters, count 'C's, add combinations).\n- The result is the total fine.\n\nSecond part (atcoder_ABC135_D):\n\n- The input is the string representation of the fine from first part. So in Fortran, after computing the fine, we need to convert it to a string, then process it as per the DP logic.\n\nThe DP uses a 2D array (dp[i][pre]), with mod 1e9+7. The base is 10^i mod 13, but in reverse order (since the string is processed from the end). The final answer is dp[last][5].\n\nThird part (codeforces_514_A):\n\n- Take the number from the second's output (the DP result), process each digit, choosing the minimal between digit and 9-digit (except when leading zero?), then form the new number.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\n- num is an integer. The strings are an array of strings. In Fortran, strings can be stored in a character array. Let's say max length per string is, say, 100 (since Java's code uses next(), but maybe the problem constraints are known? Well, assuming each string is up to some length, but perhaps in the problem, the input is such that each string is of length num? Wait, looking at the first Java code:\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the first loop reads num strings, each presumably of length num? Because in the loops for columns and rows, the code loops over i from 0 to num-1 (columns) and for each row k, arr.get(k).charAt(i). So each string must be of length at least num? Or maybe the problem's input ensures that each string is exactly length num. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read each string as a character array of length num.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead num, then read num strings, each of length num.\n\nThen, for each column (i from 1 to num), count the number of 'C's in each row's i-th character (Fortran is 1-based). Then compute combinations and add to fine. Then do the same for rows (each row's characters, count 'C's in each row's characters, then add combinations).\n\nWait, in Java, the code loops over columns first (the first for loop for columns, then rows for each column's characters). Let me recheck:\n\nFirst loop for columns:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < num; i++) { // columns\n    for (int k = 0; k < num; k++) { // rows\n        if (arr.get(k).charAt(i) == 'C') counter++;\n    }\n    fine += (counter*(counter-1))/2\n    counter =0\n}\n\nThen for rows:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < num; i++) { // rows\n    for (int k=0; k < num; k++) { // columns\n        if (arr.get(i).charAt(k) == 'C') counter++;\n    }\n    fine += ... etc.\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part would be:\n\nRead num, then read num strings (each of length num). Let's say stored in a 2D array, say, arr(1:num, 1:num) as characters.\n\nThen, for columns (i from 1 to num):\n\ncounter =0\ndo k =1, num\n   if (arr(k,i) == 'C') counter = counter +1\nend do\nfine = fine + counter*(counter-1)/2\ncounter =0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the rows and columns might be arranged differently. Need to make sure the indices are correct.\n\nThen for rows:\n\ndo i=1, num\n   counter =0\n   do k=1, num\n      if (arr(i,k) == 'C') counter = counter +1\n   end do\n   fine = fine + counter*(counter-1)/2\nend do\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part: the input is the fine from first part, which is an integer. So we need to convert that integer to a string, then process it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program takes a string (like \"1234?5?\") and computes a DP. The input here is the string representation of the first's output (the fine). So in Fortran, after computing the fine, we need to convert it to a string. Let's say the fine is stored as an integer variable, then we can write something like:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(i0)') fine\ns = adjustl(s)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, the length of s is len_trim(s). The DP array in the second Java program is a 2D array of size [cs.length][13]. In Fortran, we can use a 2D array, say dp(0: len-1, 0:12), since Java uses 0-based indices. Wait, in the Java code, the dp is initialized as new long[cs.length][13], so the first dimension is from 0 to cs.length-1. So in Fortran, perhaps we can have dp(0: len-1, 0:12).\n\nThe base starts at 1, and for each character (processed from the end), the code loops over the digits. The Java code processes the characters in reverse order (cs.length -1 -i). Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i =0; i < cs.length; i++) and the current character is cs[cs.length-1 -i]. So the first iteration (i=0) takes the last character, then i=1 takes the second last, etc. So the processing is from the end of the string to the start.\n\nIn Fortran, the string s is stored as a character array. Let's say s has length len = len_trim(s). The characters are s(1), s(2), ..., s(len). So for the loop in the second part, the first character to process is s(len), then s(len-1), etc. So in the loop over i from 0 to len-1 (since the Java code's loop is for i from 0 to cs.length-1), each step corresponds to the i-th step in the Java code, which processes the (len-1 -i)th character in the original string.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i =0; i < cs.length; ++i) and the current character is cs[cs.length -1 -i]. So for i=0, it's the last character (index len-1 in 0-based), then i=1 is len-2, etc. So in Fortran, the first character to process is s(len), then s(len-1), etc. So the loop in Fortran would be similar.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran would be a 2D array of integers (or integers with mod, but in Fortran, perhaps using integers with mod 1e9+7). The MOD is 1e9+7, which is 1000000007. So in Fortran, we can define MOD as 1000000007.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So in Fortran, base is initialized to 1, and after each step, base = (base *10) mod 13.\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each i from 0 to len-1 (Fortran's loop from 0 to len-1):\n\nIf the current character is '?', then for each pre in 0..12, and next in 0..9, we add to dp[i][ (base*next + pre) mod 13 ] the value from dp[i-1][pre], etc.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each pre and next, the next is 0-9 (since it's a digit). So for '?', we loop next from 0 to 9, and for each, compute the new value.\n\nElse, the next is the digit value (cs[...] - '0'), so in Fortran, if the character is '?', then we loop next from 0 to 9, else next is the digit.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when the character is '?', the code loops next from 0 to 9, and for each, adds to the dp. When it's not '?', it uses the digit's value and only that next.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i (from 0 to len-1):\n\ncurrent_char = s(len - i)  (since in Java, the index is cs.length-1 -i, which in Fortran's 1-based is len -i )\n\nWait, let me think again. The Java code's current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). Since in Fortran, the string is 1-based, so the first character is s(1), last is s(len). So for i from 0 to len-1:\n\nJava's position is (len -1 -i) (0-based), which in Fortran is (len -i) (since 0-based to 1-based: add 1). Wait, no:\n\nWait, in Java, the original string's indices are 0-based. So for a string of length len, the indices are 0 to len-1. The code's current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (position len-1 in Java, which is s(len) in Fortran). For i=1, it's position len-2 (Java) which is s(len-1) in Fortran. So in Fortran, the current character is s(len - i).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's index: (cs.length-1 -i) \u2192 for i from 0 to len-1:\n\nAt i=0 \u2192 (len-1 -0) \u2192 len-1 (Java's last character \u2192 Fortran's s(len))\n\nAt i=1 \u2192 (len-1 -1) \u2192 len-2 \u2192 s(len-1)\n\nYes. So in Fortran, the current character is s(len - i).\n\nSo for each i in 0 to len-1:\n\ncurrent_char = s(len - i)\n\nThen, if current_char is '?', then loop next from 0 to 9, else next is the digit value (current_char - '0').\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based by declaring with lower bounds. Let me think:\n\nWe can declare dp as an array of size (0: len-1, 0:12). But in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nBut the length len is variable, so we need to use allocatable arrays. Alternatively, since the maximum possible length of the first program's output is, say, up to 1e9 (if num is 1e5, but probably not, but in any case, the second program's input is the fine from first, which could be up to (n*(n-1)/2)*2n \u2192 but for n up to say 1e5, that's way too big. Wait, but the first program's fine is the sum over columns and rows of combinations. For each column, if there are c Cs, then c*(c-1)/2. For n rows and n columns, the maximum possible is n*(n choose 2)*2 \u2192 but even for n=1e5, that's way too big. Wait, but in the problem's context, perhaps the first program's input is small enough. But in any case, the second program's input is the fine's string, so the length is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a number that can be stored as an integer in Fortran (since in Java it's an int, but in Fortran, integers can be 32-bit, but if the fine is up to (n^3), then for n up to 1e5, that's 1e15, which is beyond 32-bit. Hmm, but in the first Java code, the fine is an int, so it's limited to 2^31-1. So the maximum possible fine is up to that. So the string can be up to 10 digits (since 2^30 is about a billion, so 10 digits). So the length is manageable.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's variables can be handled with allocatable arrays.\n\nNow, the DP steps:\n\nInitialize dp. For each i, the dp[i][...] depends on dp[i-1][...].\n\nInitially, for i=0 (the first character processed), the base is 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, base starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So in Fortran:\n\nbase = 1\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n   current_char = s(len - i)\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n      do pre =0, 12\n         do next =0,9\n             new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod 13\n             if (i ==0) then\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0 ? 1 :0)\n             else\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n             end if\n             dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n         end do\n      end do\n   else\n      next = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n      do pre =0,12\n          new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod 13\n          if (i ==0) then\n              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0)\n          else\n              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n          end if\n          dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n      end do\n   end if\n\n   base = mod(base *10, 13)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the base is updated after each step. The base is initially 1, and after processing each character (i steps), it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So in the code above, after processing the current character (i), the base is updated for the next step.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nbase = base *10 %13;\n\nSo in Fortran, after processing the current i, we do base = mod(base *10, 13).\n\nWait, but in the code above, the base is used in the current step's calculation. Because the next step's base is for the next character. Let me see:\n\nThe current step is i (0-based). The base is used in the calculation for this step. The next step's base is base *10 mod13.\n\nYes, so the code above is correct.\n\nBut in the loops, the initial dp is zero, and for each i, we have to initialize the dp[i][...] before adding.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is initialized to zero each time? Or is it that for each i, the dp[i][...] is being built from dp[i-1][...]?\n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is initialized as new long[...], so all elements are zero. Then, for each i, the code loops over pre and next, and adds to dp[i][new_mod] the value from dp[i-1][pre] (or 1 if i==0 and pre==0).\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i =0; ... ) {\n    for (pre ...) {\n        for (next ...) {\n            dp[i][...] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the initial dp array must be zero, and then for each i, we loop over pre and next, and add the previous value.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are initialized to zero by default when declared, but when using allocatable arrays, we need to set them to zero each time. Alternatively, we can initialize them properly.\n\nWait, in the code above, the loops for pre and next are adding to dp(i, new_mod). So we need to start with dp(i, new_mod) as zero, then add the contributions.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, before processing each i, we need to set dp(i,:) to zero, then accumulate the values.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is initialized to zero, so each dp[i][...] starts at zero, and the loops add to it.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each i, before processing, we need to set dp(i,:) = 0.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are over pre and next, and for each, they add to dp(i, new_mod). So the initial value of dp(i, new_mod) must be zero.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, before the loops for pre and next, we need to set dp(i,:) = 0.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are over pre and next, and for each, they add to dp(i, new_mod). So the initial value of dp(i, new_mod) must be zero. So in Fortran, before processing each i, we need to set dp(i,:) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, the loops are adding to the current value, so we can initialize the dp array to zero before starting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code should be structured as:\n\nInitialize dp as all zeros.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n   current_char = s(len -i)\n\n   if (current_char is '?') then\n      do pre =0,12\n         do next =0,9\n             new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod 13\n             if (i ==0) then\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0 ? 1 :0)\n             else\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n             end if\n             dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n         end do\n      end do\n   else\n      next = ... \n      do pre =0,12\n          new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13\n          if (i ==0) then\n              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0)\n          else\n              dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n          end if\n          dp(i, new_mod) = mod(... )\n      end do\n   end if\n\n   base = mod(base *10, 13)\n\nWait, but in this case, the dp array must be initialized to zero before each i step. Because otherwise, the previous values would carry over.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, the dp[i][...] is being computed from dp[i-1][...], so the previous values (from i-1) are stored in dp[i-1], and the current dp[i] is being built from scratch. So for each i, the dp[i] array must be initialized to zero before processing.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, before processing each i, we need to set dp(i,:) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, in the code above, the loops are adding to dp(i, new_mod), so if we start with zero, that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the loops are adding to dp(i, new_mod). So for each new_mod, the initial value is zero, and then each iteration adds the contribution. So yes, the initial value must be zero.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, before processing each i, we need to set dp(i,:) = 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i =0, len-1\n   dp(i, :) = 0\n   current_char = s(len -i)\n   ... process ...\nend do\n\nAlternatively, we can initialize the entire dp array to zero before starting, but then for each i, we overwrite it.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to initialize the entire dp array to zero first.\n\nBut in any case, the code must ensure that each dp[i][...] starts at zero before adding the contributions.\n\nNow, the third part (codeforces_514_A):\n\nThe input is the output of the second program, which is a number mod 1e9+7. So the number is stored as an integer (let's say mod_result). We need to process its digits.\n\nThe third Java program takes a long x, and for each digit (from least significant to most), it chooses the minimal between the digit and 9-digit (except when it's the last digit and 9-digit is zero, then it keeps the digit). Then constructs the new number.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nlong x = sc.nextLong();\nList<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (x >0) {\n    long r = x%10;\n    if (9 - r < r) {\n        if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n        else list.add(9 - r);\n    } else list.add(r);\n    x = x/10;\n}\nThen, the list is reversed (since the digits are collected from least to most, but stored in reverse order?), then multiplied by 10^power.\n\nWait, in the code, the digits are collected in reverse order. For example, x=123:\n\nx starts as 123 \u2192 r=3 \u2192 added to list. x becomes 12.\n\nThen r=2 \u2192 added. x becomes 1.\n\nr=1 \u2192 added. x becomes 0.\n\nSo list is [3,2,1]. Then, when building newNumber, the first element (3) is multiplied by 10^0, then 2 by 10^1, etc. So the newNumber is 3*1 + 2*10 +1*100 \u2192 123. But the code's processing is to choose between r and 9-r.\n\nWait, the code's condition is if (9 - r < r) \u2192 then choose 9-r, else r. Except when it's the last digit (x/10 ==0) and 9-r is zero (i.e., r=9), then keep r (since 9-9=0, but if it's the last digit, then adding 0 would make it zero, but the problem might not allow leading zeros? Or perhaps the problem requires that the number is as small as possible, but not leading zeros. Wait, the problem's description for codeforces_514_A is to find the minimal number of button presses to reach the number, where each digit can be pressed up or down, so the minimal steps is min(r, 9-r). But the problem requires the number to be as small as possible in terms of digit value, but not leading zeros. Wait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 choose 9-r, else r. But when the digit is the last (i.e., x/10 ==0, meaning it's the first digit in the original number's most significant digit?), then if 9 - r is zero (i.e., r=9), then we can't choose 0 because that would make the number have leading zero. So in that case, we keep r (9).\n\nWait, the code's condition:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 (i.e., it's the last digit) and (9 - r ==0 \u2192 which is when r=9), then add r (9) instead of 0.\n\nElse, add 9 - r.\n\nElse, add r.\n\nSo the code is handling leading zeros by not allowing them when it's the last digit (the first digit of the original number).\n\nSo in Fortran, the third part's processing is:\n\nTake the mod_result (the output of the second program), which is a number. Let's say stored as an integer (since it's mod 1e9+7, which is up to ~1e9, so 32-bit integer can hold it).\n\nThen, process each digit:\n\nInitialize a list (array) to store the digits.\n\nWhile mod_result >0:\n\n   r = mod(mod_result,10)\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n      if (mod_result /10 ==0 .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n          digit = r\n\n      else\n\n          digit = 9 - r\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   add digit to the list.\n\n   mod_result = mod_result /10\n\nThen, the list is in reverse order (LSB first). So when building the new number, the first element is the least significant digit. So the new number is constructed as:\n\nnewNumber = 0\n\npow =0\n\ndo i=1, size(list)\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + list(i) * 10**pow\n\n   pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. However, for large numbers, this might overflow. But since the maximum possible mod_result is 1e9, the digits are up to 9 digits, so 10^8 is manageable as an integer (since 1e9 is 10^9, but 10^8 is 100 million, which is within 32-bit integer).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be 32 or 64 bits. Assuming 32-bit, the maximum is 2^31-1 (~2e9). So 1e9 is okay, but 10^8 is 100 million, so 10^8 *9 (for a digit) is 9e8, which is okay. So the newNumber can be stored as an integer.\n\nWait, but the code's example:\n\nSuppose mod_result is 5, then the newNumber is 5 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: mod_result is 9 \u2192 the code would process:\n\nr=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. But since mod_result/10 is 0 (since 9/10 is 0), and 9-r is 0 \u2192 so the condition is met. So the digit is r (9). So the newNumber is 9.\n\nAnother example: mod_result is 19 \u2192 digits 9 and 1.\n\nProcessing 19 \u2192 first r=9 (mod 10). mod_result/10 is 1 (since 19/10 is 1). So the condition (mod_result/10 ==0) is false, so digit is 0 (9-9=0). So the first digit (LSB) is 0. Then mod_result becomes 1.\n\nNext r=1 \u2192 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 so digit is 1. So the digits are [0,1]. The newNumber is 1*10 +0 \u2192 10.\n\nWait, but the original number is 19. The minimal steps would be for each digit:\n\n1: min(1,8) \u2192 1.\n\n9: min(9,0) \u2192 0. So the new number is 10, which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nIn Fortran, the list can be an array of integers. Let's say we have an array digits of size, say, 10 (since mod_result is up to 1e9, so 10 digits max).\n\nSo steps for third part:\n\nRead the mod_result (from second part's output).\n\nInitialize an array digits, and a counter.\n\nThen loop while mod_result >0:\n\n   r = mod(mod_result,10)\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n      if (mod_result /10 ==0 .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n          digit = r\n\n      else\n\n          digit = 9 - r\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   digits(counter) = digit\n\n   counter = counter +1\n\n   mod_result = mod_result /10\n\nThen, the digits are stored in reverse order (LSB first). So when building newNumber:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ndo i=1, counter\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**(i-1)\n\nend do\n\nWait, because the first digit (digits(1)) is the least significant (units place), so multiplied by 10^0, the second by 10^1, etc. So the exponent is (i-1).\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nNow, the first part's input is:\n\nFirst line: integer num.\n\nThen num lines, each a string of length num.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the code uses sc.next() for each string. So each string is read as a single token (so no spaces). So in Fortran, we can read each string as a single line, but perhaps using a read statement with a format that reads the entire line.\n\nAlternatively, read each string as a character array of length num.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the first input:\n\nRead *, num\n\nThen, read num strings, each of length num.\n\nWe can use a character array arr(1:num, 1:num).\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to num:\n\n   read *, arr(i, 1:num)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading a string into a character array can be done with a format like '(A)'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=num) :: temp\n\ndo i=1, num\n\n   read(*, '(A)') temp\n\n   arr(i, 1:num) = temp(1:num)\n\nend do\n\nBut need to ensure that each string is exactly length num. So the input must be such that each string is exactly num characters.\n\nAssuming that, then the first part's processing can proceed.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read the first part's input (num and the strings).\n\n- Compute the fine (first part's result).\n\n- Convert fine to a string s.\n\n- Process s through the second part's DP to get mod_result.\n\n- Process mod_result through the third part to get newNumber.\n\n- Output newNumber.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: num, i, j, counter, fine, MOD = 1000000007\n   character(len=100) :: s\n   character(len=100), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: arr\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n   integer :: len, base, mod_result, newNumber, counter_digits, digit\n   integer, dimension(10) :: digits\n\n   !

So when allocating, it's okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you allocate an array with allocate(dp(0:len-1, 0:12)), that's allowed if the lower bounds are set correctly.\n\nAlso, in the current_char assignment: s(len -i : len -i) \u2192 since s is a character string, s(len-i) is the correct character.\n\nAnother point: in the second part's loops, when current_char is '?', the next loops from 0 to9. But in Fortran, the loop variables must be integers. So next is an integer variable.\n\nWait, in the code above, the loops are:\n\ndo next=0,9\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable must be declared. Wait, no, in Fortran, the loop variable is an integer, but in the code above, the variables pre and next are not declared. That's an error.\n\nAh, right! I need to declare all variables. So in the second part's loops:\n\nInside the i loop:\n\ninteger :: pre, next, new_mod, next_val\n\nWait, but in the code above, variables like pre and next are used without declaration. That's a mistake.\n\nSo need to add declarations for all variables.\n\nLet me rework the second part's code with proper declarations.\n\nAlso, in the third part, the digits array is declared as dimension(10), but if mod_result is up to 1e9, then 9 digits, so 10 is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part's loop, when mod_result is 0, the loop exits. But if mod_result was 0, then the digits array is empty, but then the newNumber would be 0, which is correct.\n\nNow, correcting the code:\n\nIn the second part's loop over i:\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n   dp(i,:) =0\n\n   character(len=1) :: current_char\n   current_char = s(len -i : len -i)\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n      do pre=0,12\n         do next=0,9\n            integer :: new_mod = mod(base * next + pre, 13)\n            if (i ==0) then\n               dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0)\n            else\n               dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n            end if\n            dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n         end do\n      end do\n   else\n      integer :: next_val = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n      do pre=0,12\n         integer :: new_mod = mod(base * next_val + pre, 13)\n         if (i ==0) then\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0)\n         else\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n         end if\n         dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n      end do\n   end if\n   base = mod(base *10, 13)\nend do\n\nWait, but variables pre and next are loop variables and need to be declared. In Fortran, the loop variables are integers, but they must be declared in the scope.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variables are local to the loop. So in the loops:\n\ndo pre=0,12\n\n   do next=0,9\n\n      ... \n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThe variables pre and next are automatically declared as integers. So that's okay.\n\nBut in the else clause, next_val is used. So need to declare next_val as an integer.\n\nWait, in the else clause:\n\ninteger :: next_val = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\nYes, that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's code, the columns and rows loops.\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nFor columns (j from 1 to num):\n\n   counter counts the number of 'C's in column j (i.e., for each row i, arr(i,j) is checked).\n\nThen, for rows (i from 1 to num):\n\n   counter counts the number of 'C's in row i (j from 1 to num).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: in the first part's code, the fine is computed as the sum of combinations for each column and row. The code in Fortran should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for possible errors:\n\n- The first part's fine is computed correctly.\n\n- The second part's DP is correctly implemented.\n\n- The third part's digit processing is correct.\n\nNow, the code may have some syntax issues. For example, in Fortran, the assignment to dp(i, new_mod) must be done with the correct indices.\n\nAlso, in the second part's code, the initial dp array is allocated and set to zero. The loops then process each i, setting dp(i,:) to zero first, then adding the contributions.\n\nWait, in the code above, before the loops for pre and next, the code does dp(i,:) =0. But then, in the loops, it adds to dp(i, new_mod). So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's code, the current_char is taken as s(len -i : len -i). Since s is a character string, s(len-i) is the correct character. For example, when i=0, it's s(len), which is the last character of the string (since s is 1-based).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the final output is newNumber, which is printed.\n\nI think this should work. Now, let's write the final code with proper variable declarations and syntax."
