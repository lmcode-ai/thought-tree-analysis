Wait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (left == a.get(i) && right == b.get(i)) {\n        System.out.println(++i);\n        return;\n    }\n} Wait, the code increments i before printing. So if the first element (i=0) matches, it becomes i=1, so the output is 1. So the index is 1-based. So in Fortran, if the first element (i=1) matches, then the output is 1. So the code is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_242_B) reads input: n, then n pairs of a and b. It calculates left as the minimum of all a's and right as the maximum of all b's. Then it checks if any of the pairs has a equal to left and b equal to right. If found, it outputs the index (i+1, since it increments i before printing) and exits. If none found, outputs -1.\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an integer x. If x is even and not 2, it increments to the next odd. Then it looks for the next prime number starting from there. Wait, no, actually, the code seems to check if x is prime. Let me see: the loop starts with x, and if it's not prime, increments by 2 (since even numbers except 2 can't be primes). The loop continues until it finds a prime. So the output is the next prime number greater than or equal to x, but with some conditions. Wait, the code starts with x, and if x is even and not 2, it increments to x+1 (since x%2==0 and x !=2, so x becomes x+1 if it was even). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until it finds a prime. So the output is the smallest prime >=x, but if x is even and not 2, it starts checking from x+1. Hmm, but the code's logic might have some edge cases. Let me think again. The code first checks if x is not 2 and even, then x becomes x+1. Then, in the loop, it checks for divisors from 3 up to sqrt(x). If any divisor is found, it breaks and increments x by 2 (so next odd). So the code is looking for the next prime starting from x (or x+1 if even and not 2). So the output is the next prime number >=x, but if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1. So for example, if x is 2, it stays as 2, which is prime. If x is 3, it checks and returns 3. If x is 4, it becomes 5, which is prime. So the second program's output is the next prime >=x (with x adjusted if even and not 2).\n\nThird file (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string of characters, which can include '?', and computes the number of ways to replace the '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5. The DP approach is used here, tracking possible remainders modulo 13 at each step. The DP array is built from the end of the string, using base 10^i mod 13. The final answer is the count stored in dp[n-1][5], modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain these three programs into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is input for the third. But in Fortran, we can't have intermediate I/O except for the first and last. So the first program's output (the index or -1) must be passed to the second program's input, and the second's output (the prime) must be passed to the third's input. But in a single Fortran program, we need to compute all steps without I/O in between.\n\nWait, the original setup is that each Java program is run in sequence, with the first's output being the second's input, and the second's output the third's input. So the entire chain's input is the input to the first program, and the final output is the third program's output. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and the pairs a and b).\n2. Compute the first program's result (the index or -1).\n3. Use that result as the input to the second Java program (so the second program's x is the first's output).\n4. Compute the second program's result (the prime number).\n5. Use that prime as the input to the third program (the string input is not part of the first two programs, so wait, the third program's input is a string, but where does that come from? Wait, looking back at the third Java program's code, it reads a string via sc.next(). So the third program's input is a string, which is not part of the first two programs' outputs. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the original problem says that the three Java programs are executed in sequence, with each output used as the next's input. But the third program's input is a string, which is not the output of the second program. The second program outputs a number (the prime), so the third program's input must be that number? But the third program expects a string. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the three Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But looking at the third Java program, it reads a string (cs = sc.next().toCharArray()), so the input to the third program must be a string. But the second program outputs a number (the prime). So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the third program's input is not the output of the second, but the user's input? But the problem says the entire sequence is to be translated into a single Fortran program that reads input once and outputs once. So the input to the first program is the user's input, and the output of the third program is the final output. The intermediate steps must not have I/O. Therefore, the second program's input must be the first's output, and the third's input must be the second's output. But the third program's input is a string, so the second's output (a number) must be converted into a string. Wait, but the third program's input is a string, so perhaps the second program's output is a number which is then converted to a string and passed as the third's input. But in the original Java setup, the second program's output is a number, which is then the input to the third program, which expects a string. That can't be right. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the third Java program's code again: it reads a string via sc.next(). So the third program's input is a string. But the second program's output is a number. So unless the second program's output is a string, but in the second Java program, the output is System.out.println(x), which is an integer. So the third program's input must be that integer as a string. So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the third program. So in the Fortran program, the second's output (the prime number) must be converted to a string and used as the input to the third's processing.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string, so the second's output (the prime number) must be the input string for the third program. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second's output. For example, if the second program outputs 7, then the third program's input is \"7\".\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (n and the pairs a and b).\n2. Compute first's output (index or -1).\n3. Use that as input to the second program (so x is first's output).\n4. Compute second's output (prime number).\n5. Convert that prime number to a string, which is the input to the third program.\n6. Compute third's output (the count mod 1e9+7) and print it.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part processes the first Java program's logic, then the second part processes the second's logic using the first's result, then the third part processes the third's logic using the second's result (as a string). The final output is the third's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (codeforces_242_B):\n\nThe first program reads n, then n pairs of a and b. It finds the minimum a (left) and maximum b (right). Then checks if any of the pairs has a equal to left and b equal to right. The index (1-based) of the first such pair is printed, or -1.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be used. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5? Well, the problem doesn't specify constraints, but in codeforces problems, often n is manageable. Let's assume n is up to 1e5. So in Fortran, we can read n, then read 2*n integers into two arrays a and b. Then compute left and right. Then loop through each element to check.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nThe input is x (the first program's output). The code finds the next prime >=x (with some adjustments for even numbers). The output is that prime.\n\nIn Fortran, we can write a function to check if a number is prime, then loop starting from x (adjusted as per the code's logic) until we find a prime.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC135_D):\n\nThe input is a string (the second program's output as a string). The code uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to replace '?' with digits so that the number mod13 is 5. The DP is built from the end of the string, using base 10^i mod13.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to read the string (the prime number as a string), then process it. The DP array can be a 2D array of integers (or integers mod 1e9+7). The base is 10^i mod13, but since we process from the end, we can track it as we go.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (n and the pairs a and b).\n2. Compute the first's result (index or -1).\n3. Use that as x for the second program's processing.\n4. Compute the second's result (prime).\n5. Convert the prime to a string (as a character array).\n6. Process the third program's logic using that string.\n7. Output the third's result.\n\nNow, let's think about each part's implementation.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_242_B):\n\nRead n, then 2n integers. Find left and right. Then check each pair.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead n from input. Then read 2*n integers into arrays a and b (each of size n). Then compute left and right.\n\nInitialize left to a very large value (like 1e9+5 as in Java). Right to 0.\n\nThen loop over each element, updating left and right.\n\nThen loop through each i (0-based in Java, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default). Wait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with indices starting at 1. So for i from 1 to n:\n\nif (a(i) == left .and. b(i) == right) then, output the index (i, since Java uses 0-based, but in Fortran it's 1-based. Wait, in the Java code, the first element is i=0, so the first index printed would be 1 (since i is incremented before printing). Wait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (left == a.get(i) && right == b.get(i)) {\n        System.out.println(++i);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the code increments i before printing. So if the first element (i=0) matches, it becomes i=1, so the output is 1. So the index is 1-based. So in Fortran, if the first element (i=1) matches, then the output is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, after finding the first i (1-based) where a(i) == left and b(i) == right, the first such i is the output. If none, output -1.\n\nSecond part (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nThe input is x (the first's output). The code needs to compute the next prime >=x (with adjustments for even numbers).\n\nThe steps:\n\nInitialize x as the first's output.\n\nIf x is not 2 and even, then x +=1 (since x%2 ==0 and x !=2, so x becomes odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\nCheck if x is prime. To check, for i from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2. If any i divides x, then not prime. Else, it is prime.\n\nIf not prime, add 2 to x (since we are only checking odd numbers now) and repeat.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nfor (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) { ... }\n\nIf during this loop, any i divides x, then break. Then, after the loop, if i > sqrtNum, then it's prime. Else, x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   compute sqrtNum = sqrt(x)\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2:\n\n       if x mod i ==0, break.\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break (prime found)\n\n   else x +=2\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe for loop runs from 3 to sqrt(x), stepping by 2. The loop breaks if any i divides x. After the loop, if the loop didn't break (i.e., the loop completed without finding a divisor), then i would be sqrtNum +2? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe for loop starts with i=3, then increments by 2 each time until i exceeds sqrtNum. The loop's condition is i <= sqrtNum. So after the loop, i will be sqrtNum +2 (if sqrtNum was even?), but not sure. Wait, after the loop, the value of i is the next value after the last iteration. For example, if the loop runs up to sqrtNum, then after the loop, i is sqrtNum +2 (since it increments by 2 each step). But if the loop breaks early (because x mod i ==0), then i is the value that caused the break.\n\nWait, in the code, after the for loop, the condition is if (i > sqrtNum). So if the loop completed normally (without breaking), then i would be sqrtNum +2 (if sqrtNum was even?), but actually, the loop runs until i exceeds sqrtNum. Let me see:\n\nSuppose sqrtNum is 5. The loop runs i=3,5 (since 3,5 are <=5). Then after the loop, i becomes 7 (since after the last iteration, i is 5, then i +=2 becomes 7). So i > sqrtNum (5) is true, so break, meaning x is prime.\n\nIf during the loop, say i=3 divides x, then the break is executed, so i remains 3. Then after the loop, i (3) is not greater than sqrtNum (5), so the condition is false, so x +=2 and loop again.\n\nTherefore, the code correctly finds the next prime.\n\nIn Fortran, to implement this:\n\nFunction to check if a number is prime (for small numbers, since the first program's output can be up to 1e9+5, but the second program's x could be up to that, but primes up to that might be time-consuming. However, given that the problem is from programming contests, perhaps the constraints are manageable. Alternatively, the code can be optimized.\n\nBut for the purpose of translation, let's proceed.\n\nImplement the same logic:\n\nRead x (from first's output).\n\nIf x is even and not 2, then x = x +1.\n\nThen loop:\n\n   compute sqrt_x = sqrt(x)\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n       if mod(x, i) ==0 then\n\n           is_prime = .false.\n\n           exit\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n       exit the loop\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop uses the variable i after the for loop to check if it exceeded sqrt(x). So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to track whether a divisor was found.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   sqrt_x = nint(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   found = .false.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n       if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n           found = .true.\n\n           exit\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. found) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the original code's logic is that if after checking all divisors up to sqrt(x), none divide x, then it's prime. So in this code, if found is false, then it's prime, so exit. Else, increment x by 2.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when found (i.e., a divisor was found), then the code increments x by 2 and continues. So yes, this logic is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the code starts with x, and if it's even and not 2, it increments to x+1 (so odd). Then enters the loop. So the code's first check is for x (which is now odd or 2). So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo the steps for the second part:\n\nx = first_result\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\nthen loop as above.\n\nThird part (atcoder_ABC135_D):\n\nThe input is the string representation of the second's output (the prime number). So the prime is converted to a string, and that string is processed.\n\nThe third program's code uses dynamic programming. The DP array is of size [number of characters][13], tracking the number of ways to have a certain remainder mod13 at each step.\n\nThe processing is done from the end of the string towards the beginning. The base is 10^i mod13, where i is the current position (but since we process from the end, the base starts at 1 and is multiplied by 10 each step, mod13).\n\nIn Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the string (the prime as a string). Let's say the string is s, length m.\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (m,13). Since in Fortran, arrays are column-major, but the indices can be set as needed.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the DP is built from the end. The first step (i=0 in Java corresponds to the last character). So in Fortran, perhaps we can process from the end.\n\nLet me think of the indices:\n\nIn Java, the loop is for (int i =0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n   processing the character at position cs.length-1 -i.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a string s of length m, the first character to process is s(m), then s(m-1), etc. So for each step from 1 to m (assuming 1-based), the current character is s(m - (i-1)) ?\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's index the string from 1 to m. The first iteration (i=1) processes the last character (position m), the second (i=2) processes position m-1, etc.\n\nThe DP array is of size (m,13). The base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod13.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nFor each position (from the end), for each possible previous remainder (pre), and for each possible digit (0-9 if it's a '?', or fixed digit if it's a number), compute the new remainder (base * digit + pre) mod13, and accumulate the counts.\n\nThe initial condition is dp[0][0] =1 (since for the first step (i=1, processing the last character), the previous step is i-1=0, which is the base case).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the DP is initialized as follows:\n\ndp is a 2D array where for each i, dp[i][...] is the current state. The base starts at 1, and for each step, the base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nbase =1\n\nfor (i from 0 to cs.length-1):\n\n   current character is cs[cs.length-1 -i]\n\n   if it's '?', then for each pre in 0..12:\n\n       for next in 0..9:\n\n           dp[i][(base*next + pre) mod13] += dp[i-1][pre] (or 1 if i=0)\n\n   else:\n\n       next is fixed digit, so similar.\n\n   base = base *10 mod13\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop would be over each character from the end, so for each step i (from 1 to m):\n\n   current_char = s(m - (i-1)) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the characters in reverse order. Let me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (m,13). Since in Fortran, arrays can be declared with dimensions (m,13). Let's say m is the length of the string.\n\nInitialize dp(0,:) to 0 except dp(0,0)=1 (since for the first step (i=1), the previous step is 0, which is the initial state).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the DP is built as follows:\n\nInitially, dp[0][...] is for the first character (the last character of the original string). Wait, perhaps the indices are a bit confusing. Let me re-express the Java code's loop:\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to n-1 (where n is the length of the string). For each i, the current character is the (n-1 -i)th character (so starting from the end). The base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod13.\n\nThe DP for step i (in Java) corresponds to processing the (n-1 -i)th character. The DP[i][...] holds the counts after processing the first i+1 characters (from the end).\n\nSo in Fortran, for a string of length m, we can loop from 1 to m (each step corresponds to processing the ith character from the end). Let's say for each step i (1-based), the current character is s(m -i +1). Wait, perhaps it's better to have the string stored as an array s(1:m), and for step i (from 1 to m), the current character is s(m -i +1). Wait, maybe not. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the string is \"abcd\", length 4. The first character to process is 'd' (position 4), then 'c' (3), then 'b' (2), then 'a' (1). So for i=1, process s(4); i=2, s(3); i=4, s(1).\n\nThus, for each i from 1 to m:\n\n   current_char = s(m - i +1)\n\nWait, m -i +1 for i=1 gives m, which is correct. For i=2, m-1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the string first. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the string can be stored as a character array s(1:m), and we process from s(m) down to s(1). So for each step i from 1 to m:\n\n   current_char = s(m - i +1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reverse the string first. Let me think of the steps:\n\nLet me denote the original string as s(1) to s(m). The processing order is s(m), s(m-1), ..., s(1). So for each step i (from 1 to m), the current character is s(m - i +1).\n\nThe DP array is of size (m,13). The base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod13.\n\nThe recurrence:\n\nFor each step i (processing the ith character from the end):\n\n   current_char = s(m -i +1)\n\n   if current_char is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9):\n\n       for each previous remainder pre (0-12):\n\n           new_remainder = (base * digit + pre) mod13\n\n           dp(i, new_remainder) += dp(i-1, pre)\n\n   else:\n\n       digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n       for each pre:\n\n           new_remainder = (base * digit + pre) mod13\n\n           dp(i, new_remainder) += dp(i-1, pre)\n\n   Then, after processing, mod by MOD (1e9+7).\n\n   Also, base = (base *10) mod13\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the base is updated as base = base *10 mod13 after each step. So in Fortran, after processing each step, we multiply base by 10 mod13.\n\nThe initial base is 1 (before the first step). So before the loop, base =1.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nbase is initialized to 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   process the character.\n\n   then, base = base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, so after processing the ith character (in Java's terms), the base is multiplied by 10 mod13. So in Fortran's terms, after processing step i (the ith character from the end), the base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the base is used in the current step's calculation, then updated. So in Fortran:\n\nInitialize base =1.\n\nFor each step i from 1 to m:\n\n   process the current character using the current base.\n\n   then, base = (base *10) mod13\n\nWait, no. Because in the Java code, the base is used in the current step's calculation, then updated. So in the first step (i=0 in Java), the base is 1, then after processing, it's multiplied by 10 mod13 for the next step.\n\nSo in Fortran's step i (1-based):\n\n   current base is the base before processing step i.\n\n   after processing, base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nThus, the base starts at 1 before the first step.\n\nNow, the DP array:\n\nInitially, dp(0,0) =1, and others 0.\n\nFor each step i from 1 to m:\n\n   initialize dp(i,:) to 0.\n\n   if current_char is '?', then loop over digits 0-9:\n\n       for each pre in 0..12:\n\n           new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre,13)\n\n           dp(i, new_rem) = dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n   else:\n\n       digit = value of current_char\n\n       for each pre in 0..12:\n\n           new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre,13)\n\n           dp(i, new_rem) = dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n   Then, after all additions, take mod MOD (1e9+7).\n\n   Also, after processing, base is updated.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops can be written with do loops.\n\nThe MOD is 1e9+7, so after each addition, we need to mod the value.\n\nBut in code, perhaps after all the additions, we can loop through all remainders and mod them.\n\nAlternatively, during the addition, we can do mod each time.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps better to compute the sum and then mod.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nNow, the third part's input is the string representation of the second's output (the prime number). So in Fortran, after computing the prime (x), we need to convert it to a string. In Fortran, this can be done with write and read, or using internal files.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: x\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') x\n\nThen, the length of s is len_trim(s).\n\nSo the string s is the input for the third part.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   !

However, the user's code may have n up to some limit. Alternatively, since the problem's original code uses ArrayLists, which can grow dynamically, but in Fortran, we can assume a maximum size. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are small enough. Alternatively, use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, in the code above, I used allocate(a(n), b(n)), but in the code as written, the variables a and b are declared with fixed size 100000. That's a problem. So better to declare them as allocatable.\n\nWait, let me correct that:\n\nIn the first part:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n))\n\nThen read the values.\n\nAlso, in the first part's loop for left and right:\n\nInitially, left is set to a very large value. In Fortran, the function huge(left) gives the maximum integer value, which is correct.\n\nThen, the loop over i=1 to n to find first_result.\n\nSecond part: the code for the prime is okay, but need to ensure that when x is 2, it's handled correctly. For example, if first_result is 2, then the code checks if x is 2, so the condition (x !=2 and even) is false, so x remains 2. Then the loop checks if 2 is prime, which it is.\n\nThird part:\n\nThe string conversion is done via write(s, '(i0)') prime_result. The len_trim(s) gives the length m.\n\nThe DP array is declared as dp(0:100000,0:12). But the maximum m is the length of the prime number. Since the second part's prime can be up to, say, 1e9+5, which is 10 digits, so m is up to 10. So the array can be safely declared as dp(0:100,0:12), but better to use dynamic allocation.\n\nAlternatively, since the third part's input is the string of the prime, which is at most, say, 10 characters, the array can be declared as dp(0:20,0:12).\n\nWait, in the code above, the DP array is declared as dp(0:100000,0:12), which is way too big. That's a problem. So better to use dynamic allocation here as well.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the third part's variables are declared as:\n\ninteger :: m, digit, current_char, base, dp(0:100000,0:12), pre, new_rem\n\nThis is a problem because m can be up to, say, 10 digits, so the array is way too big. So need to fix that.\n\nSo, after determining m (the length of the string s), we can allocate the DP array as:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\nallocate(dp(0:m,0:12))\n\nThen initialize it to zero.\n\nSo modifying the third part:\n\n   ! Third part variables:\n\n   integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\n   ...\n\n   m = len_trim(s)\n\n   allocate(dp(0:m,0:12))\n\n   dp = 0\n\n   dp(0,0) =1\n\n   base =1\n\n   do i=1, m\n\n      ... \n\n   end do\n\n   print*, mod(dp(m,5), MOD)\n\n   deallocate(dp)\n\nAlso, in the third part's loop over digits and pre, the code adds to dp(i, new_rem). However, in Fortran, the way to loop over all pre and digits is important. The current code loops over digit first, then pre. But in the Java code, for each pre, it loops over next digits. So the order may not matter as long as all combinations are considered.\n\nAnother thing: in the third part's code, when the current character is '?', the code loops over digit from 0 to9, and for each pre, adds to dp(i, new_rem). But in the Java code, for each pre, it loops over next digits. So the order is okay.\n\nAlso, in the code, after each addition, we mod by MOD. The code uses:\n\nif (dp(i, new_rem) >= MOD) dp(i, new_rem) = dp(i, new_rem) - MOD\n\nBut this is not sufficient, because it could be more than MOD. For example, if the sum is 2*MOD, then subtracting MOD once leaves MOD, but we need mod MOD. So better to compute:\n\ndp(i, new_rem) = mod(dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\nWait, but in the code, the current line is:\n\ndp(i, new_rem) = dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\nthen check if it exceeds MOD and subtract. But this is not correct for multiple additions. For example, if multiple digits contribute to the same new_rem, the sum could exceed MOD multiple times. So better to compute mod after each addition.\n\nAlternatively, after all the additions for a particular i, loop through all remainders and mod them by MOD.\n\nAlternatively, during the addition, compute the mod each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\ndp(i, new_rem) = mod(dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n\nBut in Fortran, the mod function can be used. However, mod in Fortran is different from Java's % operator. For example, mod(a,b) gives a result with the same sign as b. Since all values are non-negative, it should be okay.\n\nWait, in the code, the initial dp is 0, and we add dp(i-1, pre) which is non-negative. So mod( sum, MOD ) will keep it within 0 to MOD-1.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ndp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD )\n\nThis way, after each addition, the value is modded.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nInside the loops for the third part:\n\nFor the '?' case:\n\ndo digit=0,9\n\n   do pre=0,12\n\n      new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre,13)\n\n      dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, no, the loops are nested. Wait, the digit loop is outside the pre loop. So for each digit, for each pre, compute new_rem and add.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\ndo pre=0,12\n\n   do digit=0,9\n\n      new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre,13)\n\n      dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, no, the order doesn't matter as long as all combinations are considered. The key is that for each pre, and each digit, the contribution is added.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   for each digit in 0..9 (if '?'):\n\n       new_rem = (base*digit + pre) mod13\n\n       dp[i][new_rem] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\n       mod by MOD.\n\nBut in code:\n\nif it's '?', then:\n\ndo pre=0,12\n\n   do digit=0,9\n\n      new_rem = mod(base*digit + pre,13)\n\n      dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this would loop over pre and digit, but the order may not matter. Alternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ndo digit=0,9\n\n   do pre=0,12\n\n      new_rem = mod(base*digit + pre,13)\n\n      dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nEither way, all combinations are covered.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ndo pre=0,12\n\n   temp = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n   do digit=0,9\n\n      new_rem = mod(base*digit + pre,13)\n\n      dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + temp, MOD )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThis way, for each pre, the contribution is temp (dp(i-1,pre)), and for each digit, it's added to the new_rem's count.\n\nThis might be more efficient.\n\nBut in any case, the code needs to correctly accumulate the counts and mod by MOD each time.\n\nAnother thing: in the third part's code, the base is updated after processing each step. So after the loops for the current character, base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nNow, putting all corrections into the code.\n\nAlso, in the first part, the first_result is initialized to -1, and then if found, set to i. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's write the corrected Fortran code with dynamic allocation and proper array sizes.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n\n   ! First part variables\n   integer :: n, i, left, right, first_result\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n   ! Second part variables\n   integer :: x, prime_result, sqrt_x, i_div, found\n\n   ! Third part variables\n   character(len=20) :: s\n   integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n   integer :: m, digit, current_char, base\n   integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\n   ! Read first part's input\n   read*, n\n   allocate(a(n), b(n))\n   do i = 1, n\n      read*, a(i), b(i)\n   end do\n\n   !

Process second part\n   x = first_result\n   if (x /= 2 .and. mod(x, 2) == 0) then\n      x = x + 1\n   end if\n   prime_result = x\n\n   do while (true)\n      sqrt_x = nint(sqrt(real(prime_result)))\n      found = .false.\n      do i_div = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n         if (mod(prime_result, i_div) == 0) then\n            found = .true.\n            exit\n         end if\n      end do\n      if (.not. found) then\n         exit\n      else\n         prime_result = prime_result + 2\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Process third part\n   write(s, '(i0)') prime_result\n   m = len_trim(s)\n   allocate(dp(0:m, 0:12))\n   dp = 0\n   dp(0, 0) = 1\n   base = 1\n\n   do i = 1, m\n      current_char = ichar(s(m - i + 1))\n      if (current_char == ichar('?')) then\n         ! '?' case: loop over digits 0-9\n         do pre = 0, 12\n            do digit = 0, 9\n               new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre, 13)\n               dp(i, new_rem) = mod(dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n            end do\n         end do\n      else\n         digit = current_char - ichar('0')\n         do pre = 0, 12\n            new_rem = mod(base * digit + pre, 13)\n            dp(i, new_rem) = mod(dp(i, new_rem) + dp(i-1, pre), MOD)\n         end do\n      end if\n\n      ! Update base\n      base = mod(base * 10, 13)\n   end do\n\n   print*, mod(dp(m, 5), MOD)\n   deallocate(a, b, dp)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third part's loops for the '?' case, the code loops over pre and digit. However, in the code above, the loops are:\n\ndo pre =0 to 12:\n\n   do digit=0 to9:\n\n      new_rem = ... \n\n      dp(i, new_rem) += dp(i-1, pre)\n\nBut this way, for each pre, and each digit, the contribution is added. This is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the loops could be swapped, but the result is the same.\n\nAnother thing: in the third part's code, the loops for the non-'?' case:\n\ndigit is fixed, so for each pre, compute new_rem and add.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nFirst part: if the first program's output is -1, then the second program's x is -1. But the second program's code would have issues. Wait, in the first Java program, the first_result can be -1. But the second program's input is x = first_result. So if first_result is -1, then the second program's code would process x =-1. But the second Java program's code would have:\n\nif x !=2 and even, then x becomes x+1. But x is -1, which is odd. So the code proceeds to check if it's prime. But -1 is not a valid input for the second program. This indicates a problem.\n\nWait, the first program's output is either an index (1-based) between 1 and n, or -1. The second program expects an integer x. If the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is -1, which is invalid because primes are positive integers >=2. So the second program's code would loop indefinitely or crash.\n\nBut according to the problem's setup, the three programs are executed in sequence, so the first program's output must be valid input for the second. So perhaps the first program's output can't be -1 when the second program expects a valid x. But the problem's user hasn't specified any constraints, so we must assume that the input to the first program is such that the first program's output is a valid input for the second.\n\nAlternatively, the second program's code can handle x =-1. Let's see:\n\nIn the second Java program's code:\n\nx = -1.\n\nThe first condition: if x !=2 and even. Since x is -1 (odd), so the condition is false. So x remains -1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\ncompute sqrt_x = sqrt(-1) \u2192 which is an error. So the code would crash.\n\nThus, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. So the problem's input must ensure that the first program's output is a positive integer (either an index between 1 and n, or -1 is not passed to the second program). But according to the problem's description, the first program's output is used as the second's input. So if the first program outputs -1, the second program will receive it and crash. Thus, the problem's input must ensure that the first program's output is a valid x for the second program. So perhaps the first program's output is always a valid x (i.e., the first program's output is not -1). Or the second program can handle x =-1.\n\nBut in the problem's context, the user expects the code to work as per the original Java programs. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is -1, which would cause it to crash. Thus, the Fortran code must handle this case.\n\nIn the second part's code, when x is -1:\n\nx = first_result (which is -1)\n\nThen, the code checks if x !=2 and even. Since x is -1 (odd), so the condition is false. So x remains -1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = sqrt(-1) \u2192 which is an error in Fortran. Thus, the code would crash.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. So the problem's input must ensure that the first program's output is a valid x (i.e., the first program's output is not -1). Or the second program's code must handle x =-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output can't be -1 when the second program is run. For example, if the first program's output is -1, then the second program's input is -1, but the second program's code would not find a prime and loop forever. But in the problem's context, perhaps the first program's output is always a valid x (i.e., the first program's output is not -1). Or the problem's test cases ensure that.\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is valid, the code should be okay.\n\nAnother edge case: first program's output is 2. Then the second program's x is 2, which is prime, so the output is 2. The third program's input is \"2\", which is processed.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 4. Then the second program's x is 4 (even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 5. Then check if 5 is prime \u2192 yes. So third's input is \"5\".\n\nThus, the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code should be as above, with dynamic allocation and proper loops."
