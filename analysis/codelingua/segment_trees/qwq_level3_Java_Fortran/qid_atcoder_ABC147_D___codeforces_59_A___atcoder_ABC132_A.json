    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC147_D). It reads an integer n, then an array of n longs. It calculates some value ans by iterating over each bit from 0 to 59. For each bit, it counts how many numbers have that bit set. Then it computes a based on count1*(n - count1), shifts it left by (60 - i -1) bits (since for each bit i, the shifting is for the remaining bits?), and adds to ans modulo 1e9+7. Finally, it prints ans.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_59_A) takes a word, counts uppercase and lowercase letters, then converts the word to all uppercase if there are more uppercase letters, else lowercase, or lowercase if equal.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC132_A) checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. Wait, but how? The first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a word (a string). That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a string, but the first outputs a number. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here? Or perhaps the programs are not supposed to be connected in that way? Hmm, maybe the user intended that each program is run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are connected via files or pipes? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a word (string), so the first program's output must be a string. Wait, but the first program's output is a number. So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second program. The second program would then process that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs 123, the second would process \"123\" as the word, count uppercase (none) and lowercase (3), so output lowercase. Then the third program would take that output (like \"123\" or \"lowercase string\") and check if it has two characters each appearing twice. Wait, but the third program's input is a string. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output (number) is the input to the second program (as a string). Second program processes it, outputs a string (the converted word). Third program takes that string and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps in sequence, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and array A).\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans).\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's processing (treat it as a string, process it to get a modified string).\n4. Then use that modified string as input to the third program, which checks the conditions and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\", which is all lowercase letters, so it would output \"1234\" in lowercase (same as input). Then the third program would check if \"1234\" has two distinct characters each appearing twice. Since it has four distinct characters, it would output \"No\".\n\nSo the steps in Fortran need to be:\n\n- Read the first program's input (n and array A).\n- Compute ans as per first program.\n- Convert ans to a string (since that's the output of first program, which is the input to second).\n- Process that string through the second program's logic (count uppercase and lowercase, decide case).\n- Take the resulting string from second step, process through third program's logic (check for exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice).\n- Output the final result (Yes/No).\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nThe first program's logic is:\n\nRead n, then n numbers into array A.\n\nLoop over each bit from 0 to 59:\n\nFor each bit i:\n\ncount1 is the number of elements in A where the i-th bit is set.\n\na is count1*(n - count1). Then shift left by (60 - i -1) bits? Wait, the code does:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < i; j++) a = (a <<1) % div;\n\nWait, the initial a is 0, then a += count1*(n - count1). Wait, no, the code is:\n\nlong a = 0;\n\nthen a = a + count1*(n - count1). So a is set to count1*(n - count1). Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, it shifts a left by 1 each time, mod div. So the total shift is i times? Wait, the loop runs i times (since j goes from 0 to i-1, so i iterations). So shifting left by i bits. Wait, the code is:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < i; j++) { a = (a <<1) % div; }\n\nSo after the initial a = count1*(n - count1), then multiply by 2^i (since each shift left is multiply by 2, done i times). So a becomes (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div.\n\nWait, but the code is:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\na starts at 0, then a += count1*(n - count1). So a is set to count1*(n - count1). Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, a is shifted left by 1 each time. So after i shifts, it's multiplied by 2^i. Then mod div.\n\nWait, but the code is:\n\na = a + count1*(n - count1) \u2192 but initially a is 0, so a becomes count1*(n - count1). Then, for each of the i steps, multiply by 2 (shift left 1). So after i shifts, it's (count1*(n - count1)) * 2^i mod div.\n\nThen ans += a, mod div.\n\nSo the total ans is the sum over all bits i of (count1_i * (n - count1_i) * 2^i) mod (1e9+7), but summed and modded.\n\nWait, but the mod is applied at each step. Hmm, but in code, the a is modded each time. Wait, the shifting is done with mod. So each shift left is (a <<1) mod div. So the a after shifting is (a * 2) mod div. So the total a after shifting is (count1*(n - count1) * 2^i) mod div.\n\nThen ans += a, and ans mod div.\n\nSo the Fortran code for the first part must compute this.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nWe need to read n, then n integers (as 64-bit, but in Fortran, integers can be 64-bit with selected_int_kind(18). Let's use integer(8) for all variables.\n\nThe first part's steps:\n\nRead n, then read array A of size n.\n\nInitialize ans = 0.\n\ndiv is 1e9 +7.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 59:\n\ncount1 = 0\n\nloop over j from 1 to n (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. Wait, in Java, the array is 0-based, but in Fortran, if we use 1-based, we need to adjust. So in the code, the array A in Fortran will be 1-based, so the loop for j in 1 to n.\n\nWait, in Java, for (int j=0; j <n; j++), so in Fortran, j from 1 to n.\n\nSo for each element A(j), check if the i-th bit is set. How?\n\nIn Fortran, to check the i-th bit (since bits are numbered from 0?), we can do:\n\nbit = btest(A(j), i)\n\nWait, the function btest returns .true. if the bit is set. So count1 is the number of elements where btest(A(j),i) is true.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute (A(j) shr i) and AND with 1. So:\n\nif (iand(ishft(A(j), -i), 1) == 1) then count1 +=1.\n\nWait, ishft(A(j), -i) shifts right by i bits, then AND with 1 gives the i-th bit.\n\nAlternatively, using bit operations.\n\nOnce count1 is found, compute a = count1*(n - count1)\n\nThen multiply by 2^i mod div. Wait, but how to compute 2^i mod div?\n\nWait, the code in Java does shifting left by i bits, but mod div each time. So the equivalent is (count1*(n - count1) * 2^i) mod div.\n\nBut 2^i can be computed as 2**i, but for i up to 59, 2^59 is a big number, but mod 1e9+7 can be done.\n\nAlternatively, compute 2^i mod div first, then multiply by count1*(n - count1), then mod again.\n\nWait, but in code, the shifting is done step by step, but mod is applied each time. So the result is (count1*(n - count1) * 2^i) mod div.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps compute pow2 = 2**i mod div, then a = (count1*(n - count1) * pow2) mod div.\n\nWait, but 2^i can be up to 2^59, which is about 5e17. The mod is 1e9+7, so 2^i mod (1e9+7) can be computed with exponentiation.\n\nAlternatively, precompute 2^i mod div for each i from 0 to 59.\n\nBut in code, for each i, compute pow2 = 1\n\ndo j=1, i\n\npow2 = (pow2 * 2) mod div\n\nend do\n\nThen a = (count1*(n - count1) * pow2) mod div.\n\nAlternatively, since i can be up to 59, this loop is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function modulo(2**i, div). But in Fortran, 2**i may overflow for i=59 (since 2^59 is about 5e17, which is larger than the 64-bit integer limit (2^63 is ~9e18, so 2^59 is okay as 64-bit integer). Wait, 2^59 is 576460752303423488, which is less than 2^63 (9e18). So in Fortran, if using integer(8), 2**59 can be stored. So 2**i can be computed as 2**i, then mod div.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is with **. So 2**i is okay for i up to 59.\n\nSo for each i:\n\npow2 = mod(2**i, div)\n\nthen a = mod( count1*(n - count1) * pow2, div )\n\nWait, but the original code's a is (count1*(n - count1) * 2^i) mod div.\n\nYes. So that's the way.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nans = 0\n\ndiv = 10**9 +7\n\ndo i = 0,59\n\ncount1 = 0\n\ndo j = 1, n\n\nif (btest(A(j), i)) then\n\ncount1 = count1 +1\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\npow2 = mod(2**i, div)\n\nterm = mod( count1*(n - count1) * pow2, div )\n\nans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the original code, the term is added to ans, and ans is modded each time. So in Fortran, after adding term, mod again.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program.\n\nThe second program takes a string (the output of first program, which is the ans as a string). So in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process it.\n\nWait, but in the first program's code, the output is System.out.println(ans). So the output is the number ans as a string. So in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing ans, we can write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_ans\n\nwrite(s_ans, '(I0)') ans\n\ntrim the string (since write might have leading spaces?), but in Fortran, using adjustl(s_ans) to left-adjust.\n\nThen, process the string s_ans.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\ncount uppercase and lowercase letters in the string.\n\nIf uppercase > lowercase \u2192 uppercase all letters.\n\nElse lowercase.\n\nElse if equal \u2192 lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nuppercase = 0\n\nlowercase =0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_ans)\n\nch = s_ans(i:i)\n\nif (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\nuppercase = uppercase +1\n\nelse if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\nlowercase = lowercase +1\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nThen decide which case to use.\n\nThen create the new string accordingly.\n\nWait, but numbers in the string (like digits) are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters, so they are ignored in the count. Wait, the original Java code counts all characters, but in the second Java program, the input is a word (from next()), which is a sequence of characters. So in the second program, the input is the string representation of the first program's ans, which is a number. So the string will consist of digits (since ans is a number). So uppercase and lowercase counts would be zero, so the result is lowercase (the original string). So the second program's output is the same as the input string (since digits are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters). Wait, but in the Java code, the second program's input is a word, which is read via next(), which reads the next token. So if the first program outputs \"1234\", then the second program's input is \"1234\", which is a word of digits. The code counts uppercase and lowercase letters. Since all are digits, uppercase and lowercase counts are zero. So the code would choose lowercase (since uppercase <= lowercase, and equal). So the output is the same as input (digits are lowercase? Or the code converts to lowercase, but digits are already lowercase. So the output is the same as input.\n\nWait, but in the code, the output is word.toLowerCase() when equal. Since the input is all digits, the output is the same as input. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the string passed to the third program is the same as the first's output (the number as a string).\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output could have leading zeros? Or not? Well, the first program's output is a number, so it won't have leading zeros unless the number is zero. But in any case, the second program's output is the same as the input string (since digits are not letters). So the third program's input is the same as the first's output.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the first program outputs 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\". The code counts uppercase and lowercase letters. Since all are digits, both counts are zero. So the code chooses lowercase, so the output is \"1234\" (same as input). So the third program's input is \"1234\".\n\nThe third program checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. For \"1234\", there are four distinct characters, so output is \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the first program's output is a number like 1122, which is four characters, two distinct (1 and 2), each appearing twice. Then the third program would output \"Yes\".\n\nSo the third program's input is the string representation of the first program's ans.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process through the second program's logic (which may leave it as is, but in some cases may change it?), then pass that string to the third program's logic.\n\nWait, but in the case where the first program's output is a number with letters? No, the first program's output is a number, so the string is digits only. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the third program's input is the string of the first's ans.\n\nWait, but the second program's code could have a different output if the input has letters. But in our case, the input to the second program is a number's string, so no letters. So the second program's output is the same as the input. So the third program's input is the string of the first's ans.\n\nTherefore, the second program's processing can be skipped in this case, but we have to follow the sequence.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So even if the second program's processing is redundant in some cases, we must still process it as per the original sequence.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after computing ans, we must convert it to a string, process it through the second program's logic (even if it leaves it unchanged), then process through the third program's logic.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nSecond part in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing ans, convert to string s_ans.\n\nThen process s_ans through the second program's logic.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_ans, s_second\n\ninteger :: uppercase, lowercase\n\nuppercase = 0\n\nlowercase =0\n\ns_ans = trim(adjustl(s_ans))  ! Ensure no leading spaces\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_ans)\n\n   ch = s_ans(i:i)\n\n   if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   s_second = uppercase(s_ans)\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   s_second = lowercase(s_ans)\n\nelse\n\n   s_second = lowercase(s_ans)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to convert to uppercase or lowercase?\n\nFortran has functions: char, ichar, and can use lcase and ucase functions, but not sure. Alternatively, use intrinsic functions.\n\nFortran 2003 has the functions: \n\nTo uppercase: s_second = adjustl(transfer(ichar(s_ans) - 32, s_ans)) but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, loop through each character and convert.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic functions:\n\ns_second = adjustl( s_ans )\n\nthen, for uppercase:\n\ns_second = uppercase(s_ans)\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ns_second = s_ans\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n   if (s_second(i:i) >= 'a' .and. s_second(i:i) <= 'z') then\n\n      s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(s_second(i:i)) - 32)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nfor uppercase.\n\nSimilarly for lowercase:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n   if (s_second(i:i) >= 'A' .and. s_second(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n\n      s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(s_second(i:i)) + 32)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nHmm, this is a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic functions:\n\ns_second = adjustl( s_ans )\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   s_second = uppercase(s_second)\n\nelse\n\n   s_second = lowercase(s_second)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but Fortran has the functions: \n\nIntrinsic functions like 'achar' and 'ichar', but for case conversion, perhaps:\n\ns_second = s_ans\n\ncall uppercase(s_second) \u2192 but I don't recall a built-in function. So need to write a subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\nTo uppercase:\n\ns_second = s_ans\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n   c = s_second(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for lowercase:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n   c = s_second(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   ! convert to uppercase\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s_ans)\n\n      c = s_ans(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n         s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n      else\n\n         s_second(i:i) = c\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   ! convert to lowercase\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s_ans)\n\n      c = s_ans(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n         s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n      else\n\n         s_second(i:i) = c\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but s_second needs to be initialized first. Let me think:\n\nInitialize s_second as s_ans, then modify it.\n\nAlternatively, create a temporary array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\ns_second = s_ans\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n      c = s_second(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n         s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n      c = s_second(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n         s_second(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nThis way, the code converts the string to all uppercase or lowercase as needed.\n\nOkay, that's manageable.\n\nThird part: the third Java program.\n\nThe third program takes the string from the second program's output (s_second), and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in s_second.\n\nFirst, get the string s_third = s_second (trimmed).\n\nThen, create a frequency array or a hash map.\n\nIn Fortran, since characters can be any, but in our case, the input is the string from the first program's output (digits), so characters are 0-9, but maybe other characters if the first program's output is different. But the third program's logic is general.\n\nWe can use an array to count frequencies. Since characters can be any ASCII, but in practice, the input is limited to digits and possibly letters (if the second program's output has letters). But to handle all cases, perhaps use a hash map. But in Fortran, it's easier to use an array for ASCII codes.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a string, we can loop through each character and count.\n\nInitialize an array of size 256 (for ASCII) to count frequencies.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(256) :: freq = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s_third)\n\n   c = s_third(i:i)\n\n   freq(ichar(c)) = freq(ichar(c)) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, check how many characters have frequency 2, and the rest zero except two.\n\nWait, the third program's logic is:\n\nCheck if all characters are counted exactly twice, and there are exactly two distinct characters.\n\nSo:\n\ncount the number of distinct characters (those with freq >0).\n\nif the number of distinct is not 2 \u2192 no.\n\nElse, check each of the two has count 2.\n\nSo:\n\nnum_distinct = 0\n\nvalid = .true.\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (freq(i) >0) then\n\n      num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n      if (freq(i) /= 2) then\n\n         valid = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_distinct ==2 .and. valid) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, after counting frequencies:\n\nsum_counts = 0\n\ncount_2 =0\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (freq(i) >0) then\n\n      if (freq(i) ==2) then\n\n         count_2 = count_2 +1\n\n      else\n\n         valid = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n      sum_counts = sum_counts +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (sum_counts ==2 .and. count_2 ==2) then \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nnum_distinct =0\n\nall_two = .true.\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (freq(i) >0) then\n\n      num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n      if (freq(i) /=2) then\n\n         all_two = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_distinct ==2 .and. all_two) then \u2192 yes else no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n and array A.\n\n2. Compute ans as per first program.\n\n3. Convert ans to string s_ans.\n\n4. Process s_ans through second program's logic to get s_second.\n\n5. Process s_second through third program's logic to get the final output (Yes/No).\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, A(100000) ! assuming n can be up to 1e5? The first Java program uses int n, which is 32-bit, so up to 2e9, but in practice, maybe the problem constraints are smaller. But in Fortran, arrays can be declared with a large size, but need to be sure. Alternatively, read n first, then allocate A. But for simplicity, let's use a large array.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the array is size n, which can be up to 1e5 or more. So in Fortran, perhaps use an allocatable array.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume n is up to 1e5, so declare A(100000). But better to read n first, then allocate.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation.\n\nLet me think:\n\nRead n first.\n\nThen allocate A(n).\n\nBut in Fortran, the code would be:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, i, j, ans, div\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_ans, s_second, s_third\n\ninteger :: uppercase, lowercase, uppercase_count, lowercase_count\n\ninteger :: freq(0:255) = 0\n\nlogical :: valid\n\ndiv = 10**9 +7\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(A(n))\n\nread(*,*) (A(i), i=1,n)\n\n!

Let me check variable declarations.\n\nAlso, in the first loop for computing ans, the variables count1, pow2, term are inside the loop. Need to declare them inside the loop or before.\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. So inside the do i_bit loop, variables count1, pow2, term must be declared before the loop.\n\nWait, in the code above, inside the first do loop (over i_bit):\n\n   integer(8) :: count1 =0\n\n   do j =1, n\n\n      ...\n\n   end do\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside a loop like that. So need to declare them before the loop.\n\nSo correct code:\n\n...\n\nans =0\n\ndo i_bit =0,59\n\n   integer(8) :: count1, pow2, term\n\n   count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i_bit)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   pow2 = mod(2**i_bit, div)\n\n   term = mod( count1*(n - count1)*pow2, div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the declarations must be before the loop. So:\n\n...\n\nans =0\n\ninteger(8) :: count1, pow2, term\n\ndo i_bit =0,59\n\n   count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i_bit)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   pow2 = mod(2**i_bit, div)\n\n   term = mod( count1*(n - count1)*pow2, div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\nBut then count1, pow2, term are declared outside the loop. But pow2 and term are reinitialized each loop.\n\nAlternatively, declare them inside the loop's scope. But in Fortran, variables must be declared at the top of the scope.\n\nHmm, better to declare them before the loop.\n\nAlternatively, inside the loop, but in Fortran 90, you can have block IFs but not variable declarations inside loops. So better to declare them outside.\n\nSo the code would have:\n\ninteger(8) :: count1, pow2, term\n\nans =0\n\ndo i_bit =0,59\n\n   count1 =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(A(j), i_bit)) then\n\n         count1 = count1 +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   pow2 = mod(2**i_bit, div)\n\n   term = mod( count1*(n - count1)*pow2, div )\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for uppercase and lowercase counts:\n\nuppercase and lowercase are integers, declared before the loop.\n\nAlso, in the second part, s_second is a character variable, initialized as s_ans.\n\nWait, in the code above, s_second is initialized as s_ans, then modified.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you assign s_second = s_ans, the entire string is copied. Then the loops modify individual characters.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the third part's frequency array is initialized to zero.\n\nThe code for the third part is okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 1122 \u2192 the string is \"1122\".\n\nSecond program's processing: all characters are digits, so uppercase and lowercase counts are zero \u2192 choose lowercase \u2192 output \"1122\".\n\nThird program checks: characters '1' and '2', each appearing twice \u2192 output \"Yes\".\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 1234 \u2192 string \"1234\" \u2192 third program sees four distinct characters \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: output is 1111 \u2192 two distinct characters? No, only '1' \u2192 count is 4 \u2192 so no.\n\nAnother case: output is 12 \u2192 two characters, each once \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first program's ans may be very large, but in Fortran, when writing to a string with '(I0)', it should handle it as a string.\n\n- The frequency array uses 0:255, which covers all ASCII characters. So that's okay.\n\n- The shifting in the first program: 2**i may be a large number, but mod is applied. Since 2^i mod (1e9+7) can be computed correctly as 2**i is up to 2^59, which is manageable in 64-bit integers.\n\nWait, 2^59 is about 5.7e17, which is less than 2^63 (~9e18), so 64-bit integers can hold it. So mod(2**i_bit, div) is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, putting all together with proper variable declarations and structure.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the array A is declared as allocatable, so after reading n, allocate it.\n\nAlso, in the first part, the loop over j from 1 to n.\n\nNow, the final code:\n\nHere's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: n, i_bit, j, ans, div\n  integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n  character(len=20) :: s_ans, s_second, s_third\n  integer :: uppercase, lowercase\n  integer :: freq(0:255) = 0\n  logical :: valid\n  integer :: num_distinct, c_code\n\n  div = 10**9 + 7\n\n  ! Read input for first program\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(A(n))\n  read(*,*) (A(j), j=1,n)\n\n  ! Compute ans as per first Java program\n  ans = 0\n  integer(8) :: count1, pow2, term\n  do i_bit = 0, 59\n    count1 = 0\n    do j = 1, n\n      if (btest(A(j), i_bit)) then\n        count1 = count1 + 1\n      end if\n    end do\n    pow2 = mod(2**i_bit, div)\n    term = mod(count1 * (n - count1) * pow2, div)\n    ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert ans to string for second program\n  write(s_ans, '(I0)') ans\n  s_ans = adjustl(s_ans)\n\n  ! Process second program's logic\n  uppercase = 0\n  lowercase = 0\n  do j = 1, len_trim(s_ans)\n    character(1) :: c = s_ans(j:j)\n    if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n      uppercase = uppercase + 1\n    else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n      lowercase = lowercase + 1\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  s_second = s_ans\n  if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n    do j = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n      character(1) :: c = s_second(j:j)\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n        s_second(j:j) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n      end if\n    end do\n  else\n    do j = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n      character(1) :: c = s_second(j:j)\n      if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n        s_second(j:j) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n      end if\n    end do\n  end if\n\n  ! Process third program's logic\n  s_third = s_second\n  freq = 0\n  do j = 1, len_trim(s_third)\n    c_code = ichar(s_third(j:j))\n    freq(c_code) = freq(c_code) + 1\n  end do\n\n  valid = .true.\n  num_distinct = 0\n  do c_code = 0, 255\n    if (freq(c_code) > 0) then\n      num_distinct = num_distinct + 1\n      if (freq(c_code) /= 2) then\n        valid = .false.\n      end if\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  if (num_distinct == 2 .and. valid) then\n    print *, 'Yes'\n  else\n    print *, 'No'\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(A)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first part, the variables count1, pow2, term are declared inside the main program's scope. The code above declares them inside the main program, before the loop.\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, in the second part's loops, the character variables c are declared inside the loop, which is okay in Fortran 90.\n\nTesting the code for possible errors:\n\n- The first loop over i_bit from 0 to 59: correct.\n\n- The second part's string processing: correct.\n\n- The third part's frequency count: correct.\n\nNow, this should be the correct translation."
