So the substring is \"0011\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 2. So replacing gives \"4477\" \u2192 4477. So that's 4477, which is larger than 75. So for input 75, the output would be 4477?

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n from input, then calls solve(n). The solve function calculates (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0. So the output here is the first step's result, which is then used as input for the second program.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_96_B) takes a long number as input. It looks for a number made of 4s and 7s (called a \"7-segment\" maybe?), where the count of 0s and 1s in its binary form (excluding leading 1?) are equal. The loop increments a mask starting at 2, converts it to binary, checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, replaces 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parses that as a long, and when that value exceeds the input number, it outputs the previous one? Wait, the code initializes ans as -1, but in the loop, it seems to just keep updating value until it exceeds the input. Wait, the code's loop continues until value (the generated number) is less than the input. Wait, the loop condition is while (value < number). Wait, no, the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the code starts with ans = -1, and mask starts at 2. Then in each iteration, mask increments. The code converts mask to binary, takes substring(1), which removes the first character (since binary starts with '1', maybe?), then checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s in the remaining string. If so, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, then parse as a long. The value is set to that parsed number. The loop continues until value is no longer less than the input number. Then it prints the value. Wait, but when the loop exits, the value is >= number, so it might have gone over. So the output is the first such number that is >= the input? Or is it the last one before exceeding? Let me see the code again. The loop runs while value < number. Wait, no, the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the loop condition is while (value < number). Wait, no, the code is:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\nint mask = 2;\nwhile (value < number) {\n    ... compute s, then value = Long.parseLong(s)\n}\n\nWait, so the loop continues as long as the current value is less than the input number. So when the loop exits, the value is >= number. But the code then prints value. So the output is the first value that is >= the input number, but only if it meets the conditions. Wait, but the code inside the loop may not always set value. Let me see:\n\nInside the loop, after generating the binary string (substring(1)), they check if the number of zeros is equal to the number of 1s (since zeros != (length - zeros) would mean they are not equal, so continue). So only when the zeros count equals the number of 1s (since zeros = (length - zeros) implies total bits (after substring) is even?), then they proceed to replace and parse. So the value is set only when the condition is met. Otherwise, the value remains 0? Wait, no. Wait, the code starts with value =0, and in each iteration, the code may or may not set value. Wait, the code inside the loop:\n\nThe code does:\n\nString s = ...;\nint zeros = ...;\nif (zeros != (s.length() - zeros)) continue; // so if not equal, skip the rest\nthen s is replaced, then value is set to Long.parseLong(s). So in that case, the value is updated. Otherwise, the value remains as it was before. Wait, but in the first iteration, mask starts at 2. Let's see:\n\nFirst iteration: mask is 2. binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\". zeros is 1. The length is 1, so zeros (1) is not equal to (1 -1) =0. So the condition is 1 != 0 \u2192 so continue, so the code skips to next iteration. So value remains 0. Then mask becomes 3.\n\nSecond iteration: mask is 3 \u2192 binary \"11\", substring(1) is \"1\". zeros is 0. length is 1. 0 vs 1 \u2192 not equal \u2192 continue. So value still 0.\n\nmask becomes 4 \u2192 binary is 100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\". zeros is 2. length is 2 \u2192 zeros (2) equals (2-2)=0? No, 2 vs 0? Wait, zeros is 2, so s.length() is 2. So zeros (2) must equal (2 - zeros) \u2192 2 == 0 \u2192 no. So continue.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of when the condition is met. Let's see when the zeros count equals the number of 1s. For example, if the substring after first character has equal 0s and 1s. Let's take mask=6 (binary 110 \u2192 substring(1) is \"10\" \u2192 zeros=1, 1s=1 \u2192 yes. So then s becomes \"10\" \u2192 replace 0 with 4, 1 with7 \u2192 \"74\". value is 74. So if the input number is, say, 50, then 74 is the first such value that is >=50. So the code would output 74.\n\nSo the second program's output is the first number (made of 4 and7) that is >= the input number, and constructed from a binary string (after first char) with equal 0s and 1s.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the input is a string, and the output is \"Yes\" if exactly two different characters, each count 2, else \"No\".\n\nNow, the sequence is: first program's input is the user's input, its output is passed to the second program's input, then the second's output to the third's input, and the third's output is the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (the first program's input), process through all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the first program's input, which is an integer n).\n\n2. Compute the first step's result (the solve function's output: (n//3)*2 + 1 if mod(n,3)\u22600 else 0? Wait, let me recheck the Java code:\n\nThe solve function in first Java file is:\n\nSystem.out.println( (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1) )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n is 4: 4/3 is 1, so 1*2 =2, plus 1 (since mod is 1) \u2192 total 3.\n\nWait, the formula is (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo first step's output is (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3)\u22600 else 0).\n\nWait, but in Java, integer division is truncating. So for n=5: 5/3 is 1, mod 2 \u2192 so 1*2 +1 =3.\n\nWait, but let me see: the code is (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1). So for n=3 \u2192 3/3=1 \u2192 2*1 +0 \u2192 2. For n=4 \u2192 1*2 +1 \u21923. For n=5 \u21921*2+1=3. For n=6 \u21922*2 +0=4. So that's correct.\n\nSo first step's output is that value.\n\nThen, that value is the input to the second program. The second program's input is a long (so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 or similar). The second program's output is the value computed as per the code.\n\nThen, that output is the input to the third program, which is a string. Wait, the third program's input is a string. Wait, the second program's output is a number (like 74, which is a number, but when passed to the third program, it's read as a string. Wait, in the original Java sequence, the second program's output is a number (like 74), which is then the input to the third program, which reads it as a string. Wait, but in the third program's code, the input is read via in.next(), which would read the entire line as a string. So if the second program outputs \"74\", then the third program's input is the string \"74\".\n\nWait, but in the Java code for the third program, the input is read as a string via in.next(), which would take the next token. But if the second program's output is a number like 74, then the third program's input is \"74\", so the string is \"74\", which has two characters, both digits. The third program checks if exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice. So \"74\" has two different characters, each once \u2192 so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but let's see the third program's logic. The third program counts the frequency of each character in the input string. It must have exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So for example, \"AABb\" (if case matters?) but in the code, it's case-sensitive. Wait, the code uses in.next() which would read the input as is. So for the third program's input to pass, the string must have exactly two different characters, each appearing exactly two times. So \"AABB\" would be yes, \"ABAB\" also yes, but \"AB\" would be no (each appears once, two characters but counts 1 each).\n\nSo the third program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on that.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the first program's input, which is an integer n), compute the first step's result (the first Java's output), then use that as input to the second step (second Java's processing), then take that result (a number) and pass it as a string to the third step (third Java's processing), then output the final result.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial integer n from input.\n\n2. Compute first_step = (n / 3) * 2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0)\n\n3. Then, process second_step: take first_step as the input number (the input to the second Java program), and compute the value as per the second Java's logic.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a long. So first_step must be a long. Since in the first step, n is an integer, so first_step can be an integer, but in Fortran, we can use integer*8 to handle large numbers.\n\nThen, the second step's output is a number (the value computed in the second Java's code). Let's call that second_result.\n\nThen, the third step takes the string representation of second_result (as a string) and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo the third step's input is the string representation of second_result.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute first_step.\n\n- Compute second_result based on first_step.\n\n- Convert second_result to a string.\n\n- Check the string for the third step's condition.\n\n- Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement each step in Fortran without I/O except first and last.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first step: straightforward.\n\nSecond step: the second Java's logic is more complex. Let's think about how to implement that in Fortran.\n\nThe second program's algorithm:\n\nWe need to find the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 such that:\n\n- The number is >= the input (first_step).\n\n- The number is formed by replacing 0s and 1s in a binary string (after the first character) where the count of 0s equals the count of 1s.\n\nWait, the process is:\n\nStart with mask starting at 2, increment each time.\n\nFor each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string.\n\n- Take substring starting at index 1 (so remove the first character).\n\n- Check if the number of 0s in this substring equals the number of 1s.\n\n- If yes, then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with7, forming a number. Parse that as a long.\n\n- Keep track of the first such number that is >= the input number (first_step). Wait, no, the loop runs while the current value (the parsed number) is less than the input. Wait, the loop continues until value < input. So when the loop exits, the value is the first one that is >= input. Because once value >= input, the loop stops, and we output that value.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   process mask, compute s, then if conditions met, set value to the parsed s.\n\n   mask increments each time.\n\n}\n\nWait, but the value is initially 0. So the first time through, if the mask's processing gives a valid s, then value is set to that. If that value is less than the input, the loop continues. The loop continues until the value is no longer less than the input. So the final value is the first one that is >= the input. So the code outputs the first such number that is >= the input.\n\nWait, but the code may have multiple masks that generate valid numbers. The first one that is >= the input is the one to be output. Because once the value reaches a number >= input, the loop stops, and that's the value printed.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the input is 50. The first valid number is 74 (as in the earlier example). So when mask=6, the value becomes 74. Since 74 >=50, the loop condition (value <50) is false, so the loop stops, and 74 is printed.\n\nAnother example: if the input is 74, then when mask=6, the value is 74, which is equal to input, so the loop stops and outputs 74.\n\nIf the input is 75, then the next valid number would be when mask is higher. Let's see mask=9: binary is 1001 \u2192 substring(1) is \"001\". zeros count is 2, 1s is 1 \u2192 not equal. So no. mask=10 \u2192 binary 1010 \u2192 substring(1) is \"010\" \u2192 zeros: 2, 1s:1 \u2192 no. mask=12 \u2192 binary 1100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"100\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 1 \u2192 no. mask=14 \u2192 binary 1110 \u2192 substring(1) is \"110\" \u2192 zeros 1, 1s 2 \u2192 no. mask=15 \u2192 1111 \u2192 substring(1) is \"111\" \u2192 zeros 0, 1s 3 \u2192 no. mask=17 \u2192 10001 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0001\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1s 1 \u2192 no. mask= 18 \u2192 10010 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0010\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1s 1 \u2192 no. Hmm, maybe mask= 22 \u2192 binary 10110 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0110\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 2 \u2192 yes. So the string is \"0110\" \u2192 replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927 \u2192 \"4774\" \u2192 4774. So if input is 75, the first valid number >=75 is 4774? Wait, but maybe there's a smaller one. Let me think of mask= 6 gives 74, which is less than 75. So the next valid mask would be mask= 10? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, mask= 6 gives 74. mask= 7 \u2192 binary 111 \u2192 substring(1) is \"11\" \u2192 zeros 0, 1s 2 \u2192 no. mask=8 \u2192 1000 \u2192 substring(1) is \"000\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1s 0 \u2192 no. mask=9 \u2192 1001 \u2192 substring(1) is \"001\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1 \u2192 no. mask=10 \u2192 1010 \u2192 substring(1) is \"010\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1 \u2192 no. mask=11 \u2192 1011 \u2192 substring(1) is \"011\" \u2192 zeros 1, 1s 2 \u2192 no. mask=12 \u2192 1100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"100\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1 \u2192 no. mask=13 \u2192 1101 \u2192 substring(1) is \"101\" \u2192 zeros 1, 1s 2 \u2192 no. mask=14 \u2192 1110 \u2192 substring(1) is \"110\" \u2192 zeros 1, 1s 2 \u2192 no. mask=15 \u2192 1111 \u2192 substring(1) is \"111\" \u2192 zeros 0 \u2192 no. mask=16 \u2192 10000 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0000\" \u2192 zeros 4 \u2192 no. mask=17 \u2192 10001 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0001\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1 \u2192 no. mask=18 \u2192 10010 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0010\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1 \u2192 no. mask=19 \u2192 10011 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0011\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 2 \u2192 yes! So the substring is \"0011\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 2. So replacing gives \"4477\" \u2192 4477. So that's 4477, which is larger than 75. So for input 75, the output would be 4477? Or is there a smaller one?\n\nWait, mask= 20 \u2192 binary 10100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0100\" \u2192 zeros 3, 1 \u2192 no. mask=21 \u2192 10101 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0101\" \u2192 zeros 2, 1s 2 \u2192 yes. So the substring is \"0101\" \u2192 becomes \"4747\" \u2192 4747. Which is smaller than 4477? No, 4747 is larger than 4477? Wait, 4477 is 4477, 4747 is 4747. So 4477 is smaller. So mask=19 gives 4477, which is the first after 74. So for input 75, the output is 4477.\n\nSo the algorithm is to find the smallest number (in terms of numeric value) that is >= the input, constructed as per the rules.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is incrementing mask each time, so the first valid number that is >= the input is the one that is found first. Since mask increases, the numbers generated may not be in order. Wait, but the mask is increasing, but the generated numbers may not be in order. For example, mask=6 gives 74, mask=19 gives 4477, which is higher. So the first valid number after 74 that is >= input (75) is 4477. So the code would output that.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the second step's input is first_step (the output of first step). Let's call that input_num.\n\nWe need to loop over mask starting at 2, incrementing each time. For each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting at position 2 (since Fortran is 1-based). Wait, in Java, substring(1) would take from index 1 (second character). So in Fortran, the binary string is generated, then we take from the second character onward.\n\n- Check if the number of '0's equals the number of '1's in that substring.\n\n- If yes, then replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's, forming a string, then convert to a number.\n\n- Compare this number with input_num. If it's >= input_num, then that's the value to return. But we need to find the first such occurrence where the generated number is >= input_num. Wait, but the loop in Java continues until the value (the generated number) is less than input_num. Wait, the loop is while (value < input_num). So the loop runs as long as the current value is less than input_num. So the first time the generated number is >= input_num, the loop stops and returns that value. But how does the code track that?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nloop while (value < number):\n\n   process mask to get s, then compute value as the parsed s (if conditions met).\n\n   mask increments.\n\nWait, but the value is initially 0. So the first valid number (when mask=6 gives 74) would set value to 74. If input_num is 50, then 74 >=50 \u2192 the loop condition (value <50) is false \u2192 loop stops, and the value is 74, which is printed.\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input. So once the value becomes >= input, the loop stops, and the current value is the one to output. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize value to 0.\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nloop:\n\n   process mask to get the possible s.\n\n   if conditions met, compute the new value (the parsed s).\n\n   if the new value is >= input_num, then return it.\n\n   else, continue.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop continues until the value is no longer less than input_num. So the first time the generated value is >= input_num, the loop stops and returns that value. So in Fortran, the loop can be structured as:\n\nDO WHILE (value < input_num)\n\n   process mask, compute possible new value.\n\n   if conditions met, set value to the new value.\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nENDDO\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the value may not be updated in each iteration. For example, if the current mask doesn't meet the condition, then the value remains as it was. So the loop may not terminate if no valid number is found. But according to the problem's second Java code, it must eventually find one? Or perhaps the problem ensures that there is a solution.\n\nAssuming that there is always a solution, the loop will eventually find a mask that meets the condition and the value becomes >= input_num.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the steps for the second step are:\n\nInitialize value =0, mask=2.\n\nloop:\n\n   convert mask to binary string, then substring from 2nd character.\n\n   count zeros and ones in that substring.\n\n   if zeros == ones:\n\n       create the new string by replacing 0\u21924 and 1\u21927.\n\n       parse that string to a number (new_val).\n\n       if new_val >= input_num:\n\n           return new_val.\n\n       else:\n\n           set value = new_val.\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing (value remains as before).\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\n   repeat until value < input_num.\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < input_num). So the loop continues until value is no longer less than input_num. So the loop will exit when value >= input_num. But how do we ensure that the new_val is the one that caused the value to be >=?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code in Fortran should be structured as:\n\nDO\n\n   process mask to get possible s.\n\n   if conditions met:\n\n       compute new_val.\n\n       if new_val >= input_num:\n\n           exit loop and return new_val.\n\n       else:\n\n           value = new_val\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nLOOP UNTIL (some condition?)\n\nAlternatively, the loop can be:\n\nDO\n\n   process mask to get possible s.\n\n   if conditions met:\n\n       compute new_val.\n\n       if new_val >= input_num:\n\n           return new_val\n\n       else:\n\n           value = new_val\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nLOOP\n\nBut this would loop indefinitely unless a condition is met. So perhaps the loop should continue until the new_val is found to be >= input_num, then exit.\n\nAlternatively, the loop can be structured as:\n\nDO\n\n   process mask to see if it meets the condition.\n\n   if yes:\n\n       compute new_val.\n\n       if new_val >= input_num:\n\n           exit loop and return new_val.\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nLOOP\n\nBut how to structure this in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, the loop can be:\n\nmask =2\n\nvalue =0\n\nDO\n\n   process mask to get s.\n\n   if conditions met:\n\n       new_val = parsed s.\n\n       if new_val >= input_num:\n\n           exit loop and return new_val.\n\n       else:\n\n           value = new_val\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\n   if (mask exceeds some limit?) \u2192 but the problem may not have a limit.\n\nBut since the problem's second Java code works, we can assume that eventually a valid mask will be found.\n\nThus, in Fortran code:\n\nWe can write a loop that runs indefinitely until a valid new_val >= input_num is found.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, converting mask to binary string.\n\nIn Fortran, to get the binary string of an integer, we can use a function. Let's think of writing a function to convert an integer to a binary string.\n\nFunction to_binary(n) result(bin_str)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n\n   integer :: i, len\n\n   bin_str = ''\n\n   if (n ==0) then\n\n      bin_str = '0'\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\n   do while (n >0)\n\n      bin_str = trim(adjustl( mod(n,2) )) // bin_str\n\n      n = n /2\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation is a bit tricky. Alternatively, we can build the string as an array of characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array and then reversing it.\n\nAlternatively, use a recursive function or iterative approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function, but I don't think Fortran has a built-in to get binary string. So we need to write a helper function.\n\nOnce we have the binary string, we can take the substring starting from the second character (since the first character is the leading '1' from the binary representation).\n\nThen, count the number of '0's and '1's in that substring.\n\nIf they are equal, then replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's, then parse that as a number.\n\nParsing the string to a number can be done with a loop, multiplying by 10 and adding the digit.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for the second step in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine second_step(input_num, output_val)\n\n   integer*8, intent(in) :: input_num\n\n   integer*8, intent(out) :: output_val\n\n   integer :: mask\n\n   integer*8 :: new_val\n\n   character(len=100) :: bin_str, s, temp_str\n\n   integer :: zeros, ones, i, len_s\n\n   mask =2\n\n   output_val =0\n\n   do\n\n      ! Convert mask to binary string\n\n      bin_str = to_binary(mask)\n\n      ! Take substring from second character\n\n      if (len_trim(bin_str) <2) then\n\n          ! mask is 2 \u2192 binary '10', so substring is '0'\n\n          s = bin_str(2:2)\n\n      else\n\n          s = bin_str(2:)\n\n      end if\n\n      zeros =0\n\n      ones =0\n\n      do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n          if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n              zeros = zeros +1\n\n          else\n\n              ones = ones +1\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (zeros == ones) then\n\n          ! replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927\n\n          temp_str = s\n\n          do i=1, len_trim(temp_str)\n\n              if (temp_str(i:i) == '0') then\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '4'\n\n              else\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '7'\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n          ! parse to integer*8\n\n          read(temp_str, '(I10)') new_val\n\n          if (new_val >= input_num) then\n\n              output_val = new_val\n\n              return\n\n          else\n\n              output_val = new_val\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n      mask = mask +1\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the loop, after processing mask, if the condition is met, then we check if new_val is >= input_num. If yes, return it. Else, set output_val to new_val and continue. Wait, but in the code, the output_val is the value that is being tracked. Wait, perhaps the code should track the current value (the maximum so far?), but the original Java code's loop continues until the current value (the new_val) is >= input_num. Hmm, perhaps the code above is not exactly following the Java's logic.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop runs while (value < number). The value is initially 0. Each time a valid s is found, the value is set to the new_val. So the loop continues until the value (the last valid new_val) is no longer less than the input.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nloop while (value < number):\n\n   process mask to get s.\n\n   if conditions met:\n\n       value = parsed s.\n\n   mask increments.\n\nSo the loop continues as long as the current value is less than the input. So the loop stops when the value is >= input. The value at that point is the one to return.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the loop should continue until the value (the current value) is >= input_num. The value is updated only when a valid s is found. So the code should be:\n\nsubroutine second_step(input_num, output_val)\n\n   integer*8, intent(in) :: input_num\n\n   integer*8, intent(out) :: output_val\n\n   integer :: mask\n\n   integer*8 :: value\n\n   character(len=100) :: bin_str, s, temp_str\n\n   integer :: zeros, ones, i, len_s\n\n   mask =2\n\n   value =0\n\n   do while (value < input_num)\n\n      ! process mask\n\n      bin_str = to_binary(mask)\n\n      s = bin_str(2:)\n\n      zeros =0\n\n      ones =0\n\n      do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n          if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n              zeros = zeros +1\n\n          else\n\n              ones = ones +1\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (zeros == ones) then\n\n          ! replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927\n\n          temp_str = s\n\n          do i=1, len_trim(temp_str)\n\n              if (temp_str(i:i) == '0') then\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '4'\n\n              else\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '7'\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n          read(temp_str, '(I10)') new_val\n\n          value = new_val\n\n      end if\n\n      mask = mask +1\n\n   end do\n\n   output_val = value\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in this code, the value is set to new_val only when the condition is met. So the loop continues until value (the last valid new_val) is >= input_num. Thus, when the loop exits, the value is the first one that is >= input_num. Because the loop runs while value < input_num. So when the value becomes >=, the loop stops, and the output is value.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nNow, the helper function to_binary needs to be written.\n\nFunction to_binary(n) result(bin_str)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n\n   integer :: i, len\n\n   bin_str = ''\n\n   if (n ==0) then\n\n      bin_str = '0'\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\n   do while (n >0)\n\n      bin_str = trim(adjustl( mod(n,2) )) // bin_str\n\n      n = n /2\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function returns a value with the same sign as the divisor. Since n is positive, mod(n,2) will be 0 or 1. But when we append it to the string, we need to convert the integer to a character. So perhaps:\n\nbin_str = trim(adjustl( char(ichar('0') + mod(n,2)) )) // bin_str\n\nYes, because mod(n,2) is 0 or 1, so adding to '0' gives the character '0' or '1'.\n\nThus, the function can be written as:\n\nfunction to_binary(n) result(bin_str)\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n   integer :: temp, remainder\n   bin_str = ''\n   if (n == 0) then\n      bin_str = '0'\n      return\n   end if\n   temp = n\n   do while (temp > 0)\n      remainder = mod(temp, 2)\n      bin_str = char(ichar('0') + remainder) // bin_str\n      temp = temp / 2\n   end do\nend function\n\nThis should build the binary string correctly.\n\nNow, the third step: the input is the string representation of the second step's output (output_val). We need to check if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nIn Fortran, we can:\n\n- Convert the output_val to a string (e.g., using write statement into a character variable).\n\n- Count the frequency of each character.\n\n- Check if there are exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2.\n\nSo steps:\n\nsubroutine third_step(input_num, result)\n\n   integer*8, intent(in) :: input_num\n\n   logical, intent(out) :: result\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: counts(256) =0\n\n   integer :: i, num_chars=0\n\n   write(s, '(I0)') input_num\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n      counts(ichar(s(i:i))) = counts(ichar(s(i:i))) +1\n\n   end do\n\n   num_chars =0\n\n   do i=1, 256\n\n      if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n          if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n              result = .false.\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          num_chars = num_chars +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (num_chars ==2) then\n\n      result = .true.\n\n   else\n\n      result = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the counts array can be of size 256 (for ASCII). We can initialize it to zero. Then, for each character in the string, increment the count for its ASCII code. Then, check that exactly two of the counts are 2, and others are zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can track the unique characters and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, since the string length must be exactly 4 (since each character appears twice and two distinct characters \u2192 total length 4?), no, wait, two distinct characters each appearing twice \u2192 total length 4. So the input string must be of length 4. Wait, no, the third program's input can be any string. For example, if the second step's output is 7 (a single digit), then the string is \"7\", which has length 1 \u2192 so the third program would output \"No\".\n\nThus, the third step's code must check the entire string.\n\nSo in the subroutine:\n\n- Convert the input_num to a string s.\n\n- Count the frequency of each character in s.\n\n- Check if exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2.\n\nThus, the code above should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main program will:\n\n1. Read the initial integer n.\n\n2. Compute first_step = (n /3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0).\n\n3. Call second_step with first_step to get second_result.\n\n4. Call third_step with second_result to get the boolean result.\n\n5. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   integer*8 :: first_step, second_result\n\n   logical :: third_result\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   first_step = (n /3)*2 + mod(n,3)  ! Because mod(n,3) is 0,1,2 \u2192 adding 1 if mod is non-zero.\n\n   ! Wait, let's see:\n\n   ! The original Java code is (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1)\n\n   ! So when mod(n,3) is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total (n/3)*2.\n\n   ! When mod is 1 or 2 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 (n/3)*2 +1.\n\n   ! So in Fortran, first_step = (n/3)*2 + (mod(n,3) /=0)\n\n   ! Because mod(n,3) is 0,1,2 \u2192 mod(n,3)/=0 is 0 or 1.\n\n   first_step = (n /3)*2 + (mod(n,3) /=0)\n\n   call second_step(first_step, second_result)\n\n   call third_step(second_result, third_result)\n\n   if (third_result) then\n\n      print *, 'Yes'\n\n   else\n\n      print *, 'No'\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nNow, the second_step subroutine:\n\nsubroutine second_step(input_num, output_val)\n\n   integer*8, intent(in) :: input_num\n\n   integer*8, intent(out) :: output_val\n\n   integer :: mask\n\n   integer*8 :: value\n\n   character(len=100) :: bin_str, s, temp_str\n\n   integer :: zeros, ones, i, len_s\n\n   mask =2\n\n   value =0\n\n   do while (value < input_num)\n\n      bin_str = to_binary(mask)\n\n      s = bin_str(2:)\n\n      zeros =0\n\n      ones =0\n\n      do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n          if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n              zeros = zeros +1\n\n          else\n\n              ones = ones +1\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (zeros == ones) then\n\n          temp_str = s\n\n          do i=1, len_trim(temp_str)\n\n              if (temp_str(i:i) == '0') then\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '4'\n\n              else\n\n                  temp_str(i:i) = '7'\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n          read(temp_str, '(I10)') value\n\n      end if\n\n      mask = mask +1\n\n   end do\n\n   output_val = value\n\nend subroutine second_step\n\nWait, but in the code above, when the condition is met, the value is set to the parsed new_val (temp_str). But in the loop, after setting value, the loop continues. The loop continues until value is no longer less than input_num. So when the new_val is set to a value >= input_num, the loop will exit, and output_val is set to that value.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'value' is set to the parsed temp_str only when the condition is met. So if the current mask's processing meets the condition and the parsed value is >= input_num, then the loop will exit, and output_val is that value.

Since it's used in the subroutine, we need to declare it.

The loop over i from 1 to 256 checks each ASCII code. For each code with count>0, it checks if the count is exactly 2. If any count is not 2, returns false. Then, after counting the number of such characters (num_chars), if exactly two, returns true.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput to first program: 3 \u2192 first_step is (3/3)*2 +0 \u2192 2.\n\nSecond step's input is 2. The second program's code would process:\n\nLooking for the first number >=2.\n\nmask starts at 2:\n\nmask=2 \u2192 binary '10' \u2192 substring '0' \u2192 zeros=1, ones=0 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary '11' \u2192 substring '1' \u2192 zeros=0, ones=1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary '100' \u2192 substring '00' \u2192 zeros=2, ones=0 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=5 \u2192 '101' \u2192 substring '01' \u2192 zeros=1, ones=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo s is '01' \u2192 replaced to '47' \u2192 47. 47 >=2 \u2192 so output is 47.\n\nThird step's input is 47 \u2192 string \"47\" \u2192 two characters, each count 1 \u2192 so output \"No\".\n\nThus, the final output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but according to the third program's logic, the string \"47\" has two distinct characters, each appearing once \u2192 so output \"No\".\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput to first program: 4 \u2192 first_step is (4/3)*2 +1 \u2192 1*2+1=3.\n\nSecond step's input is 3.\n\nLooking for the first number >=3.\n\nmask=2 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=5 \u2192 '01' \u2192 47 \u2192 47 >=3 \u2192 yes. So output is 47 \u2192 third step's input is \"47\" \u2192 same as before \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where third step returns yes:\n\nSuppose the second step's output is 44 \u2192 string \"44\" \u2192 two '4's \u2192 but only one distinct character \u2192 so \"No\".\n\nIf second step's output is 4477 \u2192 \"4477\" \u2192 two distinct chars (4 and7), each appearing twice \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nThus, if the second step's output is 4477, then third step returns yes.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The binary conversion function may not handle zero, but in the second step's mask starts at 2, so mask is at least 2, so bin_str won't be zero.\n\n- The read statement in second_step may have issues if the temp_str is longer than the input format. Using '(I10)' may not be sufficient for very large numbers. But in the problem's context, perhaps the numbers are manageable. Alternatively, use '(I20)'.\n\n- The third_step's counts array uses 256 elements, which covers all ASCII characters. But in Fortran, the default integer for counts may be 4 bytes, which is okay.\n\n- The third_step's loop over 1 to 256 may be slow, but for small strings, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work."
