    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_617_B). It reads an integer n, then reads n integers. It collects the indices where the value is 1 into a list. If the list is empty, output 0. Otherwise, compute the product of the differences between consecutive indices. So the output here is either 0 or the product. \n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_96_B) takes that output as input. It reads a long number, then finds the smallest number made of 4s and 7s (starting from 2's binary, but I need to see the logic). The loop increments mask, converts to binary, checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s (since zeros != s.length - zeros would mean they are equal?), wait no, the condition is if zeros != s.length - zeros, then continue. Wait, the code says if zeros != s.length - zeros, then skip. Wait, the code is checking if the number of zeros is not equal to the number of 1s. Because s.length is zeros + ones. So zeros != (total - zeros) implies that zeros != ones. So the condition is to skip when zeros != ones. So the code is looking for binary numbers where the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. Then, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as long, and check if it's >= the input number. Wait, the loop is while value < number. So it's looking for the first such number that is >= the input. The ans is set to -1, but the code seems to just loop until value exceeds the input, then print the value. Wait, the loop is while value < number, so mask increments until the generated value is >= number. Then, the code breaks and prints the value. So the output here is the smallest number made of 4 and 7 with equal 0s and 1s in its binary form (excluding leading 1?), but wait the mask starts at 2, so the binary is of mask starting from 2. Wait, the code uses mask starting at 2, then converts to binary, takes substring(1), which removes the first character. So for mask=2, binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\". Then, the zeros count is 1, length is 1, so zeros (1) equals length - zeros (0)? Wait, no. Wait, the substring(1) for mask=2 (binary \"10\") would be \"0\", so length is 1. zeros is 1. So zeros (1) equals (length - zeros) (0)? No, so the condition would be 1 != 0, so it would not continue? Wait, the code says if zeros != s.length - zeros, then continue. Wait, the condition is: if zeros != (length - zeros), then continue (so skip the rest of the loop). So only when zeros equals (length - zeros) do we proceed. So for mask=2, the substring is \"0\", zeros is 1, length is 1. 1 != (1-1)=0 \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 continue, so the code skips. So mask increments. Hmm, maybe I need to think through the code again. \n\nWait, the code is looking for numbers where the number of 0s equals the number of 1s in the binary string (after substring). So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0s and 1s. So the length must be even? Because 0s and 1s count must be equal. So the code is generating numbers where the binary (after substring) has equal 0s and 1s, then replacing 0\u21924 and 1\u21927 to form a number. The first such number that is >= the input number is the output. \n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_276_B) takes that output as input. It reads a string, counts the frequency of each character. Then counts how many have odd counts. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's even but more than 1, then output \"First\" or \"Second\". Wait, the condition is: if oddCount <=1 OR (oddCount is odd?), because the code says \"if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first, else second. Wait, the code's condition is: if (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2 !=0)), then first, else second. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first. Wait, no, the code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2 !=0)) \u2192 then first. Wait, the code's condition is written as:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first. Wait, but oddCount can be even or odd. Let me see:\n\nThe condition is: if (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount is odd)), then first. Because oddCount %2 !=0 \u2192 odd. So the condition is: if the number of characters with odd counts is \u22641, or it's an odd number (regardless of being more than 1?), then first. Else second. Wait, but if oddCount is 3 (which is odd and >1), then first. If it's 2 (even), then second. So the logic is that if the count of odd frequencies is 0,1, or any odd number (even if it's more than 1), then first player wins. Wait, but the problem might be about forming a palindrome. The minimal condition for a palindrome is that at most one character has an odd count. So if the input allows forming a palindrome, then the first player can win? Or maybe the problem is different. Anyway, the code's logic is as per the given code.\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (from first Java's input), process all three steps without intermediate I/O, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array of integers (from first Java program). Collect indices where value is 1. Compute product of differences between consecutive indices (or 0 if none).\n\n2. Take that product as the input to the second step. Find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 with equal 0s and 1s in their binary (after some processing) that is >= the product. \n\n3. Take that number as the input to the third step. Convert it to a string (since the third Java program reads a string?), wait no. Wait the third Java program reads a string from input. Wait, the second program's output is a number (like 44, 47, etc.), which is printed as a string. So the third program reads that as a string. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second's output. \n\nWait, the second program outputs a long, which is printed as a string. So the third program's input is that string. So in the Fortran program, the second step's output is a number, which must be converted to a string to be the input to the third step's processing.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the initial input (n and the array of integers).\n\n- Process first step (compute the product).\n\n- Process second step (compute the minimal 4/7 number >= product).\n\n- Convert that number to a string (since third step needs it as a string input).\n\n- Process third step (count characters' frequencies, determine \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead n, then n integers. Collect indices (0-based?) where the value is 1. Then compute the product of differences between consecutive indices. \n\nWait in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, but we can track the indices as 0-based. So for each element in the array (1-based in Fortran), if the value is 1, store the index (i-1, since Fortran starts at 1). \n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++), so the first element is index 0. So in Fortran, if the array is stored as 1-based, then the index would be (i in Fortran) -1. So when reading the array, for each element, if it is 1, add (i-1) to the list. \n\nOnce the list is built, if empty, product is 0. Else, compute product of (arr(i) - arr(i-1)) for i from 2 to size. \n\nSecond step: \n\nTake the product (from first step) as the input number. Need to find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 with equal 0s and 1s in their binary (after some processing). \n\nThe second Java program's logic is a bit tricky. Let me re-express it:\n\nThe code starts with mask =2, then loops:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string, then take substring(1) \u2192 which removes the first character. \n\nWait, the binary string of mask is, for example, mask=2 is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\". \n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time. \n\nThe substring(1) is taking the binary string without the first character. \n\nThen, the code checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s in that substring. \n\nIf yes, then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and check if it's >= the input number. \n\nThe loop continues until the generated value is >= the input number. The first such value is the output. \n\nWait, the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the code is:\n\nlong value = 0;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   s = ... \n\n   value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\nInitially, ans is -1, value is 0. \n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each iteration. \n\nThe code constructs s as the binary string of mask, then substring(1). \n\nThen counts zeros. \n\nIf zeros == (length - zeros) \u2192 then proceed. \n\nThen replace 0\u21924 and 1\u21927 \u2192 s becomes the string of 4 and 7. \n\nThen value is parsed as Long.parseLong(s). \n\nWait, but the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the loop is actually a while loop? Wait, no, the code is a while loop? Let me check the code again:\n\nWait the code is:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong();\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nint mask =2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   s = ... \n\n   ... \n\n   value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is written as:\n\nThe loop is a while loop that runs as long as value < number. Wait, but inside the loop, the code may not set value each time. Wait, the code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask is incremented each time. \n\nThe code constructs s, then checks if the zeros count is equal to the number of 1s. \n\nIf yes, then the code replaces 0 and 1 to 4 and7, then parses to value. \n\nBut if the condition is not met (i.e., the zeros != ones), then the code skips to the next iteration, so value remains 0? \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nmask starts at 2. \n\nloop:\n\n   s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1);\n\n   count zeros. \n\n   if (zeros != (length - zeros)) \u2192 continue (so skip the rest of the loop body). \n\n   else:\n\n      replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927 \u2192 s becomes the new string. \n\n      value = Long.parseLong(s). \n\n   then, after that, the loop continues. \n\nWait, but the loop is while (value < number). Wait, no, the loop is not a while loop. Wait, looking back at the code:\n\nWait the code is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    long number = in.nextLong();\n\n    long ans = -1, value = 0;\n\n    int mask = 2;\n\n    while (value < number) {\n\n        String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n        int zeros = 0;\n\n        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\n        if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\n        s = s.replace('0', '4');\n\n        s = s.replace('1', '7');\n\n        value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(value);\n\n}\n\nAh, the loop is a while loop that runs while value < number. \n\nWait, but initially, value is 0. So the loop runs as long as value < number. \n\nInside the loop, mask is incremented each time. \n\nThe code constructs s from mask's binary (substring(1)), then checks if the zeros count equals the ones count. \n\nIf yes, then the code replaces 0\u21924 and 1\u21927, parses to value. \n\nIf not, it skips to the next iteration (continues). \n\nWait, but after the replace, the value is set. \n\nSo the loop continues until the value (after processing) is >= number. \n\nOnce the loop exits, the value is printed. \n\nSo the loop is designed to find the first s (from mask) that meets the condition, and when parsed as a number, is >= the input number. \n\nWait, but the loop may process multiple masks until the value is found. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nStart with mask=2, then increment mask each time. \n\nFor each mask, compute s as binary string of mask, without the first character. \n\nCheck if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s in s. \n\nIf yes, then create the 4/7 string, parse to value. \n\nIf the value is >= number, then the loop stops, and that value is the answer. \n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. \n\nWait, but the loop is structured as:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   if condition met:\n\n      compute value. \n\n   else:\n\n      continue (so mask increments, but value remains as before?)\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe loop runs as long as value < number. \n\nInside the loop, mask is first used to create s. \n\nIf the condition (zeros == ones) is met, then the code computes the new value. \n\nIf not, the code skips to the next iteration (mask increments, but value remains as before). \n\nWait, but the loop's continuation depends on the new value. \n\nWait, the loop is a while loop that runs while value < number. \n\nSo, for example, suppose the first valid s gives a value of 100, and the input number is 50. Then the loop exits, and the value is 100. \n\nBut if the first valid s gives a value of 40 (less than 50), then the loop continues. \n\nWait, but after processing that mask, the value is set to 40, which is still less than 50, so the loop continues. \n\nThen mask increments, and the next mask is processed. \n\nSo the loop will keep going until the computed value is >= number. \n\nTherefore, the code is finding the minimal such value that is >= the input number. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nThe second step requires generating numbers made of 4 and 7, with the binary (after substring) having equal 0s and 1s. \n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the mask starts at 2, and increments each time. \n\nFor each mask, we need to:\n\n1. Convert mask to binary string. \n\n2. Take substring starting at position 1 (i.e., remove the first character). \n\n3. Count the number of '0's in this substring. \n\n4. If the count of 0s equals the count of 1s (since total length is len, zeros = (len - zeros) \u2192 zeros = len/2 \u2192 so len must be even), then proceed. \n\n5. Replace 0 with '4', 1 with '7', forming a string. \n\n6. Parse this string as a long. \n\n7. If this value is >= the input number (from first step), then this is the candidate. \n\nThe loop continues until the value is found. \n\nThe problem is to find the smallest such value that is >= the input. \n\nNow, in Fortran, handling binary strings and string manipulations can be a bit tricky. \n\nFirst, for each mask, we need to generate its binary string. \n\nFortran has functions to convert integers to strings, but not directly to binary. So perhaps we can write a helper function to convert an integer to a binary string. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute the binary digits manually. \n\nLet me think of steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nInitialize mask =2, value =0. \n\nLoop while value < input_number (from first step):\n\n   s = binary string of mask, without first character. \n\n   count zeros in s. \n\n   if zeros == (length of s - zeros) \u2192 then:\n\n      create the 4/7 string by replacing 0\u21924 and 1\u21927. \n\n      parse to value. \n\n      if this value is >= input_number, then break and return it. \n\n   else:\n\n      continue. \n\n   mask = mask +1 \n\nWait, but the loop must continue until the value is found. \n\nWait, the loop in Java is a while loop that runs as long as value < number. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is structured so that once the value is set to a value >= number, the loop exits. \n\nSo in Fortran, the loop can be a do-while loop, but Fortran doesn't have do-while. So perhaps a loop with a condition. \n\nAlternatively, a loop that runs indefinitely until the condition is met, then exits. \n\nNow, the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nWe need to generate the binary string of mask, then process it. \n\nFirst, writing a function to get the binary string of an integer (mask). \n\nFunction to_binary(n) returns a string. \n\nAlternatively, for each mask, we can compute its binary digits. \n\nLet me think of how to get the binary string. \n\nFor example, for mask=2 (binary 10), the substring is \"0\". \n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary 11 \u2192 substring is \"1\". \n\nmask=4 \u2192 100 \u2192 substring is \"00\". \n\nmask=5 \u2192 101 \u2192 substring is \"01\". \n\nmask=6 \u2192 110 \u2192 substring is \"10\". \n\nmask=7 \u2192 111 \u2192 substring is \"11\". \n\nmask=8 \u2192 1000 \u2192 substring is \"000\". \n\nSo the substring is the binary string of mask without the first character. \n\nTo get the binary string of mask, we can do:\n\nbinary_str = ''\n\ntemp = mask\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   remainder = mod(temp,2)\n\n   binary_str = trim(adjustl(achar(ichar('0') + remainder))) // binary_str\n\n   temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nThis would give the binary string in reverse? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor mask=2 (binary 10):\n\ntemp=2 \u2192 mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 remainder 0 \u2192 append to left? \n\nWait, the code appends the remainder to the left. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\ntemp=2 \u2192 remainder 0 \u2192 binary_str becomes '0'\n\ntemp=1 \u2192 remainder 1 \u2192 binary_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10'\n\ntemp=0 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nSo the binary_str is '10', which is correct. \n\nSo the function would return the correct binary string. \n\nThen, the substring is from the second character (since first is removed). \n\nSo for mask=2, the binary_str is '10', substring(2:) \u2192 '0'. \n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are indexed from 1. So the substring starting at position 2 would be the second character. \n\nWait, the substring after removing the first character would be the string from position 2 to end. \n\nSo for '10', substring(2:) is '0'. \n\nSo the code for the substring is s = binary_str(2:). \n\nThen, count the number of '0's in s. \n\nIf the count of '0's equals the number of '1's (i.e., count0 == (len_trim(s) - count0)), then proceed. \n\nThen, replace each '0' with '4' and '1' with '7', forming the new string. \n\nParse that string to a number. \n\nOnce that number is >= the input number (from first step), we can break and return it. \n\nNow, the third step takes this number (as a string) and processes it as per the third Java program. \n\nThe third Java program reads a string, counts the frequency of each character, then checks the number of characters with odd counts. \n\nThe output is \"First\" if the count is 0,1, or odd (regardless of being more than 1?), else \"Second\". \n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first. \n\nWait, oddCount %2 !=0 means it's odd. So the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). \n\nSo if oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 first. \n\n1 \u2192 yes \u2192 first. \n\n3 \u2192 yes \u2192 first. \n\n2 \u2192 no \u2192 second. \n\n4 \u2192 no \u2192 second. \n\nSo the condition is met when the number of odd counts is even? No, wait:\n\nWait, the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). \n\nSo for oddCount=3 (odd and >1 \u2192 yes \u2192 first). \n\nFor oddCount=2 (even \u2192 no \u2192 second). \n\nThus, the third program outputs \"First\" if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number (even if it's more than 1). \n\nWait, but the problem might be about forming a palindrome. The minimal condition for a palindrome is that at most one character has an odd count. So if the count is more than one odd, then it's impossible. But the code's logic is different. \n\nAnyway, the code's logic is as written. \n\nIn Fortran, the third step would take the string (from the second step's output, which is the number as a string), count each character's frequency, then compute the number of characters with odd counts. \n\nThen decide based on the condition. \n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the initial input (n and the array), process all steps, and output the final result. \n\nFirst, variables needed:\n\nFor first step:\n\n- n: integer. \n\n- array: array of integers (size n). \n\n- indices: list of integers where the value is 1. \n\n- product: integer (or long, but in Fortran, use integer*8 or similar). \n\nWait, the product can be very large. The first Java program uses long, so in Fortran, we need to use a 64-bit integer. \n\nSecond step variables:\n\n- input_number (from first step's product). \n\n- mask: integer (starts at 2, increments). \n\n- binary_str: character string. \n\n- s: substring. \n\n- count0: integer. \n\n- value: integer*8 (since it's a long). \n\nThird step variables:\n\n- the string from the second step's value (as a string). \n\n- frequency array (for each character). \n\n- oddCount: integer. \n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers. \n\nCollect indices where the value is 1. \n\nCompute product. \n\nThen process second step. \n\nThen convert the second step's value to a string. \n\nProcess third step. \n\nFinally, output the result. \n\nNow, let's start coding. \n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n, then the array. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, i\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\ninteger :: index_count =0\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: indices\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nread *, arr(1:n)\n\nThen, collect indices where arr(i) ==1. \n\nindex_count =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if (arr(i) ==1) then\n\n      index_count = index_count +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nallocate(indices(index_count))\n\nindex_count =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if (arr(i) ==1) then\n\n      index_count = index_count +1\n\n      indices(index_count) = i-1 ! since Java uses 0-based, so subtract 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen compute the product. \n\nif (index_count ==0) then\n\n   product =0\n\nelse\n\n   product =1\n\n   do i=2, index_count\n\n      product = product * (indices(i) - indices(i-1))\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, product must be a large integer. So use integer(8):\n\ninteger(8) :: product\n\n...\n\nThen, proceed to second step. \n\nSecond step:\n\ninput_number = product\n\nmask =2\n\nvalue =0_8\n\ndo while (value < input_number)\n\n   ! compute binary string of mask\n\n   temp = mask\n\n   binary_str = ''\n\n   do while (temp >0)\n\n      remainder = mod(temp,2)\n\n      binary_str = char(ichar('0') + remainder) // binary_str\n\n      temp = temp /2\n\n   end do\n\n   ! substring from position 2\n\n   if (len_trim(binary_str) <1) then\n\n      s = ''\n\n   else\n\n      s = binary_str(2:)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! count zeros in s\n\n   count0 =0\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n      if (s(i:i) == '0') count0 = count0 +1\n\n   end do\n\n   if (count0 == (len_trim(s) - count0)) then\n\n      ! valid, replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927\n\n      new_str = ''\n\n      do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n         c = s(i:i)\n\n         if (c == '0') then\n\n            new_str = new_str // '4'\n\n         else\n\n            new_str = new_str // '7'\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      ! parse to value\n\n      read(new_str, *) value\n\n      ! check if value >= input_number\n\n      if (value >= input_number) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the loop, after replacing, we set value and check. \n\nWait, the loop is do while (value < input_number). \n\nWait, in the code above, the loop is a do-while? No, in Fortran, the loop is a do loop with a condition. \n\nWait, the code above is a do loop that runs indefinitely until exit. \n\nWait, the loop is structured as:\n\ndo while (value < input_number)\n\n   ... \n\n   if (condition met) then:\n\n      compute value. \n\n      if (value >= input_number) exit\n\n   end if\n\n   mask +=1 \n\nend do \n\nWait, no, the code above is written as a do-while? Not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the loop is:\n\nmask =2\n\nvalue =0_8\n\ndo\n\n   ... compute s, etc. \n\n   if (condition met):\n\n      compute new_str \u2192 value. \n\n      if (value >= input_number) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\n   if (value >= input_number) exit\n\nend do \n\nHmm, perhaps better to structure it as:\n\nmask =2\n\nvalue =0_8\n\ndo while (value < input_number)\n\n   ... \n\n   compute s, etc. \n\n   if (condition met):\n\n      compute new_str \u2192 value. \n\n      if (value >= input_number) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do \n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < input_number). \n\nWait, the loop will continue as long as value is less than input_number. \n\nInside the loop, after processing the mask, if the new value is still less than input_number, then mask increments. \n\nWait, but the code may have set value to a higher value, so the loop may exit. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nmask =2\n\nvalue =0_8\n\ndo\n\n   ! process mask\n\n   ... \n\n   if (condition met):\n\n      compute new_str \u2192 value. \n\n      if (value >= input_number) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do \n\nThis way, the loop runs until the value is found. \n\nBut in this case, the loop will run indefinitely until the value is found. \n\nNow, the code for the second step is getting a bit involved. \n\nOnce the value is found, we proceed to the third step. \n\nThird step:\n\nTake the value (from second step) and convert it to a string. \n\nstring_val = trim(adjustl( str( value ) )) \n\nWait, in Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done via write statement. \n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_third\n\nwrite(s_third, '(I20)') value\n\ns_third = adjustl(s_third) \n\nThen, process this string. \n\nInitialize a frequency array. Since characters are digits (4 and7), but the third program's input is the string of the number, which is made of 4 and7. \n\nWait, the third Java program's input is a string read from input. The second program's output is a number (like 44, 47, etc.), so the third program's input is that number as a string. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the string is the string representation of the value. \n\nNow, count the frequency of each character in s_third. \n\nWe can use a hash map, but in Fortran, perhaps an array for each possible character. \n\nSince the characters are only '4' and '7', but maybe other digits if the value is larger? Wait no, the second step's output is a number made of 4 and7. \n\nWait, the second step's code replaces 0\u21924 and 1\u21927. So the resulting string is made of 4 and7. \n\nThus, the third step's input is a string of 4 and7. \n\nThus, the characters are only '4' and '7'. \n\nThus, we can have a frequency array for '4' and '7'. \n\nAlternatively, use a dictionary. \n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger :: count4=0, count7=0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_third)\n\n   c = s_third(i:i)\n\n   if (c == '4') then\n\n      count4 = count4 +1\n\n   else if (c == '7') then\n\n      count7 = count7 +1\n\n   else\n\n      ! error?\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, oddCount is the number of counts that are odd. \n\noddCount =0\n\nif (mod(count4,2) /=0) oddCount = oddCount +1\n\nif (mod(count7,2) /=0) oddCount = oddCount +1\n\nThen, check the condition:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n\n   result = 'First'\n\nelse\n\n   result = 'Second'\n\nend if\n\nWait, the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the final result is stored in a string variable. \n\nFinally, output the result. \n\nPutting all together. \n\nNow, handling the variables and steps in order. \n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. \n\nNow, let's structure the code step by step. \n\nFirst, read the initial input (n and array). \n\nThen compute the product. \n\nThen process second step. \n\nThen process third step. \n\nFinally, print the result. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nBut first, note that in Fortran, strings have fixed lengths, so need to manage that. \n\nAlso, the second step's binary string may be long, but in practice, the mask won't be too big. \n\nNow, here's the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, index_count, mask, count0, oddCount\n\n  integer(8) :: product, input_number, value\n\n  character(len=20) :: s_third, result\n\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, indices\n\n  character(len=20) :: binary_str, s, new_str\n\n  !

Output the result\n\n  print *, trim(result)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some issues here. \n\nFirst, in the second step's loop, the code may not exit if the mask is too large. But the problem's constraints should ensure that a solution exists. \n\nAlso, in the binary_str calculation, the initial binary_str is an empty string. Then, in each iteration of the do while (temp>0), we append the remainder as a character. \n\nWait, in the code above, the binary_str is initialized as an empty string. Then, in each loop:\n\nremainder = mod(temp,2)\n\nbinary_str = char(...) // binary_str \u2192 which prepends the character. \n\nThus, the first remainder (LSB) is the first character, but since we are building the string by prepending, the final string is the correct binary representation. \n\nWait, for example, mask=2 (binary 10):\n\ntemp=2 \u2192 remainder 0 \u2192 binary_str becomes '0'\n\ntemp=1 \u2192 remainder 1 \u2192 binary_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10'\n\nYes, correct. \n\nAnother example, mask=3 (binary 11):\n\ntemp=3 \u2192 rem 1 \u2192 binary_str is '1'\n\ntemp=1 \u2192 rem 1 \u2192 '1'// '1' \u2192 '11'\n\nYes. \n\nThus, the binary_str is correct. \n\nAnother point: in the second step's loop, after replacing, we read new_str into value. \n\nBut in Fortran, the read statement may have an error if the string is empty. \n\nBut since the code only proceeds when the substring s is non-empty (since the mask starts at 2, which has binary length at least 2, so s is at least length 1). \n\nWait, mask=2 \u2192 binary_str is '10', s is '0' \u2192 length 1. \n\nThus, new_str is '4', which is valid. \n\nThus, the read should work. \n\nAnother point: in the third step, the code counts the characters. \n\nNow, the final output is 'First' or 'Second'. \n\nTesting this code with sample inputs would be needed, but given the time constraints, proceed. \n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The second step's loop may not terminate. But according to the problem's constraints, there must be a solution. \n\n- The binary_str may have leading zeros after substring? No, because the substring is after the first character of the binary string of mask. \n\nWait, mask starts at 2, so binary_str starts with '1', so the substring starts at position 2. \n\nThus, the substring s can have leading zeros. \n\nFor example, mask=4 (binary 100 \u2192 substring is '00'), which has two zeros and zero ones \u2192 count0=2, length is 2 \u2192 2 == 2 \u2192 valid. \n\nThus, the code would process that. \n\nAnother possible issue is the variable declarations. \n\nIn the second step's loop, variables like temp, remainder need to be declared. \n\nIn the code above, inside the loop, temp is declared as integer. But in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. \n\nAh, right! The code as written has a problem. \n\nThe variables temp and remainder must be declared before the loop. \n\nSo, in the second step's code:\n\nInside the program:\n\n...\n\n  ! Second step variables\n\n  integer :: temp, remainder, istat\n\n  character(len=20) :: binary_str, s, new_str\n\n  do\n\n     ! Convert mask to binary string\n\n     binary_str = ''\n\n     temp = mask\n\n     remainder =0\n\n     do while (temp >0)\n\n        remainder = mod(temp,2)\n\n        binary_str = char(ichar('0') + remainder) // binary_str\n\n        temp = temp /2\n\n     end do\n\n     ...\n\n  end do\n\nThus, variables temp and remainder must be declared before the loop. \n\nAlso, the istat variable for the read statement. \n\nThus, in the code outline, variables must be declared. \n\nAnother point: in the second step's loop, after replacing, the code checks if value >= input_number. \n\nBut the code proceeds to exit only if that is true. \n\nWait, in the code above, after replacing, the code does:\n\nread(new_str, *, iostat=istat) value\n\nif (istat ==0 .and. value >= input_number) then\n\n   exit\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the code may have parsed the value, but it's still less than input_number. \n\nThus, the loop continues. \n\nThus, the loop will continue until a valid s is found where the parsed value is >= input_number. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nAnother possible issue is the length of the strings. \n\nThe binary_str is declared as len=20, but for large masks, it may need more. But given the problem constraints, perhaps it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, use a larger length. \n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, assuming the input is manageable. \n\nThus, the final Fortran code would look like this, with proper variable declarations and structure."
