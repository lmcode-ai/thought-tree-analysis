Wait, the code's code is: if (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n} Wait, no, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n} Wait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n} Wait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add (9 - r).\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n} Wait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then decide between 9 - r and r, but with an exception for the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). Wait, the code's code is: if (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) \u2192 then add r (so that the first digit isn't zero).\n\n    else \u2192 add 9 - r.\n\n} else \u2192 add r. So the exception is only when the digit is the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). In that case, we add r (9) instead of 0 (9-9=0). So the code is trying to choose the digit which is the smaller between r and 9 - r, except when it's the first digit and the other option is zero (so the digit is 9, and choosing 0 would lead to leading zero, so we keep 9). So in Fortran, for each digit (starting from the end of the original number), we need to process each digit as follows:",

Fourth iteration: x=1 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 x becomes 0 \u2192 now, after division, x is 0. So in this case, the first digit is when x was 1 before division. So when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number), the x before division is 1, so x/10 is 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer from input, processes it through some calculations, and outputs a result. The second file (codeforces_514_A) takes that output as input, processes it, and outputs another number. The third file (codeforces_579_A) takes the second output and finally outputs the count of 1s in its binary representation. The goal is to combine all three into one Fortran program without any intermediate I/O except for the first read and last write.\n\nLet me break down each step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's solve() function takes a position, finds the nearest sequence start index, calculates the start value, and prints (position - start) +1. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. \n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to read the input (the initial position), perform these calculations, then pass the result to the next step without printing. \n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_514_A) takes a number, processes each digit. For each digit, if 9 - digit is less than the digit, it uses 9 - digit instead, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero. Then it constructs a new number from these digits. \n\nWait, the code in the second Java program loops while x >0, so it's processing each digit from the end (since it's taking mod 10 each time). The list is built in reverse order? Because when you take x mod 10, that's the last digit, then x is divided by 10. The list is being filled in reverse order of the digits. Then when building newNumber, it's adding each element multiplied by 10^pow, so the first element (the original last digit) is the first to be added, so the list is reversed. Wait, let me see:\n\nIn the code, the loop is:\n\nwhile (x >0) {\n    r = x%10; // last digit\n    ... decide to add r or 9-r\n    list.add( ... );\n    x = x/10;\n}\n\nSo the list is filled with the digits in reverse order (from least significant to most). Then when building newNumber, the first element (the first digit processed, which is the original last digit) is multiplied by 10^0, then next by 10^1, etc. So the list is in the order of the digits from least to most significant. So the newNumber is constructed correctly as the reversed digits. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the original number is 123. Then x starts as 123, r is 3, then x becomes 12. Next iteration, r is 2, x becomes 1. Then r is 1, x becomes 0. The list would be [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (3) is added as 3*10^0, then 2*10^1, then 1*10^2, so the new number is 321. But the code's logic is to replace each digit with the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit. Wait, the condition is if (9 - r < r). So for each digit, choose the smaller between r and 9 - r. Except when it's the last digit (the original first digit?), and 9 - r is zero. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) list.add(r); else list.add(9 - r);\n\nWait, when x is divided by 10, if x/10 is zero, that means we are at the first digit (since x was the original number's first digit). So in that case, if 9 - r is zero (so r is 9?), then we add r instead of 9 - r (which would be zero). Wait, but 9 - r would be zero only if r is 9. So in that case, if the first digit is 9, then we can't replace it with 0, because that would lead to a leading zero. So the code is handling that edge case.\n\nHmm, so the code is processing each digit, and for each digit, choosing the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit, except when it's the first digit and 9 - r is zero (so the digit is 9), in which case we leave it as 9. \n\nSo in Fortran, I need to take the result from the first step (the output of the first program), process each digit similarly, and compute the new number. \n\nThird program (codeforces_579_A) takes the number from the second step, converts it to binary, counts the number of 1's. \n\nSo the entire process is:\n\nInput -> first program's output -> second program's output -> third program's output (count of 1s in binary).\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to read the initial input (the position for the first program), process all three steps in sequence, and output the final count.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the position from the first program's input).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the value (position - startIndex) +1, where startIndex is found via the loops in the first Java code).\n\n3. Take that result and process it through the second program's logic to get the new number.\n\n4. Take that new number, convert to binary, count the 1s, and output that count.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nThe first program's solve function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nThen, find the nearest sequence start index. The sequence is such that the value at index i is 1 + (i-1)*i/2. The code uses a loop to find the largest power of two where the value is less than position, then increments until the next value exceeds position.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1.\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position: multiply by 2.\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position: increment nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nThen startIndex is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nThe result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo in Fortran, I can implement this with loops. Let's code this part.\n\nSecond part (second Java program):\n\nThe input here is the result from the first step. Let's call this value 'first_result'.\n\nWe need to process each digit of first_result. Let me think of how to get each digit.\n\nIn Fortran, to process each digit, perhaps we can loop, taking mod 10 and dividing by 10, similar to Java. But since Fortran doesn't have a list, we can store the digits in an array, then process them.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the digits are processed in reverse order (from least to most significant). So in Fortran, we can collect the digits in an array, then process them in reverse order (since the first digit processed is the last digit of the original number).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the second Java code, the loop is:\n\nwhile (x >0) {\n\n    r = x%10 \u2192 this is the last digit.\n\n    process r \u2192 add to list.\n\n    x = x /10 \u2192 next digits.\n\n}\n\nSo the digits are stored in the list in reverse order (from least to most significant). Then when building the new number, the first element (the first digit processed, which is the original last digit) is multiplied by 10^0, then next by 10^1, etc. So the new number is the digits in the order they were stored in the list, which is the reverse of the original digits. Wait, no, the original number's digits are stored in the list in reverse order (since we process from the end). So the list is [d0, d1, ..., dn], where d0 is the original last digit, d1 the next, etc. So when building the new number, the digits are in the same order as the list, so the new number is the reversed digits. But the code's processing is to choose for each digit the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit, except for the first digit (original first digit) when it's 9.\n\nWait, in the code's condition:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 when x is the first digit (since x/10 is zero), and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9), then we add r (9) instead of 9 - r (0). So that the first digit doesn't become zero, which would drop leading zeros.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each digit (starting from the end of the number), we need to process each digit, decide whether to take r or 9 - r, except for the first digit (the original first digit) when it's 9.\n\nWait, but in the code, the first digit is the one when x is the original number's first digit. Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the input to the second program is 1234.\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nx starts as 1234 \u2192 r =4 \u2192 add to list (list now [4])\n\nx becomes 123 \u2192 r=3 \u2192 add \u2192 list [4,3]\n\nx becomes 12 \u2192 r=2 \u2192 add \u2192 list [4,3,2]\n\nx becomes 1 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 add \u2192 list [4,3,2,1]\n\nx becomes 0 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThen, the list is [4,3,2,1]. The new number is 4*10^0 +3*10^1 +2*10^2 +1*10^3 \u2192 4321. But the code's processing for each digit:\n\nFor each digit in the list (the digits are 4,3,2,1):\n\nWait, the first digit in the list is the original last digit (4). The first digit of the original number is 1 (the first digit in the list is the last digit of the original number). Wait, the original number is 1234, so the first digit is 1, the last is 4. The list is [4,3,2,1], so the first element is the last digit of the original number, and the last element is the first digit of the original number.\n\nSo when processing each digit in the list, the first element (4) is the last digit of the original number, so when building the new number, the first element is the first digit of the new number. So the new number is 4321 in this case. But the code's processing for each digit:\n\nFor each digit in the list (the elements of the list):\n\nWait, the code's loop for the list is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < list.size(); i++) \u2192 the elements are processed in order, so the first element (4) is the first digit of the new number, so the new number is 4321. \n\nBut the code's processing for each digit (r) is:\n\nif (9 - r < r \u2192 choose 9 - r, else choose r. Except when it's the first digit (original first digit) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). \n\nWait, the condition in the code is:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 \u2192 which is when x is the first digit (since x is now 1 in the example above when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number)), and 9 - r ==0 \u2192 so r is 9. \n\nWait, in the example above, when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number, which is 1), the x is 1 (since x was divided by 10 each time). So x/10 is 0, so the condition is true. But 9 - r (9-1=8) is not zero, so the condition (9 - r ==0) is false. So the code would add 9 - r (8) instead of r (1). \n\nWait, but in the example, the first digit is 1, so 9-1=8 is less than 1? No, 8 is larger than 1. Wait, 9 - r is 8, which is greater than r (1). So the condition (9 - r < r) is 8 <1 \u2192 false. So the code would add r (1). \n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then choose 9 - r, else choose r. Except when it's the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9), then choose r.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then choose 9 - r, else choose r. But with an exception when it's the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9), then we choose r (so that the first digit isn't zero).\n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add (9 - r).\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then decide between 9 - r and r, but with an exception for the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). \n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && (9 - r) ==0) \u2192 then add r (so that the first digit isn't zero).\n\n    else \u2192 add 9 - r.\n\n} else \u2192 add r.\n\nSo the exception is only when the digit is the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). In that case, we add r (9) instead of 0 (9-9=0). \n\nSo the code is trying to choose the digit which is the smaller between r and 9 - r, except when it's the first digit and the other option is zero (so the digit is 9, and choosing 0 would lead to leading zero, so we keep 9).\n\nSo in Fortran, for each digit (starting from the end of the original number), we need to process each digit as follows:\n\nFor each digit (r):\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then choose 9 - r, unless it's the first digit (original first digit) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). In that case, choose r.\n\nElse choose r.\n\nSo the steps for the second part:\n\nTake the first_result (from first program's output), process each digit:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the processed digits.\n\nLoop while first_result >0:\n\n    r = mod(first_result,10)\n\n    x = first_result (before division?)\n\nWait, need to track the original x's value to know when we are at the first digit.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the x is the original number being processed. So in the first iteration, x is the original number. So to track whether we are at the first digit, we can track the original number's length, but perhaps in Fortran, we can track the current x's value and see when it's the first digit (when x is divided down to the first digit, so when x is between 1 and 9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the position of the digit. Let me think of variables:\n\nWe can have a variable indicating whether we are at the first digit. The first digit is when the remaining x after division is 0. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe first digit is when x is reduced to a single digit (i.e., x is between 1 and 9). So when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number), the x after division would be 0. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 1234. The first iteration:\n\nx = 1234 \u2192 r =4 \u2192 x becomes 123 \u2192 not first digit.\n\nSecond iteration: x=123 \u2192 r=3 \u2192 x becomes 12 \u2192 not first.\n\nThird: x=12 \u2192 r=2 \u2192 x becomes 1 \u2192 not first (since 1 is a single digit, but it's the first digit of the original number).\n\nFourth iteration: x=1 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 x becomes 0 \u2192 now, after division, x is 0. So in this case, the first digit is when x was 1 before division. So when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number), the x before division is 1, so x/10 is 0. \n\nThus, in the code, the condition is (x /10 ==0) \u2192 which is true when x is the first digit (the original first digit).\n\nSo in Fortran, during processing each digit, we can track the current x (the remaining number before division). So for each step:\n\ncurrent_x = first_result (initially, but we need to track it as we process each digit).\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, we can do:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the digits. Let's say digits array of size, say, 20 (since numbers can be up to 1e18, which has 18 digits). \n\nInitialize an index for the array, starting at 1.\n\nThen:\n\ncurrent_x = first_result\n\ndigits_count = 0\n\ndo while (current_x >0)\n\n    r = mod(current_x,10)\n\n    digits(digits_count +1) = r\n\n    digits_count = digits_count +1\n\n    current_x = current_x /10\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this would store the digits in reverse order (the first element is the last digit of the original number). \n\nThen, we need to process each digit in the digits array. \n\nWait, but the processing for each digit must consider whether it is the first digit (original first digit). \n\nThe first digit in the original number is the last element in the digits array (since digits are stored in reverse order). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the example of 1234, the digits array would be [4,3,2,1]. The first digit of the original number is 1, which is the last element in the array (digits(4)). \n\nSo when processing each digit in the digits array, the first element (4) is the last digit of the original number, and the last element (1) is the first digit of the original number. \n\nThus, when processing the digits array, the first digit (original first digit) is at position digits_count (the last element in the array). \n\nWait, but in the code's logic, when processing each digit, the current x (before division) is the current value of the number. So for the first digit (original first digit), the x before division is the original first digit (e.g., 1 in the example). \n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, we can track the original number's digits and their positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the digits in reverse order (from the first digit of the original number to the last). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to process each digit in the digits array, but track whether it is the first digit (original first digit). \n\nWait, the first digit (original first digit) is the last element in the digits array. So when processing the digits array, the first element is the last digit of the original number, and the last element is the first digit. \n\nThus, when processing each digit in the digits array, the first digit (original first digit) is the last element. \n\nSo for each digit in the digits array, except the last one, the digit is not the first digit. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nSuppose the original number is 1234. The digits array is [4,3,2,1]. The first digit (original first digit) is 1, which is the last element in the array. \n\nThus, when processing each digit in the digits array, the first element (4) is the last digit of the original number, and the last element (1) is the first digit. \n\nSo when processing the digits array, the first digit (original first digit) is the last element. \n\nThus, when processing each digit in the digits array, the first digit (original first digit) is the last element. \n\nTherefore, when processing each digit in the digits array, the first digit (original first digit) is the last element. \n\nThus, for each digit in the digits array, except the last one, the digit is not the first digit. \n\nWait, but how do we know when we are processing the first digit (original first digit)? \n\nThe first digit is the last element in the digits array. \n\nThus, when processing the digits array from first to last (i from 1 to digits_count), the first digit (original first digit) is at i = digits_count. \n\nThus, for each digit in the digits array, we can check if it's the first digit (original first digit) by seeing if it's the last element. \n\nWait, but in the code's logic, the condition is based on the current x (the value before division) being such that x/10 ==0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, we can track the position of each digit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can process the digits in the digits array, and for each digit (starting from the first element, which is the last digit of the original number), except the last element (the first digit of the original number), the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track the original x's value before division for each step. \n\nWait, let me think of the steps again:\n\nIn the Java code, for each iteration:\n\ncurrent x is the remaining number (starts as first_result, then divided by 10 each time).\n\nr = x mod 10 \u2192 the current digit (the last digit of the remaining x).\n\nThen, the code checks if (x /10 ==0) \u2192 which is true when x is a single digit (the first digit of the original number).\n\nThus, in Fortran, during the processing of each digit, we can track the current x before division. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the processed digits (the new digits after transformation).\n\nInitialize current_x = first_result.\n\ndigits_count =0\n\ndo while (current_x >0)\n\n    r = mod(current_x,10)\n\n    x_before = current_x\n\n    if ( (x_before /10) ==0 ) then \u2192 this is the first digit (original first digit)\n\n        if ( (9 - r) ==0 ) then \u2192 then r is 9 \u2192 so we can't choose 0, so add r.\n\n            new_digit = r\n\n        else \u2192 choose between 9 - r and r.\n\n            if (9 - r < r) then \u2192 choose 9 - r.\n\n                new_digit = 9 - r\n\n            else \u2192 choose r.\n\n                new_digit = r\n\n        end if\n\n    else \u2192 not the first digit.\n\n        if (9 - r < r) then \u2192 choose 9 - r.\n\n            new_digit = 9 - r\n\n        else \u2192 choose r.\n\n            new_digit = r\n\n    end if\n\n    add new_digit to the processed_digits array.\n\n    current_x = current_x /10\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the processed_digits array would be in the order of the digits from last to first (since we process the last digit first). \n\nWait, in this approach, the first iteration processes the last digit of the original number, and the last iteration processes the first digit. \n\nThus, the processed_digits array would have the digits in the same order as the original digits' reverse. \n\nWait, but when building the new number, the digits need to be in the same order as the original digits (since the new number is the transformed digits in the same order as the original digits). \n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nIn the Java code, the list is filled with the digits in reverse order (from last to first), and then the new number is built by taking each element in the list (so the first element is the last digit of the original number, which becomes the first digit of the new number). \n\nWait, the new number is constructed as:\n\nnewNumber = newNumber + list.get(i) * 10^pow \u2192 so the first element (the last digit of the original number) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), the next by 10^1 (tens), etc. \n\nThus, the new number is the digits in the list's order, which is the reverse of the original digits. \n\nWait, no. The original number's digits are, say, 1234 \u2192 list is [4,3,2,1]. The new number is 4*1 +3*10 +2*100 +1*1000 \u2192 4321. So the new number is the reverse of the original number's digits. \n\nWait, but the code's processing is to choose for each digit the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit. So the new number is the transformed digits in the same order as the original digits' reverse. \n\nWait, but the code's processing is to process each digit (from last to first), and the new number is built by taking the transformed digits in the same order as they were processed (so the first digit of the new number is the transformed last digit of the original number). \n\nThus, the new number is the transformed digits in the reverse order of the original digits. \n\nWait, but the code's new number is the transformed digits in the same order as the list, which is the reverse of the original digits. \n\nThus, the new number is the transformed digits arranged in the reverse order of the original digits. \n\nWait, but the code's processing is to choose for each digit (from last to first) the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit, then arrange them in the same order as they were processed (so the new number is the transformed digits in the reverse order of the original digits). \n\nWait, but the code's new number is the transformed digits in the same order as the list, which is the reverse of the original digits. \n\nThus, the new number is the transformed digits arranged in the reverse order of the original digits. \n\nWait, but the code's example: if the original number is 1234, the transformed digits (assuming all digits are chosen as 9 - r if possible):\n\nFor each digit (4,3,2,1):\n\n4 \u2192 9-4=5 (since 5 <4? No, 5>4 \u2192 so choose 4.\n\nWait, 9-4 is 5, which is greater than 4 \u2192 so choose 4. \n\n3 \u2192 9-3=6>3 \u2192 choose 3.\n\n2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 choose 2.\n\n1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 choose 1.\n\nThus, the new number would be 4321, which is the same as the original number reversed. \n\nBut if the digits were chosen as 9 - r when possible, then for example, if the original digit is 5, then 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 so choose 4. \n\nThus, the new number is the transformed digits in the reverse order of the original digits. \n\nThus, in Fortran, after processing each digit (from last to first of the original number), the new digits are stored in an array, and then the new number is built by taking the digits in the order they were processed (so the first digit of the new number is the transformed last digit of the original number). \n\nThus, in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Process each digit of first_result, storing the transformed digits in an array (digits array), in the order of processing (from last to first digit of original number).\n\n- Then, construct the new number by taking each digit in the array and multiplying by 10^power, starting from the first element (which is the transformed last digit of original number) as the first digit of the new number. \n\nThus, the code for the second part would be:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the transformed digits. \n\ncurrent_x = first_result\n\ndigits_count =0\n\ndo while (current_x >0)\n\n    r = mod(current_x,10)\n\n    x_before = current_x\n\n    if (x_before /10 ==0) then \u2192 first digit (original first digit)\n\n        if (9 - r ==0) then \u2192 r is 9 \u2192 can't choose 0, so keep 9.\n\n            new_digit = r\n\n        else \u2192 choose between 9 - r and r.\n\n            if (9 - r < r) then \u2192 choose 9 - r.\n\n                new_digit = 9 - r\n\n            else \u2192 choose r.\n\n                new_digit = r\n\n        end if\n\n    else \u2192 not first digit.\n\n        if (9 - r < r) then \u2192 choose 9 - r.\n\n            new_digit = 9 - r\n\n        else \u2192 choose r.\n\n            new_digit = r\n\n    end if\n\n    digits_count = digits_count +1\n\n    digits(digits_count) = new_digit\n\n    current_x = current_x /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, the new number is built by taking the digits array in order (digits(1) to digits(digits_count)), each multiplied by 10^(digits_count - i), where i is the index. \n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe first element in digits is the transformed last digit of the original number \u2192 this should be the first digit of the new number. \n\nThe second element is the transformed second last digit \u2192 second digit of new number, etc. \n\nThus, the new number is:\n\nnew_number = 0\n\ndo i =1 to digits_count\n\n    new_number = new_number *10 + digits(i)\n\nend do\n\nYes, because each step multiplies the current new_number by 10 and adds the next digit. \n\nFor example, digits = [4,3,2,1], then:\n\ni=1 \u2192 new_number =0*10 +4 \u21924\n\ni=2 \u21924*10 +3 \u219243\n\ni=3 \u219243*10 +2 \u2192432\n\ni=4 \u2192432*10 +1 \u21924321 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, this approach works. \n\nThird part (third Java program):\n\nThe third program takes the new_number (from second step) and counts the number of 1's in its binary representation. \n\nIn Fortran, to do this, we can take the new_number, convert it to binary, and count the 1's. \n\nAlternatively, we can loop through the bits:\n\ncount =0\n\ntemp = new_number\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    if (mod(temp,2) ==1) then \u2192 increment count.\n\n    temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nThus, the final count is the answer. \n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the initial input (position) as a long integer (in Fortran, integer*8 or integer(8) if needed).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the value (position - startIndex) +1).\n\n3. Process that result through the second step to get new_number.\n\n4. Count the 1's in new_number's binary.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (first program's logic):\n\nWe need to compute the first program's result. \n\nThe first program's code:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx =1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position) \u2192 multiply by 2.\n\nThen, while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position \u2192 increment.\n\nThen startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nResult is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nIn Fortran, we can code this as:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(val)\n    integer*8, intent(in) :: index\n    integer*8 :: val\n    val = 1 + (index -1)*index /2\nend function\n\nThen, the main code:\n\ninteger*8 :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result_first\n\nread(*,*) position\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult_first = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part (processing result_first into new_number):\n\nAs discussed earlier, we need to process each digit of result_first, store the transformed digits in an array, then build new_number.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ninteger*8 :: result_first, new_number\ninteger :: digits_count, i\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits\n\ndigits_count =0\n\ncurrent_x = result_first\n\ndo while (current_x >0)\n    r = mod(current_x,10)\n    x_before = current_x\n    if (x_before /10 ==0) then\n        if (9 - r ==0) then\n            new_digit = r\n        else\n            if (9 - r < r) then\n                new_digit =9 -r\n            else\n                new_digit =r\n            end if\n        end if\n    else\n        if (9 - r < r) then\n            new_digit =9 -r\n        else\n            new_digit =r\n        end if\n    end if\n    digits_count = digits_count +1\n    digits(digits_count) = new_digit\n    current_x = current_x /10\nend do\n\nnew_number =0\ndo i=1, digits_count\n    new_number = new_number *10 + digits(i)\nend do\n\nThird part (counting 1's in new_number's binary):\n\ninteger :: count, temp\ncount =0\ntemp = new_number\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n    if (mod(temp,2) ==1) then\n        count = count +1\n    end if\n    temp = temp /2\nend do\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nPutting all together in a single Fortran program:\n\nWe need to make sure all variables are declared properly. Let's structure the code.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, functions can be inside the program, but perhaps better to use a function for getValueAtIndex.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be declared inside the program.

Or is it integer?\n\nWait, result_first is an integer*8 (since it's the result of the first program, which could be large). So current_x must be integer*8.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The variables r, new_digit, x_before are declared as integers (default kind), but current_x is an integer*8. \n\nWait, in the code above, current_x is assigned to x_before, which is an integer. But if current_x is large (e.g., up to 1e18), then x_before (integer) may not be sufficient. \n\nWait, in the second part, the result_first is the output of the first program. Let's see what the first program's output can be. \n\nThe first program's output is (position - startIndex) +1. The position is up to whatever the input is, but the startIndex is the value at the nearest sequence start index. \n\nThe sequence's value at index i is 1 + (i-1)*i/2. \n\nThe maximum possible value for the first program's output would depend on the input, but assuming the input can be up to 1e18, then the result_first could be up to that. \n\nThus, current_x (which is result_first) must be an integer*8. \n\nBut in the code above, x_before is declared as integer (default kind, which may be 4 bytes). So this would cause overflow. \n\nThus, variables r, new_digit, x_before must be integer*8. \n\nWait, but r is mod(current_x,10), which is between 0 and 9, so can be integer. \n\nx_before is current_x, which is integer*8. \n\nThus, x_before must be integer*8. \n\nThus, the variables need to be:\n\n    integer*8 :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result_first, new_number, temp, count, current_x, x_before\n    integer :: digits_count, i, r, new_digit\n    integer, dimension(20) :: digits\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop:\n\ncurrent_x is declared as integer*8, initialized to result_first (integer*8).\n\nx_before is also integer*8.\n\nr is mod(current_x,10) \u2192 which is 0-9 \u2192 can be integer.\n\nnew_digit is also 0-9 \u2192 integer.\n\nThus, the variables:\n\ncurrent_x and x_before are integer*8.\n\nr and new_digit are integers.\n\nThus, the variable declarations should be:\n\n    integer*8 :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result_first, new_number, temp, count, current_x, x_before\n    integer :: digits_count, i, r, new_digit\n    integer, dimension(20) :: digits\n\nNow, the code should handle large numbers.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe full Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    integer*8 :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result_first, new_number, temp, count, current_x, x_before\n    integer :: digits_count, i, r, new_digit\n    integer, dimension(20) :: digits\n\n    !

So choose 3.\n\nThus, new_digit=3.\n\ndigits_count=1 \u2192 digits(1)=3.\n\nnew_number is 3.\n\nThird program: count 1's in binary of 3 (11 \u2192 2 ones).\n\nThus, output is 2.\n\nTesting the Fortran code with input 13 should output 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput to first program: 1.\n\nFirst program's output is 1 (since startIndex is 1, so 1-1+1=1.\n\nSecond program processes 1 \u2192 digits array [1]. \n\nSince it's the first digit (x_before=1 \u2192 x/10=0), and 9-1=8>1 \u2192 choose 1. \n\nnew_number is 1.\n\nThird program: binary 1 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nAnother test case for second program:\n\nInput to second program: 999.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_x=999 \u2192 first iteration:\n\nr=9 \u2192 x_before=999 \u2192 999/10=99.9 \u2192 but in integer division, 999/10 is 99 \u2192 not zero. So not first digit.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. So choose 0.\n\ndigits_count=1 \u2192 digits(1)=0.\n\ncurrent_x becomes 99.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ncurrent_x=99 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 x_before=99 \u2192 99/10=9 \u2192 not first digit.\n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 choose 0 \u2192 digits(2)=0.\n\ncurrent_x=9.\n\nThird iteration:\n\ncurrent_x=9 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 x_before=9 \u2192 9/10=0 \u2192 first digit.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 \u2192 so condition (9 -r ==0) \u2192 yes. So new_digit =9.\n\ndigits_count=3 \u2192 digits(3)=9.\n\nnew_number is 0*100 +0*10 +9 \u2192 9.\n\nWait, no:\n\ndigits array is [0,0,9]. \n\nBuilding new_number:\n\ni=1 \u2192 new_number=0 \u2192 0*10 +0 \u21920.\n\ni=2 \u21920*10 +0 \u21920.\n\ni=3 \u21920*10 +9 \u21929.\n\nThus new_number is 9.\n\nThird program: binary 9 is 1001 \u2192 two 1's \u2192 output 2.\n\nThus, the code should handle this.\n\nAnother test case for the third program:\n\nInput to third program: 0 \u2192 binary 0 \u2192 0 ones \u2192 output 0.\n\nBut the second program's output can't be zero, since the first program's output is at least 1 (since position is at least 1).\n\nWait, first program's position is read as a long, but what if input is 0? Probably invalid, but the code may handle it.\n\nBut according to the first Java code, the first program's solve function reads position as sc.nextLong(). So if input is 0, then the code may crash or not. But the problem likely assumes valid inputs.\n\nOverall, the code should work as intended."
