    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer from input, does some calculations involving sequences, and outputs a result. The second file (codeforces_514_A) takes that output, processes it by modifying its digits, and outputs another number. The third file (codeforces_669_A) takes that number and calculates how many times something happens based on division by 3. The key is that each step's output is the next's input, so the Fortran program must chain these steps without I/O in the middle.\n\nLet me break down each Java program step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\nThe solve() function reads a position from input. It calculates the nearest sequence start index. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. The algorithm uses a loop to find the correct index, then computes the result as (position - startIndex) +1. The main function initializes the scanner and calls solve, then closes the output.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the input once at the start. The first part will compute the first result, store it in a variable, then pass it to the next step.\n\nSecond Java program (codeforces_514_A):\n\nIt reads a long x, then processes each digit. For each digit, if 9 - digit is less than the digit, it uses 9 - digit instead, except when it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero (so leaves it as r). Then it constructs a new number by reversing the digits (since it's collected in reverse order, but the loop starts from the least significant digit first). Wait, actually, the list is built by taking the remainder (x mod 10) each time, so the digits are added in reverse order. Then when building the new number, the first element of the list is the least significant digit. So the code loops through the list, adding each digit multiplied by 10^pow, so the first element (i=0) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), next by 10^1 (tens), etc. So the list is stored in reverse order of the original number's digits, but when building the new number, it's constructed correctly as the digits are added in the order they were stored (so the first digit in the list is the first digit of the new number's least significant digit). Wait, let me think again. Let's see:\n\nOriginal x is, say, 123. Then x mod 10 is 3 (r=3), then x becomes 12. Next r is 2, x becomes 1. Then r is 1, x becomes 0. So the list would have 3,2,1. Then when building newNumber, starting with 0, first iteration adds 3*10^0 \u2192 3. Second adds 2*10^1 \u2192 23. Third adds 1*10^2 \u2192 123. So the new number is 123. Wait, but in this case, the digits weren't changed. But in the code, for each digit, they check if 9 - r is less than r. So for example, if the digit is 5, 9-5 is 4, which is less than 5, so they use 4. So the code is converting each digit to the smaller of the digit or 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero (so leave it as r). Wait, the condition is: if (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) then add r, else add 9 - r. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) list.add(r); else list.add(9 - r);\n\nWait, the first condition is when x divided by 10 is zero, meaning that it's the last digit (since x was divided by 10 each time). So when processing the last digit (the first digit of the original number?), the code checks if 9 - r is zero. If so, then add r instead of 9 - r. So for example, if the last digit is 9, then 9 - r is 0, so we add r (9) instead of 0. Because otherwise, if it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero, then adding 9 - r (0) would make the number have a leading zero, which is not allowed. So this is to prevent leading zeros.\n\nSo the algorithm is: for each digit (starting from the least significant digit), replace it with the minimum between the digit and 9 - digit, except for the first digit (the most significant digit in the original number, which is the last digit processed here) where if 9 - digit is zero, we leave it as the digit.\n\nWait, the code's condition is when x /10 ==0 (so it's the last iteration, since x is divided by 10 each time). So in that case, if 9 - r is zero (i.e., r is 9), then we add r (9) instead of 0. So that the first digit (the most significant digit) doesn't become zero. So the code ensures that the first digit is not zero.\n\nSo the Fortran code for this part needs to take the first result (from the first program's output), process each digit as per this logic, and produce the next number.\n\nThird Java program (codeforces_669_A):\n\nIt reads an integer n, then computes (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0. So the formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod 3 !=0 else 0). Wait, the code says (n /3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1). Let me see:\n\nFor example, n=3 \u2192 3/3=1 \u2192 1*2 +0 \u2192 2.\n\nn=4 \u2192 4/3 is 1, mod 1 \u2192 1*2 +1 \u21923.\n\nWait, the code's formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod !=0 else 0). So the total is the number of full groups of 3, each contributing 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder.\n\nSo the third program takes the second's output (which is a long, but in the third program it's read as an integer. Wait, but in the second program, the output is a long, but the third program reads it as an integer. Hmm, but in the Java code for the third program, the input is read as an integer. So perhaps the second program's output is within the integer range. So in Fortran, I need to read it as an integer.\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain all three steps in a single Fortran program. The first step reads the input, processes it to get the first result, then passes that to the second step (without I/O), then the second step's result is passed to the third step, and finally the third step's result is printed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (from the user) into a variable (the first program's input is a long, so in Fortran, use integer*8 or similar).\n\n2. Compute the first result (the first program's output).\n\n3. Take that result, process it through the second program's logic (digit manipulation), resulting in the second number.\n\n4. Take that second number, process it through the third program's logic (compute (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod 3 !=0 else 0)), then output the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about each part's implementation in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_622_A):\n\nThe first program's solve function:\n\nThe position is read as a long. The code finds the nearest sequence start index. The sequence is such that the value at index i is 1 + (i-1)*i/2. The algorithm uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 where the value is less than position, then increments until the next value exceeds.\n\nLet me see the code again:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n\n}\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nlong startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo the first step is to compute this result.\n\nIn Fortran, variables can be integers*8 (since Java uses long, which is 64 bits). So in Fortran, we can use integer(8) variables.\n\nImplementing the first part:\n\nRead position as an integer(8).\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1.\n\nLoop while getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position: multiply by 2.\n\nThen, loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position: increment nrstSeqStartIndx by 1.\n\nThen compute startIndex = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx*(nrstSeqStartIndx-1))/2 ?\n\nWait, getValueAtIndex is 1 + (index-1)*index/2. So for index = nrstSeqStartIndx, it's 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx-1)*nrstSeqStartIndx /2.\n\nWait, the formula is (index-1)*index /2 +1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n\ninteger(8) :: index, res\n\nres = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\n\nend function\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part can be written with loops.\n\nSecond part (codeforces_514_A):\n\nThe second program takes the first result (a long) and processes each digit.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nInitialize a list (in Fortran, perhaps an array or a stack). Let's think of it as an array.\n\nInitialize x as the first result (the first program's output).\n\nLoop while x >0:\n\nr = mod(x,10)\n\nx = x /10\n\nThen, decide whether to use r or 9 - r.\n\nBut with the condition: if this is the last digit (i.e., when x becomes 0 after division), then check if 9 - r is zero. If so, use r instead of 9 - r.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the condition is:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 but wait, in the code, after getting r, x is divided by 10. Wait, the code is:\n\nlong r = x %10;\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 but x is before division. Wait, the code is:\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nx is the original number. The code does:\n\nwhile (x>0) {\n\nr = x%10;\n\nif (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\nThen x = x/10.\n\nWait, so the condition is checking whether the current digit is the last one (since after division by 10, x becomes 0). So when x is divided by 10, if the result is 0, then this was the last digit. So the condition is (x /10 ==0) \u2192 but before dividing x by 10. Wait, the code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx is the current value. So when x is, say, 123, then x/10 is 12 (integer division). So the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. Then, after processing, x becomes 12. Next iteration, x is 12 \u2192 x/10 is 1 \u2192 not zero. Then x becomes 1. Next iteration, x is 1 \u2192 x/10 is 0 \u2192 so the condition is true. So in that case, if 9 - r (r is 1) is 8, which is not zero, so the condition (9 -r ==0) is false. So the code would add 9 -1 =8. Wait, but in that case, the last digit (the original first digit) would be 8, making the number 82 (if previous digits were 2 and 3?), but perhaps I need to think through an example.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say the first program's output is 123.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx is 123 \u2192 r = 3. x/10 is 12 \u2192 not zero. So condition is false. So add 9-3=6 (since 6 <3? Wait, 9-3 is 6, which is not less than 3. Wait, the condition in the code is: if (9 - r < r) \u2192 then use 9 -r, else use r. Wait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0 \u2192 then add r else add 9 -r.\n\nWait, the code's first condition is \"if (9 - r < r)\" \u2192 then:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0 \u2192 add r else add 9 -r.\n\nWait, no, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 add r else add 9 -r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n    else list.add(9 - r);\n\n} else {\n\n    list.add(r);\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is written as:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 add r else add 9 -r.\n\n} else {\n\n    add r.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code's first condition is whether 9 - r is less than r. If yes, then check if it's the last digit (x/10 ==0) and whether 9 -r is zero. If both, then add r, else add 9 -r. Else, add r.\n\nWait, the code's first condition is \"if (9 - r < r)\" \u2192 so when that's true, we consider using 9 -r. But then, in the case where it's the last digit and 9 -r is zero (so 9 -r ==0 \u2192 r is 9), then we add r (9) instead of 0, to prevent leading zero.\n\nSo for example, if the digit is 9 and it's the last digit, then 9 -9 is 0, so 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes. Then, since it's the last digit (x/10 is 0), and 9 -r is 0 \u2192 so we add r (9) instead of 0.\n\nAnother example: digit is 5. 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 so use 4. Since it's not the last digit, add 4.\n\nIf the digit is 0, then 9-0=9 which is larger than 0 \u2192 so we use 0.\n\nWait, 9-0 is 9, which is not less than 0 \u2192 so the first condition (9 -r < r) is false (since 9 <0 is false). So we add r (0).\n\nWait, but 0 is better than 9? Because the code chooses the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit. So for 0, 0 is smaller than 9, so yes, keep 0.\n\nSo the code's logic is to choose the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero (so digit is 9), in which case we keep 9 instead of 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to process each digit of the first result (the first program's output) as follows:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the digits (since we process from least to most significant, but need to build the number in reverse order).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits are collected in the list in the order of least significant to most (since we process x mod 10 each time, then divide x by 10). So the first element in the list is the least significant digit, the next is the next, etc. Then when building the new number, each digit is multiplied by 10^power, so the first element (LSB) is multiplied by 1, then next by 10, etc. So the digits are in the correct order for the new number.\n\nWait, the list is built as follows:\n\nFor x = 123:\n\nFirst iteration: r =3 \u2192 added to list \u2192 list is [3]\n\nx becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: r=2 \u2192 added \u2192 list [3,2]\n\nx becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration: r=1 \u2192 added \u2192 list [3,2,1]\n\nx becomes 0 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThen, when building newNumber:\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nFirst element (3) \u2192 3 *10^0 \u2192 3.\n\nSecond (2) \u2192 2*10^1 \u2192 23.\n\nThird (1) \u2192 1*10^2 \u2192 123.\n\nSo the new number is 123. But in this case, the digits weren't changed. Let's take another example where digits are changed.\n\nSuppose the first result is 19 \u2192 digits are 9 and 1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst iteration (x=19):\n\nr =9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. Check if x/10 (19/10=1) is not zero \u2192 so add 0 (since 9-9=0, but since it's not the last digit (x/10 is 1), so add 0. Then x becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration (x=1):\n\nr=1 \u2192 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 so add 1. Now, since x/10 is 0 (after division, x becomes 0), so it's the last digit. So the list is [0,1].\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, first iteration:\n\nx is 19 \u2192 r=9. x/10 is 1 (since 19/10 is 1.9 \u2192 integer division gives 1). So the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. So since 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes, so add 9-9=0. Then x becomes 19//10 =1.\n\nSecond iteration: x is 1 \u2192 r=1. 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 so add 1. Now, check if x/10 is 0 (since x is 1, x/10 is 0). So the condition (x/10 ==0) is true. But 9 - r (9-1=8) is not zero. So the code adds 1 (since the else clause of the first condition is taken). Wait, no, the first condition is 9 - r < r \u2192 8 <1? No. So the else clause is taken, so add r (1). So the list is [0,1].\n\nThen, building the new number:\n\npow starts at 0.\n\nFirst element (0) \u2192 0 *1 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond element (1) \u2192 1*10 \u2192 10. Total is 10.\n\nSo the new number is 10. Which is correct because 19 \u2192 digits 9 and 1. The first digit (9) is the last digit (since it's the first digit of the original number). Wait, in the original number 19, the last digit is 9 (the first digit processed here). So when processing the 9, it's not the last digit (since x/10 is 1, so not zero). So the code uses 0. The next digit (1) is the first digit of the original number (the most significant digit). Since it's the last digit (x/10 is 0 after division), but 9 -1 is 8, which is not zero, so it's okay to add 1. So the new number is 10, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: original number is 9 \u2192 digits are 9.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx=9 \u2192 r=9. x/10 is 0 \u2192 so the condition (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0 \u2192 yes (since 9-9=0). So add r (9). Then x becomes 0.\n\nThe list is [9]. Then newNumber is 9 \u2192 correct, because otherwise it would be 0, which is a leading zero.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to process each digit of the first result (the first program's output) as follows:\n\nInitialize an array (or a list) to hold the digits. Let's use an array of integers, since each digit is 0-9.\n\nWe can loop through the digits by repeatedly taking mod 10 and dividing by 10.\n\nWe can track the digits in an array, starting from the first element as the least significant digit.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps:\n\nInitialize an array of size, say, 20 (since the first program's output could be up to very large, but in practice, the first program's output is (position - startIndex) +1, which for very large position could be big, but in codeforces problems, maybe manageable).\n\nAlternatively, we can process the digits and build the new number on the fly without an array, but that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's process each digit step by step, building the new number as we go.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nInitialize newNumber as 0.\n\nWe can process each digit from the least significant to most, but when building the new number, each digit is added to the left (i.e., multiplied by 10 each time).\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the digits are stored in an array as [d1, d2, d3], where d1 is the least significant digit (original number's last digit). The new number should be d3 d2 d1 \u2192 but each digit is transformed.\n\nWait, no, the new number is built by taking the transformed digits in the order they were processed (since the first digit processed is the least significant, and the new number is built by adding each digit multiplied by 10^power, so the first digit is the least significant in the new number. So the digits are in the correct order.\n\nWait, the code in Java builds the new number by adding each digit in the order they were stored in the list (which is least to most), so the first digit (d1) is the least significant in the new number. So the new number is d1 + d2*10 + d3*100 etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can process each digit, decide the transformed digit, and build the new number step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize newNumber as 0.\n\nInitialize a variable to track whether we are at the last digit (the first digit of the original number). Wait, but how do we know when we are at the last digit?\n\nAlternatively, process all digits first, storing them in an array, then process the array to build the new number.\n\nLet me try the array approach.\n\nLet's say the first result is stored in variable first_result (integer(8)).\n\nInitialize an array digits of size, say, 20 (since 2^63 is a huge number, but in practice, the first program's output is (position - startIndex) +1, which for very large position could be big, but even 1e18 has 18 digits, so 20 is enough).\n\nInitialize an index counter, say, count =0.\n\nLoop while first_result >0:\n\ndigit = mod(first_result,10)\n\nfirst_result = first_result /10\n\ncount = count +1\n\ndigits(count) = digit\n\nSo after this loop, digits(1) is the least significant digit, digits(count) is the most significant (the first digit of the original number).\n\nThen, process each digit in the array, starting from 1 to count.\n\nWait, but when building the new number, we need to process the digits in the same order as the Java code (i.e., the first digit processed is the least significant, so the first element in the array is first, then next, etc.), but when building the new number, each digit is added to the right (i.e., multiplied by 10^power).\n\nWait, the new number is built as:\n\nnewNumber = 0\n\npow =0\n\ndo i=1 to count:\n\n    digit = transformed digit for digits(i)\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + digit * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nSo the first digit (digits(1)) is the least significant in the new number.\n\nNow, the transformation for each digit:\n\nFor each digit (digits(i)), which is the original digit (since we stored mod 10):\n\nWait, the original digit is digits(i). Let me call it r.\n\nWait, the original digit is r = digits(i).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the processing is done as follows:\n\nfor each digit (starting from the least significant):\n\nr = original digit (digits(i))\n\nif (9 - r < r):\n\n    if (this is the last digit (i.e., the current digit is the most significant digit of the original number, which is the last one processed in the array (i=count)) and (9 - r ==0)):\n\n        use r\n\n    else:\n\n        use 9 - r\n\nelse:\n\n    use r\n\nWait, the condition for the last digit is when it's the most significant digit (i=count). Because in the Java code, the last digit processed (the first digit of the original number) is the one where x/10 becomes zero.\n\nSo in the array, the first element is the least significant digit (original's last digit), and the count-th element is the most significant (original's first digit).\n\nSo for each digit in the array (from i=1 to count):\n\nr = digits(i)\n\nif (i == count) \u2192 it's the most significant digit (the last digit processed in the original loop).\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nif (9 - r < r):\n\n    if (i == count .and. (9 - r ==0)) \u2192 then use r\n\n    else \u2192 use 9 - r\n\nelse \u2192 use r\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i =1 to count:\n\n    r = digits(i)\n\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n\n        if (i == count .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n            transformed = r\n\n        else\n\n            transformed = 9 - r\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        transformed = r\n\n    end if\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + transformed * 10**(pow)\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nWait, but pow starts at 0, so first term is 10^0, etc.\n\nWait, the first iteration (i=1) is the least significant digit, so multiplied by 10^0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so that's okay.\n\nNow, handling the digits array:\n\nWe can pre-allocate an array of size, say, 20. Then, after processing, count will be the number of digits.\n\nNow, the third part (codeforces_669_A):\n\nThe third program takes the second's output (the newNumber from the second step) and computes (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we have to be careful with negative numbers, but since the input is a number from the second step, which is non-negative (since it's a digit transformation of a positive number), so n is non-negative.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nresult = (n /3) *2 + (mod(n,3) ==0 ? 0 :1)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn mod3 can be 0,1,2.\n\nIf mod is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total is (n/3)*2.\n\nIf mod is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 (n/3)*2 +1.\n\nIf mod is 2 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 (n/3)*2 +1.\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\n(n /3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0 :1)\n\nSo for mod 1 or 2, it adds 1.\n\nYes, so the formula is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, mod(n,3) gives the remainder. So:\n\nthird_result = (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3) /=0 )\n\nAlternatively:\n\nthird_result = (n /3)*2 + (mod(n,3) .ne.0 )\n\nBecause in Fortran, logical expressions evaluate to 1 (true) or 0 (false).\n\nWait, in Fortran, if you have an expression like (mod(n,3) .ne.0), it is 1 if true, 0 otherwise. So adding that to the first term gives exactly the desired result.\n\nSo third_result = (n /3)*2 + (mod(n,3) .ne.0 )\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the initial input (position) as an integer(8).\n\n2. Compute the first result (first_result) using the first program's logic.\n\n3. Process first_result through the second program's digit transformation to get second_result.\n\n4. Compute third_result using the third program's formula.\n\n5. Print third_result.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part (first_result):\n\nWe need to implement the loops from the first Java program.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, first_result\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nfirst_result = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nBut we need a function for getValueAtIndex.\n\nFunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n    integer(8) :: res\n\n    res = 1 + (index-1)*index /2\n\nend function\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since index is integer(8), the multiplication and division should be okay.\n\nNow, the second part (second_result):\n\nWe need to process first_result into second_result.\n\nFirst, get the digits into an array.\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_digits =20\n\ninteger :: digits(max_digits), count=0, i, r, transformed, newNumber=0, pow=0\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ncount =0\n\ninteger(8) :: temp = first_result\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    count = count +1\n\n    digits(count) = mod(temp,10)\n\n    temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nNow, process each digit:\n\ndo i=1, count\n\n    r = digits(i)\n\n    if (9 - r < r) then\n\n        if (i == count .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n            transformed = r\n\n        else\n\n            transformed =9 -r\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        transformed =r\n\n    end if\n\n    newNumber = newNumber + transformed * 10**pow\n\n    pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is **. So 10**pow is okay.\n\nWait, but 10**pow can get large. Since newNumber is an integer, but the digits are up to 9, and count is up to 20, so 10^19 is manageable as an integer? Well, in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Since the second program's output is a number that the third program reads as an integer (Java's int is 32 bits). So the maximum possible second_result is when the first_result is up to 1e18 (but after processing, the digits are transformed, but the number can't be larger than the original. Wait, actually, the transformation can increase the number. For example, if a digit is 0, it becomes 9 (since 9-0=9 which is larger than 0, so the code chooses 0. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, for a digit 0:\n\n9 -0 =9, which is greater than 0 \u2192 so the first condition (9 -r < r) is 9 <0 \u2192 false. So the else clause is taken, so transformed is r (0). So 0 stays as 0.\n\nWait, so the maximum digit after transformation is 9 (for example, digit 9 becomes 0 (if not last digit), but if it's the last digit, it stays 9.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the original digit is 5 \u2192 transformed to 4 (since 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 yes. So 4.\n\nIf the digit is 4 \u2192 9-4=5>4 \u2192 so choose 4.\n\nWait, 9-4 is 5 which is greater than 4 \u2192 so the condition (9 -r <r) is 5 <4 \u2192 no \u2192 so use r (4).\n\nSo the maximum digit after transformation is 9 (for digits 0, which stays 0, but 9 as the last digit).\n\nWait, the maximum possible digit is 9 (for example, the last digit being 9 \u2192 transformed to 9.\n\nSo the new number can be up to 999...999 (count digits). For count=20, that's 1e20, which is larger than 2^31 (Java's int is up to 2e9). So in the third program, which reads it as an integer, this could be a problem. But perhaps in the problem constraints, the first program's output is such that after processing, the second_result is within integer range.\n\nAssuming that, in Fortran, we can use integer variables for newNumber (since in the third step, it's passed as an integer to the third function).\n\nWait, but in the code above, newNumber is declared as integer. But if first_result is up to 1e18, then after processing, the newNumber could be up to 1e20, which is larger than 2^31 (which is about 2e9). So in Fortran, we need to use integer(8) for newNumber to handle large numbers. But the third program expects an integer (Java's int is 32 bits). Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe second program's output is a long (since it's stored in newNumber as a long). The third program reads it as an integer. So the second program's output must be within the integer range (i.e., between -2^31 and 2^31-1). So the problem constraints must ensure that the first program's output is such that after processing, the second_result is within that range.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can use integer variables for newNumber (since it's within 32 bits). So the code can proceed with integer variables.\n\nWait, but in the code above, first_result is an integer(8), but when we process it into digits, the digits are stored as integers (since mod and division are done with integer(8) temp, but the digits are 0-9, so integer is okay).\n\nSo the code for the second part can be written with integers.\n\nNow, the third part is straightforward.\n\nNow, putting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nThe program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: position, first_result\n\n    integer :: second_result, third_result\n\n    !

The temp variable is integer(8) to handle the first_val (which is up to 1e18, but when divided by 10 each time, it's okay).\n\nWait, but in the loop for temp:\n\ntemp is first_val (integer(8)), so mod(temp,10) is okay, since mod is applied to integer(8). The digits are stored as integers (0-9), so that's okay.\n\nThe newNumber is an integer, but if first_val is up to 1e18, then after processing, the newNumber could be up to 9999999999999999999 (19 9's) which is 1e19, which is larger than 2^31 (about 2e9). So this would overflow an integer (assuming 32-bit integers). So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, so the second function's result must be an integer that can fit into a 32-bit integer. So perhaps the problem constraints ensure that first_val is such that after processing, the second_result is within 32 bits. But in the code, to be safe, perhaps compute_second should return an integer(8), and then compute_third can take an integer(8) and cast to integer?\n\nWait, the third Java program reads it as an integer, so the second_result must be within the integer range. So in Fortran, compute_second should return an integer (assuming 32-bit), but if the first_val is such that the second_result exceeds that, it would be a problem. But given the problem's context, perhaps it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, compute_second can return an integer(8), and compute_third can take an integer(8) and compute the result as an integer.\n\nWait, the third function's formula is (n/3)*2 + (mod(n,3)/=0). If n is up to 2e9, then (n/3)*2 is up to ~1.3e9, plus 1 \u2192 still within 32 bits.\n\nSo in Fortran, compute_second can return an integer(8), and compute_third can take an integer(8) and return an integer.\n\nWait, but in the code above, compute_second returns an integer (newNumber is integer). So if first_val is large, this could overflow.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to make newNumber an integer(8) in compute_second.\n\nLet me adjust compute_second:\n\nfunction compute_second(first_val) result(res)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: first_val\n\n    integer(8) :: res, temp = first_val\n\n    integer :: digits(20), count=0, i, r, transformed\n\n    integer :: pow=0\n\n    integer(8) :: newNumber=0\n\n    count =0\n\n    do while (temp >0)\n\n        count = count +1\n\n        digits(count) = mod(temp,10)\n\n        temp = temp /10\n\n    end do\n\n    newNumber =0\n\n    pow =0\n\n    do i=1, count\n\n        r = digits(i)\n\n        if (9 - r < r) then\n\n            if (i == count .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n                transformed = r\n\n            else\n\n                transformed =9 -r\n\n            end if\n\n        else\n\n            transformed =r\n\n        end if\n\n        newNumber = newNumber + transformed * 10**pow\n\n        pow = pow +1\n\n    end do\n\n    res = newNumber\n\nend function\n\nNow, newNumber is integer(8), so res is integer(8). Then compute_third can take an integer(8) n:\n\nfunction compute_third(n) result(res)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: n\n\n    integer :: res\n\n    res = (n /3)*2 + (mod(n,3) /=0 )\n\nend function\n\nBut in this case, if n is larger than 2^31-1, then (n/3)*2 could be larger than 2^31-1, but the third Java program reads it as an integer, so the problem must ensure that the second_result is within integer range. So assuming that, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final Fortran program would look like this.\n\nWait, also, in the first function compute_first, the loops may have to handle very large numbers. But since in Java, the code uses long, which is 64 bits, and Fortran's integer(8) is 64 bits, it should be okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the first loop of compute_first:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < pos)\n\nThis could loop until nrstSeqStartIndx becomes very large, but since it's doubling each time, it should terminate quickly even for large pos.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nLet me test with an example.\n\nSuppose the input is 3 (position=3).\n\nFirst program's solve:\n\nposition=3.\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 1 + (2-1)*2/2 =1+1=2 <3 \u2192 so multiply by 2 \u2192 2.\n\nNow check getValueAtIndex(4) \u2192 1 +3*4/2 =1+6=7 >3 \u2192 so exit first loop.\n\nNow, second loop: check getValueAtIndex(2+1)=getValueAtIndex(3) \u2192 1 +2*3/2 =1+3=4. 4 <=3? No \u2192 so loop doesn't run.\n\nstartIndex is getValueAtIndex(2) \u2192 2. So first_result =3-2 +1 =2.\n\nSecond program processes 2 \u2192 digits are [2].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (count=1, so i==count).\n\nr=2.\n\n9-2=7 <2? No \u2192 so transformed is 2.\n\nnewNumber is 2 \u2192 second_result=2.\n\nThird program: 2/3 is 0 \u2192 0*2 + (mod(2,3)/=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the third program's code:\n\nsolve(2) \u2192 (2/3)*2 + (2%3 !=0 \u21921 \u2192 total 1.\n\nYes. So the output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 6.\n\nFirst program:\n\nposition=6.\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue is 2 \u2192 2 <6 \u2192 yes. Multiply by 2 \u2192 2.\n\nCheck 2*2=4 \u2192 getValue is 1+3*4/2=7 \u2192 7 <6? No \u2192 so first loop stops.\n\nNow, second loop: check nrstSeqStartIndx=2 \u2192 check 3 \u2192 getValue(3)=4 \u2192 4 <=6 \u2192 yes \u2192 increment to 3.\n\nCheck getValue(4)=7 \u2192 7>6 \u2192 stop.\n\nSo nrstSeqStartIndx is 3.\n\nstartIndex is getValue(3)=4.\n\nfirst_result =6-4 +1 =3.\n\nSecond program processes 3 \u2192 digits [3].\n\ni=1 (count=1 \u2192 i==count).\n\nr=3 \u2192 9-3=6 <3? No \u2192 so transformed is 3.\n\nnewNumber is 3 \u2192 second_result=3.\n\nThird program: 3/3=1 \u2192 1*2 +0 \u21922.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nAnother test case for second program:\n\nSuppose first_result is 19 \u2192 second program's output is 10.\n\nThen third program: 10 \u2192 10/3=3 \u2192 3*2=6 +1 (since mod 1 \u2192 total 7.\n\nSo third_result is 7.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should be as written above."
