So better to make a copy.

Wait, the Java code for the second approach (a2) is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, right! So in the second approach, when a duplicate is found at position i and i-1, the code changes the (i-1)th character, not the ith. So the loop is from the end backwards, and when a duplicate is found between i and i-1, the (i-1)th is changed. So in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop from i = len_trim(x_copy_b)",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is that the first program reads input, the last outputs, and the middle ones process without I/O. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose.\n\nFirst Java file (ABC105_D): It reads n, m, and an array a. Then it does some calculations with a HashMap, updating base and ans. The output is ans. The main logic is in the solve method of TaskD.\n\nSecond Java file (ABC124_C): Takes a string x, modifies it in two ways (forward and backward), counts the changes needed to make consecutive characters different, then outputs the minimum of the two counts. The solve method here processes the string and calculates a1 and a2.\n\nThird Java file (codeforces_276_B): Reads a string, counts character frequencies. If the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1, first wins; else, if even, second. Outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain these three processes in Fortran. The input comes from the first program, then each subsequent step uses the output of the previous. But in Fortran, I need to do this in a single program without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nWait, the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first part reads input, then passes data to the second, which processes and passes to the third, which outputs. But how to structure this in Fortran?\n\nLet me think of the data flow:\n\n1. The first Java program (ABC105_D) reads n, m, a array. Then computes ans. But the next program (ABC124_C) needs a string x. Wait, but the second Java program's input is a string. Wait, the original sequence is three Java programs executed in sequence, where each's output is the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output is a number (ans), which is then the input to the second program (which expects a string x). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the user says the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, with each output used as the next's input. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program (ABC105_D) outputs a number (ans). The second program (ABC124_C) expects a string x as input. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string. That would require that the first program's output is a string, but in the first Java code, the output is a single integer. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the three Java programs are part of a sequence where each's output is the next's input, but the actual data flow is different?\n\nWait, perhaps the three Java programs are separate, but when run in sequence, their outputs are connected. For example, the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output must be the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first program outputs a number. That would mean that the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program, which expects a string. That would require that the first program's output is a string, but in the first Java code, the output is a single integer. Hmm, maybe I need to check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's solve method: it outputs ans, which is a long. So the first program's output is a single integer. The second program's input is a string x. So the first program's output (the integer) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. That would mean that the second program is expecting a string, but the first program's output is a number. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the three Java programs are not connected in a chain? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. Let me check each program's input and output.\n\nFirst program (ABC105_D):\n\nInput: Reads n, m, then an array a of n integers.\n\nOutput: A single integer (ans).\n\nSecond program (ABC124_C):\n\nInput: A string x (from the first program's output? But the first outputs a number. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the three Java programs are not connected in a chain, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and chain them in a single program. Wait, the user says \"the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". So the three Java programs are run in sequence, with each's output as next's input. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input. So the first program's output must be the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first program outputs a number. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's an integer. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string? Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's solve method: out.println(ans); where ans is a long. So the output is a single integer. The second program's input is a string x, which is read via in.next(). So the second program expects a string as input, but the first program's output is a number. That would mean that the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the second program, which reads it as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program reads that as the string \"5\".\n\nWait, that's possible. So the first program's output is a number, which is the input to the second program as a string. The second program then processes that string (e.g., if the first outputs 123, the second's x is \"123\"). Then the second program's output is the minimum of a1 and a2, which is a number. Then the third program takes that number as input, but the third program expects a string. Wait, the third program's input is a string (from the second's output, which is a number). So the third program would read that number as a string. For example, if the second outputs 4, then the third's input is \"4\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code reads a string from input, which is the entire line. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a number. So the third program would read that number as a string, then process it as per its logic.\n\nSo the data flow is:\n\nFirst program's output (integer) \u2192 second program's input (string x).\n\nSecond program's output (integer) \u2192 third program's input (string str).\n\nThird program processes that string (the number as a string) and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is:\n\nInput \u2192 first program \u2192 output integer \u2192 second program (input is that integer as a string) \u2192 output integer \u2192 third program (input is that integer as a string) \u2192 output \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, the last writing output, and the middle steps processing without I/O.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, m, array a).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans).\n\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's processing (treating it as a string x).\n\n4. Compute the second program's result (min(a1,a2)).\n\n5. Use that result as the input to the third program's processing (as a string str).\n\n6. Compute the third program's result (\"First\" or \"Second\") and output it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first program's input (n, m, a array).\n\n- Compute the first's ans.\n\n- Convert ans to a string (x) for the second step.\n\n- Process the second step (compute min(a1,a2) based on x).\n\n- Convert that result to a string (str) for the third step.\n\n- Process the third step (determine \"First\" or \"Second\" based on str).\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst step (ABC105_D):\n\nVariables needed: n, m, array a (size n), base (integer), ans (integer), and a hash map. Wait, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map. Hmm, that's a problem. The first Java program uses a HashMap to track counts. How to handle that in Fortran?\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nThe loop for each element in a:\n\nbase is updated as (base - a[i]%m + m) mod m.\n\nThen, the dp map is merged with (base + a[i]) mod m, adding 1. The ans is increased by the count of base in the map.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor each a[i] in a:\n\nbase = (base - a[i]%m + m) % m\n\nthen, dp.merge( (base + a[i])%m, 1, Integer::sum )\n\nans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0)\n\nWait, perhaps the dp is a frequency map of some value. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nInitially, dp is empty. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nbase is updated as (base - (a[i] mod m) + m) mod m. Wait, but a[i]%m can be negative? Wait in Java, mod can be negative if the number is negative, but since a is an array of integers, but the problem might assume they are non-negative. Assuming a[i] is non-negative, then a[i]%m is between 0 and m-1. So (base - (a[i]%m) + m) mod m is equivalent to (base - a[i]%m) mod m, but adding m to ensure it's positive before mod.\n\nWait, perhaps the base is being updated as (base - a[i] mod m) mod m. But the code is written as (base - a[i]%m + m) % m, which is the same as (base - (a[i]%m)) mod m, but ensuring that the subtraction doesn't go negative before mod.\n\nWait, perhaps the base is being updated as (base - (a[i] mod m)) mod m. So each step, subtract a[i] mod m from base, mod m.\n\nThen, the next part is adding to the dp map the value (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, the code is:\n\ndp.merge( (base + a[i])%m, 1, Integer::sum )\n\nSo for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, we add 1 to its count. The merge function here is adding 1 to the existing value, or setting to 1 if not present.\n\nThen, ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). Wait, but base here is the current base before processing this a[i]? Or after?\n\nWait, the order is:\n\nbase is updated first, then the merge is done with (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nbase = (base - a[i]%m + m) % m\n\nthen, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but base has just been updated. So the key is (new base + a[i]) mod m?\n\nWait, let me re-express the code step by step for each iteration:\n\nInitially, base is 0.\n\nFor each a[i]:\n\n1. Compute the current a[i] mod m (let's call it rem).\n\n2. Update base: base = (base - rem + m) mod m.\n\n3. Compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\n4. Update the dp map for key by adding 1 (merge with 1, summing).\n\n5. ans += the count of base in the dp map (before this iteration's changes? Or after?)\n\nWait, the dp.getOrDefault(base, 0) is the count before this iteration's merge? Because the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is different from the current base.\n\nWait, the ans is increased by the current count of base in the dp map. But the dp map is being updated for a different key (the key is (base + a[i]) mod m). So the count of base in the dp map is the count from previous steps.\n\nWait, the order is:\n\nAfter updating base, we add to the dp map the key (base + a[i]) mod m. Then, we add to ans the current count of base in the dp map (before this iteration's merge? Or after?).\n\nWait, the code is:\n\ndp.merge( key, 1, Integer::sum )\n\nThis adds 1 to the count of key in the map. Then, ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0).\n\nWait, the getOrDefault is for the current base (the new base after the update), but the key being added is (base + a[i]) mod m. So the count of base in the dp map is whatever it was before this iteration's merge. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nWait, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. So the merge is adding to that key's count, not the base's count. So the ans is adding the count of base in the dp map before this iteration's merge.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value after the first step. So the count of base in the dp map is whatever was stored before this iteration. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose base was 0 before processing a[i]. Then after step 1 and 2, base becomes new_base. Then, the key is (new_base + a[i]) mod m. The merge adds 1 to that key's count. Then, ans += the count of new_base in the dp map (before this iteration's merge? Or after?).\n\nWait, the getOrDefault is for the current base (new_base). The merge is for a different key. So the count of new_base in the dp map is whatever it was before this iteration. Because the merge is for the key (new_base + a[i]) mod m, which may or may not be new_base.\n\nTherefore, the ans is accumulating the count of the current base (new_base) in the dp map before this iteration's merge. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nWait, but the dp map is being updated for the key (new_base + a[i]) mod m. So the count of new_base in the dp map is not affected by this merge. So the ans is adding the current count of new_base in the dp map (before this iteration's merge), then the merge adds to another key.\n\nWait, but the initial state of the dp map is empty. Let's walk through an example.\n\nSuppose n=1, m=2, a[0]=1.\n\nInitial base is 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nrem = 1 mod 2 =1.\n\nbase becomes (0 -1 +2) mod 2 \u2192 (1) mod2 \u21921.\n\nkey is (1 +1) mod2 \u21922 mod2=0.\n\nSo merge key 0 with 1. So dp now has {0:1}.\n\nThen ans += dp.get(1) \u2192 which is 0 (since 1 is not in the map yet). So ans remains 0.\n\nWait, but the first step's ans is 0?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the code logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is intended to track the number of times a certain value has been seen before, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the code again.\n\nThe code's purpose is to compute the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j such that (a_0 + ... + a_i) mod m = (a_j + ... + a_{n-1}) mod m. Or something like that. The problem is from AtCoder, so maybe it's problem D from ABC105, which is \"Traveling in Time\". The problem requires counting the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the sum from a_i to a_j is divisible by m. The code's approach uses a prefix sum approach with some modulo arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a clever way to track the required counts. The key part is the dp map, which tracks the frequency of certain values. The exact logic might be complex, but in Fortran, since we can't use a hash map, we need to find an array-based approach.\n\nThe maximum possible value for the key in the dp map is m-1, since it's mod m. So the keys are in 0..m-1. Therefore, instead of a hash map, we can use an array of size m, where each index represents the key, and the value is the count.\n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. Since the keys are modulo m, the possible keys are 0 to m-1. So instead of a HashMap, we can use an array of integers of size m, initialized to 0. This will be much more efficient and manageable in Fortran.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the first part:\n\nWe can have an array dp(0:m-1), initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for each step:\n\nbase is updated as (base - a(i) mod m + m) mod m.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, mod(a, m) gives a result with the same sign as m. Since m is positive, mod(a(i), m) will be between 0 and m-1. So a(i) mod m is okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the modulo function is mod(a, m). So rem = mod(a(i), m).\n\nThen, base = mod(base - rem + m, m). Because (base - rem) could be negative, so adding m before mod ensures it's positive.\n\nThen, the key is mod(base + a(i), m). Wait, no, the code says (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, the code's key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but base is already mod m, and a[i] mod m is rem. So base + a[i] mod m would be (base + rem) mod m? Or is it (base + a[i]) mod m?\n\nWait, the code uses (base + a[i]) mod m. Since a[i] can be larger than m, but base is mod m. So (base + a[i]) mod m is equivalent to (base + rem) mod m, where rem is a[i] mod m. But perhaps it's better to compute it directly as mod(base + a(i), m).\n\nThen, we need to increment dp(key) by 1. So dp(key) = dp(key) + 1.\n\nThen, ans += dp(base). Wait, because the current base is the value we are checking. Wait, the code says ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). But in the array approach, dp(base) is the count of how many times base has been seen before. Wait, perhaps the logic is that the current base is the value that we are now adding to the dp array for the next steps, but the ans is counting the number of previous occurrences of the current base.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code with the array approach:\n\nInitialize dp array to all 0. Also, initially, before any elements are processed, there's a base of 0. So perhaps we need to account for the initial state.\n\nWait, in the original code, before the loop starts, base is 0. Then, for each a[i], the first step is to update base. Then, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but after updating base, the key is (new base + a[i]) mod m?\n\nWait, let me re-express the code steps with the array:\n\nInitialize dp as array of size m, all 0.\n\nbase = 0\n\nans = 0\n\ndp( (base + a[0]) mod m ) += 1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the code's logic with the array.\n\nWait, the original code's loop:\n\nfor each a[i] in a:\n\n    rem = a[i] % m\n\n    base = (base - rem + m) % m\n\n    key = (base + a[i]) % m\n\n    dp.put(key, dp.get(key,0)+1)\n\n    ans += dp.get(base,0)\n\nWait, but the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but base is the new base after the subtraction. So the key is (new_base + a[i]) mod m?\n\nWait, the code's key is (base + a[i]) mod m, where base has been updated to new_base. So the key is (new_base + a[i]) mod m.\n\nWait, but the code's merge is for that key, adding 1. So the dp array's entry for that key is incremented.\n\nThen, ans += the current count of base (the new_base) in the dp array before this iteration's merge? Or after?\n\nWait, the ans += dp.get(base, 0) is after the merge? Or before?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe order is:\n\n1. Update base.\n\n2. Compute key and merge into dp (i.e., increment dp[key] by 1).\n\n3. Add dp.get(base, 0) to ans.\n\nWait, so the ans is adding the count of base (the new base) in the dp array before the merge step. Because the merge step is for the key, which is different from the base.\n\nWait, but the dp array's entry for base (the new base) hasn't been touched yet. So the count of base in dp is whatever it was before this iteration.\n\nWait, but the initial dp array is all zeros. Let's see with an example.\n\nExample:\n\nn=1, m=2, a = [1]\n\nInitial base is 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nrem = 1 mod 2 =1.\n\nbase becomes (0 -1 +2) mod2 \u2192 (1) mod2 \u21921.\n\nkey = (1 +1) mod2 \u21922 mod2=0.\n\nSo dp[0] +=1 \u2192 dp[0] is now 1.\n\nThen, ans += dp[1] \u2192 which is 0 (since dp[1] was 0 before this iteration's merge). So ans remains 0.\n\nWait, but according to the problem's logic, what is the correct answer here?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct and the example's answer is 0. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is counting the number of times the current base has been seen before. Because when you process a[i], the new base is the value that would have been the previous base plus some terms. The ans is accumulating the count of the current base in the dp array before this step's merge. Because the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is a different value.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is actually (base + a[i]) mod m, but the ans is counting the number of previous occurrences of the current base. So the dp array is tracking the counts of the keys, which are different from the base.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should proceed with the array approach and see.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran, for the first part, we can represent the dp as an array of integers of size m, initialized to 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the second program (ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string x. The code processes it in two ways:\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nLoop from i=1 to length-1:\n\nIf current character is same as previous, change it to the opposite (0\u21921 or 1\u21920), and increment a1.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nLoop from i = length-1 downto 1:\n\nIf current character is same as previous, change the previous character to opposite, increment a2.\n\nThe minimum of a1 and a2 is output.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays. So we can read the string as a character array, process it for a1 and a2.\n\nThird program (codeforces_276_B):\n\nInput is a string (the output of the second program, which is a number, so the input is a string like \"4\").\n\nThe code counts the frequency of each character. If the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1 \u2192 \"First\", else if even \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the input is a string, which is the output of the second program. The second program outputs a number (the minimum of a1 and a2). So the third program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the second outputs 3, then the third's input is \"3\".\n\nThe third program then counts the characters in that string. For \"3\", the counts are: '3' \u21921 (odd). So oddCount is 1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother example: if the second outputs 12 \u2192 the string is \"12\". The characters are '1' and '2', each count 1 (both odd). So oddCount is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the third part will process the string (the output of the second step) to count character frequencies.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the first program's input: n, m, then n integers for a array.\n\n2. Compute the first program's ans using the array-based dp approach.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string x (the input for the second program).\n\n4. Process x to compute a1 and a2, then min_val = min(a1,a2).\n\n5. Convert min_val to a string str (input for third program).\n\n6. Process str to determine \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n7. Output the result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nFor the first part:\n\ninteger :: n, m, a(n), base, ans, dp(0:m-1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed sizes. Since m is a variable, we can't have an array of size m unless we use an allocatable array. So perhaps we need to read m first, then allocate the dp array.\n\nBut in the first step, the first program's input is n, m, then the array a. So the steps would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead the array a of size n.\n\nThen, allocate dp array of size m.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't have an array with size m unless m is known at compile time. So we need to use an allocatable array.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: dp(:)\n\n...\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate(dp(0:m-1))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in the first part's code:\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nbase = 0\n\nans = 0\n\nloop over each element in a:\n\n    rem = mod(a(i), m)\n\n    base = mod(base - rem + m, m)\n\n    key = mod(base + a(i), m)\n\n    dp(key) = dp(key) + 1\n\n    ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nWait, no, the ans += dp(base) is after the merge. Wait, in the code's logic, after updating base and computing key, the dp is updated for key, then ans is increased by the current count of base in dp (before the merge? Or after?).\n\nWait, in the code's original Java code:\n\nAfter updating base, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\nThen, dp.merge(key, 1, Integer::sum) \u2192 which is equivalent to dp[key] +=1.\n\nThen, ans += dp.get(base, 0).\n\nSo the ans is adding the current count of base in dp before the merge step (since the merge is for key, not base). Wait no, the merge is for key, so the count of base in dp is unchanged by the merge. So the ans is adding the current count of base in dp (before this iteration's merge step).\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So before this iteration, the dp array had counts from previous steps. The current base is the new value, so the count of base in dp is whatever it was before this iteration's processing. Because the merge is for key, not base.\n\nWait, let's see with the example:\n\nSuppose in the first iteration, after updating base to 1 (as before), the key is 0. So dp(0) becomes 1. Then, ans += dp(1). Since dp(1) was 0 before this iteration, ans becomes 0.\n\nBut in the next iteration, if base becomes something else, the count of the previous base may have been updated in a previous step.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct, and the logic is that the ans counts the number of times the current base has been seen before. Because the dp array tracks the counts of the keys, which are different from the base.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is actually (base + a[i]) mod m, but the ans is counting the number of times the current base has been seen before. The dp array is tracking the counts of the keys, which are different from the base. So the ans is not directly related to the dp array's current base count. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the code as per the Java logic, using the array approach.\n\nNow, moving to the second part:\n\nThe input x is the string representation of ans. So in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a string.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_str\n\nwrite(x_str, '(i0)') ans\n\nThen, trim the string to remove leading spaces.\n\nx_str = adjustl(x_str)\n\nThen, process this string.\n\nThe second program's processing:\n\nInitialize a1 and a2 to 0.\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nLoop from i=2 to len_trim(x_str):\n\ncurrent_char = x_str(i:i)\n\nprev_char = x_str(i-1:i-1)\n\nif current_char == prev_char:\n\n   change current_char to opposite (0\u21921 or 1\u21920)\n\n   a1 +=1\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so we can process them as such.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are not as flexible as Java's StringBuilder. So perhaps we can make copies of the string and modify them.\n\nAlternatively, for the first approach (a):\n\nWe can create a copy of the string, then loop from 2 to length:\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(x_str)\n\n   if (x_str(i:i) == x_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (x_str(i:i) == '1') then\n\n          x_str(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          x_str(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but modifying the original string may interfere with the second approach. So better to make a copy.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_copy_a = x_str\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i=2, len_trim(x_copy_a)\n\n   if (x_copy_a(i:i) == x_copy_a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (x_copy_a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n          x_copy_a(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          x_copy_a(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the second approach (b):\n\nWe need to process from the end backwards.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_copy_b = x_str\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(x_copy_b) -1, 1, -1\n\n   if (x_copy_b(i:i) == x_copy_b(i+1:i+1)) then\n\n      if (x_copy_b(i:i) == '1') then\n\n          x_copy_b(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          x_copy_b(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, in the second approach, the code in Java loops from the end to the start, changing the previous character when duplicates are found. Wait, the Java code for the second approach (a2) is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, right! So in the second approach, when a duplicate is found at position i and i-1, the code changes the (i-1)th character, not the ith. So the loop is from the end backwards, and when a duplicate is found between i and i-1, the (i-1)th is changed.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop from i = len_trim(x_copy_b) downto 2 (since i starts at length-1 in Java, which is len_trim-1 in Fortran).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--). So in Fortran, the loop would be from i = len_trim down to 2 (since i starts at len_trim (since x.length() is len_trim in Fortran), and goes down to 1, but the condition is i>0, so the last i is 1, but in the loop body, i-1 would be 0, which is invalid. Wait, perhaps the loop in Fortran should be from i = len_trim downto 2:\n\ndo i = len_trim(x_copy_b), 2, -1\n\n   if (x_copy_b(i-1:i-1) == x_copy_b(i:i)) then\n\n      if (x_copy_b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n          x_copy_b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n          x_copy_b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct. So the second approach's loop is from the end to the start, checking i and i-1, and changing the i-1 character.\n\nOnce a1 and a2 are computed, min_val = min(a1, a2).\n\nThen, the third part's input is the string representation of min_val.\n\nSo convert min_val to a string str:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nwrite(str, '(i0)') min_val\n\nstr = adjustl(str)\n\nThen, process this string to count character frequencies.\n\nThird part's processing:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in str.\n\nIn Fortran, we can use an array to count each character's occurrence.\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(256) :: char_counts = 0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters can be represented as integers via ichar. Alternatively, since the input is a string of digits (since min_val is a number), the characters are '0'-'9', so we can use an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) or 256 for all possible characters.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a number's string, the characters are only digits, so we can use an array of size 10.\n\ninteger, dimension(0:9) :: counts = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str)\n\n   c = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n   counts(c) = counts(c) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, count the number of odd counts:\n\ninteger :: oddCount =0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n   if (mod(counts(i),2) ==1) then\n\n      oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, decide the output:\n\nif (oddCount <=1) then\n\n   print *, 'First'\n\nelse if (mod(oddCount,2) ==0) then\n\n   print *, 'Second'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'First'  ! because if oddCount is odd and >1, then it's oddCount mod2 is 1, so else if is false, so else?\n\nWait, the condition in the Java code is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first.\n\nWait, the Java code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then first.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) {\n\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n\n} else {\n\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is: if oddCount is \u22641 OR oddCount is odd (since mod 2 !=0 \u2192 odd), then first. Else, second.\n\nWait, but oddCount can be 3 (which is odd and >1), so the condition is true, so first.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount is odd) ) \u2192 then first.\n\nElse (even and >1) \u2192 second.\n\nWait, but the code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 which is equivalent to:\n\nif (oddCount is \u22641 OR oddCount is odd).\n\nBut oddCount can be 3 (odd and >1), so it would print first.\n\nWait, but the problem's logic is that if the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1 \u2192 first can win by taking the last remaining character. If it's even, then second can win. Wait, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0 ) then\n\n   print *, 'First'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'Second'\n\nend if\n\nWait, but mod(oddCount,2) is 1 for odd, so mod(oddCount,2) !=0 \u2192 odd.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 OR oddCount is odd) \u2192 first.\n\nElse (even and >1) \u2192 second.\n\nYes.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, ans, a(100000) ! assuming n is up to 1e5, but need to read n first.\n\n!

So the array a must be allocatable.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), dp(:)\n\ninteger :: base, key, rem, min_val, a1, a2, oddCount\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_str, str\n\n!

Now, convert min_val to str:\n\nwrite(str, '(i0)') min_val\n\nstr = adjustl(str)\n\n! Process third part:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:9) :: counts =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(str)\n\n    integer :: c = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n    counts(c) = counts(c) +1\n\nend do\n\noddCount =0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n    if (mod(counts(i),2) ==1) then\n\n        oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Determine output:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0 ) then\n\n    print *, 'First'\n\nelse\n\n    print *, 'Second'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(a, dp)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but there are some possible issues:\n\n1. The array a is allocated with size n, which is read first. That's okay.\n\n2. The dp array is allocated as 0:m-1, which requires m to be positive. The problem likely ensures m is positive.\n\n3. The string conversions: using '(i0)' should write the integer without leading spaces, but adjustl is used to remove leading blanks.\n\n4. The second part's processing of the string: the copies x_copy_a and x_copy_b are made, and modified in loops.\n\n5. The third part's counts: only digits are considered, so the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's loop: the key is mod(base + a(i), m). Wait, in the Java code, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. But in Fortran, mod(base + a(i), m) gives the same result as (base + a(i)) mod m. So that's correct.\n\n- The ans += dp(base) is correct? Because in the Java code, after updating base and before merging the key, the ans is increased by the current count of base in the dp array. Since the dp array's base entry hasn't been modified in this iteration (only the key's entry is modified), this is correct.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter updating base, the key is computed, then dp(key) is incremented. Then ans += dp(base). So yes, the count of base in dp is before this iteration's changes (only key's count is changed).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop, the order of operations is correct.\n\nNow, testing with an example.\n\nExample for first part:\n\nn=1, m=2, a=[1]\n\nThen:\n\nInitial dp is [0,0].\n\nbase=0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nrem = mod(1,2)=1.\n\nbase = mod(0-1 +2, 2) \u2192 mod(1,2)=1.\n\nkey = mod(1+1,2)=2 mod2=0.\n\ndp(0) becomes 1.\n\nans += dp(1) \u2192 dp(1) is 0 \u2192 ans remains 0.\n\nSo ans is 0. So x_str is \"0\".\n\nSecond part processing:\n\nx_str is \"0\".\n\nProcessing a1:\n\nThe string is \"0\", length 1. So the loop from 2 to 1 doesn't execute. a1=0.\n\nProcessing a2:\n\nSame, loop from 1 down to 2 \u2192 no iterations. a2=0.\n\nmin_val is 0.\n\nThird part:\n\nstr is \"0\".\n\ncounts(0)=1, others 0.\n\noddCount is 1 (since 1 is odd).\n\nSo condition: oddCount <=1 \u2192 yes \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSuppose first part's ans is 3 \u2192 x_str is \"3\".\n\nSecond part:\n\nx_str is \"3\", length 1 \u2192 a1 and a2 are 0. min_val 0 \u2192 str is \"0\".\n\nSame as before \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother example where second part's output is 2 (even and >1):\n\nSuppose first part's ans is 12 \u2192 x_str is \"12\".\n\nSecond part processing:\n\nx_str is \"12\".\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nLoop from i=2:\n\ni=2: check \"1\" and \"2\" \u2192 no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nSo a1=0.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nLoop from i=2 down to 2:\n\ni=2: check characters 1 and 2 \u2192 \"1\" and \"2\" \u2192 no change. a2 remains 0.\n\nmin_val is 0 \u2192 str is \"0\" \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm, but let's think of a case where the second part's output is 2.\n\nSuppose x_str is \"11\".\n\nThen:\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nProcessing from left to right:\n\ni=2: \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change to 0. a1 becomes 1.\n\nSo a1=1.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nProcessing from right to left:\n\ni=2: check i=2 and 1 \u2192 both '1's. Change the first (i-1=1) to 0. a2 becomes 1.\n\nSo min_val is 1 \u2192 str is \"1\".\n\nThird part:\n\nstr is \"1\" \u2192 counts(1)=1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother example where second part's output is 2:\n\nSuppose x_str is \"111\".\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\ni=2: \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1=1.\n\ni=3: \"0\" and \"1\" \u2192 no change. So a1=1.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nProcessing from end:\n\ni=3: check 2 and 3 \u2192 \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change position 2 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1.\n\ni=2: check 1 and 2 \u2192 \"1\" and \"0\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1: not processed (since down to 2).\n\nSo a2=1.\n\nmin_val is 1 \u2192 str is \"1\" \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better example where min_val is 2.\n\nSuppose x_str is \"1122\".\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nProcessing left to right:\n\ni=2: \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 string becomes \"1022\".\n\ni=3: \"0\" and \"2\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=4: \"2\" and \"2\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 total a1=2.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nProcessing from end:\n\ni=4: check 3 and 4 \u2192 \"2\" and \"2\" \u2192 change position 3 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1 \u2192 string becomes \"1120\".\n\ni=3: check 2 and 3 \u2192 \"1\" and \"0\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: check 1 and 2 \u2192 \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change position 1 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1 \u2192 total a2=2.\n\nSo min_val is 2 \u2192 str is \"2\".\n\nThird part:\n\nstr is \"2\" \u2192 counts(2)=1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nHmm, but the third program's logic would have oddCount=1 \u2192 first.\n\nAnother example where min_val is 2 (even and >1):\n\nSuppose x_str is \"112211\".\n\nFirst approach (a):\n\nProcessing left to right:\n\ni=2: \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 string becomes \"102211\".\n\ni=3: \"0\" and \"2\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=4: \"2\" and \"2\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 \"102011\".\n\ni=5: \"0\" and \"1\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=6: \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change to 0 \u2192 a1 +=1 \u2192 total a1=3.\n\nSecond approach (b):\n\nProcessing from end:\n\ni=6: check 5 and 6 \u2192 \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change position 5 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1 \u2192 string becomes \"112210\".\n\ni=5: check 4 and 5 \u2192 \"2\" and \"0\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=4: check 3 and 4 \u2192 \"2\" and \"2\" \u2192 change position 3 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1 \u2192 \"112010\".\n\ni=3: check 2 and 3 \u2192 \"1\" and \"0\" \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: check 1 and 2 \u2192 \"1\" and \"1\" \u2192 change position 1 to 0 \u2192 a2 +=1 \u2192 total a2=3.\n\nmin_val is 3 \u2192 str is \"3\".\n\nThird part: counts(3)=1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 first.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's hard to find a case where the third program outputs \"Second\".\n\nLet me think of a case where the third program's input is \"1234\".\n\nThen, the characters are '1','2','3','4' \u2192 each count is 1 \u2192 oddCount=4 (even and >1 \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nSo let's see:\n\nSuppose second part's output is 1234 \u2192 min_val=1234 \u2192 str is \"1234\".\n\nThird part:\n\ncounts(1)=1, 2=1, 3=1,4=1 \u2192 oddCount=4 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nTo get there, the second part's min_val must be 1234. So the second program's input must be a string that requires a1 and a2 to be 1234 and something else, but that's a big number. But the code should handle it.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code should handle all these steps.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and that the loops are correct.\n\nAlso, note that in the first part, the array a is read as integers. The code uses a(1:n), which is okay in Fortran (arrays are 1-based by default).\n\nThe dp array is from 0 to m-1, which is correct.\n\nThe second part's string processing uses character arrays and loops correctly.\n\nThe third part's counts are for digits 0-9, which is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's loop uses a(i) which is correct.\n\n- The second part's string length is handled via len_trim.\n\n- The third part's loop over the string's characters.\n\nNow, the code should be written accordingly."
