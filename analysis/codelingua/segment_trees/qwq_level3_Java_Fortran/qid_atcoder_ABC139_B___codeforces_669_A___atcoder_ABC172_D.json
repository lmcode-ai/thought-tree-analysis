So the maximum n2 can be 2^31-1. So in Fortran, using integer for n2 is okay as long as the input is within 32-bit. But the first program's n1 is computed from A and B.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC139_B) reads two integers A and B from input. It calculates some result based on them and outputs it. The calculation is (B-1)/(A-1), then checks the remainder. If there's a remainder, it adds 1 to the result. So the result is essentially the ceiling of (B-1)/(A-1). \n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n from input, processes it by calculating (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder when divided by 3. Wait, the code is (n//3)*2 + (if n mod 3 is 0 then 0 else 1). So for example, if n is 4, 4/3 is 1, remainder 1, so 2 +1 =3. Wait, let me see: (4//3)=1, so 1*2=2, plus 1 because remainder is not zero. So total 3. Hmm, but maybe the formula is (n divided by 3) *2 plus 1 if the remainder is not zero. So the output is the maximum number of pairs possible when dividing into groups of 3, but adding an extra if there's a remainder. Wait, maybe the problem was about something like the number of pairs when you can form groups of 3, but each group contributes 2 pairs? Not sure, but the code is straightforward.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC172_D) takes an integer n, then computes a sum over i from 1 to n of i multiplied by (floor(n/i) * (floor(n/i)+1)/2). The final answer is the sum of all those terms. \n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third. So the entire sequence is: input A and B \u2192 first program outputs result \u2192 that result is the input n for the second program, which outputs another number \u2192 that number is the input for the third program, which finally outputs the final answer.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read A and B, compute the first result, then use that result as n for the second computation, then take that result as n for the third computation, and output the final answer from the third step.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst step: Compute the first result. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the first program's result is:\n\nresult = (B-1)/(A-1) but if there's a remainder, add 1. So in Fortran, integer division with ceiling. Since in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but to get the ceiling, perhaps (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1). Because (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1) would be equivalent to ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)). Let me check:\n\nSuppose (B-1) divided by (A-1) is q with remainder r. Then (B-1) = q*(A-1) + r, 0 \u2264 r < A-1. Then (B-1 + (A-2)) = q*(A-1) + r + A-2. Since r can be up to A-2 (since r < A-1), adding A-2 would make r + (A-2) up to (A-1 -1) + (A-2) = 2A-4? Wait, maybe better to think of ceiling division formula. The ceiling of x/y is (x + y -1)/y. So here x is (B-1), y is (A-1). So ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)) = (B-1 + (A-1) -1)/(A-1) ) = (B-1 + A-2)/(A-1) = (B + A -3)/(A-1). So yes, so in Fortran, that would be (B-1 + (A-1 -1)) divided by (A-1). So the result is (B + A -3) / (A-1). But since in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero, so (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1) would give the ceiling. So the first result can be computed as (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1). Wait, let me test with some numbers.\n\nExample 1: A=2, B=3. Then (3-1)/(2-1) = 2/1 =2, no remainder, so result is 2. Using the formula (3-1 + (2-2))/(2-1) \u2192 (2 +0)/1 =2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: A=3, B=5. (5-1)/(3-1)=4/2=2, no remainder \u2192 result 2. The formula (5-1 + (3-2))/(3-1) \u2192 (4+1)/2=5/2=2.5 \u2192 but integer division would be 2. Wait, but 5/2 is 2.5, so integer division in Fortran would be 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example where there is a remainder: A=3, B=6. (6-1)/(3-1)=5/2=2.5 \u2192 ceiling is 3. The formula (6-1 + (3-2)) =5+1=6 \u2192 6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=4. (4-1)/1 =3 \u2192 no remainder, so result 3. The formula (4-1 + (2-2)) \u21923+0=3/1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case where remainder exists: A=4, B=7. (7-1)/(4-1)=6/3=2 \u2192 no remainder. So result 2. But if B=8, then (8-1)/3 =7/3=2.333 \u2192 ceiling is 3. The formula (8-1 +3) \u21927+3=10? Wait, wait, A-2 is 4-2=2. So (8-1)+(4-2)=7+2=9. Divided by 3 (A-1=3) \u21929/3=3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. So in Fortran, the first result can be computed as (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1). So that's straightforward.\n\nSecond step: Take that result (let's call it n1) and compute the second result. The second Java program's code is (n1//3)*2 + (if n1 mod 3 !=0 then 1 else 0). So in Fortran, the same logic. Let me see:\n\nThe formula is (n1 / 3) * 2 + (mod(n1,3) ==0 ? 0 :1). So in Fortran, the integer division is done with /, and mod(n1,3) gives the remainder. So the second result is (n1 /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n1,3)/=0). Or alternatively, (n1//3)*2 + (1 if mod(n1,3).ne.0 then 1 else 0). So that can be written as (n1/3)*2 + (1 - (mod(n1,3) ==0)). Wait, no, better to compute it directly.\n\nThird step: Take the second result (n2) and compute the third result. The third Java program loops from i=1 to n, and for each i, adds i * ( (n2//i) * (n2//i +1) ) /2. The sum of all those terms.\n\nIn Fortran, loops are straightforward. The loop variable i from 1 to n2. For each i, compute term = i * ( (n2/i) * (n2/i +1) ) /2. Sum all terms.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so (n2/i) is the floor division. So that's correct. The term is i multiplied by (k*(k+1)/2), where k = n2//i. So the term is i * k*(k+1)/2. So the loop would be:\n\nans = 0\ndo i = 1, n2\n    k = n2 / i\n    ans = ans + i * k * (k +1) / 2\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations matters for integer division. Let me see: the term is (i) * (k*(k+1)/2). Since all variables are integers, the division by 2 must be done properly. Since k*(k+1) is even (since either k or k+1 is even), so dividing by 2 is exact. So in Fortran, the expression is okay.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will read A and B from input, compute the first result (n1), then compute n2 from n1, then compute the final answer using n2, then print the final answer.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read A and B as integers. Then compute n1 as (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1). Then compute n2 as (n1//3)*2 + (1 if mod(n1,3)/=0 else 0). Then compute the sum for the third step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared. Let me outline the steps:\n\nProgram sequence\n\nImplicit none\n\nInteger :: A, B, n1, n2, ans, i, k\n\nRead *, A, B\n\nCompute n1 = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1)\n\nCompute n2 = (n1 /3)*2 + (1 if mod(n1,3)/=0 else 0)\n\nThen compute ans as per the third step.\n\nWait, but how to compute the second part for n2?\n\nThe second part is adding 1 if the remainder is not zero. So:\n\nn2 = (n1 /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n1,3)/=0)\n\nAlternatively, n2 = (n1 /3)*2 + (mod(n1,3) .ne. 0)\n\nWait, because in Fortran, logical expressions evaluate to .true. (which is -1) or .false. (0). But adding that would be problematic. So better to use an if statement or a function.\n\nAlternatively, compute the remainder:\n\nremainder = mod(n1,3)\n\nif (remainder ==0) then\n\n    n2 = (n1/3)*2\n\nelse\n\n    n2 = (n1/3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nThen, for the third step, the loop:\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, n2\n\n    k = n2 /i\n\n    ans = ans + i * k * (k+1)/2\n\nend do\n\nThen print ans.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe program structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: A, B, n1, n2, ans, i, k\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, A, B\n\n! Compute first step\n\nn1 = (B-1 + A -2) / (A-1)\n\n! Compute second step\n\ninteger :: remainder\n\nremainder = mod(n1,3)\n\nif (remainder ==0) then\n\n    n2 = (n1/3)*2\n\nelse\n\n    n2 = (n1/3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\n! Compute third step\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, n2\n\n    k = n2 /i\n\n    ans = ans + i * k * (k+1)/2\n\nend do\n\n! Output the final answer\n\nprint*, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second step, do I need to declare remainder? Yes, I should add that variable. Alternatively, compute it inline.\n\nAlternatively, compute the remainder as part of the if condition, but in Fortran, variables must be declared. So adding 'integer :: remainder' in the declarations.\n\nWait, in the variable declarations, the variables are A, B, n1, n2, ans, i, k. So adding remainder to the list.\n\nWait, let me check the variables again:\n\nVariables needed:\n\nA, B (input)\n\nn1 (first result)\n\nn2 (second result)\n\nans (third result's final answer)\n\ni and k (loop variables)\n\nremainder (for the second step)\n\nSo in the declarations:\n\ninteger :: A, B, n1, n2, ans, i, k, remainder\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the first step, when A-1 is zero? Wait, but in the original Java code, A and B are read as integers. The problem might have constraints that A is not 1, but since the code is given, perhaps in the problem's context, A is at least 2. Because if A is 1, then A-1 is zero, which would cause division by zero. So the code probably expects A !=1. So in Fortran, we can assume that the input is valid, so no need to handle division by zero here.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nLet me take an example.\n\nSuppose input is A=2, B=3.\n\nFirst step: n1 = (3-1 +2-2)/(2-1) \u2192 (2 +0)/1 =2.\n\nSecond step: n1=2. mod(2,3)=2. So remainder is 2\u22600 \u2192 n2 = (2/3)*2 +1 \u2192 0*2 +1=1.\n\nThird step: n2=1. The loop from i=1 to 1:\n\ni=1:\n\nk =1/1=1\n\nterm =1 *1*(2)/2 \u21921*2/2=1 \u2192 term is 1. So ans=1.\n\nSo the final output is 1. Let me see what the third Java program would do with n=1.\n\nThird Java program's code for n=1:\n\nsum from i=1 to 1:\n\ni=1: term is 1 * (1//1)*( (1//1)+1)/2 \u21921 *1*(2)/2 \u21921*2/2=1. So sum is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see the first example where A=3, B=5.\n\nFirst step: (5-1 +3-2)/(3-1) \u2192 (4+1)/2 \u21925/2=2.5 \u2192 but integer division in Fortran would be 2.5 \u2192 but in Fortran, integer division truncates, so 5/2 is 2. Wait, but according to the formula, (B-1 +A-2) is 4+1=5, divided by (A-1)=2 \u21925/2=2.5 \u2192 but in Fortran, integer division would be 2. Wait, but earlier analysis said that the formula gives the ceiling. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, wait, in the first example where A=3, B=5, the original Java code computes (B-1)/(A-1) =4/2=2, so no remainder, so result is 2. Which is correct. The formula (B-1 + (A-2))/(A-1) is (4 +1)/2 =5/2=2.5 \u2192 but in Fortran, integer division would be 2.5 \u2192 2. So that's correct. Because the ceiling of 2 is 2. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but if the formula was (B-1 + (A-2))/(A-1), then when (B-1) is exactly divisible by (A-1), then adding (A-2) would not change the division. Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose (B-1) is divisible by (A-1). Then (B-1) = k*(A-1). Then (B-1 + (A-2)) =k*(A-1) + (A-2) = (A-1)(k) + (A-2). Then divided by (A-1) gives k + (A-2)/(A-1). Since (A-2) is less than (A-1), the division would be k + (A-2)/(A-1), so integer division would be k. Which is correct, because the remainder was zero, so the result is k. So the formula works.\n\nAnother test case where there is a remainder. Let's say A=3, B=6. Then (6-1)=5, divided by 2 (A-1) gives 2.5 \u2192 ceiling is 3. The formula (5 +1)/2 =6/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where A=2, B=4. (4-1)/(2-1)=3 \u2192 formula (3 +0)/1=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case where A=4, B=7. (7-1)=6 divided by 3 (A-1) is 2 \u2192 formula (6 +2)/3 \u21928/3=2.666 \u2192 integer division in Fortran is 2. Wait, but 6/3 is exactly 2, so the remainder is zero. So the formula gives (6+2)/3 =8/3=2.666 \u2192 integer division truncates to 2. Which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but 8/3 is 2.666, but the correct result is 2. So the formula works here.\n\nWait, but in this case, the formula gives 8/3=2.666 \u2192 integer division in Fortran would be 2, which is correct because the original calculation had no remainder. So the formula works.\n\nHmm, so the formula is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the second step with n1=2 (from first example):\n\nn1=2 \u2192 mod(2,3)=2\u22600 \u2192 n2= (2/3)*2 +1 \u2192 0*2 +1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n1=3 \u2192 mod(3,3)=0 \u2192 n2= (3/3)*2 \u21921*2=2.\n\nAnother example: n1=4 \u2192 mod(4,3)=1 \u2192 n2= (4/3)*2 +1 \u21921*2+1=3.\n\nThird step with n2=3:\n\nsum from i=1 to 3:\n\ni=1:\n\nk=3/1=3 \u2192 term 1 *3*(4)/2 \u21921*12/2=6 \u2192 term 6.\n\ni=2:\n\nk=3/2=1 \u2192 term 2 *1*(2)/2 \u21922*2/2=2 \u2192 term 2.\n\ni=3:\n\nk=3/3=1 \u2192 term 3 *1*2/2 \u21923*1=3 \u2192 term 3.\n\nTotal sum:6+2+3=11.\n\nWait, let me compute the third Java code for n=3:\n\nThe loop runs from 1 to 3.\n\ni=1: term is 1 * (3//1)*(3//1+1)/2 \u21921 *3*4/2 \u21926.\n\ni=2: 2 * (1)*(2)/2 \u21922*1*2/2 \u21922.\n\ni=3:3 * (1)*(2)/2 \u21923*1 \u21923.\n\nTotal 6+2+3=11. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nWait, in the code, the variables must be declared. Let me write the code step by step.\n\nThe program starts with:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: A, B, n1, n2, ans, i, k, remainder\n\nread*, A, B\n\nn1 = (B -1 + A -2) / (A -1)\n\nremainder = mod(n1,3)\n\nif (remainder ==0) then\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2\n\nelse\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, n2\n\n    k = n2 /i\n\n    ans = ans + i * k * (k+1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first step, the formula is (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1). So (B-1 + A-2) is the same as (B + A -3). So perhaps writing it as (B + A -3) / (A-1) is clearer. But either way is okay.\n\nTesting with the first example where A=2, B=3:\n\nn1 = (3+2-3)/(2-1) \u21922/1=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where A=3, B=5:\n\nn1 = (5+3-3)/(3-1) \u21925/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where A=3, B=6:\n\nn1 = (6+3-3)/2 \u21926/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where A=4, B=7:\n\nn1 = (7+4-3)/3 \u21928/3=2.666 \u2192 integer division gives 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but 7-1 is 6, divided by 3 (A-1=3) gives exactly 2, so remainder 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where A=2, B=5:\n\nFirst step: (5-1 +2-2)/(2-1) \u21924/1=4 \u2192 n1=4.\n\nSecond step: mod(4,3)=1 \u2192 n2= (4/3)*2 +1 \u21921*2+1=3.\n\nThird step: n2=3 \u2192 sum is 11 as before. So the final output is 11.\n\nWait, but let's see what the third program would do with n=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible integer overflows. The third program's loop can have large n2. For example, if n2 is up to 1e9, then the loop would take too long. But in the original Java code, the third program's loop runs up to n, which could be up to 1e9, but in practice, the problem constraints might limit it. However, in Fortran, the loop would be slow for large n2. But the problem requires to translate the code as is, so we have to proceed.\n\nBut the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So even if it's slow, the code must be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third step, the variables ans and the terms can be very large. The third Java program uses a long for ans, so in Fortran, we need to use integer*8 or some 64-bit integer. Wait, in the third Java program, the ans is declared as a long, so in Fortran, we need to use a 64-bit integer. Otherwise, for large n2, the sum could overflow a 32-bit integer.\n\nAh, right! The third Java program uses a long, so in Fortran, the ans variable must be a 64-bit integer. So in Fortran, we need to use integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18) to ensure it's 64-bit.\n\nSo the variables ans, and the terms in the loop must be 64-bit integers. So in the declarations, we need to adjust that.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: A, B, n1, n2, i, k, remainder\n\ninteger(8) :: ans\n\nread*, A, B\n\nn1 = (B -1 + A -2) / (A -1)\n\nremainder = mod(n1,3)\n\nif (remainder ==0) then\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2\n\nelse\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\nans = 0_8\n\ndo i=1, n2\n\n    k = n2 /i\n\n    ans = ans + int(i,8) * k * (k+1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop, the terms are:\n\ni is an integer (4 bytes?), but when multiplied by k (also integer), and then multiplied by (k+1)/2, which is integer. So to prevent overflow, the intermediate terms should be in 64-bit.\n\nAlternatively, cast i to integer(8) first. So:\n\nans = ans + int(i,8) * k * (k+1)/2\n\nBut k is an integer, so when multiplied by (k+1)/2, which is also integer, the product is integer. So converting i to 8-byte first ensures that the multiplication is done in 8-byte.\n\nAlternatively, all variables involved in the calculation should be 8-byte. But perhaps the code above is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, all variables involved in the third step (ans, i, k) should be 8-byte. But in the code, n2 is an integer (4 bytes). If n2 is large (like up to 1e9), then the loop will have 1e9 iterations, which is a problem. But the problem requires to translate the code as is, so even if it's slow, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the third Java program, the loop runs from 1 to n (which is the input to that program). The original code uses a for loop up to n. So in the third step, the loop in Fortran must run up to n2, which could be very large. For example, if the first program outputs a large n1, then the second step could output a large n2, leading to a loop with 1e9 iterations. That would be a problem in Fortran for large n2. But the problem says to translate the code as is, so we have to proceed.\n\nBut perhaps the problem constraints for the original Java programs have limits on the inputs such that n2 is manageable. But since the user hasn't provided constraints, we have to proceed with the code as given.\n\nSo the code with 64-bit integers for ans is necessary. So the variables ans must be integer(8), and the terms in the loop must be cast to 8-byte.\n\nAnother thing: in the loop, the term is i * k * (k+1)/2. Since k is n2//i, which is an integer, so (k+1) is also integer. The division by 2 is exact because either k or k+1 is even. So the product is an integer. So converting i to integer(8) and multiplying with the rest (which are integers) will be okay.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together with the correct data types.\n\nFinal code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: A, B, n1, n2, i, remainder\n\ninteger(8) :: ans, k\n\nread*, A, B\n\nn1 = (B -1 + A -2) / (A -1)\n\nremainder = mod(n1,3)\n\nif (remainder ==0) then\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2\n\nelse\n\n    n2 = (n1 /3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\nans = 0_8\n\ndo i=1, n2\n\n    k = n2 /i\n\n    ans = ans + int(i,8) * k * (k+1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop, k is computed as n2/i. Since n2 is an integer (4 bytes?), but if n2 is large (like 1e9), then n2/i can be up to 1e9, but stored in an integer (4 bytes) would overflow. Wait, but in Fortran, the default integer is 4 bytes, so if n2 is up to 1e9, then n2 is stored as an integer(4), which can only hold up to 2^31-1 (~2e9). So if n2 is up to 1e9, that's okay. But if n2 is larger than 2e9, then it would overflow. But the original Java code uses int for n in the second program, which is 32-bit. So the maximum n2 can be 2^31-1. So in Fortran, using integer for n2 is okay as long as the input is within 32-bit.\n\nBut the first program's n1 is computed from A and B. The first Java program uses int for A and B, so their maximum is 2^31-1. So the first program's n1 could be up to (B-1 + A-2)/(A-1). If A is 2 and B is 2^31, then n1 would be (2^31-1 +0)/1 = 2^31-1, which is within 32-bit. So n2 can be up to (n1//3)*2 +1, which is also within 32-bit. So the variables can be stored as 4-byte integers.\n\nTherefore, the variables A, B, n1, n2, remainder can be 4-byte integers. Only ans needs to be 8-byte because the sum can be large.\n\nWait, let's see the third step's ans. For example, if n2 is 1e5, then the loop runs 1e5 times. Each term can be up to i*( (1e5/i) * (1e5/i +1)/2 ). The maximum term would be when i=1: 1 * (1e5)*(1e5+1)/2 ~ 5e9. Adding 1e5 terms of that size would be way over 2e9, so ans must be 64-bit.\n\nYes, so ans must be 8-byte. The other variables can be 4-byte.\n\nSo the code is okay as written.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first step, when computing (B-1 + A-2) divided by (A-1). Since B and A are integers, their sum can be up to 2^31-1 + 2^31-1, but when divided by (A-1), which is at least 1 (assuming A>=2), so n1 can be up to (2^31-1 + 2^31-1 -3)/1 \u2192 but that's way over 2^31-1. Wait, but in Java, the first program uses int for A and B, so their maximum is 2^31-1. So (B-1 + A-2) can be up to (2^31-2 + 2^31-3) = 2*(2^31) -5, which is way larger than 2^31-1. So in Java, this would cause an integer overflow. But the problem's original code may have constraints on A and B such that this doesn't happen. Or perhaps the problem expects that A and B are such that the computation doesn't overflow. Since the user hasn't specified, we have to proceed with the code as given.\n\nIn Fortran, the variables A and B are 4-byte integers, so adding them could overflow. But again, assuming the input is valid, the code is okay.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as above."
