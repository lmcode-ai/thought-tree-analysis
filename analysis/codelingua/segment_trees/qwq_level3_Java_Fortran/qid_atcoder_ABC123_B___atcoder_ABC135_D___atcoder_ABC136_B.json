    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (ABC123_B) reads input, processes it, and outputs a number. The second (ABC135_D) takes that output as input, processes it, and outputs another number. The third (ABC136_B) takes that second output and finally prints the result. The goal is to combine all three into one Fortran program without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nLet me break down each Java program step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (ABC123_B):\n\nIt reads 5 integers from input. For each, it calculates r[i] = a[i] mod 10. Then, if r[i] isn't zero, it calculates b = 10 - r[i] and stores in a TreeMap. The TreeMap's keys are the b values, and the values are the a[i] elements. \n\nThen, if the TreeMap is empty (all a[i] end with 0), the answer is the sum of all a[i]. Otherwise, it finds the last key in the TreeMap (the largest b?), gets the corresponding a[i] (last?), and then calculates the total by adding all a[i] except the last one, rounding them up to the next 10 (since if r[i] isn't zero, they add 10 - r[i] to make it a multiple of 10). The last element is added as is. Wait, no, the code adds the last element normally? Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe loop for the answer:\n\nFor each i except the index of 'last', if a[i] mod10 is 0, add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). Then add the last element.\n\nWait, the last element is the one stored in the TreeMap's last key. The TreeMap is sorted by key, so the last key is the largest b. The corresponding a[i] is the one with the largest b (since b is 10 - r[i], so the largest b would be when r[i] is smallest, like 1 gives b=9, etc. So the last key's a[i] is the one with the smallest remainder? Or maybe the largest b. Hmm.\n\nBut the code then adds the last element as is. So the total is sum of all except the last element, rounded up to the next 10 (except those already multiples of 10), plus the last element as is. Wait, no, the last element is included as is. Wait, the code for the last element is added at the end: ans += last. So the other elements are rounded up except the last one? Or is the last element the one that's not rounded?\n\nWait, the code for the other elements (i != idx) is adding either a[i] (if mod10 is 0) or a[i] + (10 - r[i]). The last element (the one at index idx) is added at the end. So the last element is not part of the loop, so it's added as is. Wait, but in the loop, the code is for i != idx, so the last element is not included in that loop. Then, after the loop, ans += last. So the last element is added as is. So the total is sum of all except the last element, rounded up to the next 10 (except those already multiples of 10), plus the last element's actual value. \n\nWait, but the last element's r[i] is non-zero, because it's in the TreeMap. Because the TreeMap only includes a[i] where r[i] !=0. So the last element's r[i] is non-zero, so when adding it, since it's not part of the loop, it's added as is. So the total would be the sum of all elements except the last, rounded up to the next 10, plus the last element's actual value. \n\nHmm, that's a bit tricky. So the first program's output is this calculated ans.\n\nNow, the second Java program (ABC135_D) takes a string input (from the first program's output?), but wait, the first program outputs a number. Wait, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string? Because the second Java program reads a string via sc.next(). So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program as a string. \n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string of digits, perhaps? Let me check the code. The second program's code is:\n\nIt reads a string (char array) from input. Then it does some DP with mod 13. The output is the value of dp[...][5]. The problem is probably counting the number of ways to replace '?' in the string with digits so that the number mod 13 is 5, modulo 1e9+7. \n\nSo the second program's input is a string (like \"123?45\"), and the output is a number. \n\nThen the third program (ABC136_B) takes that number as input N, and counts how many numbers from 1 to N have an odd number of digits. \n\nWait, the third program's code: \n\nIt reads N, counts the number of digits (count). Then loops over each digit length from 1 to count. For each i (digit length), if it's the last digit count (i=count), then if i is odd, add (N - 10^{i-1} +1). Else, for other i's, if i is 1, add 9, else if i is odd, add 10^i -10^{i-1}. \n\nSo the total is the count of numbers with an odd number of digits up to N. \n\nPutting it all together, the first program's output is a number, which is the input to the second program (as a string?), but wait, the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output must be a string. Wait, but the first program outputs a number via System.out.println(ans). So when you run the first program, its output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the input is sc.next(), which is the entire line as a string). So the first program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the second program. \n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string of digits (like \"12345\"), so the first program's output must be a number that is a string of digits. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, is a string of digits. So the second program reads that as a string. \n\nThen the second program's output is a number (the DP result), which is then the input to the third program. The third program reads that number as N. \n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nInput -> first program -> output number -> second program (input is that number as a string) -> output number -> third program (input is that number) -> final output.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, the last writing output, and the middle steps processing data without I/O.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (the 5 integers) from stdin.\n\n2. Process them through the first program's logic, getting the first output (ans1).\n\n3. Use ans1 as the input to the second program's logic. But the second program's input is a string, so ans1 must be converted to a string (as a character array). \n\nWait, but in the original sequence, the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a string. So in the Fortran program, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string (like \"12345\"), then process that string through the second program's logic, getting ans2.\n\nThen, ans2 is the input to the third program, which reads it as an integer N, and computes the final answer.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the 5 integers from input (first program's input).\n\n- Compute ans1 (first program's output).\n\n- Convert ans1 to a string (as a character array) to be the input for the second program's processing.\n\n- Process that string through the second program's logic to get ans2.\n\n- Then, take ans2 as an integer, process through the third program's logic to get the final answer.\n\n- Finally, print the final answer.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst program's variables:\n\n- a is an array of 5 integers.\n\n- r is an array of 5 integers (a[i] mod 10).\n\n- TreeMap in Java is a sorted map. The keys are the b values (10 - r[i] when r[i] !=0). The TreeMap is sorted by key, so the last key is the maximum b. The corresponding a[i] is the one with the largest b (since TreeMap is sorted in natural order). \n\nIn Fortran, we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i]. Since TreeMap is sorted, the last key is the maximum. So instead of a TreeMap, we can track the maximum b and the a[i] that has that b. \n\nWait, but there might be multiple a[i] with the same b. But the TreeMap's lastKey would be the maximum b, and the value stored would be the a[i] that was last inserted with that key? Or does TreeMap allow multiple entries with the same key? No, TreeMap keys are unique. So for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then b is 10 - r[i], and we add that to the map. So if two a's have the same b, only the last one would be stored? Or the first? Because TreeMap's put replaces the existing entry. Wait, in Java, when you put a key that already exists, the previous value is replaced. So the TreeMap will have each key only once, with the last a[i] that had that b. \n\nHmm, but in the code, the TreeMap is built by iterating over all a[i], so for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then the key is b = 10 - r[i], and the value is a[i]. So if two a's have the same b, the later one will overwrite the previous entry. \n\nTherefore, the TreeMap's lastKey is the maximum b, and the corresponding a[i] is the one that was last added with that b. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed so that the TreeMap's last entry is the one with the largest b, and the a[i] is the one that has that b. \n\nBut in any case, in Fortran, perhaps we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i]. \n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the b and a[i] pairs where r[i] !=0, then find the one with the maximum b. \n\nSo steps for first program in Fortran:\n\nRead 5 integers into an array a(5).\n\nCompute r(i) = mod(a(i),10) for each i.\n\nCollect all the b values (10 - r(i)) where r(i) !=0, along with the a(i).\n\nIf there are none (all r(i) are 0), then ans is sum(a).\n\nElse, find the maximum b among the collected b's. The corresponding a is the one with that b (but which one if there are duplicates? The last one in the list? Because in Java's TreeMap, the last entry would be the one with the highest key, so if two have the same key, the later one overwrites, so the last one in the list would be stored. Wait, but if two a's have the same b, then the later a's would overwrite the previous entry. So the TreeMap's value for that key would be the last a[i] with that b. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to replicate this, when collecting the pairs, if two a's have the same b, we need to keep the last one. \n\nAlternatively, since we are only interested in the maximum b, perhaps the maximum b is unique? Not necessarily. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum b is the maximum of all (10 - r[i]) where r[i] !=0. So the maximum b is the maximum of (10 - r[i]). The a[i] that has this maximum b is any of the a's with that b. But the code in Java uses the last a[i] that had that b. \n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nmap.put(b, a[i]);\n\nSo for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, it adds the key b and value a[i]. So if two a's have the same b, the later a's will overwrite the previous entry. So the final entry in the map for that key is the last a[i] with that b. \n\nTherefore, the maximum b is the maximum of all (10 - r[i]) where r[i] !=0. The a[i] corresponding to that maximum b is the last a[i] in the list (the array) that had that b. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to find the a[i] with the maximum b, we can:\n\n- Iterate through all a's, collect all (b, a[i]) pairs where r[i] !=0.\n\n- Find the maximum b among them.\n\n- Among those a's with that b, pick the last one in the array (since the later a's overwrite the TreeMap's entry).\n\nSo in code:\n\nInitialize max_b = -1, last_a = 0.\n\nLoop over each i from 1 to 5 (Fortran arrays start at 1? Or 0? Wait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound, but by default, they start at 1. So assuming a(5) is the array with indices 1-5.)\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps better to use 1-based for easier translation, but need to be careful.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++), so indices 0-4. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based, so indices 1-5. \n\nSo for each i from 1 to 5:\n\nr(i) = mod(a(i),10)\n\nif r(i) /=0 then:\n\n    b = 10 - r(i)\n\n    if b > max_b then:\n\n        max_b = b\n\n        last_a = a(i)\n\n    else if b == max_b then:\n\n        last_a = a(i)  ! because this is the later a[i]\n\nSo this way, we track the maximum b and the last a[i] that achieved it. \n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the b and a pairs, then find the maximum b, then among those with that b, pick the last one in the list. \n\nEither way, this approach would capture the same logic as the TreeMap's last entry. \n\nOnce we have max_b and last_a (the a[i] with the maximum b, and the last one if there are duplicates), then:\n\nif there are no entries (max_b is -1?), then sum all a's.\n\nElse:\n\nans = sum of all a's except last_a, but each of those a's (except last_a) are rounded up to the next 10 (except those already multiples of 10). \n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <5; i++) {\n\n    if (i != idx) {\n\n        if (a[i]%10 ==0 then add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i])\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nthen add last.\n\nWait, the last is added as is. \n\nSo the total is:\n\nsum over all a except last_a: (if mod10 is 0, add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i])) \n\nplus last_a.\n\nWait, but the r[i] for the last_a is non-zero (since it was in the TreeMap). So the last_a's contribution is added as is. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i =1 to 5\n\n    if (a(i) == last_a) then\n\n        continue  ! skip for now\n\n    else\n\n        if (mod(a(i),10) ==0) then\n\n            sum = sum + a(i)\n\n        else\n\n            r_i = mod(a(i),10)\n\n            sum = sum + a(i) + (10 - r_i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nsum = sum + last_a\n\nans1 = sum\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, moving to the second program (ABC135_D). \n\nThe second program takes a string (the output of the first program, which is a number, so the string is the digits of ans1). \n\nThe second program's code is a DP problem. Let me parse it.\n\nThe problem is to compute the number of ways to replace '?' in the input string with digits such that the resulting number mod 13 is 5, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe DP approach uses a DP table where dp[i][j] is the number of ways up to the i-th character (from the end?) to have a remainder of j mod 13. \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe input is a char array cs. The loop is over i from 0 to cs.length-1, but the index is handled as cs.length -1 -i. So the first iteration processes the last character, then the second the second last, etc. So the processing is from the end towards the start. \n\nThe DP array is of size [cs.length][13], and the base is initialized as 1, then multiplied by 10 mod13 each step. \n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each position (starting from the end), for each possible previous remainder (pre), and for each possible digit (0-9 or the fixed digit if not '?'), compute the new remainder and accumulate the counts. \n\nThe final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5], which is the last element of the dp array's last row (since the indices are 0-based in Java). \n\nIn Fortran, we need to represent this DP. \n\nFirst, the input to the second program is the string representation of ans1. So in the Fortran program, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statements into a character variable. \n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\nThen, we can process the characters of s. \n\nBut need to make sure leading zeros are not an issue? Well, the original Java code would read the entire string, including leading zeros if present. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so leading zeros would not be present. So the string s will be the digits of ans1, without leading zeros. \n\nNow, the second program's processing steps:\n\nInitialize a DP array. Since in Java it's a 2D array of longs, in Fortran, we can use an array of integers (but need to handle modulo 1e9+7). \n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be a 2D array, say dp(0: len-1, 0:12), where len is the length of the string. \n\nWait, in Java, the array is length of the string, so in Fortran, the first dimension is from 0 to len-1 (since in Java it's 0-based). \n\nThe base variable in Java starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod13. \n\nThe code in Java loops over i from 0 to cs.length-1. For each i, the current character is at position cs.length-1 -i. \n\nWait, let me re-express the loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n    current_char = cs[ cs.length-1 -i ]\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nSo for i=0, it's the last character of the string (index length-1), then i=1 is the second last, etc. \n\nThe DP for each step i (from 0 to len-1) depends on the previous step (i-1). \n\nThe base is initially 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod13. \n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nIf the current character is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9), we consider it. \n\nElse, the digit is fixed. \n\nFor each possible previous remainder (pre from 0-12), and for each possible next digit (d), compute the new remainder: (base * d + pre) mod13. \n\nWait, the formula in the code is:\n\nnew_remainder = (base * next + pre) %13 \n\nWait, in the Java code, the next is the digit (either 0-9 or the fixed value). \n\nThe base is initially 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod13. \n\nWait, the base is updated as base = base *10 mod13 after each step. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nbase is initialized to 1.\n\nThen, after processing each i (from 0 to len-1), the base is updated as base = base *10 mod13. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; ... ) {\n\n    ... \n\n    base = base *10 %13;\n\n}\n\nSo the base is updated after processing each i. \n\nHmm, the base is used in the next step. \n\nWait, the base is part of the calculation for the next step. \n\nThe DP for step i (processing the (cs.length-1 -i)th character) uses the current base. \n\nWait, perhaps the base represents the multiplier for the current digit. \n\nThe DP is tracking the remainder mod13 of the number formed so far. \n\nThe way the DP works is that for each position, the current digit contributes (digit * base) to the total mod13. \n\nWait, perhaps the base is the power of 10 corresponding to the current digit's place. \n\nLet me think of the number as being built from the end. \n\nSuppose the string is \"d0 d1 d2 ... dn-1\", where d0 is the first digit (the leftmost?), but in the code, the processing is from the end. \n\nWait, the first character processed is the last character of the string (the rightmost digit). \n\nThe base starts at 1 (for the first digit's contribution: digit * 1 mod13). \n\nThen, after processing that digit, the base becomes 10 mod13 (since base *=10). \n\nThe next digit (the second last) is multiplied by 10 (the new base) when added. \n\nWait, the base is the multiplier for the current digit. \n\nSo for the first step (i=0, processing the last digit):\n\ndigit contributes digit * 1 mod13. \n\nThen, the next step (i=1, processing the second last digit):\n\ndigit contributes digit *10 mod13. \n\nThen, the next step (i=2, third last digit):\n\ndigit contributes digit *100 mod13 (since base is 10*10 mod13 = 9, then 9*10 mod13 = 12, etc). \n\nThus, the base is the 10^i mod13, where i is the step number. \n\nThe DP[i][j] represents the number of ways to have a remainder of j mod13 after processing the first (i+1) digits (from the end). \n\nThe transitions are as follows:\n\nFor each step i (processing the (len-1 -i)th character):\n\nIf the current character is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9):\n\n    for each previous remainder pre (0-12):\n\n        new_remainder = (digit * base + pre) mod13 \n\n        dp[i][new_remainder] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\nElse, the digit is fixed, so only that digit is considered. \n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nfor (pre in 0..12):\n\n    next is the digit (fixed or variable)\n\n    new_remainder = (base * next + pre) mod13 \n\n    dp[i][new_remainder] += ... \n\nWait, the code in Java uses:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += ... \n\nWait, the base is the multiplier for the next digit. \n\nWait, the formula is (base * next + pre) mod13. \n\nWait, perhaps the current digit is multiplied by the base (which is 10^i mod13?), and added to the previous remainder. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP is tracking the remainder so far, and the current digit contributes (digit * base) to the total. \n\nThus, the new remainder is (previous_remainder + digit * base) mod13. \n\nWait, but in the code, it's (base * next + pre) mod13. \n\nWait, the code's formula is (base * next + pre) mod13. \n\nWait, that would be (digit * base + previous_remainder) mod13. \n\nYes, that's the same as (previous_remainder + digit * base) mod13. \n\nSo the DP transitions are correct. \n\nIn Fortran, the DP array can be represented as a 2D array. Since the maximum length of the string is up to, say, 100 (since the first program's output is a sum of up to 5*1e9, but probably not that big, but to be safe, let's assume a reasonable size). \n\nBut in the first program, the maximum possible ans1 is 5*1e9 (if all a[i] are 1e9). But in practice, the input a's are probably up to 1e9 each, so the sum could be up to 5e9, which is a 10-digit number. So the string length is up to 10. \n\nThus, the DP array can be dimensioned as (0:9, 0:12). \n\nThe steps in Fortran for the second program:\n\n1. Convert ans1 to a string s. \n\n2. Get the length len = len_trim(s). \n\n3. Initialize the DP array. \n\n   - dp is a 2D array of integers (modulo 1e9+7). \n\n   - We can use a 2D array with dimensions (0:len-1, 0:12). \n\n   - Initialize dp(0: len-1, 0:12) to 0. \n\n4. Initialize base =1. \n\n5. For each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = s(len - i)  (since in Fortran, the first character is s(1), so for i=0, it's the last character (position len), but in Fortran strings are 1-based. Wait, need to be careful with indices. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the string s is 1-based. So s(1) is the first character, s(len) is the last. \n\nThe Java code processes the characters in reverse order (starting from the end). \n\nSo for i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = s( len - i ) \n\nWait, when i=0, it's the last character (position len). \n\nYes. \n\nThen, for each step i:\n\n    if current_char is '?', then loop over digits 0-9.\n\n    else, the digit is fixed (digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')). \n\n    Then, for each pre in 0..12:\n\n        if i ==0:\n\n            previous_dp is 1 if pre ==0 else 0 (since for the first step, the previous is nothing, so only pre=0 is valid?)\n\n        else:\n\n            previous_dp is dp(i-1, pre)\n\n        then, for each possible next digit (either 0-9 or fixed):\n\n            new_remainder = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_dp, MOD )\n\nWait, but in the code, the transitions are additive. \n\nWait, in the Java code, for each pre and next:\n\ndp[i][new_remainder] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\nThen mod MOD. \n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    if current_char is '?', then loop over next_digit from 0 to9:\n\n        for each pre in 0 to12:\n\n            if i ==0:\n\n                prev_count = 1 if pre ==0 else 0\n\n            else:\n\n                prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n\n    else:\n\n        next_digit = digit (fixed)\n\n        for each pre in 0 to12:\n\n            prev_count = ... same as above\n\n            new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_rem) = mod( ... )\n\nWait, but in the code, for each pre and next, the contribution is added. \n\nWait, in the Java code, for each pre and next, the code loops over all pre and next, and adds to the new_remainder. \n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, for each i, we need to first initialize the current dp[i] to zero, then loop over all possible pre and next, and accumulate. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array. \n\nInitially, dp(0,:) is all zero except for the first step. \n\nWait, let me think step by step. \n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (0:len-1, 0:12). \n\nInitialize all elements to 0. \n\nThen, for i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = s(len -i) \n\n    if i ==0:\n\n        previous_dp is the initial state (pre=0 has count 1, others 0)\n\n    else:\n\n        previous_dp is dp(i-1, : )\n\n    Now, for the current step, we need to compute dp(i, : )\n\n    So, for each possible next_digit (either 0-9 or fixed):\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            prev_count = (i ==0) ? (pre ==0 ?1 :0) : dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n\n    But if the current_char is not '?', then next_digit is fixed, so only that digit is considered. \n\nWait, but in the code, for each pre and next, the contribution is added. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = s(len -i)\n\n    if current_char == '?' then:\n\n        do next_digit =0,9\n\n            do pre =0,12\n\n                prev_count = (i ==0) ? (pre ==0) ?1 :0 : dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n\n            end do\n\n        end do\n\n    else:\n\n        digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            prev_count = (i ==0) ? (pre ==0) ?1 :0 : dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            new_rem = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this approach may have overlapping updates. Because for each next_digit and pre, the new_rem is computed and added to dp(i, new_rem). However, in this way, when multiple next_digits contribute to the same new_rem, they are added properly. \n\nWait, but in the code above, for each next_digit and pre, the contribution is added to dp(i, new_rem). \n\nYes, this should work. \n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so need to adjust indices. \n\nAlternatively, use 0-based indices. \n\nAlternatively, use 1-based for the DP array. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use 0-based for the first dimension (i from 0 to len-1). \n\nBut in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. \n\nSo, for example:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: dp(0:len-1, 0:12)\n\nThen, initialize dp to 0. \n\nThen, proceed as above. \n\nAfter processing all steps, the answer is dp(len-1,5). \n\nSo the second program's output is this value. \n\nNow, the third program (ABC136_B) takes this ans2 (the output of the second program) and computes the count of numbers from 1 to N (ans2) with an odd number of digits. \n\nThe third program's code:\n\nRead N, count the number of digits (count). \n\nLoop over each digit length from 1 to count:\n\n    if i == count:\n\n        if i is odd, add (N - 10^{i-1} +1)\n\n    else:\n\n        if i ==1: add 9\n\n        else if i is odd: add 10^i -10^{i-1}\n\nThe total is the sum of these. \n\nIn Fortran, to compute this:\n\nFirst, compute the number of digits in N. \n\ncount = 0\n\ntemp = N\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    count = count +1\n\n    temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, initialize ans =0\n\ndo i=1, count\n\n    if (i == count) then\n\n        if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        if (i ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans +9\n\n        else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut need to handle exponents correctly. \n\nIn Fortran, exponentiation can be done with ** operator. \n\nBut for large exponents (like 10^9), but since N is the output of the second program, which can be up to 1e9+7, but the third program's N is that value. \n\nWait, the second program's output is modulo 1e9+7, so N can be up to 1e9+6. \n\nThus, 10^i can be up to 1e9, which is manageable. \n\nSo the third program's logic is straightforward. \n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program will:\n\n1. Read the 5 integers from input. \n\n2. Compute ans1 via the first program's logic. \n\n3. Convert ans1 to a string. \n\n4. Compute ans2 via the second program's DP. \n\n5. Compute the final answer via the third program's logic. \n\n6. Print the final answer. \n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code step by step. \n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- For the first part:\n\ninteger :: a(5), r(5), max_b, last_a, ans1, idx, i\n\n- For the second part:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger :: len, MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: dp(0:19, 0:12)  ! assuming max length 20\n\ninteger :: base, ans2, digit, next_digit, pre, new_rem\n\n- For the third part:\n\ninteger :: N, count, temp, ans3, i\n\nNow, step by step code:\n\nRead the first part's input:\n\nread*, a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4), a(5)\n\nCompute r(i) = mod(a(i),10) for each i. \n\nThen, find max_b and last_a:\n\nmax_b = -1\n\nlast_a =0\n\ndo i=1,5\n\n    r_i = mod(a(i),10)\n\n    if (r_i /=0) then\n\n        b = 10 - r_i\n\n        if (b > max_b) then\n\n            max_b = b\n\n            last_a = a(i)\n\n        else if (b == max_b) then\n\n            last_a = a(i)  ! since this is the later a[i]\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (max_b == -1) then  ! all r_i are zero\n\n    ans1 = sum(a(1:5))\n\nelse\n\n    sum_temp =0\n\n    do i=1,5\n\n        if (a(i) == last_a) cycle\n\n        r_i = mod(a(i),10)\n\n        if (r_i ==0) then\n\n            sum_temp = sum_temp + a(i)\n\n        else\n\n            sum_temp = sum_temp + a(i) + (10 - r_i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ans1 = sum_temp + last_a\n\nend if\n\nNow, convert ans1 to a string s:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\nlen = len_trim(s)\n\nNow, process the second part:\n\nInitialize dp to 0:\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n    do j=0,12\n\n        dp(i,j) =0\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nbase =1\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n    current_char = s(len -i)  ! since s is 1-based, len is the length. \n\n    if (i ==0) then\n\n        ! previous is pre=0 has count 1\n\n        ! but need to initialize dp(0, :) \n\n        !

Need to declare it as an integer inside the loops. \n\nAh, right! I missed declaring prev_count. \n\nSo in the loops where prev_count is used, we need to declare it as an integer. \n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nInside the loops for the second part:\n\n    do i=0, len-1\n        character(1) :: current_char\n        current_char = s(len -i) \n\n        if (current_char == '?') then\n            do next_digit=0,9\n                do pre=0,12\n                    integer :: prev_count\n                    if (i ==0) then\n                        prev_count = 0\n                        if (pre ==0) prev_count =1\n                    else\n                        prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n                    end if\n                    new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n                    dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n                end do\n            end do\n        else\n            digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n            do pre=0,12\n                integer :: prev_count\n                if (i ==0) then\n                    prev_count =0\n                    if (pre ==0) prev_count =1\n                else\n                    prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n                end if\n                new_rem = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n                dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n            end do\n        end if\n\n        base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n    end do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before their use in the scope. \n\nAlternatively, declare prev_count inside the loop's scope. \n\nAlternatively, move the declaration outside. \n\nAlternatively, compute prev_count inline. \n\nAlternatively, use an if statement without a variable:\n\nBut perhaps better to declare prev_count as an integer inside the loop. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can declare variables inside a block. \n\nAlternatively, inside the do pre loop:\n\n    do pre=0,12\n        integer :: prev_count\n        if (i ==0) then\n            prev_count = 0\n            if (pre ==0) prev_count =1\n        else\n            prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n        end if\n        new_rem = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n        dp(i, new_rem) = mod( dp(i, new_rem) + prev_count, MOD )\n    end do\n\nThis should work. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's code, the current_char is a single character. \n\nAlso, in the line:\n\ncurrent_char = s(len -i)\n\nBut when i=0, len -i is len, which is the last character of the string. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother possible issue: the DP array is initialized to zero before the loop. \n\nYes, the line dp =0 sets all elements to zero. \n\nNow, testing for possible errors:\n\nIn the first part, when all a[i] are multiples of 10, then max_b is -1, so ans1 is sum(a). \n\nIn the second part, the string s is correctly formed. \n\nIn the third part, the count of digits is correct. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the third program's code, when i is the count (the number of digits), the term N -10^{i-1} +1 must be non-negative. \n\nYes, since N is at least 10^{i-1} (since it has i digits). \n\nNow, the final code should be as above, with the corrections for prev_count declarations. \n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as written, with the necessary variable declarations and loops."
