    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC166_C). It reads N and M, then an array H of N longs. It also initializes a boolean array ans. Then, for M times, it reads two integers, compares the H values of those indices (adjusted for 0-based), and sets the corresponding ans entries to false if one is smaller. If equal, both are set to false. Finally, it counts how many ans entries are true and prints that count.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, processes it to compute some modulo counts for 2019. It calculates the number of pairs of indices where the difference in their mod values is 0 mod 2019, using some mathematical approach. The output is the count of such pairs.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_579_A) reads an integer n, converts it to binary, counts the number of 1s in the binary representation, and outputs that count.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But since they are to be run in sequence, the Fortran program must process all steps in sequence without I/O in the middle.\n\nWait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (the count ans2) is the input to the second program? Wait, no, looking at the Java code:\n\nWait, the first program's output is ans2 (the count of true in ans). The second program expects input as a string S. So that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The user says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But looking at the code:\n\nFirst program's output is a number (ans2). The second program expects a string S as input. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the sequence is different? Wait, maybe the three Java files are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are connected in a way that the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output to the third. But the second program expects a string, so that can't be. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe the actual sequence is different. Wait, perhaps the three Java programs are part of a chain where each's output is the next's input, but the way they are written, their inputs and outputs don't align. That would be a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended that the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, but their outputs and inputs are compatible? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (the count). The second program expects a string S as input. So that can't be. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the first Java code, it's printing a number. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the sequence is different. Alternatively, maybe the three Java programs are not to be run in sequence, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does all three steps in sequence, with the first reading input, the last producing output, and the intermediates passing data in memory. That makes more sense. Because otherwise, the outputs and inputs don't align. So the user probably wants to chain the three programs into a single Fortran program where the first part reads input, then processes through all three steps, with intermediate data passed in memory, and the final output is the result of the third step. That must be the case.\n\nSo the problem is to translate all three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same as running them in sequence, but without I/O in between. So the first Java program's input is read via Fortran's input, then its output (the count) is passed to the second program's processing (which would normally take a string S as input, but that's conflicting). Wait, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's setup? Because the three Java programs as given can't be connected in a sequence where each's output is the next's input. Let me check each program's input and output:\n\nFirst program (ABC166_C):\n\nInput: N (int), M (long), then N longs (H array). Then M pairs of integers.\n\nOutput: a single integer (ans2).\n\nSecond program (ABC164_D):\n\nInput: a string S (the next input after the first program's output is a number, which can't be a string).\n\nThird program (codeforces_579_A):\n\nInput: an integer n, which is the output of the second program (which outputs a number). So the third program takes that number and outputs the count of 1s in its binary.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the first program's output is a number (ans2), which is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string S as input. That's a conflict. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's setup? Or maybe the sequence is different. Alternatively, maybe the second program's input is the output of the first, but the second program's input is a string, so that can't be. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user intended that the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, but the outputs and inputs are not directly connected. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed as per the given instructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three Java programs are separate, and the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does all three in sequence, with the first reading input, the last producing output, and the intermediates passing data in memory. But the problem is that the second program's input is a string, which would have to come from the first program's output (a number). So that's impossible unless the first program's output is converted into a string. But the first program's output is a number, so perhaps the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\".\n\nAh, that's possible. So the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input string for the second program. Then the second program's output is a number, which is the input for the third program. So the third program takes that number and outputs the count of 1s in its binary.\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nInput to the entire sequence is the input for the first Java program (N, M, H array, etc.), then the first's output is a number, which is the input string for the second program (so the second program's S is that number as a string). Then the second's output is a number, which is the input for the third program, which outputs the count of 1s in its binary.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through all three steps, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (N, M, H array, then M pairs of integers).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans2).\n\n3. Use that ans2 as the input S for the second program (so S is the string representation of ans2).\n\n4. Compute the second program's result (the count of pairs).\n\n5. Use that count as the input n for the third program.\n\n6. Compute the third program's result (number of 1s in binary of n).\n\n7. Output that final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (N, M, H array, then M pairs).\n\n- Process through first step to get ans2.\n\n- Then process the second step using S = str(ans2).\n\n- Then process the third step using the second's output as n.\n\n- Finally, output the third's result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (equivalent to first Java program):\n\nRead N, M, then N H values (as integers, but in Java they are long, but in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes, so using integer*8 or similar if needed. But in Fortran, perhaps using integer*8 for H array.\n\nThen read M pairs of integers (temp1 and temp2). For each pair, compare H(temp1-1) and H(temp2-1) (since Java uses 0-based, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so need to adjust indices).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So need to be careful with indices.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the H array is 0-based (since for i from 0 to N-1, H[i] is set). The temp1 and temp2 are read as 1-based (since in Java code, they subtract 1 to get 0-based indices). So in Fortran, if we use 1-based arrays, then the indices would be temp1 and temp2 directly (since in Java, temp1-1 gives 0-based, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so temp1 would be the correct index).\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nIn Java code:\n\ntemp1 = sc.nextInt();\n\ntemp2 = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, comparing H[temp1-1] and H[temp2-1].\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the indices would be temp1 and temp2, so the code would be H(temp1) and H(temp2). Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the user inputs temp1 and temp2 as 1-based (since they subtract 1 to get 0-based). So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the indices would be temp1 and temp2 directly. So that's okay.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nRead N, M.\n\nAllocate H array of size N (1-based).\n\nRead N H values into H(1) to H(N).\n\nInitialize ans array (logical array of size N, all .true. initially).\n\nThen loop over M times:\n\nRead temp1 and temp2 (integers).\n\nCompare H(temp1) and H(temp2).\n\nIf H(temp1) < H(temp2), set ans(temp1) = .false.\n\nElse if H(temp1) > H(temp2), set ans(temp2) = .false.\n\nElse (equal), set both ans(temp1) and ans(temp2) to .false.\n\nThen count the number of .true. in ans array (ans2).\n\nThat's the first part's result.\n\nSecond part (equivalent to second Java program):\n\nThe input S is the string representation of ans2 (the first part's output). So in Fortran, we can convert ans2 to a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's steps:\n\nTake S as a string (the number from first part's output, e.g., if ans2 is 5, then S is \"5\").\n\nCompute N = length of S.\n\nInitialize mod_arr array of size N (1-based?), mod_cnt array of size 2019 (since mod 2019).\n\nInitialize radix = 1.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1 (since in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1, but in Fortran, indices start at 1, so perhaps need to adjust).\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ... S.charAt(N - 1 - i) ... \n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to N-1. The character is taken from the end of the string, moving backward. So for i=0, it's the last character (since N-1 -0 = N-1, which is the last index in Java's 0-based string). So in Fortran, the string is stored as a character array, perhaps.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see:\n\nSuppose S is a character string of length N. Then, in Fortran, the first character is S(1), last is S(N).\n\nIn the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1 (total N iterations). For each i, the character is at position N-1 -i (since Java's string is 0-based). So for i=0, it's the last character (position N-1 in Java, which is the last character). So in Fortran, the equivalent would be S(N - i) ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's S has length N. The first character is S[0], last is S[N-1].\n\nIn Fortran, the first character is S(1), last is S(N).\n\nSo for the Java code's S.charAt(N-1 -i), which is the (N-1 -i)th character in Java (0-based), which is the (N -i)th character in Fortran (1-based).\n\nSo in Fortran, the character is S(N - i).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's index: 0 to N-1.\n\nFortran's index: 1 to N.\n\nSo for a given i in Java (0-based), the equivalent Fortran index is i+1.\n\nSo in the Java code, the character at position (N-1 -i) is the (N-1 -i)th element in Java, which is the (N -i)th element in Fortran (since 1-based).\n\nSo in Fortran, the character is S(N - i).\n\nWait, but in the loop, i runs from 0 to N-1 (Java's i). So in Fortran, perhaps we can loop over i from 1 to N, but adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's have a loop variable j from 1 to N, and for each j, the position in the string is (N - j +1) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to reindex.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the loop in the second Java program:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ... S.charAt(N-1 -i) ... \n\nSo for each i from 0 to N-1, the character is at position (N-1 -i) in the string. So for i=0, it's the last character (position N-1 in Java, which is the last character). For i=1, it's N-2, etc., down to i=N-1, which is position 0 (the first character).\n\nSo the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is stored as S(1) to S(N). So the first character is S(1), last is S(N).\n\nSo to process the characters in reverse order (from last to first), we can loop from i = N down to 1, but perhaps in the code, the loop variable can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the loop can be over i from 1 to N, and for each i, the character is S(N - i +1). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor i=1, N -i +1 = N, which is the last character (correct).\n\nFor i=2, N-1, etc. So yes, that would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop in Fortran can be written as:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n    current_char = S(N - i +1)\n\n    ...\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the way to process the characters in reverse order.\n\nNow, the variables in the second program:\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N (Java's mod_arr has length N). mod_cnt is an array of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can declare them with 0-based if needed. For mod_cnt, since it's mod 2019, the indices can be 0 to 2018, so we can declare it as integer, dimension(0:2018).\n\nSimilarly, mod_arr is size N, so dimension(1:N).\n\nThe variables:\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019, where digit is the current character's numeric value (char - '0').\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\ntmp = ((int) S.charAt(...) - '0') * radix % 2019;\n\nThen, if i !=0 (since in Java's loop, i starts at 0, so for i=0, it's the first iteration, so the 'if' is false), then tmp is added to mod_arr[i-1], mod 2019.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\ntmp = ... \n\nif (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\nradix = radix *10 %2019;\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variable is i from 1 to N (since in Java it's 0-based up to N-1, so N elements). So in Fortran, the loop is over i from 1 to N.\n\nWait, let me re-express the Java code's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ... \n\n    if (i !=0) tmp += mod_arr[i-1]; \n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp % 2019;\n\n    mod_cnt[mod_arr[i]]++;\n\n    radix = (radix *10) %2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the code step by step.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\ntmp is computed as (digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nThen, if i is not 0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, then mod 2019.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) % 2019;\n\nif (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\nradix = (radix *10) %2019;\n\nWait, but the order of operations is important. Also, the radix is updated after each step.\n\nWait, the radix starts at 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n    compute digit (the current character's value)\n\n    compute tmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019\n\n    if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, then mod 2019 again.\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp mod 2019 (but already modded?)\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented.\n\n    then, update radix: radix = (radix *10) mod 2019.\n\nWait, the radix is multiplied by 10 each time, mod 2019.\n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize mod_arr(1:N), mod_cnt(0:2018) = 0.\n\nradix = 1\n\nmod_cnt(0) = 0 (initialized to zero, but will be updated)\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to N:\n\n    current_char = S(N - i +1)  ' the ith step corresponds to Java's i starting at 0, so for i=1 in Fortran, it's Java's i=0.\n\n    digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n    tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n    if (i >1) then  ' because in Java, if i !=0 (i starts at 0), so for Fortran's i=1, it's Java's i=0, so the condition is i>1 corresponds to Java's i !=0 when i is >=1 in Fortran.\n\n        tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n    mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n    radix = mod(radix *10, 2019)\n\nWait, but the initial value of mod_cnt is all zero. Wait, in the Java code, mod_cnt is initialized as new int[2019], which is all zeros. So in Fortran, we can initialize mod_cnt to zero.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the loop, mod_cnt is filled, and then the code does mod_cnt[0]++ before calculating the answer. Wait, looking back at the second Java program's code:\n\nAfter the loop over i, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, why? Let me check the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop, the code has:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n\n    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i] -1)/2;\n\n}\n\nWait, so the mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. That's because in the problem's logic, perhaps the empty substring is considered? Or maybe there's an off-by-one error. The code in Java is adding 1 to mod_cnt[0], which might be part of the algorithm.\n\nWait, the problem is to count the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[i..j] mod 2019 is 0. The approach uses the prefix sums mod 2019. The number of pairs is the number of pairs of indices where the mod values are equal. So the formula is for each value, the count of pairs is C(k,2) where k is the count of that mod value. But the code in Java is adding 1 to mod_cnt[0], which might be because the initial prefix (before any digits) is considered as 0 mod 2019. Let me think:\n\nThe algorithm uses the prefix array mod_arr where mod_arr[i] is the value of the substring S[0..i] mod 2019 (or something like that). The idea is that for two indices i < j, if mod_arr[j] - mod_arr[i] \u22610 mod 2019, then the substring from i+1 to j is divisible by 2019. So the number of such pairs is the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. However, the initial prefix (before any digits) is considered as 0 mod 2019. So the mod_cnt array should include this initial 0. Hence, in the code, after processing all the digits, they add 1 to mod_cnt[0], which represents the initial 0. So the code's approach is:\n\nmod_cnt starts as counts of mod values from the digits. Then, adding the initial 0 (so mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1), and then the total pairs are sum over all counts of C(k,2).\n\nHence, in Fortran, after the loop, we need to do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. So in Fortran, after the loop over i from 1 to N, we have to do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1.\n\nThen, the answer is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2).\n\nSo the second part's result is the computed ans.\n\nThird part (equivalent to third Java program):\n\nThe input is the second part's output (the ans from the second program). The third program takes that number, converts it to binary, counts the number of 1's.\n\nIn Fortran, to do this:\n\nTake the number (let's call it n), then count the number of 1 bits in its binary representation.\n\nThe third Java program does this by converting n to a string of its binary digits and counting the '1's. Alternatively, in Fortran, we can loop through the bits.\n\nThe steps in the third program:\n\nInitialize ans =0.\n\nWhile n >0:\n\n    ans += mod(n,2)\n\n    n = n /2\n\nSo the count is the sum of the bits.\n\nHence, in Fortran, we can do:\n\nans =0\n\ntemp = n\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    ans = ans + mod(temp,2)\n\n    temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nSo the final output is ans.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the input for the first part, process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read the first part's input:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nThen read N H values (as integers, but in Java they are long. Since in Fortran, integers can be 4 bytes, but if N is up to 1e5 or something, but the problem's constraints aren't given. Assuming that the H values can be stored as integers (or perhaps using integer*8 if needed, but let's see).\n\nWait, in the first Java program, H is declared as long[], so in Fortran, perhaps using integer*8 (8-byte integers) to match.\n\nBut in Fortran, the default integer is 4 bytes, but depending on the compiler, but to be safe, perhaps use integer*8 for H array.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn the first part's code:\n\nRead N, M.\n\nThen read N H values (each as long in Java, so in Fortran, integer*8).\n\nThen read M pairs of integers (temp1 and temp2).\n\nThen process the ans array (logical array of size N).\n\nThen count the number of true entries (ans2).\n\nThen, the second part's input is the string representation of ans2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing ans2, we need to convert it to a string S.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read, or using internal writes.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_str\n\nwrite(s_str, '(i0)') ans2\n\nThen, trim the string to remove leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to get the string.\n\nOnce S is obtained, process the second part.\n\nThen, the second part's output is the ans (the count of pairs), which is an integer.\n\nThen, the third part takes that ans as n, and counts the bits.\n\nNow, let's outline the code step by step.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: N, M, temp1, temp2, ans2, ans3, i, j, temp\n\ninteger*8, dimension(:), allocatable :: H\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: ans\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_str\n\ninteger :: mod_arr(1:N)  ' but N is variable, so need to use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we need to handle dynamic arrays. So perhaps:\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nAllocate H array of size N.\n\nRead N H values.\n\nAllocate ans array of size N, initialized to .true.\n\nThen process the M pairs.\n\nThen compute ans2.\n\nThen, convert ans2 to a string S.\n\nSecond part:\n\nCompute the length of S (N2 = len_trim(s_str)).\n\nAllocate mod_arr array of size N2.\n\nmod_cnt array of size 0:2018.\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0.\n\nradix =1.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to N2:\n\n    current_char = s_str(N2 -i +1: N2 -i +1)\n\n    digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n    ... compute tmp, etc.\n\nThen, after loop, mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1.\n\nCompute ans2_part (the second part's output).\n\nThird part:\n\nTake ans2_part as n.\n\nCompute the number of 1 bits.\n\nFinally, print the result.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before use, and arrays must be allocated.\n\nSo let's structure the code step by step.\n\nFirst, read the first part's input:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, M, temp1, temp2, ans2, ans3, i, j, temp\n\ninteger*8, allocatable :: H(:)\n\nlogical, allocatable :: ans(:)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_str\n\ninteger :: N2, mod_arr(1:200) ' but need to adjust for variable length.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use allocatable arrays for mod_arr and mod_cnt.\n\nWait, but mod_cnt is fixed size (0:2018).\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n\ninteger :: radix, current_digit, tmp, ans2_part\n\ninteger :: n_third, count_ones\n\n! First part:\n\nread*, N, M\n\nallocate(H(N))\n\nallocate(ans(N))\n\nread*, (H(i), i=1,N)\n\nans = .true.\n\ndo i=1,M\n\n    read*, temp1, temp2\n\n    if (H(temp1) < H(temp2)) then\n\n        ans(temp1) = .false.\n\n    else if (H(temp1) > H(temp2)) then\n\n        ans(temp2) = .false.\n\n    else\n\n        ans(temp1) = .false.\n\n        ans(temp2) = .false.\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nans2 = count(ans)\n\n! Convert ans2 to string S:\n\nwrite(s_str, '(i0)') ans2\n\ns_str = adjustl(s_str) ' to remove leading spaces\n\nN2 = len_trim(s_str)\n\n! Second part:\n\nallocate(mod_arr(N2))\n\nmod_cnt = 0\n\nradix =1\n\ndo i=1,N2\n\n    character(1) :: current_char\n\n    current_char = s_str(N2 -i +1: N2 -i +1)\n\n    current_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n    tmp = mod(current_digit * radix, 2019)\n\n    if (i >1) then\n\n        tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n    mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n    radix = mod(radix *10, 2019)\n\nend do\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nans2_part =0\n\ndo i=0,2018\n\n    ans2_part = ans2_part + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\n! Third part:\n\nn_third = ans2_part\n\ncount_ones =0\n\ntemp = n_third\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    count_ones = count_ones + mod(temp,2)\n\n    temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, count_ones\n\ndeallocate(H, ans, mod_arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some possible issues here.\n\nFirst, in the first part, when reading the H array, the read statement is read*, (H(i), i=1,N). That should work.\n\nIn the first part's loop over M pairs, the indices temp1 and temp2 are read as integers. Since in Java, they are 1-based (since the code subtracts 1 to get 0-based indices in Java's array), in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices are correct.\n\nThe ans array is initialized to .true. using ans = .true.\n\nThe count(ans) function counts the number of .true. elements, which is correct.\n\nThen converting ans2 to a string. The write statement writes to s_str, which is a character(len=20) variable. The adjustl is to remove leading spaces, but perhaps the write statement with '(i0)' already does that. However, in Fortran, when writing to a character variable with a format, leading spaces may be present if the number is shorter than the field. So using adjustl is safer.\n\nThen N2 is the length of the string.\n\nIn the second part's loop:\n\ncurrent_char is a single character from the string, taken in reverse order (since for i=1, it's the last character of the original string, etc.)\n\ncurrent_digit is the numeric value of the character.\n\ntmp is computed as (current_digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nIf i>1 (since in Java's loop, i starts at 0, so for i=0 (Fortran's i=1), the condition is false. So for i=2 in Fortran (Java's i=1), the condition is true.\n\nThen mod_arr(i) is set to tmp, and mod_cnt(tmp) is incremented.\n\nThen radix is updated.\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1.\n\nThen the ans2_part is computed as the sum over all mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2.\n\nThird part: n_third is ans2_part, then count the bits.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The mod_arr array must be allocated to size N2. Since N2 is the length of the string, which is up to the number of digits in ans2. Since ans2 can be up to N (from the first program's count), which could be up to 1e5 (if N is large), but in practice, the string length would be manageable.\n\n- The mod_cnt array is fixed size 0:2018, which is okay.\n\n- The third part's loop: temp is an integer, but n_third could be up to the maximum possible value of the second part's output. The second part's output is the number of pairs, which can be up to (mod_cnt[i]^2)/2 summed over all i. The maximum mod_cnt[i] could be up to N2 (the length of the string). So for a string of length 20 (if ans2 is up to 1e20, which is possible if N is large), then mod_cnt[i] could be up to 20, so the maximum ans2_part would be 20*19/2 *2019 \u2248 20^2 * 2000 ~ 8e5, which is within integer range (assuming 32-bit integers).\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\nIn the first part's loop over M pairs:\n\nThe code reads temp1 and temp2, then compares H(temp1) and H(temp2). The indices are correct because in Java, the user inputs 1-based indices (since they subtract 1 to get 0-based in Java's array). In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices are correct.\n\nIn the second part's loop:\n\nThe current_char is correctly taken from the reversed string.\n\nThe mod operations are done correctly.\n\nThe mod_cnt is initialized to zero before the loop.\n\nThe mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1 after the loop.\n\nThe third part's loop correctly counts the bits.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's loop, the mod_arr is allocated as (N2), which is correct.\n\nAlso, in the first part, the H array is of type integer*8, which is necessary because in Java it's a long (64-bit). So in Fortran, using integer*8 is correct.\n\nNow, the code should be written accordingly.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, when reading the H array, the read statement may need to read each element one by one, but using the implied do loop (read*, (H(i), i=1,N)) should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's input is \"0\", which is length 1. The second program would process that, and the third program would count the bits of the resulting ans2_part.\n\nAnother edge case: if the first program's output is 1, then the second program's S is \"1\", etc.\n\nOverall, this should work."
