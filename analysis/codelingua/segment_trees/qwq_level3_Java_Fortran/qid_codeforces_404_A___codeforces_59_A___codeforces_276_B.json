    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_404_A) reads an integer n, then n strings of length n. It checks if the characters on the diagonals are all the same (a) and the rest are another character (b). If so, it prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on conditions. The second program (codeforces_59_A) takes a word and converts it to uppercase or lowercase based on which case has more characters. The third (codeforces_276_B) counts the frequency of each character, checks how many have odd counts, and decides \"First\" or \"Second\" based on that.\n\nThe key is to chain them so the output of the first is input to the second, and the second's output is input to the third. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in the middle. So the first program's output (YES/NO) becomes the input for the second, which processes it and outputs another string (the converted word), which then becomes the input for the third, which outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program expects a word. So the first's output is the input for the second. Then the second's output (like \"Yes\" or \"NO\" converted to all lowercase or uppercase) is the input for the third. The third then processes that string.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps internally, and then output the final result of the third program.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (n and n strings).\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the result (YES/NO).\n3. Use that result as the input for the second program's processing (convert to upper/lower case).\n4. Take the result from the second step and process it through the third program's logic (count characters' frequencies, decide \"First\" or \"Second\").\n5. Finally, output the result of the third step.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (codeforces_404_A):\n\nThe first program reads n, then n strings. Each string is stored in an array, then converted into a 2D array of characters. Then checks diagonals and other elements.\n\nIn Fortran, I can read n, then read n lines, each of length n. Store them in a 2D character array. Then check the conditions.\n\nThe second program (codeforces_59_A) takes a string (the output from first), counts uppercase and lowercase letters, then converts the entire string to upper or lower case based on which count is higher, or lower if equal.\n\nThird program (codeforces_276_B) takes the resulting string from the second, counts each character's frequency, counts how many have odd counts. If oddCount is 0 or 1, or oddCount is even but more than 1? Wait, the condition in Java is: if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then \"First\", else \"Second\". Wait, let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at codeforces_276_B's condition:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2 !=0)) then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the original code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount % 2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount %2 !=0) ) \u2192 \"First\"\n\nWait, but oddCount can be even or odd. Let me see:\n\nSuppose oddCount is 3 \u2192 3 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf oddCount is 2 \u2192 2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 so condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) and (2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 so \"Second\".\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 \u2192 yes, then first. Or if oddCount is odd (since mod2 !=0 \u2192 so if oddCount is odd, then first. So for even counts greater than 1, if they are even, then if the count is even, but oddCount is even, then it's \"Second\".\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount is odd) ) \u2192 then first, else second.\n\nWait, because oddCount %2 !=0 \u2192 that's when it's odd. So the condition is true when oddCount is \u22641 or odd. So when is it false? When oddCount is even and greater than 1. So when oddCount is even and >1 \u2192 then output \"Second\".\n\nSo the third program's logic is: if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number, then first player wins. Else, if it's even and more than 1, second.\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to process all these steps in sequence without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let's structure the Fortran program.\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and n strings).\n\n2. Process the first's logic to get the first result (YES/NO).\n\n3. Take that result (a string) and process the second's logic (convert to upper/lower case).\n\n4. Take the result from step 3 and process the third's logic (count characters, decide first/second).\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about variables and data structures.\n\nFirst part variables:\n\n- n: integer.\n\n- arr: 2D character array of size n x n.\n\n- The first character a is arr(1,1) (since Fortran is 1-based), and b is arr(1,2).\n\nWait, in Java, the first program's code uses 0-based indices. So in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nchar a = arr[0][0]; // first element of first row.\n\nchar b = arr[0][1]; // second element of first row.\n\nIn Fortran, the first element is (1,1), so a would be arr(1,1), b is arr(1,2).\n\nThen, the check is whether a and b are the same. If so, output NO.\n\nElse, check all elements: if on the diagonals (i == j or i + j == n-1 (Java's 0-based)), then must be a. Else, must be b.\n\nWait, in Java, the condition for diagonals is:\n\nif (i == j || i + j == n -1).\n\nIn Fortran, since indices start at 1, the equivalent condition would be i == j or i + j == n +1 (since for 1-based, the sum for the anti-diagonal would be (i + j) = n+1).\n\nSo for each element (i,j):\n\nif (i == j) \u2192 main diagonal.\n\nor (i + j == n+1) \u2192 anti-diagonal.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the condition is correct.\n\nSo the first part's logic can be translated.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program takes the output string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and converts it to upper or lower case based on counts.\n\nWait, the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". So the input to the second program is that string. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first outputs \"YES\".\n\nThe second program counts uppercase and lowercase letters in \"YES\".\n\n\"YES\" has all uppercase letters. So uppercase count is 3, lowercase 0 \u2192 so output is uppercase \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nIf first outputs \"NO\", then \"NO\" has uppercase N and O? Wait, \"NO\" is uppercase? Wait, the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase? Let me check the Java code.\n\nYes, the first program's print statements are System.out.println(\"YES\") or \"NO\", so they are uppercase.\n\nSo the second program's input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nProcessing \"YES\": uppercase count is 3, lowercase 0 \u2192 so uppercase > lowercase \u2192 output \"YES\".\n\nProcessing \"NO\": uppercase count is 2, lowercase 0 \u2192 same \u2192 so output lowercase? Wait, the code says if uppercase > lowercase \u2192 uppercase, else if lowercase > uppercase \u2192 lowercase, else lowercase. So for \"NO\", uppercase is 2, lowercase 0 \u2192 uppercase is greater, so output \"NO\" (uppercase). Wait, but the code would output the same as input.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the converted word. Wait, the code for the second program is:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase \u2192 print word.toUpperCase()\n\nelse if lowercase > uppercase \u2192 print lowercase.\n\nelse \u2192 lowercase.\n\nSo for \"YES\", uppercase is 3, lowercase 0 \u2192 so uppercase > lowercase \u2192 output \"YES\" (since it's already uppercase).\n\nFor \"NO\", same \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nSo the second program's output is the same as the input in this case. Hmm, but maybe if the input was mixed, but in this case, the first program's output is all uppercase, so the second program's output is same as input.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output could be \"NO\" (all uppercase), so the second program's output is same. So the second program's output is the same as first's output here. But perhaps in other cases, but in this scenario, the first's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the second program's output is same.\n\nWait, but let's see: the second program's input is the first's output. So if first outputs \"YES\", then the second's output is \"YES\" (since uppercase count is 3, so uppercase > lowercase \u2192 output uppercase, which is same as input). Similarly for \"NO\".\n\nSo the second program's output is same as first's output here. So the third program's input is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Suppose first outputs \"NO\", then the second program's input is \"NO\". The uppercase count is 2, lowercase 0 \u2192 so uppercase is higher \u2192 output \"NO\" (uppercase). So same as input.\n\nThus, the second program's output is same as first's output in this case. So the third program's input is the same as first's output.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the second program's code is:\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) \u2192 output uppercase version of the word.\n\nElse if lowercase > uppercase \u2192 output lowercase.\n\nElse \u2192 lowercase.\n\nSo for \"YES\", uppercase is 3, lowercase 0 \u2192 uppercase > lowercase \u2192 output uppercase \u2192 which is same as input.\n\nFor \"NO\", same \u2192 output same.\n\nThus, the second program's output is same as first's output. So the third program's input is the same as first's output.\n\nWait, but that's only because the first's output is all uppercase. If the first's output had lowercase letters, then the second would change it. But in this case, the first's output is all uppercase, so the second program's output is same.\n\nTherefore, the third program's input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, the third program processes that string. Let's see:\n\nTake \"YES\" \u2192 characters Y, E, S.\n\nEach character's count is 1. So for each character, count is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 3 (since all counts are odd). 3 is odd \u2192 so condition (oddCount <=1 \u2192 no, but 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nFor \"NO\" \u2192 counts are N (1), O (1). So oddCount is 2 \u2192 even. Since 2 is greater than 1 and even \u2192 so condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) and (2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nWait, let's compute for \"NO\":\n\nThe string is \"NO\".\n\nCharacters: N and O, each appearing once. So counts are 1 and 1 \u2192 both odd. So oddCount is 2.\n\nThe condition for third program is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 \u2192 2 is not \u22641 \u2192 false) OR (oddCount mod2 !=0 \u2192 2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 false \u2192 so overall condition is false \u2192 so output \"Second\".\n\nSo the third program's output would be \"First\" if first's output was \"YES\", and \"Second\" if it was \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire sequence is \"First\" or \"Second\" based on whether the first program's output was \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the third program's code.\n\nWait, for \"YES\" \u2192 the counts are Y:1, E:1, S:1 \u2192 all odd. So oddCount is 3. Since 3 is odd \u2192 condition (3 mod2 !=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nFor \"NO\" \u2192 oddCount is 2 \u2192 even. So condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) and (2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\" if first program's output was \"YES\", else \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"First\" when the first program's condition is met (YES), else \"Second\".\n\nSo the Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the input for the first program (n and n strings).\n\nProcess the first's logic to get \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThen, process the second's logic (which in this case leaves it the same).\n\nThen process the third's logic, which will decide between \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nThus, the Fortran program can be written to do all that.\n\nNow, let's start coding.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n, then n strings each of length n.\n\nIn Fortran, character arrays can be declared as character(len=n) :: strings(n). But since each string is exactly length n, that's okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read n strings each of length n, we can read them into a 1D array of strings, each of length n.\n\nThen, the 2D array can be stored as a 2D character array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the 2D array can be declared as character(len=1) :: arr(n,n).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n, read the string, and then assign each character to arr(i,j).\n\nThen, check the first condition: a = arr(1,1), b = arr(1,2). If a == b, output is \"NO\".\n\nElse, check all elements. For each i,j:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n+1) \u2192 must be a.\n\nElse, must be b.\n\nIf all pass, then output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThen, the second step's processing is redundant here, but we have to do it as per the sequence.\n\nWait, but in code, even if the second step's output is same, we have to process it.\n\nWait, the second program's input is the first's output (a string). So in Fortran, after getting the first's result (yes/no), we need to process it through the second's logic.\n\nSo, for the second step:\n\nTake the first's result (a string, either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nCount uppercase and lowercase letters in that string.\n\nThen decide the converted string.\n\nBut since the first's output is all uppercase, the second's output is same.\n\nBut in code, we have to do this step.\n\nThen, the third step takes the second's output (same as first's output) and processes it.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter first step, we have a string (result1).\n\nProcess result1 through second's logic to get result2.\n\nThen process result2 through third's logic to get final result.\n\nNow, let's code each part.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n, then n strings.\n\nThen process the first's logic.\n\nSecond part:\n\nTake the first's result (result1), process to get result2.\n\nThird part:\n\nTake result2, process to get final result.\n\nNow, let's code each step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen read n strings, each of length n.\n\nWe can read them into a 1D array of strings:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: strings(n)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*,*) strings(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, create the 2D array:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: arr(n,n)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      arr(i,j) = strings(i)(j:j)\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, check a and b:\n\na = arr(1,1)\n\nb = arr(1,2)\n\nif (a == b) then\n\n   result1 = \"NO\"\n\nelse\n\n   res = .true.\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      do j = 1, n\n\n         if ( (i == j) .or. (i + j == n +1) ) then\n\n            if (arr(i,j) /= a) then\n\n               res = .false.\n\n               exit\n\n            end if\n\n         else\n\n            if (arr(i,j) /= b) then\n\n               res = .false.\n\n               exit\n\n            end if\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (.not. res) exit\n\n   end do\n\n   if (res) then\n\n      result1 = \"YES\"\n\n   else\n\n      result1 = \"NO\"\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length. So \"YES\" is 3 characters, \"NO\" is 2. So need to make sure that the result1 is stored properly. Maybe use a character variable of sufficient length, like 3.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable of length 3, since the maximum is \"YES\".\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when assigning, if the string is shorter, it's padded with spaces. Hmm, but in the second step, when processing, we need to handle the actual characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", it will be \"NO \" (with a space). But that might cause issues in the second step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", it's stored as \"NO\" (without space?), but in Fortran, when you assign a shorter string, it pads with spaces. So \"NO\" would be \"NO \" (with a space at the end). That could be a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can write it as \"NO\" (but in Fortran, the length is fixed, so it will be \"NO \".\n\nWait, but in the second step, when processing, the code counts uppercase and lowercase letters. The space would be considered lowercase? Or non-alphabetic?\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the input is the first's output, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\". So the second program's input is exactly those strings, without any spaces. So in Fortran, when storing \"NO\", we need to make sure that the string is exactly \"NO\" (without a trailing space).\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use a character array of length 3 for result1, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space?), but then in the second step, when processing, we can ignore trailing spaces? Or perhaps better to use a character variable with length 3, and when assigning \"NO\", we can do:\n\nresult1 = \"NO\"\n\nBut in Fortran, that would be \"NO\" followed by a space. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIf the variable is declared as character(len=3), then assigning \"NO\" would store 'N','O',' '.\n\nBut when processing in the second step, the length of the string is 3, but the actual content is \"NO \".\n\nWait, but the second program's code in Java uses the entire string, including any trailing spaces? Probably not, since the first program's output is \"NO\" (without space). So in Fortran, perhaps we need to handle the strings properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space?), but then in the second step, we can process only the first two characters. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can do:\n\nresult1 = \"NO\"\n\nBut in Fortran, the third character will be a space. Then, in the second step, when processing, the code will count the space as a lowercase character? That would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. To avoid this, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" followed by a space, but then in the second step, process only the first len_trim(result1) characters. But Fortran's len_trim gives the length of the string without trailing spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, process the entire string, but the space would be considered as a lowercase character (since it's a space, which is not uppercase or lowercase). Wait, in the second Java program, the code checks if the character is uppercase or lowercase. The space is neither, so it would be counted as lowercase? Or not counted?\n\nWait, in the second Java program's code:\n\nfor each character in the word:\n\nif Character.isUpperCase(ch) \u2192 count uppercase.\n\nElse \u2192 count lowercase.\n\nSo, for a space, it's not uppercase \u2192 so it's counted in lowercase.\n\nThus, in the case of \"NO \" (with a space), the lowercase count would be 1 (the space), so the total uppercase is 2 (N and O), lowercase is 1 (space). So uppercase (2) > lowercase (1) \u2192 output uppercase \u2192 \"NO \" (but the space is uppercase? No, the code converts the entire string to uppercase or lowercase. So \"NO \" \u2192 uppercase would be \"NO \" (the space remains a space). But the second program's output would be \"NO \" (with space), but the third program would process that.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. To avoid this, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, but when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" followed by a space, but then in the second step, process only the first two characters. Alternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, process the entire string, but the space would be considered as lowercase, which would affect the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, we can trim the trailing space before processing. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in trim function, but we can use len_trim.\n\nWait, in the second step, the input is the first's result. Let's see:\n\nIn the second step's processing:\n\nTake the first's result (result1), which is a string of length 3 (for \"YES\") or 3 (for \"NO\" with a space). Wait, \"NO\" is two characters, so stored as \"NO \" in a 3-length variable.\n\nSo, in the second step, the code must process the entire string, including the space. But in the original Java code, the first's output is \"NO\" (without space). So the second program's input is \"NO\", so the space is not present. Therefore, in Fortran, we need to ensure that the result1 is exactly \"YES\" or \"NO\" without trailing spaces.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (so the third character is a space). But then in the second step, we can process only the first two characters. Alternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, we can process the string up to the first non-space character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, we can use the len_trim function to get the actual length.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the len_trim function returns the length of the string without trailing blanks. So for \"NO \", len_trim would be 2.\n\nThus, in the second step's processing:\n\nWe can process each character up to len_trim(result1).\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: result1\n\n...\n\nThen, in the second step:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: result2\n\ninteger :: uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(result1)\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   ch = result1(i:i)\n\n   if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   else\n\n      ! non-alphabetic, perhaps ignore? Or count as lowercase?\n\n      ! According to Java code, non-alphabetic characters are considered lowercase?\n\n      ! In Java's Character.isUpperCase, non-letters return false, so they are counted in lowercase.\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, decide the result2:\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   result2 = adjustl(ucase(result1))\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   result2 = adjustl(lcase(result1))\n\nelse\n\n   result2 = adjustl(lcase(result1))\n\nend if\n\nWait, but Fortran has functions for uppercase and lowercase?\n\nWait, in Fortran, there are functions like char and ichar, but for converting to uppercase or lowercase, perhaps we can use the intrinsic functions.\n\nWait, Fortran 2003 has functions like uppercase and lowercase, but maybe in older versions, we can use the following approach.\n\nAlternatively, to convert a character to uppercase:\n\nif (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\n   ch = char(ichar(ch) - 32)\n\nend if\n\nSimilarly for lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to process each character in the string and build the new string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following approach for the second step:\n\nresult2 = result1\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(result1)\n\n      ch = result2(i:i)\n\n      if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) - 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(result1)\n\n      ch = result2(i:i)\n\n      if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(result1)\n\n      ch = result2(i:i)\n\n      if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nBut this requires handling each character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Fortran intrinsic functions:\n\nIn Fortran 2003, there are functions like uppercase and lowercase, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use the following:\n\nresult2 = adjustl(result1)\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   result2 = uppercase(result2)\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   result2 = lowercase(result2)\n\nelse\n\n   result2 = lowercase(result2)\n\nend if\n\nBut I think Fortran doesn't have these functions. So need to implement them manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following code for the second step:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: result2\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(result1)\n\nresult2 = '   '  ! Initialize to spaces\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   ch = result1(i:i)\n\n   if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n      if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) - 32)\n\n      else\n\n         result2(i:i) = ch\n\n      end if\n\n   else if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n      if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n      else\n\n         result2(i:i) = ch\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n         result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n      else\n\n         result2(i:i) = ch\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nresult2 = adjustl(result2)  ! Remove leading spaces?\n\nWait, but the original result1 may have trailing spaces, but after processing, the result2 would have the same length, but with the converted characters. However, the third step needs to process the entire string, including any trailing spaces? Or only the actual characters?\n\nHmm, but in the original Java code, the second program's input is exactly the first's output (without any trailing spaces). So in Fortran, we need to ensure that the result1 is stored without trailing spaces. So perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, but when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, process only the first two characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, process only the first two characters (since len_trim(result1) would be 2 for \"NO \").\n\nWait, len_trim(\"NO \") is 2, because the third character is a space. So in the second step's loop, we can loop from 1 to len_trim(result1).\n\nThus, the code for the second step would process only the first two characters for \"NO \".\n\nThen, when building result2, we can set it to the first two characters converted, and the third character remains a space, but when we output, we can trim it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character variable of length 3 for result2, and after processing, set it to the first len_trim(result1) characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third step will process the entire string, including trailing spaces, but in the original Java code, the third program's input is exactly the second's output (without spaces). So in Fortran, we need to ensure that the result2 is exactly the same as the second program's output.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nNow, moving to the third step.\n\nThe third step takes the result2 (which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\" with possible trailing spaces?), and processes it to count character frequencies.\n\nIn the third step's code:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in the string (result2).\n\nBut in Fortran, the string may have trailing spaces. So we need to process only the actual characters (up to len_trim(result2)).\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: result2\n\ninteger :: oddCount = 0\n\ntype :: char_count\n\n   character(len=1) :: ch\n\n   integer :: count = 0\n\nend type char_count\n\n! Or use an array to count.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible characters are limited, perhaps use a hash map-like structure.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is short (max length 3), we can process each character.\n\nFirst, create an array to count each character's frequency.\n\nWe can use a derived type or a simple array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array to track counts.\n\nLet me think of using a character array for counts.\n\nWe can have an array for each possible ASCII character, but that's memory-heavy. Alternatively, since the input is a string of up to 3 characters, we can process each character and count.\n\nInitialize a dictionary (like in Java's HashMap).\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps use an array of counts for each character present.\n\nAlternatively, for each character in the string (up to len_trim(result2)), we can count their occurrences.\n\nFirst, initialize a count for each character.\n\nWe can use a derived type array or a hash-like structure.\n\nAlternatively, since the characters are limited, we can use a character array to track counts.\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\nInitialize an array of counts for each possible character in the string.\n\nFirst, loop through each character in the string (up to len_trim(result2)), and for each character, increment its count.\n\nThen, loop through all characters that have been counted, and count how many have odd counts.\n\nAlternatively, here's the code:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: s = result2\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: counts(256) = 0  ! Assuming ASCII, 256 possible characters.\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   ch = s(i:i)\n\n   counts(ichar(ch)) = counts(ichar(ch)) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen, count how many counts are odd:\n\noddCount = 0\n\ndo i = 1, 256\n\n   if (counts(i) > 0) then\n\n      if (mod(counts(i),2) == 1) then\n\n         oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, decide the final result:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) ==1) then\n\n   final_result = \"First\"\n\nelse\n\n   final_result = \"Second\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 OR oddCount is odd) \u2192 then \"First\".\n\nWait, the condition in Java is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) /=0) ) then\n\n   final_result = \"First\"\n\nelse\n\n   final_result = \"Second\"\n\nend if\n\nThus, the third step's code can be written as above.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran program.\n\nThe program will have variables for each step.\n\nFirst, read n and the strings.\n\nThen process first step to get result1.\n\nThen process second step to get result2.\n\nThen process third step to get final_result.\n\nFinally, print final_result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, j, uppercase, lowercase, oddCount, len, counts(256), len_s\n\n   character(len=3) :: result1, result2, final_result\n\n   character(len=256) :: s  ! For third step's input (result2)\n\n   character(len=100) :: strings(100)  ! Assuming n up to 100, but better to use dynamic? But in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with fixed size.\n\nWait, but the first program's input is n and n strings of length n. So the maximum n can be up to, say, 100? Or maybe 1000? But in Fortran, we can't have dynamic arrays unless using allocatable arrays.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The first program's input is n and n strings of length n. So the 2D array needs to be n x n. But in Fortran, without allocatable arrays, we can't declare it unless we know n in advance.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the Java programs are given, and we have to translate them into a single Fortran program. So the input is the same as the original Java programs. So the first program's input is n followed by n strings of length n.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we need to read n first, then read n strings of length n.\n\nBut in Fortran, to read variable-length strings, we can use a character array with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of length, say, 1000, and read each string into it, then take the first n characters.\n\nWait, but the strings are exactly length n. So for each string, we can read it into a character variable of length n, but since n is variable, this is tricky.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. In Fortran, arrays must have fixed sizes at compile time unless using allocatable arrays.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to use allocatable arrays.\n\nThus, the program should use allocatable arrays.\n\nLet me adjust the code to use allocatable arrays.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, j, k, uppercase, lowercase, oddCount, len_s\n\n   character(len=3) :: result1, result2, final_result\n\n   character(len=1), allocatable :: arr(:,:)\n\n   character(len=1000) :: temp_str  !

Output the final result\n\n   print *, trim(final_result)\n\n   deallocate(arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some issues here.\n\nFirst, in the first step, when assigning result1 to \"YES\" or \"NO\", since it's a character(len=3), \"YES\" is exactly 3 characters, so no problem. \"NO\" is two characters, so stored as \"NO \" (with a space). But in the second step, when processing, len_trim(result1) is 2 for \"NO \".\n\nThe second step's processing converts the characters correctly.\n\nThen, in the third step, the string s is set to result2, which after processing the second step, for \"NO\", it would be \"NO \" (if uppercase is chosen, but since uppercase count is 2, lowercase is 0 \u2192 uppercase > lowercase \u2192 so result2 is \"NO \" (uppercase). But the space is still there. However, in the third step's processing, the space is counted as a character.\n\nWait, the space's ASCII code is 32. So in the counts array, counts(32) would be 1 for \"NO \".\n\nBut in the original Java code, the third program's input is \"NO\" (without space), so the space is not present. Thus, the Fortran code's processing includes the space, which is incorrect.\n\nThis is a problem. To fix this, we need to ensure that the result1 is stored without trailing spaces.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use a character(len=3) for result1, but when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, process only the first two characters, and in the third step, also process only the first two characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character(len=3) for result1, and when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, when building result2, we can also set it to the first two characters.\n\nWait, in the second step's code above, when converting to uppercase or lowercase, the loop runs up to len_s (which is 2 for \"NO \"). Thus, the third character (space) is not processed, so it remains a space. Thus, the result2 would be \"NO \" (with space).\n\nThus, in the third step, the string s is \"NO \" (with space), so the space is counted as a character.\n\nThis would lead to an incorrect count.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps in the first step, when storing \"NO\", we can set it to \"NO\" (with a space), but in the second step, after processing, we can trim the result2 to remove trailing spaces.\n\nAlternatively, in the second step's code, after processing, we can set result2 to the first len_s characters (without the trailing space).\n\nWait, in the second step's code:\n\nresult2 is initialized as result1 (which is \"NO \").\n\nThen, after processing, the first two characters are converted, but the third remains a space.\n\nThus, the result2 is \"NO \" (with space).\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps after processing, we can set result2 to the first len_s characters.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length. So perhaps after processing, we can do:\n\nresult2 = adjustl(result2)\n\nThis would move the non-space characters to the left, but for \"NO \", it would become \"NO \" (since the space is after the 'O').\n\nHmm, no. adjustl moves leading blanks to the end. So \" NO \" becomes \"NO \".\n\nWait, adjustl(\"NO \") would be \"NO \" (since there are no leading blanks).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following:\n\nresult2 = trim(result2)\n\nBut trim removes trailing blanks. So \"NO \" becomes \"NO\".\n\nAh! Yes, trim(result2) would remove the trailing space.\n\nThus, in the second step's code, after processing, we can set:\n\nresult2 = trim(result2)\n\nSo modifying the second step's code:\n\n...\n\n   else\n\n      do i = 1, len_s\n\n         character :: ch = result2(i:i)\n\n         if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n\n            result2(i:i) = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   result2 = trim(result2)  ! Remove trailing spaces\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the result2 is a character(len=3) variable. Trimming it would give a string without trailing spaces, but stored in a 3-character variable. So \"NO\" would be stored as \"NO \" (with a space at the end), but trim(result2) would return \"NO\", but when stored back into result2 (which is length 3), it would be \"NO \" again.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use a temporary variable.\n\nAlternatively, after processing, set:\n\nresult2 = trim(result2)\n\nBut in Fortran, when assigning to a character variable, it pads with spaces. So:\n\nresult2 = trim(result2)\n\nwould set result2 to the trimmed string, padded with spaces to length 3.\n\nThus, \"NO\" would be stored as \"NO \".\n\nBut when passed to the third step, the len_trim(result2) would be 2, so the third step's processing would only consider the first two characters.\n\nWait, in the third step's code:\n\ns = result2\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nThus, len_s would be 2 for \"NO \".\n\nThen, the loop runs from 1 to 2, so the space is not counted.\n\nThus, the space is not counted in the third step's processing.\n\nAh, that's correct.\n\nThus, the third step's processing will only consider the first two characters (for \"NO \").\n\nThus, the counts will be correct.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nNow, let's check the third step's code.\n\nIn the third step:\n\ns = result2 \u2192 which is \"YES\" (trimmed to 3 characters, so no space?), or \"NO\" (trimmed to 2 characters, stored as \"NO \").\n\nWait, for \"YES\", the result1 is \"YES\" (3 characters, no trailing space?), because when stored in a 3-character variable, it's exactly \"YES\".\n\nThus, len_trim(result1) is 3 for \"YES\".\n\nThus, the third step's processing for \"YES\" will process all three characters.\n\nThus, the counts for Y, E, S are each 1 \u2192 oddCount is 3 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nFor \"NO\", the result2 is \"NO \" (but after trim, it's \"NO\", stored as \"NO \" in a 3-character variable. So len_trim(result2) is 2 \u2192 thus, the third step processes the first two characters (N and O), each count 1 \u2192 oddCount is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 so condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) and (2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 no \u2192 so output \"Second\".\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the final code.\n\nAlso, in the first step's code, when assigning result1 to \"YES\" or \"NO\", we need to ensure that the strings are properly stored.\n\nFor \"YES\", it's 3 characters \u2192 stored as \"YES\".\n\nFor \"NO\", it's 2 characters \u2192 stored as \"NO \".\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, the code also needs to handle the case where the first program's output is \"NO\".\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's write the final Fortran code with all these considerations."
