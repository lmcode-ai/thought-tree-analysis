So if the input is, say, \"AB CD\", then in.next() would read \"AB\", and the rest would be ignored. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is passed to the second, so the input to the first program must be a single token (since the second program expects a line of numbers). So the user's input is a single string (without spaces?), so that in.next() reads the entire string. So in Fortran, to read the entire line (assuming it's a single token), we can read a line into a character variable. Wait, but in Fortran, to read a line, you can use:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)')",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string from input. It checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, it outputs \"Yes\"; else \"No\". But wait, the next program uses this output as input. Wait, but the second Java program (atcoder_ABC170_A) reads input as a list of numbers, splits by space, counts until it hits a 0, then outputs the count. Hmm, so the first program's output must be the input for the second. But the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Wait, but the second program expects numbers separated by spaces. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string. The second program expects input as a list of numbers, split by spaces. So how does that work? Unless the first program's output is being used as the input for the second, but \"Yes\" or \"No\" can't be split into numbers. That suggests maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the original input, and its output is passed to the second, which then processes it, and so on. But the second program's input is a list of numbers. So maybe the first program's output is a string that the second program can process as numbers? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the original input, and the second program's input is the output of the first. But the first's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which can't be split into numbers. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is a string that contains both 'A' and 'B', and the second program's input is the same as the first's input? But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the actual problem statements of these AtCoder problems to see what they do. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program is expecting numbers. That would be a problem unless the first's output is a number. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the code.\n\nLooking at the first Java program again: the first program's input is a string (from in.next()), which is read as a single token. So the input is a single string. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is read via BufferedReader, which reads a line, splits into an array of strings (split by space), then counts the number of elements until a \"0\" is found. So the input to the second program must be a line of space-separated numbers, ending with a 0. But the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which can't be split into numbers. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but maybe the first program's input is the original input, and the second program's input is the same as the first's input? But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is being used as the input to the second, but the second program is expecting numbers. That would mean that the first program's output must be a sequence of numbers. But \"Yes\" and \"No\" are not numbers. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look at the actual problem statements for these AtCoder problems to see what they do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string that the second program can process. Let me think again. The second program's code:\n\nSecond program (ABC170_A):\n\nIt reads a line, splits into an array of strings, then counts how many elements until a \"0\" is found. So the input must be a line of space-separated strings, which are numbers. The output is the count of elements until the first \"0\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". So if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\", which when split by space is [\"Yes\"], so the count would be 1 (since it's not 0). But \"Yes\" is not a number. Wait, but the second program is expecting numbers, but the input could be any strings. The code just counts until it hits a \"0\" string. So if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\", so the array is [\"Yes\"], so the loop adds 1, then checks if \"0\".equals(str). Since \"Yes\" is not \"0\", so the count is 1. So the second program would output 1. Then the third program would take that 1 as input?\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nThird program (ABC129_E):\n\nIt reads a line as a string, converts to a char array, and does some DP based on the characters. The input must be a string of characters (like a sequence of 0s and 1s?), and the output is a number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a number (like 1). But the third program expects a string of characters. So the second program's output is a number (like 1), which is then the input to the third program. The third program would read that as a string, like \"1\", and process it as a single character. So the third program would process the string \"1\", which is length 1. The DP would then compute based on that.\n\nHmm, okay, so the sequence is:\n\nOriginal input -> first program (outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\") -> second program (takes that string, splits into parts, counts until 0, outputs count) -> third program (takes that count as a string, processes it as a character array, and outputs the DP result).\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the count, which is an integer. So when the third program reads it, it's a single number, like \"1\" or \"2\", etc. So the third program's input is that number as a string. So the third program's code would read that as a string, like \"1\", and process it as a single character. So the third program's input is the count from the second program, which is a number, so the third program's input is a string representation of that number.\n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nInput to first program is a string (from user). First program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond program takes that output (the \"Yes\" or \"No\" string) as its input. It splits into tokens (split by space). Since \"Yes\" has no spaces, it's one token. Then counts how many tokens until a \"0\" is found. Since \"Yes\" is not \"0\", the count is 1. So the second program outputs 1. If the first program output was \"No\", then the count is 1 again (since \"No\" is not \"0\"). Wait, unless the first program's output is \"0\", but that's not possible because the first program's output is only \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" only if the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Otherwise \"No\". So the second program's input is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program's output is 1 in either case, because the first token is not \"0\". So the third program's input is \"1\", so the third program processes the string \"1\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code is expecting a string of characters (like a sequence of 0s and 1s?), but in this case, the input is \"1\", so the char array is ['1'], and the DP is computed based on that.\n\nHmm, okay. So the Fortran program must replicate this sequence.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps without I/O in between. The first step reads the input, the second and third steps process the data in memory, and the last step writes the final output.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\nFirst Java program (File 1):\n\nInput: a string (from user). Let's call this S1.\n\nOutput: \"Yes\" if S1 contains both 'A' and 'B', else \"No\".\n\nSecond Java program (File 2):\n\nInput: the output of first program (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nProcessing: split into tokens (split by space). The tokens are [\"Yes\"] or [\"No\"]. Then count the number of tokens until a \"0\" is found. Since neither \"Yes\" nor \"No\" is \"0\", the count is 1. So output is 1.\n\nWait, but the code in the second program is:\n\nfor (String str : input_array) {\n    result +=1;\n    if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n}\n\nSo it increments the count for each element until it hits a \"0\". So for input \"Yes\", the array has one element, which is \"Yes\", so result becomes 1, and since it's not \"0\", the loop continues, but there are no more elements. So the result is 1. Similarly for \"No\".\n\nSo the second program's output is 1 in either case.\n\nThird program (File 3):\n\nInput: the output of the second program, which is \"1\".\n\nProcessing: the input is read as a string (since the second program outputs an integer, but in Java, it's written as a string via PrintWriter.println, so the output is \"1\\n\").\n\nThe third program reads this as a line, converts to a char array. The string is \"1\", so the char array is ['1'].\n\nThe DP is computed based on this string. Let's see the code:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nchar[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();\nint n = s.length;\nint[][] dp = new int[n+1][2];\ndp[0][0] = 1;\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n    } else {\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n    }\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n    } else {\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n    }\n}\nSystem.out.println( (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M );\n\nWait, this code has some nested conditions. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nFirst part of the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nThen, after that, there's another if-else:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    ... \n} else {\n    ... \n}\n\nWait, the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, check s[i] == '0' and set dp[i+1][0] and [1] accordingly.\n\nThen, check s[i] == '0' again, and do some more operations.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe first block:\n\nif (s[i] is '0'):\n\n    set dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the previous values (so no change except for the next part?)\n\nElse:\n\n    set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M.\n\nThen, the second block:\n\nif (s[i] is '0'):\n\n    add (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nElse:\n\n    add (dp[i][0] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod both.\n\nWait, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to restructure the code.\n\nThe code for the first part:\n\nFirst part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first block sets dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the previous values. Then, in the second part, since s[i] is '0', it adds (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first block sets dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1]. Then in the second part, since s[i] is '0', the code adds (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], so the total becomes dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2) mod M? Wait, but mod is applied after each step.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should re-express the code in pseudocode to understand better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with some redundancy. Let me see:\n\nThe first part of the loop:\n\nFor each character s[i], first handle the first condition (s[i] is 0 or not), then handle the second condition (s[i] is 0 or not again). So the code is doing two separate checks for s[i] being '0'.\n\nThis might be a mistake in the code, but since it's given, I have to replicate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, the first part sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part adds some more terms based on s[i].\n\nBut regardless, I need to translate this into Fortran.\n\nNow, the problem is to combine all three steps into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the input string (from user) into a variable.\n\n2. Process it through the first program's logic (check for 'A' and 'B').\n\n3. The result of step 2 is the string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n4. Then, process this string through the second program's logic (split into tokens, count until 0, output count).\n\n5. The result of step 4 is the integer 1 (since neither \"Yes\" nor \"No\" is \"0\").\n\n6. Then, process this integer (as a string \"1\") through the third program's logic (the DP calculation).\n\n7. Output the final result of the third program.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n- Check if it contains both 'A' and 'B' \u2192 result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n- Then, process this string as the input for the second step: split into tokens (split by spaces), count until a \"0\" is found \u2192 count is 1.\n\n- Then, take that count (1) as a string (since the second program outputs it as a number, so the third program's input is \"1\").\n\n- Process this \"1\" string through the third program's DP.\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first step: checking for 'A' and 'B' in the input string.\n\nIn Fortran, to check if a string contains a character, we can loop through each character and check.\n\nSecond step: the input is the first step's output (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"). Split into tokens (split by space). Since there are no spaces, the array has one element. Then count until a \"0\" is found. Since the element is not \"0\", the count is 1.\n\nThird step: the input is \"1\", so the third program's processing is on the string \"1\".\n\nNow, the third program's DP is a bit complex. Let's see:\n\nThe third program's input is a string (the output of the second program, which is \"1\").\n\nThe code for the third program:\n\nThe DP array is (n+1) x 2, where n is the length of the input string.\n\nInitialize dp(0,0) = 1, others 0.\n\nThen for each character in the string (each i from 0 to n-1):\n\nFirst part:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, second part:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M \u2192 then mod again.\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M \u2192 mod again.\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M \u2192 mod again.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is not '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M. Then in the second part, since s[i] is not '0', the else clause adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], then mod.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is not '0', the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0? Or is there an initial value?\n\nWait, in the first part, for the first case (s[i] is '0'), the first part sets both dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the previous values. But in the else case (s[i] not '0'), the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0? Or is there an initial value?\n\nWait, in the code, the first part is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nSo in the else case, the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before (probably 0, since arrays are initialized to 0 in Java). Wait, but in Java, the arrays are initialized to 0, so the first part for the else case leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0, and sets dp[i+1][1] to the sum.\n\nThen, in the second part of the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is not '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (sum). Then in the second part, since s[i] is not '0', the else clause adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, but the first part's else clause only sets dp[i+1][1], so the dp[i+1][0] is 0 (since it was initialized to 0 in the array). Then, in the second part's else clause, we add (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], so that becomes (0 + (dp[i][0] *2)) mod M?\n\nWait, but the code in the second part's else clause is:\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M \u2192 but in Java, the += operator would add to the current value. Since dp[i+1][0] was set to 0 in the first part (because in the first part's else clause, it wasn't set), then adding (dp[i][0] *2 mod M) would set it to that value.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but I need to replicate this in Fortran.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n2. Check if it contains both 'A' and 'B' \u2192 result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Process this string through the second step's logic (count until 0 \u2192 1).\n\n4. Take that count (1) as a string (since the second program outputs it as a number, so the third program's input is \"1\").\n\n5. Process the string \"1\" through the third program's DP.\n\n6. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the input string:\n\nIn Fortran, to read a line from stdin, we can use a character array and read with an asterisk.\n\nBut since the first program's input is a single token (using in.next()), which in Java reads the next token (split by whitespace). Wait, the first Java program uses in.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So the input is a single token (the entire line if there's no whitespace?), but in the problem's context, perhaps the input is a single string (like \"AB\" or \"ABC\").\n\nWait, the first Java program's code uses in.next(), which reads the next token. So if the input is, say, \"AB CD\", then in.next() would read \"AB\", and the rest would be ignored. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is passed to the second, so the input to the first program must be a single token (since the second program expects a line of numbers). So the user's input is a single string (without spaces?), so that in.next() reads the entire string.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read the entire line (assuming it's a single token), we can read a line into a character variable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, to read a line, you can use:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut need to make sure to read until the end of line.\n\nAlternatively, using a list-directed read with an asterisk:\n\nread(*,*) input_str\n\nBut that might stop at whitespace. Hmm, perhaps better to read the entire line as a string.\n\nAlternatively, use a format that reads the entire line.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with a large enough size and read the line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's input is a single token (without spaces), so the Fortran code can read it as a single string.\n\nSo step 1: Read the input string.\n\nThen, check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, to check if a character is present in a string, we can loop through each character.\n\nFunction to check presence of 'A' and 'B':\n\nlogical function hasAandB(s) result(res)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n    logical :: hasA, hasB\n    hasA = .false.\n    hasB = .false.\n    integer :: i\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        if (s(i:i) == 'A') hasA = .true.\n        if (s(i:i) == 'B') hasB = .true.\n    end do\n    res = hasA .and. hasB\nend function\n\nThen, the first step's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo after checking, we can set first_output = \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond step: process this first_output string.\n\nThe second step's input is the first_output string. The second program splits into tokens (split by space), then counts until a \"0\" is found.\n\nSince the first_output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which have no spaces, the tokens array has one element. The count is 1, since the first element is not \"0\".\n\nSo the second step's output is 1.\n\nThird step: the input is the string \"1\".\n\nNow, processing this through the third program's DP.\n\nThe third program's input is the string \"1\".\n\nThe code for the third step's processing:\n\nThe input string is \"1\", so length is 1.\n\nInitialize dp array. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, it's 0-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is (n+1) rows (0 to n) and 2 columns (0 and 1).\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use a 2D array with indices from 1 to n+1 and 1 to 2.\n\nInitialize dp(1,1) = 1, dp(1,2) = 0 (since in Java, dp[0][0] =1, others 0).\n\nWait, in Java:\n\ndp[0][0] =1, dp[0][1] =0.\n\nThen for i from 0 to n-1 (Java's loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++) ), so in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to n (since the string length is n).\n\nWait, let's think in terms of Fortran indices.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s_char_array(n) \u2192 but in the third step's input is \"1\", so n=1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the third program's code, the input is read as a string, then converted to a char array. The length is n = len_trim(s).\n\nIn Fortran, the input string is \"1\", so n=1.\n\nThe DP array is (n+1) rows (0 to n in Java, so 1 to n+1 in Fortran?), and 2 columns.\n\nLet me define in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\ninteger :: n\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: third_input_str\n\nthird_input_str = '1'  ! from the second step's output (count is 1)\n\nn = len_trim(third_input_str)\n\nallocate(dp(0:n, 1:2))  ! since in Java it's 0-based, so 0 to n rows.\n\ndp(0,1) = 1  ! dp[0][0] in Java is 1.\n\ndp(0,2) = 0\n\nThen loop over each character in the string (from 1 to n in Fortran, since the string is 1-based? Or 0-based? Hmm, in Fortran, strings are 1-based by default.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the first character of a string is at position 1.\n\nSo for the third_input_str, which is \"1\", the first character is at position 1.\n\nSo the loop would be from i=1 to n (since n is 1 here).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++), so in Java, the indices go from 0 to n-1 (for the characters). So in Fortran, the loop would be over i from 1 to n (since the string is 1-based), and the current character is third_input_str(i:i).\n\nWait, let me re-express the loop in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    current_char = third_input_str(i:i)\n\n    ... process current_char ...\n\nend do\n\nNow, for each i (from 1 to n):\n\nFirst part of the loop (the first if-else):\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)  ! dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]\n\n    dp(i,2) = dp(i-1,2)  ! dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1]\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i-1,1) + dp(i-1,2), M )\n\n    ! dp[i][1] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1]) mod M\n\n    ! but in Fortran, the indices are shifted.\n\nWait, in Java, dp[i+1][1] is set here. Wait, no, in the Java code, the first part is for the current character s[i], and the code is setting dp[i+1][0] and [1].\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1 (the indices of the char array). The current character is s[i], and the code is updating dp[i+1][...]\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n (the current character is third_input_str(i:i)), the corresponding Java index is i-1 (since Java starts at 0). So the Fortran's i corresponds to Java's i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the current step.\n\nLet me re-express the first part of the loop in Fortran:\n\ncurrent_char = third_input_str(i:i)\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n    dp(i,2) = dp(i-1,2)\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i-1,1) + dp(i-1,2), M )\n\nend if\n\nThen, the second part of the loop:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M ), M )\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the first part of the loop, when current_char is not '0', the first part sets dp(i,2) (which is dp[i][1] in Java's terms) to the sum. Then in the second part, since current_char is not '0', the else clause adds (dp[i-1][0] *2) to dp[i][0], and (dp[i-1][1] *2) to dp[i][1].\n\nWait, in the second part's else clause:\n\nIn Fortran terms:\n\ndp(i,1) += (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M) \u2192 but in the first part, when current_char is not '0', the first part didn't set dp(i,1). So dp(i,1) remains as whatever it was before (which was 0, since arrays are initialized to 0? Or not?)\n\nWait, in the Fortran code, the dp array is initialized with dp(0,1)=1, dp(0,2)=0. The rest are initialized to 0?\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you allocate an array, it's initialized to 0. So dp is allocated as (0:n, 1:2). So dp(0,1)=1, dp(0,2)=0. The other elements (like dp(1,1), etc.) are 0 until set.\n\nSo in the first part of the loop, when current_char is not '0', the first part sets dp(i,2) to the sum. The dp(i,1) remains 0 (since it wasn't set in the first part).\n\nThen, in the second part's else clause (current_char is not '0'):\n\ndp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M)\n\nBut dp(i,1) was 0, so it becomes (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M).\n\nWait, but in the first part, when current_char is not '0', the first part's else clause only sets dp(i,2). The dp(i,1) remains 0.\n\nSo in the second part's else clause, the code adds (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M) to dp(i,1). So the new value is (0 + (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M)) mod M.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first part's else clause sets dp[i+1][1] (Java's index) to the sum, and the second part's else clause adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1].\n\nSo in Fortran terms, for the second part's else clause:\n\ndp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M) \u2192 but wait, no, the first term is dp[i-1][0] (Java's dp[i][0] is Fortran's dp(i-1,1) ? Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the indices carefully.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the current character is s[i], and the code is updating dp[i+1][...]\n\nIn Fortran, for the current character at position i (1-based), the previous step is i-1 (Java's i is i-1 in Fortran's terms).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the current i in Fortran corresponds to Java's i.\n\nWait, let me re-express the Java code's variables:\n\nJava's loop variable i runs from 0 to n-1 (for the characters in s).\n\nThe current character is s[i].\n\nThe code updates dp[i+1][...]\n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable i runs from 1 to n (for the characters in third_input_str).\n\nThe current character is third_input_str(i:i).\n\nThe code updates dp[i][...] (since in Fortran, the next step is i, corresponding to Java's i+1).\n\nSo the first part of the loop in Fortran:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n    dp(i,2) = dp(i-1,2)\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i-1,1) + dp(i-1,2), M )\n\nend if\n\nThen the second part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M ), M )\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the second part's else clause, the first term is adding (dp[i-1][0] *2) to dp[i][0], which in Fortran is dp(i-1,1) *2 added to dp(i,1).\n\nYes, because dp[i][0] in Java is dp(i,1) in Fortran (since Java's dp is 0-based, and Fortran's is 1-based for the rows).\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nJava's dp[i][0] corresponds to Fortran's dp(i,1).\n\nBecause in Java, the first dimension is 0-based (0 to n), and in Fortran, the first dimension is 1-based (0 to n would be 1 to n+1? Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, the array is declared as dp(0:n, 1:2), so the first dimension is from 0 to n (inclusive). So for Java's dp[i][0], it's exactly dp(i,1) in Fortran (since the second dimension is 1 for 0 in Java).\n\nWait, the second dimension in Java is 0 and 1, so in Fortran, the second dimension is 1 and 2. So Java's dp[i][0] is Fortran's dp(i,1), and dp[i][1] is dp(i,2).\n\nSo the second part's else clause in Java:\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 in Fortran, this is dp(i,1) += mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M )\n\nSimilarly, dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 dp(i,2) += mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nelse\n\n    temp1 = mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M )\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + temp1, M )\n\n    temp2 = mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\n    dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + temp2, M )\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the += operator is not available, so we have to write it as:\n\ndp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M ), M )\n\nSimilarly for the other terms.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, after processing all characters, the final result is (dp(n,1) + dp(n,2)) mod M.\n\nSo the final output is this value.\n\nNow, putting all steps into Fortran code.\n\nThe overall steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string (from user).\n\n2. Check if it contains both 'A' and 'B' \u2192 first_output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Process first_output through second step's logic \u2192 count is 1.\n\n4. Take count as a string \"1\".\n\n5. Process \"1\" through third step's DP \u2192 compute the result.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nFirst, the first step:\n\nRead the input string:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nThen, check for 'A' and 'B':\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n    if (input_str(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n        hasA = .true.\n\n    else if (input_str(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n        hasB = .true.\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n    first_output = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    first_output = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nSecond step: process first_output.\n\nThe second step's input is first_output. The second program's logic is to split into tokens (split by space), then count until a \"0\" is found.\n\nSince first_output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which has no spaces, the tokens array has one element. The count is 1.\n\nSo second_output = 1.\n\nThird step: process second_output as a string \"1\".\n\nSo third_input_str = \"1\"\n\nThen compute the DP.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\ninteger, parameter :: M = 100000007\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: third_input_str = \"1\"\n\ninteger :: n = len_trim(third_input_str)\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n, 1:2) :: dp\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,1) = 1\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    character(len=1) :: current_char = third_input_str(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n        dp(i,2) = dp(i-1,2)\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i-1,1) + dp(i-1,2), M )\n\n    end if\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M ), M )\n\n        dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M ), M )\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\ninteger :: result = mod( dp(n,1) + dp(n,2), M )\n\nprint *, result\n\nPutting all together in a single program.\n\nBut need to make sure that the variables are properly declared and the steps are in order.\n\nNow, putting it all into code.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based indices by declaring the array with lower bound 0.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=1000) :: input_str\n    logical :: hasA, hasB\n    integer :: i, n_third, result\n    character(len=100) :: first_output, third_input_str\n    integer, parameter :: M = 100000007\n\n    !
