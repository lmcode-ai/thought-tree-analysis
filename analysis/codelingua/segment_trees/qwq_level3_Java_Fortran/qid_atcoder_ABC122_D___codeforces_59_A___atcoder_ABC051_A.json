The final count is the sum of all possible last three codes' counts at current=N.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, the base case is when current == N, return 1. So the memo[N][code] is the number of ways to reach that state with length N. So the total is the sum over all codes of memo[N][code]. Wait, in the Java code's dfs function, when current == N, it returns 1. So each path that reaches current=N contributes 1 to the total. So the total is the sum of all memo[N][code] values. Therefore, the final result is sum_{code=0 to 63} memo(N, code). So after filling the memo array, we compute the total as the sum of all entries in memo(N, :). Now, the first part is done.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first Java program reads from stdin, the second takes the first's output, and the third takes the second's output. The final Fortran program should do all three steps in sequence without any intermediate I/O except for the first and last steps.\n\nFirst, let me understand each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nStarting with the first Java file (atcoder_ABC122_D). It's a dynamic programming problem, probably counting some valid strings with constraints. The input is an integer N, and it outputs a number modulo 1e9+7. The main function reads N and calls calc(), which uses a recursive DFS with memoization. The isOK function checks if a 4-character string (last3 plus the new character) is valid, avoiding \"AGC\" in any form, even after swapping adjacent characters. The memoization is done with an array of maps.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_59_A) takes a word and converts it to all uppercase or lowercase based on which case has more letters. If equal, it goes lowercase.\n\nThe third Java program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces commas with spaces, then outputs it.\n\nSo the sequence is: input N \u2192 first program outputs a number \u2192 that number is the input to the second program? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is a number, but the second program expects a word. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the first program's output is a number (like a long), the second expects a word (a string). That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code again:\n\nFirst program's main reads an integer N from stdin, then outputs the result of calc(), which is a long. So the first program's output is a number, like \"12345\".\n\nSecond program's main reads a word from stdin. So the input to the second program must be a single word. But the first program's output is a number, so that's okay. For example, if the first outputs \"12345\", the second would process \"12345\" as the word, count uppercase vs lowercase (but all digits, so lowercase count is 5, uppercase 0, so output lowercase, which is same as input. So the second program would output \"12345\".\n\nThird program takes that output (the string \"12345\") and replaces commas with spaces. But there are no commas, so it outputs the same string. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is a number, but when printed, it's a string. So the sequence is:\n\nInput to first program is N (integer). Output is a number (string). Second program takes that number as a word, processes it (since it's all lowercase digits, it outputs the same). Third program takes that string, replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, outputs the same. So the final output is the same as the first program's output.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a number, but the second program expects a word. So the first program's output is a string (like \"12345\"), which is the input to the second program. The second program processes it (since all lowercase, outputs same). Third program then takes that string and replaces commas with spaces. So if the first program's output has no commas, the third program's output is the same as the second's, which is same as first's. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But that would mean the second and third steps do nothing. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, but the second program's input is a word. So the first program's output is a number, which is a string, so the second program takes that as the word. For example, if the first outputs \"123\", then the second program would process \"123\" (all lowercase, so output same). Then the third program takes that \"123\" and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are none, outputs same. So the final output is the same as first's output. But that would mean the second and third steps are redundant. That can't be the case. Maybe the actual input to the first program is a string that can be processed through all three steps?\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final Fortran program must read the initial input (to the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result (third program's output).\n\nSo the first Java program's input is N (integer), output is a number (string). The second program takes that number as its input (as a word), processes it (convert to uppercase or lowercase), then the third program takes that result (the modified word) and replaces commas with spaces.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a single word. So if the first program outputs \"12345\", then the second program's input is \"12345\", which is all lowercase letters (digits are lowercase?), so it outputs the same. Then the third program takes that and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is same as input. So the final output is the same as first's output. But that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that contains letters, so the second program can process it.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, but when printed, it's a string. So the second program's input is that string. For example, if the first program outputs \"AGC123\", then the second program would process that. But the first program's output is a number, so that's not possible. Wait, the first program's output is a long, so it's printed as a decimal number. So the first program's output is a numeric string. So the second program's input is that numeric string, which is all lowercase (digits are lowercase?), so the second program outputs the same. Then the third program replaces commas with spaces. So if the first program's output has no commas, the third program's output is same as second's. So the final output is the same as first's output. But that would mean the second and third steps do nothing. That's possible, but maybe the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a string with letters, but that's not possible because the first program's output is a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that includes letters. Wait, no, the first program's output is the result of ins.calc(), which is a long, so it's printed as a number. So the first program's output is a numeric string. So the second program's input is that numeric string, which is all lowercase (digits are lowercase?), so the second program outputs the same. The third program then takes that numeric string and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is same as input. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. So the entire sequence is equivalent to just running the first program and outputting its result. But that can't be right. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three Java programs are not in the order given. Wait, the user provided three Java files, and the sequence is first, then second, then third. So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So the first program's output must be a string that the second can process, and the second's output must be a string that the third can process.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (like \"12345\"), which is a string. The second program takes that as a word. Since all characters are digits (which are lowercase?), the second program would output the same. The third program takes that string and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is same. So the final output is the same as the first's output. So the entire sequence is equivalent to just the first program. But that's possible. Maybe the user intended that, but perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string with letters, but that's not possible because it's a number. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string that includes letters. Wait, no, the first program's output is a long, so it's printed as a number. So the first program's output is a numeric string. So the second program's input is that numeric string, which is all lowercase (digits are lowercase?), so the second program outputs the same. The third program then takes that and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is same. So the final output is the same as the first's output. So the entire sequence is equivalent to just the first program. But that's possible. Maybe the user intended that, but perhaps the actual problem requires that the three programs are connected in a way that their outputs are passed correctly. So the Fortran program must read the input (the N for the first program), compute the first's result, then process that result through the second and third steps, and output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N from input (the first program's input).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number).\n\n3. Take that number as a string, process it through the second program's logic (convert to uppercase or lowercase based on counts).\n\n4. Take the result from step 3, process through the third program's logic (replace commas with spaces).\n\n5. Output the final string.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the first program's output (the number as a string).\n\n- Apply the second program's processing to that string.\n\n- Apply the third program's processing to the result.\n\n- Output the final string.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read N from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (the number modulo 1e9+7).\n\n- Convert that number to a string (like \"12345\").\n\n- Process that string through the second program's logic (count uppercase vs lowercase letters in the string, then decide to uppercase or lowercase the entire string).\n\nWait, but the string from the first program is all digits, which are considered lowercase? Or uppercase? In Java, digits are neither uppercase nor lowercase, but in the second program's code, it counts uppercase letters and lowercase letters. For a digit, it would be counted as lowercase? Because Character.isUpperCase returns false for digits, so they are added to lowercase count. So the second program would process the numeric string as all lowercase, so output the same string in lowercase (which is same as input).\n\nThen, the third program takes that string and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is same as input. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. So the entire sequence is equivalent to just the first program. But that's possible. So the Fortran program can just compute the first program's result and output it. But that's only if the second and third steps do nothing. But maybe the user intended that the three programs are connected in a way that their outputs are passed correctly, even if the steps don't change the data. So the Fortran program must still perform all steps.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number as a string).\n\n3. Process that string through the second program's logic (convert to uppercase or lowercase).\n\n4. Process the result through the third program's logic (replace commas with spaces).\n\n5. Output the final string.\n\nSo even if steps 2-4 don't change the data, the Fortran program must do all steps.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate each Java program into Fortran functions, ensuring that the data flows correctly between them without I/O except first and last.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first Java program (atcoder_ABC122_D). It's a dynamic programming problem with memoization. The problem is to count the number of valid strings of length N, where the string doesn't contain \"AGC\" in any form, even after swapping adjacent characters. The constraints are that the last four characters (when adding a new character) must not form \"AGC\" in any way.\n\nThe first program uses a recursive DFS with memoization. The memo is an array of maps, where each map is for a current length and the last three characters. The key is the last three characters, and the value is the count.\n\nIn Fortran, handling memoization with strings as keys is tricky. Since Fortran doesn't have hash maps, we need to find a way to represent the memoization table. The possible last three characters are combinations of \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\". There are 4^3 = 64 possible combinations. So for each position (current length from 0 to N), and each of the 64 possible last three characters, we can store the count.\n\nSo the memo can be represented as a 2D array: memo(current, last3_code) where last3_code is an integer from 0 to 63 (each representing a 3-character string). The first step is to map each 3-character string to an integer.\n\nLet's see: the characters are A, C, G, T. Let's assign each a number: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3. Then, for a 3-character string, the code would be (first_char)*16 + (second_char)*4 + third_char. So each of the three characters contributes to the code. So for \"AAA\", it's 0*16 +0*4 +0 =0. For \"AGC\", it's 0*16 +2*4 +1 = 9 (since G is 2, C is 1? Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the characters are A, C, G, T. So the order is A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3. So \"AGC\" would be A (0), G (2), C (1). So the code would be 0*16 + 2*4 +1 = 0 +8 +1=9. So each 3-character string can be mapped to a unique integer between 0 and 63.\n\nTherefore, the memo can be a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64. Each entry memo[i][code] holds the number of valid strings of length i ending with the 3-character string represented by code.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"). The code for \"TTT\" is T (3) for each character: 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 =63. So the initial code is 63.\n\nThe function dfs(current, last3) is equivalent to a recursive function that builds up the count. To avoid recursion (since Fortran doesn't handle recursion well for large N?), perhaps we can implement it iteratively with memoization using the array.\n\nWait, but the original Java code uses memoization with a recursive approach. To translate this into Fortran, we can precompute the memo array using dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize the memo array. For current =0, the initial state is last3 = \"TTT\" (code 63). So memo[0][63] =1 (since starting with 0 length, the count is 1 for that state).\n\nThen, for each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   For each possible last3 code (0 to 63):\n\n      If memo[current][code] is 0, skip (since it's not reachable).\n\n      For each possible next character (A, C, G, T):\n\n          new_char = the character (0-3)\n\n          new_last3 = the last three characters after adding new_char.\n\n          The new_last3 is formed by taking the last two characters of the previous last3 plus the new_char.\n\n          So, for example, if previous last3 was \"XYZ\", adding 'A' gives \"YZA\".\n\n          So the new_last3's code is (Y's value)*16 + (Z's value)*4 + new_char.\n\n          Then, we need to check if the new_last3 plus the new_char (wait, no, the check is on the last four characters. Wait, the isOK function checks the last four characters (the previous last3 plus the new character). Wait, the isOK function in Java takes last4, which is last3 + c. So the new four characters are the previous last3 (3 chars) plus the new character, making four characters. The function checks if any permutation of swapping adjacent characters in those four would form \"AGC\".\n\n          So in the Fortran code, for each possible new character, we need to check if the new four-character string (previous_last3 + new_char) is valid.\n\n          To compute this, we can generate the four-character string, then check the conditions.\n\n          So for each possible new_char (0-3):\n\n              construct the four-character string: prev_last3 (3 chars) + new_char's character.\n\n              check if this four-character string contains \"AGC\" as a substring, or any of its adjacent swaps would form \"AGC\".\n\n              If it's valid, then we can proceed.\n\n          If valid, then the new_last3 is the last three characters of the four (i.e., the last three characters after adding the new_char).\n\n          So the new_last3 is the substring of the four-character string from position 2 to 4 (assuming 1-based?), but in code terms, the new code is computed as (second_char)*16 + (third_char)*4 + new_char.\n\n          So for each valid new_char, we can add the current count to the next state's count.\n\n          The memoization is done by updating memo[current+1][new_code] += memo[current][current_code], modulo MOD.\n\nSo the approach is to precompute the memo array using dynamic programming, iterating over current from 0 to N, and for each possible code, and each possible next character, check validity, then update the next code's count.\n\nThis way, we can avoid recursion and use loops.\n\nNow, the first step is to implement this dynamic programming approach in Fortran.\n\nNext, the second program (codeforces_59_A) takes a word and converts it to uppercase or lowercase based on the counts. The Fortran code can read the string (from the first program's output), count uppercase and lowercase letters, then decide which case to use.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC051_A) replaces commas with spaces. So in Fortran, we can process the string by replacing each comma with a space.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number as a string).\n\n3. Process that string through the second program's logic (convert to uppercase or lowercase).\n\n4. Process the result through the third program's logic (replace commas with spaces).\n\n5. Output the final string.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the first part (the dynamic programming):\n\nWe need to compute the count for N, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe steps for the first part:\n\nInitialize memo array. Since N can be up to, say, 1e5? Wait, looking at the original problem (ABC122 D), the constraints for N are probably up to 800 or so (since the problem is from AtCoder, which often has constraints like N up to 800 for DP with O(N*4^3) time). Let's assume N is manageable.\n\nThe memo array can be a 2D array of integers (or 64-bit integers, since the count can be up to 1e9+7^something). In Fortran, we can use an array of size (N+1) x 64, with modulo operations.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read N from input.\n\nThen, initialize the memo array. The initial state is memo(0, 63) = 1 (since \"TTT\" is code 63).\n\nThen, for each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   For each code in 0 to 63:\n\n      if memo(current, code) is zero, skip.\n\n      get the previous last3 string (to form the four-character string when adding a new character).\n\n      To get the previous last3 string, we can decode the code into three characters.\n\n      For each possible next_char (0 to 3):\n\n          new_char = next_char (0=A, 1=C, 2=G, 3=T)\n\n          construct the four-character string: prev_last3 (3 chars) + new_char's character.\n\n          check if this four-character string is valid (isOK).\n\n          if valid:\n\n              compute the new_last3 code: the last three characters of the four (i.e., the second, third, and new_char).\n\n              new_code = (second_char)*16 + (third_char)*4 + new_char.\n\n              memo(current+1, new_code) = (memo(current+1, new_code) + memo(current, code)) mod MOD\n\nWait, but to compute the four-character string, we need to know the previous last3's characters. So for each code, we can precompute the three characters.\n\nAlternatively, for each code, we can split it into its components:\n\ncode = a*16 + b*4 + c, where a, b, c are 0-3.\n\nSo the previous last3 is (a, b, c). So the four-character string is a, b, c, new_char.\n\nWait, the four-character string is the previous last3 (a, b, c) plus the new_char (d), so the four is a,b,c,d.\n\nThen, the isOK function checks:\n\n1. Does the four-character string contain \"AGC\" as a substring?\n\n2. For each of the first three positions (i from 0 to 2), swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the original Java code's isOK function:\n\nThe four-character string is last4 (the previous last3 plus the new character). The function first checks if it contains \"AGC\". If yes, return false.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2 (since the four characters are 0-based?), it swaps the i and i+1 characters, then checks if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n\n    vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n\n    String s = new String(vals);\n\n    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n\n        return false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe loop is for i from 0 to 2 (since the four characters are 0-based, indices 0,1,2,3). For each i, swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters. Then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, but the code in Java does:\n\nvals[i] = last4.charAt(i+1);\n\nvals[i+1] = last4.charAt(i);\n\nWait, that's not a swap. Because first, vals[i] is set to the next character, then vals[i+1] is set to the previous. So the result is that the two characters are swapped. For example, if the original was \"abcd\", then for i=0, after swapping, it becomes \"bacd\".\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nvals[i] = vals[i+1], then vals[i+1] = vals[i]. Wait no, the code is:\n\nvals[i] = last4's (i+1)th character.\n\nvals[i+1] = last4's ith character.\n\nSo the two characters are swapped. So the code is correct.\n\nSo for each possible swap of adjacent characters in the four-character string, check if any of those swapped strings contain \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of those is true, then the four-character string is invalid.\n\nSo the four-character string must not contain \"AGC\" in any of its original form or any of the three possible single adjacent swaps.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, for each four-character string (a,b,c,d), we need to check:\n\n1. Does the original string contain \"AGC\"?\n\n2. For each possible swap of adjacent characters (swap positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3):\n\n   create the swapped string and check if it contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, but the loop in Java is for i from 0 to 2 (since there are three possible adjacent pairs in four characters: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3). So for each of those three pairs, swap them and check.\n\nWait, the loop is for i from 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2). The swap is between i and i+1. So for i=0, swap 0 and 1; i=1, swap 1 and 2; i=2, swap 2 and 3. So all three possible adjacent pairs.\n\nSo for each of those three swaps, create the new string and check for \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of the original or any of the swapped strings contain \"AGC\", then the four-character string is invalid.\n\nSo in code, for a given four-character string (a,b,c,d), we need to check:\n\noriginal: contains \"AGC\"?\n\nif yes, invalid.\n\nelse, check each of the three swaps:\n\nswap 0 and 1: new string is (b,a,c,d). Check if this contains \"AGC\".\n\nswap 1 and 2: (a,c,b,d). Check.\n\nswap 2 and 3: (a,b,d,c). Check.\n\nIf any of those contain \"AGC\", then invalid.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each four-character string (represented as four characters a, b, c, d), we can check all these conditions.\n\nTo do this, perhaps we can represent the four characters as a string, then check for the presence of \"AGC\".\n\nAlternatively, since the characters are from A, C, G, T, we can check all possible substrings of length 3 in the four-character string and its swapped versions.\n\nAlternatively, for the original four-character string, check if any of the three possible 3-letter substrings (positions 0-2, 1-3) contain \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the original four-character string can have \"AGC\" in positions 0-2, 1-3, or overlapping?\n\nWait, \"AGC\" is three characters. So in a four-character string, the possible starting positions are 0 and 1. So the substrings are 0-2 (first three) and 1-3 (last three). So the original four-character string has \"AGC\" if either of those substrings is \"AGC\".\n\nSimilarly, after swapping, the new string may have \"AGC\" in any of its three-character substrings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to generate the four-character string as a string, then check for \"AGC\" in the original and in each of the three swapped versions.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each four-character string (a, b, c, d):\n\noriginal_str = [a][b][c][d]\n\nif original_str contains \"AGC\", then invalid.\n\nElse, check each swap:\n\nswap01: [b][a][c][d]\n\nswap12: [a][c][b][d]\n\nswap23: [a][b][d][c]\n\nCheck each of these three strings for \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of them contains \"AGC\", then the four-character string is invalid.\n\nSo in code, for each four-character string, we can perform these checks.\n\nNow, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, for a given code (previous last3's code) and new_char (0-3), we can get the four characters as follows:\n\nThe previous last3's code is code = a*16 + b*4 + c.\n\nSo a = (code / 16) mod 4\n\nb = (code /4) mod4\n\nc = code mod4\n\nThe new_char is d (0-3).\n\nSo the four characters are a, b, c, d.\n\nThen, construct the original string as a string of length 4 (each character is 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their numbers).\n\nThen check if \"AGC\" is present in the original string.\n\nIf not, then check each of the three swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can do this without constructing the string, by checking the characters directly.\n\nFor example, the original string has \"AGC\" if any of the following:\n\npositions 0-2: a, b, c \u2192 check if a=0 (A), b=2 (G), c=1 (C).\n\npositions 1-3: b, c, d \u2192 check if b=0, c=2, d=1.\n\nSo for the original string, check if (a==0 and b==2 and c==1) or (b==0 and c==2 and d==1).\n\nSimilarly, for the swapped strings:\n\nswap01: the first two characters are swapped. So the first three characters are b, a, c. Check if b=0, a=2, c=1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\nOr the last three (a, c, d) \u2192 a, c, d.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to represent the four characters as an array and check for the presence of \"AGC\" in the original and swapped versions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the four characters as an array of four elements (a, b, c, d).\n\nOriginal check:\n\nCheck if any of the following is true:\n\n(a == 'A' and b == 'G' and c == 'C') \u2192 but in our numbering, A=0, G=2, C=1 \u2192 so a=0, b=2, c=1.\n\nOR (b == 'A' and c == 'G' and d == 'C') \u2192 b=0, c=2, d=1.\n\nSo for the original four characters, if either of those is true, then invalid.\n\nThen, for each swap:\n\nSwap01: swap a and b \u2192 new first three are b, a, c. Check if b=0, a=2, c=1 \u2192 (b==0, a==2, c==1).\n\nAlso check the last three (a, c, d) \u2192 a (now the second character?), no, the four characters after swap01 are (b, a, c, d). So the first three are b, a, c \u2192 check for \"AGC\".\n\nAlso, the last three (a, c, d) \u2192 but the third and fourth are c and d. So the last three are a, c, d \u2192 but the third character is c, fourth is d. Wait, the last three would be a, c, d? No, the four characters are b, a, c, d \u2192 the last three are a, c, d. So check if a=0, c=2, d=1 \u2192 (a==0, c==2, d==1).\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Maybe it's better to code the checks as follows:\n\nFor the original four characters (a, b, c, d):\n\nCheck if any of the following is true:\n\n- (a ==0 and b ==2 and c ==1) \u2192 \"AGC\" in first three.\n\n- (b ==0 and c ==2 and d ==1) \u2192 \"AGC\" in last three.\n\nIf either is true, then invalid.\n\nThen, for each swap:\n\nSwap01: new characters are (b, a, c, d).\n\nCheck if any of the first three (b, a, c) \u2192 (b==0, a==2, c==1) \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\nOr the last three (a, c, d) \u2192 (a==0, c==2, d==1).\n\nSwap12: new characters are (a, c, b, d).\n\nCheck first three (a, c, b) \u2192 (a==0, c==2, b==1) \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\nOr last three (c, b, d) \u2192 (c==0, b==2, d==1).\n\nSwap23: new characters are (a, b, d, c).\n\nCheck first three (a, b, d) \u2192 (a==0, b==2, d==1).\n\nOr last three (b, d, c) \u2192 (b==0, d==2, c==1).\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to code the checks for each swap's four characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to represent the four characters as a string and check for \"AGC\" in each of the four-character strings (original and swapped versions).\n\nIn Fortran, we can create a character array of length 4, then check for the substring.\n\nSo for the original four characters (a, b, c, d):\n\nConstruct the string s = char(a) // char(b) // char(c) // char(d), where each char is 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their numbers (0-3).\n\nThen check if s contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf yes, invalid.\n\nElse, check each of the three swaps:\n\nFor swap01:\n\nnew_s = char(b) // char(a) // char(c) // char(d)\n\nCheck if new_s contains \"AGC\".\n\nSimilarly for swap12 and swap23.\n\nIf any of these new_s contains \"AGC\", then invalid.\n\nSo in code, for each four-character combination, we can do this.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the characters can be mapped as follows:\n\ninteger :: char_map(0:3) = [ ichar('A'), ichar('C'), ichar('G'), ichar('T') ]\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are stored as their ASCII codes. So for a given number (0-3), we can get the corresponding character.\n\nAlternatively, we can have a character array:\n\ncharacter(1) :: chars(0:3) = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\nThen, for a number x (0-3), chars(x) gives the character.\n\nSo for a given a, b, c, d (each 0-3), the original string is:\n\noriginal = chars(a) // chars(b) // chars(c) // chars(d)\n\nThen check if \"AGC\" is a substring.\n\nTo check if a string contains \"AGC\", we can loop through the possible starting positions.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use the index function:\n\nif (index(original, 'AGC') /= 0) then \u2192 invalid.\n\nSimilarly for the swapped strings.\n\nSo putting this together, the validity check for a four-character string (a,b,c,d) is:\n\nvalid = .true.\n\noriginal = chars(a)//chars(b)//chars(c)//chars(d)\n\nif (index(original, 'AGC') /= 0) then\n\n   valid = .false.\n\nelse\n\n   ! check swaps\n\n   ! swap01: swap first two\n\n   s0 = chars(b)//chars(a)//chars(c)//chars(d)\n\n   if (index(s0, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\n   ! swap12: swap second and third\n\n   s1 = chars(a)//chars(c)//chars(b)//chars(d)\n\n   if (index(s1, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\n   ! swap23: swap third and fourth\n\n   s2 = chars(a)//chars(b)//chars(d)//chars(c)\n\n   if (index(s2, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\nendif\n\nif (valid) then \u2192 proceed.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the dynamic programming steps:\n\nInitialize the memo array as a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64, initialized to 0.\n\nmemo(0, 63) = 1 (since the initial last3 is \"TTT\", which is code 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63).\n\nThen, for each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n   do code = 0, 63\n\n      if (memo(current, code) ==0) cycle\n\n      a = (code /16) mod4\n\n      b = (code /4) mod4\n\n      c = code mod4\n\n      do d =0,3 ! next character (0-3)\n\n          ! construct the four characters a,b,c,d\n\n          ! check validity\n\n          valid = .true.\n\n          original = chars(a)//chars(b)//chars(c)//chars(d)\n\n          if (index(original, 'AGC') /=0) then\n\n              valid = .false.\n\n          else\n\n              s0 = chars(b)//chars(a)//chars(c)//chars(d)\n\n              if (index(s0, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\n              s1 = chars(a)//chars(c)//chars(b)//chars(d)\n\n              if (index(s1, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\n              s2 = chars(a)//chars(b)//chars(d)//chars(c)\n\n              if (index(s2, 'AGC') /=0) valid = .false.\n\n          end if\n\n          if (.not. valid) cycle\n\n          ! compute new_code: the last three characters are b,c,d \u2192 no, wait:\n\n          ! the new last three is the last three of the four characters (b,c,d? No, the four are a,b,c,d \u2192 the new last three is b,c,d?\n\n          Wait, the new last three is the last three characters of the four, which are b, c, d? No, the four characters are a, b, c, d \u2192 the last three are b, c, d? No, the last three are the last three of the four, which are b, c, d? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the previous last three were a, b, c. Adding d makes the new last three as b, c, d.\n\nYes. So the new last three is (b, c, d).\n\nSo the new_code is (b)*16 + (c)*4 + d.\n\n          new_code = b*16 + c*4 + d\n\n          memo(current+1, new_code) = modulo(memo(current+1, new_code) + memo(current, code), MOD)\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code above, the a, b, c are the previous last three (from the code). So the four characters are a, b, c, d. The new last three is b, c, d \u2192 so the new code is (b)*16 + (c)*4 + d.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this loop should correctly compute the memo array.\n\nOnce the memo array is filled up to N, the result is the sum of all memo[N][code] for all codes, modulo MOD.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem requires that the entire string of length N has no forbidden patterns. The final count is the sum of all possible last three codes' counts at current=N.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, the base case is when current == N, return 1. So the memo[N][code] is the number of ways to reach that state with length N. So the total is the sum over all codes of memo[N][code].\n\nWait, in the Java code's dfs function, when current == N, it returns 1. So each path that reaches current=N contributes 1 to the total. So the total is the sum of all memo[N][code] values.\n\nTherefore, the final result is sum_{code=0 to 63} memo(N, code).\n\nSo after filling the memo array, we compute the total as the sum of all entries in memo(N, :).\n\nNow, the first part is done.\n\nNext, the second program's processing: take the number as a string, count uppercase and lowercase letters, then convert to uppercase or lowercase.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number, so when converted to a string, it's a sequence of digits. Digits are considered lowercase in the second program's code?\n\nIn Java, Character.isUpperCase returns false for digits, so they are counted in lowercase. So the second program will count all digits as lowercase, so the lowercase count is the length of the string, uppercase is 0. So the output is the lowercase version of the string, which is the same as the input.\n\nSo the second program's processing does nothing here. But in code, we have to implement it.\n\nThe second step in Fortran:\n\nTake the string (the first program's output as a string), count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nThen decide to convert to lowercase or uppercase.\n\nIn Fortran, we can process each character:\n\ninteger :: uppercase =0, lowercase =0\n\ncharacter(len=*) :: s = first_result\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   s = uppercase(s)\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   s = lowercase(s)\n\nelse\n\n   s = lowercase(s)\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, converting to uppercase or lowercase can be done with intrinsic functions. For example, using the 'achar' and 'ichar' functions, or using the 'adjustl' and 'adjustr' (but those are for trimming). Alternatively, we can loop through each character and change case.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'uppercase' and 'lowercase' functions if available. In Fortran 2003, there are functions like 'adjustr' but not case conversion. So perhaps we need to implement it manually.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'achar' and 'ichar' functions:\n\nfunction to_upper(c) result(res)\n\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n\n   character :: res\n\n   integer :: ic = ichar(c)\n\n   if (ic >= ichar('a') .and. ic <= ichar('z')) then\n\n      res = achar(ic - 32)\n\n   else\n\n      res = c\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nSimilarly for to_lower.\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's easier to process each character.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s = first_result_str\n\ninteger :: uppercase =0, lowercase =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   else\n\n      ! digits or other characters, count as lowercase?\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = s(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n         s(i:i) = achar(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = s(i:i)\n\n      if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n         s(i:i) = achar(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the case of equality, we choose lowercase, so we convert to lowercase.\n\nSo the code above would handle that.\n\nThird program's processing: replace commas with spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop through each character and replace ',' with ' '.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s = second_result\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      s(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program steps:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number as a string).\n\n3. Process through second program's logic (convert case).\n\n4. Process through third program's logic (replace commas).\n\n5. Output the final string.\n\nNow, the first step is to compute the first program's result.\n\nImplementing the dynamic programming in Fortran:\n\nWe need to define the MOD as 1000000007.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n   integer :: N\n\n   character(1), dimension(0:3) :: chars = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']\n\n   integer :: memo(0:800, 0:63) = 0 ! assuming N up to 800\n\n   integer :: result\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   !

Output s3\n\n   print *, trim(s3)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, the memo array's size is declared as (0:800, 0:63). But what if N is larger than 800? The original problem's constraints for ABC122 D probably have N up to 800. Let me check.\n\nLooking up the problem ABC122 D: the constraints are N \u2264 800. So this is okay.\n\nNow, some possible issues:\n\n- The memo array is initialized to 0, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0 by default if not set. So the code initializes memo(0,63)=1, and others are 0.\n\n- The loops for current from 0 to N-1.\n\n- The code for checking the validity of the four-character string.\n\n- The final result is the sum of memo(N, code).\n\n- The string conversion: using write(s, '(I0)') result to get the string.\n\n- The second program's processing: the code for uppercase and lowercase.\n\n- The third program's processing: replacing commas with spaces.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: N=3.\n\nThe first program's output should be the number of valid strings of length 3.\n\nWait, but the initial last3 is \"TTT\", so adding characters to reach length 3.\n\nWait, the first program's code starts with dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which builds up to N.\n\nWait, for N=3, the total length is 3, so the initial \"TTT\" is the first three characters, and adding one more character to reach length 3? No, the initial current is 0, and the last3 is \"TTT\", which is the first three characters. So when current reaches 3, the total length is 3.\n\nWait, the code's base case is when current == N, return 1. So for N=3, the valid strings are those of length 3, with the last three characters being whatever, but the four-character check must be valid.\n\nBut perhaps the actual count for N=3 is small and can be tested.\n\nBut in any case, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother test case: N=0? Probably not, since the problem likely requires N \u22651.\n\nNow, the final output is the string after processing through all three steps. Since the first program's output is a number (digits), the second program leaves it as lowercase (digits are lowercase), and the third program does nothing (no commas), so the final output is the same as the first program's output.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The memo array's indices: in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless declared with 0:.\n\nIn the code above, the memo is declared as (0:800, 0:63), so it's okay.\n\n- The loops for current from 0 to N-1: correct.\n\n- The calculation of new_code: correct.\n\n- The validity checks using the index function: in Fortran, the index function returns the first occurrence. So if the substring \"AGC\" is present anywhere in the string, it will be found.\n\n- The replacement of commas with spaces: correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
