So the new mod is (pre + next * 10^i) mod13. But the code uses (base * next + pre) mod13, which is the same as (next * base + pre) mod13. So that's correct. The initial condition is that for i=0 (the first step, processing the last character), when i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the condition (i>0 ? ... : (pre==0 ?1 :0)). So for the first step (i=0), the previous is the initial state (pre must be 0 to have 1 way). So the DP is built correctly.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC139_B) reads two integers A and B from input. It calculates a result based on some formula. The formula is (B-1)/(A-1), then checks if there's a remainder. If so, adds 1. The output is this result.\n\nThe second program (codeforces_622_A) takes a long integer position. It uses a loop to find the nearest sequence start index, then calculates the position's rank in that sequence. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index*(index-1)/2). The output here is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) processes a string of characters, which can include '?'. It uses dynamic programming to compute a count modulo 1e9+7, specifically looking for numbers where the mod 13 is 5 after considering all possible replacements of '?' with digits. The final output is the count for mod 5.\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain these three programs into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But in Fortran, we can't have intermediate I/O between them. So all processing must be done in memory.\n\nWait, but the user says: Only the first block should read input, the last produce output. Intermediate steps process without I/O. So the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program where the first part reads the initial input, then passes data through variables to the next steps, and finally the last part outputs the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read A and B from input (first Java program's input).\n2. Compute the first result (result1) using the first program's logic.\n3. Use result1 as the input for the second program, which computes result2.\n4. Use result2 as the input for the third program, which computes the final output.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a long (position). So the first program's output (result1) is an integer, which is then used as the position in the second program. Then the second program's output (result2) is an integer, which is the input for the third program?\n\nWait, looking at the third Java program's input: it reads a string (cs = sc.next().toCharArray();). Wait, no, the third program's input is a string, not a number. Wait, that's a problem. Because the second program's output is an integer (the result from codeforces_622_A), which would be passed to the third program as input. But the third program expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the third program expects a string input. So the second program's output must be a string? Let me check the second Java program's output.\n\nLooking at codeforces_622_A's output: it prints (position - startIndex) +1, which is an integer. So the second program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. That's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the third Java program's code:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC135_D {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new atcoder_ABC135_D().run();\n    }\n\n    void run() {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        char[] cs = sc.next().toCharArray();\n        ... \n    }\n\nSo the third program reads a string (the next token from input, which is a string). So the input to the third program is a string. But the second program's output is an integer. So how does that fit?\n\nAh, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Wait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is an integer (result1), which is the input to the second program. The second program's input is a long (position), so that's okay. The second program's output is an integer (result2), which is the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. That's a problem. Unless the third program's input is actually the result2 as a string? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the third program's input is not the output of the second, but the user's original setup must have the outputs connected as input. So maybe the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is an integer, but the third program expects a string. That would be a problem. Unless the third program's input is a string that is the output of the second program. For example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program reads that as a string. But in the original Java setup, the second program's output is an integer printed as a line, so the third program would read that line as a string. Wait, but in Java, the third program would read the next token from System.in, which would be the output of the second program. So if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program's input is \"5\", which is a string. So the third program would process that as a string of digits. So that's okay. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second program's output. So the third program's input is a string, which is the output of the second program (an integer printed as a line). So in the Fortran program, the second's result (integer) must be converted to a string and passed to the third's processing.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read A and B from input (first program's input).\n2. Compute result1 (integer) using first program's logic.\n3. Use result1 as the input to the second program, which computes result2 (integer).\n4. Convert result2 to a string, then pass it to the third program's processing (which expects a string input).\n5. The third program's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, all these steps must be done in memory. The first part reads A and B, computes result1. Then uses that to compute result2. Then converts result2 to a string, and processes it through the third program's logic, then outputs the final result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read A and B from input (first part).\n- Compute result1 as per first Java program.\n- Compute result2 using result1 as the input to the second program's logic.\n- Convert result2 to a string (since third program expects a string input).\n- Process this string through the third program's logic.\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (Java's first program):\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nresult = (B - 1) / (A - 1)\namari = (B - 1) % (A - 1)\nif (amari !=0) result +=1\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero. However, in Java, (B-1)/(A-1) would be integer division, which for positive numbers is the same as floor division. Since A and B are inputs, but in the problem's context, perhaps A and B are positive integers. So the formula should be okay.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nresult1 = (B-1) / (A-1)\namari = mod(B-1, A-1)\nif (amari /=0) then\n   result1 = result1 +1\nend if\n\nSecond part (Java's second program):\n\nThe second program takes a long (position) as input. The code is a bit more complex. Let's see:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\nsolve() function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx =1;\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position) {\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *=2;\n}\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\nlong startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\nout.println( (position - startIndex) +1 );\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is:\n\nlong getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n    return 1 + (index-1)*index/2;\n}\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nWe need to find the largest index such that the value at that index is <= position, but the next index's value is > position. Wait, let me think:\n\nThe first loop finds the starting point by doubling until the value is too big. Then the second loop steps forward until the next value exceeds the position.\n\nThe goal is to find the starting index of the block where the position is located. The final result is the position's offset within that block plus 1.\n\nIn Fortran, variables can be integers or integers of larger size. Since Java uses long, which is 64 bits, in Fortran we can use integer(8) (assuming 64-bit integers).\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the second part would be:\n\nposition = result1  ! since the first program's output is the input here.\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\nresult2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nwhere getValueAtIndex is a function:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for integers, it truncates. Since in Java, (index-1)*index/2 is integer division. So in Fortran, same.\n\nThird part (Java's third program):\n\nThe third program takes a string (the input from the second program's output, which is the integer result2 converted to a string). The third program processes this string using dynamic programming to compute a count modulo 1e9+7, specifically for mod 5.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe input is a string (cs) which is read as sc.next().toCharArray(). The code uses dynamic programming with a 2D array dp of size [cs.length][13], tracking the number of ways to form numbers mod 13 up to each position.\n\nThe algorithm:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] =1 (since for the first character, if it's a 0, then mod 0, but the code uses base=1 initially. Wait, let me look at the code again.\n\nWait, in the third Java program's code:\n\nThe run() function:\n\nchar[] cs = sc.next().toCharArray();\nlong[][] dp = new long[cs.length][13];\nint base =1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n    if (cs[cs.length-1 -i] == '?') { ... }\n    else { ... }\n    base = base *10 %13;\n}\n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to cs.length-1. The index into the char array is cs.length-1 -i. So the processing is done from the end of the string towards the start. Because for i=0, it's the last character, then i=1 is the second last, etc. So the processing is in reverse order of the string.\n\nWait, the code is processing the characters in reverse order. The base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 13. The base represents 10^i mod 13, where i is the number of digits processed so far (but in reverse order?).\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think:\n\nThe DP is tracking the current mod 13 value. For each character (processed in reverse), we consider possible digits (0-9 if it's a '?', or fixed if it's a digit). The base is 10^i mod 13, where i is the number of digits processed so far (since we're going backwards, each step adds a digit to the left, so the exponent increases).\n\nWait, the base starts at 1 (for the first character, which is the last digit of the number). Then, for each next character (moving left), the base is multiplied by 10 mod 13. So the base represents 10^k mod 13, where k is the number of digits processed so far (starting from 0). \n\nThe DP[i][pre] represents the number of ways to form numbers up to the i-th step (from the end) such that the mod 13 is pre. \n\nThe transitions are:\n\nFor each position i (from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the string), and for each possible previous mod value (pre), and for each possible next digit (0-9 or the fixed digit if not '?'), the new mod is (base * next_digit + pre) mod 13. The DP[i][new_mod] += DP[i-1][pre], etc.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the loop over i (from 0 to cs.length-1):\n\nThe current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (the least significant digit). \n\nThe base starts at 1. For each step, after processing the current character, the base is multiplied by 10 mod 13. \n\nSo for the first character (i=0), the digit is multiplied by 1 (base) to contribute to the mod. The next step (i=1) would have base 10 mod13, so the next digit (to the left) is multiplied by 10, etc. \n\nThe DP array is of size [cs.length][13]. For each i, the current step is processing the (n-1 -i)th character. \n\nThe code for the '?' case:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n        dp[i][(base*next + pre) %13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n        mod MOD\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the next digit is next, and the contribution is next * base (since base is 10^i mod13?), so the term is (next * base + pre) mod13? Wait, the formula is (base * next + pre) mod13. Wait, perhaps the order is different. Let me think:\n\nThe current digit is next. Since we are processing from the end, the digit's contribution is next * 10^i mod13. The previous mod is pre. So the new mod is (pre + next * 10^i) mod13. Wait, but the code uses (base * next + pre) mod13. Since base is 10^i mod13, then base * next is next *10^i mod13. Adding pre (the previous mod) gives (next *10^i + pre) mod13. Wait, but that would be the same as (pre + next *10^i) mod13. So the order is correct.\n\nWait, the previous mod is pre, and the new digit contributes next * 10^i. So the new mod is (pre + next * 10^i) mod13. But the code uses (base * next + pre) mod13, which is the same as (next * base + pre) mod13. So that's correct.\n\nThe initial condition is that for i=0 (the first step, processing the last character), when i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the condition (i>0 ? ... : (pre==0 ?1 :0)). So for the first step (i=0), the previous is the initial state (pre must be 0 to have 1 way). \n\nSo the DP is built correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to replicate this. The input to the third part is the string representation of result2. So first, we need to convert result2 to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a character variable.\n\nSo steps for the third part:\n\n1. Convert result2 to a string (since the third program expects a string input). Let's say the string is s.\n\n2. Process s through the DP algorithm.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be a 2D array of integers (or integers with modulo 1e9+7). Since the MOD is 1e9+7, which is a large number, we need to use 64-bit integers. In Fortran, integers can be selected with kind parameters. Let's use integer(8) for all variables involved in the DP.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\n- Convert result2 to a string s.\n\n- Get the length of s (n = len_trim(s)).\n\n- Initialize a 2D array dp(n, 13) of integer(8).\n\n- Initialize base =1.\n\n- Loop over i from 1 to n (since in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default, but maybe better to use 0-based? Or adjust indices accordingly. Let me think.)\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < cs.length; ++i). So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 0-based indices, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps better to adjust variables to 1-based.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based by setting the array to start at 0. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, to have a 0-based array, we can declare:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:n-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nBut first, the string length is n = len_trim(s). So:\n\ncharacter(len=*) :: s\ninteger :: n = len_trim(s)\ninteger(8), dimension(0:n-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nThen, the loop over i from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe base starts at 1.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_char = s(n - i)  ! because in Java, the character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). Since in Fortran, s is a string of length n, the first character is s(1), last is s(n). So for i=0, the character is s(n -0) = s(n). For i=1, s(n-1), etc. So that's correct.\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses cs[cs.length-1 -i], which is the (original length -1 -i)th index. Since in Fortran, the string is 1-based, so the equivalent is s(n - i).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's cs is a char array of length n. The index is (n-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (index n-1). In Fortran, the last character is s(n). So yes, s(n -i) is correct.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_char = s(n -i)\n\nThen, check if current_char is '?' or a digit.\n\nIf it's '?', then loop over next from 0 to 9.\n\nElse, next is the digit value (current_char - '0').\n\nThen, for each pre in 0 to 12:\n\nFor the '?' case:\n\ndo pre =0, 12\n    do next =0,9\n        new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n        if (i ==0) then\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + 1  ! because previous is pre=0, and initial condition is 1 when pre is 0?\n            Wait, need to re-examine the initial condition.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for the first step (i=0), when i>0 is false, so the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). So for each pre, the contribution is from the previous step (i-1 = -1, which is not part of the array). So for i=0, the previous is only valid when pre was 0 (since the initial state is 0 mod 13 with 1 way).\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0))\n\nSo for i=0, the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). So for each pre, the contribution is 1 if pre was 0 (since previous step is before the first step, which is the initial state). \n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is that before any digits, the mod is 0 with 1 way. So for the first step (i=0), when considering a next digit, the previous mod is pre, and the previous step (i-1 = -1) has dp[-1][pre] which is 1 only if pre is 0. \n\nTherefore, for each next and pre, the contribution is 1 if pre is 0 (since previous step's dp is 1 when pre is 0, else 0).\n\nWait, the code's term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). So for each pre, the term is 1 only when pre is 0. So for the first step, the contribution is 1 only when the previous pre was 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to think is that the previous step (i-1) is the state before adding the current digit. So for the first digit (i=0), the previous state is the initial state (before any digits), which has mod 0 with count 1. So when adding the first digit, the new mod is (base * next + 0) mod13, and the count is added by 1 (since previous count was 1 for pre=0).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex, but in code terms, in Fortran:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (current_char is '?') then\n\n    do pre =0, 12\n        do next =0,9\n            new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n            if (i ==0) then\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (pre ==0 ? 1_8 : 0_8)\n            else\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n            end if\n            dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n        end do\n    end do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the order is that for each pre, and next, the new_mod is computed, and the contribution is added to dp[i][new_mod]. But in Fortran, the loops need to be structured properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be structured as:\n\nfor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    if (current_char is '?') then\n        do pre =0, 12\n            temp = 0_8\n            do next =0,9\n                new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n                if (i ==0) then\n                    temp = temp + (pre ==0 ? 1_8 :0_8)\n                else\n                    temp = temp + dp(i-1, pre)\n                end if\n                ! Wait, no, this is not correct. The contribution for each next is added to the new_mod's entry.\n                ! Hmm, perhaps I need to loop over next first, then pre?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nInitialize the current dp[i] array based on the previous dp[i-1].\n\nFor each possible next digit (0-9 for '?'), and for each possible previous mod (pre), compute the new_mod and accumulate the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\nallocate a temporary array for the current dp[i], then compute it based on the previous.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, since arrays are mutable, perhaps we can loop over pre first, then next, and accumulate.\n\nWait, let me think of the Java code's loops:\n\nfor (pre in 0..12) {\n    for (next in 0..9) {\n        new_mod = (base*next + pre) mod13\n        dp[i][new_mod] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n    }\n}\n\nWait, no, the Java code loops over pre and next, and for each, adds to the new_mod's entry. But in Java, the += is adding to the current dp[i][new_mod], which is initially 0. So for each pre and next, the contribution is added to the new_mod's entry.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loops are:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n    for each next in 0..9:\n\n        new_mod = (base*next + pre) mod13\n\n        dp[i][new_mod] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n        mod MOD\n\nSo for each pre and next, the contribution is added to the new_mod's entry. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for the '?' case:\n\ndo pre =0, 12\n    do next =0,9\n        new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n        contribution = 0_8\n        if (i ==0) then\n            if (pre ==0) then\n                contribution =1_8\n            else\n                contribution =0_8\n            end if\n        else\n            contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n        end if\n        dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n        dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but this would loop over all pre and next, and for each, add the contribution to the new_mod's entry. However, in this way, for each pre and next, the contribution is added to the new_mod's entry. But in the Java code, the loops are over pre and next, so this is correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, the initial dp array is initialized to zero. So before the loops, the dp(i,:) is zero. Then, for each pre and next, the contribution is added to dp(i, new_mod).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the dp array is initialized to zero each time? Or is it cumulative?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is initialized as new long[cs.length][13], so each row is initialized to zero. Then, for each i, the code loops over pre and next, and adds to dp[i][new_mod]. So in Fortran, we need to initialize each row to zero before processing.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each i, the dp[i] array is a new row (since it's a 2D array). So in Fortran, for each i, before processing, we need to set dp(i,:) =0.\n\nAh, right! So in Fortran, for each i, before processing, we must set dp(i, :) =0.\n\nSo the steps for the '?' case would be:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n    current_char = s(n -i:i_char)  ! assuming s is a character array.\n\n    if (current_char == '?') then\n\n        dp(i, :) = 0_8  ! Initialize current row to zero.\n\n        do pre =0, 12\n            do next =0,9\n                new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n                contribution = 0_8\n                if (i ==0) then\n                    if (pre ==0) then\n                        contribution =1_8\n                    else\n                        contribution =0_8\n                    end if\n                else\n                    contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n                end if\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n                dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n            end do\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        ! process fixed digit\n\n        next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        dp(i, :) =0_8\n\n        do pre =0,12\n            new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n            contribution =0_8\n            if (i ==0) then\n                if (pre ==0) then\n                    contribution =1_8\n                else\n                    contribution =0_8\n                end if\n            else\n                contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n            end if\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n            dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the fixed digit case, the next is fixed (next_digit), so the inner loop over next is not needed. So the code for fixed digit is similar but without the next loop.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFinally, the result is dp(n-1,5), since the last index is n-1 (0-based), and we want mod 5.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program will:\n\n1. Read A and B from input.\n\n2. Compute result1.\n\n3. Compute result2 using result1 as position.\n\n4. Convert result2 to a string s.\n\n5. Process s through the DP to get the final result.\n\n6. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: A, B, result1, result2\ninteger(8) :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n\nThen, for the first part:\n\nRead A and B:\n\nread*, A, B\n\nCompute result1:\n\nresult1 = (B-1)/(A-1)\namari = mod(B-1, A-1)\nif (amari /=0) then\n    result1 = result1 +1\nend if\n\nSecond part (compute result2):\n\nWe need to compute result2 using the first program's result1 as the position.\n\nWe need to implement the second Java program's logic.\n\nVariables for the second part:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n\nposition = result1\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1_8\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2_8) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2_8\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\nresult2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nwhere getValueAtIndex is a function:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can be defined inside the program. Alternatively, use an inline function or compute inline.\n\nAlternatively, compute inline to avoid function calls (since it's a simple formula).\n\nSo substituting the function:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nwhile ( (1 + ( (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*2*nrstSeqStartIndx ) /2 ) < position )\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) = 1 + (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*2*nrstSeqStartIndx /2 ?\n\nWait, the formula is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo for index = 2*nrstSeqStartIndx:\n\nvalue = 1 + (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*2*nrstSeqStartIndx /2\n\n= 1 + ( (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*2*nrstSeqStartIndx ) /2 \n\n= 1 + (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*nrstSeqStartIndx \n\nSimilarly for other terms.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute inline.\n\nSo the code for the second part can be written without a function:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1_8\n\ndo while ( (1_8 + ( (2_8*nrstSeqStartIndx -1_8)*2_8*nrstSeqStartIndx ) /2_8 ) < position )\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2_8\nend do\n\nWait, no, the formula is 1 + (index-1)*index/2. So for index = 2*nrstSeqStartIndx:\n\nvalue = 1 + (2*nrstSeqStartIndx -1)* (2*nrstSeqStartIndx) /2 \n\nYes. So in code:\n\ntemp = 2_8 * nrstSeqStartIndx\nvalue = 1_8 + (temp -1_8)*temp /2_8\n\nBut in the loop condition:\n\nwhile ( value < position )\n\nSo perhaps better to compute the value each time.\n\nAlternatively, compute inline in the loop condition.\n\nAlternatively, compute the value each time:\n\ndo while ( (1_8 + ( (2_8*nrstSeqStartIndx -1_8)*2_8*nrstSeqStartIndx ) /2_8 ) < position )\n\nBut this may be cumbersome. Alternatively, compute the value in a temporary variable each time.\n\nAlternatively, use a function. Let me write the function:\n\nfunction getValue(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\nend function\n\nThen, in the loops:\n\ndo while ( getValue(2_8*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position )\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2_8\nend do\n\ndo while ( getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position )\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx)\nresult2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nThis is cleaner.\n\nNow, the third part: converting result2 to a string and processing.\n\nFirst, convert result2 to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result2\ns = adjustl(s)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, process s through the DP.\n\nThe length n is len_trim(s).\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate the dp array:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:n-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nBut in Fortran, we can't have variable-length arrays unless using allocatable. So we need to declare dp as allocatable.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible result2 is up to the maximum of the second program's output. But since the second program's input can be up to very large (since it's a long), but in practice, the third program's input is a string, which can be up to some length. However, in Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate( dp(0:n-1, 0:12) )\n\nThen initialize dp to zero.\n\nBut in the loops, for each i, we set dp(i,:) =0 before processing.\n\nWait, in the code outline above, for each i, before processing, we set dp(i,:) =0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n    current_char = s(n -i:i_char)  ! Wait, in Fortran, s is a character string. To get the (n-i)th character:\n\n    current_char = s(n -i:i)  ! Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nWait, s is a character string of length n. The characters are s(1), s(2), ..., s(n). \n\nThe current character for i=0 is s(n), for i=1 is s(n-1), etc.\n\nSo current_char = s(n -i)\n\nWait, in Fortran, s is a character array, so s(n-i) is the correct character.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the substring s(1: len_trim(s)) is the actual string. So for the i-th step (0-based), the character is s(n -i).\n\nWait, for example, if n=5, then for i=0, it's s(5), i=1: s(4), etc.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_char = s(n -i:i)  ? No, just s(n -i)\n\nWait, in Fortran, s is a character variable, so s(n-i) is the character at position n-i.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices start at 1. So for s being a string of length n, s(1) is first character, s(n) is last.\n\nThus, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_char = s(n -i)\n\nWait, when i=0: n -0 =n \u2192 s(n) \u2192 last character.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_char = s(n -i:i) \u2192 no, just s(n -i)\n\nWait, in Fortran, s is a character variable, so s(n-i) is the correct character.\n\nNow, processing the current_char:\n\nif (current_char == '?') then\n\n    ! process as ?\n\nelse\n\n    ! process as digit\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, comparing characters:\n\nif (current_char == achar(63)) then ...  (since '?' is ASCII 63)\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nif (current_char == '?') then ... \n\nBut in Fortran, the character literals are case-sensitive and need to be in quotes.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the comparison is:\n\nif (current_char == '?') then\n\nYes, that's okay.\n\nNow, the code for the third part:\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate( dp(0:n-1, 0:12) )\n\nbase =1_8\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n    current_char = s(n -i)\n\n    if (current_char == '?') then\n\n        dp(i, :) = 0_8\n\n        do pre =0, 12\n            do next =0,9\n                new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n                contribution =0_8\n                if (i ==0) then\n                    if (pre ==0) then\n                        contribution =1_8\n                    else\n                        contribution =0_8\n                    end if\n                else\n                    contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n                end if\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n                dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n            end do\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        ! it's a digit\n        next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        dp(i, :) =0_8\n\n        do pre =0,12\n            new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n            contribution =0_8\n            if (i ==0) then\n                if (pre ==0) then\n                    contribution =1_8\n                else\n                    contribution =0_8\n                end if\n            else\n                contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n            end if\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n            dp(i, new_mod) = mod( dp(i, new_mod), MOD )\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10_8, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nThe final result is dp(n-1,5).\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nprint*, dp(n-1,5)\n\nNow, putting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nBut need to make sure all variables are declared properly.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, functions must be declared before use, or in a module.
