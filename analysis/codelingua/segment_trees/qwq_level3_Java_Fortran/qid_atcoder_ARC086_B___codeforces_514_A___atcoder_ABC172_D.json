So the first element is the least significant digit, so when building the number, we can just process them in order, multiplying by 10^pow each time. Wait, let's see: In Java:\n\nnewNumber starts at 0.\n\nfor each digit in list (from first to last):\n\nnewNumber += digit * 10^pow\n\npow +=1\n\nSo the first digit (LSB) is added as digit *1, then next as digit *10, etc. Therefore, in Fortran, the digits array can be stored in the same order (LSB first), and then the newNumber is computed as:\n\nnewNumber = 0\n\npow =1 (or 10^0, 10^1, etc.) Wait, let's see: Initialize newNumber =0\n\npow =1 (10^0)\n\nfor i from 1 to num_digits:\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*pow\n\n   pow = pow *10\n\nSo yes.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ARC086_B) reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. It then finds the index m of the element with the largest absolute value. Then, it creates a list of pairs (m+1, i+1) where the signs of a[m] and a[i] are different. Depending on whether a[m] is non-negative or negative, it adds more pairs either by moving right or left. Finally, it outputs the count and the list.\n\nThe second file (codeforces_514_A) takes a number x, processes each digit, and constructs a new number where each digit is replaced by the smaller of the digit or 9 minus the digit. Then it reverses the digits (since it was collected in reverse order) and outputs the new number.\n\nThe third file (atcoder_ABC172_D) takes an integer n and calculates a sum involving divisors, then outputs the result.\n\nThe key is to chain their outputs. The first program's output is a list of pairs, which is then the input for the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a single number. Wait, looking at the second Java code, it reads a long x from input. But the first program's output is multiple lines. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a single number as input. The first program's output is multiple lines: first the count, then the pairs. So that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's output: it prints the size of the list (number of pairs), then each pair on a separate line. The second program's input is a single long x. So the first program's output is multiple lines, but the second program expects a single number. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but maybe only part of it? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a single number. So the first program's output must be a single number? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the list of pairs, but the second program is expecting a number. That doesn't align. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program (codeforces_514_A), it reads a single long x. So the input to the second program must be a single number. But the first program's output is multiple lines. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but maybe the first program's output is the input to the second's input? That can't be. Unless the first program's output is a single number. Wait, let me check the first program again.\n\nThe first program's output is the size of the list (number of pairs) followed by the pairs. So the first line is an integer, then the rest are pairs. The second program reads a long x, which is a single number. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but maybe the first program's output is the input to the second's input? That would require that the second program reads the first line (the count) as x, but then the rest of the lines would be ignored. But that's not how the second program works. The second program processes all digits of x. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's output's first line? But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program, but the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x, and ignores the rest. But that would mean that the second program's input is the count from the first program. Then the third program would take the output of the second (the modified number) as its input. But the third program expects an integer n. So the second program's output is a number, which is then the input to the third program. \n\nWait, the third program's input is an integer n. So the second program's output must be that integer. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is a list of pairs, but the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x. Then the second program processes that count (as x) and outputs a new number. Then the third program takes that number as its input n and computes the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the list of pairs, but the second program is supposed to read all of them, but that's not possible because the second program expects a single number. So this suggests that there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's output's first line (the count). Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the list of pairs, but the second program is supposed to read the entire output as a single number? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's output's first line (the count). Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs:\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nThen the second program would read the first line (3) as x, process it, and output a new number. Then the third program takes that number as n. That would make sense. So the first program's output is the count (the first line) followed by the pairs, but the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x. The rest of the lines are ignored. Then the second program processes that x (the count) and outputs a new number, which is then the input to the third program. The third program takes that number as n and computes the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the list of pairs, but the second program is supposed to read the entire output as a single number? That's not possible. So perhaps the first program's output is the count, and the rest is not used. So the second program's input is the count from the first program. Then the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a number derived from the count. \n\nAssuming that's the case, then the first program's output is the count (the first line) followed by the pairs. The second program reads the first line (the count) as x, processes it, and outputs a new number. The third program takes that number as n and computes the sum. \n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first program outputs count and pairs \u2192 second program reads the count (as x) \u2192 processes it \u2192 outputs a number \u2192 third program reads that number as n \u2192 computes the sum.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first block (equivalent to first Java program) must read the input, compute the count (the first output line), and then the second block (second Java program) must process that count as x, and the third block (third Java program) must process the result of the second as n. The intermediate steps (the pairs from first program) are not used, so they can be ignored in the Fortran code.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is the count followed by the pairs. The second program only needs the count. So in the Fortran code, the first part (equivalent to first Java program) must compute the count and the pairs, but only the count is needed for the next step. The pairs are not used beyond the first program's output. But since the second program only reads the count, the rest of the output from the first program is irrelevant for the second program. Therefore, in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the count (the number of pairs) and the pairs, but only the count is passed to the second part. The pairs are not needed beyond the first part's output, but since in the Fortran program we are not outputting anything until the end, we can ignore the pairs except for computing the count. Wait, but the count is part of the first program's output. However, in the Fortran program, the first block must read the input, compute the count and the pairs, but only the count is needed for the next steps. The rest (the pairs) are part of the first program's output but not used further. Since the second program only reads the count, the rest of the first program's output is irrelevant for the chain. Therefore, in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the count (the number of pairs) and the pairs (for the first program's output), but since the second program only needs the count, the rest can be ignored except for the count. Wait, but in the Fortran program, the first block must read the input, compute the count and the pairs, but the second block (equivalent to the second Java program) must process the count as x. The third block (third Java program) processes the output of the second as n. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (n and array a) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the count (number of pairs) and the pairs (but not output them yet).\n\n3. Then, process the count (as x) through the second program's logic.\n\n4. Then, take the result of that (the new number) and process it through the third program's logic.\n\n5. Finally, output the result of the third program.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the count followed by the pairs. The second program's input is the first program's output, which is the count followed by the pairs. But the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x. The rest is ignored. So in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the count (the number of pairs) and the pairs (for the first program's output), but since the second program only needs the count, the rest can be ignored except for the count. Therefore, in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the count (the number of pairs) and the pairs (but not store them except for the count). The second part takes the count as x, processes it, and outputs the new number. The third part takes that number as n and computes the sum. The final output is the sum from the third part.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the count followed by the pairs. The second program's input is the first program's output, which is the count followed by the pairs. But the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x. The rest is not read. So in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the count (the number of pairs) and the pairs (but not output them yet). The second part takes the count as x, processes it, and the third part takes the result as n. The final output is the third part's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (n and array a) in the first block.\n\n- Compute the count (number of pairs) and the pairs (but not output them yet).\n\n- Then, process the count through the second program's logic (the codeforces_514_A logic).\n\n- Then, take the result of that (the new number) and process it through the third program's logic (the ABC172_D logic).\n\n- Finally, output the result of the third program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and array a.\n\n2. Find m (index of element with largest absolute value).\n\n3. Count the number of pairs where a[m] and a[i] have different signs. Let's call this count1.\n\n4. Depending on a[m]'s sign, add more pairs (either moving right or left). The total count is count1 plus the added pairs.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first part of the list (r) is the pairs where the signs differ. Then, if a[m] is non-negative, it adds pairs between consecutive elements from 1 to n-1 (so n-1 pairs). If a[m] is negative, it adds pairs between consecutive elements from n down to 2 (also n-1 pairs). So the total count is the initial count (count1) plus (n-1).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe first loop adds all i where the signs are different between a[m] and a[i]. Let's say that's count1 elements. Then, the second loop (either the forward or backward) adds (n-1) pairs. So the total size is count1 + (n-1).\n\nWait, the code for the first part:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) if (a[m] >= 0 ^ a[i] >= 0) r.add(...)\n\nSo that's count1 = number of such i's.\n\nThen, if a[m] >=0, the next loop adds (n-1) pairs (from 1 to n-1 steps, so n-1 pairs). So total is count1 + (n-1).\n\nSimilarly, if a[m] is negative, the loop adds (n-1) pairs as well.\n\nSo the total count is count1 + (n-1).\n\nBut the first program's output is the size of r, which is exactly that.\n\nBut for the second program's input, the first program's output is the count (the size of r) followed by the pairs. But the second program only reads the first line (the count) as x. So the second program's x is the total count (count1 + (n-1)).\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the first program's output, which is the count followed by the pairs. The second program reads x as the first line (the count). So the second program's x is the total count of pairs from the first program.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the total count (count_total = count1 + (n-1)), then the second part processes that count_total as x, and the third part uses the result of that as n.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n and array a.\n\nCompute m (index of max absolute value).\n\nCompute count1: number of elements where a(m) and a(i) have different signs.\n\nCompute count_total = count1 + (n-1).\n\nThen, process count_total through the second program's logic (codeforces_514_A), which takes x = count_total and outputs a new number.\n\nThen, take that new number as n for the third program (ABC172_D), compute the sum, and output it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n and array a.\n\n2. Find m (the index with maximum absolute value).\n\n3. Compute count1 (number of elements with opposite sign to a(m)).\n\n4. Compute count_total = count1 + (n-1).\n\n5. Process count_total through the second program's logic (the digit processing).\n\n6. Take the result of that as n for the third program.\n\n7. Compute the sum for that n and output it.\n\nNow, let's think about each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (equivalent to first Java program):\n\nRead n and array a (1-based? In Java, arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based. Need to adjust indices accordingly.)\n\nWait, in Java, the array a is 0-based. The code uses m as the index (starting from 0). The pairs are m+1 and i+1 (so 1-based in output). But in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based, so perhaps easier to use 1-based indices.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array a(1:n).\n\nFind m (the index of the element with maximum absolute value). Initialize m to 1, then loop from 2 to n, comparing absolute values.\n\nThen compute count1: loop over all i from 1 to n, count how many have a(m) and a(i) with different signs. The condition is (a(m) >=0) .neqv. (a(i)>=0). Because in Java, the XOR is between the two conditions.\n\nThen count_total = count1 + (n-1).\n\nSecond part (equivalent to codeforces_514_A):\n\nTake x = count_total (as an integer, but in the second Java program, it's a long. Since count_total can be up to (n-1) + (n-1) (if all elements have opposite signs to a(m)), but n can be up to 1e5 or something? Wait, but in the first Java program, n is the input, but the second program's input is the count_total. However, in the second Java program, x is a long, so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 or similar.\n\nWait, in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Let's use integer*8 variables for x and the newNumber.\n\nThe second part's logic:\n\nx is count_total (as integer*8).\n\nWe need to process each digit of x, replacing each digit d with min(d, 9-d). Then reverse the digits (since the digits are collected in reverse order in the Java code).\n\nWait, let's see the Java code for the second program:\n\nThe code does:\n\nlong x = sc.nextLong();\n\nthen while x>0:\n\nr = x mod 10\n\nif (x/10 ==0 and 9 - r ==0) then list.add(r) else list.add(9 - r if 9-r < r else r?)\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 and 9 - r ==0) then list.add(r)\n\nelse list.add(9 - r)\n\nelse list.add(r)\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 and 9 - r ==0) \u2192 add r (so not replacing?)\n\nElse, add 9 - r.\n\nElse add r.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to avoid leading zeros? Because if the last digit (the first digit of the original number) is 9, then 9 - r would be 0, but if it's the last digit (the first digit of the original number), then adding 0 would make it a leading zero, which is not allowed. So in that case, it keeps the original digit.\n\nWait, let me parse the code:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\nlong x = sc.nextLong();\n\nList<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();\n\nwhile (x >0) {\n\n    long r = x%10;\n\n    if (9 - r < r) {\n\n        if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r (so not replacing)\n\n        else \u2192 add (9 - r)\n\n    } else \u2192 add r\n\n    x = x/10;\n\n}\n\nThen, the list is built in reverse order (since we process digits from least to most significant). Then, the newNumber is constructed by taking the list elements in order (so the first element is the least significant digit, but when building the number, the first element is multiplied by 10^0, next by 10^1, etc. So the list is stored in reverse order of the digits. Wait, no, the list is built by taking the last digit first, then the next, etc. So the list's first element is the last digit of x, then the second is the second last, etc. So when building the newNumber, the first element is the least significant digit, so the order is correct.\n\nWait, the code loops while x>0, so for x=123:\n\nFirst iteration: x=123 \u2192 r=3 \u2192 add 3 (since 9-3=6 <3? No, 6 is not less than 3. Wait 9-3 is 6, which is greater than 3. So the condition 9-r < r is 6 <3 \u2192 false. So add r (3). Then x becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: r=2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 add 2. x becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration: r=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 add 1. x becomes 0.\n\nSo list is [3,2,1], then newNumber is 3*10^0 + 2*10^1 +1*10^2 \u2192 123. So the code leaves it as is.\n\nAnother example: x= 999.\n\nFirst iteration: r=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. Then check if x/10 (99) is 0? No. So add 0. list has 0.\n\nSecond iteration: x=99 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 same \u2192 add 0. list [0,0].\n\nThird iteration: x=9 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. Check if x/10 is 0 (9/10 is 0.9 \u2192 integer division gives 0). So yes, and 9 -r is 0. So the condition is (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0 \u2192 yes. So add r (9). So list becomes [0,0,9].\n\nThen newNumber is 0*1 +0*10 +9*100 \u2192 900. So the code would output 900 for input 999.\n\nWait, but the code's logic for the last digit (the first digit of the original number) is to avoid leading zeros. So when the remaining x is the first digit (x/10 ==0), and 9 - r is 0 (so the digit is 9), then it adds r (9) instead of 0. So the first digit (most significant) is kept as 9, so the number doesn't get a leading zero.\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this:\n\nWe need to process each digit of x (count_total) as follows:\n\nInitialize list as an array of digits (or a list). But in Fortran, perhaps we can process the digits and build the new number directly.\n\nAlternatively, process each digit, collect them in an array, then compute the new number.\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\nInitialize newNumber as 0.\n\nInitialize pow as 0 (the power of 10 for each digit).\n\nBut first, we need to process each digit of x, starting from the least significant digit (right to left).\n\nWait, the code in Java processes the digits from right to left (since it takes mod 10 each time). So the first digit processed is the last digit of x.\n\nWe can do the same in Fortran.\n\nBut how to get each digit?\n\nWe can loop while x >0:\n\ndigit = mod(x,10)\n\nthen process digit.\n\nBut need to handle the condition as in Java.\n\nWait, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, x is count_total (as integer*8).\n\nWe need to collect the digits in a list (array), then process them.\n\nAlternatively, process each digit and build the new number step by step.\n\nWait, the code in Java first collects the digits (after processing) in a list, then builds the new number by iterating over the list and multiplying by 10^pow.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps it's easier to collect the processed digits in an array, then compute the new number.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize an array of digits (digits array), and a counter for the number of digits.\n\nLoop while x >0:\n\ndigit = mod(x,10)\n\nprocess digit to get the new digit (d):\n\nif (9 - digit < digit):\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 and (9 - digit) ==0):\n\n       d = digit\n\n   else:\n\n       d = 9 - digit\n\nelse:\n\n   d = digit\n\nAdd d to the digits array (append to the list).\n\nThen x = x /10\n\nOnce all digits are processed, the digits array has the processed digits in reverse order (since we started from the least significant digit). So to build the new number, we need to reverse the digits array and compute the number.\n\nWait, no. Because in the Java code, the digits are stored in the list in the order of processing (LSB first), then when building the newNumber, each digit is multiplied by 10^pow, so the first digit (LSB) is multiplied by 10^0, next by 10^1, etc. So the digits array in Fortran would be stored in the same order as the list in Java. So the first element is the least significant digit, so when building the number, we can just process them in order, multiplying by 10^pow each time.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nnewNumber starts at 0.\n\nfor each digit in list (from first to last):\n\nnewNumber += digit * 10^pow\n\npow +=1\n\nSo the first digit (LSB) is added as digit *1, then next as digit *10, etc.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the digits array can be stored in the same order (LSB first), and then the newNumber is computed as:\n\nnewNumber = 0\n\npow =1 (or 10^0, 10^1, etc.)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize newNumber =0\n\npow =1 (10^0)\n\nfor i from 1 to num_digits:\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*pow\n\n   pow = pow *10\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nWe can collect the processed digits in an array (digits), then compute newNumber as above.\n\nNow, handling the condition for the first digit (the most significant digit of the original x):\n\nWhen processing the digit (the current digit is the current remainder mod 10), we need to check if this is the last digit (i.e., after division by 10, x becomes 0). So before processing the digit, we can check if x//10 ==0 (integer division).\n\nWait, in the loop:\n\ndigit = mod(x,10)\n\noriginal_x = x\n\nx = x /10\n\nthen, after division, check if original_x /10 ==0 \u2192 which is equivalent to (original_x <10). Because if original_x was, say, 9, then x becomes 0, so original_x//10 is 0.\n\nWait, original_x is the value before division. So to check if this digit is the first (most significant) digit of the original x, we can check if after division, x becomes 0. So after division, if x ==0, then the previous digit was the first digit.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose x was 123:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ndigit =3 \u2192 x becomes 12 \u2192 not zero \u2192 not the first digit.\n\nSecond iteration: digit=2 \u2192 x becomes 1 \u2192 not zero.\n\nThird iteration: digit=1 \u2192 x becomes 0 \u2192 yes, so this is the first digit.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndigit = mod(x,10)\n\noriginal_x = x\n\nx = x /10\n\nthen, if (original_x /10 ==0) \u2192 which is equivalent to (x ==0 after division? No, original_x /10 is (original_x - digit)/10 \u2192 but perhaps better to check if x (after division) is zero.\n\nWait, after division, x is original_x divided by 10. So if x is zero, then the previous digit was the first digit.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (x ==0) then \u2192 this digit is the first digit (most significant).\n\nWait, but in the first iteration, after division, x is 12 \u2192 not zero.\n\nIn the third iteration, after division, x is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the condition for the first digit is (x ==0 after division).\n\nWait, but in the code, the condition in Java is:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 \u2192 before division? Or after?\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nlong r = x%10;\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r.\n\nSo the check is on the current x (before division). So in Java, the condition is (x divided by 10 is zero \u2192 meaning that the current digit is the first digit (most significant digit) of the original x).\n\nSo in Fortran, before dividing x by 10, we can check if (original_x /10) ==0 \u2192 which is equivalent to (original_x <10).\n\nWait, original_x is the value of x before division. So:\n\ndigit = mod(x,10)\n\noriginal_x = x\n\nx = x /10\n\nthen, the condition is (original_x /10 ==0) \u2192 which is (original_x <10).\n\nSo in code:\n\nif ( (original_x /10) ==0 ) then \u2192 yes, it's the first digit.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger*8 :: x, newNumber, digit, original_x, temp_x\n\ninteger :: num_digits =0\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n\nx = count_total\n\nallocate(digits(1: ... )) \u2192 but we can dynamically grow, but in Fortran, perhaps better to first count the digits, then allocate.\n\nAlternatively, first count the number of digits, then allocate.\n\nBut to avoid multiple passes, perhaps:\n\nWe can first count the number of digits:\n\ntemp_x = x\n\nnum_digits =0\n\ndo while (temp_x >0)\n\n   temp_x = temp_x /10\n\n   num_digits = num_digits +1\n\nend do\n\nallocate(digits(num_digits))\n\nthen, reset temp_x to x, and process each digit.\n\nWait, but this requires two passes. Alternatively, process the digits, store them in an array, and track the index.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nInitialize:\n\nx = count_total\n\nnum_digits =0\n\nallocate(digits(1: 20)) \u2192 assuming x is not too big (since count_total is count1 + (n-1). If n is up to 1e5, then count_total could be up to 2e5, which is 6 digits. So 20 is enough.\n\nBut better to use a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's process the digits, storing them in an array, and track the current index.\n\nInitialize:\n\ninteger :: idx =0\n\ndigits array can be a dynamic array, but in Fortran, perhaps better to use a large enough array.\n\nLet me proceed with code steps:\n\ndigits array:\n\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits\n\nidx =0\n\nx_initial = x\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n   digit = mod(x,10)\n\n   original_x = x\n\n   x = x /10\n\n   ! process digit\n\n   if (9 - digit < digit) then\n\n      if ( (original_x /10) ==0 .and. (9 - digit) ==0 ) then\n\n         d = digit\n\n      else\n\n         d = 9 - digit\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      d = digit\n\n   end if\n\n   idx = idx +1\n\n   digits(idx) = d\n\nend do\n\nnum_digits = idx\n\nThen, compute newNumber:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\npow =1\n\ndo i=1, num_digits\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*pow\n\n   pow = pow *10\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the second part.\n\nThird part (equivalent to third Java program):\n\nTake the newNumber (as integer*8) and compute the sum as per the third program.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nlong ans =0;\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n   ans += (long)i * ( (long)n/(long)i ) * ( (long)n/(long)i +1 ) /2;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nn = newNumber\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   quotient = n /i\n\n   ans = ans + i * quotient * (quotient +1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to ensure that the variables are integers.\n\nWait, variables:\n\nn is integer*8 (since newNumber is integer*8).\n\ni is integer (from 1 to n).\n\nquotient = n /i \u2192 integer division.\n\nThen, the term is i * quotient * (quotient +1)/2 \u2192 but since quotient*(quotient+1) is even, so division by 2 is exact.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ninteger*8 :: ans, n, i, quotient\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   quotient = n /i\n\n   ans = ans + i * quotient * (quotient +1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all parts into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n and array a.\n\n2. Find m (index of maximum absolute value).\n\n3. Compute count1 (number of elements with opposite sign to a(m)).\n\n4. Compute count_total = count1 + (n-1).\n\n5. Process count_total through the second part's logic to get newNumber.\n\n6. Process newNumber through the third part's logic to get ans.\n\n7. Output ans.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part (reading and processing the first Java program):\n\nRead n and array a.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(a(1:n))\n\nread *, a(1:n)\n\nThen, find m (index of maximum absolute value):\n\ninteger :: m, max_abs_val, current_abs\n\nmax_abs_val = abs(a(1))\n\nm =1\n\ndo i=2, n\n\n   current_abs = abs(a(i))\n\n   if (current_abs > max_abs_val) then\n\n      max_abs_val = current_abs\n\n      m =i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen compute count1:\n\ninteger :: count1=0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if ( (a(m) >=0) .neqv.

No, in Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop. So the correct code would be:\n\n  !

So in the code above, they are declared inside the do loop, which is not allowed. So the correct way is to declare them before the loop.\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\n  !

No, the code as written has them declared before the loop. Wait, in the code I wrote, the 'integer :: digit, original_x' is inside the second part's code block, but before the loop. So that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInside the program:\n\nAfter the first part, the second part starts with:\n\n  !

So in the program's main block, after the declarations of other variables, we can declare digit and original_x here?\n\nWait, no. In Fortran, all variables must be declared at the beginning of the program unit (before any executable statements). So the code as written has variables declared in the middle of the code, which is invalid.\n\nAh, right! That's a problem. So all variables must be declared at the top.\n\nSo I need to adjust the code to declare all variables at the beginning.\n\nLet me restructure the code with all variables declared at the top.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, m, i, count1, idx, num_digits\n  integer*8 :: count_total, x, newNumber, ans, quotient\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n  integer, dimension(20) :: digits\n  integer :: digit, original_x  ! declare here\n\n  !

Rest of the code...\n\nThis way, all variables are declared at the top.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the second part's loop, when x becomes zero, the loop exits. The digits array is filled with the processed digits in the order of least significant to most (since we process from the end). The newNumber is built correctly.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program's count_total is 123.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx=123 \u2192 digit=3 \u2192 9-3=6 <3? No (6>3). So d=3. x becomes 12 \u2192 idx=1.\n\nNext iteration: x=12 \u2192 digit=2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 d=2. x becomes 1 \u2192 idx=2.\n\nNext iteration: x=1 \u2192 digit=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 d=1. x becomes 0 \u2192 idx=3.\n\ndigits array is [3,2,1]. newNumber is 3*1 +2*10 +1*100 \u2192 123. So the second program leaves it as is.\n\nAnother example: count_total=999.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx=999 \u2192 digit=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. Check if original_x/10 (999/10=99.9 \u2192 integer division gives 99) \u2192 99 !=0 \u2192 so d=0. x becomes 99 \u2192 idx=1.\n\nx=99 \u2192 digit=9 \u2192 0 <9 \u2192 yes. original_x/10 is 9 \u2192 not zero \u2192 d=0. x becomes 9 \u2192 idx=2.\n\nx=9 \u2192 digit=9 \u2192 0 <9 \u2192 yes. original_x/10 is 0 (since 9/10=0.9 \u2192 integer division is 0). So check if 9-9 ==0 \u2192 yes. So d=9. x becomes 0 \u2192 idx=3.\n\ndigits array is [0,0,9]. newNumber is 0*1 +0*10 +9*100 \u2192 900. Which matches the Java code's example.\n\nAnother test case: count_total= 9 \u2192 x=9.\n\ndigit=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. original_x/10 is 0 \u2192 so check if 9-9 ==0 \u2192 yes \u2192 so d=9. x becomes 0 \u2192 idx=1.\n\nnewNumber is 9 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: count_total= 10 \u2192 x=10.\n\nFirst iteration: x=10 \u2192 digit=0 \u2192 9-0=9>0 \u2192 so d=0. x becomes 1 \u2192 idx=1.\n\nSecond iteration: x=1 \u2192 digit=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 d=1. x becomes 0 \u2192 idx=2.\n\ndigits array [0,1]. newNumber is 0*1 +1*10 \u2192 10.\n\nWait, but the original x was 10. The code would process:\n\ndigit=0 (from 10 mod10 \u21920). 9-0=9>0 \u2192 so d=0. Then x becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: digit=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 d=1. So digits are [0,1]. newNumber is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the code leaves it as 10.\n\nBut according to the second program's logic, for x=10:\n\nThe digits are 0 and 1 (from 10 \u2192 digits 0 and 1).\n\nProcessing first digit (0):\n\n9-0=9>0 \u2192 so d=0. \n\nThen next digit (1):\n\n9-1=8>1 \u2192 d=1.\n\nSo the new number is 10 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case: x= 19 \u2192 count_total=19.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx=19 \u2192 digit=9 \u2192 0 <9 \u2192 yes. original_x/10 is 1 (19/10=1.9 \u2192 integer division 1). So not zero \u2192 d=0. x becomes 1 \u2192 idx=1.\n\nNext iteration: x=1 \u2192 digit=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 d=1. x becomes 0 \u2192 idx=2.\n\ndigits array [0,1]. newNumber is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the new number is 10.\n\nWhich is correct because 19 \u2192 digits 9 and 1. The first digit (9) is processed as 0 (since 9-9=0 <9, and original_x/10 is 1 (not zero), so 0. The second digit (1) becomes 1 (since 9-1=8>1 \u2192 no, wait 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 so d=1. So the new number is 0 followed by 1 \u2192 10.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the third part: for newNumber = n, compute the sum.\n\nThe third program's code is straightforward.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together with proper variable declarations and structure."
