The code looks for the smallest number made of 4 and 7 with equal counts, and >= number. The approach is to generate numbers by converting binary masks (starting from 2) to binary strings, then check if the number of 0s and 1s are equal (excluding the first character?), then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and track the first such value >= input. So in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n   - Read the input (from the second step's output, which is an integer, so cast to integer(8)).\n\n   - Initialize variables: ans = -1, value = 0, mask starts at 2.\n\n   - Loop while value < number:\n\n     a. Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting at position 2 (since in Java substring(1) is from index 1, which is the second character in 0-based).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. But since they are in sequence, I have to figure out how the outputs and inputs connect between them. Wait, but the user says the entire sequence is executed in order, with each program's output as the next's input. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final Fortran program should process all three steps in sequence without I/O in the middle.\n\nHmm, but looking at the Java code, each program might not actually produce output that's used by the next. Wait, maybe I need to check each program's output. Let me look at each Java file's main function.\n\nFirst Java file (AGC004_B): The main method reads N, x, and a list of numbers. It does some calculations and then prints the minimum of the result list. So its output is a single number, the minimum value.\n\nSecond Java file (ABC124_C): The main method reads a string, processes it, and outputs the minimum between a1 and a2. So its output is a single integer.\n\nThird Java file (codeforces_96_B): Reads a number, then finds a 4 and 7 number, and outputs that value. Its output is a number.\n\nWait, but how do these connect? The first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third? Or maybe each program is supposed to be run in sequence with their own inputs? Wait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the entire sequence's input is the input to the first program, and the final output is the third program's output. So the Fortran program must read the initial input, process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (AGC004_B).\n2. Compute the first step's result (the minimum value).\n3. Use that result as the input for the second Java program (ABC124_C), which expects a string input. Wait, but the second program's input is a string (the first line is read as a string via in.next() in the solve method). Wait, the second Java program's input is a single string, which is the input for the problem. Wait, the second program's input is a string, but the first program's output is a number. So that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Maybe each program is supposed to be run in sequence with their own inputs, but the user's instruction says the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a string input, but the first outputs a number. That would be a problem. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual problem each Java program is solving.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the three Java programs are not connected in a chain but are separate, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and chain them? But the user's instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the three Java programs are in a sequence where each's output is the next's input. But looking at the code:\n\nFirst program (AGC004_B) outputs a single number (the minimum of the result list). The second program (ABC124_C) expects a string input (the first line is read as a string via in.next() in its solve method). So the first program's output (a number) would be the input to the second, but the second expects a string. That would mean the second program's input is that number as a string. Then the second program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the third program. The third program expects a long number as input (since it reads a long via in.nextLong()). So the third program's input is the second's output (the integer as a string? Or as a number?).\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program as a string. The second program processes that string (the number as a string) and outputs an integer. Then that integer is passed as input to the third program, which reads it as a long. The third program then processes it and outputs a number.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (the first Java's input).\n- Compute the first step's output (the minimum value).\n- Use that value as the input for the second program's processing (so the second program's input is the first's output as a string).\n- Then take the second's output (the integer) and use it as the input for the third program (as a long).\n- Finally, output the third program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (N, x, list of N longs).\n2. Compute the first step's result (min value).\n3. Use that min value as the input to the second step (so the second step's input is the string representation of that min value).\n4. Compute the second step's result (the minimum between a1 and a2).\n5. Use that result as the input to the third step (as a long).\n6. Compute the third step's result and output it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence, passing data between them without I/O in between.\n\nNow, translating each Java program into Fortran functions, with the first reading input, the last producing output, and the intermediates processing data.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each Java program's logic.\n\nFirst Java program (AGC004_B):\n\nThe first program reads N, x, then a list of N longs (srimeList). Then it initializes a 2D array costList of size N x N. For each i from 0 to N-1, costList[i][0] = srimeList[i]. Then for each castNum from 1 to N-1, costList[i][castNum] is the minimum between costList[i][castNum-1] and srimeList[(i - castNum + N) % N]. Then, for each i, compute the sum over all costList[j][i] (since for each j, the j-th element's costList[j][i] is part of the sum?), wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the code for the result is:\n\nresult.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\nWait, the variable j is set to i (final int j = i;). So for each i, the sum is over all costArray[j], where j is i. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nWait, the loop is for each i in 0..N-1:\n\nresult.add( i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum() )\n\nWait, j is set to i (final int j = i;). So for each costArray in costList (each row), we take costArray[j], which is costArray[i]. So the sum is the sum of costList[0][i], costList[1][i], ..., costList[N-1][i]. So for each column i, sum all the elements in that column, then add i*x. Then the minimum of all these values is printed.\n\nSo the first program's output is the minimum of (i*x + sum over all rows' i-th column) for each i from 0 to N-1.\n\nSecond Java program (ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string x. The program creates two copies (a and b). For a, it iterates from the second character to the end, and if two consecutive characters are the same, it flips the current character (0 to 1 or vice versa), counting the number of changes (a1). For b, it starts from the end and goes backward, flipping the previous character if they are the same, counting a2. The output is the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nThird Java program (codeforces_96_B):\n\nThe input is a number (number). The program looks for the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 digits such that the count of 4s and 7s is equal, and the number is >= the input. The mask starts at 2, and for each mask, it converts to binary (without leading zeros?), takes substring from index 1 (so removing the first character?), then checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and if it's >= the input, track the minimum such value. The loop continues until value exceeds the input, then outputs the found value.\n\nWait, the code for the third program:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time. The binary string is obtained via Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1). So for mask=2 (binary 10), substring(1) is \"0\". Then, the zeros count must equal the 1s. Wait, the code checks if zeros != (length - zeros). So if zeros equals (length - zeros), then it's okay. So the number of 0s must equal the number of 1s. So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0s and 1s. Then, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, making a number composed of 4 and 7 with equal counts. The value is parsed as a long, and if it's >= the input number, then it's a candidate. The loop continues until value exceeds the input, but the code is a bit tricky. The loop continues while value < number, so once value exceeds, it breaks. The ans is set to the first such value found? Or the minimal one? The code initializes ans as -1, and when value >= number, it would set ans to value? Wait, no. The code's loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) { ... }\n\nInside the loop, it computes the binary string, checks if zeros equal the count of 1s (since zeros = number of 0s, and length - zeros is 1s). So if zeros == (length - zeros), then proceed. Then, create the s string with 4 and 7, parse to value. But the loop continues as long as value < number. Wait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input. So the code is trying to find the first such value that is >= the input? Because once value is >=, the loop stops. But the code's ans is set to -1, and inside the loop, when a valid s is found, the value is computed, but the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect? Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nint mask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n    int zeros = 0;\n\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\n    if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\n    s = s.replace('0', '4');\n\n    s = s.replace('1', '7');\n\n    value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nSo the loop runs while value is less than the input number. Inside, for each mask, it computes s, checks if the 0s and 1s are equal. If so, compute the value. But the value is set to the parsed s. However, the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. So the loop stops when value >= number. But the code then prints value. So the first value found that is >= the input and meets the criteria is the answer. Because once the value is >=, the loop stops, and the next step is to print value. So the code's output is the first such value that is >= the input. But the problem might require the minimal such value >= the input. So that's correct.\n\nNow, translating all this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program (AGC004_B). The first program's input is N, x, followed by N numbers. So in Fortran, we need to read N, x (as integer and integer*8?), then read N integers (or longs, which in Fortran would be 8-byte integers, so integer(8)).\n\nThen, compute the first step's result (the minimum value as per the first program's logic).\n\nThen, that minimum value is the input to the second program (ABC124_C). The second program's input is a string. So the minimum value from the first step must be converted to a string and passed as the input to the second step's processing. The second program's processing will process that string and output an integer (the minimum between a1 and a2).\n\nThen, that integer is the input to the third program (codeforces_96_B), which expects a long (so in Fortran, integer(8)). The third program processes it and outputs the desired value.\n\nFinally, the Fortran program must output the result of the third step.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement each step in Fortran without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, x, and the list of N numbers (srimeList).\n\n2. Compute the first step's result (min_val):\n\n   a. Initialize a 2D array costList(N, N). Since in Java it's N rows, each of N elements.\n\n   b. For each i from 1 to N (Fortran is 1-based?), but in Java it's 0-based. Wait, in Java, the loops are from 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to adjust indices to 1-based.\n\n   Wait, in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. So need to be careful with indices.\n\n   Let me think: in Java, for the first loop:\n\n   for (long i = 0; i < N; i++) { srimeList.add(scan.nextLong()); }\n\n   So srimeList is 0-based. In Fortran, we can have an array of size N, with indices 1 to N. So when translating, the first element (Java's 0) is Fortran's 1.\n\n   So for the costList in Java is N rows (0-based) each with N elements (0-based). So in Fortran, we can have a 2D array of size (N, N), with indices 1 to N for rows and columns.\n\n   So for each i from 1 to N (Java's i from 0 to N-1):\n\n   costList[i][0] = srimeList[i]\n\n   Wait, in Java, costList.get(i)[0] = srimeList.get(i). So in Fortran, costList(i, 1) = srimeList(i) (since Java's 0 is Fortran's 1).\n\n   Then, for castNum from 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum starts at 1 up to N-1):\n\n   For each i, costList[i][castNum] = min( costList[i][castNum-1], srimeList[ (i - castNum + N) % N ] )\n\n   Wait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran terms, for the (i - castNum + N) % N part:\n\n   Let me see: in Java, the current i is from 0 to N-1. The term (i - castNum + N) % N gives an index between 0 and N-1. So in Fortran, the equivalent would be ( (i-1 - castNum + N) mod N ) + 1 ?\n\n   Because in Fortran, the indices start at 1. So for example, Java's i=0 would be Fortran's 1. So to convert Java's index to Fortran's, add 1. So the Java's (i - castNum + N) % N would be ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ), which gives 0-based. To get the Fortran index, add 1.\n\n   So the expression becomes:\n\n   ( ( (i-1) - castNum + N ) mod N ) + 1\n\n   Wait, let me think again. Let's say in Java, the index is (i - castNum + N) % N. Let's call that javaIndex. Then in Fortran, the index is javaIndex + 1.\n\n   So in Fortran, the equivalent is:\n\n   ( ( (i-1) - castNum + N ) mod N ) + 1\n\n   So for each i in 1..N, and castNum from 1 to N-1 (since in Java castNum goes up to N-1):\n\n   costList(i, castNum) = min( costList(i, castNum-1), srimeList( ( (i-1 - castNum + N) mod N ) + 1 ) )\n\n   Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe better to use 1-based indices throughout.\n\n   Once the costList is filled, then for each i from 1 to N (Java's i from 0 to N-1):\n\n   The sum is the sum over all rows' j-th column, where j is i (since in Java, j = i, so in Fortran, j = i). Wait, in Java, for each i, the j is set to i (the current i). Then, the sum is over all costArray[j], where costArray is each row's array. So for each row in costList, take the j-th element (j = i), sum all those.\n\n   So in Fortran, the sum is sum over k=1 to N of costList(k, i). Because for each row k (Java's j), the column is i (Java's j is the current i, so in Fortran, the column is i).\n\n   So the total for each i is (i-1)*x + sum(costList(1:N, i)), since in Java, i is 0-based, so (i)*x. In Fortran, i is 1-based, so (i-1)*x.\n\n   Then, the minimum of all these values is the first step's output.\n\n3. The second step's input is the string representation of min_val. So in Fortran, we need to convert min_val to a string. Then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\n   The second program's processing:\n\n   The input is a string x. Create two copies a and b. For a, iterate from the second character to the end. If current character equals previous, flip it (0 to 1 or 1 to 0), count a1. For b, iterate from the end backward, and if previous character (i-1) is same as current, flip the previous character and count a2. The minimum of a1 and a2 is the output.\n\n   So in Fortran, the string is a character array. We can process it as follows:\n\n   - Convert the min_val (integer) to a string. Let's say the string is s.\n\n   - For a's processing:\n\n     Initialize a as s. Then loop from 2 to len_trim(s):\n\n     if a(i) == a(i-1), then flip it, increment a1.\n\n   - For b's processing:\n\n     Initialize b as s. Then loop from len_trim(s) down to 2:\n\n     if b(i-1) == b(i), then flip b(i-1), increment a2.\n\n   Then output min(a1, a2).\n\n   So in Fortran, the string can be handled as a character array. Need to be careful with Fortran's string handling (fixed length, etc.), but perhaps using a character array of sufficient length.\n\n4. The third step's input is the integer result from the second step. So convert that integer to a long (Fortran's integer(8)), then process as per the third Java program.\n\n   The third program's logic:\n\n   The input is a number (number). The code looks for the smallest number made of 4 and 7 with equal counts, and >= number.\n\n   The approach is to generate numbers by converting binary masks (starting from 2) to binary strings, then check if the number of 0s and 1s are equal (excluding the first character?), then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and track the first such value >= input.\n\n   So in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n   - Read the input (from the second step's output, which is an integer, so cast to integer(8)).\n\n   - Initialize variables: ans = -1, value = 0, mask starts at 2.\n\n   - Loop while value < number:\n\n     a. Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting at position 2 (since in Java substring(1) is from index 1, which is the second character in 0-based).\n\n     b. Check if the number of '0's equals the number of '1's in the substring.\n\n     c. If yes, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse to value.\n\n     d. Increment mask.\n\n   - Once the loop exits, output the value.\n\n   Wait, but in the Java code, the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. The first value found that is >= number is the one to output. So the loop stops when value >= number, and then the value is printed. So in Fortran, the loop should continue until value >= number, but the code's loop is while (value < number). So the loop runs until value is no longer less than number. So the first time value is >=, the loop stops, and the value is the answer.\n\n   So in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\n   do while (value < number)\n\n      ... compute s, check conditions, compute value ...\n\n   end do\n\n   then print value.\n\n   Now, the steps for converting mask to binary string:\n\n   In Fortran, to get the binary string of an integer, we can use the intrinsic function. For example, using the edit descriptor in write statements. Alternatively, we can write a function to convert an integer to a binary string.\n\n   Let's think of mask as an integer. The binary string can be obtained by writing the number in base 2. For example, using a character array.\n\n   The code in Java uses Integer.toBinaryString(mask). So in Fortran, for a given mask (integer), we can generate the binary string as follows:\n\n   function int_to_bin(n) result(bin_str)\n      integer, intent(in) :: n\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n      integer :: i, len\n      bin_str = ''\n      if (n == 0) then\n          bin_str = '0'\n          return\n      end if\n      do while (n > 0)\n          bin_str = trim(adjustl(achar(mod(n,2)+48))) // bin_str\n          n = n / 2\n      end do\n   end function\n\n   But this is a rough idea. Alternatively, using write statements into a character variable.\n\n   Alternatively, using the Fortran intrinsic function:\n\n   write (unit, fmt='(B)') mask\n\n   But the exact method may vary. Let's assume we can write a function to get the binary string.\n\n   Once the binary string is obtained, we take the substring starting from the second character (since in Java it's substring(1), which is from index 1, so the second character in 1-based).\n\n   Then, count the number of '0's. If the count equals the number of '1's (i.e., total length is even, and count0 = length/2), then proceed.\n\n   Then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, then parse to a long (integer(8)).\n\n   So in Fortran, after generating the substring s (without the first character), we can process it.\n\n   Now, putting all together in Fortran:\n\n   The program will have:\n\n   - Read N, x, and the list of N numbers (srimeList).\n\n   - Compute the first step's min_val.\n\n   - Convert min_val to a string s1.\n\n   - Process s1 through the second step to get an integer result2.\n\n   - Convert result2 to a long (integer(8)) as the input for the third step.\n\n   - Process through the third step to get the final result.\n\n   - Output the final result.\n\n   Now, let's start coding.\n\n   First, the first step's code.\n\n   Let's outline variables:\n\n   In Fortran:\n\n   integer :: N, x\n   integer(8) :: srimeList(N)\n   integer(8) :: costList(N, N)\n   integer(8) :: min_val\n\n   Then, read N, x, then read N numbers into srimeList.\n\n   Then, initialize costList:\n\n   do i = 1, N\n      costList(i, 1) = srimeList(i)\n   end do\n\n   Then, for castNum from 2 to N (since in Java castNum starts at 1 up to N-1, but in Fortran, castNum would be 2 to N? Wait, let's see:\n\n   In Java, for castNum in 1 to N-1 (since castNum < N). So in Fortran, castNum runs from 1 to N-1 (since in Java castNum starts at 1). Wait, no, in Java, the loop is for (castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++). So castNum goes from 1 to N-1. So in Fortran, castNum would be from 1 to N-1.\n\n   So for each castNum in 1 to N-1:\n\n      do i = 1, N\n          prev = costList(i, castNum)\n          prev_val = costList(i, castNum)\n          Wait, no. Wait, in Java:\n\n          costList.get(i)[castNum] = Math.min( costList.get(i)[castNum-1], ... )\n\n          So in Fortran, for each i and castNum:\n\n          costList(i, castNum+1) = min( costList(i, castNum), ... )\n\n          Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the loop is for castNum from 1 to N-1 (since castNum < N). For each castNum, the current column is castNum (since in Java, the columns are 0-based). So in Fortran, the columns are 1-based. So for castNum in 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum is 1-based here?), the current column is castNum+1? Wait, perhaps I need to reindex.\n\n          Let me think again:\n\n          In Java, for each i (row), the costList[i][0] is set first. Then for castNum from 1 to N-1 (since castNum < N), the costList[i][castNum] is computed as the min between costList[i][castNum-1] and the other term.\n\n          So in Fortran, the columns are 1-based. So for castNum in 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum is 1-based here?), the current column is castNum+1? No, no. Let me see:\n\n          The first column (Java's 0) is column 1 in Fortran. The next columns (Java's 1 to N-1) are columns 2 to N in Fortran. So for castNum in 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum from 1 to N-1), the Fortran column is castNum +1? No, no. Wait, in Java, castNum starts at 1, so the column is castNum (since the first column is 0). So in Fortran, the column is castNum +1? No, because Java's column 0 is Fortran's 1. So Java's castNum (starting at 1) corresponds to Fortran's column castNum +1? No, no. Let me think:\n\n          For example, when castNum is 1 in Java, the column is 1 (since castNum is 1). In Fortran, that's column 2 (since Java's 0 is 1, 1 is 2). So the Fortran column for castNum is castNum +1? No, no. Wait, the Java column index is castNum, so in Fortran, it's castNum +1? No, because Java's columns are 0-based. So for castNum in Java (starting at 1), the column is castNum. So in Fortran, the column is castNum +1? No, because Java's 0 is Fortran's 1. So Java's castNum (1) is column 1 in Java, which is column 2 in Fortran. So the Fortran column is castNum +1? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\n          Java's column indices are 0 to N-1. So for castNum in 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum), the column is castNum. So in Fortran, the column is castNum +1 (since 0 becomes 1, so 1 becomes 2, etc.). So yes, the Fortran column is castNum +1? Wait, no. Wait, if castNum is 1 in Java, then the column is 1 (Java's index), which is 2 in Fortran. So the Fortran column is castNum +1. So for each castNum in 1 to N-1 (Java's castNum from 1 to N-1), the Fortran column is castNum +1? Wait, no, because the first column (Java's 0) is Fortran's 1. So Java's castNum (1) is column 1, which is Fortran's 2. So the Fortran column is castNum +1? Yes.\n\n          Wait, but in the first step, for castNum starting at 1 (Java's castNum=1), the column in Fortran is 2. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\n          do castNum = 1, N-1\n\n              column = castNum +1\n\n              previous_column = castNum\n\n              ... compute costList(i, column) = min( costList(i, previous_column), ... )\n\n          end do\n\n          So for each i and castNum from 1 to N-1:\n\n              costList(i, castNum+1) = min( costList(i, castNum), ... )\n\n          The other term is srimeList[ (i - castNum + N) % N ]\n\n          Wait, in Java, the term is srimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N )\n\n          Here, i is the row index (Java's i from 0 to N-1). So in Fortran, the row is i+1 (since Fortran's rows are 1-based). So the Java's i is (row-1). So the expression (i - castNum + N) mod N becomes:\n\n          ( (row-1) - castNum + N ) mod N \n\n          Then, the index in Java is that value, so in Fortran, it's (result +1).\n\n          So the Fortran index is ( ( (row-1) - castNum + N ) mod N ) +1 \n\n          So putting it all together:\n\n          do castNum = 1, N-1\n              do i = 1, N\n                  previous_val = costList(i, castNum)\n                  temp_index = ( (i-1) - castNum + N ) mod N\n                  temp_index = temp_index +1\n                  other_val = srimeList(temp_index)\n                  costList(i, castNum+1) = min( previous_val, other_val )\n              end do\n          end do\n\n          Wait, but in Java, the term is srimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N ), where i is the row index (Java's i). So in Fortran, the row is i (Fortran's row is i), so Java's i is (i-1). So the expression is ( (i-1) - castNum + N ) mod N. Then, the index in srimeList is that value (Java's index), so in Fortran it's (value +1).\n\n          So yes, the code above is correct.\n\n          Once the costList is filled, then compute for each i from 1 to N:\n\n              total = (i-1)*x + sum( costList(1:N, i) )\n\n          Then find the minimum of these totals.\n\n          So:\n\n          min_val = huge(1_8)\n          do i = 1, N\n              current_total = (i-1)*x + sum( costList(:, i) )\n              if (current_total < min_val) then\n                  min_val = current_total\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          So that's the first step.\n\n          Now, the second step's input is the string representation of min_val. So in Fortran, we need to convert min_val to a string. Let's say s1 is the string.\n\n          To convert an integer to a string in Fortran, we can use write statements:\n\n          character(len=20) :: s1\n          write(s1, '(I0)') min_val\n          s1 = adjustl(s1)\n\n          Then, process s1 through the second step's logic.\n\n          The second step's processing:\n\n          The string is s1. We need to process it as per the second Java program.\n\n          Let's create two character arrays a and b, each of length len_trim(s1).\n\n          integer :: len_s = len_trim(s1)\n          character(len=len_s) :: a, b\n          a = s1\n          b = s1\n\n          a1 = 0\n          a2 = 0\n\n          ! Process a:\n          do i = 2, len_s\n              if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n                  if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n                      a(i:i) = '0'\n                  else\n                      a(i:i) = '1'\n                  end if\n                  a1 = a1 +1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Process b:\n          do i = len_s, 2, -1\n              if (b(i-1:i-1) == b(i:i)) then\n                  if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                      b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n                  else\n                      b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n                  end if\n                  a2 = a2 +1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          result2 = min(a1, a2)\n\n          So that's the second step's result.\n\n          Now, the third step's input is result2 (an integer). We need to process it as per the third Java program.\n\n          The third step's input is a number (number) which is result2. But in the third Java program, the input is a long, so in Fortran, we can cast it to integer(8).\n\n          So:\n\n          integer(8) :: number = int(result2, 8)\n\n          Now, the third step's processing:\n\n          We need to find the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 with equal counts, and >= number.\n\n          The approach is to loop mask starting from 2, compute the binary string, then process as per the code.\n\n          Let's outline variables:\n\n          integer :: mask = 2\n          integer(8) :: value = 0\n          character(len=20) :: bin_str, s\n\n          do while (value < number)\n              ! Convert mask to binary string\n              write(bin_str, '(B)') mask\n              ! Remove leading zeros? Or not? Wait, in Java's Integer.toBinaryString, it doesn't have leading zeros.

After loop, output value\n\n          However, there are a few issues here:\n\n          1. The binary string conversion in Fortran may include leading zeros or other characters. The write statement with '(B)' may not give the correct format. For example, the default may be to write leading zeros or have a different format.\n\n          2. The substring(2:) in Fortran may not work as expected if the binary string has leading zeros or other characters.\n\n          To handle the binary conversion properly, perhaps we need a helper function to get the binary string without leading zeros.\n\n          Let's write a function to convert an integer to its binary string without leading zeros:\n\n          function int_to_bin(n) result(bin_str)\n              integer, intent(in) :: n\n              character(len=:), allocatable :: bin_str\n              integer :: i, len\n              bin_str = ''\n              if (n == 0) then\n                  bin_str = '0'\n                  return\n              end if\n              do while (n > 0)\n                  bin_str = trim(achar(mod(n,2)+48)) // bin_str\n                  n = n / 2\n              end do\n          end function\n\n          Then, in the loop:\n\n          bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n          s = bin_str(2:)\n\n          Wait, but the original Java code uses substring(1), which is from index 1 (0-based in Java?), so in the binary string, the first character is removed. So in the function's result, the first character is the first bit (LSB?), but perhaps the function returns the binary string in the correct order.\n\n          Wait, the function appends the bits in reverse order. Let me see:\n\n          For example, if n is 2 (binary 10), then mod(2,2)=0, so first character is '0', then n becomes 1. mod(1,2)=1, so next character is '1', then n becomes 0. So bin_str is '0' // '1' \u2192 '10', which is correct. So the function returns the correct binary string without leading zeros.\n\n          So the function is correct.\n\n          So in the loop:\n\n          bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n          s = bin_str(2:)\n\n          Then, check zeros and ones.\n\n          Then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7.\n\n          Then parse to value.\n\n          So the loop would be:\n\n          mask = 2\n          value = 0\n          do while (value < number)\n              bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n              s = bin_str(2:)\n              zeros = 0\n              do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n                  if (s(i:i) == '0') zeros = zeros +1\n              end do\n              if (zeros /= len_trim(s) - zeros) then\n                  mask = mask +1\n                  cycle\n              end if\n              temp_s = s\n              do i = 1, len_trim(temp_s)\n                  if (temp_s(i:i) == '0') then\n                      temp_s(i:i) = '4'\n                  else\n                      temp_s(i:i) = '7'\n                  end if\n              end do\n              read(temp_s, '(I0)') value\n              mask = mask +1\n          end do\n\n          Once the loop exits, value is the desired output.\n\n          Now, putting all together in Fortran:\n\n          The program will have:\n\n          - Read N, x, and the list of N numbers.\n\n          - Compute first step's min_val.\n\n          - Convert min_val to string s1.\n\n          - Process s1 through second step to get result2.\n\n          - Convert result2 to integer(8) as number.\n\n          - Process through third step to get final value.\n\n          - Output final value.\n\n          Now, handling the first step's variables:\n\n          The first step requires a 2D array costList of size N x N. Since in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed sizes, but the input N is variable, we need to use allocatable arrays.\n\n          So the program will need to read N first, then allocate the arrays.\n\n          So the code outline:\n\n          program main\n              implicit none\n              integer :: N, x, i, j, castNum, temp_index, a1, a2, result2, len_s\n              integer(8) :: min_val, number, value\n              character(len=20) :: s1, a, b, bin_str, s, temp_s\n              integer(8), allocatable :: srimeList(:), costList(:,:)\n\n              !

Alternatively, we can use a fixed-length character variable, but that may be limiting. Alternatively, use a character(len=20) for bin_str in the function.\n\n          Alternatively, adjust the function to return a character(len=20):\n\n          function int_to_bin(n) result(bin_str)\n              integer, intent(in) :: n\n              character(len=20) :: bin_str\n              integer :: i, len\n              bin_str = ''\n              if (n == 0) then\n                  bin_str = '0'\n                  return\n              end if\n              do while (n > 0)\n                  bin_str = trim(achar(mod(n,2)+48)) // trim(bin_str)\n                  n = n / 2\n              end do\n          end function\n\n          But this may have leading spaces. To avoid that, perhaps use adjustl:\n\n          bin_str = adjustl(trim(achar(mod(n,2)+48)) // trim(bin_str))\n\n          Hmm, perhaps better to build it as a string and then trim it.\n\n          Alternatively, in the function:\n\n          bin_str = ''\n          if (n ==0) then\n              bin_str = '0'\n          else\n              do while (n >0)\n                  bin_str = achar(mod(n,2)+48) // bin_str\n                  n = n/2\n              end do\n          end if\n          bin_str = adjustl(bin_str)\n\n          So the function returns the trimmed string.\n\n          Also, in the code where bin_str is assigned, we can use:\n\n          bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n          Then, s = bin_str(2:)\n\n          But need to ensure that bin_str is long enough. Since mask can be up to whatever, but in practice, the loop will eventually find a suitable value.\n\n          Now, putting all together with the necessary declarations.\n\n          Also, in the first step's costList initialization:\n\n          The line:\n\n          temp_index = mod( (i-1 - castNum + N), N )\n\n          The mod function in Fortran returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. Since N is positive, mod(a, N) will give a value between 0 and N-1. So adding 1 gives the correct Fortran index.\n\n          Also, in the first step's loop for castNum, the loop is from 1 to N-1.\n\n          Now, testing for possible errors:\n\n          For example, when N=1, the loops may have issues. But the code should handle it.\n\n          Also, in the second step's processing, the string length must be at least 1. But since the first program's output is a number, which is at least 0, so the string is non-empty.\n\n          Now, the final Fortran program should look like this."
