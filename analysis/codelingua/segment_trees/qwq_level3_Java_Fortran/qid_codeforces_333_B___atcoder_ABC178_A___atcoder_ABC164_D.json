    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a result. The second takes that result as input, processes, and outputs again. The third does the same, and finally, the third's output is the final result.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each Java program's input and output. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Java file (codeforces_333_B.java):\n\nThis program reads two integers n and m. Then, for m lines, it reads pairs of integers (r, c). It tracks which rows and columns (between 2 and n-1) are banned. The answer is calculated as (n-2)*2 minus the counts of banned rows and columns. If n is odd, it checks if the middle row and column are both not banned, then subtracts 1 more.\n\nThe output is the computed answer.\n\nSecond file (atcoder_ABC178_A.java):\n\nThis takes an integer x. It checks if x is 1, then outputs 0 if it's 1, else 1. Wait, no, looking at the code: the code says:\n\nbool is true if x is 1. Then result is 1 if !bool (so x !=1) else 0. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false; \u2192 so bool is true when x is 1.\n\nThen result = !bool ? 1 : 0 \u2192 so if !bool is true (x is not 1), then result is 1. Else (x is 1), result is 0. So the output is 0 when x is 1, else 1. So the second program inverts the input (if input is 1 \u2192 0, else 1).\n\nThird file (atcoder_ABC164_D.java):\n\nThis takes a string S, and calculates the number of pairs of substrings (non-overlapping?) that form numbers divisible by 2019. The algorithm uses some modular arithmetic. The output is the count of such pairs.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit more involved. Let me see:\n\nThe code processes the string S from the end, calculating mod values for each position. The mod array holds the mod 2019 of the number formed from the suffix up to that position. The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs. The answer is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2), which counts the number of pairs with the same mod. Then, they add 1 to mod_cnt[0] before calculating, which might account for the empty string or something? Wait, the code does mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop. Hmm, perhaps the initial 0 mod is considered as well. The exact details might not be crucial for the translation, but the key is that the third program takes a string and outputs a number.\n\nNow, the sequence is:\n\nJava1's input \u2192 Java2's input \u2192 Java3's input \u2192 final output.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number (the answer). The second program takes that number as input (x), and outputs 0 or 1. The third program then takes that 0 or 1 as input? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the second program's output is an integer (0 or 1), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string S as input. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects an integer x, which is read via next(). So the first program's output is a number, which is read as x in the second program. The second program outputs 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string S, which is read via next(). So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a single integer (0 or 1). So the third program would read that as a string, like \"0\" or \"1\", and process it as a string. The third program's code is expecting a string, so that's okay.\n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first's output is a number (let's say A).\n\nSecond program takes A as input (x), outputs 0 or 1 (B).\n\nThird program takes B as input (as a string S), processes it, and outputs the count (C).\n\nThe final Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result C.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and m, then m pairs of r and c).\n\n2. Compute the first program's answer (A).\n\n3. Use A as input to the second program's logic (compute B = 0 if A is 1, else 1).\n\n4. Use B as input to the third program's logic (treat B as a string, e.g., \"0\" or \"1\", then compute the count as per the third Java program's algorithm).\n\n5. Output the final result from the third program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nVariables:\n\nn and m are integers.\n\nbannedRows and bannedCols are sets of integers. In Fortran, perhaps we can represent them as arrays or logical arrays. Since the banned rows and columns are those between 2 and n-1 (since r>1 and r <n, same for c). So for each of the m pairs, we check if r is between 2 and n-1 (exclusive?), then add to bannedRows. Similarly for c.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nif (r > 1 && r < n) \u2192 so r must be strictly between 1 and n. So for example, if n is 3, then r can be 2. So banned rows are those rows that are not on the edge (since 1 and n are edges). So the banned rows are those in 2..n-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can have an array of logicals for rows and columns. Let's say:\n\nmax_n is the maximum possible n? Well, since in Java, the code uses a HashSet, which can grow dynamically. But in Fortran, we need to decide the size. Since the problem's constraints aren't given, but in codeforces problems, n can be up to 1e5 or something, but perhaps in this problem, n is up to some limit. However, since the code uses a set, perhaps in Fortran, we can use an array of logicals for each possible row and column. Since the banned rows are between 2 and n-1, the maximum possible n is not known, but in the first program, n is read as input. So for the first part, we can have an array of size n, but since n can be up to, say, 1e5, but in Fortran, we can use a dynamic array? Wait, no, Fortran is static unless using allocatable arrays.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first program's n is up to some reasonable limit. Let's see the code's logic. The answer is (n-2)*2 minus the counts of banned rows and columns. The banned rows are those in 2..n-1 that were input. So the maximum possible n is not specified, but in codeforces problems, maybe n can be up to 1e5. But in Fortran, we can use an array of size, say, 1e5+1 (since rows can be up to n, which could be up to 1e5). Alternatively, since the banned rows are only those between 2 and n-1, perhaps we can have an array of size n, but since n is read first, we can allocate arrays based on n.\n\nWait, in Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays. So first, read n and m, then allocate arrays for banned rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for m times, read r and c. For each r and c, check if r is between 2 and n-1 (exclusive?), then mark it as banned. Same for c.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can have two logical arrays, banned_rows and banned_cols, of size n. Initialize all to .false., then for each r and c, if r is between 2 and n-1, set banned_rows(r) = .true. Similarly for c.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses a hash set, so the same r can be added multiple times but only counted once. So in Fortran, the array approach works because even if the same r is added multiple times, the array will just be set to true once. So that's okay.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nInitialize banned_rows(1:n) = .false.\n\nSame for banned_cols.\n\nThen loop m times:\n\nRead r and c.\n\nif (r >1 .and. r <n) then\n\n   banned_rows(r) = .true.\n\nend if\n\nSimilarly for c.\n\nThen compute the answer:\n\nanswer = (n-2)*2\n\nanswer = answer - count(banned_rows(2:n-1)) \u2192 because banned_rows includes only those between 2 and n-1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the count of banned_rows where the index is between 2 and n-1 and the value is true.\n\nWait, the banned_rows array is size n, so indices 1 to n. So the banned rows are those in 2 to n-1 where banned_rows(r) is true. So the count is sum(banned_rows(2:n-1)).\n\nSame for columns.\n\nSo:\n\nanswer = (n-2)*2\n\nanswer = answer - count(banned_rows(2:n-1))\n\nanswer = answer - count(banned_cols(2:n-1))\n\nThen, check if n is odd. If so, mid = (n+1)/2. Check if mid is not in banned_rows and not in banned_cols. If so, subtract 1.\n\nSo:\n\nif mod(n,2) /=0 then\n\n   mid = (n+1)/2\n\n   if (.not. banned_rows(mid) .and. .not. banned_cols(mid)) then\n\n      answer = answer -1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nThen, the first program's output is answer.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program takes the first's output (answer) as x, then outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing answer, we set x = answer. Then compute result_second = 0 if x ==1 else 1.\n\nThird part: the third program takes the result_second (0 or 1) as input, which is a string. So the input to the third program is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nThe third program's code processes the string S, which is the input. Let's see the code:\n\nThe third program reads S as a string (using next(), which is the first token, so the entire input line if it's just a single number). Then, it calculates the number of substrings (non-overlapping?) that form numbers divisible by 2019. The algorithm uses modular arithmetic.\n\nThe code's logic is as follows:\n\nInitialize mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays. The mod_arr is of length N (the length of S). mod_cnt is of size 2019 (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018).\n\nThe loop goes from 0 to N-1 (assuming 0-based). The code processes the string from the end (since it's N-1 -i). Let me see:\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n    if (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) %2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix *10 %2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to N-1. The character is at position N-1 -i. So when i=0, it's the last character (since N-1 -0 = N-1). Then i=1 is N-2, etc. So the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nThe variable 'radix' starts at 1. For each step, the current digit is multiplied by the current radix (which is 10^i mod 2019?), then added to previous mod values.\n\nWait, the algorithm is calculating the mod 2019 of the number formed by the substring ending at position (original string's) position (N-1 -i). The way it's done is using a sliding window approach with modular arithmetic.\n\nThe key idea is that for each position, the mod value is computed, and the mod array holds the mod of the number formed from the suffix up to that position. The mod_cnt counts how many times each mod value occurs. The answer is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], which implies that the substring between them is divisible by 2019.\n\nThe code then adds mod_cnt[0] by 1 before calculating the answer. Wait, the code does mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop. Then, the answer is sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). The +1 to mod_cnt[0] might be accounting for the empty string or the initial 0 mod.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized to all zeros. Then, during the loop, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. After the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. Then, the sum is over all mod values of (count * (count-1)/2).\n\nThe reason for adding 1 to mod_cnt[0] is probably because the empty substring (or the case where the substring starts at the beginning) is considered. Alternatively, perhaps the initial 0 mod is part of the count. Let me think:\n\nThe algorithm is counting the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j]. The mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the number formed from the substring S[N-1 -i ... N-1], but perhaps the way it's computed allows for the difference between mod_arr[j] and mod_arr[i] to be divisible by 2019 when multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. The exact math might be a bit involved, but the code's approach is standard for this type of problem.\n\nIn any case, the third program's input is the string S (either \"0\" or \"1\"), and the output is the count of such pairs.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third part's input is the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nLet me see what the third program would output for each case.\n\nCase 1: S is \"0\".\n\nThe length N is 1.\n\nmod_arr has size 1.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 0:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigit = S[0] (since in Fortran, strings are 1-based?), but in Java, S is \"0\", so the first character is '0'.\n\nWait, in the code, S is read via next(), which is the first token. So if the input is \"0\", then S is \"0\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nN = 1.\n\nmod_arr has size 1.\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\ni=0:\n\ndigit = S.charAt(N-1 -0) \u2192 S.charAt(0) (since N-1 is 0). The digit is 0.\n\ntmp = (0) * 1 mod 2019 \u2192 0.\n\nSince i is 0, no addition. mod_arr[0] =0.\n\nmod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10 mod 2019 \u2192 10.\n\nAfter loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented to 2.\n\nThen ans is sum over all mod values of (count * (count-1)/2).\n\nFor mod 0: 2*(1)/2 =1. All other mods are 0. So total ans is 1.\n\nSo the output is 1.\n\nCase 2: S is \"1\".\n\nSame steps:\n\ndigit is 1.\n\ntmp =1 *1 mod2019 \u21921.\n\nmod_arr[0] =1.\n\nmod_cnt[1] is 1.\n\nmod_cnt[0] is 0 before the increment. After incrementing mod_cnt[0], it becomes 1 (since mod_cnt[0] was 0, adding 1 makes it 1).\n\nWait, no: after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is 0 (since the only mod was 1). Then mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 \u2192 becomes 1. So the sum would be for mod 0: 1*0/2 =0, mod1: 1*0/2=0. So total ans is 0.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is 0 (since the first mod was 1). Then mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 \u2192 becomes 1. mod_cnt[1] is 1.\n\nSo the sum is (1 choose 2) for mod0 (1*0/2=0) plus (1 choose 2 for mod1 \u21920). So total ans is 0.\n\nSo the third program's output is 1 if the input is \"0\", else 0.\n\nWait, but let me check again for S=\"0\":\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is 1 (from the first iteration). Then mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 \u2192 becomes 2. So the count for mod0 is 2, so 2*1/2 =1. So yes, the answer is 1.\n\nFor S=\"1\", the mod is 1, so mod_cnt[1] is 1. mod_cnt[0] is 0, then becomes 1. So mod0 has count 1, mod1 has 1. So the sum is (1 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) \u2192 0 +0 \u21920. So the output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the third program's output is 1 when the input is \"0\", else 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe entire sequence is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first's output (A) \u2192 second's input (x=A) \u2192 second's output (B = 0 if A=1 else 1) \u2192 third's input (S = str(B)) \u2192 third's output (C = 1 if B is 0, else 0).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the third program's output is 1 when the input is \"0\", else 0. So if B is 0 \u2192 third outputs 1. If B is 1 \u2192 third outputs 0.\n\nSo the final output C is 1 when B is 0, else 0.\n\nBut B is 0 when A is 1, else B is 1.\n\nSo:\n\nIf A is 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 C is 1.\n\nElse (A is not 1 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 C is 0.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nSuppose first program's output is A=5 \u2192 B is 0 (since 5 !=1 \u2192 B=0). Then third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output is 1.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the second program's output is B = 0 when A is 1, else 1. So:\n\nA=1 \u2192 B=0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output is 1.\n\nA=0 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third's input is \"1\" \u2192 output is 0.\n\nA=2 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third's input is \"1\" \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo the final output C is 1 only when A is 1, else 0.\n\nWait, that's an interesting simplification. Because the second and third programs together invert the first's output twice? Let me see:\n\nThe second program inverts A to B (B = 1 - (A ==1 ? 1 :0) \u2192 no, actually, the second program's code is:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 :0 \u2192 where bool is (A ==1). So:\n\nif A is 1 \u2192 bool is true \u2192 result is 0.\n\nif A is not 1 \u2192 bool is false \u2192 result is 1.\n\nThen the third program takes B (0 or 1) as a string and outputs 1 if B is 0, else 0.\n\nSo the third's output is 1 when B is 0 \u2192 which is when A is 1.\n\nElse, when B is 1 (A not 1), third outputs 0.\n\nSo the final output is 1 if A is 1, else 0.\n\nWait, so the entire sequence's final output is 1 if the first program's answer is 1, else 0.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification. So the entire chain's output is 1 if the first program's answer is exactly 1, else 0.\n\nBut that's only true because of the way the second and third programs are structured. So perhaps this can be optimized, but the problem requires to translate the sequence exactly, so we can't take shortcuts. We have to process each step as per the code.\n\nBut for the Fortran code, we need to compute each step step by step.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and m, then m pairs of r and c).\n\n2. Compute the first program's answer (A).\n\n3. Compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\n4. Compute the third program's result based on B (as a string \"0\" or \"1\").\n\n5. Output the third's result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read m pairs of r and c.\n\nCompute banned_rows and banned_cols arrays.\n\nCompute A as per first program's logic.\n\nThen compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nThen, process the string S which is the character corresponding to B (either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nThen compute the third program's answer based on S.\n\nFinally, output that answer.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nWe need to read n and m. Then m pairs of integers.\n\nWe can use an allocatable array for banned_rows and banned_cols. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with a size. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5, but we can read n first, then allocate arrays of size n.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, r, c, answer, B, mid, ans_third\n\nlogical, allocatable :: banned_rows(:), banned_cols(:)\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: S\n\n!

For i=0: N-1 -i =1 \u2192 S[1] (the second character in 0-based, which is '1' in \"01\").\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's take S as \"01\" (Java's S is \"01\").\n\nJava's N is 2.\n\nFor i=0:\n\nposition is N-1 -i \u2192 1 -0 =1 \u2192 S[1] is '1' (since 0-based).\n\ni=1 \u2192 N-1 -1 =0 \u2192 S[0] is '0'.\n\nSo the digits are processed in reverse order: first '1', then '0'.\n\nIn Fortran, for S = \"01\" (characters 1 and 2 are '0' and '1'):\n\nFor i_loop=1:\n\nN_S -i_loop +1 =2 \u2192 S(2) \u2192 '1'\n\ni_loop=2 \u2192 N_S -2 +1 =1 \u2192 S(1) \u2192 '0'\n\nSo the digits are processed in the same order as Java. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the mod_cnt(0) is incremented by 1 after the loop. In the code above, after the loop, mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0)+1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. So yes, that's done here.\n\nThe rest of the code for the third part should be okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's answer is 1 \u2192 B=0 \u2192 S is \"0\" \u2192 third's output is 1.\n\nSo the final output is 1.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nFirst program's answer is 0 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 S is \"1\" \u2192 third's output is 0.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nFirst program's answer is 2 \u2192 B=1 \u2192 third's output is 0.\n\nAnother test case where the third program's input is \"00\".\n\nWait, but in our case, the third program's input is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nSo the code should handle those cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran should be written as above.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and that the arrays are allocated.\n\nWait, in the third part, the mod_arr is allocated with size N_S. Since N_S is the length of S, which is 1 (since B is 0 or 1 \u2192 S is length 1). So mod_arr(1) is sufficient.\n\nAlso, mod_cnt is an array from 0 to 2018 (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018).\n\nThe code uses integer(8) for ans to handle large numbers, but in the third program's code, the answer can be up to (2019 choose 2) which is about 2e6, so integer(4) is sufficient. But to be safe, using integer(8) is okay.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should look like this."
