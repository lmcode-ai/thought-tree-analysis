    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_459_B) reads an integer N followed by N integers. It sorts them, finds the min and max, counts how many times each occurs. Then it calculates the difference between max and min, and the number of pairs. If all elements are the same, the pairs are combinations of the count, else it's the product of min and max counts. The output is two numbers: the difference and the pair count.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_581_A) takes two integers a and b. It counts how many times you can subtract 1 from both (as long as both are positive), then adds half of the remaining a and b (integer division). The output is the count plus the sum of those halves.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_171_A) takes two integers n and m. It reverses m (but if m is a single digit, it appends a zero, so like 5 becomes 50?), then adds that reversed number to n and outputs the result.\n\nWait, let me check the reverse function again. The reverse function in the third Java program: if n is less than 10, returns n *10. So for example, m=5, reverse returns 50. For m=12, it becomes 21. For m=100, it becomes 001? Wait no, the code does:\n\nIn reverse function, if n <10, return n*10. So for m=100, the code would process t = 100, r starts at 0. Then:\n\nLoop:\n\nt=100, r=0 \u2192 r=0*10 + 0 \u2192 0? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code for reverse is:\n\npublic static int reverse(int n) {\n    if (n < 10) return n * 10;\n    int t = n, r = 0;\n    while (t > 0) {\n        r = (r * 10) + t % 10;\n        t = t / 10;\n    }\n    return r;\n}\n\nWait, so for n=100:\n\nt starts as 100. The first condition (n <10?) is false, so proceed. Then in the loop:\n\nt=100 \u2192 r = 0*10 + 100%10 \u2192 0 +0 \u2192 0. Then t becomes 10.\n\nNext iteration: t=10 \u2192 r = 0*10 +10%10 \u2192 0 +0 \u2192 0. Then t becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: t=1 \u2192 r =0*10 +1 \u2192 1. Then t becomes 0. Loop ends. So returns 1. So 100 reversed is 1. But the first condition is only for n <10. So for m=100, the reversed is 001 \u2192 but leading zeros are not considered, so it's 1. So the code's reverse function for 100 would return 1. But for m=5, it's 5*10=50. So that's correct.\n\nSo the third program takes n and m, reverses m (with that rule), adds to n, and outputs the sum.\n\nNow, the sequence is: first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is input to the third.\n\nWait, the first program outputs two numbers: the difference and the pair count. The second program takes two integers a and b as input, which would be those two numbers. Then the second program outputs two numbers again (count and ans). The third program takes two numbers n and m, which would be the two numbers from the second's output. Then the third reverses m and adds to n, outputting the result.\n\nSo the entire chain is:\n\nInput \u2192 first program \u2192 outputs two numbers \u2192 second program takes them as a and b \u2192 outputs two numbers \u2192 third program takes them as n and m \u2192 outputs the final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and the array A from input.\n\n2. Process first program's logic: sort the array, find min and max, count their occurrences, compute the two outputs (diff and pairs).\n\n3. Take those two numbers as a and b for the second program's processing.\n\n4. Process the second program's logic: count how many times you can decrement both a and b (as long as both >0), then compute the sum of a//2 + b//2, then output count + (a//2 + b//2). Wait, no, the second program's code is:\n\nIn the second Java program:\n\nThe code does:\n\ncount starts at 0. Then in a loop, while a and b are >0, subtract 1 each and increment count. So the loop runs until either a or b is 0. So the count is the minimum of a and b initially? Wait, no, because the loop runs as long as both are >0. So for example, if a=3, b=5, the loop runs 3 times (since after 3 steps, a becomes 0, so loop stops). So count is min(a,b). Then after the loop, the remaining a and b are (0, 2). Then ans is (0//2) + (2//2) \u2192 0 +1 =1. So total output is count (3) + ans (1) \u2192 3 1?\n\nWait, the code's output is \"count + \" + ans. Wait, no, the code's print statement is:\n\nSystem.out.println(count + \" \" + ans);\n\nSo the two numbers are count and ans. The ans is (a/2 + b/2). So after the loop, the remaining a and b are (a - count, b - count). So the ans is ( (a - count)/2 + (b - count)/2 ), but since count is the minimum of a and b, let's see:\n\nSuppose a=5, b=3 \u2192 count is 3. Then remaining a is 2, b is 0. So ans is 2/2 +0/2 \u21921+0=1. So the output is 3 1.\n\nSo the second program's output is two numbers: count and ans. So the third program takes those two numbers as n and m. Wait, the third program's input is two numbers n and m. So the first number from the second program's output is n, the second is m. Then the third program reverses m (with the reverse function) and adds to n, then outputs the sum.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (for the first program).\n\n- Compute the first program's output (two numbers).\n\n- Use those two numbers as inputs to the second program's processing, getting two numbers.\n\n- Use those two numbers as inputs to the third program's processing, getting the final result.\n\n- Output that final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and the array A.\n\n2. Sort the array (ascending).\n\n3. Find min (A(1) after sorting) and max (A(N)).\n\n4. Count the number of min (mins) and max (maxs).\n\n5. Compute the first output pair (diff, pairs):\n\n   diff = max - min\n\n   if min == max, then pairs = mins*(mins-1)/2\n\n   else pairs = mins * maxs\n\n6. Now, take these two numbers (diff and pairs) as a and b for the second step.\n\n7. Second step:\n\n   Initialize count =0\n\n   while a>0 and b>0:\n\n      count +=1\n\n      a -=1\n\n      b -=1\n\n   Then compute ans = (a//2) + (b//2)\n\n   So the second output is (count, ans)\n\n8. Take these two numbers (count and ans) as n and m for the third step.\n\n9. Third step:\n\n   reverse m (using the reverse function as per Java's code).\n\n   Then compute reversed_m + n \u2192 output that.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the sorting part. In Fortran, we can sort an array using the Mergesort or other methods. Since the array is small (since in Java it's handled with N up to maybe 1e5? Well, but in Fortran, we can use the built-in sort function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array can be sorted with the 'sort' intrinsic. So:\n\ncall sort(A)\n\nBut need to make sure it's in ascending order. The default is ascending, so that's okay.\n\nThen, finding min and max. Since the array is sorted, the first element is min, last is max.\n\nCounting the number of min and max:\n\nmins = count(A == min_val)\n\nmaxs = count(A == max_val)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the count function can be used with logical arrays. So yes.\n\nNow, the reverse function for the third step. The reverse function in Java for m is as follows:\n\nIf m is less than 10, then return m *10. Else, reverse the digits.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the reverse function, if n <10, return n*10. So for m=5, it becomes 50. For m=9, 90. For m=10, it's 01 \u2192 but the code reverses 10 as 01, but leading zeros are not considered, so 10 becomes 01 \u2192 but in code, the code would process 10 as:\n\nt =10, r=0.\n\nFirst iteration: r =0*10 +10%10 \u2192 0 +0 \u21920? Wait, 10 mod 10 is 0. So r becomes 0. Then t becomes 10/10 =1.\n\nSecond iteration: r =0*10 +1 mod10 \u21921 \u2192 r=1. t becomes 0. So returns 1. But since 10 is not less than 10, so the first condition is not met. So the reverse of 10 is 1. But according to the code's first condition, only when n is less than 10, multiply by 10. So for m=10, the reverse is 1. For m=5, it's 50. For m= 12 \u2192 21. For m= 100 \u21921. For m= 0 \u21920*10=0. Hmm, but m can be zero?\n\nWait, in the third Java program, m is an input, so it can be zero. So the reverse function for m=0 would return 0*10=0. But if m is 0, then the code would return 0*10=0. But when m is 0, the code's reverse function would first check if n (0) <10 \u2192 yes, so returns 0*10=0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the reverse function in Fortran needs to handle this.\n\nImplementing reverse in Fortran:\n\nFunction reverse(m) result(r)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: m\n\ninteger :: r, t, temp\n\nif (m <10) then\n\n   r = m *10\n\nelse\n\n   r =0\n\n   t = m\n\n   do while (t >0)\n\n      r = r *10 + mod(t,10)\n\n      t = t /10\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nend function reverse\n\nWait, but in the code, the reverse function for m=10 would return 1, which is correct. Let me test with m=10:\n\nElse block:\n\nr starts at 0.\n\nt=10:\n\nr =0*10 +10 mod10 \u21920 +0 \u21920. Then t becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nr =0*10 +1 mod10 \u21921 \u2192 r=1. t becomes 0. Loop ends. So returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test: m=5 \u2192 first condition applies, returns 50.\n\nm= 12 \u2192 else block: 12 \u2192 t=12 \u2192 r=0*10 +2 \u21922. t=1 \u2192 r=2*10 +1 \u219221. So returns 21. Correct.\n\nOkay, that function should work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\nRead N and the array A.\n\nSort A.\n\nCompute min and max.\n\nCount mins and maxs.\n\nCompute diff and pairs.\n\nThen process the second step with a = diff, b = pairs.\n\nThen process the second step's logic.\n\nThen take the count and ans (the two outputs from second step) as n and m for the third step.\n\nCompute reversed_m = reverse(m)\n\nsum = n + reversed_m\n\nPrint sum.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read N, then an array of N integers.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n\nRead N, then allocate A(N), then read the elements.\n\nThen sort A.\n\nThen min_val = A(1), max_val = A(N)\n\nCompute mins and maxs:\n\nmins = count(A == min_val)\n\nmaxs = count(A == max_val)\n\nCompute diff and pairs:\n\ndiff = max_val - min_val\n\nif (min_val == max_val) then\n\n   pairs = mins * (mins -1) /2\n\nelse\n\n   pairs = mins * maxs\n\nend if\n\nThen, the second step:\n\na = diff\n\nb = pairs\n\ncount =0\n\ndo while (a >0 .and. b>0)\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   a = a -1\n\n   b = b -1\n\nend do\n\nans = (a /2) + (b /2)\n\nSo the second step's outputs are count and ans.\n\nThen, third step:\n\nn = count\n\nm = ans\n\nreversed_m = reverse(m)\n\nresult = n + reversed_m\n\nprint *, result\n\nWait, but the third program's input is n and m, which are the two numbers from the second program's output. The third program takes n and m, reverses m, adds to n, outputs the sum.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nBut need to make sure that the reverse function is defined as a function.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, functions can be defined inside the program, but in some versions, you need to declare them.\n\nAlternatively, use a function inside a module, but perhaps for simplicity, just write the function inside the program.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90, you can have internal functions.\n\nAlternatively, here's the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:)\n\ninteger :: min_val, max_val, mins, maxs, diff, pairs\n\ninteger :: a, b, count, ans, n, m, reversed_m, result\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, N\n\nallocate(A(N))\n\nread*, A\n\n! Sort the array\n\ncall sort(A)\n\nmin_val = A(1)\n\nmax_val = A(N)\n\n! Count mins and maxs\n\nmins = count(A == min_val)\n\nmaxs = count(A == max_val)\n\n! Compute diff and pairs\n\ndiff = max_val - min_val\n\nif (min_val == max_val) then\n\n   pairs = mins * (mins -1) /2\n\nelse\n\n   pairs = mins * maxs\n\nend if\n\n! Second step: process a and b (diff and pairs)\n\na = diff\n\nb = pairs\n\ncount =0\n\ndo while (a >0 .and. b>0)\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   a = a -1\n\n   b = b -1\n\nend do\n\nans = (a /2) + (b /2)\n\n! Now, third step: n=count, m=ans\n\nn = count\n\nm = ans\n\n! Reverse m\n\nreversed_m = reverse(m)\n\nresult = n + reversed_m\n\nprint*, result\n\ncontains\n\ninteger function reverse(m)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: m\n\ninteger :: t, r\n\nif (m <10) then\n\n   reverse = m *10\n\nelse\n\n   r =0\n\n   t = m\n\n   do while (t >0)\n\n      r = r *10 + mod(t,10)\n\n      t = t /10\n\n   end do\n\n   reverse = r\n\nend if\n\nend function reverse\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second step, after the loop, a and b are the remaining values. So ans is (a//2) + (b//2). Since in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Java, the division is integer division (since a and b are integers). So in Fortran, using / is correct.\n\nTesting some cases.\n\nLet me test with an example.\n\nSuppose first program's input is N=3, A = [5,5,5].\n\nThen sorted A is [5,5,5]. min and max are 5. mins=3, maxs=3.\n\ndiff is 0. pairs is 3*2/2 =3.\n\nSecond step: a=0, b=3.\n\nThe loop condition a>0 and b>0 \u2192 since a is 0, loop doesn't run. count remains 0.\n\nans is (0/2)+(3/2) \u21920 +1 =1.\n\nSo second output is 0 1.\n\nThird step: n=0, m=1.\n\nreverse(m) is 1 (since m=1 <10 \u2192 1*10=10? Wait wait, wait m is 1 here. Wait m is 1, so the reverse function for m=1 would be 1*10=10?\n\nWait, in the third step, m is ans from the second step, which is 1. So m=1.\n\nSo reverse(1) \u2192 since m <10 \u2192 returns 1*10=10. So reversed_m is 10.\n\nThen result is 0 +10 =10. So the final output is 10.\n\nWait, but let's see what the original Java code would do.\n\nFirst program's output is 0 and 3 (since when all elements are same, the pair count is 3C2 =3). Wait wait, no, the first program's code when min == max, the pair count is mins*(mins-1)/2 \u2192 3*2/2=3. So the first program's output is \"0 3\".\n\nThen the second program takes a=0 and b=3.\n\nThe second program's loop runs while a and b are >0. Since a is 0, the loop doesn't run. count is 0.\n\nans is (0/2)+(3/2) \u21920 +1 =1. So the second program outputs \"0 1\".\n\nThird program takes n=0 and m=1. The reverse of m=1 is 10 (since m is less than 10 \u2192 1*10=10). So adding 0 +10 \u219210. So the final output is 10. Which matches the Fortran code's result.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nSuppose first program's input is N=2, A = [1,3].\n\nSorted A is [1,3]. min=1, max=3. mins=1, maxs=1.\n\ndiff is 2. pairs is 1*1=1.\n\nSecond step: a=2, b=1.\n\nLoop runs while a and b are >0. The minimum is 1. So count becomes 1. a becomes 1, b becomes 0.\n\nans is (1/2)+(0/2) \u21920 +0 =0. So second output is 1 0.\n\nThird step: n=1, m=0.\n\nreverse(m=0) \u2192 since 0 <10 \u21920*10=0. So reversed_m is 0. So result is 1+0=1. So output is 1.\n\nCheck with Java:\n\nFirst program outputs 2 1.\n\nSecond program takes a=2, b=1.\n\nLoop runs once (count=1, a becomes 1, b 0). Then ans is (1//2)+(0//2)=0+0=0. So output is 1 0.\n\nThird program takes n=1, m=0 \u2192 reverse(0) is 0 \u2192 1+0=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case for the third program's reverse function.\n\nSuppose m=12 \u2192 reversed is 21. So if in third step m is 12, then reversed is 21. So n +21.\n\nAnother example: m=5 \u2192 reversed is 50. So n +50.\n\nAnother example: m=100 \u2192 reversed is 1 (since 100 reversed via the code is 1). So n +1.\n\nWait, in the code for reverse(100):\n\nSince 100 >=10, so else clause.\n\nr starts at 0.\n\nt=100 \u2192 r =0*10 +0 \u21920. t becomes 10.\n\nNext iteration: r=0*10 +0 \u21920. t becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: r=0*10 +1 \u21921. t becomes 0. So returns 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if the second program's a and b are both zero?\n\nSuppose first program outputs 0 and 0 (if N=0? Wait, but N is given as input, probably N>=1. But if N=1, then all elements are same. So for N=1, A[0] =5. Then min and max are 5. mins=1, so pairs is 0 (1*0/2=0). So first program's output is 0 0.\n\nSecond program takes a=0, b=0 \u2192 loop doesn't run. count is 0. ans is (0/2)+(0/2)=0. So output is 0 0.\n\nThird program takes n=0, m=0 \u2192 reverse(0)=0 \u2192 sum 0+0=0.\n\nAnother case where m is a two-digit number like 25 \u2192 reversed is 52.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the sort function is available via the intrinsic. But in some older versions, you might need to use a different method, but assuming we can use the intrinsic.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the sort is in the intrinsic, but the array must be a rank-1 array. Since A is a 1D array, that's okay.\n\nAlso, the count function in Fortran counts the number of true elements in the logical array (A == min_val).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the final Fortran code."
