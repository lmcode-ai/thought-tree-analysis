    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and then figure out how to chain them in Fortran without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC153_A. It reads two integers h and a from input, then calculates how many times you subtract a from h until h becomes non-positive. The result is the number of subtractions, which is stored in 'num'. So the output of this first program is the value of 'num'.\n\nThe second program, codeforces_59_A, takes a word as input. It counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. Depending on which count is higher, it converts the entire word to uppercase or lowercase, or lowercase if they're equal. The output here is the transformed word.\n\nThe third program, atcoder_ARC062_B, reads a string S. It calculates a score based on comparing each character in S with a pattern: for even indices (0-based), it's 'g', odd indices 'p'. If the character doesn't match the expected, the score is adjusted. The output is the final score.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's output (num) is the input to the second program. But in the original setup, the second program's input is a word. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the first program's output is a number, but the second program expects a word. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output (the number) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a word (a string). That's a conflict. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking back at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is System.out.println(num); which is an integer. The second program's input is in.next(), which is a single token (word). So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a word. So the second program would process that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", so the word is \"5\", which has all lowercase letters, so it would output \"5\" again. Then the third program takes that output as input?\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string S. So the second program's output is the transformed word (like \"5\" in this case), which is then the input to the third program. The third program reads S as a string, processes it, and outputs the score.\n\nHmm, okay. So the sequence is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> num (integer) -> Program2 (treats num as a string) -> transformed string -> Program3 (processes that string) -> final score.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the initial input (the two integers h and a), compute num, then process that num as a string through the second step, then process the resulting string through the third step, and output the final score.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read h and a from input (first step's input).\n2. Compute num as in the first Java program.\n3. Take num as a string (since the second program's input is a word), process it to get the transformed string (all lowercase or uppercase, etc.).\n4. Take that transformed string and process it through the third step's logic to compute the score.\n5. Output the final score.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst step: Compute num.\n\nIn Java, the first program reads two integers h and a, then loops subtracting a from h until h <=0, counting the steps. The loop is a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nThe loop is for (int i = 1; h >0; i++) { h -=a; num++; }\n\nWait, but the loop condition is h>0. So each iteration subtracts a from h, and increments num. The loop runs as long as h is positive. So the number of steps is ceiling(h/a) if a divides h exactly, or ceiling(h/a) if not? Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose h=5, a=2. Then first iteration: h=5-2=3, num=1. Second: 3-2=1, num=2. Third: 1-2= -1, but the loop condition is h>0, so after subtracting, h is -1, so the loop stops. Wait, but the loop runs as long as h>0 before the iteration. Wait, the loop is for( ; h>0; i++). So the initial h is checked before each iteration. So in the example h=5, a=2:\n\nInitial h=5>0: enter loop. Subtract 2, h=3, num becomes 1. Then check again: h=3>0, so loop again. Subtract 2, h=1, num=2. Check again: h=1>0, loop again. Subtract 2, h=-1, num=3. Now check h>0? h is -1, so loop stops. So the total is 3 steps. So the formula is ceiling(h/a). Because 5/2 is 2.5, ceiling is 3.\n\nAlternatively, in code, the number of steps is (h +a -1)/a. Because integer division with ceiling.\n\nSo in Fortran, to compute num, we can do num = (h + a -1)/a. That would be more efficient than looping, but since the original code uses a loop, maybe we can do the same. But for code brevity, perhaps better to compute it directly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop starts with i=1, but the loop variable i isn't used except for the loop condition. The loop runs as long as h>0. So the loop is effectively h = h -a each time, and count the number of times. So the number of steps is the ceiling of h/a.\n\nSo in Fortran, to compute num, we can do:\n\nnum = (h + a -1) / a\n\nBut since in Fortran, integer division is done with /, which truncates towards zero. So (h +a -1)/a would give the ceiling.\n\nYes, that's correct. So that's the first step.\n\nSecond step: Take the num as a string, process it to determine uppercase vs lowercase.\n\nThe second Java program takes a word (the input is in.next(), which is a single token, so the first program's output is a number, which is a string here. So the input to the second program is the string representation of num. So in Fortran, we need to convert the integer num to a string, then process each character to count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nWait, but the number's string representation will only have digits, which are lowercase letters (since digits are not uppercase or lowercase). So in the second program, the word is a string of digits. So all characters are lowercase (since digits are considered lowercase?), so the lowercase count is the length of the string, uppercase is zero. Therefore, the transformed word would be the lowercase version, which is the same as the original. So the output of the second step is the same as the input (the string of the number). Wait, but let me confirm.\n\nIn Java, the code for the second program:\n\nThe word is the input (the first program's output is a number, so the input is a string like \"123\").\n\nEach character in the word is checked: if uppercase, increment uppercase, else lowercase.\n\nDigits are neither uppercase nor lowercase? Or are they considered lowercase?\n\nWait, in Java, Character.isUpperCase('0') is false, same for lowercase. So digits are neither. So in the code, for each character in the word, if it's uppercase, add to uppercase, else lowercase. So digits would be counted in lowercase? Because the else clause is for anything not uppercase, including lowercase letters and digits and symbols.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (Character.isUpperCase(ch)) uppercase++;\nelse lowercase++;\n\nSo digits, which are not uppercase, will be counted in lowercase. So for a string like \"123\", all characters are non-uppercase, so lowercase count is 3, uppercase 0. So the output is lowercase, so the word is printed as lowercase. Since the input is already all lowercase (digits are lowercase?), the output is the same as input. So the second program's output is the same as the input (the string of the number). Wait, but the input is a number, so the output is the same string. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. Hmm, so maybe the second program's processing here is redundant? But perhaps in some cases, if the first program's output had uppercase letters, but in this case, since it's a number, it's all digits, so the second program's output is the same as the input. So the second step's output is the same as the first's output. Interesting.\n\nBut regardless, in the Fortran code, I need to process the string representation of num through the second step's logic. So even if it's redundant, I have to do it.\n\nSo in Fortran, to get the string of num, we can use write to a string variable. For example, using an internal write statement.\n\nThen, process each character in that string to count uppercase and lowercase letters. Since the string is the number, all characters are digits, so uppercase count is 0, lowercase count is length of the string. So the result is to output the lowercase version, which is the same as the original string.\n\nThird step: Take the output of the second step (the string of the number) and process it through the third Java program's logic.\n\nThe third program reads a string S, then for each character in S, at position i (0-based), compares to 'g' if even index, 'p' if odd. If the character is different, adds 1 if my was 'p' (i.e., when the index is odd and my is 'p'), or subtracts 1 if my was 'g' (even index). Wait, let me recheck the code.\n\nThe third Java code's logic:\n\nfor each i from 0 to S.length-1:\n\nmy is 'g' if i%2 ==0 else 'p'\n\nhis is S.charAt(i)\n\nif my != his:\n\nscore += (if my is 'p' then 1 else -1)\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (my != his) {\n\nscore += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even index), and his is not 'g', then my is 'g', so the term is -1 added.\n\nWhen my is 'p' (odd index), and his is not 'p', then add 1.\n\nSo the score is calculated as follows:\n\nfor each position i:\n\nif i even:\n\nexpected 'g'\n\nif actual is not 'g', then subtract 1 (because my is 'g', so my != his, so add -1)\n\nif i odd:\n\nexpected 'p'\n\nif actual is not 'p', then add 1 (because my is 'p', so my != his, so add 1)\n\nSo the total score is sum over all characters:\n\nfor each character at position i:\n\nif (i even):\n\nif (char != 'g') then -1\n\nelse 0\n\nif (i odd):\n\nif (char != 'p') then +1\n\nelse 0\n\nSo the third step's input is the string from the second step, which is the string representation of the first program's output (num). So the third program's input is a string of digits (since num is a number). So each character in the string is a digit (0-9). So for each position, the expected character is 'g' or 'p' depending on the index. Since the actual character is a digit, which is different from 'g' or 'p', so each character contributes to the score.\n\nSo for each character in the string (digits):\n\nfor even indices (0,2,4...):\n\nexpected 'g', actual is a digit (not 'g'), so subtract 1.\n\nfor odd indices (1,3,5...):\n\nexpected 'p', actual is a digit (not 'p'), so add 1.\n\nSo the total score is:\n\nfor each even index: -1\n\nfor each odd index: +1\n\nSo the total is (number of odd indices) - (number of even indices).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the string has length N.\n\nThe number of even indices (starting at 0) is (N +1)/2 if N is odd, or N/2 if even.\n\nThe number of odd indices is N/2 if even, or (N-1)/2 if odd.\n\nWait, let's take an example:\n\nIf the string is \"123\" (length 3):\n\nIndices 0 (even) \u2192 contributes -1\n\nindex 1 (odd) \u2192 +1\n\nindex 2 (even) \u2192 -1\n\nTotal: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother example: \"1234\" (length 4):\n\nindices 0,1,2,3.\n\n0 even \u2192 -1\n\n1 odd \u2192 +1\n\n2 even \u2192 -1\n\n3 odd \u2192 +1 \u2192 total: (-1 +1) + (-1 +1) \u2192 0.\n\nHmm, so the total score is (number of odd indices) - (number of even indices).\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet the number of even indices be E, odd O.\n\nTotal score is (O *1) + (E *-1) \u2192 O - E.\n\nBut E and O depend on the length.\n\nFor length N:\n\nE = (N +1)/2 if N is odd, else N/2.\n\nO = N/2 if even, else (N-1)/2.\n\nSo E = ceiling(N/2), O = floor(N/2).\n\nWait, for N even:\n\nE = N/2, O = N/2 \u2192 O-E =0.\n\nFor N odd:\n\nE = (N+1)/2, O = (N-1)/2 \u2192 O-E = -1.\n\nSo the total score is (O - E) = ( (N-1)/2 - (N+1)/2 ) = (N-1 - N-1)/2 \u2192 -1.\n\nWait, for N odd, O-E is -1.\n\nWait, for N=3, O=1, E=2 \u2192 O-E = -1 \u2192 which matches the first example.\n\nSo the total score is (O - E) = ( (number of odd indices) - (number of even indices) )\n\nWhich is equal to ( (number of odd indices) - (number of even indices) )\n\nBut since the total indices are N = E + O,\n\nthen O - E = O - (N - O) = 2O - N.\n\nAlternatively, since O = (N - (N mod 2))/2, but perhaps it's easier to compute based on the length.\n\nAlternatively, the total score can be computed as (number of odd indices) - (number of even indices) = (O - E).\n\nBut since O = (N - E), then O - E = N - 2E.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the easiest way in code is to loop through each character in the string, and for each index, determine if it's even or odd, then add or subtract accordingly.\n\nIn Fortran, the string can be processed as a character array. Let's see.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read h and a from input.\n\n2. Compute num = (h + a -1)/a.\n\n3. Convert num to a string (e.g., using write statement).\n\n4. Process the string through the second step's logic (count uppercase and lowercase letters, then decide to uppercase or lowercase the entire string).\n\n5. Take the resulting string (from step 4) and process through the third step's logic to compute the score.\n\n6. Output the score.\n\nNow, let's code each part.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read h and a as integers.\n\nThen compute num.\n\nThen convert num to a string. Let's say the string is s_num.\n\nThen process s_num to get the transformed string (step 2's output).\n\nProcessing step 2:\n\nInitialize uppercase and lowercase counts to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in s_num:\n\nif the character is uppercase, increment uppercase.\n\nelse, increment lowercase.\n\nThen decide which to choose:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase \u2192 uppercase the string.\n\nelse \u2192 lowercase.\n\nBut since the input is a number, all characters are digits, which are lowercase (or neither, but in Java, digits are considered lowercase? Wait, in Java, the code counts digits as lowercase because they are not uppercase. So in Fortran, the same logic applies.\n\nIn Fortran, to check if a character is uppercase or lowercase, we can use the IACHAR function to get the ASCII code.\n\nFor a character c:\n\nif IACHAR(c) >= 65 and <=90 \u2192 uppercase.\n\nElse if between 97-122 \u2192 lowercase.\n\nElse (digits, etc.) \u2192 considered lowercase in the second step's logic (since in Java, the else clause includes them).\n\nWait, in the second Java program's code, the else clause is for anything not uppercase, so digits are counted in lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each character in s_num:\n\nif (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then uppercase +=1\n\nelse lowercase +=1\n\nSo digits (0-9) are in the else, so counted in lowercase.\n\nThus, for the string s_num (digits only), uppercase is 0, lowercase is length of s_num.\n\nThus, the transformed string is lowercase, which is the same as the original (since digits are already lowercase). So the transformed string is s_num.\n\nTherefore, the output of step 2 is s_num.\n\nThus, the third step's input is s_num.\n\nNow, processing step 3:\n\nThe third step's input is s_num (the string of the number).\n\nWe need to compute the score as per the third Java program.\n\nThe string S is s_num.\n\nLoop over each character in S (indices from 0 to len-1).\n\nFor each index i (0-based):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if i mod 2 ==0 else 'p'\n\nif S(i+1) (since Fortran is 1-based) is not equal to my_char, then:\n\nif my_char is 'p' (i is odd), add 1 to score.\n\nelse (my_char is 'g', i even), subtract 1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based, so the first character is at position 1. So for index i (0-based in Java), in Fortran it's i+1.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nIn the third program's code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < S.length(); i++) \u2192 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is stored as a character array with indices 1 to len.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to len-1 (Java's index), the Fortran index is i+1.\n\nThus, for each i in 0 to len-1:\n\nmy_char = 'g' if (i mod 2 ==0) else 'p'\n\ncurrent_char = S(i+1)\n\nif current_char /= my_char then:\n\nif my_char == 'p' \u2192 add 1\n\nelse \u2192 subtract 1\n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\nscore = 0\n\ndo i = 0, len_trim(S)-1\n\n   if (mod(i,2) ==0) then\n\n      my_char = 'g'\n\n   else\n\n      my_char = 'p'\n\n   end if\n\n   current_char = S(i+1:i+1)\n\n   if (current_char /= my_char) then\n\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n         score = score +1\n\n      else\n\n         score = score -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThus, the score is computed.\n\nPutting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read h and a.\n\n2. Compute num = (h +a -1)/a.\n\n3. Convert num to a string s_num.\n\n4. Process s_num through step 2's logic (but since it's digits, the transformed string is s_num).\n\n5. Process s_num through step 3's logic to get the score.\n\n6. Output the score.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: h, a, num, score\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_num\n\nThen, read h and a:\n\nread*, h, a\n\nCompute num:\n\nnum = (h + a -1)/a\n\nConvert num to string:\n\nwrite(s_num, '(i0)') num\n\nThen process step 2 (though it's redundant here, but code it properly):\n\ninteger :: uppercase, lowercase, len\n\nuppercase =0\n\nlowercase=0\n\nlen = len_trim(s_num)\n\ndo i=1, len\n\n   c = s_num(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   transformed = adjustl(uppercase(s_num))\n\nelse\n\n   transformed = adjustl(lower(s_num))\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting to uppercase or lowercase can be done with the intrinsic functions. However, Fortran's intrinsic functions for uppercase and lowercase are a bit limited. The functions are:\n\nTo uppercase: UPPERCASE(STRING)\n\nTo lowercase: LOWERCASE(STRING)\n\nWait, but in Fortran 90 and later, there are functions like 'achar' and 'ichar', but for case conversion, perhaps we can use the 'adjustl' and 'adjustr' but those are for trimming. Alternatively, we can use the 'uppercase' and 'lowercase' functions, but I think they are not standard. Wait, perhaps the best way is to loop through each character and convert them.\n\nAlternatively, since in our case, the transformed string is the same as the original (since all characters are lowercase or non-letters), we can skip this step. But to be precise, we need to code it properly.\n\nWait, the code for step 2 must be exactly as per the Java code. So even if the input is all lowercase, the code must process it.\n\nSo let's code it properly.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the uppercase function may not exist. So perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nTo convert to uppercase:\n\ntransformed = s_num\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_num)\n\n   c = s_num(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      transformed(i:i) = achar(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, since in our case, the transformed string is the same as the original (since all characters are digits, which are not uppercase), the code can be simplified, but to be accurate, we need to code the step properly.\n\nAlternatively, since the transformed string is s_num (since uppercase is 0, lowercase is len, so the code chooses lowercase, so transformed is s_num in lowercase, which is same as original), so the transformed string is s_num.\n\nThus, the transformed string is s_num.\n\nTherefore, the third step can use s_num directly.\n\nThus, the code can skip the step 2 processing, but to be precise, let's code it.\n\nWait, but in the code, the second step's output is the transformed string, which is the same as s_num. So the third step's input is s_num.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with s_num as the input to the third step.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter computing s_num, we can proceed to the third step.\n\nNow, the third step's processing:\n\nscore =0\n\nlen = len_trim(s_num)\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n   if (mod(i,2) ==0) then\n\n      my_char = 'g'\n\n   else\n\n      my_char = 'p'\n\n   end if\n\n   current_char = s_num(i+1:i+1)\n\n   if (current_char /= my_char) then\n\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n         score = score +1\n\n      else\n\n         score = score -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, print the score.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: h, a, num, score, i, len\n\n  character(len=20) :: s_num\n\n  !

Output the score\n\n  print*, score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So variables my_char and current_char need to be declared as character variables.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nAdd declarations:\n\ncharacter :: my_char, current_char\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: h, a, num, score, i, len\n\n  character(len=20) :: s_num\n\n  character :: my_char, current_char\n\n  !

Output the score\n\n  print*, score\n\nend program main\n\nThis should work.\n\nWait, but let's test with an example.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose h=5, a=2.\n\nnum = (5+2-1)/2 =6/2=3.\n\nThe string is \"3\".\n\nProcessing step 3:\n\nThe string is \"3\", length 1.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 0 (since len=1).\n\ni=0 (even):\n\nmy_char = 'g'\n\ncurrent_char is '3'.\n\n'3' is not 'g', so:\n\nsince my_char is 'g', subtract 1.\n\nscore becomes -1.\n\nThus, output is -1.\n\nWait, but according to the third program's logic, for the string \"3\":\n\nindex 0 (even) \u2192 expected 'g', actual '3' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1. So total score is -1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nh=4, a=2 \u2192 num= (4+2-1)/2 =5/2=2 (since integer division in Fortran truncates? Wait, (4+2-1)=5 \u2192 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 in Fortran, integer division gives 2. But according to the formula, it should be ceiling(4/2)=2. So correct.\n\nThe string is \"2\".\n\nProcessing step3:\n\nlength 1 \u2192 i=0 \u2192 'g' vs '2' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\nAnother test case where the string is longer.\n\nSuppose h=6, a=2 \u2192 num=3 \u2192 string \"3\" \u2192 same as before.\n\nAnother example: h=3, a=2 \u2192 num=(3+2-1)/2 =4/2=2 \u2192 string \"2\".\n\nSame as before.\n\nAnother example where the string is \"1234\".\n\nh= (1234's value) but let's pick h= 1234*a -1, so that num=1234.\n\nWait, let's pick h= 1234*2-1 =2467, a=2 \u2192 num=(2467+2-1)/2 =2468/2=1234 \u2192 string \"1234\".\n\nProcessing step3:\n\nlength 4.\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3.\n\ni=0 (even): my_char 'g' vs '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\ni=1 (odd): my_char 'p' vs '2' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1.\n\ni=2 (even): 'g' vs '3' \u2192 subtract 1.\n\ni=3 (odd): 'p' vs '4' \u2192 add 1.\n\nTotal: (-1 +1) + (-1 +1) \u2192 0.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example where length even gives 0.\n\nAnother test case with length 3: \"123\".\n\nIndices 0,1,2.\n\ni=0: 'g' vs '1' \u2192 -1.\n\ni=1: 'p' vs '2' \u2192 +1.\n\ni=2: 'g' vs '3' \u2192 -1.\n\nTotal: -1+1-1 = -1 \u2192 which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
