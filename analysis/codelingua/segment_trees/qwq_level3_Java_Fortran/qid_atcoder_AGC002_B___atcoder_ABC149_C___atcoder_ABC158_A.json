    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (AGC002_B) reads N and M, then processes M moves between boxes. The Box class has a moveTo method that transfers marbles. The final count of boxes with the red marble is printed. \n\nThe second file (ABC149_C) takes an integer x, finds the next prime number if x is even and not 2, then outputs it. Wait, actually, the code seems to check for primes but maybe it's looking for the next prime? Let me see. The code starts with x, if it's even and not 2, increments to next odd. Then loops checking if it's prime. If not, adds 2 and repeats. So it's finding the next prime after x, but maybe the first prime >=x? Hmm, need to make sure.\n\nThird file (ABC158_A) checks if a string contains both 'A' and 'B', outputs Yes or No.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read input once at the start, process all three steps without intermediate I/O, and output the final result. The outputs of each Java program are inputs to the next. Wait, but how do the outputs connect? Let me see the sequence:\n\nWait, the original sequence is Java1 -> Java2 -> Java3. So the output of Java1 is the input to Java2, and the output of Java2 is the input to Java3. So the entire Fortran program must read the initial input (for Java1), process through all three steps, and output the final result of Java3.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's input is N and M followed by M pairs. The second Java program takes an integer x. The third takes a string. So the output of the first program is a number (the counter), which is the input to the second program. The second program's output is a number (the prime), which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a string, but the second's output is a number. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, perhaps the three Java programs are run in sequence, each taking input from the previous output? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output is a number (the counter from AGC002_B), which is the input x for the second program (ABC149_C). The second program's output is a prime number, which is the input for the third program? But the third program expects a string. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the third program (ABC158_A) requires a string input. So perhaps there's a mistake here? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code for the third program (ABC158_A), it reads a string from input. So the output of the second program (a number) must be converted into a string to be the input for the third. So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the third program. So the third program will check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. But numbers don't have those letters. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe the problem is that the sequence is not as I thought. Wait, perhaps the three Java programs are not connected in a chain? But the user says they are executed in sequence with outputs as inputs. So maybe the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the third expects a string, so the second's output must be a string. Wait, but the second program outputs a number. So perhaps the second program's output is written as a string, and the third program reads that as a string. For example, if the second program outputs 123, then the third program's input is \"123\", which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so it would output \"No\". \n\nSo the Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence, with the outputs of each step being passed as inputs to the next. So the first step's output is an integer (counter), which is the input to the second step (the x in ABC149_C). The second step's output is an integer (prime), which is the input to the third step (the string in ABC158_A). Wait, but the third step expects a string. So the second's output must be converted to a string and passed as the input to the third. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process through all three steps, and output the final result of the third program. \n\nNow, let's plan the steps:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and M, then M pairs of integers). \n\n2. Process the first program's logic to compute the counter (number of boxes with red). \n\n3. Use that counter as the input x for the second program. \n\n4. Process the second program's logic to find the next prime (or whatever it does) and get the prime number. \n\n5. Convert that prime number into a string (since the third program expects a string input). \n\n6. Process the third program's logic to check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string. So the second program's output (a number) must be converted to a string and passed as the input to the third step. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after step 2, the counter is used as x in step 3. The result of step 3 is a number, which is then converted to a string (as a character array) and passed to step 4. \n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (AGC002_B):\n\nThe first Java program initializes N boxes. The first box has 1 marble and is red. The rest have 1 marble but not red? Wait, no: the code says:\n\nBox[] B = new Box[N];\nB[0] = new Box(1, true);\nfor (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n    B[i] = new Box(1, false);\n}\n\nWait, so each box starts with 1 marble. The first is red, others not. Then, for each move, x and y (0-based?), the move is from x to y. The move method in Box:\n\npublic void moveTo(Box other) {\n    if (num == 0) return;\n    else if (num ==1) {\n        num =0;\n        other.num++;\n        if (red) other.red = true;\n        red = false;\n    } else {\n        num--;\n        other.num++;\n        if (red) other.red = true;\n    }\n}\n\nSo when moving, if the current box has 1 marble, it transfers all to the other box, and if it was red, the other becomes red. The current box's red is set to false. \n\nIf the current has more than 1, it transfers one marble (so num decreases by 1, other increases by 1), and if the current was red, the other's red is set to true. \n\nWait, but the red flag in the other box is set to true if the current was red, but what if the other already had red? The code overwrites it. So the red flag in the destination box is set to true if the source had red, regardless of previous state. \n\nHmm, so the red flag in a box is true if any marble that was red is present. Because whenever a marble from a red box is moved, the destination's red becomes true. \n\nWait, but when moving from a box with num=1 (so all marbles are moved), then the destination's red is set to true if the source was red. \n\nIn the case of num>1, moving one marble (so the source still has marbles left), the destination's red is set to true if the source was red. \n\nTherefore, the red flag in a box is true if any marble in it came from a red source. \n\nThe final count is how many boxes have red = true. \n\nSo in Fortran, I need to model the boxes. Let's see:\n\nWe can represent each box as a structure with num and red. Since Fortran doesn't have classes, we can use arrays. Let's have two arrays: an integer array for num, and a logical array for red. \n\nInitialize:\n\nnum(1) = 1 (since Fortran arrays start at 1?), but wait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to adjust indices. Let me think: in Java, the boxes are 0-based (from 0 to N-1). In Fortran, arrays can be 1-based, so perhaps we'll have to adjust the indices. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the first box is index 0. So in Fortran, perhaps we'll have boxes from 1 to N. So when reading the moves, the x and y from input (Java uses 1-based input, subtracts 1 to get 0-based). So in Fortran, the input x and y are 1-based, so we can use them directly as indices (since Fortran arrays can be 1-based). \n\nWait, the Java code reads x and y, subtracts 1 to make them 0-based. So in Fortran, the input x and y are the same as the Java's input (since in Java, the user inputs 1-based, then subtract 1). So in Fortran, the input x and y are 1-based, so we can use them directly as indices (since Fortran arrays start at 1). \n\nSo for the first part:\n\nRead N and M, then M pairs of integers (x,y). \n\nInitialize num(1:N) as 1 for all, red(1:N) as .false. except red(1) = .true. \n\nThen for each move, process the move from x to y. \n\nThe move function's logic must be implemented. \n\nLet me think of the move steps:\n\nFor each move from box x to y:\n\ncurrent_num = num(x)\n\nif current_num ==0: do nothing.\n\nelse if current_num ==1:\n\n   num(x) =0\n\n   num(y) = num(y) +1\n\n   if red(x) then:\n\n      red(y) = .true.\n\n   red(x) = .false.\n\nelse (current_num >1):\n\n   num(x) = num(x) -1\n\n   num(y) = num(y) +1\n\n   if red(x) then:\n\n      red(y) = .true.\n\nSo in Fortran code, for each move:\n\ndo i = 1 to M\n\n   read x, y (but wait, the first program's input is N, M followed by M pairs. So in the Fortran program, the first part must read all that input first.)\n\nWait, the first program's input is N, M, then M pairs. So in the Fortran program, the first step is to read N, M, then read M pairs of integers. \n\nThen process all moves, then count the number of boxes with red = .true. \n\nThat's the first part. \n\nSecond part: the second Java program (ABC149_C) takes an integer x, and outputs the next prime number (or the first prime >=x, but with some conditions). Let me re-examine the code:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nthen enters a loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   compute sqrt(x) as sqrtNum.\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2:\n\n      if x mod i ==0, break.\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break (meaning it's prime)\n\n   else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop continues until x is prime. \n\nWait, the code starts by checking if x is even and not 2. If so, it increments x by 1 (making it odd). Then enters the loop. \n\nInside the loop, it checks for divisors from 3 to sqrt(x), stepping by 2 (so only odd divisors). \n\nIf any divisor is found (i.e., the loop breaks early), then x is not prime, so x +=2 (next odd number). \n\nElse, if after checking all i up to sqrt(x), then x is prime, so break the loop. \n\nSo the code finds the smallest prime >=x, but with some adjustments. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose x is even and not 2. Then x is set to x+1 (so odd). Then check if that is prime. If not, add 2 (so next odd). \n\nIf x was 2, then it's already prime, so the code would proceed. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose x is 3 (odd). Then the code proceeds. \n\nThe loop checks for divisors from 3 to sqrt(3) (which is ~1.732, so i starts at 3, which is larger than sqrt(x). So the for loop doesn't run. Then i is 3, which is > sqrt(x) (since sqrt(3) is ~1.732). So the condition i>sqrtNum is true, so break the loop, and output 3. \n\nAnother example: x=4. Since x is even and not 2, x becomes 5. Then check 5. sqrt(5) is ~2.236. The loop starts at i=3, which is larger than sqrt(5). So 5 is prime, so output 5. \n\nAnother example: x=6. Then x is even and not 2, so becomes 7. 7 is prime. \n\nIf x=9, then the code checks 9. Since 9 is not prime (divisible by 3). The loop runs i from 3 to 3 (since sqrt(9)=3). i=3 divides 9, so breaks. Then x +=2 to 11. Check 11. \n\nSo the code finds the next prime after x, but only if x is even. Wait, no, it's the first prime >=x, but with the adjustment for even numbers. \n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nIf x is even and not 2, then start checking from x+1 (odd). \n\nElse, start at x. \n\nThen, in the loop, it checks if x is prime. If not, increments by 2 (to next odd) and repeats. \n\nSo the code returns the smallest prime >=x, except when x is even and not 2, in which case it returns the smallest prime >=x+1. \n\nWait, but if x is even and not 2, then the code first increments x by 1 (so x becomes odd). Then proceeds. \n\nWait, the code's first line is:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nSo for x=2, it remains 2. \n\nFor x=4, becomes 5. \n\nSo the code's output is the smallest prime >=x, except when x is even and not 2, then it's the smallest prime >=x+1. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x is 9 (odd). Then the code proceeds. \n\nIf x is 8 (even and not 2), then x becomes 9. \n\nSo the code's output is the first prime >=x, but if x was even (except 2), it's the first prime >=x+1. \n\nHmm, but the code's logic is to first adjust x to x+1 if even (except 2), then find the next prime starting from that x. \n\nSo the code's output is the first prime >= (x if x is odd or 2, else x+1). \n\nTherefore, the code effectively finds the next prime after x, but if x is even and not 2, it skips x and starts at x+1. \n\nSo in Fortran, the second part takes the counter from the first part (let's call it count1), uses that as x, then computes the next prime as per the code's logic. \n\nThird part: the third Java program (ABC158_A) takes a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\nBut the input to this third program is the output of the second program, which is a number. So the number is converted to a string, and that string is checked. \n\nFor example, if the second program outputs 13, then the third program's input is \"13\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B', so output is \"No\". \n\nSo in Fortran, after getting the prime number (let's call it prime_num), we need to convert it to a string, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\nWait, but numbers don't have letters. So the string will only have digits, so the answer will always be \"No\" unless the prime_num is part of a string that includes letters. But since the input is the number's string representation, it can't have letters. \n\nHmm, but the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the second program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the third program. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after computing prime_num, we need to convert it to a string (e.g., using write and read), then check for presence of 'A' and 'B'. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N, M, then M pairs of integers (x,y). \n\n2. Process the boxes as per the first Java program, compute count1 (number of boxes with red). \n\n3. Use count1 as x in the second part. \n\n4. Compute the next prime (prime_num) as per the second Java's logic. \n\n5. Convert prime_num to a string (e.g., using a character array). \n\n6. Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n7. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly. \n\nNow, let's think about the steps in Fortran code. \n\nFirst, variables:\n\nFor the first part:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_boxes = some value? Well, since N can be up to... Well, in Java, it's an int, so up to 2^31, but in Fortran, we can use dynamic arrays. Wait, but in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with a size. Hmm, but the problem may not specify constraints. Since the user hasn't given constraints, perhaps we can assume that N is manageable. Alternatively, use a large enough size. \n\nAlternatively, read N first, then allocate arrays. \n\nBut in Fortran, we can read N first, then allocate the arrays. \n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, M, i, x, y, count1, prime_num\nlogical :: red(100000) ! assuming N up to 1e5, but maybe better to read N first\ninteger :: num(100000)\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_prime\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\n! Read N and M first, then allocate arrays if needed. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, if we don't know N in advance, we can read N first, then allocate. \n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps set a large enough array size. Let's say 1e5. \n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation. \n\nLet me proceed with dynamic allocation. \n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: num(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: red(:)\n\nread(*,*) N, M\n\nallocate(num(N), red(N))\n\nnum = 1\nred = .false.\nred(1) = .true.\n\ndo i = 1, M\n   read(*,*) x, y\n   call move_box(x, y, num, red)\nend do\n\ncount1 = count(red)\n\ndeallocate(num, red)\n\n! Now process second part\n\nx = count1\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n   x = x +1\nend if\n\nprime_num = x\n\ndo while (.true.)\n   logical :: is_prime = .true.\n   integer :: sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(prime_num)))\n   if (prime_num ==1) then\n      is_prime = .false.\n   else if (prime_num ==2) then\n      is_prime = .true.\n   else\n      do i=3, sqrt_x, 2\n         if (mod(prime_num, i) ==0) then\n            is_prime = .false.\n            exit\n         end if\n      end do\n   end if\n   if (is_prime) exit\n   prime_num = prime_num +2\nend do\n\n! Now third part: convert prime_num to string and check for A and B\n\nwrite(s_prime, '(i0)') prime_num\n\nhasA = .false.\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_prime)\n   if (s_prime(i:i) == 'A') then\n      hasA = .true.\n   else if (s_prime(i:i) == 'B') then\n      hasB = .true.\n   end if\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n   print *, 'Yes'\nelse\n   print *, 'No'\nend if\n\ncontains\n\nsubroutine move_box(x, y, num, red)\n   integer, intent(in) :: x, y\n   integer, intent(inout) :: num(:)\n   logical, intent(inout) :: red(:)\n   integer :: current_num\n\n   current_num = num(x)\n   if (current_num ==0) return\n\n   if (current_num ==1) then\n      num(x) =0\n      num(y) = num(y) +1\n      if (red(x)) then\n         red(y) = .true.\n      end if\n      red(x) = .false.\n   else\n      num(x) = num(x) -1\n      num(y) = num(y) +1\n      if (red(x)) then\n         red(y) = .true.\n      end if\n   end if\nend subroutine move_box\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some issues here. Let me check:\n\nFirst, in the second part, the code for finding the prime. \n\nThe initial x is set to count1. Then, if x is even and not 2, x becomes x+1. Then, the loop starts with prime_num =x. \n\nWait, in the code above, after adjusting x, prime_num is set to x. Then the loop checks if it's prime. If not, adds 2. \n\nWait, the code in the Java second program's loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   compute sqrt(x) as sqrtNum.\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2:\n\n      if divisible, break.\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break (prime found)\n\n   else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nIn the Fortran code above, the loop is a do while (true) loop. \n\nWait, in the code I wrote, the loop is:\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   compute is_prime.\n\n   if is_prime, exit.\n\n   else, prime_num +=2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the for loop, if the for loop didn't find a divisor (i.e., i exceeds sqrt(x)), then break the loop (so x is prime). \n\nElse, x +=2. \n\nIn the Fortran code, the code is:\n\nif (is_prime) exit\n\nelse, prime_num = prime_num +2\n\nWait, but in the code above, the code is:\n\nif (is_prime) exit\n\nelse, prime_num +=2\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote, the code is:\n\nif (is_prime) exit\n\nelse:\n\n   prime_num = prime_num +2\n\nBut in the Java code, the increment is done only when not prime. \n\nWait, the code in the Java is:\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) break; // prime found, exit loop\n\nelse { // not prime\n\n   x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the code is correct. \n\nBut in the code I wrote, the code is:\n\nif (is_prime) exit\n\nelse:\n\n   prime_num = prime_num +2\n\nSo that's correct. \n\nBut in the code above, the initial prime_num is set to x (the adjusted x). \n\nWait, but in the code I wrote, after adjusting x (if needed), prime_num is set to x. Then the loop starts. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, the for loop starts at 3 and steps by 2. So in Fortran, the loop is from 3 to sqrt_x, step 2. \n\nWait, in the code above, the loop is:\n\ndo i=3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n   if mod(prime_num, i) ==0 \u2192 not prime.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop runs from 3 to sqrt(x), incrementing by 2. So that's correct. \n\nBut what about sqrt_x? The sqrt in Fortran is a function, so sqrt(real(prime_num)) gives the square root as a real number. Then converting to integer. \n\nWait, in the code above, sqrt_x is int(sqrt(real(prime_num))). \n\nYes. \n\nAnother point: the case when prime_num is 1. The code sets is_prime to false. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the third part: converting prime_num to a string. \n\nUsing write(s_prime, '(i0)') prime_num. \n\nThen, check each character in s_prime for 'A' or 'B'. \n\nBut since prime_num is a number, the string will only have digits, so hasA and hasB will remain false. \n\nTherefore, the output will always be \"No\" unless the prime_num is something like 123A, but that's impossible. \n\nWait, but the third program's input is the output of the second program. The second program outputs a number, which is written as a string. So the third program's input is that string. \n\nSo for example, if the second program outputs 13, the third program's input is \"13\", which has no A or B \u2192 output No. \n\nIf the second program outputs 2, then input is \"2\" \u2192 No. \n\nIf the second program outputs 101, input is \"101\" \u2192 No. \n\nSo the third program will always output \"No\" unless the second program's output is a number that when written as a string contains both 'A' and 'B', which is impossible. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the third program is supposed to take the output of the second as a string, but the second's output is a number, so the third's input is that number's string representation. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nNow, let's check the move_box subroutine. \n\nThe subroutine takes x and y, and the arrays num and red. \n\nThe current_num is num(x). \n\nIf current_num is 0 \u2192 return. \n\nElse if current_num ==1:\n\n   set num(x) to 0, add 1 to y's num. \n\n   if red(x) was true \u2192 set red(y) to true. \n\n   set red(x) to false. \n\nElse (current_num >1):\n\n   subtract 1 from x's num, add 1 to y's. \n\n   if red(x) \u2192 set red(y) to true. \n\nWait, but in the code above, in the else part (current_num >1), after moving, the red(x) is not set to false. \n\nWait, in the Java code's moveTo method, when num>1, the code does:\n\nnum--;\n\nother.num++;\n\nif (red) other.red = true;\n\nSo the source's red remains as it was. \n\nYes, so in the Fortran code, in the else part (current_num>1), after moving, the red(x) is not changed. \n\nWait, in the code I wrote for the else part:\n\nif (current_num ==1) then\n\n   ... set red(x) to false.\n\nelse:\n\n   ... \n\n   if (red(x)) then \u2192 set red(y) to true.\n\n   but the red(x) remains as it was. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the code for the move is correct. \n\nNow, the count(red) is the number of elements in the red array that are .true. \n\nIn Fortran, the intrinsic function count(red) does exactly that. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nNow, the code for the second part:\n\nWait, after adjusting x (if even and not 2), the initial prime_num is set to x. \n\nThen, in the loop, we check if prime_num is prime. \n\nIf not, add 2 and repeat. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for the third part:\n\nThe string s_prime is written with '(i0)', which is the standard integer to string conversion. \n\nThen, loop over each character. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string may have leading spaces or other characters? \n\nUsing '(i0)' should write the number without leading spaces. \n\nThen, the loop checks each character. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose N=1, M=0. \n\nThen the first program's count is 1 (only box 1 has red). \n\nSecond program's x is 1. \n\nThen, since x is 1 (odd, not 2), so x remains 1. \n\nThen, the code checks if 1 is prime. \n\nIn the code, since prime_num is 1, is_prime is set to false. \n\nSo loop continues. \n\nprime_num becomes 3 (since 1+2=3). \n\nCheck 3: sqrt(3) is ~1.732 \u2192 integer 1. \n\nLoop from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. \n\nThus, is_prime is true (since prime_num is 3, and the loop didn't find any divisors). \n\nWait, no. Wait, when prime_num is 3:\n\nsqrt_x = 1 (since sqrt(3) is ~1.732 \u2192 int(1.732) is 1. \n\nThe loop starts at 3, but the upper limit is 1. So the loop doesn't run. \n\nThus, the code proceeds to check if prime_num is 3. \n\nThe code's is_prime is set to true (since it's not 1, and the loop didn't find any divisors). \n\nThus, the prime_num is 3. \n\nThen, converting to string \"3\" \u2192 no A or B \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose the first program's count is 2. \n\nSecond program's x is 2 (even but it's 2, so no adjustment. \n\nCheck if 2 is prime \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, prime_num is 2. \n\nString is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nAnother case where the second program's output is 13 \u2192 \"13\" \u2192 No. \n\nAnother case where the second program's output is 101 \u2192 \"101\" \u2192 No. \n\nThus, the third program will always output \"No\" unless the second program's output is a number that when written as a string contains both 'A' and 'B', which is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nNow, let me check the code again for possible errors. \n\nIn the move_box subroutine, the parameters are intent(inout) for num and red. \n\nYes. \n\nThe variables x and y are passed as integers. \n\nThe code for moving when current_num is 1: \n\nnum(x) is set to 0, y's num increases by 1. \n\nRed(y) is set to true if red(x) was true. \n\nRed(x) is set to false. \n\nYes. \n\nElse (current_num>1):\n\nnum(x) decreases by 1, y increases by 1. \n\nRed(y) is set to true if red(x) was true. \n\nRed(x) remains as it was. \n\nYes. \n\nThe count(red) is correct. \n\nThe second part's code for primes: \n\nThe loop starts with prime_num = x (adjusted). \n\nThe loop continues until a prime is found. \n\nThe code for checking divisors is correct. \n\nThe third part's string conversion and checking is correct. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, after the first part, the arrays are deallocated. \n\nBut in the second and third parts, they are not needed. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother thing: in the second part, the initial x is count1. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nWait, in the code I wrote, the loop is:\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   compute is_prime.\n\n   if (is_prime) exit\n\n   else:\n\n      prime_num = prime_num +2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the for loop, if the for loop didn't break (i.e., no divisors found), then the loop breaks (prime found). \n\nElse, x +=2. \n\nIn the Fortran code, the code is correct. \n\nAnother possible issue: when prime_num is even and greater than 2. \n\nWait, after the initial adjustment, prime_num is either odd (if x was even and not 2, then prime_num starts at x+1, which is odd). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose x is even and not 2 \u2192 x is adjusted to x+1 (odd). \n\nThen, in the loop, if the current prime_num is not prime, we add 2, so it remains odd. \n\nThus, the code only checks odd numbers. \n\nYes, which is correct. \n\nAnother case: x=3 (odd). \n\nprime_num starts at 3. \n\nCheck if prime. \n\nYes, so loop exits. \n\nThus, correct. \n\nAnother case: x=4 \u2192 adjusted to 5. \n\nCheck 5 is prime \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, correct. \n\nAnother case: x=9 (odd). \n\nCheck 9: divisible by 3 \u2192 not prime. \n\nAdd 2 \u2192 11. \n\nCheck 11 \u2192 prime. \n\nThus, correct. \n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as written above. \n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, the subroutine is inside the program. \n\nYes, using the 'contains' block. \n\nAlso, the variables are properly declared. \n\nI think that's it. \n\nNow, let me write the final code."
