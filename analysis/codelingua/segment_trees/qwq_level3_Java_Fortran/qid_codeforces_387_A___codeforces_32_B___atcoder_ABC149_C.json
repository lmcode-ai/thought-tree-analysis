But the problem might be expecting the difference between the two times as a duration, but the code is written in a way that subtracts the hours and minutes of the second time from the first. So the first program's output is the time resulting from x minus (y's hours and minutes). So in Fortran, I need to parse the two times, compute the new time by subtracting the hours and minutes of the second time from the first, then format it as HH:mm.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_387_A) takes two time inputs in HH:MM format, converts them into LocalTime objects, subtracts the second time from the first, and prints the result. Wait, actually, looking at the code, it's not exactly subtracting y from x. Let me check again. The code does x.minusHours(y.getHour()).minusMinutes(y.getMinute()). Oh right, so it subtracts the hours and minutes of y from x. So if x is 10:30 and y is 2:15, the result would be 8:15. But I need to make sure how LocalTime handles this. Since LocalTime is a time of day, subtracting hours and minutes would just adjust the time accordingly, possibly going into negative times? Or does it wrap around? Hmm, but the problem might be expecting a duration. Wait, the code's output is a LocalTime, which might not be correct for durations over 24 hours. But the problem might be designed such that the result is within a day. Anyway, the first program's output is a time string, like \"HH:MM\".\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_32_B) takes a string of characters (probably a sequence of '.' and other characters?), and processes each character. It uses a state variable 's' (a boolean). The logic is: for each character, if it's a '.', then if 's' was true, print 1 and set s to false. Else, print 0. If the character is not a '.', then if s was true, print 2 and reset s, else set s to true. The output is a sequence of 0,1,2 digits. The input here is the output of the first program, which is a time string like \"HH:MM\". Wait, but the second program's input is read via in.next(), which would take the entire next token. The first program's output is a LocalTime, which when printed, would be in HH:mm format. So the input to the second program is a string like \"12:34\". But the second program processes each character of that string. Let me see: the input is a string like \"12:34\", so the characters are '1', '2', ':', '3', '4'. The processing would go through each of these.\n\nThe third Java program (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an integer x from input, and finds the smallest prime number greater than or equal to x, but with some conditions. Wait, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me parse it. The code starts by checking if x is 2 or an even number. If x is not 2 and even, it increments x by 1 (so making it odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until a prime is found. The check is done by iterating from 3 up to sqrt(x), stepping by 2. If any divisor is found, it breaks and increments x by 2 (to keep it odd). The output is the first prime >= x (with adjustments). Wait, but the code's initial condition: if x is 2, it stays. If x is even and not 2, it becomes x+1 (so odd). Then the loop checks for primes. So the third program takes an integer input, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is a sequence of digits (0,1,2) from processing the time string. So the input to the third program is that sequence of digits concatenated, forming an integer. Wait, but the second program's output is a series of numbers printed, so for example, if the output is \"012\", then the third program would read that as the integer 12? Wait, no. The third program uses stdIn.next() which reads the next token. The second program's output is a series of digits (each 0,1, or 2) printed one after another, so the entire output is a string like \"012345\". The third program reads that as a single integer. So the input to the third program is the concatenated digits from the second's output, which must form a valid integer. So the third program's input is that number, and it outputs the next prime.\n\nNow, the task is to combine all three into a single Fortran program. The first step is to read the input (the two times) from stdin, process them through all three steps, and output the final result (the prime number) to stdout. The intermediate steps must not do any I/O.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the two time strings (like \"HH:MM\" each) from input.\n2. Process them as per the first Java program to get the resulting time string (the output of first Java program).\n3. Then, process that time string through the second Java's logic to get a sequence of digits (0,1,2).\n4. Then, take that sequence of digits as a number (the input to the third program) and compute the prime as per the third Java's logic.\n5. Finally, output that prime.\n\nNow, let's break down each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first Java program's logic:\n\nThe first program takes two times, splits into hours and minutes, converts to LocalTime, then subtracts the hours and minutes of the second time from the first. Wait, the code is x.minusHours(y.getHour()).minusMinutes(y.getMinute()). So, for example, if x is 10:30 and y is 2:15, then subtract 2 hours and 15 minutes from x, resulting in 8:15. But LocalTime's minusHours and minusMinutes can handle negative times? Or does it wrap around? Well, the code's output is a LocalTime, which is a time of day, so if the result is negative, it would be something like 22:45 (if subtracting 2 hours and 15 minutes from 00:00 would be 21:45? Not sure, but perhaps the problem expects that the result is just the time after subtracting the hours and minutes, possibly going into negative hours, but the LocalTime would adjust accordingly. However, in Java, LocalTime can't have negative hours, so perhaps the code is intended to compute the difference as a duration? Wait, but the code is using minusHours and minusMinutes, which would subtract those values from the original time. For example, if x is 01:00 and y is 02:00, then x minus 2 hours would be 23:00 (since 1-2 = -1 hour, which wraps to 23:00?), but then minus another 0 minutes. So the result would be 23:00. But the problem might be expecting the difference between the two times as a duration, but the code is written in a way that subtracts the hours and minutes of the second time from the first. So the first program's output is the time resulting from x minus (y's hours and minutes). So in Fortran, I need to parse the two times, compute the new time by subtracting the hours and minutes of the second time from the first, then format it as HH:mm.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\n- Read two strings, each like \"HH:MM\".\n- Split each into hours and minutes (as integers).\n- Compute new_time = first_time minus (y_hrs hours and y_mins minutes).\n- Format new_time as HH:mm, which will be the input to the second program.\n\nWait, but how to handle the time subtraction in Fortran. Let's think in terms of total minutes.\n\nFirst, parse the first time into hours and minutes: h1, m1.\n\nSimilarly for the second time: h2, m2.\n\nThe new time's total minutes would be (h1 * 60 + m1) - (h2 * 60 + m2). But since it's a time of day, it wraps modulo 1440 (24*60). Wait, but in Java's LocalTime, if you subtract hours and minutes beyond the current time, it would go into negative, but LocalTime can't represent that. Wait, actually, the minusHours and minusMinutes methods can take negative values? Or do they subtract the given hours and minutes. For example, if the original time is 00:00 and you subtract 1 hour, it would become 23:00 of the previous day. So the result is a valid LocalTime. So the total minutes would be (h1*60 + m1) - (h2*60 + m2). But since it's a time, it's modulo 1440. So the new time is (total_minutes) mod 1440. But if the result is negative, adding 1440 until it's positive.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose first time is 01:00 (60 minutes), second time is 02:00 (120 minutes). The difference is 60 - 120 = -60. Adding 1440 gives 1380 minutes, which is 23 hours. So 23:00.\n\nSo in Fortran, I can compute the total minutes for each time, subtract the second's total from the first's, then mod 1440, then convert back to hours and minutes.\n\nSo:\n\ntotal1 = h1 * 60 + m1\n\ntotal2 = h2 * 60 + m2\n\nresult_total = total1 - total2\n\nif result_total < 0, add 1440 until it's positive (mod 1440)\n\nthen:\n\nresult_h = result_total / 60\n\nresult_m = result_total mod 60\n\nThen format as HH:MM, with leading zeros if needed.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part: processing the time string through the second Java's logic.\n\nThe second program takes the time string (like \"HH:MM\") and processes each character. Let's see the code again:\n\nThe input is a string (from first program's output), which is like \"HH:MM\".\n\nThe code converts it to a char array, then loops over each character.\n\nThe state 's' is a boolean, initially false.\n\nFor each character:\n\nif the character is '.' :\n\n   if s is true: print 1, set s to false\n\n   else: print 0\n\nelse (not '.'):\n\n   if s is true: print 2, set s to false\n\n   else: set s to true\n\nWait, the else part (when the character is not '.'):\n\nif s is true, then print 2 and set s to false.\n\nElse, set s to true.\n\nWait, let me rephrase the code's logic for non '.' characters:\n\nElse (the character is not '.'):\n\n   if (s) {\n\n       System.out.print(2);\n\n       s = false;\n\n   } else {\n\n       s = true;\n\n   }\n\nSo for non '.' characters, if s was true, output 2 and turn s off. Else, just set s to true.\n\nSo the processing is as follows:\n\nThe input is a string like \"12:34\".\n\nEach character is processed in order.\n\nLet me walk through an example:\n\nSuppose the input is \"12:34\".\n\nCharacters: '1', '2', ':', '3', '4'.\n\nInitial s = false.\n\nProcessing '1' (not '.'):\n\nsince s is false, set s to true. Output nothing here except the 2 is not printed here.\n\nWait, no. The code for non '.' characters:\n\nif s is true, then print 2 and set s to false.\n\nElse, set s to true.\n\nSo for first character '1', s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output here.\n\nSecond character '2' (not '.'):\n\ns is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false.\n\nThird character ':' (not '.'):\n\ns is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nFourth character '3' (not '.'):\n\ns is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false.\n\nFifth character '4' (not '.'):\n\ns is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSo the output would be \"22\".\n\nWait, let's see step by step:\n\nProcessing '1':\n\ns starts as false.\n\nSince it's not '.', check s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nProcessing '2':\n\ns is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false. So output '2'.\n\nProcessing ':', not '.'.\n\ns is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nProcessing '3':\n\ns is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false. Output '2'.\n\nProcessing '4':\n\ns is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSo the total output is \"22\".\n\nWait, but the third character is ':', which is not '.' so the code's logic applies. So the output is \"22\".\n\nHmm, okay. So the second program's output is a string of digits (0,1,2) based on processing each character of the input string (the time from first program).\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to take the time string (like \"HH:MM\"), process each character through this logic, and collect the digits into a string, which will be the input to the third program.\n\nThird program's input is that digit string as an integer. Wait, but the third program reads the input as an integer. So the digit string must form a valid integer. For example, if the second program outputs \"22\", then the third program reads 22 as the input x.\n\nSo the third program's logic is to find the smallest prime >= x (with some adjustments). Let me look at the code again.\n\nThird Java code:\n\nThe code starts by checking if x is not 2 and even, then x is increased by 1 (so it becomes odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until a prime is found.\n\nThe prime check is done by iterating from 3 to sqrt(x), stepping by 2. If any divisor is found, break and increment x by 2 (to keep it odd). Else, break and output x.\n\nWait, the code's loop is a bit tricky. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++; // So if x is even and not 2, make it odd.\n\nThen, while (true):\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n\n       if (x % i == 0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break; // means no divisors found, so prime.\n\n   else, x += 2; // increment by 2 to keep it odd.\n\nSo the loop continues until x is prime. The initial x is adjusted to be odd (unless it's 2). Then, in each iteration, check if x is divisible by any odd number up to sqrt(x). If not, break and return x. Else, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nSo the third program's logic is to find the smallest prime >= x, but with the adjustment that if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1 (so odd). So for example, if x is 2, it stays. If x is 3, it's prime. If x is 4, it becomes 5, then check if 5 is prime (yes). So the output is 5.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read two time strings (each like \"HH:MM\") from input.\n\n2. Process them to get the resulting time string (HH:MM) as per first Java program.\n\n3. Process that time string through the second Java's logic to get a digit string (e.g., \"22\").\n\n4. Convert that digit string to an integer x.\n\n5. Compute the smallest prime >= x (with the adjustments from the third Java code).\n\n6. Output that prime.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (time processing):\n\nRead the two time strings. Let's use a character array for each.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read them with read(*,*) but need to handle the colons. Alternatively, read as a string and split.\n\nWait, in Fortran, perhaps read the entire line as a string, then split into two parts.\n\nAlternatively, read each time as a string, then split into hours and minutes.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFirst, read the first time string. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: time1, time2\n\nread(*,*) time1, time2\n\nBut the input would be two strings separated by space, like \"12:34 01:23\".\n\nThen, split each into hours and minutes.\n\nFor time1:\n\nh1 = first two characters, m1 the next two (since the format is HH:MM, so the first two are hours, then colon, then two minutes.\n\nWait, the string is like \"HH:MM\", so the first two characters are the hours, the third is colon, fourth and fifth are minutes.\n\nWait, the length is 5 (since \"HH:MM\" has 5 characters). So for time1(1:2) is hours, time1(4:5) is minutes.\n\nSimilarly for time2.\n\nSo:\n\nread(*,*) time1, time2\n\nh1 = int(time1(1:2)) \u2192 but need to convert the substring to integer.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert a substring to integer, we can use internal reads.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(time1(1:2), '(I2)') h1\n\nread(time1(4:5), '(I2)') m1\n\nSame for time2:\n\nread(time2(1:2), '(I2)') h2\n\nread(time2(4:5), '(I2)') m2\n\nThen compute total1 = h1 * 60 + m1\n\ntotal2 = h2 * 60 + m2\n\nresult_total = total1 - total2\n\nif (result_total < 0) then\n\n   result_total = result_total + 1440\n\nend if\n\nThen compute hours and minutes:\n\nresult_h = result_total / 60\n\nresult_m = mod(result_total, 60)\n\nThen format as a string with leading zeros.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: result_time\n\nwrite(result_time, '(I2.2,A1,I2.2)') result_h, ':', result_m\n\nWait, in Fortran, the format for writing with leading zeros can be done with I2.2. So:\n\nwrite(result_time, '(I2.2,A,I2.2)') result_h, ':', result_m\n\nWait, but the format needs to be properly specified. Let me think:\n\nThe format for the hours and minutes should be two digits each, with a colon in between.\n\nSo the format string would be '(I2.2,A1,I2.2)'. The A1 is for the colon.\n\nSo:\n\nwrite(result_time, '(I2.2,A1,I2.2)') result_h, ':', result_m\n\nBut need to make sure that the result_time is properly formatted.\n\nOnce we have the result_time string, that's the input to the second step.\n\nSecond step: process each character of result_time through the second Java's logic.\n\nWe need to loop over each character in result_time, track the state 's' (a logical variable), and collect the output digits.\n\nInitialize s = .false.\n\noutput_digits = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(result_time)\n\n   c = result_time(i:i)\n\n   if (c == ':') then\n\n      ! Not a '.' so process as non '.' case.\n\n      if (s) then\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '2'\n\n          s = .false.\n\n      else\n\n          s = .true.\n\n      end if\n\n   else if (c == '.') then\n\n      if (s) then\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '1'\n\n          s = .false.\n\n      else\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '0'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      ! It's a digit (like '1', '2', etc.)\n\n      if (s) then\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '2'\n\n          s = .false.\n\n      else\n\n          s = .true.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the second Java code, the input is a string like \"HH:MM\", which contains digits and a colon. The code processes each character, including the colon. The colon is not a '.' so it's handled in the else clause (non '.' case).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the input is the time string, which includes the colon. So in the example above, the colon is part of the input and is processed.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the colon is part of the input string, so in the loop, when the character is a colon, it's treated as a non '.' character, so the code proceeds as per the else clause.\n\nWait, in the code above, the code for colon is handled in the first condition (c == ':'), which is part of the else clause (non '.' case). So that's correct.\n\nWait, in the code above, the first check is if c is a colon, then process as non '.' case. But the code's logic for non '.' is the else clause in the Java code. So the code above is correct.\n\nWait, the code in Java for non '.' characters (including colon) is:\n\nif (c is not '.'):\n\n   if (s is true):\n\n       print 2, set s to false\n\n   else:\n\n       set s to true\n\nSo in the Fortran code, for any character that is not '.', including colon, the code must check s and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, in the code above, the first condition is checking if c is a colon, but that's redundant. Because the colon is not a '.' so it would fall into the else clause. Wait, perhaps better to structure it as:\n\nif (c == '.') then\n\n   process as per '.' case\n\nelse\n\n   process as per non '.' case\n\nend if\n\nSo the code can be restructured as:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(result_time)\n\n   c = result_time(i:i)\n\n   if (c == '.') then\n\n      if (s) then\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '1'\n\n          s = .false.\n\n      else\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '0'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (s) then\n\n          output_digits = trim(output_digits) // '2'\n\n          s = .false.\n\n      else\n\n          s = .true.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, any character that is not '.' (including colon, digits, etc.) is handled in the else clause.\n\nYes, this is better. So the code above can be simplified.\n\nSo the output_digits will be a string of 0,1,2 characters.\n\nOnce we have output_digits, that's the input to the third step.\n\nThird step: convert output_digits to an integer x.\n\nx = int(output_digits)\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert a string to integer, we can use internal read:\n\nread(output_digits, '(I)') x\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is a valid integer. Since the digits are 0,1,2, it should be okay.\n\nOnce x is obtained, then compute the prime as per the third Java code.\n\nNow, implementing the third step's logic in Fortran.\n\nThe code's logic:\n\nif x is not 2 and even, then x +=1 (to make it odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\n   compute sqrt(x)\n\n   check divisors from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2.\n\n   if any divisor found, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nElse, break and output x.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, handle the initial adjustment:\n\nif (x /= 2 .and. mod(x,2) == 0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\nThen, loop:\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x))\n\n   found = .false.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) == 0) then\n\n          found = .true.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. found) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x + 2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is while true, and after checking, if found (i.e., not prime), then x +=2 and loop again.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIn the Java code, after the for loop, if (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 meaning that the loop ran all the way to sqrtNum without breaking, so no divisors found \u2192 break the while loop.\n\nElse, increment x by 2 and loop again.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code can be written as:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x))\n\n   ! Initialize i to 3, loop up to sqrt_num, step 2.\n\n   found = .false.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) == 0) then\n\n          found = .true.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. found) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x + 2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop is do while (true), but in Fortran, you can't have an infinite loop like that. Wait, in Fortran, you can use a do loop with a label and exit.\n\nAlternatively, use a do-while construct with a condition that is always true, but in Fortran, the do while is at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use a loop with a flag.\n\nAlternatively, use a do loop with a label and exit when found.\n\nAlternatively, here's the code:\n\ndo\n\n   sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x))\n\n   found = .false.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) == 0) then\n\n          found = .true.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. found) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x + 2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis is an infinite loop (do ... end do) that exits when a prime is found.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read the two time strings, process them, then process the result through the second step, then third.\n\nVariables needed:\n\nFor first part:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: time1, time2\n\ninteger :: h1, m1, h2, m2, total1, total2, result_total, result_h, result_m\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: result_time\n\nFor second part:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: output_digits (assuming the result_time is 5 characters, so the output_digits can be up to 5 characters, but maybe longer? Wait, the result_time is 5 characters (HH:MM), so 5 characters. So processing each of the 5 characters may produce up to 5 digits? Let's see:\n\nTake \"HH:MM\" \u2192 5 characters. Each character can produce a digit (except when the character is not '.' and the code doesn't output anything except when s is true and it's a non '.' character).\n\nWait, in the second Java code, for each character, sometimes a digit is printed, sometimes not. Let's see:\n\nFor each character:\n\nIf it's a '.' \u2192 then either 0 or 1 is printed.\n\nIf it's not '.' \u2192 then if s was true, 2 is printed and s is set to false. Else, no digit is printed, but s is set to true.\n\nWait, in the non '.' case, the code only prints 2 when s was true. Else, it just sets s to true but doesn't print anything.\n\nSo for each character, the output can be 0,1, or 2, or nothing?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the code:\n\nIn the non '.' case:\n\nif (s is true):\n\n   print 2, set s to false.\n\nelse:\n\n   set s to true \u2192 no output.\n\nSo for non '.' characters, sometimes a 2 is printed, sometimes nothing.\n\nSo the output_digits can be shorter than the input length.\n\nFor example, in the earlier example of \"12:34\" (5 characters):\n\nProcessing gives \"22\" (2 digits).\n\nAnother example: \"00:00\" \u2192 characters '0','0',':','0','0'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial s = false.\n\nFirst '0' (non '.'): s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSecond '0': s is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false. So output '2'.\n\nThird ':': s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nFourth '0': s is true \u2192 print 2, set s to false. Output '2'.\n\nFifth '0': s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nTotal output is \"22\".\n\nAnother example: \"12:34\" \u2192 as before, gives \"22\".\n\nAnother example: \"1.:34\" (if the input had a '.' in the time, but the first program's output would not have a '.' since it's a time string. Wait, the first program's output is a time in HH:mm format, so it can't have '.' in it. So the second program's input will only have digits and colon. So the '.' case won't occur. But the code must handle it anyway.\n\nSo the output_digits can be up to 5 characters (if all characters except the colon produce a digit). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the input is \"1.:34\" (but that's not possible from first program's output). But in code, the '.' would be processed as:\n\nFor the '.' character:\n\nif s is true \u2192 print 1 and set s to false.\n\nElse \u2192 print 0.\n\nSo in that case, the '.' would contribute a 0 or 1.\n\nBut in the first program's output, the time is in HH:mm, so no '.'.\n\nThus, in the actual scenario, the second program's input has no '.' characters, so all characters are digits or colon.\n\nThus, the output_digits can be up to 5 characters, but in practice, maybe less.\n\nSo in Fortran, to handle the output_digits, we can use a character variable of sufficient length, say 10.\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: output_digits\n\nInitialize it as an empty string.\n\noutput_digits = ''\n\nThen, during processing, append each digit as needed.\n\nNow, the third part variables:\n\ninteger :: x, i, sqrt_num, found\n\nWait, sqrt_num is a real number, since sqrt returns a real.\n\nSo variables:\n\nreal :: sqrt_num\n\nlogical :: found\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\n! Variables for first part\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: time1, time2\n\ninteger :: h1, m1, h2, m2, total1, total2, result_total, result_h, result_m\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: result_time\n\n!

Output the result\n\nprint*, x\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third part's loop, the inner loop's upper limit is int(sqrt_num). Because i is an integer, so we need to cast sqrt_num to integer.\n\nYes, because the loop variable i is integer, so the upper limit must be integer.\n\nSo the inner loop is from 3 to int(sqrt_num), stepping by 2.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's input: \"00:00\" and \"00:00\".\n\nThen result_total is 0 \u2192 00:00 \u2192 result_time is \"00:00\".\n\nSecond part processing:\n\nCharacters: '0','0',':','0','0'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial s = false.\n\nFirst '0' (non '.'): s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSecond '0': s is true \u2192 output '2', set s to false.\n\nThird ':': s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nFourth '0': s is true \u2192 output '2', set s to false.\n\nFifth '0': s is false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSo output_digits is \"22\".\n\nThird part: x = 22.\n\nCheck if x is even and not 2 \u2192 yes. So x becomes 23.\n\nNow check if 23 is prime.\n\nsqrt(23) is ~4.795, so int(sqrt_num) is 4.\n\nLoop i from 3 to 4, step 2 \u2192 i=3.\n\nCheck 23 mod 3 \u2192 23/3 is 7*3=21, remainder 2 \u2192 not divisible. So found remains false.\n\nThus, exit loop. So x is 23, which is prime. Output 23.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program input: \"02:30\" and \"01:15\".\n\nFirst time: 2*60 +30 = 150.\n\nSecond time: 1*60 +15 = 75.\n\nresult_total = 150-75 =75 \u2192 1h15m \u2192 \"01:15\".\n\nSecond part processing:\n\nCharacters '0','1',':','1','5'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial s = false.\n\nFirst '0' \u2192 non '.' \u2192 s false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSecond '1' \u2192 s true \u2192 output '2', set s to false.\n\nThird ':' \u2192 s false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nFourth '1' \u2192 s true \u2192 output '2', set s to false.\n\nFifth '5' \u2192 s false \u2192 set s to true. No output.\n\nSo output_digits is \"22\".\n\nSame as before, leading to x=22 \u2192 becomes 23, output 23.\n\nAnother test case where the second program's output is different.\n\nSuppose first program's output is \"12:34\".\n\nProcessing gives \"22\" \u2192 x=22 \u2192 23.\n\nAnother case where the second program's output is \"0\".\n\nSuppose the input to second program is \"00:00\" \u2192 output_digits is \"22\".\n\nWait, let's think of a case where a '.' is present. Suppose the first program's output is \"1.:34\" (though impossible, but code must handle it).\n\nBut in reality, the first program's output is a time string without '.'.\n\nAnother test case for second program:\n\nInput string \"1.34\" (but again, not possible from first program, but code must handle it).\n\nBut since the first program's output is a time, the second program's input won't have '.'.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nIn the first part, when formatting the result_time, the write statement may have issues with the format.\n\nThe format is '(I2.2,A1,I2.2)'.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the format for writing an integer with leading zeros is Iw.d where d is the field width. So I2.2 means a field of 2 characters, with leading zeros.\n\nSo writing result_h as I2.2 will give two digits, like 05 for 5.\n\nSimilarly for the minutes.\n\nThus, the result_time should be correctly formatted as \"HH:MM\".\n\nAnother possible issue is when the result_total is exactly 1440 \u2192 which would be 0, so 00:00.\n\nAnother edge case: result_total = 1439 \u2192 23:59.\n\nYes, that would be handled correctly.\n\nNow, the third part's loop:\n\nWhen x is 2, it's even but equals 2, so no adjustment. Then check if 2 is prime \u2192 yes, so output 2.\n\nAnother case: x=3 \u2192 prime, so output 3.\n\nx=4 \u2192 becomes 5 (prime).\n\nx=6 \u2192 becomes 7 (prime).\n\nx=9 \u2192 check if 9 is prime. The loop:\n\nsqrt(9) is 3. So check i from 3 to 3.\n\ni=3 \u2192 9 mod 3 is 0 \u2192 found is true. So x becomes 11 (9+2=11? Wait, no. Wait, x starts at 9 (since 9 is odd).\n\nWait, initial x is 9 (since 9 is odd, so no adjustment).\n\nThen in the loop:\n\nsqrt(9) is 3.0.\n\nLoop i from 3 to 3, step 2 \u2192 i=3.\n\nCheck 9 mod 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 found is true.\n\nThus, x becomes 9+2=11.\n\nNow check 11:\n\nsqrt(11) is ~3.316 \u2192 int is 3.\n\nLoop i from 3 to 3 \u2192 3 mod 11 \u2192 11 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 not divisible. So found is false \u2192 exit. So output 11.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the read of output_digits into x must be handled properly. The output_digits is a string like \"22\", so read(output_digits, *) x would work. Alternatively, using '(I)'. But in Fortran, the read statement can be:\n\nread(output_digits, '(I)') x\n\nBut perhaps better to use:\n\nread(output_digits, *) x\n\nBut to avoid issues with leading zeros? Wait, no, because the digits are 0,1,2, so leading zeros are okay. For example, if output_digits is \"002\", then x would be 2, but the code would process it as 2. But according to the second program's logic, leading zeros would be part of the digits. For example, if the second program's output is \"002\", then x is 2, but the code would process it as 2. Wait, but the read statement would read \"002\" as 2. But the third program expects the entire digit string as the number. So \"002\" would be read as 2, but the third program expects 2 as the input. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is a sequence of digits, so \"002\" would be the number 2, but the third program would read it as 2. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the read statement is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: if output_digits is empty (unlikely, but possible if all characters didn't produce any digits). For example, if the input to second program is \"::::\", but that's not possible from first program's output. So assuming the input is valid, the code should work.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
