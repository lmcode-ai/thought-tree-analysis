    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC152_E) reads input N and an array A. It calculates the LCM of all elements using BigInteger, then computes some modular operations, and outputs the result. The second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and outputs the first character plus 1. The third (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, counts character frequencies, and decides \"First\" or \"Second\" based on the number of odd counts.\n\nWait, but the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is from the third.\n\nHmm, but looking at the Java code, the first program's output is a number (ans), which is printed. The second program expects a string input (from the first's output?), but the first outputs a number. Wait, that might be a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But looking at the first Java program, it outputs a number (ans). The second Java program (ABC151_A) reads a string (s = r.readLine()), so the first's output (a number) would be passed as a string to the second. Then the second program takes that string, takes the first character, adds 1 to it (as a char?), and outputs that. Then the third program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string (the output of the second), which is a single character (since the second outputs one character?), and then processes that string.\n\nWait, let me see the second Java program's code. The second program's main is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo it reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that as a character. So if the first program outputs, say, \"123\", then the second program would take the first character '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50 which is '2', and output \"2\". Then the third program would read that \"2\" as a string, process it, and decide \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nIt reads a string (the input from the second program's output, which is a single character like \"2\"), counts the characters. Since it's a single character, the map will have that character once. The oddCount would be 1, so since 1 <=1, it would print \"First\".\n\nSo the entire sequence's output would be \"First\" if the first program's output is a number whose first character is a single digit, etc.\n\nBut the problem is to translate all three into a single Fortran program that does the same steps without I/O in the middle. So the first part (Java1) reads input, then the second (Java2) processes the first's output, then the third (Java3) processes the second's output, and finally outputs the result.\n\nSo in Fortran, the entire process must be done in one program. The first part (Java1's logic) must compute the first output (the ans variable), then pass that to the second part (Java2's logic), which takes that number, converts it to a string, takes the first character, adds 1, then passes that to the third part (Java3's logic), which counts the characters and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program's output is a single character. The third program reads that as a string, which is just that character. So the third program's input is a single character string, so the count is 1 (odd), so the output is \"First\".\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me see the third program's logic:\n\nIn codeforces_276_B, the input is a string. The code counts the frequency of each character. Then, counts how many have odd counts. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, then \"First\", else if it's even, \"Second\".\n\nIf the input is a single character, then the frequency is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1. So 1 <=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\" regardless of the first program's output, as long as the first program's output is a number (so when converted to a string, the first character is a digit, so adding 1 gives another digit, so the third program's input is a single character, leading to \"First\").\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a multi-digit number? Let's say the first program outputs \"1234\". Then the second program takes the first character '1', adds 1 to get '2', outputs \"2\". The third program's input is \"2\", so again \"First\".\n\nAlternatively, if the first program's output is \"A\", then the second program would take 'A' (ASCII 65), add 1 to get 'B', so third program's input is \"B\" \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number (ans is a long, printed as a number). So the first program's output is a number, so when passed to the second program, it's a string of digits. The second program takes the first character (the first digit), adds 1, outputs that as a character. So the third program's input is a single character (the result of that addition). So the third program's input is a single character, so the count is 1 (odd), so the output is \"First\".\n\nWait, so the final output is always \"First\"? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's see the third program's code again. The code is for codeforces problem 276B, which is about a game where players take turns removing characters from a string. The winner is determined based on the parity of the number of characters with odd counts. The actual problem's logic might be different, but according to the code provided, the code's logic is:\n\nThe code counts the number of characters with odd counts. If the number of such characters is 0 or 1, then \"First\" wins. Else, if it's even, \"Second\" wins. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse the condition:\n\nThe condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So:\n\nIf oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 First.\n\nIf oddCount is 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 First.\n\nIf oddCount is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 2%2=0 \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nIf oddCount is 3 \u2192 3 is odd \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, so the code's logic is that if the number of characters with odd counts is even (like 2,4, etc.), then \"Second\" wins. But if it's odd (1,3,5 etc.) or zero, then \"First\".\n\nWait, but in the case of the third program's input being a single character (count 1, so oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf the input is two same characters (count 2 \u2192 even, so oddCount is 0 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, but in the case of input \"aa\", the counts are 2 (even), so oddCount is 0 \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nHmm, but according to the code's condition, when oddCount is 0, it's \"First\".\n\nSo in the scenario where the second program's output is a single character, the third program's input is a single character, so the count is 1 (oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\" regardless of the first program's output, as long as the first program's output is a number (so the second program's input is a string of digits, so first character is a digit, adding 1 gives another digit, so third's input is a single character \u2192 \"First\").\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a negative number? But the problem says the first program is from atcoder ABC152 E, which probably has constraints where the LCM is positive. So the first program's output is a non-negative number, so when printed, it's a string of digits (maybe with a minus sign?), but the second program would take the first character, which could be '-', then adding 1 would give a different character. But in the problem's context, perhaps the first program's output is a positive number, so the first character is a digit.\n\nAssuming that, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the logic. Let me re-examine the code for the third program.\n\nLooking at codeforces_276_B's code:\n\nThe code counts the frequency of each character in the input string. Then, for each entry in the map, if the count is odd, it increments oddCount. Then, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\" else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So:\n\nIf oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 First.\n\nIf oddCount is 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 First.\n\nIf oddCount is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 2%2=0 \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nIf oddCount is 3 \u2192 3 is odd \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the condition is \"if the number of odd counts is even and greater than 1, then Second, else First\".\n\nWait, but the code's condition is written as:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo, for example, if oddCount is 3 (odd), then it's true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf oddCount is 2 (even), then the first part (<=1) is false, and the second part (2 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 not !=0 \u2192 so overall false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nSo the code's logic is that if the number of characters with odd counts is even and greater than 1, then \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nSo in the case of the third program's input being a single character (count 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf the input is two same characters (count 2 \u2192 even \u2192 oddCount=0 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf the input is three different characters each once \u2192 oddCount=3 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf the input is two different characters each once \u2192 oddCount=2 \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nWait, but in the scenario where the second program's output is a single character, the third program's input is a single character, so the count is 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's final output is \"First\" regardless of the first program's output, as long as the first program's output is a number (so the second program's input is a string of digits, leading to a single character output, which the third program processes into \"First\").\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a very long number, like \"1234567890\"? The second program takes the first character '1', adds 1 to get '2', so the third program's input is \"2\" \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is always \"First\".\n\nBut that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the logic of the third program's code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third program's code is different from the problem's actual solution. But according to the code provided, that's how it works.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program must compute the first part (the first Java program's logic), then process it through the second and third steps, and output \"First\".\n\nWait, but the user wants the Fortran program to behave identically to the original chain. So the final output must be exactly what the third Java program would output given the first's output as input.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must compute the first's output, then process it through the second and third steps, and output the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and array A (from first Java program).\n\n2. Compute the LCM of all elements in A, mod 1e9+7, then compute the sum of modLcm divided by each A[i], mod 1e9+7. The first program's output is this sum.\n\n3. Take that sum (as a number), convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, output that as a single character (second program's output).\n\n4. Take that single character (as a string), count the frequency (which is 1), so oddCount is 1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the first program's output is a number. Let me confirm the first program's output.\n\nThe first program's ans is computed as:\n\nans = (ans + modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod)) % mod;\n\nmod is 1e9+7.\n\nmodDiv is modLcm divided by ai mod mod.\n\nWait, modDiv(a, b, mod) is (a * inv(b)) mod mod, where inv is the modular inverse.\n\nSo modLcm is the LCM mod mod. Wait, the LCM is computed as a big integer, then modLcm is LCM mod mod.\n\nWait, but mod is 1e9+7, which is a prime. So the LCM mod mod could be 0 if LCM is a multiple of mod. But mod is 1e9+7, which is a prime, so if any element in A is mod, then LCM would be mod, so modLcm would be 0.\n\nBut in any case, the first program's output is ans mod mod, which is between 0 and mod-1.\n\nSo when printed, it's a number (could be up to 1e9+6, so up to 10 digits). The second program takes the first character of that string, which is the first digit (or '-' if negative, but the problem probably ensures it's positive).\n\nAssuming it's a positive number, the first character is a digit. Adding 1 to its ASCII code gives another digit (e.g., '1' becomes '2'), so the third program's input is a single character, leading to \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is \"0\"? Then the second program takes '0', adds 1 to get '1', so third's input is \"1\" \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf the first program's output is \"9\", then second outputs '10'? Wait no, the second program's code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo if the first character is '9', adding 1 gives 58, which is ':', so the third program's input is a colon. The third program counts the frequency of that character (1), so oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo regardless of the first program's output, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is always \"First\".\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the final Fortran program can just output \"First\" regardless of the input? But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, let me think of a case where the second program's output is more than one character. Suppose the first program's output is \"1234567890\", then the second program's output is '2', so third's input is \"2\" \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs \"A\", then second program's first character is 'A' (ASCII 65), adding 1 gives 'B', so third's input is \"B\" \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so it can't be \"A\". So the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is a string of digits (or maybe with a minus sign, but assuming the problem constraints ensure it's positive).\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's strange. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I misunderstood the sequence of programs.\n\nWait, the user says the three Java programs are executed in sequence, with each output as input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input. The third's output is the final result.\n\nBut according to the code, the third program's output is always \"First\" given the second's output (a single character). So the final output is always \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the first program's logic, then just output \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's a big assumption. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC151_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in), 1);\n        String s;\n        String sl[];\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line (the first program's output, which is a number like \"123\"), then takes the first character (the first digit, '1'), adds 1 to its ASCII value (so '1' becomes '2'), and outputs that as a single character. So the output is a single character string.\n\nThe third program's input is that single character. The third program counts the frequency of each character in the input string. Since it's a single character, the frequency is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1. The condition (oddCount <=1 || oddCount%2 !=0) is true (since 1 is <=1 and also odd), so output is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, regardless of the first program's output, the final result is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to read the input (N and array A), compute the first program's ans, then output \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's a huge simplification. But according to the code provided, that's the case.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute the LCM of all elements in A mod 1e9+7.\n\nCompute the sum over each A[i] of (modLcm * inv(A[i]) mod mod), mod mod.\n\nThen, output \"First\".\n\nBecause the subsequent steps always result in \"First\".\n\nBut I need to confirm that the second and third steps are indeed always leading to \"First\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a case where the first program's output is a negative number, leading to the second program's first character being '-', then adding 1 gives a different character, but the third program's input is still a single character, so oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the first part and then output \"First\".\n\nBut the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So even if the final result is always \"First\", the code must go through all steps.\n\nWait, but the user says \"the final program must behave identically to the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\nSo even if the final output is always \"First\", the code must still compute all steps, but the final output is indeed \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must compute the first part (the LCM and the sum), then process it through the second and third steps, but the final output is \"First\".\n\nWait, but the second step's output is a single character, which is the input to the third step. The third step's output is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute the first program's ans.\n\nConvert ans to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, then process that as the input to the third step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the first program's output (ans).\n\n2. Convert ans to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, then that is the input to the third program.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is that single character. The third program's code counts the characters, so the output is \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute ans as per first program.\n\nThen, compute the first character of the string representation of ans, add 1, then process that as the input to the third step's logic.\n\nBut the third step's logic is to count the characters in the input string (which is the single character from step 2), so the count is 1 \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can just output \"First\" after computing the first part, but must go through the steps.\n\nWait, but the user requires that the intermediate steps are done without I/O. So the first part reads input, then the second and third steps are done in memory, and the final output is produced.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n- Read N and array A.\n\n- Compute the LCM mod 1e9+7.\n\n- Compute the sum mod 1e9+7 (ans).\n\n- Convert ans to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII value (as a character).\n\n- Then, process that character as the input to the third step's logic (counting frequencies).\n\n- The third step's logic will output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute the first part's ans.\n\nThen, process the ans into a string, take first character, add 1, then count the frequency (which is 1), then decide \"First\".\n\nSo the code can be written without needing to actually process the string steps, since the result is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but perhaps the first program's output could be a multi-digit number, but the second step's processing is just taking the first character and adding 1, so the third step's input is a single character, leading to \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the first part, then output \"First\".\n\nBut the user might expect that the code must go through all steps, even if the result is always the same. So perhaps I should code all steps, but the final output is \"First\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where the first program's output is a negative number, leading to the second step's first character being '-', then adding 1 gives a different character, but the third step still outputs \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFirst, compute the first part's ans.\n\nThen, convert ans to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value (as a character).\n\nThen, count the frequency of each character in that single-character string (which is 1), so oddCount is 1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n    integer(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n    integer(8) :: lcm_val, ans, modLcm\n    character(len=20) :: ans_str\n    character :: c\n    integer :: oddCount = 0\n\n    !

Since the input is a single character, the frequency is 1, so oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the code will always print \"First\".\n\nBut the code must handle the case where the ans is negative? Well, the first program's ans is mod mod_val (1e9+7), so it's between 0 and 1e9+6, so non-negative. So the string conversion is okay.\n\nThe LCM computation must be done correctly. The LCM function uses the GCD function. The GCD function here is written as a separate function.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the LCM is computed using BigInteger's GCD. The Fortran code's LCM function is a(8) * b(8) / GCD(a,b). But since a and b can be large, but in the problem's constraints, perhaps the LCM can be computed without overflow? Or maybe the problem's constraints ensure that the LCM mod mod_val is sufficient, but the LCM itself can be very large. Wait, but in the first Java program, the LCM is computed as a big integer, then modLcm is LCM mod mod_val. So in Fortran, the LCM computation must be done as integers, but since LCM can be very large (product of numbers up to 1e9?), but in the problem's constraints, perhaps N is small enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM can be computed modulo mod_val? But no, because the modDiv function requires the LCM mod mod_val divided by each A[i], but the division requires the modular inverse of A[i], which must be coprime with mod_val (which is prime). Since mod_val is 1e9+7 (a prime), the inverse exists only if A[i] is not a multiple of mod_val. But since mod_val is 1e9+7, and the problem's input A[i] is probably within reasonable limits (like up to 1e9), so A[i] mod mod_val is non-zero, so inverse exists.\n\nWait, but the LCM computation in the first Java program is done with big integers, so the actual LCM can be very large, but modLcm is LCM mod mod_val. So in Fortran, to compute LCM, we can compute it step by step, using the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). But for large numbers, this might overflow. However, since we only need LCM mod mod_val, perhaps we can compute it modulo mod_val? But that's not correct because LCM(a,b) mod mod_val is not equal to (a mod mod_val * b mod mod_val / GCD(a mod mod_val, b mod mod_val)) mod mod_val. Hmm, so perhaps the LCM must be computed exactly, but in Fortran with 8-byte integers (64-bit), which can handle up to ~1e18. So if the LCM exceeds that, it would overflow. But given that mod_val is 1e9+7, and the problem's constraints (probably N up to 1e5?), but the LCM could be huge. Wait, but in the first Java program, the LCM is computed as a big integer, so it can handle arbitrarily large numbers. But in Fortran, using 64-bit integers may not be sufficient for large LCMs. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, this is a critical point. The LCM computation in the first Java program uses big integers, so it can handle very large LCMs. However, in Fortran, using 8-byte integers (which are 64-bit, so up to 2^63-1 ~ 9e18), the LCM could exceed that if the numbers are large enough. For example, if N is 20 and each A[i] is a prime number, the LCM would be the product of all primes, which could exceed 64-bit.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code may not be able to compute the LCM correctly for large inputs, leading to incorrect results. But the problem requires that the Fortran program behaves identically to the original Java sequence. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the final program must behave identically to the original chain when run on the same input\". So if the input is such that the LCM exceeds 64-bit integers, the Fortran code would fail, but the Java code would handle it. Therefore, the code must compute the LCM correctly even for large values.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How can I compute the LCM in Fortran without using big integers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod_val is sufficient? Let me think.\n\nThe modLcm is LCM mod mod_val. The first program computes modLcm as LCM mod mod_val. Then, the modDiv function is modLcm divided by A[i], mod mod_val. But division here is modular inverse.\n\nWait, the modDiv function is (modLcm * inv(A[i])) mod mod_val.\n\nBut modLcm is LCM mod mod_val. So the division is ( (LCM mod mod_val) * inv(A[i]) ) mod mod_val.\n\nBut LCM is a multiple of A[i], so LCM/A[i] is an integer. Therefore, (LCM mod mod_val) * inv(A[i]) mod mod_val is equal to (LCM/A[i]) mod mod_val.\n\nTherefore, even if LCM is very large, as long as we can compute LCM mod mod_val, we can proceed.\n\nWait, but how to compute LCM mod mod_val?\n\nWait, the LCM of the array A mod mod_val can be computed incrementally. Let me think:\n\nThe LCM of a list of numbers mod mod_val can be computed as follows:\n\nInitialize current_lcm = 1 mod mod_val.\n\nFor each a in A:\n\n    current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\nBut mod mod_val?\n\nWait, but this is the standard LCM computation. However, when modding by mod_val, perhaps we can compute it as:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\nBut mod mod_val?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the division by gcd may not be exact modulo mod_val. Hmm, perhaps this approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, since mod_val is a prime (1e9+7 is a prime?), perhaps we can compute the LCM mod mod_val as follows:\n\nThe LCM mod mod_val is equal to the product of all primes in the prime factorization of the LCM, each raised to the power of their maximum exponent in the array elements, mod mod_val.\n\nBut this requires factorizing each A[i], which is computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod_val can be computed as the product of all A[i] divided by the product of their GCDs, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod_val can be computed step by step, but using the formula:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\nBut mod mod_val?\n\nWait, but the division here is exact because current_lcm and a are multiples of their GCD. So the division is an integer. Therefore, the LCM can be computed step by step, and mod mod_val at each step.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose current_lcm is the LCM of the first k elements mod mod_val.\n\nWait, no, because modding at each step would lose information. For example, suppose mod_val is 5, and the first element is 3, second is 4.\n\nThe LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. mod 5 is 2.\n\nBut if we compute step by step:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\ncurrent_lcm = LCM(1,3) = 3 mod 5 \u2192 3.\n\nThen LCM(3,4) = 12 mod5 \u2192 2.\n\nBut if we compute LCM(3 mod5,4 mod5):\n\ncurrent_lcm = 3 mod5.\n\nThen next step:\n\ngcd(3,4) = 1.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (3 *4)/1 = 12 mod5 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: elements 5 and 3, mod_val=5.\n\nThe LCM of 5 and 3 is 15 mod5 is 0.\n\nBut if we compute step by step:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nAfter first element 5: LCM(1,5)=5 mod5 \u21920.\n\nThen next element 3:\n\ngcd(0,3) is 3.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (0 *3)/3 =0 mod5 \u21920. Correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the LCM mod mod_val can be computed step by step as:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\nmod mod_val.\n\nWait, but in code, since we are working mod mod_val, but the division is exact.\n\nWait, but in code, when we compute current_lcm * a, it can be very large, but since we are modding by mod_val, perhaps we can compute it as:\n\ncurrent_lcm = mod( (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a), mod_val )\n\nBut division in integers is tricky. However, since (current_lcm * a) is divisible by gcd(current_lcm, a), the division is exact.\n\nTherefore, the LCM mod mod_val can be computed step by step using this formula, even with mod_val.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can compute the LCM mod mod_val as follows:\n\nInitialize current_lcm = 1 mod mod_val.\n\nFor each a in A:\n\n    current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n    current_lcm = mod(current_lcm, mod_val)\n\nWait, but this is not exactly correct because the division is exact, but when modded by mod_val, the division may not be exact. Wait, no, because the division is exact before modding.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nSuppose current_lcm is the LCM of previous elements mod mod_val.\n\nWait, no, the current_lcm is actually the LCM mod mod_val. But when we multiply by a, then divide by the GCD, the result is the new LCM mod mod_val?\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nWait, let's see with the first example where mod_val is 5, elements 3 and 4:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst element 3:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (1 *3)/gcd(1,3)=3/1=3 mod5 \u21923.\n\nSecond element 4:\n\ngcd(3,4)=1.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (3*4)/1 =12 mod5 \u21922. Correct.\n\nAnother example with elements 5 and 3 mod5=5:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst element 5:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (1*5)/gcd(1,5)=5 mod5 \u21920.\n\nSecond element 3:\n\ngcd(0,3)=3.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (0 *3)/3 =0 mod5 \u21920. Correct.\n\nAnother example: elements 2 and 3 mod5.\n\ncurrent_lcm after first element 2 is 2.\n\nSecond element 3:\n\ngcd(2,3)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = (2*3)/1 =6 mod5 \u21921. Which is LCM(2,3)=6 mod5=1. Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the LCM mod mod_val can be computed step by step using this method, even with mod_val.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can compute modLcm as follows:\n\nInitialize modLcm = 1 mod mod_val.\n\nLoop over each a in A:\n\n    compute the GCD of modLcm and a.\n\n    modLcm = (modLcm * a) / gcd_val\n\n    modLcm = mod(modLcm, mod_val)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we need to ensure that (modLcm * a) is divisible by gcd_val.\n\nYes, because modLcm and a have a GCD of gcd_val, so modLcm = gcd_val * m, a = gcd_val * n, where m and n are coprime. So modLcm * a = gcd_val^2 * m*n. Divided by gcd_val gives gcd_val * m*n, which is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact.\n\nTherefore, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the LCM mod mod_val can be computed without needing to compute the actual LCM, which avoids overflow.\n\nThis is a crucial insight. Therefore, the LCM mod mod_val can be computed step by step using the formula above.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the LCM computation can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize modLcm = 1 mod mod_val.\n\nThen for each a in A:\n\n    compute the GCD of modLcm and a.\n\n    modLcm = (modLcm * a) / gcd_val\n\n    modLcm = mod(modLcm, mod_val)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables are of fixed size. So modLcm must be an integer(8) (64-bit), but even then, multiplying modLcm (which can be up to mod_val-1) by a (up to 1e9) could exceed 64 bits?\n\nWait, mod_val is 1e9+7, so modLcm can be up to 1e9+6. a can be up to 1e9 (assuming problem constraints). So modLcm * a can be up to (1e9+6)*(1e9) ~ 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer (max 9e18). So it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute modLcm as per above.\n\nCompute ans as the sum over each A[i] of modDiv(modLcm, A[i], mod_val), mod mod_val.\n\nThen, process the ans into a string, take first character, add 1, then process that as input to the third step.\n\nThe third step's logic is to count the frequency of each character in the input string (which is a single character), so the count is 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, implementing the LCM mod mod_val:\n\nIn the code:\n\nmodLcm is initialized to 1.\n\nLoop over each element in A:\n\n    current a is A(i)\n\n    compute gcd_val = gcd(modLcm, a)\n\n    modLcm = (modLcm * a) / gcd_val\n\n    modLcm = mod(modLcm, mod_val)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division must be integer division. Since (modLcm * a) is divisible by gcd_val, the division is exact.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the modDiv function:\n\nmodDiv(a, b, mod_val) is (a * modInv(b, mod_val)) mod mod_val.\n\nmodInv is the modular inverse of b mod mod_val.\n\nmodInv is computed via Fermat's little theorem since mod_val is prime.\n\nmodInv(b) = b^(mod_val-2) mod mod_val.\n\nThe modPow function is as in the Java code.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute modLcm:\n\nmodLcm = 1\n\ndo i = 1 to N:\n\n    a = A(i)\n\n    gcd_val = gcd(modLcm, a)\n\n    modLcm = (modLcm * a) / gcd_val\n\n    modLcm = mod(modLcm, mod_val)\n\nend do\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1 to N:\n\n    a = A(i)\n\n    term = modDiv(modLcm, a, mod_val)\n\n    ans = mod(ans + term, mod_val)\n\nend do\n\nThen process the ans into a string, take first character, add 1, then process that as input to the third step.\n\nThe third step's logic is to count the frequency of each character in the input string (which is a single character), so the count is 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed to output \"First\".\n\nBut to be precise, the code must process the string steps.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nConvert ans to a string:\n\nwrite(ans_str, '(I0)') ans\n\nc = ans_str(1:1)\n\nc = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\nThen, the input to the third step is the string containing c.\n\nThe third step's logic is to count the frequency of each character in this string.\n\nSince it's a single character, the frequency is 1 \u2192 oddCount =1.\n\nThus, the code can directly set oddCount =1 and proceed.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n    integer(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n    integer(8) :: modLcm, ans\n    character(len=20) :: ans_str\n    character :: c\n    integer :: oddCount = 0\n\n    !

Compute ans\n    ans = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        ans = mod(ans + modDiv(modLcm, A(i), mod_val), mod_val)\n    end do\n\n    ! Process second step\n    write(ans_str, '(I0)') ans\n    c = ans_str(1:1)\n    c = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\n    ! Third step: count frequency of characters in c (single character)\n    oddCount = 1  ! since count is 1 (odd)\n    if (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n        print*, 'First'\n    else\n        print*, 'Second'\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    integer(8) function modDiv(a, b, mod_val)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b, mod_val\n        modDiv = mod(a * modInv(b, mod_val), mod_val)\n    end function\n\n    integer(8) function modInv(x, mod_val)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: x, mod_val\n        modInv = modPow(x, mod_val-2, mod_val)\n    end function\n\n    integer(8) function modPow(b, e, mod_val)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: b, e, mod_val\n        integer(8) :: ans = 1, x = mod(b, mod_val)\n        integer(8) :: y = e\n        do while (y > 0)\n            if (btest(y,0)) then\n                ans = mod(ans * x, mod_val)\n            end if\n            x = mod(x * x, mod_val)\n            y = rshift(y,1)\n        end do\n        modPow = ans\n    end function\n\n    integer(8) function gcd(a, b)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n        integer(8) :: temp\n        gcd = a\n        do while (b /= 0)\n            temp = mod(gcd, b)\n            gcd = b\n            b = temp\n        end do\n    end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the LCM computation loop:\n\nmodLcm = mod(modLcm * A(i) / gcd(modLcm, A(i)), mod_val)\n\nBut in Fortran, the order of operations matters. The division must be done after multiplication, but since it's integer division, the expression is evaluated as (modLcm * A(i)) divided by gcd_val, then mod mod_val.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs:\n\nSuppose N=1, A=[2].\n\nThen modLcm is 2 mod 1e9+7 \u21922.\n\nans is modDiv(2,2, mod_val) \u2192 (2 * inv(2)) mod mod_val.\n\ninv(2) is 500000004 (since 2*500000004 mod 1e9+7 is 1).\n\nSo modDiv(2,2) is 1.\n\nans =1 mod mod_val \u21921.\n\nSecond step: ans_str is \"1\", first character '1' \u2192 add 1 \u2192 '2'.\n\nThird step: count is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother test case: N=2, A=[2,3].\n\nmodLcm is LCM(2,3)=6 mod mod_val \u21926.\n\nans is modDiv(6,2) + modDiv(6,3).\n\nmodDiv(6,2) = (6 * inv(2)) mod mod_val \u2192 3 * 500000004 mod mod_val \u21923*500000004 mod mod_val is 1500000012 mod mod_val \u21921500000012 - 1e9+7 = 500000005 \u2192 but mod_val is 1e9+7, so 1500000012 mod mod_val is 500000005?\n\nWait, 1e9+7 is 1000000007.\n\n6 * inv(2) mod mod_val is 3 mod mod_val \u21923.\n\nmodDiv(6,3) is 2 mod mod_val \u21922.\n\nSo ans =3+2=5 mod mod_val \u21925.\n\nSecond step: ans_str is \"5\" \u2192 first character '5' \u2192 add 1 \u2192 '6'.\n\nThird step: count is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nThe final output is always \"First\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program is as above."
