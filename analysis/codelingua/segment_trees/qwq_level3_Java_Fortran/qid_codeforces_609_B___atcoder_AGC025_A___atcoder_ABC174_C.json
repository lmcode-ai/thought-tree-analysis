    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_609_B) reads two integers n and m, then an array of n integers. It counts the occurrences of each number from 1 to m in the array using a frequency array gen. Then it calculates the sum of products of gen[i] and gen[k] for all i != k, and divides by 2. The output is this ans/2.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A where A ranges up to N/2 or (N+1)/2. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1), then it loops through A from 1 to n (the midpoint) and finds the minimum sum.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K, checks if it's even or divisible by 5, returns -1 in that case. If divisible by 7, divides by 7. Then multiplies by 9, and finds the smallest ans where 10^ans mod (K) == 1 mod K. The problem is to find the minimal length of a number consisting of all 1's divisible by K, but with some conditions.\n\nNow, the key is to chain these three programs. The output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third. So the first program's output is a number, which is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. The final output is the third's result.\n\nWait, but how exactly do the outputs and inputs connect? Let me check each program's input and output:\n\nFirst program's output is a single integer (ans/2). That's the input for the second program, which expects N as input. So the second program's input is the first's output. Then the second's output is an integer, which is the input for the third program's K. The third program's output is the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nRead n, m, then n integers into an array. Count frequencies in gen(1 to m). Then compute the sum over i and k (i !=k) of gen(i)*gen(k), then divide by 2.\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they start at 0. The gen array in Java is size 11, but actually, since the loop is for i from 0 to n-1, and arr[i] is between 1 and m (assuming the input numbers are in that range?), so gen is initialized as 11 elements, but maybe m can be up to 10? Because the problem might have constraints. Wait, the code uses gen from 0 to 10? Wait, in the code, the for loop for the array is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    arr[i] = in.nextInt();\n    gen[arr[i]]++;\n}\n\nSo arr[i] can be up to m, since m is the second input. So the gen array in Java is size 11, but if m is larger than 10, then this would cause an error. Wait, but the code might have a mistake here. Wait, the problem's constraints must have m up to 10, perhaps? Because otherwise the code would have an array out of bounds. Looking at the problem's code, the first Java program's gen is declared as int[11], so indices 0-10. So the input numbers must be between 1 and m, but m must be <=10. Because otherwise, if m is 11, then arr[i] could be 11, which would be out of the array's bounds. So the problem's constraints must have m <=10. So in the code, the gen array is okay.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the first part will need to read n and m, then n integers. Then create an array gen(0:10) (since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran arrays can be 0-based if declared as 0:10). Wait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but you can specify the lower bound. So perhaps declare gen(0:10).\n\nThen, for each number in the array, increment gen(arr(i)).\n\nThen compute the sum. The loops are for i from 1 to m, and k from 1 to m, and if i !=k, add gen(i)*gen(k). Then divide by 2. The division by 2 is because each pair is counted twice (i,k and k,i). So the total sum is sum_{i !=k} gen[i] * gen[k] = (sum(gen)^2 - sum(gen[i]^2)) ) but the code's way is O(m^2), which is okay for m up to 10.\n\nSo the first part's output is (sum over i and k (i !=k) gen[i] * gen[k]) / 2.\n\nNow, the second program takes that output as N. So the first program's output is N for the second program.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nIt takes N, computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A, where A ranges from 1 to n (n is N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2). The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then loops A from 1 to n, and checks if the sum of digits of A plus sum of digits of (N-A) is less than current ans, updates ans.\n\nThe function sum(a) adds the digits of a until it's less than 10. Wait, no, the function sum(a) is:\n\nint ans =0; while a >=10, add a%10 to ans, then a /=10. Then add the remaining a. So it's the sum of all digits of a. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the code for sum(a):\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nLoop while a >=10:\n\nans += a%10\n\na = a /10\n\nThen after loop, add a to ans.\n\nSo for example, a= 123:\n\nLoop runs when a is 123 (>=10):\n\nans +=3, a becomes 12.\n\nThen again, a=12: ans +=2, a becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends since a is 1 <10.\n\nThen add 1 to ans: total 3+2+1=6.\n\nSo the function sum(a) is the sum of all digits of a. So the function is correct.\n\nThe second program's output is the minimal sum of digits of A and (N-A) for A up to n.\n\nThe third program's input is the second's output, which is an integer. Let's call that K.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nRead K. If K is even or divisible by 5, output -1. Else, if divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9, then find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod (new K) == 1 mod K. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nThen, find the smallest ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1 mod K. Wait, the code is:\n\nremainder starts at 10 mod K. Then, while remainder !=1, multiply by 10 mod K each time, increment ans. So the loop is:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nremainder = 10 mod K.\n\nif remainder is 1, then ans is 1.\n\nElse, loop:\n\nans increments, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nuntil remainder is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal ans where 10^ans \u2261 1 mod (K). The code is finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, but only if K is co-prime with 10. Because if K has factors 2 or 5, then 10 and K are not coprime, so the multiplicative order doesn't exist, hence return -1.\n\nWait, but the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. So that's correct.\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Wait, why?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code's K is modified as follows:\n\nIf K mod7 ==0, then K = K/7. Then K *=9.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires some specific steps. Let me think about the problem's original context. The third program is from atcoder ABC174_C. The problem might be to find the minimal length of a number consisting of all 1's divisible by K. But the code's logic is a bit different. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe code's solve function:\n\nRead K. If K is even or divisible by 5, return -1.\n\nIf K mod7 ==0, then K = K/7.\n\nThen K *=9.\n\nThen find the minimal ans where (10^ans -1)/9 mod K ==0 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal L such that the number consisting of L 1's is divisible by K. The number with L 1's is (10^L -1)/9. So (10^L -1)/9 mod K ==0 \u2192 10^L \u22611 mod (9*K). Wait, but the code's approach is different. Let me see:\n\nThe code's K is modified as follows:\n\nAfter dividing by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9. So the new K is (K/7)*9 if divisible by 7, else K*9?\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9.\n\nSo the new K is (original K divided by 7 if divisible by 7) multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that K must not have factors 2 or 5, which is handled by the first condition. Then, the code is trying to find the minimal L where 10^L \u22611 mod (new K). Because (10^L -1)/9 mod (original K) must be 0 \u2192 10^L \u22611 mod (9*K) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the minimal L such that 10^L \u22611 mod (K'), where K' is K multiplied by 9 (after dividing by 7 if needed). Not sure, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nAnyway, the code's steps are:\n\n- Check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\n- If divisible by 7, divide by 7.\n\n- Multiply by 9 \u2192 new K is (K /7)*9 (if divisible by 7) else K*9.\n\n- Then find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod (new K) ==1 mod (new K).\n\nWait, but the code's K is modified in place. So after dividing by 7 (if needed), multiply by 9, then the remainder is computed modulo this new K.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nremainder = 10 mod K (the new K).\n\nThen while remainder !=1:\n\nans +=1\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans is the minimal exponent where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nThus, the code is finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo the new K. But only if the new K and 10 are coprime. Since the original K is not divisible by 2 or 5, and after dividing by 7 (if needed), then multiplied by 9 (which is 3^2), so the new K is (original K /7)*9. Since original K is not divisible by 2 or 5, the new K is also not divisible by 2 or 5. So 10 and new K are coprime? Let's see:\n\nThe new K is (K /7)*9. Since original K is not divisible by 2 or 5, and 7 is prime, so the new K's factors are (original factors except 7) multiplied by 9. Since 9 is 3^2, so the new K's factors are 3^2 and whatever was in original K (excluding 7, 2,5). So 10 and new K are coprime only if new K has no factors of 2 or 5, which it doesn't. So the multiplicative order exists.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct for the problem.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m, then n integers. Compute the first program's output (ans1).\n\nThen, use ans1 as N for the second program, compute ans2.\n\nThen, use ans2 as K for the third program, compute ans3, which is the final output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, then n integers.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (ans1).\n\n3. Compute the second part's result (ans2) using ans1 as N.\n\n4. Compute the third part's result (ans3) using ans2 as K.\n\n5. Output ans3.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nVariables:\n\nn, m: integers.\n\narr: array of n integers.\n\ngen: array of 11 integers (indices 0 to 10).\n\nans1: the first program's output.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead n, m, then n integers into arr.\n\nInitialize gen(0:10) to 0.\n\nLoop over each element in arr, increment gen(arr(i)).\n\nThen compute the sum:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, m\n\n   do k = 1, m\n\n      if (i /= k) then\n\n         ans = ans + gen(i)*gen(k)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nans1 = ans / 2\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but if ans is even, then it's okay. Since in Java, the division is integer division (since ans is a long, but the variables are integers). The code in Java does (long) gen[i] * gen[k], but in Fortran, integers can be large enough.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the ans is a long, so the sum can be up to (m^2)*(n^2). Since m is up to 10, n can be up to, say, 1e5? But in the problem's constraints, perhaps n is manageable. Anyway, in Fortran, using integers should be okay unless the numbers get too big. But for the problem's purposes, let's proceed.\n\nSecond part:\n\nGiven N = ans1, compute ans2.\n\nFunction sum_digits(a) which returns the sum of digits of a.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be written as subroutines or functions. Let's make a function sum_digits.\n\nFunction sum_digits(a) result(res)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: res, temp\n\nres = 0\n\ntemp = a\n\ndo while (temp >=10)\n\n   res = res + mod(temp,10)\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nres = res + temp\n\nend function\n\nThen, in the second part:\n\nN = ans1\n\nif (mod(N,2) ==0) then\n\n   n_val = N/2\n\nelse\n\n   n_val = (N+1)/2\n\nend if\n\nans2 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\ndo A = 1, n_val\n\n   current = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current < ans2) then\n\n      ans2 = current\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThird part:\n\nGiven K = ans2, compute ans3.\n\nFirst, check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, ans3 = -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nThen find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1 mod K.\n\nWait, but how to compute this in Fortran.\n\nInitialize ans =1\n\nremainder = mod(10, K)\n\ndo while (remainder /=1)\n\n   ans = ans +1\n\n   remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nend do\n\nans3 = ans\n\nBut need to handle the case where K is 1? Let's see:\n\nIf K is 1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, but 10^1 mod1 is 0, but 1 mod1 is 0. Wait, but the loop condition is remainder !=1. So if K is 1, then remainder is 0, so the loop continues. Wait, but 10 mod1 is 0. So the loop would run until ans increases until remainder becomes 1 mod1, which is 0. So that's a problem. Wait, but K is 1, then 10^ans mod1 is 0, but 1 mod1 is 0. So the condition is remainder ==1 mod K (which is 1 mod1 is 0). So the loop would never end. Hmm, but in the problem's constraints, perhaps K can't be 1 here?\n\nWait, let's see the third program's code. The third program's input is the second's output, which is the minimal digit sum. The second program's output is at least 1 (since for N=1, the minimal sum is 1+0? Wait, let's see for N=1:\n\nWait N=1, then the second program's N is 1. Then n_val would be (1+1)/2 =1. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0). Wait, but sum(0) is 0? Let me see:\n\nWait in the second program's code, the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). For N=1, N-1 is 0. The sum function for 0: the code in Java would have a=0. The loop while a >=10 is skipped, then add a (0) to ans (0). So sum(0) is 0. So initial ans is sum(1) (1) + sum(0) (0) \u2192 1. Then the loop runs A from 1 to 1 (since n_val is 1). For A=1, N-A is 0. sum(1) + sum(0) is 1 again. So the ans remains 1. So the output is 1. So K would be 1. Then in the third program, K=1.\n\nThen in the third program's code:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 no. Then check if divisible by7 \u2192 no. Multiply by9 \u2192 K becomes 9.\n\nThen find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1 mod9.\n\n10 mod9 is 1. So remainder is 1. So ans is 1. So the code would return 1. So the loop would not run, since remainder is 1 initially. So the code works.\n\nSo in the case K=1, the third program's code would process it correctly.\n\nBack to the code in Fortran:\n\nSo the steps for the third part:\n\nFirst, check if mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0 \u2192 if yes, ans3 =-1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nThen compute the minimal ans.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables are typed. So K must be an integer. Let's see:\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\nIn the third part:\n\nK_in = ans2\n\nif (mod(K_in,2) ==0 .or. mod(K_in,5) ==0) then\n\n   ans3 = -1\n\nelse\n\n   K = K_in\n\n   if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n      K = K /7\n\n   end if\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   ans =1\n\n   remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n   if (remainder ==1) then\n\n      ans3 = ans\n\n   else\n\n      do while (remainder /=1)\n\n         ans = ans +1\n\n         remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n      end do\n\n      ans3 = ans\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program must read the initial input (n, m, then n integers), compute ans1, then ans2, then ans3, then print ans3.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nWe need to declare variables for all steps.\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, arr(n), gen(0:10), ans1\n\nSecond part variables:\n\ninteger :: N, n_val, ans2, A, current\n\nThird part variables:\n\ninteger :: K_in, K, ans3, remainder, temp\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays must have fixed sizes. The first part's arr is of size n, which is read from input. So in Fortran, we can't have an array of size n unless we use allocatable arrays.\n\nAh, right. So in Fortran, to handle variable-sized arrays, we need to read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nRead n and m first.\n\nThen allocate the array arr(n).\n\nThen read the n integers into arr.\n\nProceed with the first part's computation.\n\nThus, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, ans1, ans2, ans3\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\ninteger :: gen(0:10)\n\n!

So that's okay.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\nIn the first part, the array arr is read as n integers. The gen array is 0:10, so if any element in arr is greater than m, but according to the problem's constraints, the input numbers are between 1 and m. So the code is okay.\n\nIn the second part, the loop for A runs from 1 to n_val. The function sum_digits is correctly implemented.\n\nIn the third part, the variables are properly declared. The loop for finding the remainder is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\nn=3, m=2, arr = [1,1,2]\n\nThen gen[1] =2, gen[2]=1.\n\nThe sum over i and k (i !=k):\n\ni=1, k=2 \u2192 2*1 =2\n\ni=2, k=1 \u21921*2=2\n\nTotal sum is 4 \u2192 ans1 =4/2=2.\n\nSecond program's N=2.\n\nCompute the minimal sum.\n\nN=2, n_val is 1.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1)+sum(1) \u21921+1=2.\n\nLoop A=1:\n\nsum(1) + sum(1) \u21922 \u2192 same as initial. So ans2 remains 2.\n\nThird program's K=2.\n\nCheck if K is even \u2192 yes. So ans3 is -1.\n\nThus, the final output is -1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\nn=2, m=3, arr = [1,3]\n\ngen[1]=1, gen[3]=1, others 0.\n\nsum over i and k (i !=k):\n\ni=1 and k=2 (but m=3, so k can be 1,2,3. Wait, m=3, so i and k go from 1 to 3.\n\nWait, for m=3, the loops are i from 1 to 3, k from 1 to 3.\n\nThe pairs where i !=k:\n\ni=1, k=2 \u2192 gen[1]*gen[2] =1*0=0\n\ni=1, k=3 \u21921*1=1\n\ni=2, k=1 \u21920*1=0\n\ni=2, k=3 \u21920*1=0\n\ni=3, k=1 \u21921*1=1\n\ni=3, k=2 \u21921*0=0\n\nTotal sum is 1+1 =2 \u2192 ans1=1.\n\nSecond program's N=1.\n\nAs before, the output is 1.\n\nThird program's K=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nK is 1, not even or divisible by5.\n\nCheck mod(1,7) \u21921, so no division.\n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nNow find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1 mod9.\n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1. So ans=1.\n\nThus, the final output is 1.\n\nSo the code should output 1.\n\nAnother test case for third part:\n\nSuppose K_in is 7.\n\nThen K_in is 7, which is not even or divisible by5.\n\nCheck mod(7,7)=0 \u2192 divide by7 \u2192 K becomes 1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nSame as before, so ans3 is 1.\n\nAnother case where K_in is 3.\n\nThen K_in is 3 \u2192 not even or divisible by5.\n\nNo division by7 (3 mod7\u22600). Multiply by9 \u2192 K=27.\n\nLooking for 10^ans mod27 ==1.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n10 mod27 \u219210\n\n10^2 mod27 \u2192100 mod27 \u2192100-3*27=100-81=19 \u219219\n\n10^3 mod27 \u2192190 mod27 \u2192190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 so ans=3.\n\nThus, the code would return 3.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the code, when K=27:\n\nans starts at1, remainder=10 mod27=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nremainder !=1 \u2192 ans becomes 2, remainder=10*10 mod27=100 mod27=19.\n\nans=2, remainder=19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 remainder=19*10 mod27 \u2192190 mod27=1 \u2192 yes. So loop exits, ans3=3.\n\nThus correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code as written above should work."
