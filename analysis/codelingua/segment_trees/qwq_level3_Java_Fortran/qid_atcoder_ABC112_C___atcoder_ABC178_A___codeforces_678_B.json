    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC112_C) reads input from stdin. It takes N points with x, y, h values. Then it loops over possible coordinates (i,j) up to MAX (100) and checks if there's a valid \"center\" (cx, cy) such that the height h[i] can be derived from the Manhattan distance from (cx,cy) plus the center's height. The check function computes the center height and verifies all points. The output is the first valid (cx, cy, ch).\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x (0 or 1) and outputs the opposite. So if x is 1, output 0; else 1.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_678_B) takes a year and finds the next year where the total days from the input year to that year modulo 7 is 0, and the leap status of the next year must be the same as the input year's leap status. Wait, no, looking at the code again: the condition is that (sum %7 ==0) and that the leap status of the current i (the next year) must be the same as the original year's leap status. Wait, the original leap is for the input year y. The code checks for each i starting from y+1, and when sum mod7 is 0, it checks if the leap status of i is same as the original y's leap status. If so, print i and exit.\n\nSo the sequence is: first program's output is the input to the second, then second's output to third, then third's output is the final result.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? The first program's output is three numbers (cx cy ch). The second program expects an integer x (probably the first number?), but the second program's input is a single integer. Wait, the second program's input is a single integer x. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first number (i?), then the second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program? Or maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first number as input, then the third takes the second program's output?\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is three numbers. The second program expects a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first number (the first integer in the output line) as its input. Then the second program's output is a single integer, which is the input to the third program. The third program takes that integer as its input (the x from the second's output) and processes it.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a year. The second program's output is 0 or 1, which is a number between 0 and 1. That can't be a year. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a line with three integers: i j ch. The second program expects an integer x (from System.in). So the second program would read the first integer from the first program's output. The second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a year (an integer, but likely a 4-digit number). So this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program only reads the first number (i?), then the second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a year, which is a much larger number. That can't be right. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first number as input, then the second program's output is a single number (0 or 1), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a year, which is a 4-digit number. So this would not make sense. Therefore, perhaps the sequence is not as I thought. Maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program is not taking that as input. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which must read that entire output. But the second program expects a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. The second program's output is then a single integer, which is the input to the third program. The third program expects a year, but the second's output is 0 or 1, which is not a valid year. So this suggests that perhaps the sequence is not correct, but maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the three Java files are meant to be run in sequence, but each subsequent program uses the previous's output as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output. But the problem is that the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program expects a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program only reads the first number (the first integer in the output line). The second program's output is then a single integer (0 or 1), which is the input to the third program. But the third program expects a year (like 2010 or something), but the second's output is 0 or 1, which is not a valid year. That's a problem. So maybe there's a mistake here, but perhaps the problem is correct and I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the third number (ch) as input? Let me check the second program's code again. The second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC178_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n        boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n        int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n        out.println(result);\n        out.flush();\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads an integer x, then inverts it (so 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0). So the input to this program is a single integer. The first program's output is three integers. So the second program must read the first integer from the first program's output. The second program's output is then 0 or 1, which is the input to the third program. The third program's code is:\n\npublic class codeforces_678_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int y = in.nextInt();\n        boolean leap = check_leap(y);\n        int sum = 0;\n        int mod = 0;\n        for (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n            if (check_leap(i)) {\n                sum += 366;\n            } else {\n                sum += 365;\n            }\n            if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                    System.out.println(i);\n                    return;\n                } else {\n                    continue;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static boolean check_leap(int y) {\n        return y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n    }\n}\n\nSo the third program takes a year y as input. The second program's output is 0 or 1, which is passed as the input to the third program. But 0 or 1 as a year is invalid. So this suggests that perhaps the sequence is not as I thought. Maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the third number (ch) as input? Let me see: the first program's output is \"i j ch\", so the third number is ch. If ch is 0 or 1, then the second program would process it. But in the first program, ch is the height of the center, which could be any positive integer. So that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program is only taking the first number (i) as input. But then the third program would get 0 or 1 as the input year, which is invalid. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the problem's setup is different. Wait, perhaps the three Java files are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user provided three separate programs, and the task is to translate each into Fortran, but the user's instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, with each subsequent program taking the previous's output as input. But the problem is that the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program expects a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. The second program's output is then 0 or 1, which is the input to the third program. But the third program expects a year, which is a 4-digit number. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the third number (ch) as input. Let me see: the first program's check function returns ch which is the center's height. The first program's output is i j ch. So ch is the height. So if ch is 0 or 1, then the second program can process it. But in the first program, the check function returns ch only if it's valid. Let me look at the first program's check function:\n\nIn check, the first loop finds the first h[i] >0, then computes ch as |x[i]-cx| + |y[i]-cy| + h[i]. So ch must be at least h[i], which is positive. So ch is at least 1. So the third number in the output is ch, which is at least 1. So the second program would take that as x, so if ch is 1, then the second program outputs 0. If ch is 2, then the second program outputs 1. Then the third program takes that 0 or 1 as the input year, which is invalid. So this is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the sequence is not as I thought. Maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program is not part of the sequence? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the three Java files are separate, and the user wants to translate each into Fortran, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input, and the final Fortran program must do all steps in one go, without I/O in the middle.\n\nAh, right! The user says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" So the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, and the Fortran program must do all steps in one program, with only the first block reading input, the last producing output, and intermediate steps without I/O.\n\nSo the first Java program's input is from stdin, and its output is passed to the second program's input, which outputs to the third program's input, which outputs to stdout. The Fortran program must read the initial input, process through all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (the first program's input is N followed by N lines of x y h).\n\n2. Run the first program's logic, producing its output (the three numbers i j ch).\n\n3. Take that output, pass it as input to the second program. The second program takes the first number (i?), or the third (ch?), but according to the second program's code, it reads an integer x. So the second program's input is the first number of the first program's output. Let me see: the first program's output is three numbers separated by spaces. The second program reads the first integer (the first number in the line). So the second program's input is the first number (i) from the first program's output. Then the second program outputs 0 or 1 (the inverse of i). Then the third program takes that 0 or 1 as its input (the year y). But that's a problem because the third program expects a year, which is a 4-digit number. So this suggests that perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the third number (ch) as input. Let me see:\n\nFirst program's output is \"i j ch\". The second program reads the first integer (i), but if i is, say, 100, then the second program would output 0. Then the third program would take 0 as the input year, which is invalid. Alternatively, maybe the second program takes the third number (ch) as input. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is three numbers, say 5 3 7. The second program reads the first number (5), so x is 5, which is not 1, so the second program outputs 1. Then the third program takes 1 as the input year. But 1 is a valid year (though not a leap year). The third program would then process that. Alternatively, if the first program's output is 1 2 3, then the second program would read 1, output 0, then the third program takes 0 as the year, which is invalid. Hmm, but the third program's code uses check_leap(y), which for y=0 would return false (since 0 mod 400 is 0, but 0 mod 400 is 0, but 0 is a leap year? Wait, the check_leap function is defined as:\n\nstatic boolean check_leap(int y) {\n    return y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n}\n\nSo for y=0, 0 mod 400 is 0, so it would return true. So 0 is considered a leap year here. So the third program can handle it, but the problem is that the input to the third program is the output of the second program, which is 0 or 1. So the third program's input is a year which is either 0 or 1. That's possible, but perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is three numbers, and the second program takes the third number (ch) as input. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"i j ch\", then the second program takes ch as input. So if ch is 1, then the second program outputs 0, which is then the input to the third program. The third program would process that. Alternatively, maybe the second program takes the third number (ch) as input. Let me see the second program's code again. The second program's input is a single integer, so it reads the first token from the input. The first program's output is three numbers separated by spaces, so the first token is the first number (i). So the second program will read i, not ch. So the second program's input is the first number of the first program's output. The second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. The third program takes that as the year. So the third program's input is 0 or 1, which is a valid year (though perhaps not meaningful, but the code can handle it).\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is three numbers: i j ch.\n\nSecond program takes the first number (i) as input, outputs 0 or 1 (if i is 1, output 0; else 1).\n\nThird program takes that 0 or 1 as the input year y, and computes the next year as per its logic.\n\nThe final output is the third program's output (the found year).\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and N lines of x y h).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (i j ch).\n\n3. Take the first number (i) from that output, compute the second program's result (0 or 1).\n\n4. Take that result (0 or 1) as the input to the third program, compute the third program's output (the year).\n\n5. Output that final year.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all this.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read N, then N lines of x, y, h arrays.\n\n- Compute the first program's output (i, j, ch). The first program loops over all i and j from 0 to 100 (since MAX is 100). For each (i,j), compute ch via the check function. If ch is valid (>=0), then output i j ch. The first such valid triplet is printed? Or all valid ones? Looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program loops over all i and j from 0 to MAX (inclusive). For each (i,j), calls check(n, x, y, h, i, j). If the returned ch is >0, then it prints the triplet. So the first program may print multiple lines, but the problem says that the output of each program is used as input to the next. So the first program's output is all lines, but the second program would read the first line's first number. Wait, but in Java, the first program's output is multiple lines, but the second program would read the first integer from the first line. So in the sequence, the first program's output is all lines, but the second program reads the first integer from the first line. So in the Fortran program, we need to process the first program's logic, find the first valid (i,j,ch) triplet (since the first program's code prints all valid triplets, but perhaps there is only one valid solution?), but the problem may require that the first program's first output line is taken. Wait, the first program's code loops over all i and j, and for each, if check returns ch>0, it prints the triplet. So there could be multiple outputs, but the problem's sequence requires that the second program takes the first line's first number. However, in the original Java code, the first program may output multiple lines, but the second program would read the first integer from the first line. So in the Fortran program, we need to find the first valid triplet (i,j,ch) and take its first element (i) as the input to the second step.\n\nWait, but the first program's code may have multiple valid (i,j,ch) triplets. For example, if there are multiple centers that satisfy the conditions. The first program would print all of them. But the second program would read the first line's first number. So in the Fortran program, we need to find the first valid triplet (i,j,ch) in the order of the loops (i from 0 to MAX, j from 0 to MAX for each i). The first such triplet encountered is the one that would be first in the output, so the second program would take its i value.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, we need to loop over i from 0 to 100, then j from 0 to 100, and for each (i,j), compute ch via the check function. The first (i,j) where check returns a positive ch is the one we need. Because the first program's code would print all valid triplets, but the second program would read the first line's first number. So in the Fortran code, we can stop at the first valid (i,j) and take that i as the input to the second step. Wait, but the first program's code may have multiple valid triplets, but the problem's sequence requires that the second program takes the first one's i. So in the Fortran code, we need to find the first (i,j) in the loop order where check returns a positive ch, then take that i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's code has exactly one valid solution, so the first occurrence is the correct one. But to be safe, we need to process all possible (i,j) in order and pick the first valid one.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, then N lines of x, y, h arrays.\n\n2. For i from 0 to 100:\n\n   a. For j from 0 to 100:\n\n      i. Compute ch via the check function.\n\n      ii. If ch >0, then record this (i,j,ch) as the first valid one and break loops.\n\n3. Once the first valid (i,j,ch) is found, take the i value.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result: if i ==1, then result is 0 else 1.\n\n5. Take that result (0 or 1) as the input to the third program's y.\n\n6. Compute the third program's output: find the next year after y where the sum of days from y+1 to that year (inclusive?) such that the total days mod7 is 0, and the leap status of the found year matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nThe third program's code starts with y = input (the result from the second program, which is 0 or 1). Then it loops i starting from y+1 upwards. For each i, it adds 365 or 366 days (depending on leap of i) to sum. Then checks if sum mod7 is 0. If so, then checks if the leap status of i is same as the original y's leap status. If so, output i and exit.\n\nWait, the original y's leap status is check_leap(y). The code for the third program:\n\nboolean leap = check_leap(y); // original year's leap status.\n\nThen for each i starting from y+1:\n\nsum += days of i (366 if leap, else 365).\n\nThen, when sum mod7 ==0:\n\nif ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ) \u2192 meaning that the leap status of i is same as original y's leap status \u2192 then output i and return.\n\nSo the third program's logic is to find the first i > y such that:\n\nsum of days from y+1 to i (inclusive?) \u2192 no, the code adds for each i (starting from y+1) the days of that i. Wait, the loop is for i = y+1, then adding days for i, then checking sum mod7. So the sum is cumulative from y+1 up to i. Wait, the code is:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n\n   if leap(i) \u2192 add 366, else 365 to sum.\n\n   then check if sum mod7 ==0 \u2192 if yes, check leap status of i and original y's leap.\n\n}\n\nSo the sum is the total days from y+1 up to and including i. Because each iteration adds the days of i, then checks.\n\nSo the first i where the sum of days from y+1 to i is divisible by 7, and the leap status of i matches the original y's leap status.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step is to compute this.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n- Read N and the N lines of x, y, h.\n\n- Find the first (i,j) in the loops (i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100) where check returns a positive ch. The first such (i,j) is chosen.\n\n- Take the i value from that triplet.\n\n- Compute the second step's result (0 or 1).\n\n- Use that result as the input y for the third step.\n\n- Compute the third step's output (the desired year).\n\n- Output that year.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need arrays for x, y, h. Since N can be up to, say, 100 (since the first program uses MAX=100, but N could be up to that). Let's assume N is up to 100.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read N, then read N lines of x, y, h.\n\nThen, the check function. Let's translate the check function into a Fortran function.\n\nThe check function in Java:\n\nprivate static int check(int n, int[] x, int[] y, int[] h, int cx, int cy) {\n\n    int ch = -1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if (h[i] > 0) {\n\n            ch = Math.abs(x[i] - cx) + Math.abs(y[i] - cy) + h[i];\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if (h[i] != Math.max(ch - Math.abs(x[i] - cx) - Math.abs(y[i] - cy), 0)) {\n\n            return -1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return ch;\n\n}\n\nSo the function first finds the first h[i] >0, computes ch as the Manhattan distance from (cx,cy) plus h[i]. Then, for all points, check if h[i] equals max(ch - (distance), 0). If any fails, return -1. Else return ch.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be written as a function:\n\nFUNCTION check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) RESULT(ch_result)\n\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n, x(n), y(n), h(n), cx, cy\n\n    INTEGER :: ch, i\n\n    ch = -1\n\n    DO i = 1, n\n\n        IF (h(i) > 0) THEN\n\n            ch = ABS(x(i) - cx) + ABS(y(i) - cy) + h(i)\n\n            EXIT\n\n        END IF\n\n    END DO\n\n    IF (ch == -1) THEN\n\n        ch_result = -1\n\n        RETURN\n\n    END IF\n\n    DO i = 1, n\n\n        INTEGER :: temp = ch - ABS(x(i) - cx) - ABS(y(i) - cy)\n\n        IF (h(i) /= MAX(temp, 0)) THEN\n\n            ch_result = -1\n\n            RETURN\n\n        END IF\n\n    END DO\n\n    ch_result = ch\n\nEND FUNCTION check\n\nWait, note that in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so the loops in the first Java code (0-based) need to be adjusted. So in the first loop, in Java it's from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, the array indices are 1-based, so the loop would be from 1 to n.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the arrays are initialized with new int[n], so indices 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, when we read N points, the arrays x, y, h will be of size N, with indices 1 to N.\n\nTherefore, in the check function, the loops are from 1 to n.\n\nNow, the main program steps:\n\nRead N, then read N lines of x, y, h.\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to 100 (inclusive), and for each i, loop j from 0 to 100. For each (i,j), compute ch via check function. The first (i,j) where ch>0 is the one we need.\n\nOnce found, take the i value.\n\nThen compute the second step's result: if i ==1, then result is 0 else 1.\n\nThen, compute the third step's output.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\nThe third program's code is to find the next year after y (the second step's result) such that:\n\nsum of days from y+1 to i (inclusive) is divisible by 7, and the leap status of i matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the original y's leap status is check_leap(y). The code for the third program:\n\nleap = check_leap(y)\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor i from y+1 upwards:\n\n   add days of i (366 if leap(i), else 365) to sum.\n\n   if sum mod7 ==0:\n\n       if (leap(i) == leap):\n\n           output i and exit.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can code this as a loop:\n\nFUNCTION find_next_year(y) RESULT(result_year)\n\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: y\n\n    INTEGER :: current_year, sum_days, leap_y, leap_i\n\n    LOGICAL :: leap_y_flag, leap_i_flag\n\n    leap_y_flag = check_leap(y)\n\n    sum_days = 0\n\n    current_year = y + 1\n\n    DO\n\n        leap_i_flag = check_leap(current_year)\n\n        IF (leap_i_flag) THEN\n\n            sum_days = sum_days + 366\n\n        ELSE\n\n            sum_days = sum_days + 365\n\n        END IF\n\n        IF (MOD(sum_days,7) == 0) THEN\n\n            IF (leap_i_flag .EQV. leap_y_flag) THEN\n\n                result_year = current_year\n\n                RETURN\n\n            END IF\n\n        END IF\n\n        current_year = current_year + 1\n\n    END DO\n\nEND FUNCTION find_next_year\n\nWait, but this is an infinite loop until it finds the correct current_year. So in Fortran, we can code this with a loop that increments current_year each time.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nRead N, then read N lines of x, y, h.\n\nFind the first (i,j) in the loops (i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100) where check returns ch>0.\n\nTake the i value from that.\n\nCompute second_step = 0 if i ==1 else 1.\n\nCompute the third step's result by calling find_next_year(second_step).\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need arrays for x, y, h. Let's use a maximum N of, say, 100 (since the first program uses MAX=100, but N can be up to that).\n\nINTEGER, PARAMETER :: MAX_N = 100\n\nINTEGER :: N, x(MAX_N), y(MAX_N), h(MAX_N)\n\nThen read N, then read N lines:\n\nREAD*, N\n\nDO i = 1, N\n\n    READ*, x(i), y(i), h(i)\n\nEND DO\n\nThen, the loops for i and j:\n\nLOGICAL :: found = .FALSE.\n\nINTEGER :: i_val, j_val, ch_val\n\nDO i = 0, 100\n\n    DO j = 0, 100\n\n        ch_val = check(N, x, y, h, i, j)\n\n        IF (ch_val > 0) THEN\n\n            i_val = i\n\n            j_val = j\n\n            found = .TRUE.\n\n            EXIT\n\n        END IF\n\n    END DO\n\n    IF (found) EXIT\n\nEND DO\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loops can be structured with nested loops. The outer loop over i from 0 to 100, inner over j from 0 to 100. For each (i,j), compute ch_val. If found, exit both loops.\n\nOnce found, we have i_val = i.\n\nThen, compute second_step:\n\nsecond_step = 0\n\nIF (i_val == 1) THEN\n\n    second_step = 0\n\nELSE\n\n    second_step = 1\n\nEND IF\n\nWait, the second program's code is:\n\nx = input integer.\n\nresult = ! (x ==1) \u2192 so if x is 1 \u2192 result is 0, else 1.\n\nSo second_step = 0 if i_val is 1, else 1.\n\nThen, compute the third step's result:\n\nresult_year = find_next_year(second_step)\n\nFinally, print result_year.\n\nNow, the functions:\n\nFirst, the check function.\n\nFUNCTION check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) RESULT(ch_result)\n\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n, x(n), y(n), h(n), cx, cy\n\n    INTEGER :: ch, i\n\n    ch = -1\n\n    DO i = 1, n\n\n        IF (h(i) > 0) THEN\n\n            ch = ABS(x(i) - cx) + ABS(y(i) - cy) + h(i)\n\n            EXIT\n\n        END IF\n\n    END DO\n\n    IF (ch == -1) THEN\n\n        ch_result = -1\n\n        RETURN\n\n    END IF\n\n    DO i = 1, n\n\n        INTEGER :: temp = ch - ABS(x(i) - cx) - ABS(y(i) - cy)\n\n        IF (h(i) /= MAX(temp, 0)) THEN\n\n            ch_result = -1\n\n            RETURN\n\n        END IF\n\n    END DO\n\n    ch_result = ch\n\nEND FUNCTION check\n\nThen, the check_leap function:\n\nFUNCTION check_leap(y) RESULT(is_leap)\n\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: y\n\n    LOGICAL :: is_leap\n\n    is_leap = MOD(y,400) == 0 .OR.

Maybe the code will eventually find a year. But the point is, the code should work.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the functions are correctly implemented.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The check function in Fortran must correctly handle the arrays (1-based).\n\n- The loops in the first part must iterate i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100, in the correct order.\n\n- The second step's calculation is correct.\n\n- The find_next_year function correctly accumulates the days and checks the conditions.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first program's check function, the first h[i] >0 is used to compute ch. In Fortran, the loop starts at i=1 (first element), so that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the first program's code, the loops are for i from 0 to MAX (100), and j from 0 to MAX. The first valid (i,j) in the order of increasing i, then j is chosen. The Fortran code loops i from 0 to 100, and for each i, loops j from 0 to 100. So the first valid (i,j) is the first in the order of i increasing, then j increasing. Which matches the Java code's order.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
