    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (ABC167_C) reads input values n, m, x, and then an array a. It then iterates over all subsets of the books (since it's using a bitmask approach with 2^n possibilities) to find the minimum cost where the sum of each subject's proficiency meets or exceeds x. The output is the minimum cost or -1 if impossible.\n\nThe second Java file (ABC169_D) takes a long n, factors it, and calculates some kind of count based on the exponents of its prime factors. The output is the answer derived from that.\n\nThe third Java file (ABC158_A) checks if a string contains both 'A' and 'B' and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But since they are in sequence, the entire Fortran program must process the input through all three steps without I/O in between.\n\nWait, but how do the outputs of each Java program connect? Let me see:\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is the min value (or -1). The second program expects a long n as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second. Then the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final result.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string. Wait, the third Java program's input is a single string, which is checked for containing 'A' and 'B'. But the second program's output is a number (the answer). So how does that connect?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects a long n as input. So the first program's output (a number) is the input to the second. Then the second's output (another number) is the input to the third. But the third expects a string. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the third Java program (ABC158_A):\n\nIt reads a string s from input. So the input to the third program must be a string. But the second program's output is a number. So how does that work? Unless the second program's output is a number that is then converted into a string for the third program's input. But in the original setup, the outputs are passed as input to the next program. So the first program's output is a number (min or -1), which is then the input to the second program. The second program's output is another number (the answer from ABC169_D), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the three Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, each taking input from the previous program's output. But the third program requires a string input, but the second program outputs a number. That would mean that the second program's output is a number, which is then converted into a string for the third program. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three Java programs are part of a chain where each program's output is the next's input. But the third program's input is a string, so the second program's output must be a string. Wait, but the second program's output is a number. So perhaps the second program's output is written as a string (like \"123\"), which is then read as the string input for the third program. But the third program checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B', which would only be true if the number's string representation has those letters. But numbers don't have letters A or B except in hexadecimal, but the input is a string. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but perhaps I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three Java programs are not connected in a chain where each's output is the next's input. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, but according to the problem statement, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a number. But the third program expects a string. So perhaps the second program's output is a number, which is then converted to a string (like \"5\"), and that's the input to the third program. The third program would then check if that string contains 'A' and 'B', which it won't unless the number is like 10 (but in hex?), but in the problem's context, maybe the third program is expecting a different input. Wait, perhaps the third program is part of a different problem, and the user's setup is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the three Java programs are not meant to be connected in a chain but are separate, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed as per the problem's instruction, assuming that the outputs are passed as inputs between the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output is a number (min or -1), which is then the input to the second program (which expects a long n). Then the second program's output is a number (the answer), which is then the input to the third program, which expects a string. So the third program would read that number as a string, and check if it contains 'A' and 'B'. But numbers don't have letters, so the third program would output \"No\" unless the number is written in a way that includes those letters, which is unlikely. But perhaps the problem's actual setup is different. Maybe the three Java programs are separate, but the user wants them all in one Fortran program, with the first handling input, the last handling output, and the middle steps processing without I/O. Wait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the entire sequence is first -> second -> third, with the first reading from stdin, the third writing to stdout, and the middle steps passing data in memory.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through all three steps, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (ABC167_C). The first program's input is n, m, x, followed by n lines each with m+1 integers.\n\n2. Process the first step (ABC167_C's logic) to compute the minimum cost (min) or -1.\n\n3. Take that min value (or -1) as the input to the second step (ABC169_D's logic). The second program's input is a long n, so the min value (which is an integer) is passed as n. The second step computes an answer based on the factors of n.\n\n4. Take the answer from the second step (an integer) and pass it as the input to the third step (ABC158_A's logic). The third step expects a string, so the answer from the second step is converted to a string, and the third step checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string. So the second step's output (a number) must be converted to a string. For example, if the second step outputs 123, then the third step's input is \"123\", which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so the output would be \"No\". But if the second step's output is, say, 10 (in hex?), but in the problem's context, the third program is expecting a string like \"AB\" or something else. Hmm, perhaps the third program is part of a different problem, but according to the given code, it's correct. So the third program's input is a single string, which is the output of the second program. So the second program's output is a number, which is written as a string (e.g., \"5\"), and that's the input to the third program. The third program checks if that string has both 'A' and 'B', which would only be true if the number's string representation includes those letters, which is impossible unless the number is part of a hexadecimal string, but in the problem's context, it's a decimal number. So the third program would always output \"No\" unless the second's output is something like \"AB123\", but that's not possible. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here, but I have to proceed as per the code given.\n\nSo, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first step (ABC167_C's input).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (min or -1).\n\n- Use that result as the input to the second step (ABC169_D's n).\n\n- Compute the second step's result (the answer).\n\n- Convert that answer to a string and pass it to the third step (ABC158_A's input).\n\n- Compute the third step's result (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n- Output that final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program (ABC167_C):\n\nThe first program reads n, m, x, then n lines each with m+1 integers. The code then iterates over all subsets (bitmask from 0 to 2^n -1), checks for each subset if the sum of each subject's proficiency meets x, and tracks the minimum cost (res[0]).\n\nIn Fortran, we need to read n, m, x, then read the a array. The a array is n rows, each with m+1 elements (the first element is the cost, then m elements for each subject's proficiency).\n\nThe bitmask loop is from 0 to 2^n -1. For each bitmask, we check each bit to see if the book is selected. Then accumulate the sum for each subject. Then check if all subjects meet x. If so, track the minimum cost.\n\nIn Fortran, loops can be done with do loops. The bitmask can be represented as an integer, but since n can be up to, say, 20 (since 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable?), but the original code uses Math.pow(2,n), which could be up to 2^30 or something, but in practice, maybe n is small. Let's see the constraints from the problem. The original problem (ABC167_C) is probably from AtCoder, so looking up the problem constraints: for ABC167 C, the constraints are n \u2264 20, m \u2264 10^5, but wait, no, perhaps n is up to 20 because 2^20 is manageable. Let me check the problem's constraints. Well, since the code uses Math.pow(2,n), which for n=20 is 1e6, which is manageable. So in Fortran, we can loop over all possible subsets.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first step's variables:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nThen read a(n, m+1). Wait, in Java it's a 2D array of size n x (m+1). In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with indices starting at 0. Wait, but in Java, the loops are from 0 to n-1 for i, and 0 to m for j. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays, but adjust the indices accordingly. Alternatively, use 0-based. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, declare a(n, m+1) as a 2D array, with indices from 1 to n and 1 to m+1. Then when reading, for each row i from 1 to n, read m+1 integers into a(i, 1) to a(i, m+1).\n\nThen, for each subset (bitmask from 0 to 2**n -1):\n\nWe can represent the bitmask as an integer. For each bit in the bitmask, check if the j-th bit is set (for j from 0 to n-1). Wait, in Java, the code uses (1 & (i >> j)) ==1. So for each j from 0 to n-1, the j-th bit of i (the bitmask) is checked. So in Fortran, for a given bitmask, we can loop over each book (j from 1 to n?), and check if the bit is set.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for j is from 0 to n-1 (since j < n). So in Fortran, perhaps j runs from 1 to n, but the bitmask is stored as an integer. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, the bitmask can be an integer. For each bitmask in 0 to 2**n -1:\n\nLoop over each book (from 1 to n):\n\nCheck if the (j-1)th bit is set (since in Java, j starts at 0). So for book j (1-based in Fortran), the bit position is j-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to loop over each bit in the bitmask. Let me think of code structure.\n\nThe steps for the first part:\n\nInitialize min to a large value (like huge(0) in Fortran).\n\nLoop over all possible subsets (bitmask from 0 to 2**n -1):\n\n   Initialize res array (size m+1, with res(1) being the total cost, res(2) to res(m+1) being the subject proficiencies).\n\n   res(1) = 0, and the rest are 0.\n\n   For each book (j from 1 to n):\n\n      if the j-th bit (bit j-1 in the bitmask) is set:\n\n          add a(j,1) to res(1) (the cost)\n\n          loop over k from 2 to m+1 (since the first element is cost, then m subjects):\n\n              res(k) = res(k) + a(j,k)\n\n   Then check if all res(2) to res(m+1) >= x.\n\n   If yes, then check if res(1) is less than current min, and update min.\n\nAt the end, if min is still the initial value, output -1 else min.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the res array is initialized as new int[m+1], so the first element (index 0) is the cost, and the rest are the subjects. So in Fortran, the first element (index 1) is the cost, and the next m elements (indices 2 to m+1) are the subjects. So when checking, for each subject from 1 to m (Java's j from 1 to m), in Fortran, that would be indices 2 to m+1.\n\nSo the code for the first part in Fortran would be something like:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nRead the a array (n rows, each with m+1 integers).\n\nInitialize min to a large value (like 1e9 or huge(0)).\n\nThen loop over all possible subsets (bitmask from 0 to 2**n -1):\n\n   cost = 0\n\n   prof = array of size m+1 (since m subjects plus cost)\n\n   prof(1) = 0\n\n   do k = 2, m+1\n\n      prof(k) = 0\n\n   end do\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (bitmask has the (j-1)th bit set) then\n\n          cost = cost + a(j,1)\n\n          do k = 2, m+1\n\n              prof(k) = prof(k) + a(j,k)\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   check if all prof(2) to prof(m+1) >= x:\n\n   flag = .true.\n\n   do k = 2, m+1\n\n      if (prof(k) < x) then\n\n          flag = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then\n\n       if (cost < min) then\n\n           min = cost\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nend loop over bitmask.\n\nThen, after all subsets, if min is still the initial value, set it to -1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the bitmask can be represented as an integer. The loop over all subsets can be done with a loop from 0 to 2**n -1. However, for n up to 20, 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable. But in Fortran, integers can be 32 or 64 bits, so for n up to 30, 2^30 is about a billion, which might be too big. But given the original code uses Math.pow(2,n), which in Java can handle up to n=30 (since 2^30 is about a billion, but in Java, an int can only go up to 2^31-1, so for n=30, 2^30 is okay as a long). But in the problem's context, perhaps n is small enough.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo bitmask = 0, 2**n -1\n\nBut in Fortran, exponentiation is done with **. However, 2**n can be a large number. For n=20, 2^20 is 1,048,576. For n=30, it's over a billion, which would be a problem for the loop. But given the original code uses Math.pow(2,n), which in Java can handle up to n=63 (as a long), but in practice, the problem's constraints probably limit n to a manageable size. Let's proceed under the assumption that n is small enough.\n\nNow, checking the bits: For each j from 1 to n, check if the (j-1)th bit is set in the bitmask.\n\nIn Fortran, to check if the (j-1)th bit is set, we can do:\n\nif (btest(bitmask, j-1)) then\n\nYes, the btest function returns .true. if the bit is set.\n\nSo the code for the first part is manageable.\n\nNow, the second Java program (ABC169_D):\n\nThe second program takes a long n, factors it, and calculates an answer based on the exponents of its prime factors.\n\nThe code:\n\nInitialize sqrt as integer sqrt(n).\n\nanswer starts at 0.\n\nLoop over i from 2 to sqrt:\n\n   count the exponent of i in n's factors.\n\n   Then, for each j from 1 upwards until count -j >=0, add 1 to answer each time.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int j = 1; count - j >=0; j++) {\n\n    count -= j;\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, this loop is a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nThe loop starts with j=1, and while count -j >=0, subtract j from count and increment answer. So for example, if count is 5:\n\nj=1: count becomes 4, answer +=1 (total 1)\n\nj=2: 4-2=2 >=0 \u2192 count becomes 2, answer +=1 (total 2)\n\nj=3: 2-3 <0 \u2192 stop. So total 2 steps.\n\nWait, but the loop is written as for (j=1; count-j >=0; j++). Wait, the condition is checked before each iteration. So the first iteration j=1, then j increments to 2, etc. Wait, the loop is written as for (int j=1; count-j >=0; j++) { ... }\n\nWait, the loop condition is count -j >=0. So for j=1, if count >=1, then enter loop. Then subtract j from count, then j increments to 2. Then check again: count (now count-1) -2 >=0?\n\nWait, let me see with count=5:\n\nInitial count=5.\n\nFirst iteration j=1:\n\ncount -j =5-1=4 >=0 \u2192 enter loop.\n\nInside: count -=j \u2192 count becomes 4.\n\nanswer +=1 \u2192 answer is 1.\n\nThen j increments to 2.\n\nNext iteration: check count (4) -2 =2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 4-2=2 \u2192 count=2.\n\nanswer becomes 2.\n\nj increments to 3.\n\nCheck count (2) -3 \u2192 -1 <0 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nSo total 2 increments. So the loop runs for j=1 and 2, giving answer +=2.\n\nWait, but the loop's condition is checked before each iteration. So the loop runs while the condition is true. So the first iteration is j=1, then j increments, then check again.\n\nWait, the loop is for (j=1; condition; j++) { ... }\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize j=1.\n\nCheck condition (count -j >=0). If yes, execute loop body, then increment j.\n\nSo for count=5:\n\nj=1 \u2192 condition 5-1=4 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nBody: count becomes 4, answer +=1.\n\nj becomes 2.\n\nCheck 4-2=2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nBody: count becomes 2, answer +=1 (total 2).\n\nj becomes 3.\n\nCheck 2-3 =-1 <0 \u2192 no. Exit loop.\n\nThus, the total is 2.\n\nAnother example: count=3.\n\nj=1: 3-1=2 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 2, answer 1.\n\nj=2: 2-2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 0, answer 2.\n\nj=3: 0-3 \u2192 no \u2192 exit.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nAnother example: count=6.\n\nj=1: 6-1=5 \u2192 yes. count=5 \u2192 answer 1.\n\nj=2:5-2=3 \u2192 yes. count=3 \u2192 answer 2.\n\nj=3:3-3=0 \u2192 yes. count=0 \u2192 answer 3.\n\nj=4:0-4 \u2192 no \u2192 exit.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo the loop is effectively counting the number of terms in the sequence 1+2+3+...+k \u2264 count. The maximum k where the sum of 1+2+...+k \u2264 count. The answer increments by 1 for each j up to that k.\n\nThe total answer for this exponent is the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count.\n\nWait, the sum of 1+2+...+k is k(k+1)/2. So the maximum k where this is \u2264 count. The number of terms is k.\n\nWait, in the first example with count=5, the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22645 is 2 (since 3*4/2=6>5). So the answer increments by 2.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo the loop is effectively finding the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count, and adding that k to the answer.\n\nAlternatively, the total added to the answer is the maximum k such that k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count.\n\nSo the code can be rewritten as:\n\nfor each prime factor i with exponent count:\n\n   k = floor( (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2 )\n\n   answer +=k\n\nWait, but in code, the loop is doing exactly that.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each prime factor i (from 2 to sqrt(n)), we can compute the exponent count, then compute k as the maximum integer where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. Then add k to the answer.\n\nAlternatively, compute k via the loop as in the original code.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop can be implemented similarly.\n\nSo the steps for the second part:\n\nTake the input (the min from first step, which is an integer, possibly -1). Wait, but the second program expects a long n. So if the first step's output is -1, then the second program's input is -1, but the code would have issues because sqrt of a negative number is invalid. Wait, but in the original code, the first program's output is either the min (which is at least 0, since it's the sum of costs) or -1. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is -1, which would cause an error in the second program's code. But according to the problem's setup, perhaps the first program's output is only valid when min is not -1, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence. So perhaps in the Fortran code, we need to handle that case. But according to the problem's instruction, the Fortran program must behave identically. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would read that as n = -1, which would cause an error in the second program's code (since sqrt of negative is not possible). But in the original Java code, the second program's code would have n as a long, but when n is negative, the sqrt would be (int) Math.sqrt(-1), which would be 0, but then the loop from 2 to sqrt(n) (which is 0) would not run. Then, since n is still -1 (after the loop), the code would check if n>1 (which is false), so the answer remains 0. Then the third program would get 0 as input, which is \"0\", so the third program would output \"No\".\n\nBut in the original Java code, the second program's code would have n as a long. If the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is -1, which is read as a long. Then, the code computes sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(-1), which would be 0. The loop from 2 to 0 doesn't run. Then, since n is -1, which is not >1, so the answer remains 0. So the second program's output is 0, which is passed to the third program as \"0\", leading to \"No\".\n\nSo in the Fortran code, we need to handle n being negative. So in the second step's code, when n is negative, the code should set answer to 0, and proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second step's code:\n\nRead n (the output from first step).\n\nIf n < 1, then the answer is 0 (since the loop won't run, and n is not >1 at the end).\n\nElse:\n\nCompute sqrt_n = integer part of sqrt(n).\n\nanswer =0\n\nloop i from 2 to sqrt_n:\n\n   count =0\n\n   while mod(n, i) ==0:\n\n       n = n/i\n\n       count +=1\n\n   if count >0:\n\n       compute k via the loop:\n\n       k =0\n\n       j=1\n\n       do while (count -j >=0):\n\n           count = count -j\n\n           answer +=1\n\n           j +=1\n\n       end do\n\n   end if\n\nend loop i\n\nthen, if n >1 (meaning it's a prime factor larger than sqrt_n):\n\n   count =1 (since it's a prime factor left)\n\n   compute k for count=1:\n\n   j=1:\n\n   count -j =0 \u2192 yes.\n\n   answer +=1\n\n   j becomes 2 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nSo the code for the second part in Fortran would need to handle this.\n\nNow, the third Java program (ABC158_A):\n\nIt reads a string s and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn Fortran, the input to the third step is the answer from the second step, which is an integer. So we need to convert that integer to a string, then check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the integer is a number. So converting it to a string would give digits, which don't include letters. So the third program would always output \"No\" unless the number is part of a string with letters, which is not possible. But according to the problem's setup, this is the required sequence. So in the Fortran code, the third step's input is the answer from the second step (an integer), which is converted to a string, then checked for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write and read. For example:\n\ninteger :: num = 123\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nwrite(str, '(i0)') num\n\nthen check if 'A' and 'B' are in str.\n\nBut in the string representation of a number, there are no letters except possibly in some cases (like hexadecimal?), but the default is decimal. So the third program will always output \"No\" unless the number is part of a string with letters, which is not possible. But according to the problem's code, that's what must be done.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step's code would be:\n\nTake the answer from the second step (an integer), convert it to a string, then check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for first step (n, m, x, then the a array).\n\n2. Compute first step's result (min or -1).\n\n3. Compute second step's result (answer) using the first's result as n.\n\n4. Convert the second's answer to a string.\n\n5. Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n6. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read the first input (for the first step), then process through all steps.\n\nThe first step's variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, x\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: a\n\nThe second step's variables:\n\ninteger :: n_second (the first step's output)\n\ninteger :: answer_second\n\nThe third step's variables:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_third\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the first step's input.\n\nProcess first step to get min_val (the first step's output).\n\nThen, set n_second = min_val.\n\nProcess second step with n_second to get answer_second.\n\nConvert answer_second to a string s_third.\n\nCheck if s_third contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nOutput \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first step's code:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nThen read the a array. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So in Fortran, the a array will be (n rows, m+1 columns). So:\n\nallocate(a(n, m+1))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*,*) (a(i,j), j=1, m+1)\n\nend do\n\nThen compute the min_val.\n\nInitialize min_val to a large value, say, huge(0). But in Fortran, the maximum integer is huge(0), but if the first step's min could be up to sum of all a's first elements (costs). So perhaps initializing to a very large value like 1e18.\n\nmin_val = huge(0)\n\ndo bitmask = 0, 2**n -1\n\n   cost =0\n\n   prof(1) =0\n\n   do k =2, m+1\n\n      prof(k) =0\n\n   end do\n\n   do j =1, n\n\n      if (btest(bitmask, j-1)) then\n\n          cost = cost + a(j,1)\n\n          do k =2, m+1\n\n              prof(k) = prof(k) + a(j,k)\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   flag = .true.\n\n   do k =2, m+1\n\n      if (prof(k) < x) then\n\n          flag = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then\n\n       if (cost < min_val) then\n\n           min_val = cost\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (min_val == huge(0)) then\n\n   min_val = -1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the initial value must be set properly. So perhaps initializing min_val to a very large value, like 1e18, and then after the loop, if it's still that value, set to -1.\n\nNow, the second step's code:\n\nn_second = min_val\n\nif (n_second < 1) then\n\n   answer_second =0\n\nelse\n\n   answer_second =0\n\n   sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n_second)))\n\n   do i =2, sqrt_n\n\n      count =0\n\n      temp = n_second\n\n      do while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n          temp = temp/i\n\n          count = count +1\n\n      end do\n\n      if (count >0) then\n\n          ! compute k via loop\n\n          j =1\n\n          do while (count -j >=0)\n\n              count = count -j\n\n              answer_second = answer_second +1\n\n              j = j +1\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n      ! update n_second\n\n      n_second = temp\n\n      ! but wait, after dividing by i, but need to loop over i again?\n\n      Wait, no. The code in Java divides n by i until it's not divisible, then proceeds. So in the code above, after dividing, the temp is the remaining n after removing factors of i. But in the loop over i, we need to continue with the updated n_second. Wait, perhaps I need to restructure this.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) {\n\n    int count =0;\n\n    while (n%i ==0) { n/=i; count++; }\n\n    ... process count ...\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should be:\n\nn_second is the input (from first step).\n\nWe need to loop over i from 2 to sqrt_n, and for each i, count how many times it divides n_second.\n\nSo:\n\ntemp = n_second\n\ncount =0\n\nwhile mod(temp, i) ==0:\n\n   temp = temp/i\n\n   count +=1\n\nthen, after the loop, count is the exponent.\n\nBut in the code above, the code is:\n\ntemp = n_second\n\ncount =0\n\ndo while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n   temp = temp/i\n\n   count = count +1\n\nend do\n\nthen, if count>0, process it.\n\nBut after this, the n_second is updated to temp?\n\nWait, no. Because in the Java code, after dividing by i, the n is updated. So in the next iterations, the n is the reduced value. So in Fortran, after processing i, the n_second should be set to temp.\n\nWait, but in the loop over i from 2 to sqrt_n, the original n_second is being modified. So in the code:\n\nWe need to track the current value of n_second as it's being divided.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\noriginal_n = n_second\n\nanswer_second =0\n\nsqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(original_n)))\n\ndo i=2, sqrt_n\n\n   count =0\n\n   temp = original_n\n\n   do while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n       temp = temp/i\n\n       count = count +1\n\n   end do\n\n   if (count >0) then\n\n       ! process count\n\n       j=1\n\n       do while (count -j >=0)\n\n           count = count -j\n\n           answer_second = answer_second +1\n\n           j = j +1\n\n       end do\n\n   end if\n\n   ! update original_n to temp?\n\n   original_n = temp\n\n   ! but then the sqrt_n may change, but since we are looping up to the original sqrt_n, this may not be correct.\n\nWait, this approach may not work because after dividing by i, the remaining n (original_n) may have a smaller sqrt. But since the loop is up to the original sqrt_n, which is based on the initial n_second, this might miss factors beyond that.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The Java code's loop runs up to the sqrt of the original n, but in reality, after dividing out factors, the sqrt of the remaining n could be smaller. However, the loop in Java is fixed to run up to the initial sqrt. So the code is correct as per the original.\n\nWait, the Java code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= sqrt; i++) {\n\n    ... process i ...\n\n}\n\nwhere sqrt is the initial sqrt(n). So even if n is reduced, the loop continues up to the original sqrt.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can proceed similarly.\n\nThus, the code for the second step:\n\nn_second is the input (from first step).\n\nif (n_second <1) then\n\n   answer_second =0\n\nelse\n\n   original_n = n_second\n\n   answer_second =0\n\n   sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(original_n)))\n\n   do i=2, sqrt_n\n\n      count =0\n\n      temp = original_n\n\n      do while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n          temp = temp/i\n\n          count = count +1\n\n      end do\n\n      if (count >0) then\n\n          j=1\n\n          do while (count -j >=0)\n\n              count = count -j\n\n              answer_second = answer_second +1\n\n              j = j +1\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n      ! update original_n to temp?\n\n      original_n = temp\n\n   end do\n\n   ! after the loop, check if original_n is still >1\n\n   if (original_n >1) then\n\n       ! it's a prime factor larger than sqrt_n\n\n       count =1\n\n       j=1\n\n       do while (count -j >=0)\n\n           count = count -j\n\n           answer_second = answer_second +1\n\n           j = j +1\n\n       end do\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but after the loop over i up to sqrt_n, the remaining original_n may still have factors larger than sqrt_n. The largest possible factor is original_n itself, which is a prime. So in that case, count is 1 (since it's a prime), so the loop for j=1:\n\ncount -j =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nanswer_second +=1.\n\nThus, the code for the remaining part is correct.\n\nNow, the third step:\n\nWe need to convert answer_second to a string, then check for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nwrite(s_third, '(i0)') answer_second\n\nThen, check if 'A' is present and 'B' is present in s_third.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. To check for presence:\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_third)\n\n   if (s_third(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n       hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (s_third(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n       hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut note that the string may have leading spaces if the number is small, but using '(i0)' should avoid that. Alternatively, using adjustl to left-justify.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that leading spaces are removed:\n\ns_third = adjustl(s_third)\n\nThen check.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the entire Fortran program:\n\nBut first, variables:\n\nWe need to read the first step's input, process through all steps.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, x\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:,:)\n\ninteger :: min_val, n_second, answer_second\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_third\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\n!

In Fortran, variables can be declared inside loops. But in some older versions, this might not be allowed, but in modern Fortran (F90+), it's okay.\n\nWait, in the first step's loop over bitmask:\n\nInside the loop, we have:\n\ninteger :: cost, prof(m+1)\n\nBut the size of prof depends on m, which is read from input. So declaring prof(m+1) inside the loop may not be allowed because m is a variable. So we need to declare prof outside the loop with a sufficient size.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because m can be up to, say, 1e5 (as per the problem's constraints?), but in the first Java program's problem (ABC167_C), the constraints for m are probably up to 1e5, but in Fortran, declaring an array of size m+1 inside the loop would be impossible because m is variable and large.\n\nWait, but in the first step's code, m is read from input. So the maximum m can be up to, say, 1e5. But in the loop over bitmask, for each iteration, we need to have an array of size m+1. But in Fortran, you can't have an array with a size that's a variable inside a loop unless you use allocatable arrays, but that would be inefficient.\n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps we need to pre-allocate an array for prof outside the loop.\n\nSo, before the loop over bitmask:\n\nallocate(prof(m+1))\n\nBut then, after the loop, deallocate.\n\nWait, but in the first step's code, the loop over bitmask is inside the main program. So:\n\nInside the first step's processing:\n\nallocate(prof(m+1))\n\nmin_val = huge(0)\n\ndo ... loop over bitmask:\n\n   prof =0\n\n   ... compute ...\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(prof)\n\nBut this is possible.\n\nAlternatively, since m can be up to 1e5, an array of size m+1 may be too big for stack, but in Fortran, arrays are allocated on the heap if declared with allocatable.\n\nSo modifying the first step's code:\n\nAfter reading m:\n\nallocate(prof(m+1))\n\nthen, inside the loop over bitmask:\n\nprof =0\n\n...\n\nAfter the loop, deallocate(prof).\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nInside the first step's processing:\n\nallocate(prof(m+1))\n\nmin_val = huge(0)\n\ndo bitmask =0, 2**n -1\n\n   cost =0\n\n   prof =0\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (btest(bitmask, j-1)) then\n\n          cost = cost + a(j,1)\n\n          do k=2, m+1\n\n              prof(k) = prof(k) + a(j,k)\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   flag = .true.\n\n   do k=2, m+1\n\n      if (prof(k) < x) then\n\n          flag = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then\n\n       if (cost < min_val) then\n\n           min_val = cost\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(prof)\n\nif (min_val == huge(0)) then\n\n   min_val = -1\n\nend if\n\nThis way, the prof array is allocated once, and reused for each bitmask.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\nIn the second step's code, when n_second is -1, the code sets answer_second to 0, which is correct.\n\nIn the third step, converting answer_second to a string and checking for 'A' and 'B' is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's output is 5 (min_val=5).\n\nSecond step's input is 5.\n\nSecond step's processing:\n\nsqrt(5) is ~2.236 \u2192 sqrt_n=2.\n\nLoop i from 2 to 2:\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck if 5 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 no division. count remains 0.\n\nThus, no contribution to answer_second.\n\nThen, after loop, original_n is still 5>1.\n\nThus, count=1.\n\nThe loop for j_val=1:\n\ncount -1 =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nanswer_second +=1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThus, answer_second is 1.\n\nThird step: the string is \"1\", which has no A or B \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where first step's output is 12 (min_val=12).\n\nSecond step:\n\nn_second=12.\n\nsqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 sqrt_n=3.\n\nLoop i from 2 to 3:\n\ni=2:\n\ncount how many times 2 divides 12 \u2192 2^2*3 \u2192 count=2.\n\nProcessing count=2:\n\nj_val starts at 1:\n\ncount -1 =1 \u2192 yes. count becomes 1, answer +=1.\n\nj_val=2 \u2192 count -2 = -1 \u2192 no. So total 1 increment? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, count starts at 2.\n\nFirst iteration j_val=1:\n\ncount -1 =1 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 2-1=1.\n\nanswer +=1 \u2192 answer is 1.\n\nj_val increments to 2.\n\nNext iteration: count (1) -2 \u2192 -1 \u2192 no. So loop ends.\n\nThus, for count=2, the loop adds 1 (only j=1).\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said for count=2, the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22642 is 1 (since 1*2/2=1 \u22642, but 2*3/2=3>2). So the answer increments by 1.\n\nWait, but in the code for count=2:\n\nThe loop runs for j_val=1:\n\ncount becomes 1, answer increases by 1.\n\nThen j_val becomes 2, which is larger than count (1), so loop stops.\n\nThus, total 1.\n\nThen i=3:\n\nCheck 12 divided by 3:\n\n12 mod3=0 \u2192 temp=12/3=4 \u2192 count=1 (since divided once).\n\nWait, original_n was 12, after dividing by 2 twice, original_n becomes 12/(2^2)=3. Then in the next iteration i=3:\n\ntemp = original_n (3) \u2192 divided by 3 once \u2192 count=1.\n\nThus, processing count=1:\n\nj_val=1 \u2192 count -1=0 \u2192 yes. count becomes 0, answer +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nThus, after i=3, answer_second is 1 (from i=2) +1 (from i=3) \u2192 total 2.\n\nThen, after the loop, original_n is 3/3=1 \u2192 so no remaining factor.\n\nThus, answer_second is 2.\n\nThird step: the string is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case where the second step's answer is 10 (so the string is \"10\"), which has no A/B \u2192 \"No\".\n\nIf the second step's answer is 65 (string \"65\"), still no.\n\nIf the second step's answer is 10 (string \"10\"), no.\n\nOnly if the answer is something like \"AB\" or \"A1B\", but since it's a number, it can't have letters. So the third step will always output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the third Java program's code, it's correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should handle all steps correctly.\n\nNow, writing the final code with all these considerations."
