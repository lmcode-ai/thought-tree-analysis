    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_579_A) takes an integer n from input, converts it to binary, counts the number of 1's, and outputs that count. So the input is a number, the output is the count of 1 bits.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x. If x is 1, it outputs 0; else, it outputs 1. Wait, actually looking at the code: the result is 1 if bool is false (so when x !=1), else 0. Wait, let me check again. The code says:\n\nbool = x ==1 ? true : false; so if x is 1, bool is true. Then result is !bool ? 1 :0. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0; So if !bool is true (i.e., bool is false, so x !=1), then result is 1. Else (x is 1), result is 0. So the output is 1 when x is not 1, 0 when it is. So the second program's output is 1 if the input is not 1, else 0.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC174_C) takes an integer K, and returns some value. Let me parse its logic. The solve function:\n\nFirst, if K is even or divisible by 5, return -1. Then, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Then compute the minimal n where 10^n \u2261 1 mod (K). The answer is that n, or -1 if conditions not met.\n\nWait, the code's steps:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen, if K mod 7 is 0 \u2192 divide K by 7.\n\nThen multiply K by 9 \u2192 K = K *9 ?\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nThen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nWait, but the code's K after division by 7 is multiplied by 9. So the problem is to find the minimal n where 10^n mod (9*K/7) (if divisible by 7) equals 1, but only if K wasn't even or divisible by 5. Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal length of a number consisting of all 9's divisible by K. But the code's logic might be part of that.\n\nBut regardless, the third program takes an integer K (from input) and outputs the result of solve(). The output is the answer.\n\nNow, the sequence is: the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So the overall flow is:\n\nInput \u2192 first program \u2192 output A \u2192 second program takes A as input \u2192 outputs B \u2192 third program takes B as input \u2192 outputs the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (the first program's input), process through all three steps, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the first program's input, which is an integer n).\n\n2. Compute the first step's result (count of 1's in binary of n).\n\n3. Use that count as input to the second step, which will output 0 if the count is 1, else 1.\n\n4. Take that result (0 or 1) as the input K for the third program.\n\n5. Compute the third program's result based on that K, and output it.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is K, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is either 0 or 1. Let me see:\n\nWait, the second program's input is x (the first program's output). So if the first program's output is, say, 3, then the second program's input is 3, so the second program outputs 1 (since x is not 1). Then the third program takes that 1 as K.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is K. Let me see:\n\nThe third program's input is read via readInt(), which reads an integer from standard input. So the second program's output is the input to the third program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOriginal input (n) \u2192 first program \u2192 output A (count of 1's in binary of n).\n\nThen, second program takes A as input, outputs B (0 if A is 1, else 1).\n\nThird program takes B as input, and computes its result based on B.\n\nSo in the Fortran program, I need to:\n\n- Read the initial n (from input).\n\n- Compute A (the count of 1's in binary of n).\n\n- Compute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\n- Compute the third program's result using B as K.\n\n- Output that result.\n\nNow, let's think about each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst step: count the number of 1's in binary of n.\n\nIn Fortran, to do this, we can take the input integer, loop while it's greater than 0, and count the remainder when divided by 2, then divide by 2 each time.\n\nSecond step: B is 0 if A is 1, else 1. So B = 1 - (A ==1). Or, in code: if A ==1 then B=0 else B=1.\n\nThird step: compute the third program's result with K = B.\n\nWait, but the third program's code has some conditions. Let's see:\n\nThe third program's solve function:\n\nFirst, check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nBut if K is 0 or 1, let's see:\n\nWait, the input to the third program is B, which is either 0 or 1.\n\nWait, B can be 0 or 1. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: B is 0.\n\nThen, in the third program's code, K is 0. Then, the first condition: K mod 2 is 0 \u2192 so return -1.\n\nSo the third program's output would be -1.\n\nCase 2: B is 1.\n\nThen K is 1. Let's see:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5? 1 is not even, nor divisible by 5. So proceed.\n\nThen check if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 1 mod7 is 1, so no. So K remains 1.\n\nMultiply by 9 \u2192 K becomes 9.\n\nThen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod 9 ==1.\n\nWait, 10 mod9 is 1. So 10^ans mod9 is 1^ans mod9 =1 mod9. So remainder is 1 when ans is 1. So the loop:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod9 =1. So remainder ==1 \u2192 loop exits. So ans is 1. So the third program returns 1.\n\nSo for B=1, the third program returns 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program must read the initial n, compute A (count of 1's in binary of n), compute B as 0 if A is 1 else 1, then compute the third program's result with K=B, and output that.\n\nNow, let's code each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part: count the 1's in binary of n.\n\nIn Fortran, to do this:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nLoop while n >0:\n\ncount = count + mod(n,2)\n\nn = n /2\n\nWait, but mod(n,2) gives 0 or 1, so adding that to count each time.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond part: B = 0 if count ==1 else 1.\n\nThird part: compute the third program's result with K = B.\n\nNow, the third program's logic:\n\nFunction solve(K):\n\nif K mod2 ==0 or K mod5 ==0 \u2192 return -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nthen find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1.\n\nWait, but in code, the remainder is computed as follows:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nWait, let me retrace the code's steps:\n\nremainder = 10 mod K \u2192 but in code:\n\nremainder = 10 % K \u2192 but in Fortran, mod(10, K) ?\n\nWait, in Java, 10%K is the remainder. But in Fortran, mod(a,b) gives the remainder with the same sign as b. But since K is positive here (since in the third program, K is input as an integer, but in our case, K is either 0 or 1, but let's see).\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, K is read as an integer. So in the case when K is 0, the first condition (even or divisible by 5) is true, so returns -1. So for K=0, the result is -1.\n\nFor K=1:\n\nThe first condition is not met (since 1 is not even or divisible by 5). Then, check if K mod7 is 0 \u2192 1 mod7 is 1 \u2192 no. So K remains 1. Then multiply by 9 \u2192 K becomes 9.\n\nThen, ans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod9 \u2192 1. Since remainder is 1, the loop stops. So ans is 1. So the result is 1.\n\nSo in code, the third part's logic for K=1 is returning 1.\n\nNow, in Fortran, to code the third part's logic.\n\nWe need to write a function that takes K (the B value from the second step) and returns the result as per the third program's logic.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the third part's function:\n\nFUNCTION compute_third(K) RESULT(result)\n  INTEGER :: K, result\n  ! ... code here ...\nEND FUNCTION\n\nInside:\n\nFirst, check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, return -1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 if yes, divide K by7.\n\nMultiply K by9 \u2192 new K is K *9.\n\nThen find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod new_K) ==1.\n\nWait, but the code in Java does:\n\nremainder = 10 mod K (initially K is the new K after division and multiplication?)\n\nWait, let me retrace the code steps again:\n\nAfter K is divided by7 (if applicable), then K is multiplied by9. So the new K is (original K after division) *9.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nSo the new K is (K /7) *9 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) then K = K/7.\n\nThen, regardless, K *=9.\n\nSo the new K is (K /7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nWait, for example, if original K was 7, then after division by7, K becomes 1, then multiplied by9 \u2192 9.\n\nSo the new K is (K divided by7 if divisible) then multiplied by9.\n\nSo in code, the new K is (K / (7^a)) *9, where a is 1 if divisible by7, else 0.\n\nWait, but the code only divides once by7 if divisible. So even if K was 49, it would divide once to 7, then multiply by9 \u2192 63.\n\nHmm, but the problem's logic may require that, but in any case, the code is as written.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the initial checks:\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n   result = -1\n\n   return\n\nend if\n\nif (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nThen, compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1.\n\nWait, but in the code, the remainder is initialized as 10 mod K (since remainder =10%K).\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nans =1\n\nremainder =10 mod K (since 10%K in Java is the remainder).\n\nThen, while remainder !=1:\n\nans +=1\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) mod K\n\nLoop until remainder is 1.\n\nSo the minimal ans is found.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for this part would be:\n\nans =1\n\nremainder = mod(10, K)\n\ndo while (remainder /=1)\n\n   ans = ans +1\n\n   remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nend do\n\nresult = ans\n\nBut we have to handle cases where K is 0 or 1, but in our scenario, K is either 0 or 1 (from B's possible values).\n\nWait, but when K is 0, the first condition (even or divisible by5) is true (since 0 mod2 is 0), so returns -1.\n\nSo in the function compute_third(K):\n\nFirst, check if K is 0 or even or divisible by5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nWait, the first condition is if K mod2 ==0 OR K mod5 ==0 \u2192 so even or divisible by5.\n\nSo for K=0, mod2 is 0 \u2192 yes, so returns -1.\n\nFor K=1:\n\nCheck mod2: 1 mod2 is 1 \u2192 no. mod5 is 1 mod5 \u21921 \u2192 no. So proceed.\n\nCheck mod7: 1 mod7 is 1 \u2192 no. So K remains 1.\n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 K becomes 9.\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is mod(10,9) \u21921.\n\nSince remainder is 1, loop doesn't execute. So ans is 1 \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\nRead the initial n (integer).\n\nCompute the count of 1's in binary (A).\n\nCompute B = 0 if A ==1 else 1.\n\nCompute the third program's result with K=B.\n\nOutput that result.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\ninteger :: n, count, B, result\n\nRead n from input:\n\nread*, n\n\nCompute count:\n\ncount =0\n\ntemp = n\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   count = count + mod(temp,2)\n\n   temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nThen B:\n\nif (count ==1) then\n\n   B =0\n\nelse\n\n   B=1\n\nend if\n\nThen compute result = compute_third(B)\n\nThen print result.\n\nNow, the function compute_third(K):\n\nFUNCTION compute_third(K) RESULT(res)\n\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: K\n\n  INTEGER :: res, temp_K, ans, remainder\n\n  ! Check if K is even or divisible by5\n\n  if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n     res = -1\n\n     return\n\n  end if\n\n  temp_K = K\n\n  ! Check if divisible by7\n\n  if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n     temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n  end if\n\n  temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n  ! Now compute ans\n\n  ans =1\n\n  remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n  do while (remainder /=1)\n\n     ans = ans +1\n\n     remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n  end do\n\n  res = ans\n\nEND FUNCTION compute_third\n\nWait, but what if temp_K is zero? Well, in our case, K is either 0 or 1.\n\nWait, when K is 0, the first condition is met (even), so returns -1. So temp_K is not used in that case.\n\nWhen K is 1:\n\ntemp_K starts as 1. Not divisible by7 \u2192 temp_K remains 1. Multiply by9 \u2192 9.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWait, but in the code above, temp_K is initialized as K, but in the case where K is 1, the code proceeds.\n\nWait, but in the function, after checking the first condition (even or divisible by5), which for K=1 is false, then temp_K is set to K (1). Then check mod7: 1 mod7 is 1 \u2192 no division. So temp_K becomes 1*9=9.\n\nThen the loop proceeds as before.\n\nSo the function should work.\n\nPutting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nThe program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, count, B, result\n\n  !

Well, in our scenario, K is either 0 or 1. For K=0, the first condition is met (even), so returns -1. So the function is okay.\n\nTesting possible cases:\n\nTest case 1: Let's say the input to the first program is 3 (binary 11 \u2192 count is 2 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 third program's K is 1 \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo the output should be 1.\n\nAnother test case: input n=1 (binary 1 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third program's K is 0 \u2192 returns -1. So output is -1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2 (binary 10 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third program returns -1.\n\nWait, n=2 \u2192 binary is 10 \u2192 count is 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third program's K is 0 \u2192 returns -1. So output is -1.\n\nAnother test case: n=0 \u2192 binary is 0 \u2192 count is 0 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 third program returns 1.\n\nWait, n=0: the first program's code would have n=0, so the loop doesn't run (since n starts at 0). So s is empty. Then the count is 0. So B is 1 (since count is not 1). So third program's K is 1 \u2192 returns 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=7 \u2192 binary 111 \u2192 count 3 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 third program returns 1.\n\nWait, third program's K is 1 \u2192 returns 1.\n\nWait, but let me see for K=1, the third program's code:\n\nYes, as before, returns 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1 \u2192 first program's output is 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third program returns -1.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle these cases.\n\nWait, but in the first program's code, when n is 0, the loop doesn't run, so s is empty. The count is 0, so B is 1 \u2192 third program's K is 1 \u2192 returns 1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n= -1? Wait, but the original Java code uses Scanner.nextInt(), which would read negative numbers, but the problem probably expects n to be a non-negative integer. Since the problem's first program is converting to binary, which for negative numbers would be two's complement, but the code in Java would process it as a negative number. However, the problem's original code may assume n is non-negative. Since the user hasn't specified, but in the problem's context, perhaps n is a positive integer. But the code in Fortran should handle it as per the original Java code.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, n is read as an int. If n is negative, then the loop would run, but since n is divided by 2 each time, but in Java, division of a negative number by 2 is towards zero. So for example, n = -3 \u2192 binary would be ... but the code would process it as follows:\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose n is -3.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx = (-3) %2 \u2192 in Java, the remainder has the same sign as the dividend. So -3 mod2 is -1. So x is -1 \u2192 but when added to the string, it's \"-1\".\n\nWait, but the code appends x as a string. So the code would produce a string with negative digits, which is not a standard binary representation. But the problem's first Java program may expect n to be a non-negative integer. Since the user hasn't specified, but the problem's first program is probably intended for positive integers. So perhaps the Fortran code can proceed as written, but the user's input is expected to be non-negative.\n\nAssuming that the input is non-negative, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the first part, when n is 0, the loop doesn't run, so count is 0 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 third program returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1 \u2192 count is 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third program returns -1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3 \u2192 count 2 \u2192 B is 1 \u2192 third program returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third returns -1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=4 (binary 100 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 B is 0 \u2192 third returns -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let me check the function compute_third for K=1:\n\nYes, returns 1.\n\nFor K=0 \u2192 returns -1.\n\nFor K=7 \u2192 but in our scenario, B can only be 0 or 1, so K=7 is not possible here. But the function is correct for all K.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work."
