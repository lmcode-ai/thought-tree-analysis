    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC107_D) reads input N and an array of integers. It then uses a Task class's solve method to compute some value, which is printed. The solve method seems to involve sorting the array, some binary search, and a Fenwick tree (BIT) for counting. The output here is an integer.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n, processes it with solve(n), which calculates (n//3)*2 plus 1 if n mod 3 isn't zero. The output here is another integer.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_49_A) reads a string, checks the last non-space and non-question mark character, and outputs YES or NO based on whether it's a vowel (including y). The output here is a string.\n\nThe key is to chain these three steps in Fortran without I/O in the middle. The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But in Fortran, I need to read the input once at the start, process all steps, and output the final result.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is the result of solve(arr), which is an integer. Then the second program takes an integer n, which would be that result. The third takes the output of the second, which is another integer, but the third expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the second Java program's solve function takes an integer n and outputs a number. The third program expects a string input. So there's a problem here. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. The user said the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is an integer, which is the input to the second program. The second's output is an integer, which is the input to the third. But the third expects a string. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the sequence.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code again:\n\nFirst program's output is the result of solve(arr), which is an integer. The second program's main reads an integer n from input (using BufferedReader, which reads from stdin). The third program's main reads a string from stdin. So the sequence is:\n\nInput to first program is N and array. Its output is an integer (let's say X). Then the second program takes X as its input (so it reads X as n). The second program's output is another integer Y. Then the third program takes Y as input, but the third program expects a string. That's impossible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the three Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, where the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the third program expects a string, so the second's output must be a string. Wait, looking at the second Java program's output: it prints a number, which is an integer. So the third program would read that as a string? Like, if the second outputs \"5\", then the third reads \"5\" as the string, but then the third checks the last character. But the third program's code is looking for the last non-space and non-? character. So if the input is \"5\", then the last character is '5', which is not a vowel, so output NO. But that's possible. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is an integer (like 10), second takes that as n (so n=10, outputs (10//3)*2 +1 (since 10 mod3 is 1, so 3*2 +1=7?), so output 7. Then third program takes \"7\" as input, which is a string, so the last character is '7', which is not a vowel, so output NO.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result (the third's output).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and array from input (first program's input).\n\n2. Compute the first program's solve(arr) to get X.\n\n3. Compute the second program's solve(X) to get Y.\n\n4. Compute the third program's solve(Y) to get the final output (YES/NO).\n\nWait, but the third program's solve is not a function. Let me check the third Java code:\n\nThird program's main reads a string s via nextLine(). So the third program's input is a string. The second program's output is an integer (like 7), so when the third program runs, it would read that as a string \"7\\n\" (assuming the second program's output is printed as an integer followed by a newline). So in the Fortran program, after getting Y from the second step, we need to pass it as a string to the third step's processing.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran program, all steps are done in memory. So the steps are:\n\n- Read N and array (from user input).\n\n- Run first Java's solve(arr) to get X.\n\n- Run second's solve(X) to get Y.\n\n- Run third's processing on the string representation of Y (as a string, like \"Y\" where Y is the integer from step 2).\n\nWait, but the third program's processing is based on the last non-space and non-? character in the input string. So the input to the third step is the string representation of Y (as a number, e.g., \"7\" or \"123\").\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after getting Y (integer), we need to convert it to a string, then process that string as per the third program's logic.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read N and array from input.\n\n2. Compute X via the first program's logic.\n\n3. Compute Y via the second's formula: Y = (X // 3) * 2 + (1 if X mod3 !=0 else 0). Wait, the second Java's solve function is:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n    System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n}\n\nWait, let's see: (n/3) is integer division. For example, n=10: 10/3 is 3, so 3*2=6, plus 1 (since 10 mod3 is 1, so not zero). So total 7. So the formula is (n div 3)*2 + (if n mod3 !=0 then 1 else 0). So Y = (X//3)*2 + (1 if X mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nWait, but in code, it's written as (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1). So yes, that's correct.\n\n4. Then, take Y, convert to a string (as a character string, e.g., \"7\"), then process that string as per the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's logic is: look for the last character in the string that is not a space or '?'. Then check if that character is a vowel (lowercase, including y). So in Fortran, we need to process the string of Y's value.\n\nSo putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n- Read N and array (from stdin).\n\n- Compute X via the first Java's solve logic (the complex part with binary search and Fenwick tree).\n\n- Compute Y via the second's formula.\n\n- Convert Y to a string (as a character array or string variable).\n\n- Process that string to find the last non-space and non-? character, check if it's a vowel, output YES or NO.\n\nNow, the main challenge is translating the first Java program's solve method into Fortran. Let's look at that code again.\n\nThe first Java's solve method:\n\npublic int solve(int[] arr) {\n    int n = arr.length;\n    int[] sorted = Arrays.copyOf(arr, n);\n    Arrays.sort(sorted);\n    long total = (long) n * (n + 1) / 2;\n    int l = 0, r = n - 1;\n    while (l < r) {\n        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;\n        int target = sorted[mid];\n        int cur = 0;\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long[] bit = new long[2 * n + 2];\n        for (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cur += arr[i] <= target ? 1 : -1;\n            for (int x = cur + n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n            for (int x = cur + n; x > 0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x];\n        }\n        if (cnt >= total / 2 + 1) r = mid;\n        else l = mid + 1;\n    }\n    return sorted[l];\n}\n\nThis is a binary search over the sorted array. The binary search is looking for the smallest element where the count of some condition is at least half of total (total is n*(n+1)/2). The condition involves a Fenwick Tree (BIT) to track the count.\n\nBreaking down the steps:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is used to count the number of elements up to a certain point. The code initializes the BIT array (size 2n+2). The first loop (for x = n+1 ...) seems to be initializing the BIT? Wait, perhaps the BIT is being initialized with some initial values. Wait, the loop is for x starting at n+1, and increments by x & -x (the least significant bit). But the code is doing bit[x]++ for those positions. Not sure exactly what that does. Maybe it's part of the BIT's initial setup?\n\nWait, the Fenwick Tree here is used to track the cumulative count of some values. The code's logic is a bit complex. Let me try to understand:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree (BIT) is used to compute the number of elements in the array up to a certain point. The variable 'cur' is the current cumulative sum, which is incremented by 1 if arr[i] <= target, else -1. The 'cur' starts at 0 and is updated for each element. For each step, after updating 'cur', the code updates the BIT by adding 1 at position (cur + n +1). Then, it queries the BIT from position (cur +n) down to 0 to get the count. Wait, perhaps the BIT is storing the frequency of the 'cur' values, and the query is to find how many times a certain value has been seen?\n\nAlternatively, the code is using the BIT to track the number of times a certain 'cur' value has occurred, and then for each step, it's counting how many previous 'cur's are less than or equal to the current 'cur'? Not sure. This part is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the number of pairs (i,j) where the cumulative sum up to j is >= the cumulative sum up to i. The binary search is looking for the minimal target where the count of such pairs is at least half of the total possible pairs (total is n*(n+1)/2). The total is the total number of pairs (i,j) with i <= j, which is indeed n(n+1)/2.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree here is used to track the cumulative counts. The 'cur' variable is the current cumulative sum. For each element, we update the BIT by adding 1 at position (cur + n +1). Then, the query is to get the sum from 1 to (cur +n). Wait, perhaps the BIT is 1-based, and the positions are offset by n+1 to handle negative values of 'cur'? Because 'cur' can be negative if many elements are above the target.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree's indices are from 1 to 2n+1 (since the array is size 2n+2, indices 0 to 2n+1). The initial loop for x = n+1 to the end (bit.length is 2n+2, so indices up to 2n+1) and increments by x & -x. Wait, the initial loop is for x starting at n+1, and for each x, it increments bit[x] by 1. But why? Maybe that's part of the initialization. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, but in the Java code, that loop is part of the setup before processing the array.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial loop is to set the BIT's initial state. Let me think: the Fenwick Tree is used to track the number of times a certain 'cur' value has been seen. The 'cur' starts at 0, and for each element, it's updated. The code first initializes the BIT with some initial value. The first loop (for x = n+1 ...) is perhaps setting the initial position for cur=0? Because when cur is 0, the position would be 0 + n +1 = n+1. So the initial loop is adding 1 to that position? Wait, the first loop is for x from n+1 to the end of the BIT array, stepping by x & -x. Wait, that's not the standard Fenwick Tree update. Maybe that's a mistake in the code? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial loop is a mistake, but in the code, the first loop is:\n\nfor (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nThis is incrementing the bit array at positions starting from n+1, but the step is x & -x, which is the least significant bit. So for example, if n is 5, then n+1 is 6. The loop would start at 6, then add 2 (since 6 in binary is 110, so LSB is 2), so next x is 8, then 8's LSB is 8, so next x is 16, etc. But the array is of size 2n+2, so for n=5, the array is 12 elements (indices 0-11). So 6+2=8, then 8+8=16 which is beyond the array. So the loop would only run once for x=6. So that's adding 1 to bit[6]. Not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial loop is a mistake and the code is incorrect. But since the user provided this code, I have to translate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial loop is supposed to initialize the BIT with some initial value. Maybe the code is supposed to start with the initial 'cur' being 0, so the first position is cur +n+1 = 0 +n+1 = n+1. So the initial loop is adding 1 to that position. But the loop is written as for x starting at n+1 and adding x & -x each time. So for x = n+1, the step is x & -x, which is the LSB of x. For example, if n+1 is even, like 6 (binary 110), LSB is 2, so next x is 6+2=8, but if the array is only up to 2n+1, then for n=5, 2n+1 is 11, so 8 is within the array. Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Maybe the initial loop is a mistake, but I have to translate it as per the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial loop is a mistake and the code should have a different initialization. But since I have to translate the code as given, I'll proceed.\n\nThe main steps for the solve function are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Binary search over the sorted array to find the minimal element where the count of some condition is at least half of total.\n\nThe condition is computed using the Fenwick Tree. The Fenwick Tree is used to track the number of times a certain 'cur' value has been seen. The 'cur' is the cumulative sum of 1 or -1 based on whether the current element is <= target.\n\nThe code's logic for the Fenwick Tree is:\n\nInitialize the BIT array (size 2n+2). The first loop (for x = n+1 ...) is part of the initialization. Then, for each element in the array:\n\n- Update 'cur' by adding 1 if arr[i] <= target, else subtract 1.\n\n- Update the BIT by adding 1 at position (cur + n +1).\n\n- Query the BIT for the sum from 1 to (cur +n). The query is done by looping from x = cur +n down, subtracting LSB each time, and accumulating the bit[x] values.\n\nThe 'cnt' variable accumulates this sum over all elements. Wait, no, the code's loop for the elements is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    update cur\n\n    update the BIT by adding 1 at (cur +n+1)\n\n    then, query the BIT from 1 to (cur +n) and add that to cnt.\n\nWait, the code's lines after updating cur are:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n +1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nThen, for the query:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n; x >0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x];\n\nWait, the first loop is an update to the BIT. The second loop is a query. The standard Fenwick Tree update and query functions are usually implemented with loops that add or subtract the LSB. So the update is adding 1 to the position (cur +n+1), and the query is summing from 1 to (cur +n). The way the loops are written here is a bit different from standard implementations, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree here is 1-based? The indices go from 1 to 2n+1 (since the array is 2n+2 elements, indices 0 to 2n+1). The initial loop is adding 1 to positions starting at n+1, but that's unclear.\n\nThis is quite complex. To translate this into Fortran, I need to replicate the same logic.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with any lower bound. To make it easier, perhaps use 1-based arrays.\n\nThe steps for the solve function in Fortran:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute total = n*(n+1)/2.\n\n3. Binary search between l=0 and r = n-1.\n\n4. For each mid, compute target = sorted[mid].\n\n5. Initialize the Fenwick Tree (bit array) of size 2n+2 (indices 1 to 2n+2? Or 0-based? Need to check).\n\nWait, in Java, the array is 0-based. The Fenwick Tree in the code is declared as long[2*n+2], so indices 0 to 2n+1. The loops in the code are using 0-based indices.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps it's better to use 1-based arrays, so adjust accordingly.\n\nThe initial loop in the Fenwick Tree setup:\n\nfor (int x = n +1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo x = n+1, size(bit), x and -x (but in Fortran, the step can't be variable like that). Wait, the step is x & -x, which is the least significant bit. So the loop increments x by its LSB each time. This is a bit tricky in Fortran. Maybe need to use a while loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial loop is a mistake and the code is incorrect, but I have to translate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial loop is supposed to initialize the Fenwick Tree's root nodes? Not sure. Let's proceed.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree's update and query functions are implemented with loops. The update for position pos is done by adding 1 to all positions reachable by adding the LSB of pos. The query is done by summing all positions reachable by subtracting the LSB from pos until 0.\n\nWait, the code's update loop is:\n\nfor (int x = pos; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nSimilarly, the query loop is:\n\nsum =0\n\nfor (int x = pos; x>0; x -= x & -x) sum += bit[x]\n\nSo in Fortran, the update and query can be implemented with loops.\n\nPutting this together, the solve function in Fortran would need to:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Binary search between l and r.\n\n- For each mid, compute target, then compute the Fenwick Tree steps.\n\nThis is going to be quite involved. Let's outline the steps in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the main program will read N and the array. Then compute X via the first program's logic, then Y via the second's formula, then process Y as a string for the third step.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's solve function.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is read as an integer array. Let's say we have an array arr(1:N).\n\nSorting the array can be done with a sort routine. Fortran has the Mergesort or other methods. Alternatively, use the built-in sort function.\n\nThen, the binary search loop:\n\nl = 1, r = N (since arrays are 1-based here). Wait, in Java, the original code uses l=0 and r = n-1 (0-based). So in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, the indices would be 1 to N. So l starts at 1, r at N.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the sorted array is 0-based, so the binary search is between 0 and n-1. So in Fortran, the sorted array is 1-based, so the indices are 1 to N. So l starts at 1, r at N.\n\nThe loop continues while l < r.\n\nmid = l + (r - l)/2 (integer division).\n\ntarget = sorted(mid).\n\nThen, the Fenwick Tree steps.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree (bit array) has size 2*N + 2. Since in Java it's 2*n+2 elements (0-based), in Fortran, perhaps we can make it 1-based with size 2*N +2, indices 1 to 2*N+2.\n\nWait, but in Java, the array is 2*n+2 elements (indices 0 to 2n+1). So in Fortran, to mirror that, perhaps the array is 0-based, but Fortran doesn't support that. Alternatively, use 1-based with size 2*N +2, but adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices by +1. For example, in Java, the loop starts at x = n+1 (0-based), so in Fortran, it would be x = n+2 (since 1-based). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the Fenwick Tree array is 1-based with size 2*N +2. So indices 1 to 2*N+2.\n\nThe initial loop in Java is for x from n+1 (0-based) to bit.length (which is 2n+2, so up to 2n+1). So in Fortran, the equivalent would be x from (n+1 +1) = n+2 to (2n+2) (since 0-based becomes 1-based). Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nJava's Fenwick array is 0-based, size 2n+2. So indices 0 to 2n+1.\n\nIn Fortran, if we make it 1-based, the indices would be 1 to 2n+2. So the initial loop in Java:\n\nfor (int x = n+1; x < bit.length; x += ... )\n\nIn Fortran, the starting x would be n+2 (since Java's n+1 is 0-based, so in 1-based it's n+2?), but the upper limit is 2n+2 (since the array is 1-based with size 2n+2). Wait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based arrays in Fortran by declaring with lower bound 0. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, you can declare an array as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2*N+1) :: bit\n\nThen, the indices would be 0-based, matching the Java code. That might be easier.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nallocate the array as bit(0:2*N+1)\n\nThen, the initial loop:\n\ndo x = n+1, 2*N+1, x & bset(x) (but how to compute x & -x?)\n\nWait, in Fortran, the bitwise operations are available via intrinsic functions. For example, iand(x, -x) would give the LSB. But in Fortran, the negative numbers are in two's complement, so -x is the two's complement. Wait, but in Fortran, the bitwise operations may have different behavior for negative numbers. Hmm, perhaps better to compute the LSB as x and -x, but need to ensure that it's treated as an integer.\n\nAlternatively, compute the LSB as x and not( x +1 ), but that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to compute the LSB.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written with loops that handle the LSB steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree update for a position pos is done by:\n\ndo while (pos <= 2*N+1)\n\n   bit(pos) = bit(pos) + 1\n\n   pos = pos + lsb(pos)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the original code's update is adding 1 to each position along the path. Wait, the original code's update loop is:\n\nfor (int x = pos; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nSo in Fortran, for a given pos, the loop would start at x=pos, then add x & -x each time until exceeding the array size.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger function lsb(x)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: x\n\n   lsb = iand(x, -x)\n\nend function\n\nThen, the update loop would be:\n\nx = pos\n\ndo while (x <= 2*N+1)\n\n   bit(x) = bit(x) + 1\n\n   x = x + lsb(x)\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly, the query for a position pos is:\n\nsum =0\n\nx = pos\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n   sum = sum + bit(x)\n\n   x = x - lsb(x)\n\nend do\n\nSo the Fenwick Tree functions can be implemented with these loops.\n\nNow, putting this into the solve function.\n\nThe solve function in Fortran would need to:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Initialize l and r.\n\n- Binary search loop.\n\nInside each iteration of the binary search:\n\n- Compute mid, target.\n\n- Initialize the Fenwick Tree (bit array) to zero.\n\n- Run the initial loop (the one in the Java code's first loop for x = n+1 ...). Wait, in the Java code, before processing the array elements, there's a loop that runs for x from n+1 to the end of the bit array, adding 1 to each x's position. So in Fortran:\n\ndo x = n+1, 2*N+1, lsb(x) ?\n\nWait, no. The original loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int x = n +1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is:\n\nx starts at n+1 (0-based), and increments by x & -x each time, until exceeding the array's upper bound (2*N+1).\n\nBut how to implement this loop in Fortran?\n\nWe can use a while loop:\n\nx = n+1\n\ndo while (x <= 2*N+1)\n\n   bit(x) = bit(x) +1\n\n   x = x + lsb(x)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this would only process the first x, then add the LSB each time. For example, if x starts at n+1, then next x is n+1 + lsb(n+1), etc. But the original Java code's loop is written as a for loop with step x += x & -x. So the same as this while loop.\n\nSo that's the initial setup.\n\nThen, the main loop over the array elements:\n\ncur =0\n\ncnt =0\n\ndo i =1, N\n\n   if (arr(i) <= target) then\n\n      cur = cur +1\n\n   else\n\n      cur = cur -1\n\n   end if\n\n   pos = cur + N +1\n\n   call update_bit(pos)\n\n   pos_query = cur + N\n\n   cnt = cnt + query_bit(pos_query)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the update and query functions need to be implemented as per the Fenwick Tree steps.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after updating cur, the code does:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n +1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nWhich is the update step for the Fenwick Tree. So in Fortran, this is the update function for position (cur + N +1).\n\nThen, the query is for the sum up to (cur + N). The query is done by looping from that position down, subtracting LSB each time, and accumulating the bit values.\n\nSo the code for each element would be:\n\ncur is updated.\n\nThen, call the update function for pos = cur + N +1.\n\nThen, call the query function for pos = cur + N, and add the result to cnt.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the query is done by:\n\nfor (int x = cur +n; x>0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x]\n\nSo the query is summing from x = cur +n down to 0, adding the bit[x] each step.\n\nThus, the query function returns the sum up to pos.\n\nSo in Fortran, the query function would return the sum.\n\nPutting this together, the code for each element is:\n\ncur = cur + (if arr(i) <= target then 1 else -1)\n\ncall update_bit( cur + N +1 )\n\ncnt = cnt + query_bit( cur + N )\n\nWait, but the initial Fenwick Tree setup (the first loop) is done before processing the elements. So the steps are:\n\nInitialize bit array to 0.\n\nRun the initial loop (the one adding 1 to certain positions).\n\nThen process each element, updating cur and the Fenwick Tree, and accumulating the query results into cnt.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the Fenwick Tree is initialized with the initial loop, then for each element, the update and query are done.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nallocate bit(0:2*N+1)\n\nbit = 0\n\ncall initial_setup(n, bit)\n\ncur =0\n\ncnt =0\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   ... process element ...\n\nend do\n\nThe initial_setup function would be the loop that runs the initial loop.\n\nNow, the binary search loop:\n\nThe binary search continues until l < r.\n\nAt each step, after computing cnt, if cnt >= total/2 +1, set r=mid, else l=mid+1.\n\nFinally, return sorted(l).\n\nNow, the sorted array in Fortran is 1-based. So after sorting, the first element is sorted(1), last is sorted(N).\n\nNow, the first Java program's solve function returns sorted(l), which is the element at position l in the sorted array.\n\nNow, the second step is to compute Y = (X //3)*2 + (1 if X mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with negative numbers. Since X is the result of the first step, which is an integer, and assuming it's non-negative (since it's an element of the input array which is read as integers, but the problem may allow any integers?), but the code may handle it.\n\nThe formula is Y = (X /3)*2 + (1 if mod(X,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nWait, in Java, n%3 ==0 ?0:1. So if X mod3 is 0, add 0, else add 1. So Y = (X//3)*2 + (1 if X mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, mod(X,3) gives the remainder. So:\n\nif (mod(X,3) ==0) then\n\n   Y = (X/3)*2\n\nelse\n\n   Y = (X/3)*2 +1\n\nend if\n\nThird step: process Y as a string.\n\nThe third Java program reads a string, then finds the last character that is not a space or '?', then checks if it's a vowel (a,e,i,o,u,y, lowercase).\n\nIn Fortran, to process Y as a string, we need to convert the integer Y to a string. Then process that string.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') Y\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces (if any).\n\nThen, process the string s to find the last non-space and non-? character.\n\nLoop from the end of the string backward until a character that is not ' ' or '?' is found.\n\nOnce found, convert to lowercase (if uppercase) and check if it's a vowel.\n\nIn Fortran, characters are case-sensitive. So need to check if the character is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Convert Y to a string s.\n\n2. Find the last character in s that is not ' ' or '?'.\n\n3. If none found (unlikely, since Y is a number, so the string would have digits and possibly a minus sign?), but assuming the input is such that there is at least one non-space and non-? character.\n\n4. Convert the character to lowercase (if it's uppercase).\n\n5. Check if it is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u,y).\n\n6. Output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe main program will:\n\n- Read N and the array.\n\n- Compute X via the first program's solve function.\n\n- Compute Y via the second's formula.\n\n- Convert Y to a string.\n\n- Process the string to get the final output.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, X, Y\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nlogical :: is_vowel\n\n!

The sort routine: I used a bubble sort, which is inefficient for large N, but for the purpose of code submission, it's acceptable as long as it works. Alternatively, use a better sort, but in Fortran, the intrinsic sort can be used with the 'sort' intrinsic function. For example:\n\ncall merge_sort(sorted)\n\nBut in standard Fortran, there's no built-in sort, but you can use the 'sort' intrinsic from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module or use a library. Alternatively, use a simple sort for small N.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge sort' or another method. But for the code to work, the sort must be correct.\n\n2. The Fenwick Tree implementation: The code for the Fenwick Tree's update and query is implemented inline in the solve function. The lsb function is defined as a function.\n\n3. The LSB calculation: The lsb function uses iand(x, -x). In Fortran, the negative of a number is in two's complement, so this should work. For example, x=6 (binary 110), -x is ... in two's complement, so iand(6, -6) would be 2 (since -6 in binary is ...11111010, so AND with 6 (00000110) gives 00000010).\n\n4. The initial setup loop in the solve function: The code for the initial loop is:\n\nx = n+1\n\ndo while (x <= 2*n+1)\n\n   bit(x) = bit(x)+1\n\n   x = x + lsb(x)\n\nend do\n\nThis should replicate the Java's initial loop.\n\n5. The Fenwick Tree update and query loops are implemented inline for each element.\n\n6. The process_string subroutine loops from the end of the string backward to find the first non-space and non-? character.\n\n7. The lowercase function converts uppercase letters to lowercase.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The Fenwick Tree's size: in the solve function, the Fenwick Tree is allocated as bit(0:2*n+1). The original Java code uses 2*n+2 elements (indices 0 to 2n+1). So this is correct.\n\n- The initial setup loop: in Java, the loop starts at n+1 (0-based), so in Fortran, it's correct.\n\n- The update and query loops for each element are correctly implemented.\n\n- The binary search loop's condition: the code uses l and r as 1-based indices.\n\n- The total is computed as n*(n+1)/2, which is correct.\n\n- The final return of sorted(l) is correct since the sorted array is 1-based.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nSuppose N=1, arr = [5]. Then sorted is [5]. The binary search would have l=1, r=1, so the loop doesn't run. The solve returns 5.\n\nThen Y = (5//3)*2 +1 (since 5 mod3 is 2). 5//3 is 1, so 1*2+1=3.\n\nThen the third step processes \"3\", which is a string \"3\". The last character is '3', not a vowel \u2192 output NO.\n\nAnother test case: if the third step's input is \"apple?\", then the last non-space and non-? is 'e', which is a vowel \u2192 YES.\n\nNow, the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother possible issue: the Fenwick Tree's update and query loops may have off-by-one errors. For example, in the update, the position is cur +n +1. Since in Java, the array is 0-based, but in Fortran, the sorted array is 1-based, but the Fenwick Tree's indices are handled correctly.\n\nOverall, this should work. The code may need some adjustments for array bounds and loops, but this is the general approach."
