So better to do it manually. So the code above should work. Now, the loop in the second program's main function is:\n\ni starts at 357, and while i <= N (which is the first program's ans), do the following:\n\n- check if the current i contains '3', '5', and '7' in its digits. - if yes, increment c.\n\n- compute next_i via the transformation.\n\n- set i = next_i. Wait, but in the code, the next_i is computed as per the transformation, and the loop continues until i exceeds N.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ninteger :: N, c, current_i, next_i\n\nc = 0\n\ncurrent_i = 357\n\ndo while (current_i <= N) if (contains_3_5_7(current_i)) then\n\n      c = c + 1\n\n   end if\n\n   !",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_265_B) reads an integer n and an array of n integers. It calculates a value 'ans' by starting with arr[0]+1, then adding the absolute difference between consecutive elements plus 2 each time. The output is this ans. So this is the first step, which reads input and computes a number.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C) takes that ans as input, but wait, no\u2014 actually, the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third program then outputs its result. So the entire sequence is: input -> first program -> second -> third -> output.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is N, which is read via gi(), which is from the input. Wait, no, the second program's input is the output of the first program. Wait, the first program's output is a single integer, which is the 'ans' variable. So the second program's input is that number. Let me check the second Java program's code.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's main method: it starts by reading N via gi(), which is the first input. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's N is the first's ans. So the second program's input is a single integer, which is the first's output. Then the second program processes that and outputs its own result, which is then the input to the third program.\n\nThe third program (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n, and outputs (n divided by 3, multiplied by 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0). So the third program's input is the second's output.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is:\n\nInput (for first program) \u2192 first program's output \u2192 second program's input \u2192 second's output \u2192 third's input \u2192 third's output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and then output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array. Compute ans as arr[0]+1, then for each next element, add the absolute difference between current and previous plus 2. So the final ans is the sum.\n\nSecond program's logic is more complex. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe second program's main function:\n\n- Reads N (which is the first program's output, so in the Fortran code, this N will be the ans from the first step).\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the second program's N is read via gi(), which is from the input. So in the Fortran code, the second step's input is the first's output. So in the Fortran program, after the first step computes ans, that ans is passed to the second step's processing, not via I/O but as variables.\n\nWait, the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So all three steps are in one program, with the first handling input, the last handling output, and the middle steps processing without I/O.\n\nTherefore, the first step (Java's first program) will be the first part of the Fortran code, reading the input. The second step (Java's second program) will take the output of the first step (the ans) as its input N. Then the second step's processing will compute its own result (the count c), which is then passed to the third step (Java's third program) which computes the final output based on that c.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's output is the value of 'c', which is printed at the end. So the third program's input is that c. The third program then computes (c divided by 3)*2 + 1 if there's a remainder, etc.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read input (n and array) as per first Java program.\n\n2. Compute ans (first program's result).\n\n3. Use that ans as the input N for the second step (second Java program's processing).\n\n4. Compute the second step's result (c).\n\n5. Use that c as the input for the third step (third Java program's processing).\n\n6. Compute the final result and print it.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst step (Java's first program):\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array. Compute ans as arr[0]+1, then loop from 1 to n-1, adding |arr[i] - arr[i-1]| +2 each time.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare with 0: but maybe easier to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array starting at 1, but adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based in Fortran by declaring the array with indices 0 to n-1.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with a starting and ending index. So for n elements, we can do:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: arr\n\nBut the first step is to read n, then the array.\n\nSecond step (Java's second program):\n\nThe second program's N is the ans from first step. The second program's code is a bit more involved.\n\nThe second program's main loop starts with i=357, and counts how many numbers up to N contain 3,5,7 in their digits, and also follows some generation process. Wait, the code is a bit more complex. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nThe loop runs while i <= N. For each i, it checks if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'. If so, increment c.\n\nThen, the next i is generated by some process. The code constructs a new number by modifying the digits of the current i. The process is:\n\n- Convert i to a string s.\n\n- Then, process each digit from the end (since it's going from s.length()-1 -j, so starting from the last character and moving backward).\n\nWait, the code loops over j from 0 to s.length()-1, and for each j, the character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0, it's the last character, then j=1 is the second last, etc. So processing the digits from right to left.\n\nThe code builds a new string sb as follows:\n\n- For each character a (starting from the last digit):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if a is '3', then append '5' and set f to true.\n\n      else if a is '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n\n      else append '3'.\n\n   else:\n\n      append a as is.\n\n   After processing all digits, if f is still false, append a '3' to the end.\n\nThen, the new i is the reversed of this sb string, parsed as a long.\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuilder, and then reverses it with sb2.reverse(). Because the digits were processed from right to left, but the new number is built in a way that the next number is generated by this process.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The code is generating the next number in some sequence, and counts how many numbers up to N have all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nWait, the count c is incremented whenever the current i has all three digits present. The loop continues until i exceeds N, generating the next i each time via this transformation.\n\nThe problem is to translate this logic into Fortran.\n\nThe key steps here are:\n\n- Starting with i=357, check if it contains 3,5,7. If yes, count it.\n\n- Then generate the next i via the transformation described.\n\n- Repeat until i exceeds N.\n\nThe transformation process is the main challenge here.\n\nLet me think of how to implement the transformation in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the current i is converted to a string. Let's say s is the string representation of i.\n\nProcessing the digits from right to left (since the code loops from the end):\n\nWe need to process each digit, starting from the last character (the least significant digit), and decide how to modify it.\n\nThe algorithm for building the next number's digits:\n\nInitialize a flag f = false.\n\nFor each digit (starting from the end of s):\n\n   current digit is a.\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if a is '3', then replace it with '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if a is '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n      else (a is not 3 or 5), replace with '3'.\n\n   else:\n\n      leave a as is.\n\nAfter processing all digits, if f is still false, append a '3' to the end.\n\nThen, the new number is the reverse of this modified string, because the code appends the digits in reverse order (since the loop starts from the end and builds the string in reverse order, then reverses it again? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuilder sb. The loop processes the digits from the end (right to left), and appends each character (modified or not) to sb. So the first character added to sb is the last digit of the original number, then the second last, etc. So the sb string is the digits in reverse order (since we process from end to start). Then, when they do sb2.reverse(), which is a StringBuffer, but in the code, they create a new StringBuffer from sb, then reverse it again? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is the modified digits in the order of processing (from last digit to first). So the sb string is the modified digits in reverse order of the original. Then, when reversed again, it becomes the correct order.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the original number is 357 (string \"357\").\n\nProcessing each digit from the end (digits are '7', '5', '3').\n\nProcessing first digit (7):\n\nf is false. Since a is not 3 or 5, replace with '3'. So first character in sb is '3', f becomes true?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code's first step for a=7 (since it's the last digit):\n\nif a is '3' \u2192 no.\n\nelse if a is '5' \u2192 no.\n\nelse \u2192 append '3', and f remains false? Wait, no, the code's logic for the else case (when a is not 3 or 5):\n\nIn the code's first part (when f is false):\n\nif a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\nelse if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\nelse (a is neither 3 nor 5), append '3', but f remains false?\n\nWait, yes. So in the case of a=7 (the first digit processed, which is the last digit of the original number):\n\nThe code appends '3', and f remains false.\n\nThen, moving to the next digit (the second last digit of the original number, which is '5'):\n\nNow, since f is still false, check a=5.\n\nSo append '7', set f to true.\n\nNext digit (the first digit of the original number, '3'):\n\nNow, f is true, so append '3' as is.\n\nSo the sb after processing all digits is \"3\" (from first digit 7 \u2192 '3'), then '7' (from 5 \u2192 '7'), then '3' (from 3 \u2192 as is). So the sb is \"373\".\n\nWait, the digits were processed in reverse order (7,5,3). The first character added is '3', then '7', then '3', so the sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, the code creates a StringBuffer sb2 from sb, then reverses it. So reversing \"373\" gives \"373\", so the new i is 373.\n\nWait, but in the example, the next i would be 373. But the original i was 357. So the next step would check if 373 contains all three digits (3,5,7). It has 3 and 7 but not 5, so it wouldn't count. Hmm.\n\nBut the main point is to implement this transformation correctly in Fortran.\n\nThis is going to be a bit involved. Let's think of steps:\n\n1. Convert the current i to a string.\n\n2. Process each character from the end (right to left).\n\n3. Build the new string according to the rules.\n\n4. If the flag f was never set (i.e., all digits were not 3 or 5 except the first replacement?), then append a '3' at the end.\n\n5. Reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits from right to left, modifying as per the rules, then the final string is reversed again to form the next i.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe sb is built by appending the modified digits in the order of processing (right to left). So the first character in sb is the modified last digit of the original number, then the second last, etc. So the sb string is the modified digits in reverse order. Then, when reversed, it becomes the correct order.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the sb is the modified digits in the order of processing (right to left), then reversed again to get the correct order.\n\nWait, let me see with the example of 357:\n\nOriginal digits: 3,5,7 \u2192 string \"357\".\n\nProcessing from the end (digits 7,5,3):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false. Since it's not 3 or 5, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (5):\n\nf is still false. Since it's 5, append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is now true. So append '3' as is.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" (from 7) + \"7\" (from 5) + \"3\" (from 3) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing this gives \"373\" \u2192 so the new i is 373.\n\nWait, but the reverse of \"373\" is the same, so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: let's say the current i is 357 (the first iteration):\n\nAfter processing, the next i is 373. Then, the next iteration would process 373.\n\nBut let's see another example where the flag is not set. Suppose the current i is 333.\n\nProcessing digits from right to left (3,3,3):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false. Since it's 3, append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" (from first digit) + \"3\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"533\".\n\nReversing gives \"335\", so next i is 335.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo the steps for the transformation are:\n\n- Convert i to a string s.\n\n- Initialize f as false.\n\n- Create a new string (sb) by processing each character from the end of s to the beginning.\n\n- For each character a in reverse order:\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3', leave f as false.\n\n   else:\n\n      append a as is.\n\n- After processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3' to the end of the new string.\n\n- Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the code's process is that after building the sb, if f is false, then append '3' to the end of the sb. Then, reverse the entire string to get the next i.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter the loop over the digits, there's an if (!f) sb.append(3); \u2192 so if f is still false after processing all digits, append '3' to the end of the sb.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed to form the next i.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nThe code after the loop:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nThen, the code creates a StringBuffer sb2 from sb, then reverses it and parses as a long.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, so the sb is first modified by appending '3' if needed, then the entire sb is reversed to form the next i.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe code's steps:\n\nAfter processing all the digits (the for loop over j), the code checks if f is false. If so, appends '3' to the sb.\n\nThen, the code creates a new StringBuffer from sb (sb2), then reverses it, and parses that as the new i.\n\nWait, so the process is:\n\nThe sb is the modified digits (processed from right to left, with possible appending of '3' at the end if needed). Then, reversing the entire sb gives the next i.\n\nWait, let's take an example where f was false after processing all digits. Suppose the original number is 3333 (digits 3,3,3,3):\n\nProcessing each digit from the end (the last 3):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nappend '3'.\n\nFourth digit (3):\n\nappend '3'.\n\nSo after processing all digits, f is true, so no appending of '3'.\n\nThe sb is \"5\" followed by three '3's \u2192 \"5333\".\n\nReversing gives \"3335\", so next i is 3335.\n\nAnother example where f remains false: suppose the original number is 123.\n\nProcessing digits from right to left (3,2,1):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (2):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '2'.\n\nThird digit (1):\n\nappend '1'.\n\nSo the sb is \"521\". Reversed gives \"125\".\n\nWait, but the original number was 123, so next i is 125.\n\nWait, but in this case, the flag f was set to true because the first digit (3) was processed. So no need to append '3'.\n\nAnother example where f remains false: suppose the original number is 111.\n\nProcessing digits from right to left (1,1,1):\n\nEach digit is not 3 or 5. So for each:\n\nFirst digit (1):\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (1):\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nThird digit (1):\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all, f is still false \u2192 append '3' to the end of the sb.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" (from first digit) + \"3\" (second) + \"3\" (third) + \"3\" (appended) \u2192 \"3333\".\n\nReversing gives \"3333\", so next i is 3333.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each digit from the end of the current i's string:\n\n   process as per the rules, building the new string in reverse order (since we process from the end first).\n\n- After processing all digits, if the flag f was never set (i.e., all digits were not 3 or 5, so only replaced with 3's), then append a '3'.\n\n- The new string is then reversed to form the next i.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to implement this:\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Take the current i as a number, convert to a string.\n\n2. Process each character from the end to the beginning.\n\n3. Build the new string according to the rules.\n\n4. Check if f was set; if not, append '3'.\n\n5. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nImplementing this in Fortran requires string manipulation functions.\n\nFortran has string functions like len_trim, but for handling individual characters, we can loop through the characters.\n\nFirst, converting the number to a string. In Fortran, we can use write and read to convert between numbers and strings.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger :: i\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\nThen, process each character in s from the end to the beginning.\n\nWait, but the string may have leading spaces if the number is smaller. So better to use the 'i0' format to avoid leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'a' format to get the exact string.\n\nAlternatively, use the trim function.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the 'i0' format and then trim the string.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when writing to a string with '(i0)', it should write the number without leading spaces. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the 'i0' format writes the integer as a string without leading spaces. So the length can be determined with len_trim.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nGiven current_i (the i variable in the loop):\n\ns = string representation of current_i.\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nnew_str = ''\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, n\n\n   current_char = s(n - j + 1: n - j + 1)  ' because we process from the end (the first character is the last of s)\n\n   if .not. f then\n\n      if current_char == '3' then\n\n         new_str = new_str // '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if current_char == '5' then\n\n         new_str = new_str // '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else\n\n         new_str = new_str // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      new_str = new_str // current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   new_str = new_str // '3'\n\nend if\n\nThen, reverse the new_str to get the next_i.\n\nWait, the new_str is built by processing each character from the end of s to the beginning. So the first character added to new_str is the last character of s, then the second last, etc. So the new_str is in the order of the original's reversed digits, modified according to the rules. Then, after appending '3' if needed, we need to reverse it again to get the next i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code in Java reverses the new_str (after appending the '3' if needed) to form the next i. Because in the code, the sb is the modified string, then reversed to get the next i.\n\nWait, in the code, the next i is obtained by reversing the sb (after appending the '3' if needed). So the new_str in Fortran is the same as the sb in Java. So to get the next i, we need to reverse the new_str.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the example of 357:\n\ns is \"357\", length 3.\n\nProcessing each character from the end (positions 3,2,1):\n\nFirst character (position 3: '7'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (position 2: '5'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (position 1: '3'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo new_str is \"3\" (from 7) + \"7\" (from 5) + \"3\" (from 3) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f is true, no appending of '3'.\n\nThen, reverse new_str \u2192 \"373\" reversed is \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example where f was not set:\n\nTake the number 111 \u2192 s is \"111\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (third '1', second '1', first '1'):\n\nFirst character (third '1'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (second '1'):\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nThird character (first '1'):\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all, f is false \u2192 append '3' \u2192 new_str is \"333\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"3333\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"3333\" \u2192 next i is 3333.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran are:\n\nAfter building new_str, reverse it to get the next_i's string, then convert to integer.\n\nSo the code for the transformation would be something like:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, new_str, reversed_str\n\ninteger :: current_i, next_i\n\nlogical :: f\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') current_i\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nnew_str = ''\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, n\n\n   current_char = s(n - j + 1: n - j + 1)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (current_char == '3') then\n\n         new_str = trim(new_str) // '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n         new_str = trim(new_str) // '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else\n\n         new_str = trim(new_str) // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      new_str = trim(new_str) // current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   new_str = trim(new_str) // '3'\n\nend if\n\nreversed_str = ''\n\ndo k = len_trim(new_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = trim(reversed_str) // new_str(k:k)\n\nend do\n\nread(reversed_str, *) next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you concatenate strings, you have to be careful with the lengths. Alternatively, using a character array for new_str and reversed_str.\n\nAlternatively, using the reverse function. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in reverse function, so we have to loop.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function reverse, but I think that's only in Fortran 2003 and may not be available in all compilers. So better to do it manually.\n\nSo the code above should work.\n\nNow, the loop in the second program's main function is:\n\ni starts at 357, and while i <= N (which is the first program's ans), do the following:\n\n- check if the current i contains '3', '5', and '7' in its digits.\n\n- if yes, increment c.\n\n- compute next_i via the transformation.\n\n- set i = next_i.\n\nWait, but in the code, the next_i is computed as per the transformation, and the loop continues until i exceeds N.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ninteger :: N, c, current_i, next_i\n\nc = 0\n\ncurrent_i = 357\n\ndo while (current_i <= N)\n\n   if (contains_3_5_7(current_i)) then\n\n      c = c + 1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! compute next_i via the transformation\n\n   ... (the code above)\n\n   current_i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nThe function contains_3_5_7 checks whether the number has all three digits.\n\nImplementing contains_3_5_7:\n\nWe can write a function that takes an integer and returns true if its string contains '3', '5', and '7'.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nlogical function has_all_digits(n)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   logical :: has3, has5, has7\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') n\n\n   has3 = .false.\n\n   has5 = .false.\n\n   has7 = .false.\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = s(i:i)\n\n      if (c == '3') has3 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '5') has5 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '7') has7 = .true.\n\n   end do\n\n   has_all_digits = has3 .and. has5 .and. has7\n\nend function\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the third program's code is straightforward: given an input n, output (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nWait, in Java's third program, the code is:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n\n    System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, given the input c (from the second step), compute:\n\nresult = (c / 3) * 2 + (mod(c,3) ==0 ? 0 : 1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so (c /3) is integer division.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, if c is 4:\n\n4/3 = 1, mod(4,3)=1 \u2192 so 1*2 +1 =3.\n\nWhich matches (4//3)*2 +1 (since 4//3 is 1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the third step is straightforward.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and array).\n\n2. Compute ans (first program's result).\n\n3. Use ans as N for the second step.\n\n4. Compute c via the second step's processing.\n\n5. Compute the third step's result based on c.\n\n6. Output the third step's result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the first part: reading the input.\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, arr(0:n-1) \u2192 but since n is not known at compile time, we need to read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays can be allocated dynamically. So:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(0:n-1))\n\nread(*,*) (arr(i), i=0, n-1)\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans = arr(0) +1\n\ndo i =1, n-1\n\n   ans = ans + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) +2\n\nend do\n\nThen, proceed to the second step.\n\nSecond step:\n\nN = ans\n\nc =0\n\ncurrent_i =357\n\ndo while (current_i <= N)\n\n   if (has_all_digits(current_i)) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! compute next_i via transformation\n\n   ... (code as above)\n\n   current_i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the transformation code needs to be inside the loop.\n\nSo the code for the transformation must be inside the loop.\n\nThis requires writing the code for the transformation inside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, write a function to compute next_i from current_i and N.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't have side effects, but we can write a function that returns next_i given current_i.\n\nSo perhaps better to write a function:\n\nfunction compute_next(current_i) result(next_i)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: current_i\n\n   integer :: next_i\n\n   ... (code to compute next_i from current_i)\n\nend function\n\nBut implementing that requires the code inside the function.\n\nAlternatively, inline the code.\n\nThis will be a bit lengthy, but manageable.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, ans, N, c, current_i, next_i\n\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n   !

So if mod(c,3) is 0, then add 0, else add 1.\n\nSo the expression is (c/3)*2 + (0 or 1).\n\nThe merge function can be used here: merge(1,0, mod(c,3)/=0).\n\nAlternatively, use an if statement.\n\nAlternatively, compute it as (c /3)*2 + (mod(c,3) /=0).\n\nWait, in Fortran, logical expressions can be used in arithmetic if they are converted to integers (true is -1, but that's not helpful). So better to use the merge function.\n\nAlternatively, compute:\n\nresult = (c /3)*2\n\nif (mod(c,3) /=0) result = result +1\n\nSo in code:\n\nresult = (c /3)*2\n\nif (mod(c,3) /=0) then\n\n   result = result +1\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, using the merge function:\n\nresult = (c/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(c,3)/=0)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The array in Fortran is 0-based, which matches the Java code.\n\n- The transformation code must correctly process the digits.\n\n- The has_all_digits function must correctly check for presence of 3,5,7.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nIn the transformation code, when building new_str, the initial new_str is an empty string. In Fortran, when you do new_str = trim(new_str) // '5', the trim is necessary because the initial new_str may have trailing spaces. But since it starts as an empty string, maybe trim is unnecessary. However, in Fortran, when you concatenate, the left-hand side is extended. So perhaps the trim is not needed, but better to include it to avoid any leading spaces.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nnew_str starts as an empty string. Then, each time, it's trimmed before appending. But since it's empty, trim(new_str) is still empty. So the first append is okay.\n\nBut when new_str is built, each step appends to the end. So the trim is redundant here, but harmless.\n\nAnother possible issue is the reversed_str. The loop to reverse the new_str:\n\nreversed_str starts as empty. Then, for each character from the end of new_str to the beginning, we append each character.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\ndo k = len_trim(new_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = trim(reversed_str) // new_str(k:k)\n\nend do\n\nYes, this loops from the last character to the first, appending each character, thus reversing the string.\n\nOnce reversed_str is built, we read it into next_i.\n\nNow, testing with the example where current_i is 357:\n\nThe code should compute next_i as 373, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: current_i = 3333 (from the example where 111 becomes 3333).\n\nThe next_i would be computed as follows:\n\ns is \"3333\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (each '3'):\n\nFirst character (last '3'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond '3' (second last):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nThird '3' \u2192 append '3'.\n\nFourth '3' \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo new_str is \"5333\".\n\nThen, reversed_str is \"3335\".\n\nSo next_i is 3335.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should handle this.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the new_str has leading zeros after reversing, but since we are parsing it as a number, leading zeros are okay (e.g., \"003\" becomes 3, but in the code, the next_i would be 3, but since current_i starts at 357 and N is the first program's ans, which is at least 1 (since arr[0]+1 is at least 1 if arr[0] is 0), but the code should handle it.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran program should work.\n\nNow, the final code:\n\nI'll write it step by step, making sure all parts are included.\n\nAlso, note that in the second step's loop, the code must compute next_i each time and update current_i.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, ans, N, c, current_i, next_i\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n   !
