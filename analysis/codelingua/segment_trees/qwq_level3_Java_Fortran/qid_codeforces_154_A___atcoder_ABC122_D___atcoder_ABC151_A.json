But if the line has more than two characters, it might be an issue. But according to the problem's first Java code, each of the K lines is a two-character string, so this should be okay.

But since N is the result of the first program, which is the sum of min(a,b) terms, which can't be negative. The minimum possible N is 0 (if all pairs contribute 0). But in that case, the second program's N=0, and the base case is current=0, and the initial state is 63. The result would be memo(0,63) = 1 (since current=0 is the starting point, and the base case for current=N=0 would be memo(0, state)=1 for all states, but when N=0, the base case is when current=0, so the initial call would be current=0, and the result is memo(0,63)=1. But in the code, when N=0, the loop for current starts at N-1 = -1, which is invalid. So need to handle that. Thus, adding a check:\n\nif (N ==0) then\n\n   count_result = memo(0,63)\n\nelse\n\n   do current = N-1 down to 0...\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, in the loop:\n\ndo current = min(N-1, 2000), 0, -1\n\nBut perhaps better to handle N=0 separately. Alternatively, in the code:\n\nif (N ==0) then\n\n   count_result = memo(0,63)\n\nelse\n\n   ! proceed with the loops\n\nend if\n\nBut in the code above, the base case is set for all states when current=N. So when N=0, the base case is current=0, and the loop for current from N-1 (which is -1) would not execute.",

Alternatively, since the maximum N is 2000 and the states are 64, the total number of states is 2001 * 64 = ~128,000, which is manageable.

So for current = N, all states except the final one (but actually, when current reaches N, the sequence is complete, so regardless of the last three characters, it's a valid sequence if it got there. Wait, no, the base case is when current == N, return 1. So for all states, when current == N, the count is 1. Wait, the base case is when current == N, return 1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (codeforces_154_A.java). It reads input from stdin: first a string, then an integer K, then K lines each with a two-character string. It processes these to compute a result 'res' by counting pairs of the two characters in the initial string, resetting when a different character is found. The final res is printed.\n\nFile 2 (atcoder_ABC122_D.java) is a dynamic programming problem. It reads an integer N, then uses memoization to count the number of valid DNA sequences of length N that don't contain \"AGC\" in certain ways. The result is printed modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFile 3 (atcoder_ABC151_A.java) is simple: it reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints it. Wait, but adding 1 to the first character? Like, if the input is \"a\", it would print \"b\"? But the code uses s.charAt(0)+1, which is correct.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But in the Fortran program, we need to chain them without I/O in between. So the entire sequence must be done in one program, with data passed between the steps.\n\nWait, but the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (the res value) is the input to the second program? Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is System.out.println(res). The second program's input is N, which is read via Scanner. So the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input to the second program's N? Then the second program's output is another number, which is the input to the third program's string? Wait, the third program expects a string as input. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check each program's input and output:\n\nFirst program (File1):\n\nInput: first line is a string (arr), then K, then K lines each with a two-character string. The output is an integer (res).\n\nSecond program (File2):\n\nInput is an integer N. Its output is a number (the count modulo 1e9+7).\n\nThird program (File3):\n\nInput is a string (the first line is read, then the first character is taken). Its output is a single character (the first character of the input string plus 1 in ASCII).\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nFile1's output (integer res) is the input to File2's N. Then File2's output (another integer) is the input to File3's string? Wait, but File3 expects a string. So that can't be right. Wait, maybe the outputs are being used as inputs in some way that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the outputs are being used as the next program's input. So the first program's output is an integer, which is the input to the second program (which expects N as an integer). Then the second program's output is an integer, which is the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. So that's a problem. Unless the third program is taking the integer as a string? Like, if the second program outputs \"123\", then the third program reads that as a string \"123\", then takes the first character (ASCII '1') and adds 1 to get '2', so output \"2\".\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the sequence is:\n\nFile1's output (integer res) is the input to File2's N. So the second program's input is that integer. Then the second program's output (another integer) is the input to the third program, which treats it as a string. So the third program's input is the string representation of that integer, and it takes the first character, adds 1, and outputs that.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (the initial string, K, and K lines of two-character strings).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (res).\n\n3. Use that res as the input N for the second program.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result (the count modulo 1e9+7).\n\n5. Use that result as the input string for the third program (so convert it to a string, then process the first character).\n\n6. Output the final result of the third program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must handle all steps in sequence, passing data between them without I/O in between.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nThe first program reads a string, then K, then K lines each with two characters. For each of the K lines, it processes the original string to count pairs of the two characters in the line, resetting when a different character is found.\n\nThe algorithm for each line is:\n\nInitialize a and b to 0. For each character in the original array:\n\n- if it's the first character of the current input line, a increments.\n\n- else if it's the second character, b increments.\n\n- else, add the minimum of a and b to res, then reset a and b to 0.\n\nAfter processing all characters, add the min(a,b) again.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the initial string, K, then K pairs. For each pair, process the original string as per the algorithm.\n\nSecond program's logic is a DP problem with memoization. The problem is to count the number of valid DNA sequences of length N, avoiding certain substrings. The memoization uses a map for each step and last 3 characters. The constraints are that the last 4 characters (including the new character) shouldn't form \"AGC\" in any way, even after swapping adjacent characters.\n\nThe third program is straightforward: take the first character of the input string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and print it.\n\nNow, translating all into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, reading the initial string. Since Fortran strings can be read with read(*,*) but need to handle variable length. Alternatively, using list-directed input. But for the first program's input, the first line is the string, then K, then K lines each with two characters.\n\nWait, in Java, the first line is read as a line (so including any whitespace?), but in the code, it's read as a line, then toCharArray. So in Fortran, perhaps read the first line as a string (with possible spaces?), but in the problem's context, probably the input is a single line without spaces. So in Fortran, read the first line as a string, then K as an integer, then K lines each with two characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading lines can be done with read(*, '(A)') for the first line. Then read K, then K times read two characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length unless using allocatable or assumed-length. So perhaps using a character array for the initial string.\n\nThen, for each of the K lines, read the two-character string. For each such pair, process the original string.\n\nThe processing for each pair:\n\nInitialize a and b to 0. Then loop over each character in the original string:\n\nif current char is the first of the pair, a +=1.\n\nelse if it's the second, b +=1.\n\nelse:\n\nres += min(a,b)\n\na and b reset to 0.\n\nAfter the loop, add min(a,b) again.\n\nSo in Fortran, need to loop over each character in the original string, track a and b, etc.\n\nSecond part: the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's input is N (the result from first program). The output is the count modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe DP approach uses memoization. The state is current length and the last three characters. The transitions are adding a new character (A, C, G, T) and checking if the new last four characters (previous three plus new) are valid.\n\nThe validity check is:\n\n- The new four-character string (last3 + new_char) must not contain \"AGC\".\n\n- Also, any swap of two adjacent characters in the four-character string must not create \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the Java code's isOK function checks:\n\nif the last4 contains \"AGC\", return false.\n\nThen, for each of the first three positions in the last4 string, swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, and check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps do, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, the code loops over i from 0 to 2 (since last4 is 4 characters?), but in the code, the last3 is the previous three, then adding a new character makes it four. Wait, the function isOK is called with last4 (the previous three plus the new character?), but in the code, the parameter is last4, which is the last four characters? Wait, in the code, the function isOK is called with last4, which is the last four characters? Let me check the code:\n\nIn the dfs function, when adding a new character c, the new last4 would be last3 + c. So the isOK function checks that this new four-character string is valid.\n\nThe isOK function first checks if the four-character string contains \"AGC\". If yes, invalid.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2 (since the string is 4 characters, indices 0-3), swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, and check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps do, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, the code loops over i from 0 to 3-1 (since 3 is the length of the previous part?), but the code says for (int i=0; i<3; ++i). So for each i from 0 to 2 (since 3 elements?), the code swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in the last4 string, then checks if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code's code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n\n    vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n\n    String s = new String(vals);\n\n    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n\n        return false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code is taking the last4 string, and for each i from 0 to 2 (since 3 iterations), it swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters. Then checks if the resulting string has \"AGC\".\n\nWait, but the way it's done is:\n\nvals[i] = last4's (i+1)th character.\n\nvals[i+1] = last4's ith character.\n\nSo swapping the two characters at positions i and i+1.\n\nThen, the new string s is checked for \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of those swaps result in a string containing \"AGC\", then the original string is invalid.\n\nSo the isOK function returns true only if the original four-character string doesn't contain \"AGC\", and none of the three possible adjacent swaps (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3) in the four-character string would create \"AGC\".\n\nHmm, that's a bit tricky. So the four-character string must not have \"AGC\" in any of those swapped versions.\n\nThe DP approach uses memoization. The memo is an array of maps, where for each current length and last three characters, we store the number of valid sequences up to that point.\n\nIn Fortran, implementing memoization with a hash map is challenging because Fortran doesn't have built-in hash tables. So perhaps we can represent the last three characters as a string (e.g., \"TTT\") and use a 4D array or some encoding.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible characters are only A, C, G, T, each can be represented as a number (0-3). The last three characters can be encoded as a 3-digit number in base 4, giving 4^3 = 64 possible states. The current length can be up to N (which can be up to 2000, perhaps? The problem's constraints for ABC122_D might have N up to 2000 or so, but the original code uses memo up to N+1).\n\nWait, the problem's constraints for ABC122_D: looking at the problem statement (since I don't have it here), but the code uses N up to whatever the input is, but the memo is size N+1. So in Fortran, perhaps we can precompute the maximum N possible. But since the first program's output (res) is the input to the second program's N, and the first program's res can be up to... Let's see, the first program's res is the sum over K lines of min(a,b) for each line. The maximum possible a and b would depend on the input string's length. But for the purposes of coding, perhaps we can assume N can be up to, say, 1e5? Or maybe the problem's constraints for ABC122_D have N up to 2000? Let me think.\n\nLooking at the problem ABC122_D (AtCoder problem), the constraints are N \u2264 2000. So the maximum N is 2000. So in Fortran, the memo can be an array of size (2001) x (4^3) (since the last three characters can be 4^3 = 64 possibilities). So the memo can be a 2D array: memo(current, state) where current is from 0 to N, and state is an integer from 0 to 63 (each representing the last three characters).\n\nSo first, encode the last three characters as a number. For example, each character can be mapped to 0 (A), 1 (C), 2 (G), 3 (T). Then the three characters can be represented as (c1 * 16) + (c2 *4) + c3. So each of the three characters contributes a digit in base 4.\n\nWait, for example, \"TTT\" would be 3,3,3 \u2192 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63. \"AAA\" would be 0*16 +0*4 +0 =0.\n\nSo the state can be represented as an integer from 0 to 63.\n\nThus, the memo can be a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64, storing the number of ways modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which corresponds to state 63 (since T is 3, so 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63).\n\nThe function dfs(current, last3) returns the number of ways to build a sequence of length current, ending with last3, and valid.\n\nThe base case is when current == N, return 1.\n\nFor each possible next character (A, C, G, T), we check if adding it to the last3 (making last4 = last3 + new_char) is valid via the isOK function.\n\nWait, but in the code, the isOK function takes the last4 (the previous three plus the new character). So in the Fortran code, when considering adding a new character c (as a character, e.g., 'A'), we need to form the last4 string (last3_str + c), then check if it's valid.\n\nBut in the encoded state, the last3 is stored as an integer. So to form the last4, we can get the last two characters of the current state and add the new character. Wait, perhaps it's easier to handle the last3 as a string, but in Fortran, strings are a bit more cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, when considering adding a new character, we can compute the new last3 as the substring of the previous last3 (positions 1-3) plus the new character. Wait, the new last3 is the last two characters of the previous last3 plus the new character. For example, if previous last3 is \"TTT\" and new character is 'A', the new last3 is \"TTA\".\n\nSo in the encoded state, the previous state is s_prev, which is the code for the previous last3. To compute the new state after adding c, we can take the last two characters of the previous last3 (i.e., the last two digits of the state's encoding) and append the new character's code. So the new state is ( ( (s_prev mod 16) ) *4 ) + c_code.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the previous state is s_prev, which is (c1 *16) + (c2 *4) + c3. The last two characters are c2 and c3. So the new state after adding c_new would be (c2 *4) + c3 *1 (no, wait, the new last three would be c2, c3, c_new. So the new state is (c2 *16) + (c3 *4) + c_new.\n\nWait, the previous state is (c1, c2, c3). The new last three is (c2, c3, new_char). So the new state is (c2 * 16) + (c3 *4) + new_char_code.\n\nTo compute this from the previous state s_prev:\n\nThe previous state s_prev can be broken down as:\n\nc1 = s_prev / 16 (integer division)\n\nremainder = s_prev mod 16 \u2192 (c2 *4 + c3)\n\nc2 = remainder /4\n\nc3 = remainder mod4\n\nSo the new state is (c2 *16) + (c3 *4) + new_char_code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the new state as ( (s_prev mod 16) *4 ) + new_char_code.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns_prev = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3 \u2192 mod 16 gives c2*4 + c3 \u2192 multiply by 4 \u2192 (c2*4 + c3)*4 = c2*16 + c3*4 \u2192 then add new_char_code \u2192 c2*16 + c3*4 + new_char \u2192 which is exactly the new state (c2, c3, new_char).\n\nYes, so the new state is ( (s_prev mod 16) *4 ) + new_char_code.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the isOK function needs to check the four-character string formed by the previous last3 (three characters) plus the new character. Wait, no, the previous last3 is three characters, so adding the new character makes four characters. The isOK function checks that four-character string for validity.\n\nWait, the four-character string is the previous last3 (three characters) plus the new character. So the four characters are c1, c2, c3, new_char.\n\nWait, the previous last3 is c1, c2, c3. Adding new_char gives the four-character string c1c2c3new_char. We need to check this four-character string for the conditions.\n\nSo to compute the four-character string, we can get the previous three characters (c1, c2, c3) from the previous state s_prev, then add the new character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the four-character string as a string, but in Fortran, handling that might be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, in the isOK function, given the four characters (c1, c2, c3, c4), check:\n\n1. Does the four-character string contain \"AGC\"? (i.e., any substring of three characters that is \"AGC\".)\n\nWait, the first check is if the four-character string contains \"AGC\". Since it's four characters, the possible substrings of three are positions 0-2, 1-3. So check if any of those substrings is \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code's first check is if the four-character string contains \"AGC\". So if any three consecutive characters in the four form \"AGC\".\n\nThen, the second part: for each of the first three positions (i from 0 to 2), swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in the four-character string, then checks if the new string has \"AGC\".\n\nSo for each i in 0,1,2:\n\n- create a new string where the i and i+1 characters are swapped.\n\n- check if this new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these swaps result in a string with \"AGC\", then the original is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is a bit involved. Let's think of how to code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, for the four characters (c1, c2, c3, c4):\n\nCheck if any of the three-character substrings (positions 0-2, 1-3) is \"AGC\".\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2:\n\n- create a new string where characters at positions i and i+1 are swapped.\n\n- check if this new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nIf any of these is true, return false.\n\nSo in code, for each of the four characters, perhaps stored as an array of 4 characters, we can perform these checks.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps represent the four characters as a string of length 4, then check for the presence of \"AGC\".\n\nBut in Fortran, string functions like index can be used. For example, if the four-character string contains \"AGC\", then index(s, 'AGC') will be non-zero.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the INDEX function returns the position where the substring starts. So if the substring is present, it returns a position between 1 and 4-3+1=2 (since 4-3+1=2). So for a four-character string, the substring \"AGC\" can start at position 1 or 2.\n\nSo first check:\n\nif (index(four_char, 'AGC') >0) then \u2192 invalid.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2 (assuming 0-based?), but in Fortran strings are 1-based.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So the four characters are positions 1-4.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to 3 (since swapping positions i and i+1):\n\ncreate a new string where characters at i and i+1 are swapped.\n\nCheck if this new string contains 'AGC'.\n\nSo for each i in 1 to 3:\n\ntemp = four_char\n\ntemp(i:i+1) = temp(i+1)//temp(i)\n\nif (index(temp, 'AGC') >0) then \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, the isOK function can be implemented in Fortran with these checks.\n\nNow, the DP part.\n\nThe memo array can be a 2D array of size (N_max+1) x 64, where N_max is the maximum possible N (from the first program's output). Since the first program's output can be up to, say, 1e5 (if K is large and the string has many pairs), but the second program's N is that value. However, the problem's constraints for ABC122_D have N up to 2000, so perhaps the first program's output can't exceed 2000? Or maybe it can, but the second program can handle it. Wait, the second program's code uses N as input, so if the first program's output is larger than 2000, then the second program would have to handle it. But the problem's original code for ABC122_D may have constraints that N is up to 2000. So perhaps the first program's output is within that range.\n\nAssuming that the second program's N can be up to 2000, then the memo array can be dimensioned as (2001, 64), since current can go up to N.\n\nThe DP function can be implemented with recursion, but Fortran doesn't have memoization in the same way as Java's HashMap. So we need to implement it iteratively or with a memo table filled in a bottom-up manner.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is similar to a DP with memoization, perhaps we can use a memo array and fill it in a bottom-up way.\n\nWait, the recursive approach with memoization can be implemented with a memo array. Since Fortran allows arrays, we can pre-initialize the memo array with -1 (or some sentinel value) to indicate uncomputed states.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nInitialize memo array to -1.\n\nDefine a function dfs(current, state) that returns the number of ways.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't be recursive with memoization unless we use a helper function and pass the memo array. Alternatively, we can implement it iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum N is 2000 and the states are 64, the total number of states is 2001 * 64 = ~128,000, which is manageable.\n\nSo the approach would be to precompute the memo array using dynamic programming.\n\nInitialize memo[N][state] = 1 if current == N? Wait, no. The base case is when current == N, the count is 1. So for current = N, all states except the final one (but actually, when current reaches N, the sequence is complete, so regardless of the last three characters, it's a valid sequence if it got there. Wait, no, the base case is when current == N, return 1. So for all states, when current == N, the count is 1.\n\nWait, the base case is when current == N, return 1. So for all states, when current is N, the value is 1.\n\nThen, for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\nfor each state in 0..63:\n\n   if memo[current][state] is not computed yet:\n\n      compute it by considering all possible next characters (A, C, G, T).\n\n      For each next_char in ['A','C','G','T']:\n\n          compute the four_char string (the previous three characters of state plus next_char).\n\n          check if this four_char is valid via isOK.\n\n          if valid:\n\n              new_state is computed as ( (state mod 16)*4 + next_char_code )\n\n              add the memo[current+1][new_state] to the current count.\n\n      memo[current][state] = sum of valid transitions mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the transitions are forward. Alternatively, the recursive approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the memo array as memo(current, state) = number of ways to reach current length with last three characters 'state'.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nmemo(current, state) = sum over all possible next_char (A,C,G,T) of:\n\n   if adding next_char to the last three (state) forms a valid four_char string,\n\n   then memo(current+1, new_state) is added.\n\nWait, but the direction is from current to current+1. So perhaps it's better to compute it bottom-up.\n\nStarting from current = N, where memo(N, any state) = 1.\n\nThen for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n   for each state in 0..63:\n\n      total = 0\n\n      for each possible next_char (A, C, G, T):\n\n          code = char_to_code(next_char)\n\n          four_char is formed by the previous three characters of 'state' plus next_char.\n\n          check if four_char is valid via isOK.\n\n          if yes:\n\n              new_state = ( (state mod 16)*4 + code )\n\n              total += memo(current+1, new_state)\n\n      memo(current, state) = total mod MOD\n\nWait, but the new_state is the new last three characters (the last two of the previous state plus the new character). So the new_state is computed as ( (state mod 16)*4 + code ), as before.\n\nThus, this bottom-up approach can be implemented in Fortran with loops.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the third program's part is simple: take the output of the second program (the count modulo 1e9+7), convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output it.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statement into a character variable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the first program's inputs: the initial string, K, and K pairs.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (res).\n\n3. Use res as N for the second program.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result (count modulo 1e9+7).\n\n5. Convert that count to a string, take the first character, add 1, and output.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nRead the initial string. Since Fortran strings can be read with read(*, '(A)') but need to know the length. Alternatively, read into a character array of sufficient size.\n\nSuppose the initial string is up to, say, 1e5 characters (but the problem's first program's input may have a string of any length, but in practice, perhaps manageable).\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of size, say, 1e5.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can read the entire line with:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nThen, the length is len_trim(s).\n\nThen read K as an integer.\n\nThen read K lines, each with two characters. So for each of K lines:\n\nread(*, '(A2)') pair\n\nBut in Fortran, reading two characters from each line. But if the line has more than two characters, it might be an issue. But according to the problem's first Java code, each of the K lines is a two-character string, so this should be okay.\n\nThen, process each pair:\n\nInitialize res =0.\n\nFor each pair in the K pairs:\n\n   c1 = first character of the pair.\n\n   c2 = second character of the pair.\n\n   a =0, b=0.\n\n   loop over each character in s:\n\n      if char == c1 \u2192 a +=1\n\n      else if char == c2 \u2192 b +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          res += min(a, b)\n\n          a =0; b=0\n\n   after loop, add min(a,b) to res.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ndo i = 1, K\n\n   read(*, '(A2)') pair\n\n   c1 = pair(1:1)\n\n   c2 = pair(2:2)\n\n   a =0\n\n   b =0\n\n   do j =1, len_trim(s)\n\n      ch = s(j:j)\n\n      if (ch == c1) then\n\n          a = a +1\n\n      else if (ch == c2) then\n\n          b = b +1\n\n      else\n\n          res = res + min(a, b)\n\n          a =0\n\n          b =0\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   res = res + min(a, b)\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nN = res\n\nNow, compute the second program's result.\n\nImplement the DP as described.\n\nFirst, define the MOD as 1000000007.\n\nWe need to encode the characters A, C, G, T as 0,1,2,3.\n\nWe can create a function to convert a character to its code:\n\ninteger function char_code(c)\n\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n\n   select case (c)\n\n   case ('A')\n\n      char_code =0\n\n   case ('C')\n\n      char_code =1\n\n   case ('G')\n\n      char_code =2\n\n   case ('T')\n\n      char_code =3\n\n   end select\n\nend function\n\nSimilarly, a function to get the four characters from a state and a new character.\n\nWait, perhaps better to precompute the four characters when needed.\n\nThe main steps for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array memo(current, state). Since current can be up to N (which can be up to 2000), and state up to 63, we can dimension it as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2000, 0:63) :: memo\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so perhaps better to use 0-based indices.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N, 0:63) :: memo\n\nBut since N is variable (from the first part's res), we need to allocate it dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum N is 2000 (assuming the problem constraints), we can pre-allocate up to 2000.\n\nWait, but the first program's res could be larger than 2000. Hmm, but the second program's problem (ABC122_D) likely has constraints that N is up to 2000. So perhaps the first program's output can't exceed that. Let me check the problem's constraints for ABC122_D.\n\nLooking up ABC122_D's problem statement (since I can't access it now), but the code's memo is up to N, and the problem's constraints probably have N up to 2000. So assuming that the first program's output is within that range.\n\nThus, we can pre-allocate the memo array as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2000, 0:63) :: memo\n\nInitialize all elements to -1 (uncomputed).\n\nThen, set the base case:\n\ndo state =0, 63\n\n   memo(N, state) =1\n\nend do\n\nThen, for current from N-1 down to 0:\n\n   do state =0, 63\n\n      if (memo(current, state) == -1) then\n\n          total =0\n\n          do c =0,3 !

To check, need to convert c1, c2, c3, c to characters.\n\n              ! create a string of four characters.\n\n              char1 = char(65 + c1) ! A is 65, so 0\u2192A, 1\u2192C (wait, no, need to map 0\u2192A, 1\u2192C, 2\u2192G, 3\u2192T.\n\n              Wait, the code for the characters:\n\n              The code 0 is 'A', 1 is 'C', 2 is 'G', 3 is 'T'.\n\n              So:\n\n              char1 = 'A' + c1 \u2192 but in Fortran, characters can't be added like that. Need to use a function.\n\n              Alternatively, create a character array for the four characters:\n\n              four_char(1) = char(65 + c1) \u2192 but wait:\n\n              0 \u2192 'A' (ASCII 65)\n\n              1 \u2192 'C' (ASCII 67)\n\n              2 \u2192 'G' (ASCII 71)\n\n              3 \u2192 'T' (ASCII 84)\n\n              So:\n\n              function code_to_char(code) result(c)\n\n                  integer, intent(in) :: code\n\n                  character(1) :: c\n\n                  select case (code)\n\n                  case (0)\n\n                      c = 'A'\n\n                  case (1)\n\n                      c = 'C'\n\n                  case (2)\n\n                      c = 'G'\n\n                  case (3)\n\n                      c = 'T'\n\n                  end select\n\n              end function\n\n              So using this function:\n\n              c1_char = code_to_char(c1)\n\n              c2_char = code_to_char(c2)\n\n              c3_char = code_to_char(c3)\n\n              new_char = code_to_char(c)\n\n              four_char = [c1_char, c2_char, c3_char, new_char]\n\n              Wait, but in Fortran, strings are easier. Let's make a 4-character string:\n\n              four_char = code_to_char(c1) // code_to_char(c2) // code_to_char(c3) // code_to_char(c)\n\n              Then, check if this four_char is valid via isOK.\n\n              The isOK function:\n\n              logical function isOK(four_char)\n\n                  character(len=4), intent(in) :: four_char\n\n                  !

Also, the loops are nested, but manageable.\n\nOnce the memo is filled, the result is memo(0, initial_state), where the initial_state is the code for \"TTT\".\n\nThe initial_state is computed as:\n\n\"TTT\" \u2192 each T is code 3.\n\nSo c1=3, c2=3, c3=3 \u2192 state = 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 =63.\n\nThus, the result is memo(0, 63).\n\nWait, but in the code's initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which corresponds to current=0 and state=63.\n\nThus, the final result is memo(0, 63).\n\nOnce we have that, we proceed to the third part.\n\nThird part:\n\nTake the result (count) from the second part, convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nresult_str = ''\n\nwrite(result_str, '(I0)') count\n\nfirst_char = result_str(1:1)\n\nnew_char = char(ichar(first_char) +1)\n\nprint *, new_char\n\nBut need to ensure that the count is written as a string. Also, if the count is zero, it would be written as '0', so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nFirst, read the first program's inputs.\n\nThen compute res.\n\nThen compute the second part's result.\n\nThen compute the third part's output.\n\nNow, handling the variables:\n\nVariables needed:\n\nFor first part:\n\n- s: the initial string (character array)\n\n- K: integer\n\n- pairs: array of K pairs (each two characters)\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps read each pair on the fly.\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\n- N = res\n\n- MOD = 1000000007\n\n- memo array (0:2000, 0:63)\n\n- functions to convert code to char and vice versa.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: res, N, K, i, j, a, b, current, state, c, total, MOD=1000000007\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: pair\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2000, 0:63) :: memo\n\ninteger :: count_result\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: result_str\n\ncharacter :: first_char, new_char\n\n!

But when forming the four_char string, the new character is c, so the code_to_char(c) is correct.\n\nSecond, in the calculation of new_state:\n\nnew_state = ( (state mod 16)*4 + c )\n\nYes, because the previous state's last two characters are c2 and c3 (from state mod 16 = c2*4 +c3), so multiplying by 4 gives c2*16 + c3*4, then adding c gives c2*16 +c3*4 +c \u2192 which is the new state's code.\n\nThird, the memo array is initialized to -1, but in Fortran, when you declare an array with default values, they are not initialized. So we need to set all elements to -1 first.\n\nWait, in the code above, after declaring the memo array, we have:\n\nmemo = -1\n\nBut in Fortran, this is allowed if the array is of integer type. So that's okay.\n\nAnother point: in the loop over current from N-1 down to 0, but if N is 0, then current starts at -1, which is invalid. But since N is the result of the first program, which is the sum of min(a,b) terms, which can't be negative. The minimum possible N is 0 (if all pairs contribute 0). But in that case, the second program's N=0, and the base case is current=0, and the initial state is 63. The result would be memo(0,63) = 1 (since current=0 is the starting point, and the base case for current=N=0 would be memo(0, state)=1 for all states, but when N=0, the base case is when current=0, so the initial call would be current=0, and the result is memo(0,63)=1.\n\nBut in the code, when N=0, the loop for current starts at N-1 = -1, which is invalid. So need to handle that.\n\nThus, adding a check:\n\nif (N ==0) then\n\n   count_result = memo(0,63)\n\nelse\n\n   do current = N-1 down to 0...\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, in the loop:\n\ndo current = min(N-1, 2000), 0, -1\n\nBut perhaps better to handle N=0 separately.\n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nif (N ==0) then\n\n   count_result = memo(0,63)\n\nelse\n\n   ! proceed with the loops\n\nend if\n\nBut in the code above, the base case is set for all states when current=N. So when N=0, the base case is current=0, and the loop for current from N-1 (which is -1) would not execute. Thus, the memo(0,63) is set to 1, so the result is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle N=0.\n\nAnother possible issue is the size of the memo array. If N exceeds 2000, the code will have an out-of-bounds error. But assuming the first program's output is within the problem's constraints for the second program, this should be okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\nInput string: \"AB\"\n\nK=1\n\nPair: \"AB\"\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor each character in \"AB\":\n\nFirst character 'A' is first of pair, so a=1, b=0.\n\nSecond character 'B' is neither of the pair's characters (pair is \"AB\", so first is 'A', second is 'B').\n\nWait, the pair is \"AB\", so the two characters are 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo processing the second character 'B':\n\nit is the second character of the pair, so b becomes 1.\n\nNo other characters, so after loop, add min(1,1)=1 to res. Total res is 1.\n\nThus, N=1.\n\nSecond program's input N=1.\n\nThe count is the number of valid sequences of length 1. Since any single character is valid (no four characters to check), so there are 4 possibilities (A, C, G, T). But the initial state is \"TTT\" (but for current=0, adding a character to make length 1.\n\nWait, the initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"), which is current=0, last3 is \"TTT\".\n\nWait, when N=1, the sequence must be of length 1. The last three characters can't exist, but the code uses the last three as \"TTT\" initially.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic for N=1 is handled correctly.\n\nThe DP for N=1:\n\ncurrent=0, state=63 (TTT).\n\nFor each possible next character (A, C, G, T):\n\nThe four_char is \"TTT\" + next_char \u2192 but wait, the previous three are TTT, adding next_char makes four characters: TTT followed by next_char.\n\nWait, no, the previous three are TTT, adding the new character makes four characters: T T T c.\n\nThe isOK function checks if this four-character string contains \"AGC\" or any swap creates it.\n\nSince the four characters are TTT followed by any character, it's unlikely to have \"AGC\".\n\nThus, all four options are valid, so the new_state after adding each character would be the last three characters: T T c.\n\nThus, for each next_char (0-3):\n\nnew_state = ( (63 mod 16)*4 + c )\n\n63 mod 16 is 63-3*16=15 \u2192 15 mod16 is 15 \u2192 15*4 +c \u2192 60 +c.\n\nThus, new_state for next_char 0 (A) is 60+0=60 \u2192 which is T T A (since 60 is 3*16 + 3*4 +0 \u2192 3,3,0 \u2192 T T A?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nstate =60 \u2192 60 divided by 16 is 3 (3*16=48, remainder 12).\n\nremainder 12 divided by4 is 3 \u2192 c2=3, c3=0 \u2192 so the three characters are c1=3 (T), c2=3 (T), c3=0 (A). So the last three are TTA.\n\nThus, the new_state after adding A is TTA.\n\nThe four_char is TTTA \u2192 which doesn't contain AGC, and swapping any two adjacent characters won't create AGC.\n\nThus, all four options are valid, so the total for current=0, state=63 is sum of memo(1, new_state) for each c.\n\nmemo(1, new_state) is 1 for all new_state, since current=1 (N=1) \u2192 all states have memo(1, state)=1.\n\nThus, total is 4 \u2192 mod 1e9+7 is 4.\n\nThus, the count_result is 4.\n\nThird part: converting 4 to string \"4\", first character is '4', adding 1 gives '5'.\n\nThus, the final output is '5'.\n\nBut let's see what the third program would do with input \"4\".\n\nThe third program reads the string \"4\", takes the first character '4', adds 1 \u2192 53 (ASCII for '5') \u2192 outputs '5'.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 0 (N=0).\n\nThen the second program's count is 1 (since current=0, and the initial state is TTT, but the base case is when current=N=0, so the count is 1).\n\nThird part: converting 1 to \"1\", first character '1' \u2192 '2'.\n\nThus, output '2'.\n\nAnother test case where the second program's output is 0 (but modulo 1e9+7, but it can't be zero unless there are no valid sequences).\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran needs to be written with all these functions and loops.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The memo array's size. If N exceeds 2000, it will crash. But assuming the first program's output is within the problem's constraints.\n\n- The isOK function's implementation.\n\n- The character encoding functions.\n\n- The loops' indices.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, the code reads K pairs. Each pair is read as a two-character string. But in Fortran, if the input line has more than two characters, it might read incorrectly. But according to the problem's first Java code, each of the K lines is exactly two characters, so this should be okay.\n\nNow, writing the full Fortran code with all the functions and loops."
