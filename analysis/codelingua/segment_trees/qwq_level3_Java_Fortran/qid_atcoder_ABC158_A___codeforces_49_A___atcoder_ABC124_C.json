For each i from 1 to length-1 (assuming 0-based), if a[i] == a[i-1], then flip the current character (i) to the opposite (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0), and increment a1. Wait, in the code: if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i - 1)) {\n    if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n    else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n    a1++;\n} Wait, so when the current character is same as previous, it flips the current character. So for example, if the string is \"001\", then at i=1 (the second '0'), it would flip to '1', making the string \"011\", but then at i=2, the third character is '1', same as previous (now '1'), so it would flip again.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string from input. It checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, it outputs \"Yes\"; else \"No\". But in the sequence, the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, but the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. So the third program's input comes from the second's output. But the third program's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but the problem says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's input is the user's input, then the second uses the first's output, third uses the second's output, and the third's output is the final output. So in the Fortran program, I need to process the input through all three steps without I/O in between.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input (from user) into a variable.\n2. Process through first Java program's logic (check for A and B).\n3. Take the result (Yes/No) and process through second Java's logic (find last non-space/non-? character and check if it's a vowel).\n4. Take that result (YES/NO) and process through third Java's logic (count minimal changes in a binary string? Wait, the third program's input is a string, but the second's output is a two-letter string (Yes or No). Wait, let me check the second program again.\n\nWait, the second Java program (codeforces_49_A) takes a string, then looks for the last non-space and non-? character. Then checks if it's a vowel (lowercase). Outputs YES or NO. So the output of the second program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string (probably the output from the second, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\"), but the third program's code is expecting a string of 0s and 1s? Wait, looking at the third Java code:\n\nThe third program's solve method takes a string x (from input), then processes it to count the minimal changes between two methods. The code is about a binary string (since it's dealing with '0's and '1's). Wait, but the input to the third program in the sequence would be the output of the second program, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\". But \"YES\" and \"NO\" are not binary strings. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then the second program's input is that string, and it processes it. Let me see the second program's code again.\n\nSecond program's code:\n\nIt reads a string s via nextLine(). Then loops from the end to find the first non-space and non-? character. Then checks if that character is a vowel. So if the input to the second program is \"Yes\", then the last character is 's', which is not a vowel, so output would be \"NO\". Wait, but \"Yes\" ends with 's', so the second program would output \"NO\". Hmm, but the second program's output is either YES or NO. Then the third program's input is that string (e.g., \"NO\"), but the third program expects a binary string. Wait, that can't be right. There's a problem here. Because the third program's code is expecting a string of 0s and 1s, but the input from the second program is a two-letter string (like \"YES\" or \"NO\"). That would cause an error in the third program's processing. But the original Java code must have been designed so that the sequence works. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is a string. Let me re-examine each step.\n\nFirst program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is that string. The second program processes it, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\". Then the third program's input is that output. But the third program's code is expecting a string of 0s and 1s. So how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the third Java program's code again. The third program's solve method takes a string x, which is read via in.next(). The code processes x as a binary string (since it's checking characters '0' and '1'). So the input to the third program must be a string of 0s and 1s. But the second program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters, not 0/1. That's a contradiction. So maybe the sequence is not as I thought. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the same as the first's input? No, the problem says the output of each is input to the next. So there's a problem here. Unless I made a mistake in the code analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nFirst Java program's solve method:\n\nThe first program's code is in the class AStationAndBus. The solve method reads a string s (using in.next()), then checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If so, outputs \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nSecond program's code: codeforces_49_A. It reads a string s via nextLine(). Then loops from the end to find the first non-space and non-? character. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase). Outputs YES or NO.\n\nThird program's code: atcoder_ABC124_C. The solve method reads a string x via in.next(). Then processes it as a binary string (0s and 1s). The code counts the minimal changes between two methods of flipping adjacent duplicates.\n\nSo the problem is that the second program's output is a string like \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is not a binary string. So the third program would process that string as x, but the code would treat each character as part of the binary string. For example, if the input to the third program is \"YES\", then x would be \"YES\", and the code would process each character as 'Y', 'E', 'S', which are not 0 or 1. So the code would have errors. But the original Java code must have been designed so that the sequence works. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the input for the third program.\n\nWait, maybe the third program's input is not the output of the second program. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So first's output is second's input, second's output is third's input. But the third program's code requires a binary string. So unless the second program's output is a binary string, which it isn't. So there's a problem here. Maybe I made a mistake in the code analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the third program's input is not the output of the second program. Let me check the third program's code again. The third program's solve method uses in.next() to read the input. The InputReader's next() method reads the next token, which is split by whitespace. So if the second program's output is \"YES\", then in.next() would read \"YES\" as the input string. But the code processes it as a binary string. So for example, if the input is \"YES\", then the code would process each character as part of the string. The code would check for consecutive duplicates. Let's see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe first loop processes the string a (initialized to x) by going forward. If two consecutive characters are the same, it flips the second to the opposite, and counts a1. The second loop processes the string b (initialized to x) by going backward, flipping the previous character if duplicates, counting a2. Then output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nBut if the input is \"YES\", then the characters are 'Y', 'E', 'S'. Since none are the same, a1 and a2 would be 0, so the output is 0. But that's possible. So the third program can process any string, even non-binary. Wait, but the code uses '0' and '1' in the processing. Let me see:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nif a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1), then flip to the opposite. So for example, if the characters are 'Y' and 'E', they are different, so no change. So the code would process any string, but the flipping is only done when the current and previous are the same. The code doesn't care if they are 0/1. Wait, but the code uses '1' and '0' in the flipping. For example, if the current character is 'Y', and the previous is also 'Y', then it would flip to '0'? That would be a problem. But in the input from the second program, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\", the characters are all different, so the code would not do any flipping, so the output would be 0. So maybe the third program can handle any string, but the problem expects that the input is a binary string. But in the sequence, the input to the third program is the output of the second, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the third program would process that and output 0. So the final output would be 0 in that case.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is possible. So the Fortran program must process the input through all three steps.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, without I/O in between. The first step reads the input, then processes through the three steps, and the last step outputs the final result.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (from stdin) into a string (call it s1).\n\n2. Process s1 through the first Java program's logic:\n\n   Check if s1 contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, result is \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n3. Take that result (s2) and process through the second Java's logic:\n\n   Find the last character in s2 that is not a space or '?'. Since s2 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", there are no spaces or '?', so the last character is the last letter. Convert to lowercase. Check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y). If yes, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n   For example, \"Yes\" ends with 's' (not a vowel), so output \"NO\". \"No\" ends with 'o' (vowel), so output \"YES\".\n\n4. Take that result (s3) and process through the third Java's logic:\n\n   The third step's input is s3 (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"). The third program's code processes this string as a binary string, but since the characters are letters, the code will process them as they are. The code counts the minimal changes between two methods. Since all characters are unique (e.g., \"YES\" has Y, E, S; \"NO\" has N, O), there are no consecutive duplicates, so a1 and a2 will both be 0. The output is 0.\n\nWait, but let's see for \"NO\":\n\nThe string is \"N\", \"O\". The first loop (forward):\n\nStart at i=1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? In Java, strings are 0-based. So in the third program's code, the loop starts at i=1 (since i < x.length(), and x.length() for \"NO\" is 2, so i goes from 1 to 1 (since 1 < 2). The first character is 'N', second is 'O'. They are different, so no change. a1 remains 0.\n\nThe second loop (backward):\n\nLoop from i = x.length()-1 (1) down to 1. So i starts at 1, then 0? Wait, the loop is for (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--). So for \"NO\", x.length() is 2, so i starts at 1, then 0? Wait, no, the loop is i starts at 1 (since 2-1=1), and i>0. So i=1, then i=0 is not >0. So the loop runs once. The code checks if b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1). For i=1, comparing 'O' and 'N' (since i-1 is 0). They are different, so no change. So a2 is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nSo the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is 0 when the second program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, let's see another example. Suppose the first program outputs \"Yes\" (so second program's input is \"Yes\"). The second program's output is \"NO\". Then third program's input is \"NO\", which gives 0. So the final output is 0.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs \"No\" (so second program's input is \"No\"). The second program's output is \"YES\" (since the last character is 'o', which is a vowel). Then third program's input is \"YES\", which has characters Y, E, S. All different, so output 0.\n\nSo the final output is always 0? Wait, but what if the second program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the third program's input is a string with consecutive duplicates?\n\nWait, the second program's output can only be \"YES\" or \"NO\". Let's see:\n\nIf the first program's output is \"Yes\", then second's output is \"NO\".\n\nIf first's output is \"No\", then second's output is \"YES\".\n\nOther possibilities? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"Yes\" (so s2 is \"Yes\"). The second program's processing:\n\nThe string is \"Yes\". The last non-space/non-? character is 's'. Lowercase 's' is not a vowel (since vowels are a,e,i,o,u,y). So output is \"NO\".\n\nIf first's output is \"No\", then the last character is 'o', which is a vowel. So output is \"YES\".\n\nOther cases: if first's output is \"Nope\", but that's not possible because first program's output is only \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether the input string contains both A and B. So the second program's input is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the second program's output is either \"NO\" (if first's output was \"Yes\") or \"YES\" (if first's output was \"No\").\n\nThus, the third program's input is either \"NO\" or \"YES\".\n\nIn both cases, the third program's processing will result in 0, as explained before.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 0? Wait, but let me check for \"YES\" as input to third program:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe string is \"YES\" (length 3). The first loop starts at i=1 (assuming 0-based). The first character is 'Y', second is 'E' (different), so no change. i=2: compare 'E' and 'Y'? No, wait, in the first loop, for i from 1 to length-1 (since in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i < x.length(); i++). So for \"YES\", length is 3, so i runs 1 and 2.\n\nAt i=1: compare index 1 (E) and 0 (Y). Different, so no change.\n\nAt i=2: compare index 2 (S) and 1 (E). Different, so no change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nThe second loop processes from the end. The loop is for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--). So for \"YES\", i starts at 2, then 1.\n\nAt i=2: compare index 2 (S) and 1 (E). Different, so no change.\n\nAt i=1: compare index 1 (E) and 0 (Y). Different, so no change. So a2 is 0. So min is 0.\n\nSame for \"NO\": the output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 0, regardless of the first two steps. Wait, that's interesting. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, unless there's a case where the third program's input has consecutive duplicates?\n\nWait, but the second program's output can only be \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have no duplicates. So the third program's output is always 0. So the final output is 0.\n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the third program's code is designed for a binary string. But in the sequence, the input to the third program is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are not binary. But the code still processes them as per their characters. Since there are no consecutive duplicates, the count is zero. So the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is 0, but only if the second program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is \"No\", then second's output is \"YES\", which is 4 letters. Let's see \"YES\" has length 3. Wait, \"YES\" is 3 letters, so the third program's processing is as before.\n\nSo the final output is always 0. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the input to the first program. Wait, that can't be right. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's input is \"AB\", so it outputs \"Yes\". Then second program's input is \"Yes\", which ends with 's', so output is \"NO\". Third program's input is \"NO\", which gives 0. So final output is 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's input is \"A\", so it doesn't have B, so output is \"No\". Second program's input is \"No\", which ends with 'o', so output is \"YES\". Third program's input is \"YES\", which gives 0. So again 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's input is \"B\", output \"No\". Second gives \"YES\", third gives 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's input has neither A nor B, so output \"No\". Second gives \"YES\", third gives 0.\n\nWait, so in all cases, the final output is 0. That's strange. So the entire sequence's final output is always 0? That's possible, but maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's processing. Let me re-examine the third program's code.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe first loop processes the string a (initialized to x) by going forward. For each i from 1 to length-1 (assuming 0-based), if a[i] == a[i-1], then flip the current character (i) to the opposite (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0), and increment a1.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i - 1)) {\n    if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n    else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n    a1++;\n}\n\nWait, so when the current character is same as previous, it flips the current character. So for example, if the string is \"001\", then at i=1 (the second '0'), it would flip to '1', making the string \"011\", but then at i=2, the third character is '1', same as previous (now '1'), so it would flip again. Wait, but the loop is going forward, so each step is processed once. Let me see:\n\nTake \"001\":\n\nInitially a is \"001\".\n\ni=1 (second character):\n\na[0] is '0', a[1] is '0' \u2192 same. So flip a[1] to '1', a becomes \"011\". a1 becomes 1.\n\ni=2 (third character):\n\na[1] is '1', a[2] is '1' \u2192 same. So flip a[2] to '0', a becomes \"010\". a1 becomes 2.\n\nSo a1 is 2.\n\nBut the second loop processes backward. Let's see for \"001\":\n\nThe second loop starts from the end (i=2 down to 1):\n\ni=2: compare a[2] and a[1]. Initially, the original string is \"001\".\n\nWait, the second loop uses a different string b, which is initialized to x (original input). So for the second loop, the initial b is \"001\".\n\nProcessing the second loop (for a2):\n\nLoop from i = 2 down to 1:\n\ni=2: compare b[2] (1) and b[1] (0). Not same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1: compare b[1] (0) and b[0] (0). Same \u2192 so flip b[0] (since the code checks if the current and previous are same, then flips the previous? Wait, the code says:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') \u2192 set to '0'\n\n    else \u2192 set to '1'\n\n    a2++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is flipping the previous character (i-1) instead of the current. Because the code is:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') \u2192 set b[i-1] to '0'\n\n    else \u2192 set to '1'\n\n    a2++;\n\n}\n\nSo for i=1 (since the loop is i starts at 2, then 1):\n\nWait, let's take the example of \"001\" again for the second loop:\n\nInitial b is \"001\".\n\nProcessing i=2 (third character):\n\nCheck b[2] (1) vs b[1] (0). Not same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1 (second character):\n\nCheck b[1] (0) vs b[0] (0). Same \u2192 so flip b[0] (since it's the previous character). So b[0] becomes '1', so the string becomes \"101\". a2 increments by 1.\n\nSo after processing, a2 is 1.\n\nThus, the minimal between a1 (2) and a2 (1) is 1.\n\nSo the third program's output depends on the input string's structure.\n\nBut in our case, the input to the third program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nLet me take \"YES\" as input to the third program:\n\nOriginal string is \"YES\".\n\nProcessing first loop (a):\n\nStart with a = \"YES\".\n\nLoop i from 1 to 2 (since length is 3).\n\ni=1: compare a[1] (E) and a[0] (Y). Different \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: compare a[2] (S) and a[1] (E). Different \u2192 no change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nSecond loop (b):\n\nStart with b = \"YES\".\n\nLoop i from 2 down to 1.\n\ni=2: compare b[2] (S) and b[1] (E). Different \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1: compare b[1] (E) and b[0] (Y). Different \u2192 no change. So a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, min(0,0) \u2192 0.\n\nSame for \"NO\":\n\nFirst loop:\n\ni=1 (O vs N \u2192 different \u2192 no change. a1=0.\n\nSecond loop:\n\ni=1 (O vs N \u2192 different \u2192 no change. a2=0.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 0, regardless of the first two steps. So the entire sequence's final output is 0.\n\nWait, but that's strange. So the entire sequence's output is always 0? That's possible, but perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's processing.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the second program's code again.\n\nSecond program's code:\n\nThe input is a string s (from first program's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nThe code loops from the end of the string to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Since \"Yes\" and \"No\" have no spaces or '?', the first non-space/non-? is the last character.\n\nThen, the code converts that character to lowercase. For \"Yes\", the last character is 's' \u2192 lowercase 's'. For \"No\", it's 'o' \u2192 lowercase 'o'.\n\nThen check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y). So 's' is not a vowel \u2192 output \"NO\". 'o' is a vowel \u2192 output \"YES\".\n\nThus, the second program's output is \"NO\" when first's output is \"Yes\", and \"YES\" when first's output is \"No\".\n\nThus, the third program's input is either \"NO\" or \"YES\".\n\nIn both cases, the third program's output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 0. So the entire sequence's final output is 0, regardless of the input to the first program.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting result. So the Fortran program can be written to always output 0, but that's only if the logic is correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third program's input is not the second's output. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input. So the third's input is the second's output, which is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThus, the third program's processing of those strings gives 0. So the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, process through all three steps, and output 0. But I need to make sure that the steps are correctly implemented.\n\nNow, to write the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin) into a variable, say s1.\n\n2. Process s1 to check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, set s2 to \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n3. Process s2 to find the last non-space/non-? character (which is the last character of s2). Convert to lowercase. Check if it is a vowel. If yes, set s3 to \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n4. Process s3 (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") through the third step's logic, which will return 0.\n\n5. Output 0.\n\nWait, but the third step's processing must be done correctly. Let me code that part.\n\nThe third step's processing:\n\nThe third step's input is s3 (a string of \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nThe code for the third step is to process the string as follows:\n\nInitialize a and b as copies of s3.\n\nFor a:\n\nLoop from i=2 to len(s3) (assuming Fortran uses 1-based indices). Wait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first loop starts at i=1 (0-based in Java). So in Fortran, for a string of length n, the indices are 1 to n.\n\nSo for the first loop (forward):\n\nDo i = 2, len_trim(s3)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       flip the current character (i) to the opposite (0 <->1, but since the characters are letters, this is irrelevant here, but the code would still process as per the characters).\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, the flipping is based on '0' and '1'. But in our case, the input is letters, so the code would flip between the current character and its opposite (but since they are letters, it's not 0/1, so the code would flip to '0' or '1'? Wait, no, the code in Java does:\n\nif the current character is '1', set to '0', else set to '1'.\n\nWait, in the first loop's code:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == '1') \u2192 set to '0'\n\nelse \u2192 set to '1'\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == '1') \u2192 set to '0'\n\nelse \u2192 set to '1'\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else set to '1'.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n\nelse a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n\nWait, so regardless of the previous character, if the current is '1', it becomes '0', else '1'. But this is only done when the current and previous are the same.\n\nWait, the condition is that the current and previous are the same. So when they are same, the current is flipped to the opposite (so that they are different now).\n\nWait, for example, if previous and current are both '0', then current becomes '1', so they are different now.\n\nThus, the code is trying to make sure that consecutive duplicates are removed by flipping the current character.\n\nBut in our case, the input is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which have no duplicates. So the code does nothing, and a1 and a2 remain 0.\n\nThus, the third step's processing can be skipped, and the result is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIf yes, then the second step's output is \"NO\", else \"YES\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, first step's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond step's output is \"NO\" if first's output was \"Yes\", else \"YES\".\n\nThird step's output is 0.\n\nThus, the final output is 0 regardless.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, do nothing with it, and output 0. But that's only if the logic is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the second step's processing. Let me recheck.\n\nSecond step's processing:\n\nInput is s2 (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nThe code finds the last character (since no spaces or ?).\n\nConvert to lowercase: 's' or 'o'.\n\nCheck if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\nFor 's' \u2192 no \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nFor 'o' \u2192 yes \u2192 output \"YES\".\n\nThus, the second step's output is \"NO\" when first's output is \"Yes\", and \"YES\" when first's output is \"No\".\n\nThus, the third step's input is either \"NO\" or \"YES\".\n\nThird step's processing of those strings gives 0.\n\nThus, the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is always 0, regardless of the input.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to simply output 0 after reading the input. But that's only if the logic is correct. But perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, what if the first program's output is \"No\", then second's output is \"YES\", which is 4 letters? Wait, \"YES\" is 3 letters. \"NO\" is 2 letters.\n\nWait, the third program's processing of \"YES\" (3 letters):\n\nThe first loop (forward):\n\ni from 2 to 3 (since length is 3).\n\ni=2: compare character 2 (E) with 1 (Y). Different \u2192 no change.\n\ni=3: compare S and E \u2192 different \u2192 no change. So a1 is 0.\n\nSecond loop (backward):\n\ni from 3 down to 2.\n\ni=3: compare S and E \u2192 different \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: compare E and Y \u2192 different \u2192 no change. So a2 is 0.\n\nThus, min(0,0) \u2192 0.\n\nThus, the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, process through all steps, but the final output is always 0. So the code can be written as:\n\nRead the input string, then output 0.\n\nBut to be precise, I should implement all steps correctly, even if the result is always 0. Because the problem requires that the Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain.\n\nSo let's proceed to code it step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string. Let's use a character variable, say s1.\n\nThen, check if s1 contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nTo check for presence of 'A' and 'B', we can loop through each character.\n\nThen, set s2 to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThen, process s2 to get s3.\n\nThen, process s3 through the third step's logic, which will return 0.\n\nFinally, output 0.\n\nBut let's code each step properly.\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead s1 from stdin. In Fortran, we can read a line with read(*, '(A)') s1.\n\nBut need to handle possible trailing spaces. Alternatively, use a string of sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's use a character variable with a large enough length.\n\nSecond step:\n\nCheck if s1 contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWe can do this by checking if any character is 'A' and any is 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n\n   if (s1(i:i) == 'A') hasA = .true.\n\n   if (s1(i:i) == 'B') hasB = .true.\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   s2 = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   s2 = 'No'\n\nend if\n\nThird step:\n\nProcess s2 to get s3.\n\ns2 is either 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nWe need to find the last character (since no spaces or ?).\n\nTake the last character of s2.\n\nConvert to lowercase.\n\nCheck if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nlast_char = s2(len_trim(s2):len_trim(s2))\n\nlower_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)  ! assuming uppercase, but 'Yes' has lowercase 's'? Wait, in the first program's output, the output is \"Yes\" (with lowercase 's') or \"No\" (lowercase 'o')?\n\nWait, the first program's code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". The 'Yes' has uppercase Y and lowercase 'es', but in Java, the output is exactly \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, in the first Java program's code, the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the s2 string is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThus, the last character of \"Yes\" is 's', lowercase. The last character of \"No\" is 'o', lowercase.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe first program's code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn Java, the code uses out.println(\"Yes\") or \"No\". So \"Yes\" has uppercase Y and lowercase 'es', and \"No\" has uppercase N and lowercase 'o'.\n\nThus, the last character of \"Yes\" is 's', lowercase. The last character of \"No\" is 'o', lowercase.\n\nThus, in the second step's processing, the last character is already lowercase. So no need to convert.\n\nWait, the second program's code converts the character to lowercase. But in the input s2, the last character is already lowercase. So the conversion is redundant, but it's part of the logic.\n\nWait, the second program's code:\n\nch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n\nSo even if the character is lowercase, it's converted to lowercase again. So it's okay.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nlast_char = s2(len_trim(s2):len_trim(s2))\n\nlower_char = last_char  ! since it's already lowercase, but to be precise, we can use ichar and convert.\n\nBut perhaps better to code it properly.\n\nAlternatively, since the input s2 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", the last character is 's' or 'o', which are lowercase. So the code can proceed.\n\nCheck if lower_char is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nIf yes \u2192 s3 = 'YES'\n\nElse \u2192 s3 = 'NO'\n\nWait, the second program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\" (uppercase). Because in Java, the code uses System.out.println(\"YES\") or \"NO\".\n\nThus, in Fortran, s3 will be \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nFourth step: process s3 through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's logic is to process the string s3 (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and compute the minimal between a1 and a2.\n\nAs discussed, this will be 0.\n\nThus, the final output is 0.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input string s1.\n\nProcess to get s2 (Yes/No).\n\nProcess to get s3 (YES/NO).\n\nThen compute the third step's result (0).\n\nOutput 0.\n\nBut to be precise, let's code the third step's processing.\n\nThe third step's processing:\n\nThe input is s3 (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nWe need to compute a1 and a2.\n\nLet's code this part.\n\nFirst, create a copy of s3 for a and b.\n\na = s3\n\nb = s3\n\nCompute a1:\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(a)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the characters are letters, so this code would replace them with '0' or '1', but since the original characters are not '0' or '1', this would change them. However, since the characters are not the same as previous, the condition is never true, so a1 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly for a2:\n\na2 = 0\n\ndo i = len_trim(b), 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nAgain, since no consecutive duplicates, a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, the minimal is 0.\n\nTherefore, the code for the third step can be written, but it will always return 0.\n\nThus, the entire program can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=100) :: s1, s2, s3\n\n   logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n   integer :: a1, a2, min_val\n\n   !

Second step: process s2 to get s3\n\n   ! Find last character (no spaces or ?)\n\n   last_char = s2(len_trim(s2):len_trim(s2))\n\n   ! Convert to lowercase (already lowercase, but code does it)\n\n   lower_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)  ! in case it's uppercase, but in our case it's already lowercase\n\n   !

Output the result\n\n   print *, min_val\n\nend program main\n\nBut since the third step's processing will always result in 0, the code can be simplified to just output 0. However, to adhere to the problem's requirement of reproducing the exact behavior, including the intermediate steps, even if they don't affect the final result, we must include all steps.\n\nHowever, in the code above, even though the third step's processing is done, it will always compute 0, so the final output is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran program is as written above.\n\nBut let me check for possible errors.\n\nIn the second step's processing:\n\nThe variable 'last_char' is not declared. Need to declare it as a character.\n\nAlso, 'lower_char' is not declared.\n\nSo adding declarations:\n\ncharacter :: last_char, lower_char\n\nAlso, in the third step, variables a and b are not declared. They should be character variables.\n\nThus, adding:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: a, b\n\nAlso, the loops in the third step:\n\nIn the first loop (a1):\n\nThe loop is from 2 to len_trim(a). Since in Fortran, the loop is inclusive, so that's okay.\n\nIn the second loop (a2):\n\nThe loop is from len_trim(b) down to 2, step -1.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=100) :: s1, s2, s3, a, b\n\n   character :: last_char, lower_char\n\n   logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n   integer :: a1, a2, min_val, i\n\n   !
