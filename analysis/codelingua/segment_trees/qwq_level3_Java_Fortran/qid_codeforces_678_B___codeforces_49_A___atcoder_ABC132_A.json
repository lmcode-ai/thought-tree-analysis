    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_678_B) takes an integer input y, checks for leap years, and finds the next year where some condition based on the sum of days modulo 7 is met. The output is that next year. \n\nThe second file (codeforces_49_A) reads a string, checks the last non-space and non-question mark character, and determines if it's a vowel (case-insensitive). Outputs YES or NO.\n\nThe third file (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string, checks if exactly two distinct characters each appear exactly twice. Outputs Yes or No.\n\nThe key is to chain their outputs. The first's output is the input to the second, whose output is input to the third. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in the middle. So the entire process must be done in memory.\n\nFirst, I need to process the first program's logic. Let's see:\n\nFirst Java program steps:\n1. Read y from input.\n2. Check if y is a leap year (using check_leap).\n3. Then loop starting from y+1, for each i:\n   a. Check if i is leap, add 366 or 365 to sum.\n   b. When sum mod 7 is 0, check if the leap status of i matches the original y's leap status. If so, print i and exit.\n\nWait, the condition is: if (sum %7 ==0) then check if ( (i is leap and y was leap) OR (i is not leap and y wasn't leap) ). If so, output i.\n\nHmm, so the sum is accumulating days from y+1 onwards until the condition is met. The loop continues until that condition is met.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to compute this next year, then pass that as input to the second program's logic.\n\nSecond program's input is the output of first, which is a number (the year). But the second program expects a string. Wait, the first program's output is a year (integer), but the second program reads a line (string). So the first's output is the year as a string, which the second program processes as a string. Wait, but the second program is looking for the last non-space and non-? character. Wait, the first program's output is a number, so when it's printed, it's a string like \"2024\\n\". So the second program would read that as a string, then check the last character (assuming no spaces or ?). So the second program's input is the year as a string, so the last character is the last digit of the year. Wait, but the second program's logic is to check if the last non-space and non-? character is a vowel. Since the first program's output is a number, which doesn't have any spaces or ?, so the last character is the last digit. Wait, but digits aren't vowels. So the second program would output NO unless the last digit is a vowel? Wait, but digits aren't vowels. Wait, the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a number. So for example, if the first outputs 2024, then the second's input is \"2024\", so the last character is '4', which is not a vowel. So the second program would output NO. But maybe the first program's output is a string like \"2024\" (without any other characters), so the second program's processing would check the last character, which is a digit, so the answer is NO. Hmm, but maybe the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. So the second program's processing is to check the last character of that string. So the second program's output is either YES or NO based on that.\n\nThen the third program takes the second's output (YES or NO) as input. The third program expects a string, which is the input. Let's see: the third program checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Let's see:\n\nIf the second program outputs \"YES\", then the input to the third is \"YES\". The characters are Y, E, S. So three distinct characters, so the third would output No.\n\nIf the second outputs \"NO\", then the input is \"NO\" which has two characters, each once. So the third would output No as well. Wait, but the third program requires exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. So \"NO\" has two characters, each once, so it's not valid. Hmm, so maybe the third program's output would be No in either case. But perhaps I need to see the exact logic.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nIt reads a string s (using in.next(), which in Java reads until whitespace, but since the input is the output of the second program, which is a single line, it's okay). Then converts to a char array. Then counts the occurrences of each character. Then checks if all counts are 2 and there are exactly two entries in the map. So for \"YES\", the counts are Y:1, E:1, S:1 \u2192 so the map has three entries, each count 1. So the third would output No. For \"NO\", counts are N:1, O:1 \u2192 two entries, each count 1 \u2192 so again, not 2. So the third would output No. So in all cases, the third would output No? Unless the second's output is something else. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is a different number. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 2020 (a leap year). Then the second program's input is \"2020\", so the last character is '0', which is not a vowel \u2192 output NO. Then third's input is \"NO\" \u2192 two characters, each once \u2192 output No.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs 2021. The second's input is \"2021\", last character '1' \u2192 output NO \u2192 third's input is \"NO\" \u2192 same as before.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output could be a year like 2022, but the second program's input is \"2022\", last character '2' \u2192 no. So the second program's output is always NO? Unless the first program's output is a year ending with a vowel character. But digits can't be vowels. So the second program's output is always NO. Then the third program's input is \"NO\", which has two characters each once \u2192 so third outputs No.\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the second program's code.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nIt reads a line (nextLine()), then loops from the end backwards until it finds a character that is not ' ' or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase). So if the input is \"a?b\", then the last non-space and non-? is 'b', so check if 'b' is a vowel \u2192 no \u2192 output NO.\n\nSo the second program's output is YES only if the last non-space and non-? character is a vowel (lowercase). Since the first program's output is a number, which has no spaces or ?, the last character is the last digit. Since digits are not vowels, the second program will always output NO. Therefore, the third program's input is \"NO\".\n\nSo the third program's input is \"NO\", which has two characters, each appearing once. So the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a different string? Let me think again. The first program's output is the next year, which is an integer. So when printed, it's a string like \"2024\\n\". The second program reads the entire line (nextLine()), so the input is \"2024\" (without the newline?), or including? Well, in Java, nextLine() reads until the newline, so the input would be \"2024\" (the newline is part of the input but not included in the string). So the last character is '4', which is not a vowel. So the second program's output is NO. So the third program's input is \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the third program's input is \"NO\", which has two characters, each appearing once. So the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nHmm, so the entire chain would output \"No\" regardless of the input? But maybe I'm missing some edge case. Let me think of a scenario where the second program's output is a vowel.\n\nSuppose the first program outputs a year like 2025. The last character is '5', not a vowel. So no. What if the first program outputs a year like 2020 \u2192 '0', no. 2022 \u2192 '2', no. 2023 \u2192 '3', no. 2024 \u2192 '4', no. 2026 \u2192 '6', no. 2027 \u2192 '7', no. 2028 \u2192 '8', no. 2029 \u2192 '9', no. 2030 \u2192 '0', no. 2031 \u2192 '1', no. So no way for the second program to output YES. So the third program's input is always \"NO\", leading to \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a year like 2020, but the second program's input is \"2020\" \u2192 last character '0', so output NO. So the third program's input is \"NO\", which has two characters, each once \u2192 so third outputs No.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the entire chain is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first program's logic. Let me re-examine the first Java program.\n\nThe first program's loop starts at y+1, and for each i, adds 366 or 365 to sum. Then when sum mod 7 is 0, it checks if the leap status of i matches the original y's leap status. If so, output i and exit.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (sum %7 ==0) then:\n\nif ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ) \u2192 which is equivalent to (check_leap(i) == leap). So the leap status of i must be the same as the original y's leap status.\n\nSo the first program is looking for the next year i where the accumulated days from y+1 to i (inclusive?) such that the total days mod 7 is zero, and the leap status of i matches that of y.\n\nWait, the sum is initialized to 0, and for each i starting at y+1, we add 366 or 365. So the sum is the total days from y+1 up to i. Wait, no, because the loop is for (int i = y+1; ; i++), so for each i, we add the days of that year. So the sum is the total days from y+1 to i (inclusive). Wait, no, because for each i, we add the days of that year. So the first iteration is i = y+1, adding its days. Then next i is y+2, adding its days, etc. So the sum is the total days from y+1 up to and including i. So when the sum mod7 is zero, then check the leap condition.\n\nHmm, but the problem is to find the first such i where this happens.\n\nOnce found, the program outputs i.\n\nSo the first program's output is the next year i where the accumulated days from y+1 to i (inclusive) mod7 is zero, and the leap status of i matches that of y.\n\nNow, the second program's input is that i as a string. Since it's a number, the last character is a digit, so the second program's output is NO. So the third program's input is \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nSo the entire chain's output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where the first program's output is a year like 2020, but the second program's input is \"2020\", so the last character is '0', which is not a vowel. So the second outputs NO, third outputs No.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I need to code this correctly in Fortran, even if the output is always \"No\".\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program that does the same steps without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the y value) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the next year i).\n\n3. Take that i as a string, process it through the second program's logic (check last character is vowel \u2192 but since it's a digit, it's NO).\n\n4. Take the second's output (\"NO\") and process through the third program's logic (check if the string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice \u2192 \"NO\" has two characters, each once \u2192 output \"No\").\n\nSo the final output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code requires that the input is a string, which is the output of the second program. So in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read the initial input (y).\n\n- Compute the first program's result (i).\n\n- Convert i to a string (like \"2024\").\n\n- Process that string through the second program's logic (check last character is vowel \u2192 returns \"NO\").\n\n- Then take that \"NO\" string and process through the third program's logic (count characters, etc \u2192 returns \"No\").\n\nSo the Fortran program must do all these steps in memory.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program):\n\nWe need to compute the next year i where:\n\nsum of days from y+1 to i (inclusive) mod7 is 0, and leap(i) == leap(y).\n\nFirst, the leap function in Java is:\n\ncheck_leap(y) \u2192 returns true if divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not 100.\n\nIn Fortran, a function to check leap year:\n\nFUNCTION is_leap(y) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: y\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  res = MOD(y,400) == 0 .OR. (MOD(y,4) ==0 .AND. MOD(y,100)/=0)\nEND FUNCTION\n\nThen, the main loop:\n\nInitialize sum =0, and start at i = y+1.\n\nLoop:\n\nDO\n   i = current year (starting at y+1, increment each time)\n   if is_leap(i) then add 366 to sum else add 365\n   check if sum mod7 ==0\n   if yes, then check if is_leap(i) == is_leap(y)\n   if yes, then break and return i\n   else continue\nEND DO\n\nWait, but the loop is infinite until the condition is met. So in Fortran, need to loop until the condition is met.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead y from input.\n\nCompute leap_y = is_leap(y)\n\nsum =0\n\ni = y+1\n\nDO\n\n   if is_leap(i) then\n      sum = sum + 366\n   else\n      sum = sum + 365\n   end if\n\n   if MOD(sum,7) ==0 then\n      if (is_leap(i) .EQV. leap_y) then\n         exit\n      end if\n   end if\n\n   i = i +1\n\nEND DO\n\nOnce exited, the value of i is the result of the first program.\n\nThen, the second program's processing:\n\nTake the i (integer) and convert to a string. Let's say s = STR(i). But in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write/read.\n\nWe can write the integer to a character variable.\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=10) :: s\nWRITE(s, '(I0)') i\ns = ADJUSTL(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process s through the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\nFind the last character in s that is not a space or '?'. Since the input is a number, there are no spaces or '?', so the last character is the last character of the string.\n\nThen check if that character is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nlast_char = s(LEN_TRIM(s):LEN_TRIM(s))  ! Get last character.\n\nConvert to lowercase: last_char = CHAR(ICHAR(last_char) + 32) if uppercase.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to lowercase:\n\nIF (last_char >= 'A' .AND. last_char <= 'Z') THEN\n   last_char = CHAR(ICHAR(last_char) + 32)\nEND IF\n\nThen check if it is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nIf yes \u2192 output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the result of the second step is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThen, the third program's processing:\n\nTake the second's output (a string, either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and process it.\n\nThe third program's logic is to check if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nWait, the third program's code counts the occurrences of each character. So for \"YES\", the counts are Y:1, E:1, S:1 \u2192 so the counts are not 2. So the third program outputs \"No\".\n\nFor \"NO\", counts are N:1, O:1 \u2192 two characters, each once \u2192 so again, not two occurrences each. So output \"No\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"No\".\n\nSo in code, the third step's processing:\n\nTake the string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\") and count the characters.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninput_str = second_result (either \"YES\" or \"NO\")\n\nInitialize a count array for each character. Since Fortran doesn't have a hashmap, perhaps use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) or just track the counts for the characters present.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are short, we can process manually.\n\nBut to code it properly:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=*) :: input_str = \"NO\" (for example)\n\nINTEGER, DIMENSION(256) :: counts = 0\n\nDO i = 1, LEN_TRIM(input_str)\n   c = input_str(i:i)\n   counts(ICHAR(c)) = counts(ICHAR(c)) +1\nEND DO\n\nThen check:\n\nnumber_of_chars = 0\nall_counts_two = .TRUE.\n\nDO i = 1, 256\n   IF (counts(i) >0) THEN\n      number_of_chars = number_of_chars +1\n      IF (counts(i) /=2) all_counts_two = .FALSE.\n   END IF\nEND DO\n\nIF (number_of_chars ==2 .AND. all_counts_two) THEN\n   output = \"Yes\"\nELSE\n   output = \"No\"\nEND IF\n\nBut for \"NO\", counts for N and O are 1 each \u2192 number_of_chars is 2, but counts are 1 \u2192 so output is \"No\".\n\nThus, the third step's output is \"No\".\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the initial y from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (i).\n\n3. Convert i to a string s.\n\n4. Process s through the second step's logic to get second_result (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n5. Process second_result through the third step's logic to get final_output (\"No\").\n\nThen, print final_output.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the leap function.\n\nFUNCTION is_leap(y) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: y\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  res = MOD(y,400) == 0 .OR. (MOD(y,4) ==0 .AND.

Output the third result\n  PRINT *, third_result\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but in the third step, the input is the second_result (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"). Let's see:\n\nFor \"YES\", the length is 3. The characters are Y, E, S (but in the second_result, it's stored as \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase? Wait, in the second program's code, the input is the string from first's output (the year as a string, which is numeric, so all characters are digits). The second program converts the last character to lowercase. But in the code above, the second_result is set to \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase? Wait, in the code above, the second_result is set to \"YES\" or \"NO\" as strings. Wait, in the code for the second program's logic:\n\nThe second_result is initialized to \"NO\", then if the condition is met, it becomes \"YES\". But in the code above, the second_result is stored as \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase? Because the code in the second program's logic in Java outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase. So in the Fortran code, the second_result is \"YES\" or \"NO\" in uppercase.\n\nWait, in the second program's code, the output is System.out.println(\"YES\") or \"NO\". So the strings are uppercase. So in the third program's processing, the input is \"YES\" (3 letters) or \"NO\" (2 letters).\n\nWait, \"NO\" is two characters. Let's see for \"NO\":\n\nThe counts for 'N' (ASCII 78) and 'O' (79) would be 1 each. So the counts are 1, so the third program's check would see that the counts are not 2, so output \"No\".\n\nThus, the code above should work.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, the third_result is initialized to \"No\", and only set to \"Yes\" if the conditions are met. Since in all cases, the conditions are not met, the output is \"No\".\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 2020 (i=2020). Then the second_result is \"NO\". The third program's processing of \"NO\" gives counts for N and O each 1 \u2192 so third_result is \"No\".\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 2021 \u2192 second_result is \"NO\" \u2192 third outputs \"No\".\n\nThus, the final output is always \"No\".\n\nBut the code is correct as per the logic.\n\nNow, check for possible errors in the code.\n\nIn the first part, the loop starts with i = y+1, and increments each time. The loop is a DO loop without an end, which in Fortran is an infinite loop. The EXIT is when the condition is met. That's correct.\n\nThe leap function is correct.\n\nThe conversion of the integer to string: using WRITE(s, '(I0)') current_year. The ADJUSTL(s) is to remove leading spaces, since the WRITE might have leading spaces if the number is shorter than 10 digits. But since current_year is an integer, the I0 format should write it without leading spaces. However, ADJUSTL ensures that any leading spaces are removed, so the LEN_TRIM(s) gives the correct length.\n\nThe second program's logic: the last character is taken from the end of the string. Since the input is a number, there are no spaces or '?', so the last character is correct.\n\nThe second_result is set to \"YES\" or \"NO\" correctly.\n\nThird program's processing:\n\nThe counts array is initialized to zero. Then, for each character in second_result, we count their occurrences. Then, check if exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2.\n\nWait, in the code above, the third program's code:\n\ncounts(c) is for each ASCII code. So for \"NO\", the characters are 'N' (ASCII 78) and 'O' (79). Their counts are 1 each. So num_chars is 2, but all_two is 0 (since counts are 1). So third_result remains \"No\".\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let me write the final Fortran code."
