    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K from input. It does some calculations to find the minimal number of times you have to multiply 10 by itself modulo K to get 1 again. The result is printed. But if K is even or divisible by 5, it returns -1. Wait, but the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. Hmm, but the first program's output is an integer. The second program expects a string input. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the solve() result, which is an integer. The second program takes a string input (since it reads a line and replaces commas). So how does the first program's output become the input to the second? Oh, right, the output of the first is the input to the second. So the first program's output (integer) must be converted to a string, then passed as input to the second program, which processes it (replacing commas with spaces?), then the third program takes that output as input again. Wait, but the second program's output is the processed string, which then becomes the input to the third program. The third program then reads that string and processes it.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is an integer. Let me see the first program's solve function. Let me look at the code again. The first program's solve function returns an integer. So the first program's output is that integer printed. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 7, then the second program reads \"7\" as input, then replaces commas with spaces. But since there are no commas, it just outputs \"7\". Then the third program takes that \"7\" as input, processes it, and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC051_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        String a = br.readLine();\n        sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n        System.out.println(sb);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs that. So if the first program's output is, say, 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which has no commas, so it outputs \"123\". Then the third program takes that as input. The third program reads a string, counts the number of characters with odd counts, and decides \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nInput -> first program (output integer) -> second program (output same string, unless there were commas) -> third program (output \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nWait, but the first program's output is an integer. So the first program's output is printed as a string. So the second program's input is that string. So the second program's output is that same string (unless there were commas in the first program's output, but since it's an integer, there won't be commas). So the third program's input is the same as the first program's output as a string.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is the first's output string. So the third program will process that string. Let me see the third program's code:\n\nThird program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, counts the frequency of each character. Then counts how many have odd counts. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's an odd number (but wait, the condition is \"if (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0)\", so if oddCount is even, then it's \"Second\". Wait, let me parse the condition again:\n\nThe code says:\n\nif (oddCount <= 1 || oddCount % 2 != 0) {\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n} else {\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe condition is: if oddCount is less than or equal to 1, OR if oddCount is odd (since oddCount mod 2 !=0). So if oddCount is 0, 1, 3,5, etc., then it's \"First\". Only when oddCount is even and greater than 1, then \"Second\".\n\nWait, for example, if oddCount is 2, then the condition is false (since 2>1 and 2 mod2=0), so it goes to else, \"Second\".\n\nSo the third program's output depends on the input string's character counts.\n\nNow, the problem is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The key is to process the input through all three steps without I/O in between.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the input (the first program's input is an integer K). So in Fortran, we need to read that integer.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (solve function) to get the integer result.\n\n3. Then, take that integer, convert it to a string (as the second program's input would be that string), then process the second program's logic (replace commas with spaces). Since the first program's output is an integer, the string will have no commas, so the second step's output is the same as the first's output as a string.\n\n4. Then, take that string (from step 3's output) and process the third program's logic (count characters' frequencies, etc.)\n\nFinally, output the third program's result.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial integer K.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (the solve function's return value).\n\n- Convert that result to a string (since that's the input to the second program).\n\n- Process the second program's step (replace commas with spaces in the string). Since the first's output is an integer, the string won't have commas, so this step is a no-op here, but must be done in code.\n\n- Then, process the third program's logic on the resulting string (from step 3).\n\n- Finally, output the third program's result.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the string after replacing commas with spaces. So even if there are no commas, it's still the same string. So in code, the second step's processing is just replacing commas with spaces, but in our case, the first's output is an integer, so the string has no commas, so the second step's output is the same as the first's output as a string.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\nRead K.\n\nCompute the first program's solve function (the integer result).\n\nConvert that integer to a string (call it s).\n\nProcess the second step: replace any commas in s with spaces. (But since s is a number, no commas, so s remains the same.)\n\nProcess the third step: take s as input string, count character frequencies, compute odd counts, decide \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nNow, let's think about each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first program's solve function.\n\nThe first Java program's solve function:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, K is read via readInt(). But in the Fortran program, the first step is to read K from input. So in the Fortran code, the first step is to read K, then process the first part.\n\nWait, in the original Java sequence, the first program's input is K, which is read via readInt(). So in the Fortran code, the first step is to read K from the user.\n\nThen, the first part's processing is:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5: if yes, return -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7: if yes, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply K by 9.\n\nThen find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1. The remainder starts at 10 mod K, then each step multiplies by 10 mod K. The loop continues until remainder is 1.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, remainder = 10 mod K.\n\nThen, while remainder !=1:\n\nans increments, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans is the number of steps needed.\n\nSo the first part's result is ans, unless K is even or divisible by 5, in which case it's -1.\n\nWait, but in the code, after K is divided by 7 (if divisible by 7), then K is multiplied by 9. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9.\n\nWait, so the K is modified here. So the code first checks if K is divisible by 7, then divides by 7, then multiplies by 9. So the new K is (original K divided by 7 if divisible) multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think. The problem might be from the original problem, but perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's logic. Since I have to translate the code as is, I need to follow exactly.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part's processing is:\n\nRead K.\n\nif mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5)==0, then the result is -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then K = K /7\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nthen compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1.\n\nWait, but the code in Java does K *=9 after possibly dividing by 7. So the K is modified here.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nSo the new K is (original K divided by 7 if divisible) multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but why? Let me see the code again. The code is part of the solve function. So the K here is the input K (from readInt()), but after possible division by 7, then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that. Anyway, the code must be translated as is.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part's processing is:\n\nRead K.\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n    result = -1\n\nelse\n\n    if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n        K = K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    K = K *9\n\n    ans =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n    end do\n\n    result = ans\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the code, after K is divided by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9. So the K is modified here. So the code's K is changing.\n\nWait, but in the code, the original K is read, then modified. So in Fortran, we need to make a copy of K before modifying it, or track it properly.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nOriginal K is read. Then, if divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. So the K used in the loop is the modified K.\n\nSo in Fortran, let's see:\n\nLet me write variables step by step.\n\nFirst, read K_initial from input.\n\nThen:\n\nif (mod(K_initial,2) ==0 or mod(K_initial,5)==0) then\n\n    result = -1\n\nelse:\n\n    K = K_initial\n\n    if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n        K = K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    K = K *9\n\n    ans =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n    end do\n\n    result = ans\n\nend if\n\nSo that's the first part's processing.\n\nNow, the result of the first part is an integer. Let's call this first_result.\n\nThen, the second step is to process this first_result as a string, replacing commas with spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. For example:\n\ninteger :: first_result\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') first_result\n\nThen, process s to replace commas with spaces. But in the case of the first_result being a number, there are no commas, so s remains the same. But the code must do the replacement.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write an integer to a string, it won't have commas unless the number is written with a format that includes commas. The default I0 format doesn't add commas. So the string s will just be the digits of first_result. So the replacement is a no-op here, but the code must still perform it.\n\nSo the second step's processing is:\n\nTake the first_result, convert to string s.\n\nThen, replace any commas in s with spaces. So in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, using a replace function. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in replace function, so we have to loop through each character.\n\nAlternatively, using a loop:\n\ninteger :: i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n... (after writing first_result to s)\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the second step's processing. The result is the modified string s.\n\nThen, the third step is to process this string s through the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's code is:\n\nRead a string (the input from second program's output, which is s here).\n\nCount the frequency of each character.\n\nCount how many have odd counts (oddCount).\n\nThen, if oddCount <=1 or oddCount is odd, output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to process the string s, count each character's frequency, then compute oddCount.\n\nFirst, the string s is the input to the third step. So in Fortran, after the second step, s is the string to process.\n\nWe can process each character in s:\n\nInitialize a frequency array. Since characters can be any, but in the problem's context, it's probably uppercase, lowercase, or digits. But to be safe, we can use a hash map or an array for ASCII characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps using a hash map is tricky. Alternatively, since characters are limited, we can use an array for each possible ASCII character.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a string, we can loop through each character and count.\n\nLet me think of using a derived type or a hash map. Alternatively, since Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map, perhaps using an array of integers for each possible ASCII character.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe can have an array of size 256 (for ASCII) initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for each character in s:\n\nindex = ichar(c)\n\nfreq(index) = freq(index) +1\n\nThen, after counting, loop through all characters in the string (or all entries in freq array) to count how many have odd counts.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to loop through each character in the string and track frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is s, which is the output of the second step, which is the first_result converted to a string (so digits only, unless the first_result was -1, which is possible).\n\nWait, the first program's solve function can return -1. So first_result could be -1, which when converted to a string would be \"-1\".\n\nSo the string s could be \"-1\", \"7\", \"123\", etc.\n\nSo the third program's input is that string. So the characters are the digits and possibly '-'.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step's processing:\n\nInitialize an array to count frequencies.\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: freq = 0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n... (after second step's processing)\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    c = s(i:i)\n\n    index = ichar(c)\n\n    freq(index) = freq(index) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, count how many entries in freq have an odd count.\n\ninteger :: oddCount =0\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n    if (freq(i) >0 .and. mod(freq(i),2) ==1) then\n\n        oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but actually, we need to check all characters present in the string. Alternatively, since the freq array is initialized to zero, any character in the string will have a non-zero count. So the loop over all 256 entries is okay.\n\nThen, after computing oddCount, decide the output.\n\nif (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n\n    output = \"First\"\n\nelse\n\n    output = \"Second\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, the condition in Java is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then \"First\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) /=0) ) then\n\n    result = \"First\"\n\nelse\n\n    result = \"Second\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nSuppose oddCount is 3 (which is odd), then condition is true.\n\nIf oddCount is 2 (even), then condition is false.\n\nIf oddCount is 0, then condition is true (since 0 <=1).\n\nIf oddCount is 1, condition is true.\n\nSo the logic is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial integer K.\n\n2. Compute first_result via the first program's logic.\n\n3. Convert first_result to a string s, replace commas with spaces (though in this case, no commas).\n\n4. Process s through the third program's logic to get the final output.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read K from input. Let's declare K as integer.\n\nThen, compute first_result.\n\nThen, convert first_result to a string s.\n\nThen process s to replace commas with spaces.\n\nThen process s to count frequencies and compute oddCount.\n\nFinally, decide the output.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: K, first_result, oddCount, i, index, ans, remainder, temp_K\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: freq = 0\n\n    ! Step 1: Read K\n    read(*,*) K\n\n    ! Step 2: Compute first_result\n    if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n        first_result = -1\n    else\n        temp_K = K\n        if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n            temp_K = temp_K /7\n        end if\n        temp_K = temp_K *9\n        ans =1\n        remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n        do while (remainder /=1)\n            ans = ans +1\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n        end do\n        first_result = ans\n    end if\n\n    ! Step 3: Convert first_result to string s and replace commas with spaces\n    write(s, '(I0)') first_result\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n            s(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Step 4: Process s to count frequencies and compute oddCount\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        index = ichar(s(i:i))\n        freq(index) = freq(index) +1\n    end do\n\n    oddCount =0\n    do i =0,255\n        if (freq(i) >0 .and. mod(freq(i),2) ==1) then\n            oddCount = oddCount +1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Determine the output\n    if ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) /=0) ) then\n        write(*, '(A)') \"First\"\n    else\n        write(*, '(A)') \"Second\"\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, in the first part, when K is divided by 7, but what if K is 0? Well, the problem probably ensures K is a positive integer, but in code, division by 7 is okay as long as K is divisible by 7.\n\nAnother point: in the first part, when K is modified to temp_K, which is K divided by 7 (if divisible) then multiplied by 9. So temp_K is used in the loop.\n\nWait, in the code, after dividing by 7 (if needed), temp_K is multiplied by 9. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother point: the remainder starts at 10 mod temp_K. Then, each step multiplies by 10 mod temp_K. The loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans is the number of steps needed.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the string conversion: using write(s, '(I0)') first_result. That should work, converting the integer to a string without commas.\n\nThen replacing commas with spaces. Since there are none, it's okay.\n\nThen, processing the string s.\n\nThe frequency array is initialized to zero. Then, for each character in s, we get its ASCII code and increment the count.\n\nThen, oddCount counts how many characters have an odd count.\n\nFinally, the condition is checked.\n\nNow, test case examples.\n\nSuppose input K is 7.\n\nFirst program's solve:\n\nCheck if 7 is even or divisible by 5: no.\n\nCheck if divisible by 7: yes. So temp_K =7/7=1. Then multiply by 9: temp_K=9.\n\nans starts at 1, remainder =10 mod9 =1. So remainder is 1, so loop doesn't run. So ans is 1. So first_result is 1.\n\nThen, s is \"1\".\n\nSecond step: no commas, so s remains \"1\".\n\nThird step: the string is \"1\".\n\nThe frequency of '1' is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1.\n\nCondition: 1 <=1 \u2192 true \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\".\n\nAnother test case: K=3.\n\nFirst program:\n\n3 is not even or divisible by 5.\n\nCheck divisible by7? No. So temp_K =3*9=27.\n\nans starts at 1, remainder =10 mod27 =10.\n\nLoop:\n\nans increments to 2, remainder =10*10 mod27 \u2192 100 mod27 is 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 remainder 19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27: 27*7=189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder 1.\n\nSo loop stops. ans is 3.\n\nSo first_result is 3 \u2192 s is \"3\".\n\nThird step: \"3\" has frequency 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother test case where first_result is -1.\n\nSuppose K=2 (even). Then first_result is -1.\n\ns becomes \"-1\".\n\nProcessing the string \"-1\":\n\nCharacters are '-', '1'.\n\nFrequencies: '-' \u21921, '1' \u21921. Both odd counts. So oddCount=2.\n\nCondition: 2>1 and even \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nSo the output would be \"Second\".\n\nAnother test case where first_result is 7 (so s is \"7\").\n\nThen, the string \"7\" has frequency 1 \u2192 oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case where first_result is 123 (so s is \"123\").\n\nCharacters '1','2','3' each count 1 \u2192 oddCount=3 (since 3 is odd). So condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case where first_result is 1234 \u2192 counts are all 1 \u2192 oddCount=4 (even). So condition is 4>1 and even \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nWait, 4 is even, so mod(4,2)=0 \u2192 condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\n- K=1: Let's see.\n\nFirst program:\n\nK=1 is not even or divisible by5.\n\nCheck divisible by7? No. So temp_K =1*9=9.\n\nans starts at 1, remainder=10 mod9=1 \u2192 so remainder is 1. So ans is 1. So first_result is 1 \u2192 s is \"1\".\n\nThird step: oddCount=1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case where K=7*5=35 \u2192 but since K is divisible by5, first_result is -1 \u2192 s is \"-1\".\n\nThen, the string \"-1\" has two characters with odd counts (each 1). So oddCount=2 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nAnother case where first_result is 0 (but can that happen? Let's see.\n\nWait, first_result is either -1 or the ans from the loop. The loop's ans starts at 1 and increments until remainder is 1. So ans can't be 0. So first_result can't be 0. So s can be \"-1\", \"1\", etc.\n\nAnother case where first_result is 0 (but that's impossible here).\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the write statements for the final output must be exactly \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nThe code uses write(*, '(A)') \"First\" which should work.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\n- The temp_K variable is needed to hold the modified K.\n\n- The variables ans, remainder are local to the first part's computation.\n\n- The freq array is 0:255, which is 256 elements. That's okay.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The length of the string s. The first_result can be up to, say, very large. But in the first program's code, the loop runs until remainder becomes 1. The maximum possible ans would depend on K. But in Fortran, the string length is set to 20, which should be sufficient for typical cases. If the first_result is very large (like 1e6 digits?), but in practice, the problem constraints probably limit K to a reasonable size. Since the original Java code uses integers, which are 32-bit, so the maximum first_result would be up to 1e9 or so, which as a string is 10 digits. So 20 is enough.\n\nAnother possible issue: when writing the first_result to s, if it's negative (like -1), the string will include the '-' sign. Which is correct, as in the example above.\n\nThus, the code should work."
