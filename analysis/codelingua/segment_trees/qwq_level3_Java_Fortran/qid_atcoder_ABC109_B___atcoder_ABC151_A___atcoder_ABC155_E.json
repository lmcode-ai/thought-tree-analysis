    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC109_B) reads N strings, checks if each subsequent string starts with the last character of the previous one, and ensures all are unique. It outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string, reads the first character, and prints the next character in the ASCII sequence. Wait, but the code here is a bit confusing. The main method reads a line, then prints the first character plus 1. Wait, the code says System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);. So if the input is \"a\", it would output \"b\". But the second file also has a class RemRing, but the main method doesn't use it. Maybe that's part of another problem? Wait, the user provided three Java files, but the second one's main is in atcoder_ABC151_A. The RemRing class might be part of another problem but not used here. Since the user says the programs are executed in sequence, the second program's output is the input to the third. Wait, but the second program's code only takes the first character and increments it. So the output of the second program is a single character, which is the next ASCII character of the first character of its input. But the third program (atcoder_ABC155_E) expects a number as input. Hmm, this might be a problem. Wait, let me check the third program's code.\n\nThe third Java program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a number as a string, processes its digits to compute some bills. So the input to the third program must be a number string. But the second program's output is a single character, which is a character code. For example, if the second program's input is \"a\", it outputs \"b\", which is a character, but the third program expects a number. That might be an issue. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. The second program takes that input (the string \"Yes\" or \"No\"), reads the first character (either 'Y' or 'N'), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character. Then the third program takes that single character as input, which is a number? Wait, but the third program expects a number string. For example, if the second program outputs 'Y' (ASCII 89), then the third program would get \"Y\" as input, which is not a number. That would cause an error. But maybe the problem is designed such that the sequence works? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the second program's code is different. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code's main method:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC151_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in), 1);\n        String s;\n        String sl[];\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nAh, right. So it reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. So if the input is \"Yes\", then the first character is 'Y' (ASCII 89), so adding 1 gives 90 which is 'Z', so output is 'Z'. Then the third program takes that 'Z' as input, but the third program expects a number. That would be a problem. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the sequence? Or perhaps the second program is supposed to process the first program's output correctly. Alternatively, maybe the second program is part of a different problem and the sequence is not correct. But according to the user's instruction, I have to translate the entire sequence as given. So perhaps the third program is supposed to process the output of the second, even if it's a character. Let me see the third program's code.\n\nThird program's main:\n\nScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\nString number = sc.next();\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n}\n\nSo it reads a string, which is supposed to be a number. So if the input is a non-digit character like 'Z', this would cause an error. But the user's problem says to translate the sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves the same. So perhaps the original sequence is designed such that the second program's output is a digit? For example, if the first program outputs \"Yes\" (which is a string), then the second program takes the first character 'Y' (ASCII 89), adds 1 to get 90 (Z), which is not a digit. So the third program would crash. But maybe the first program's output is a number? Wait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are strings. So this seems like a problem. But perhaps the user intended that the second program's output is a number? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe the second program is part of a different problem and the sequence is not correct. But since the user provided the code, I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nHmm, perhaps the second program is supposed to process the first program's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\", then output a character, and the third program takes that character as input. But the third program expects a number. So this would be an error. But the user wants the Fortran program to replicate the same behavior. So perhaps the third program would crash, but in the Fortran code, I have to replicate that behavior. Alternatively, maybe the second program's code is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java code again, the main method is in atcoder_ABC151_A. The code reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1, and outputs that character. So the output is a single character. The third program expects a number as input. So if the input is a non-digit, the third program would fail. But the user's instruction says to translate the sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves the same. So perhaps the third program's code is supposed to handle that? Let me see the third program's code again.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nIt reads a string (number = sc.next()), then processes each character as digits. So if the input is a non-digit, like 'Z', then number.charAt(0) would be 'Z', and when subtracted by '0' (ASCII 48), it would be 90 - 48 = 42, which is not a digit. So the code would proceed, but the digits array would have 42, which is beyond 0-9. The code would then process that, but the problem's logic might not be correct. However, the user wants the Fortran code to replicate the same behavior, so even if it's an error, the Fortran code must do the same steps.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that the sequence is as given, even if it leads to invalid input for the third program, the Fortran code must replicate the same steps.\n\nNow, the task is to combine all three Java programs into a single Fortran program. The first program's input is from stdin, the second uses the first's output, the third uses the second's output, and the third's output is the final output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read input (from stdin) as the first Java program does.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (checking the strings and outputting \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n3. Then, take that result (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and process it through the second Java program's logic (take first character, add 1, output the character).\n\n4. Then, take that character and process it through the third Java program's logic (treat it as a number string, process digits, output the bills count).\n\nBut in Fortran, all this must be done in a single program without intermediate I/O except first read and last output.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read N and the N strings (from stdin).\n\n- Process the first program's logic to get \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n- Then, take that string, process the second program's logic (first character +1, get a character).\n\n- Then, process the third program's logic using that character as the input string.\n\n- Finally, output the result of the third program.\n\nWait, but the third program expects a number string. So if the second program's output is a character like 'Z', then the third program's code would process it as a digit (even though it's not a digit). The Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nNow, let's think about each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nThe first program reads N, then N strings. It checks two conditions:\n\n1. Each string's first character must be the last character of the previous string (except the first).\n\n2. All strings must be unique.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn Fortran, I can store the strings in an array. Let's see:\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- N as integer.\n\n- An array of strings (each string is a character array).\n\n- Check for uniqueness: perhaps using a hash, but in Fortran, perhaps a list and check each new entry against existing ones.\n\nWait, but in Java, they used a HashMap to track past entries. Since in Fortran, we can have an array of strings and check for duplicates by comparing each new string with all previous ones.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead N, then read N strings into an array.\n\nCheck for uniqueness: for each i from 0 to N-1, check if any previous string is the same as current.\n\nAlso, check the sequence condition: for each i from 1 to N-1, the first character of current string must be the last character of previous string.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, set ans to false.\n\nNow, the second program's logic:\n\nTake the output string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), take its first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that character.\n\nIn Fortran, the first character is the first character of the string. So if the string is \"Yes\", then the first character is 'Y' (ASCII 89), adding 1 gives 90 which is 'Z'.\n\nThe third program's logic:\n\nTake the input (the single character from the second step) as a string, process it as a number.\n\nWait, the third program's code reads the input as a string called \"number\". So in this case, the input is a single character, like 'Z', so the string is \"Z\".\n\nThen, the code processes each character in the string as digits. The code in Java does:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(...) - '0'\n\nSo for 'Z', which is ASCII 90, subtracting '0' (48) gives 42, which is stored as a digit. The code proceeds with that.\n\nThe third program's algorithm is to compute the minimal number of bills needed for some coin system, perhaps? The code's logic is a bit involved. Let me see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe code processes the digits of the input number from right to left (since it's stored in reverse order in the digits array). The algorithm seems to be calculating the minimal number of coins (or bills) needed when converting the number into a different system, perhaps in a way similar to the \"greedy algorithm\" but with some specific rules.\n\nThe code's steps:\n\nInitialize bills to 0.\n\nLoop over each digit (from 0 to length):\n\nIf the current digit is 10 (overflow?), then carry over to next digit.\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value:\n\n- if <5: add digit to bills.\n\n- if ==5: add 5, and check next digit for carry.\n\n- else (>=6): add 10 - digit, and carry over 1.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe digits array is initialized with length+1 elements. The input number is reversed, so digits[0] is the least significant digit.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"123\", then number.length() is 3. The first character (i=0) is number[2], which is '3', so digits[0] = 3. Then i=1: number[1] (second character from end) is '2', so digits[1] = 2. i=2: number[0] is '1', so digits[2] =1. The digits array has length 4 (since number.length()+1?), but in the loop, the loop runs up to i < number.length(). Wait, the digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so digits has length N+1 where N is the input length. The loop runs for i from 0 to N-1 (since i < N). The digits[N] is initialized to 0?\n\nWait, the code initializes digits as new int[number.length() +1], so all elements are 0. Then the loop fills digits[0] to digits[N-1], and digits[N] remains 0. Then in the next loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] =0;\n\n    }\n\n    ... \n\nWait, but how can digits[i] be 10? The initial digits are set to 0 except for the first loop. Wait, in the first loop, digits[i] is set to the digit (0-9). So digits[i] can't be 10. But in the second loop, after processing, digits[i] can become 10?\n\nWait, the second loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] =0;\n\n    }\n\n    ... \n\nWait, perhaps the code has a mistake here. Because in the first loop, digits are set to 0-9. Then in the second loop, when processing, maybe digits[i] can become 10? Let me see the code's logic.\n\nWait, the code's second loop is processing each digit from 0 to N (since number.length() is the original length, so N is the length of the input string). The loop runs from i=0 to i <= N (so up to N). The first condition is if digits[i] is 10, then carry over. But how does digits[i] become 10?\n\nLooking at the code's processing:\n\nIn the second loop, after the first condition, the code proceeds to check the digit's value. For example, when the digit is >=6, the code does:\n\ndigits[i+1]++;\n\nSo, for example, if digits[i] is 6, then after processing, digits[i+1] is incremented by 1, and the bills += 10 -6 =4.\n\nWait, but the code's first step in the second loop is to check if digits[i] is 10. But how does that happen?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is supposed to handle cases where digits[i] can be 10 due to a carry from a previous step. Wait, but in the first loop, digits are set to 0-9. The second loop's first condition is to check if digits[i] is 10, but that can't happen in the first iteration. Unless the code is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to process digits in a way that allows carries. Let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose the input is \"5\".\n\nThen digits array after first loop is [5,0,0] (assuming length is 1, so digits has 2 elements). Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the input is \"5\", so number.length() is 1. The digits array is declared as new int[2], so digits[0], digits[1].\n\nThe first loop runs for i from 0 to 0 (since i <1). So digits[0] = '5' - '0' =5. digits[1] is 0.\n\nThen the second loop runs from i=0 to i <=1 (since number.length() is 1, so i goes up to 1).\n\nFirst iteration i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 5, not 10. So proceed.\n\nCheck if digits[0] <5? No. ==5? Yes. So:\n\nif (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    bills +=5;\n\n}\n\nWait, in this case, digits[i+1] is digits[1], which is 0. Since 0 <5, so no increment. So bills +=5. Then proceed.\n\nThen, next i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. So check if it's 10? No. Then, since it's <5, add to bills. So total bills is 5+0=5? But the code's output would be 5?\n\nWait, but the problem's third program's purpose is unclear. Maybe it's a problem from a programming contest, but I need to replicate the code's logic exactly.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must replicate the same steps as the Java code.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N and N strings from input.\n\n2. Process the first Java program's logic to get \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take that string, process the second Java's logic (first character +1 ASCII).\n\n4. Take that character as a string, process the third Java's logic to compute the bills.\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- N: integer.\n\n- strings: array of strings (each of length, say, 100 or whatever, but in Fortran, we can use a character array).\n\n- For the first part:\n\nCheck uniqueness and sequence condition.\n\nThen, the second part's output is a single character (the first character of the first part's output plus 1).\n\nThen, the third part's input is that character as a string.\n\nNow, in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read N and the N strings.\n\nThen, process the first part's logic.\n\nThen, process the second part's logic on the first's output.\n\nThen, process the third part's logic on the second's output.\n\nFinally, print the third's output.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nRead N, then read N strings.\n\nCheck for uniqueness and sequence.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: strings(1000)  ! Assuming max N is 1000, but can adjust.\n\ninteger :: N, i, j, ans = 1  ! ans is 1 for yes, 0 for no.\n\nlogical :: is_unique\n\nThen, read N:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nThen read N strings:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n    read(*,*) strings(i)\n\nend do\n\nCheck uniqueness:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n    is_unique = .true.\n\n    do j = 1, i-1\n\n        if (strings(i) == strings(j)) then\n\n            is_unique = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. is_unique) then\n\n        ans = 0\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but also need to check the sequence condition.\n\nAlso, the sequence condition:\n\nCheck for each i from 2 to N:\n\nthe first character of strings(i) must be the last character of strings(i-1).\n\nWait, in Java, the first string is at index 0, so in Fortran, starting at 1, so for i from 2 to N:\n\ncurrent string is strings(i)\n\nprevious is strings(i-1)\n\nCheck if the first character of current is the last character of previous.\n\nSo:\n\nif (ans == 1) then\n\n    do i = 2, N\n\n        if (strings(i)(1:1) /= strings(i-1)(len_trim(strings(i-1)):len_trim(strings(i-1))) ) then\n\n            ans = 0\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the length of a string can be obtained via len_trim. So for the previous string's last character, we need to get the last character of strings(i-1).\n\nSo:\n\nprev_str = strings(i-1)\n\nprev_last_char = prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))\n\ncurrent_first_char = strings(i)(1:1)\n\nif (current_first_char /= prev_last_char) then ... \n\nSo in code:\n\nif (ans == 1) then\n\n    do i = 2, N\n\n        prev_str = strings(i-1)\n\n        prev_last_char = prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))\n\n        current_first_char = strings(i)(1:1)\n\n        if (current_first_char /= prev_last_char) then\n\n            ans = 0\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can have trailing spaces, so len_trim is important.\n\nThus, after checking both conditions, ans is 1 or 0.\n\nThen, the first part's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo, first_result = \"Yes\" if ans ==1 else \"No\".\n\nNow, second part's processing:\n\nTake first_result's first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, then output as a character.\n\nIn Fortran, characters can be converted to integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nSo:\n\nsecond_char = char(ichar(first_result(1:1)) + 1)\n\nWait, first_result is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo first character is 'Y' or 'N'.\n\nAdding 1 gives 'Z' or 'O'.\n\nWait, 'N' is ASCII 78, so +1 is 79 which is 'O'.\n\nSo the second part's output is a single character, stored in second_char.\n\nThird part's processing:\n\nTake the second_char as the input string (number_str).\n\nProcess it as per the third Java program's logic.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe input is a string (number_str), which is the second_char here.\n\nWe need to process each character as digits, reversed.\n\nFirst, get the length of the input string (L = len_trim(number_str)).\n\nThen, create an array digits of size L+1 (since in Java it's length+1).\n\ndigits(1) to digits(L) are the reversed digits, and digits(L+1) is initialized to 0.\n\nWait, in Java, the digits array is of size number.length()+1, so in Fortran, we can have an array of size L+1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with any lower bound. Let's use 0-based for easier handling.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use 1-based.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\ndigits is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so indices 0 to N.\n\nIn Fortran, let's have digits(0:N), where N is the length of the input string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with explicit bounds. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the input string is of length L. Then digits array has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L).\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_len = 20  ! assuming input can be up to 20 characters.\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: second_char\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: number_str\n\nnumber_str = second_char  ! since second_char is a single character.\n\ninteger :: L = len_trim(number_str)\n\ninteger :: digits(0:L)\n\ndigits = 0\n\n! Fill digits array:\n\ndo i = 1, L\n\n    c = number_str(i:i)\n\n    digit_val = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n    digits(i-1) = digit_val\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the Java code reverses the string. Let me check:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo for each position i in 0..L-1 (since number.length() is L), the character is taken from the end.\n\nIn Fortran, the input string is number_str of length L.\n\nTo reverse it:\n\nfor i from 1 to L:\n\n    the character is number_str(L - (i-1)), i.e., the i-th character from the end.\n\nWait, for i=1, it's the last character of the string (position L).\n\nWait, in Java, for i from 0 to L-1:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt( (L-1) -i ) - '0'\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, L-1\n\n    pos = L - i\n\n    c = number_str(pos:pos)\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose L=3, positions 1,2,3 (Fortran strings are 1-based).\n\nFor i=0 (Java's first element):\n\nJava's i=0: number.length() -1 -0 = 2 (third character in 0-based, which is position 3 in Fortran).\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of indices.\n\nJava's number is a string of length L.\n\nJava's loop runs for i from 0 to L-1:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt( (L-1) -i ) - '0'\n\nSo for i=0: the character at position L-1 (last character of the string).\n\ni=1: position L-2 (second last), etc.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is 1-based, so the last character is at position L.\n\nThus, for each i from 0 to L-1 (Java's indices):\n\ndigit index i in digits array corresponds to the character at position (L - i) in the Fortran string.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i=0: position (L-1 -0) = L-1 (0-based), which is position L in Fortran.\n\nJava's i=1: position (L-1 -1) = L-2 (0-based) \u2192 position L-1 in Fortran.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndigits(0) = number_str(L:L) - '0'\n\ndigits(1) = number_str(L-1:L-1) - '0'\n\nand so on.\n\nThus, the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 0, L-1\n\n    c = number_str(L - i : L -i )\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, L -i for i from 0 to L-1 gives L, L-1, ..., 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, after filling digits(0) to digits(L-1), digits(L) is 0 (initialized to 0).\n\nNow, the second loop in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] =0;\n\n    }\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) then bills += digits[i]\n\n    else if (digits[i] ==5) then:\n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) then digits[i+1] +=1\n\n        bills +=5\n\n    else (digits[i] >5):\n\n        digits[i+1] +=1\n\n        bills += 10 - digits[i]\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs from i=0 to i <= number.length().\n\nnumber.length() is L, so the loop runs up to i = L.\n\ndigits has size L+1 (indices 0 to L).\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is from i=0 to L.\n\nWait, but in the first part of the loop (checking for digits[i] ==10):\n\nInitially, digits(0) to digits(L-1) are 0-9 (since they are set from the input characters). digits(L) is 0.\n\nBut after processing, digits[i] can become 10?\n\nWait, in the code's processing steps, when digits[i] is >=6, we do digits[i+1] +=1, which could cause digits[i+1] to become 10?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is designed to handle carries.\n\nWait, let's see the code's steps:\n\nThe loop is over all digits from 0 to L (the last digit is digits(L)).\n\nWait, but in the first part of the loop, if digits[i] is 10, then carry over.\n\nBut how can digits[i] be 10?\n\nPossibly from the processing steps in the same loop.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose in the first iteration (i=0):\n\ndigits[0] is, say, 6.\n\nThen, in the else clause (digits[i] >5):\n\ndigits[i+1] +=1 \u2192 digits[1] becomes digits[1] +1.\n\nThen, bills += 10 -6 =4.\n\nBut digits[0] is set to 6, but after processing, it's not modified except in the first condition.\n\nWait, the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is checked first. So if digits[i] is 10, then carry over.\n\nBut how does digits[i] become 10?\n\nPossibly in the processing steps of the same loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with a mistake, but I have to replicate it exactly.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must follow the same steps.\n\nNow, the third part's processing in Fortran:\n\nInitialize bills to 0.\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to L (since number.length() is L, so i goes up to L).\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: bills =0\n\ndo i =0, L\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        digits(i) =0\n\n    end if\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        end if\n\n        bills = bills +5\n\n    else\n\n        ! digits(i) >5\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the loop, when i reaches L, then digits(i+1) would be digits(L+1), which is out of bounds.\n\nWait, in Java, the digits array is of size L+1 (indices 0 to L). So digits[i+1] when i = L would be digits[L+1], which is beyond the array. But in Java, the array is declared as length L+1, so indices 0 to L. So digits[L+1] would be out of bounds. Wait, that's a bug in the Java code. Wait, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= L; i++) {\n\n    ... \n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhen i is L, then i+1 is L+1, which is beyond the array's size (since it's L+1 elements, indices 0 to L). So this is an array out of bounds error. That's a problem in the original Java code. But the user wants to replicate the behavior, so perhaps in Fortran, we have to handle it as per the code's logic, even if it's a bug.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L). So when i is L, digits[i] is digits[L], and digits[i+1] would be digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So that's a bug. But perhaps the code is correct in some way. Maybe the loop is up to i < L+1, but in the code it's written as i <= L. So the code has a bug. But since the user provided it, I have to replicate it exactly.\n\nIn Fortran, to avoid out of bounds, perhaps the digits array is declared with an extra element. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, the digits array is declared as digits(0:L+1), so that when i is L, digits(i+1) is digits(L+1), which is within the array.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array is size L+1, so digits[L] is the last element. So in Fortran, to replicate the same, perhaps the digits array should be of size L+2, so that when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits(L+1), which is within the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is intended to have the loop up to i < L+1, but written as i <= L. So the loop runs from 0 to L (inclusive), and digits has L+2 elements.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see the original code again.\n\nThe third Java program's code:\n\ndigits is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so for a string of length L, digits has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L).\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to L (inclusive). So when i is L, digits[i] is digits[L], and digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So that's a bug. But perhaps the code is correct in some way. Maybe the loop is supposed to run up to i < L+1, but written as i <= L. So the code has a bug, but the user wants to replicate it. So in Fortran, I have to replicate the same error.\n\nThus, in Fortran, to prevent array out of bounds, perhaps the digits array is declared with an extra element. Let's adjust:\n\ndigits(0:L+1) = 0\n\nThen, when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits(L+1), which is within the array.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:L+1) :: digits\n\ndigits = 0\n\nThen, when filling the digits array:\n\ndo i =0, L-1\n\n    c = number_str(L -i : L -i )\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndigits(L) =0\n\ndigits(L+1) =0\n\nWait, but the original code's digits array is initialized to 0, so digits(L) is 0.\n\nNow, the loop:\n\ndo i =0, L\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        digits(i) =0\n\n    end if\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        end if\n\n        bills = bills +5\n\n    else\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, when i is L, digits(i+1) is digits(L+1), which is allowed.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nFinally, after processing, the bills variable holds the result, which is printed.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N and N strings.\n\n2. Check for the first program's conditions, set ans to 1 or 0.\n\n3. Generate first_result as \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n4. Take first_result's first character, add 1, get second_char.\n\n5. Process second_char as the input to the third program's logic.\n\n6. Output the bills.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nBut let's think about variable declarations and steps.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: strings(1000)  ! Assuming max N is 1000.\n\ninteger :: N, i, j, ans =1, bills\n\nlogical :: is_unique\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_result, second_char\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: number_str\n\ninteger :: L\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n\nNow, step by step:\n\nRead N and strings:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\ndo i =1, N\n\n    read(*,*) strings(i)\n\nend do\n\nCheck uniqueness and sequence:\n\nans =1\n\n! Check uniqueness:\n\ndo i =1, N\n\n    is_unique = .true.\n\n    do j =1, i-1\n\n        if (strings(i) == strings(j)) then\n\n            is_unique = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. is_unique) then\n\n        ans =0\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Check sequence condition:\n\nif (ans ==1) then\n\n    do i =2, N\n\n        prev_str = strings(i-1)\n\n        prev_last_char = prev_str(len_trim(prev_str):len_trim(prev_str))\n\n        current_first_char = strings(i)(1:1)\n\n        if (current_first_char /= prev_last_char) then\n\n            ans =0\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\n! Determine first_result:\n\nif (ans ==1) then\n\n    first_result = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n    first_result = 'No'\n\nend if\n\n! Process second step:\n\nsecond_char = char(ichar(first_result(1:1)) +1)\n\n! Process third step:\n\nnumber_str = second_char\n\nL = len_trim(number_str)\n\nallocate(digits(0:L+1))\n\ndigits =0\n\n! Fill digits array:\n\ndo i =0, L-1\n\n    pos = L -i\n\n    c = number_str(pos:pos)\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndigits(L) =0\n\ndigits(L+1) =0\n\n! Process the digits:\n\nbills =0\n\ndo i =0, L\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        digits(i) =0\n\n    end if\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        end if\n\n        bills = bills +5\n\n    else\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(digits)\n\n! Output the result:\n\nprint*, bills\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the print statement must be correct. Also, need to ensure that all variables are properly declared.\n\nWait, in the code above, 'prev_str' and 'prev_last_char' and 'current_first_char' are character variables. Need to declare them.\n\nAdding declarations:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: prev_str, current_first_char, prev_last_char\n\nWait, but prev_last_char is a single character, so:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: prev_last_char, current_first_char\n\nThus, adding:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: prev_last_char, current_first_char\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nAlso, note that in the uniqueness check, the strings can have varying lengths, but the comparison is done via the entire string.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\n- N=0? Probably not, since the first program reads N as an integer, but in the problem's context, N is at least 1.\n\n- The second program's output is a single character, which is then processed as a number string. Even if it's non-digit, the third program's code proceeds.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code."
