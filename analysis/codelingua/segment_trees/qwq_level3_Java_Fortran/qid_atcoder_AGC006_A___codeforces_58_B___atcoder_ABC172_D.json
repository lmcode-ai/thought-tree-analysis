Since n can be up to 200, 2n is 400, so the declaration of b as len=400 is okay. But in the code above, the variables s1 and str are declared as len=210. But when reading them, if the input strings are longer than 210, it would be a problem. However, according to the first Java program's N=210, perhaps the maximum n is 200, so the strings are 200 characters each, so 210 is sufficient. So the declarations are okay.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC006_A). It reads two strings s1 and str, then constructs an array b by concatenating str followed by s1. Then it computes the failure function (like in KMP algorithm) for this concatenated string. The result is used to calculate 2n - len, where len is the minimum of the last failure value and n. The output is this value.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_58_B) takes an integer n, prints it, then finds the largest divisor of n less than n, prints that, and continues until it can't find any more divisors. Wait, but the code here actually seems to print n followed by each divisor in decreasing order until 1? Wait, the code in the second file is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The code for the second file:\n\nThe main method reads n, then prints n + \" \" (so just n followed by a space?), then loops from i = n-1 down to 1. For each i, if m (which starts as n) is divisible by i, then it prints i and sets m to i. Wait, but m is initially n. So the first check is for i = n-1, if n mod (n-1) is 0? That would only be true if n-1 divides n, which is only possible if n-1 divides 1, so n=2. Otherwise, the first step would not print anything. Hmm, maybe the code is supposed to print all divisors in a certain way. Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to print the sequence of numbers where each divides the previous. Like, starting with n, then the next is the largest divisor less than current, etc. But the code's logic is a bit unclear. Wait, the code for the second file:\n\nThe code starts by printing n followed by a space. Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, if m (which is initially n) is divisible by i, then it prints i and sets m to i. Wait, but m is being updated each time. So the first time, m is n. So for i = n-1, if n mod (n-1) is 0, then yes, only if n-1 divides n. So for n=2, that would be 1, so yes. Then m becomes n-1. Then next i would be n-2, but since m is now n-1, check if (n-1) mod (n-2) is 0? Not sure. But the code's output is the sequence of numbers where each divides the previous. The problem might be to print the sequence of divisors in a chain from n down to 1, but the code's approach may not be correct. However, the user's instruction is to translate the sequence of programs as given, so I have to replicate exactly what the Java code does, not fix any possible bugs.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = sc.nextInt();\n    System.out.println(n + \" \");\n    int m = n;\n    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n        if (m % i == 0) {\n            System.out.println(i + \" \");\n            m = i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first print is \"n + \" \" which would be \"n \" followed by a new line? Because System.out.println(n + \" \"); would print the string \"n \" and then a new line. Then, in the loop, each time it finds an i that divides m (initially n), it prints i followed by a space and a new line, then sets m to i. So the output is a sequence of numbers, each dividing the previous, starting with n, then the next is the largest possible divisor less than current, etc. But the loop is going from n-1 down to 1. So for each i in that range, if m (current value) is divisible by i, then it's printed and m becomes i. So the first i that divides m (starting with m =n) is the first possible divisor less than m. So the first i would be the largest divisor less than m. So the sequence would be n followed by the largest divisor less than n, then the largest divisor of that, etc. So for example, if n is 6, the first step is m=6. The loop starts at i=5. 6 mod 5 is 1, so no. Then i=4: 6 mod4 is 2, no. i=3: 6 mod3 is 0, so yes. So print 3, m becomes 3. Then next i is 2. 3 mod2 is 1, so no. i=1: 3 mod1 is 0, so print 1. So the output would be 6 followed by 3 followed by 1, each with a space and new line. But the first print is \"6 \" followed by a new line. Then 3 followed by space and new line, then 1 same. So the output would be:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nBut the problem is that the second program's output is the input to the third program. Wait, but the user says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Wait, no, the sequence is first, then second, then third. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with each output used as the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, s1, str). Wait, looking at the first Java program's main:\n\nIn the first Java program, the input is read via InputReader. The first input is an integer n, then two strings s1 and str. Wait, the code says:\n\nint n = in.nextInt();\nString s1 = in.next(), str = in.next();\n\nWait, the next() method returns the next token. So the input line would be something like \"n s1 str\", where s1 and str are the next tokens. So the first program's input is three tokens: an integer n, followed by two strings (each possibly with spaces? Well, since next() splits on whitespace, so the strings can't have spaces. So the first program's input is three tokens: n, s1, str.\n\nThe first program's output is 2*n - len, where len is the minimum of f[cnt], n, and n (so just min(f[cnt], n)). The output is that value.\n\nThen, the second Java program takes that output as its input. The second program's input is a single integer (the output of the first program). The second program then outputs a sequence of numbers (as per its code), which is then the input to the third program.\n\nThe third program takes that input (the output of the second program) and processes it. Wait, but the third program's code is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = sc.nextInt();\n    long ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {\n        ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n    }\n    System.out.println(ans);\n}\n\nSo the third program reads an integer n from input, computes some formula, and outputs the result. So the input to the third program is the output of the second program. But the second program's output is a sequence of numbers, each on a line with a space. Wait, the second program's code:\n\nThe first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print the number followed by a space and a new line. Then, for each i in the loop, it does System.out.println(i + \" \"); which again appends a space and a new line. So the output of the second program is a series of lines, each with a number followed by a space. For example, if the first number is 6, then the output would be:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nEach line ends with a space and a new line. So when the third program reads this, it's expecting an integer. But the input to the third program is the output of the second, which is multiple lines. The third program uses Scanner.nextInt(), which would read the first token (the first number, which is the first line's first token). The rest of the lines would be ignored, because the third program only reads the first integer. Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, the second program's output is multiple numbers, but the third program only reads the first one. So the third program's input is the first number from the second program's output. Because the second program's first output is the original n (the input to the second program), then the rest are smaller numbers. So the third program's n is the first number in the second program's output, which is the same as the input to the second program. Wait, the second program's input is the first program's output (let's call it x). The second program's first output is x followed by a space and a new line. Then the rest of the outputs are the divisors. So the third program's input is the first line of the second's output, which is x. So the third program's n is x, which is the output of the first program. Therefore, the third program's result is based on the first program's output.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me retrace:\n\nFirst program's output is a single integer (the result of 2n - len). Let's call this value X.\n\nSecond program takes X as input. It reads it as n (the first line's first token). Then it outputs X followed by a space and a new line, then the rest of the numbers. The third program reads the first integer from the second's output, which is X, so the third program's n is X, and it computes the sum based on that.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's final output is the third program's result, which is based on the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input (for the first Java program): n, s1, str.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (X = 2n - len).\n\n3. Then, simulate the second program's processing of X, which would generate a sequence of numbers, but the third program only needs the first number (X) to compute its result. Wait, no, the third program's input is the entire output of the second program, but it only reads the first integer. So the third program's n is X, so the third program's output is based on X. Therefore, the second program's processing is redundant except for the first number. Wait, but the second program's output is X followed by other numbers, but the third program only reads the first integer. Therefore, the second program's entire processing is irrelevant except for the first number. Wait, but the second program's first output is X followed by a space and a new line. So the third program's input is that first number. Therefore, the second program's processing is actually not needed except for the first output. Wait, but the second program's code is:\n\nThe second program's code takes X as input, then outputs X followed by a space and a new line, then proceeds to output other numbers. But the third program only reads the first integer (X). Therefore, the second program's entire processing is redundant except for the first output. Wait, but the second program's code is required to be part of the sequence. So the Fortran program must process all three steps, but in the intermediate steps, the second program's processing must be done, but since the third program only uses the first number, perhaps the second program's processing can be simplified. However, the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So I must ensure that the second program's processing is done correctly, even if the third program ignores the rest. But in the Fortran program, since we can't have intermediate I/O, we have to process all steps in memory.\n\nSo the steps in the Fortran program would be:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n, s1, str).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (X).\n\n3. Simulate the second program's processing of X, which would generate a list of numbers (starting with X, then the divisors), but since the third program only needs the first number (X), perhaps the second step can be skipped except for the first part. Wait, no, the second program's output is the entire sequence, but the third program only reads the first integer. Therefore, the second program's processing is only needed to produce the first number, which is X. Therefore, the second program's processing can be simplified to just output X, but the original code may have more steps. Wait, the second program's code is:\n\nThe second program's code takes X as input, then:\n\n- prints X followed by a space and a new line.\n\n- then loops from X-1 down to 1, and for each i, if m (initialized to X) is divisible by i, then print i followed by space and new line, and set m to i.\n\nBut the third program only reads the first integer (X). So the rest of the output is irrelevant. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after computing X, the second step can be skipped except for the first part (the first output is X). Therefore, the second program's processing can be ignored except for the first output. Therefore, the third program's input is X, so the third program's result is based on X. Therefore, the entire sequence can be simplified to:\n\nFinal output is the third program's result when given X as input.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can compute X (from first program), then compute the third program's result using X as n. The second program's processing is redundant except for the first output, so we can skip it.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence, so even if the second program's processing is redundant, we have to process it as per the original code. Because the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program's output is the entire sequence, but the third program only reads the first integer. So in the Fortran program, we have to process the second program's code correctly, even if the third program ignores the rest. But since in the Fortran program, there's no I/O between steps, we have to process the second program's code in memory, then pass the first integer to the third program.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is a sequence of numbers. The third program reads the first integer from that sequence. So in the Fortran program, after computing X (the first program's output), we need to process the second program's code, which would generate a list of numbers starting with X, then others. The third program's input is the first number in that list, which is X. Therefore, the second program's processing can be simplified to just outputting X, but the original code may have more steps. Wait, the second program's code does more than that. Let me see:\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt(); // reads X (the first program's output)\n\nThen it prints n followed by a space and a new line.\n\nThen m is set to n (so m = X).\n\nThen loop from i = n-1 down to 1:\n\nfor each i, if m % i ==0, then print i followed by space and new line, and set m =i.\n\nSo the first printed number is X, then the next numbers are the divisors in the way described. But the third program only reads the first integer (X). Therefore, the rest of the processing of the second program is irrelevant for the third program's input. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after computing X, the second program's processing can be skipped except for the first part (the first output is X). Therefore, the second program's processing can be ignored except for the first output. Therefore, the third program's input is X, so the third program's result is based on X. Therefore, the entire sequence can be computed as:\n\nCompute X (first program's output), then compute the third program's result using X as n.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the initial input (n, s1, str).\n\nCompute X via the first program's logic.\n\nCompute the third program's result using X as n.\n\nThen output that result.\n\nTherefore, the second program's processing is redundant and can be skipped. But the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence. So perhaps the second program's code must be executed in the Fortran program, even if it's redundant. Wait, but the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program's output is the input to the third. But the third program only reads the first integer. So the second program's output is a sequence of numbers, but the third program only reads the first. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the second program's processing must be done, but the only part that affects the third program is the first number. Therefore, the second program's processing can be simplified to just outputting X, but the original code may have more steps. However, the problem requires that the Fortran program must behave identically to the original chain. Therefore, the second program's code must be executed in full, even if the third program ignores the rest. But since in the Fortran program, there's no I/O between steps, we have to process the second program's code in memory, then pass the first integer to the third program.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe second program's output is a sequence of numbers. The third program reads the first integer from that sequence. So the rest of the output is irrelevant. Therefore, the second program's processing can be considered as just outputting X followed by other numbers, but the third program only uses X. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after computing X, the second program's processing can be skipped except for the first part. Therefore, the third program's input is X, so the third program's result is based on X. Therefore, the entire sequence can be computed as first program's X, then third program's result with X as n.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead n, s1, str.\n\nCompute X via first program's logic.\n\nCompute third program's result using X as n.\n\nOutput that result.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code can be ignored. But the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence. So perhaps the second program's code must be executed, but since it's only the first number that matters, the rest can be ignored. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after computing X, we can just pass X to the third program's code.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, s1, str.\n\n2. Compute X (first program's result).\n\n3. Compute the third program's result using X as n.\n\n4. Output that result.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code is not needed. But why? Because the second program's output is the input to the third, but the third only reads the first integer. So the second program's output is X followed by other numbers, but the third program only reads X. Therefore, the second program's processing is redundant except for the first part. Therefore, the second program's code can be skipped, and the third program can be given X directly.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written without the second program's code, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence. So perhaps the second program's code must be executed, but in the Fortran program, since there's no I/O between steps, the second program's processing must be done in memory, but the third program only uses the first number. Therefore, the second program's processing can be done, but the only part that matters is the first number. So in the Fortran code, after computing X, we can just pass X to the third program's code.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code can be ignored in the Fortran program, as its only effect is to pass X to the third program. Therefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead the initial input (n, s1, str).\n\nCompute X via first program's logic.\n\nCompute the third program's result using X as n.\n\nOutput that result.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code is not needed. But I need to confirm this.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose the first program's output is 5. Then the second program's output is 5 followed by other numbers. The third program reads the first integer (5) and computes based on that. So the third program's result is based on 5. Therefore, the second program's processing is irrelevant except for the first number. Therefore, the second program's code can be skipped, and the third program can be given X directly.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written without the second program's code. Therefore, the steps are:\n\nFirst program's code (translated to Fortran) to compute X.\n\nThird program's code (translated to Fortran) using X as n.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code can be omitted in the Fortran program.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to translating the first and third programs into Fortran, with the first's output being the input to the third.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence. So perhaps the second program's code must be included, even if it's redundant. But in the Fortran program, since there's no I/O between steps, the second program's processing must be done in memory, but the third program only uses the first number. Therefore, the second program's code can be translated but only the first part is needed. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code is necessary because the third program's input is the entire output of the second program, but the third program only reads the first integer. Therefore, the second program's code must be executed, but in the Fortran program, the second program's processing can be done in memory, and the third program's input is the first integer of the second's output.\n\nTherefore, the steps in the Fortran program would be:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n, s1, str).\n\n2. Compute X (first program's result).\n\n3. Simulate the second program's processing of X, which produces a list of numbers starting with X. The first number is X, so the third program's input is X.\n\n4. Compute the third program's result using X as n.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code can be translated into Fortran, but only the first part (the first number) is needed. Therefore, the second program's code can be simplified to just output X, but the original code may have more steps. However, the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated, so the second program's code must be executed as per the original.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran program, since there's no I/O between steps, the second program's processing must be done in memory. Therefore, the second program's code must be translated into a function that takes X as input and returns the first number (X), but the rest is irrelevant. Alternatively, the second program's code can be translated but only the first part is needed. Let me think of the second program's code in Fortran.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe second program takes an integer X (the first program's output) as input. Then:\n\n- It prints X followed by a space and a new line.\n\n- Then loops from i = X-1 down to 1, and for each i, if m (initialized to X) is divisible by i, then print i followed by space and new line, and set m =i.\n\nBut the third program only reads the first integer (X). Therefore, the rest of the processing is irrelevant. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after computing X, the second program's processing can be skipped except for the first part. Therefore, the third program's input is X, so the third program's code can be run with X as n.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code can be omitted in the Fortran program, as it's redundant. Therefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nRead n, s1, str.\n\nCompute X via first program's logic.\n\nCompute third program's result using X as n.\n\nOutput that result.\n\nTherefore, the second program's code is not needed. So the problem reduces to translating the first and third programs into Fortran, with the first's output being the input to the third.\n\nNow, let's proceed to translate each part.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_AGC006_A):\n\nThe first program reads n, s1, str. Then constructs an array b by concatenating str followed by s1. Then computes the failure function (KMP's failure array) for this concatenated string. The failure array is stored in f. The length of the concatenated string is cnt = 2n (since str and s1 are each length n). Then len is the minimum of f[cnt], n, and n (so just min(f[cnt], n). The output is 2n - len.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nint cnt =0; then for each character in str and s1, they are added to b, incrementing cnt each time. So for str of length n, then s1 of length n, cnt becomes 2n. So the concatenated string is of length 2n. The failure function is computed for this string.\n\nThe failure function f is an array of size N (200+10=210). The code uses 1-based indexing for the array b and f. The getFail function is called with b and cnt (which is 2n). The failure array is computed for the concatenated string.\n\nThe final len is the minimum between f[cnt], n, and n. Since f[cnt] is the value at the end of the failure array, which is the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix. The output is 2n - len.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is 2n - the length of the longest prefix of the concatenated string that is also a suffix.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFortran uses 1-based arrays by default, but can also use 0-based with the right declarations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- s1 and str are strings of length n each.\n\n- The concatenated string is str followed by s1. So in Fortran, we can create a character array of length 2n+1 (since Fortran strings are often 1-based, but need to be careful with indices).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array b is 1-based (since in the loop, they do b[++cnt] = ... starting from cnt=0, so after first increment, it's 1. So the first character is at position 1, up to cnt=2n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can have a character array of size 2n+1 (since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default). Let's see.\n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n, s1, str.\n\nConcatenate str and s1 into a single string (or array) of length 2n.\n\nCompute the failure array for this concatenated string.\n\nThe failure array is computed as per the getFail function.\n\nThen compute len = min(f(2n), n).\n\nOutput 2*n - len.\n\nNow, the getFail function in Java:\n\nstatic void getFail(char b[], int m) {\n    int j = 0;\n    f[0] = f[1] = 0;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {\n        while (j > 0 && b[j + 1] != b[i]) j = f[j];\n        if (b[j + 1] == b[i]) j++;\n        f[i] = j;\n    }\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the array f is of size N (210). The function is to compute f(1) to f(m), where m is the length of the string (2n here).\n\nThe code initializes f(0) and f(1) to 0. But in Fortran, arrays start at 1, so perhaps we need to adjust indices. Wait, in the Java code, the array b is 1-based (since in the loop, the first character is stored at b[1], since cnt starts at 0 and increments before assignment). So in Fortran, the array b can be 1-based, with indices from 1 to 2n.\n\nThe getFail function in Fortran would need to loop from i=2 to m (2n), and for each i, compute j as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nWe can write a subroutine getFail that takes the string b (as a character array), m (the length), and f (the failure array).\n\nNow, the third program (atcoder_ABC172_D):\n\nThe third program reads an integer n (which is the first program's output X), then computes ans as the sum over i from 1 to n of i * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n:\n\nterm = i * (n div i) * ( (n div i) +1 ) / 2\n\nsum all terms.\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to ensure that it's integer division. So in Fortran, (n / i) would be integer division.\n\nTherefore, the third program's code can be translated as:\n\nRead n (the X from first program).\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    q = n / i\n\n    ans = ans + i * q * (q + 1) / 2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n, s1, str.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (X).\n\n3. Compute the third program's result using X as n.\n\n4. Output that result.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, handling the input.\n\nIn Fortran, reading strings can be done with read(*,*) but need to be careful with spaces. Since the input is three tokens: n, s1, str. Each of s1 and str is a string of length n. So the input line would be something like:\n\nn s1 str\n\nwhere s1 and str are each exactly n characters long, with no spaces.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can read them as:\n\nread(*,*) n, s1, str\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length. So we need to declare s1 and str as character arrays of length n. But n is read first, so we can't have a fixed length. Therefore, we need to read n first, then read the two strings with the correct length.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables can be declared with allocatable arrays. So perhaps:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(s1(n), str(n))\n\nread(*,*) s1, str\n\nBut the read statement may have issues with the input format. Alternatively, read the entire line and parse it.\n\nAlternatively, read the first line as a string, then parse it.\n\nAlternatively, use list-directed input. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the input is given as three tokens: first the integer n, then two strings s1 and str, each of length n. So for example, if n=3, the input line could be \"3 abc def\".\n\nThen, in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) n, s1, str\n\nBut s1 and str would be read as strings, but their lengths must be exactly n. However, in Fortran, when using list-directed input, the strings will be read until a space or end of line. So if the strings have no spaces, this should work. But the problem states that the input is three tokens, so this should be okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables s1 and str must be declared with sufficient length. Since n can be up to 200 (since the first program's N is 200+10, but the problem may have n up to 200?), but the code uses N=210. So perhaps n can be up to 200.\n\nWait, the first Java program's N is 200+10, which is 210. So the maximum n is 200, since the problem's input is n, and the strings are of length n. So in Fortran, we can declare s1 and str as character arrays of size 210, but since n is read first, perhaps better to use allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum n is 200, we can declare them as character(210) variables.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter for the maximum size.\n\nLet me proceed with the following steps:\n\nIn the Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 210\n\ninteger :: n, X, i, j, m, len, ans\n\ncharacter(len=maxn) :: s1, str, b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:maxn) :: f ! since in Java, f is 1-based up to 210, but in Fortran, arrays can be 0-based if declared so.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array f is declared as static int f[] = new int[N]; where N is 210. So indices from 0 to 209 (since Java arrays are 0-based). But in the getFail function, they use indices up to m (which is 2n, up to 400?), but since N is 210, perhaps the code is incorrect for n>100. Wait, the first Java program's N is 200+10=210, so the array f can only hold up to 210 elements. But if n is 200, then the concatenated string is 400 characters, so m would be 400, which exceeds the array size. That's a problem. Wait, this is a bug in the original Java code. Because if n is 200, then the concatenated string is 400 characters, but the array f is only size 210. So the code would have an array out of bounds error. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that n is small enough. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct in the problem's context. Since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if it has bugs.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the array f must be of size at least 2n. Since n can be up to 200, the maximum needed is 400. So perhaps set the array size to 400.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter for the maximum possible n. Let's set the maximum to 200, so 2n is 400. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400) :: f\n\nBut in the Java code, the array is 1-based? Wait, in the Java code, the array f is 0-based (since in the getFail function, f[0] is set to 0, and indices go up to m (which is 2n). So in Fortran, to mirror this, we can have f(0:400).\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead n, s1, str.\n\nConcatenate str and s1 into b (a character array of length 2n).\n\nCompute the failure array f for b.\n\nCompute len = min(f(2n), n).\n\nX = 2*n - len.\n\nThen compute the third program's result using X as n.\n\nNow, the concatenation of str and s1:\n\nIn Fortran, the concatenated string can be stored in a character array of length 2*n.\n\nallocate(b(1:2*n))\n\nb(1:n) = str(1:n)\n\nb(n+1:2*n) = s1(1:n)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are stored as arrays, so perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=2*maxn) :: b\n\nBut perhaps better to use arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since str and s1 are each length n, we can create a character array of length 2*n.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read n, s1, str.\n\nThen, create the concatenated string.\n\nNow, the failure function:\n\nsubroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: m\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400), intent(out) :: f\n\ninteger :: i, j\n\nf(0) = 0\n\nf(1) = 0\n\nj = 0\n\ndo i = 2, m\n\n    j = f(j) while (j >0 .and. b(j+1:j+1) /= b(i:i))\n\n    if (b(j+1:j+1) == b(i:i)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end if\n\n    f(i) = j\n\nend do\n\nend subroutine getFail\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string indices are 1-based. So for the character array b, the first character is b(1), second b(2), etc.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {\n\n    while (j > 0 && b[j + 1] != b[i]) j = f[j];\n\n    if (b[j + 1] == b[i]) j++;\n\n    f[i] = j;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\nfor i from 2 to m:\n\n    while j >0 and b(j+1) /= b(i):\n\n        j = f(j)\n\n    end while\n\n    if (b(j+1) == b(i)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end if\n\n    f(i) = j\n\nSo the code in the subroutine would be:\n\nsubroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: m\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400), intent(out) :: f\n\ninteger :: i, j\n\nf(0) = 0\n\nf(1) = 0\n\nj = 0\n\ndo i = 2, m\n\n    do while (j >0 .and. b(j+1:j+1) /= b(i:i))\n\n        j = f(j)\n\n    end do\n\n    if (b(j+1:j+1) == b(i:i)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end if\n\n    f(i) = j\n\nend do\n\nend subroutine getFail\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the substring b(j+1:j+1) is the character at position j+1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe main program:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 210\n\ninteger :: n, X, i, j, m, len, ans\n\ncharacter(len=210) :: s1, str\n\ncharacter(len=400) :: b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400) :: f\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*,*) s1\n\nread(*,*) str\n\n! Concatenate str and s1 into b\n\nm = 2*n\n\nb = trim(str) // trim(s1)\n\n! Compute failure array\n\ncall getFail(b, m, f)\n\n! Compute len\n\nlen = min(f(m), n)\n\nX = 2*n - len\n\n! Now compute the third program's result using X as n\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, X\n\n    j = X / i\n\n    ans = ans + i * j * (j +1) / 2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the concatenated string's length is m = 2*n. The b array must be of length at least m. So in the code above, b is declared as len=400, which is sufficient for n up to 200.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using the concatenation operator //, the resulting string's length is the sum of the two strings' lengths. So if str and s1 are each of length n, then the concatenated string is 2n characters. So the b array must be at least 2n characters. Since n can be up to 200, 2n is 400, so the declaration of b as len=400 is okay.\n\nBut in the code above, the variables s1 and str are declared as len=210. But when reading them, if the input strings are longer than 210, it would be a problem. However, according to the first Java program's N=210, perhaps the maximum n is 200, so the strings are 200 characters each, so 210 is sufficient. So the declarations are okay.\n\nWait, the first Java program's N is 200+10=210, so the arrays are size 210. So the maximum n is 200, so the strings are 200 characters each. So the Fortran variables s1 and str can be declared as len=200, but to be safe, using 210 is okay.\n\nNow, the getFail subroutine must be placed before the main program or inside.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 90, the subroutine can be inside the program.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 210\n\ninteger :: n, X, i, j, m, len, ans\n\ncharacter(len=210) :: s1, str\n\ncharacter(len=400) :: b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400) :: f\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*,*) s1\n\nread(*,*) str\n\n! Concatenate str and s1 into b\n\nm = 2*n\n\nb = trim(str) // trim(s1)\n\n! Compute failure array\n\ncall getFail(b, m, f)\n\n! Compute len\n\nlen = min(f(m), n)\n\nX = 2*n - len\n\n! Compute third program's result\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, X\n\n    j = X / i\n\n    ans = ans + i * j * (j +1) / 2\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\ncontains\n\nsubroutine getFail(b, m, f)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: m\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: b\n\ninteger, dimension(0:400), intent(out) :: f\n\ninteger :: i, j\n\nf(0) = 0\n\nf(1) = 0\n\nj = 0\n\ndo i = 2, m\n\n    do while (j >0 .and. b(j+1:j+1) /= b(i:i))\n\n        j = f(j)\n\n    end do\n\n    if (b(j+1:j+1) == b(i:i)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end if\n\n    f(i) = j\n\nend do\n\nend subroutine getFail\n\nend program main\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose n=1, s1 = \"a\", str = \"a\".\n\nThe concatenated string is \"aa\".\n\nThe failure array for \"aa\" is:\n\nf[0] =0, f[1]=0, f[2] =1 (since the first character is 'a', second 'a' matches the first, so f[2] =1.\n\nlen = min(f[2],1) =1.\n\nX = 2*1 -1 =1.\n\nThird program's result is sum from i=1 to 1 of i*(1//i)*( (1//i)+1)/2.\n\ni=1: 1*1*(2)/2 =1*1*1=1.\n\nSo the output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, s1=\"ab\", str=\"ab\".\n\nConcatenated string is \"abab\".\n\nThe failure array for \"abab\":\n\nLet's compute f manually.\n\nThe string is indices 1-4: 'a','b','a','b'.\n\nf[0]=0, f[1]=0.\n\ni=2:\n\nj starts at 0.\n\nCheck b(1) vs b(2): 'a' vs 'b' \u2192 no. So f[2] =0.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=0.\n\nCheck b(1) vs b(3) \u2192 'a' vs 'a' \u2192 yes. j becomes 1.\n\nf[3] =1.\n\ni=4:\n\nj=1.\n\nCheck b(2) vs b(4): 'b' vs 'b' \u2192 yes. j becomes 2.\n\nf[4] =2.\n\nSo f[4] =2.\n\nlen = min(2,2) \u21922.\n\nX=2*2 -2 =2.\n\nThird program's result with X=2:\n\nsum i=1 to 2:\n\ni=1: 1*(2/1)*(3)/2 \u21921*2*3/2 =3.\n\ni=2: 2*(1)*(2)/2 \u21922*1*1=2.\n\nTotal 3+2=5.\n\nSo output is 5.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFor i=1:\n\nq =2//1 =2 \u2192 term is 1 *2*(2+1)/2 \u21921*2*3/2 =3.\n\ni=2: q=1 \u21922*1*(2)/2 \u21922*1*2/2 =2.\n\nTotal 3+2=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code should output 5.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the second program's code was not included, but according to the logic, it's not needed. The user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence, but since the second program's output is only the first number (X), which is the input to the third program, the second program's code can be omitted.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
