    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_189_A) reads input: n, a, b, c. It uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum number of coins (a, b, c) needed to sum up to n. The output is dp[n], which is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC155_E) takes a string number, processes its digits, and calculates some bills. The input here is a string, but in the original sequence, the input to this program would be the output of the first. Wait, but the first program outputs a number. So the second program's input is that number as a string? Hmm, but the second program expects a number as input, but the first outputs an integer. So the first program's output is an integer, which is the input to the second program. The second program then processes that number as a string of digits. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which is a number, but the second program reads it as a string. So the first program's output is an integer, which is written as a string to the next program's input.\n\nThe third program (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a single character string, and outputs the next character. Wait, looking at the code: it reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that. So if the input is a single character, like 'a', it outputs 'b'. But the input here would be the output of the second program, which is a number (the bills count). So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the third program. The third program takes that string, takes the first character (the first digit of the number), increments it, and outputs that character.\n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output1 (integer) -> Program2 (reads Output1 as a string) -> Output2 (integer) -> Program3 (reads Output2 as a string, takes first character, outputs next char).\n\nNow, the task is to combine all three into a single Fortran program. The first block (Program1) reads input, then processes to compute the first output. Then the second block (Program2) takes that first output as input (as a string), processes it, and computes the second output. The third block (Program3) takes the second output as a string, processes it, and outputs the final result. All without I/O in between.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the input (n, a, b, c) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first result (dp[n]) using the dynamic programming approach from Program1.\n\n3. Take that result (integer) and pass it as a string to the second part (Program2's logic). So convert the integer to a string, then process it as the digits array in Program2.\n\n4. Compute the bills value from Program2's logic.\n\n5. Take that bills value (integer) and convert it to a string, then take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, and output that character.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with Program1:\n\nThe first program's main steps are:\n\n- Read n, a, b, c.\n\n- Initialize dp array of size maxn (4010) with all elements as -infinity except dp[0] =0.\n\n- Then, for each of a, b, c, iterate and update dp[j] as max between current and dp[j - arr[i]] +1.\n\nWait, but the code in Java uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimal number of coins? Wait, actually, the code is trying to find the maximum number of coins? Wait, the code's logic is a bit different. Let me see:\n\nThe code initializes dp[0] =0, and others to -infinity. Then for each coin (a, b, c), it loops j from arr[i] to maxn. For each j, dp[j] = max( current dp[j], dp[j - arr[i]] +1 ). So this is trying to find the maximum number of coins that sum to n? Wait, but that's counterintuitive. Wait, maybe it's the minimal coins? Wait, no, because if you have coins of 1, 2, 3, then for n=3, the maximum coins would be 3 (using three 1's), but the minimal is 1 (using 3). So the code is trying to find the maximum number of coins possible to sum to n. The problem might be from Codeforces 189A, which is \"Cups\" but maybe the problem requires the maximum number of coins? Let me check the problem.\n\nWait, the problem might be Codeforces 189A, but the code's logic is for the problem where you have three cups, and you need to find the maximum number of times you can pour water between them. But perhaps the code here is for a different problem. Anyway, the code's logic is as written. So in Fortran, I need to replicate that.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit declarations. Let me see:\n\nThe first program's variables:\n\nmaxn is 4010. So in Fortran, we can declare an array dp of size 0:maxn. But in Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:4009) :: dp\n\nInitialize all elements to -infinity. But in Fortran, the minimum integer is a problem. Since in Java it's Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is -2^31. But in Fortran, integers can be 4-byte or 8-byte. To replicate that, perhaps we can use a large negative number, like -huge(0). But in the code, the initial dp is set to -infinity, so in Fortran, we can set dp(0:maxn) = -huge(0). But need to make sure that the code can handle that.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop for the coins is:\n\nfor each coin (a, b, c), then for j from arr[i] to maxn-1 (since in Java, the array is 0-based up to maxn-1?), so in Fortran, the loop would be from arr(i) to maxn.\n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is of size maxn (4010), so indices 0 to 4009. So in Fortran, the array would be 0:4009. So the loops would be from arr(i) to 4009.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int j = arr[i]; j < dp.length; j++) {\n\nso j starts at arr[i], and goes up to dp.length-1 (since in Java, arrays are 0-based). So in Fortran, the loop would be from arr(i) to maxn-1 (since maxn is 4010, so 4009 is the last index).\n\nSo in Fortran code for the first part:\n\nRead n, a, b, c.\n\nInitialize dp array to -huge(0), then set dp(0) =0.\n\nThen for each of the three coins (a, b, c):\n\ndo i = 1,3\n\n   coin = arr(i)\n\n   do j = coin, maxn-1\n\n      if (dp(j - coin) +1 > dp(j)) then\n\n          dp(j) = dp(j - coin) +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the coins are stored in an array arr = {a, b, c}. So in Fortran, arr would be an array of size 3, with arr(1)=a, arr(2)=b, arr(3)=c.\n\nWait, in Java, the code is:\n\nint[] arr = {a, b, c};\n\nso in Fortran, we can have an array arr(3) = [a, b, c].\n\nThen, after processing, the first output is dp(n). So the first part's result is dp(n).\n\nNow, moving to the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E):\n\nThe second program takes a number as a string, processes its digits, and calculates bills. The input here is the output of the first program, which is an integer. So in the combined program, the first part's result (dp(n)) is passed to the second part as a string.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing the first result (let's call it res1), we need to convert it to a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's steps:\n\n- Read the number as a string, then reverse the digits (since in the code, the digits array is filled from the end of the string). Wait, in the Java code:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\nSo for i from 0 to length-1, the digits array is filled with the digits in reverse order. For example, if the input is \"123\", then digits[0] is 3, digits[1] is 2, digits[2] is 1. The digits array has length+1 elements (since digits is initialized to length+1). Wait, in Java, the digits array is new int[number.length() +1], so for a string of length L, digits has L+1 elements. The loop runs for i from 0 to L (since the for loop is i <= number.length(); but wait, the code in the second program's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, the digits array is of size L+1, so indices 0 to L. The loop runs from 0 to L (inclusive). But in the code, when i is L, digits[i] is initialized as 0 (since the loop for initializing digits only runs up to i < number.length()).\n\nWait, the code in the second program:\n\ndigits is initialized as new int[number.length() +1]; so all elements are 0 initially. Then, for (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\ndigits[i] = ... \n\nSo digits[number.length()] remains 0.\n\nThen, in the loop over i from 0 to number.length():\n\nfor each i, process digits[i], and possibly carry over to digits[i+1].\n\nWait, but when i reaches number.length(), digits[i] is 0 (initially), but then in the loop, when i is L (the original length), then digits[i] is 0, and digits[i+1] would be digits[L+1], which is beyond the array's size. Wait, but the array is of size L+1, so indices 0 to L. So when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. Wait, that's a bug in the original Java code? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the code again:\n\nThe digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so indices 0 to L (since length is L). The loop for initializing digits runs for i from 0 to L-1 (since i < number.length() (L)), so digits[0] to digits[L-1] are set. digits[L] remains 0.\n\nThen, the loop for processing is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nso i runs from 0 to L (inclusive). So when i is L, digits[i] is 0. Then, in the first condition:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\nBut digits[i] can't be 10 here, since it's initialized to 0. Wait, but in the processing steps, digits[i] can be incremented beyond 10?\n\nWait, let's see the code:\n\nThe first condition is if digits[i] ==10, then carry over to next digit. But how can digits[i] be 10? Because in the first loop, digits[i] is set to the digit (0-9). Then, during processing, when there's a carry, digits[i] can be increased. For example, in the first condition, if digits[i] is 10, then digits[i+1] is incremented, and digits[i] set to 0. But in the loop, when processing digits[i], after possible carry from previous steps, digits[i] can be 10?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed to handle digits that can be 10 or more, and carry over. Let me think through the algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm seems to be processing each digit, handling carries, and accumulating the bills. The exact logic is a bit unclear, but the code's steps are:\n\nFor each digit (starting from the least significant digit):\n\n- If the current digit is 10, then carry over 1 to the next digit, set current to 0.\n\n- Then, depending on the digit's value:\n\n   if <5: add the digit to bills.\n\n   if ==5: add 5, and if the next digit is >=5, carry over 1.\n\n   else (>=6): subtract from 10, add to bills, carry over 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is converting the number into a form where each digit is between 0-9, but with some carry handling, and the bills are the sum of the digits in some way.\n\nBut regardless, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nSo in the combined program, after getting res1 (the first result), we need to convert it to a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\nTake res1 (integer), convert to a string (number_str). Then, reverse the digits (since in the Java code, the digits array is filled in reverse order). Wait, in the Java code, the digits array is filled as:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo the first digit in the array is the last character of the string (the least significant digit). So the digits array is the reversed digits of the input number.\n\nWait, for example, if the input is \"123\", the digits array would be [3,2,1,0], since the length is 3, so digits has 4 elements (indices 0-3). digits[0] =3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, digits[3]=0 (initialized to 0).\n\nWait, the loop for initializing digits runs for i from 0 to 2 (since number.length() is 3, so i <3). So digits[0] is the last character (3), digits[1] is second last (2), digits[2] is first (1). digits[3] remains 0.\n\nThen, the processing loop runs from i=0 to 3 (since number.length() is 3, so i <=3).\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this:\n\nFirst, convert res1 to a string. Let's say res1 is 123, then the string is \"123\".\n\nThen, reverse the characters to get the digits in the order of least significant digit first. So the reversed string is \"321\".\n\nThen, the digits array in Fortran would be an array of length (number_length +1). The digits array elements are the individual digits of the reversed string, plus a 0 at the end.\n\nWait, but in code:\n\nThe digits array in Java is initialized to length+1, so for a string of length L, digits has L+1 elements. The first L elements are the reversed digits, and the last is 0 (initialized to 0).\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Convert res1 to a string (number_str).\n\n2. Reverse the string to get reversed_str.\n\n3. The digits array will have length = len_trim(number_str) +1.\n\n4. Initialize digits array with the reversed digits followed by a 0.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling strings can be a bit tricky. Let's think of steps:\n\nSuppose res1 is an integer. To convert it to a string, we can use write and read.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: number_str\n\nwrite(number_str, '(i0)') res1\n\nnumber_str = adjustl(number_str)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, the reversed string can be created by looping through each character.\n\nAlternatively, we can process each digit directly without converting to a string, but that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, process the number as an integer, extracting digits one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the number as an integer, breaking it into digits.\n\nLet me think: the number is res1. To get its digits in reverse order (LSB first), we can do:\n\ndigits array (integer array) of size (number_length +1).\n\ndigits(1) = res1 mod 10\n\ndigits(2) = (res1 /10) mod10\n\nand so on, until the number becomes 0. Then, the remaining digits are 0.\n\nBut to get the length, we can compute how many digits res1 has.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the number of digits in res1:\n\nn_digits = 0\n\ntemp = res1\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   n_digits = n_digits +1\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, the digits array needs to be of size n_digits +1 (since in Java it's length+1).\n\nWait, but if res1 is 0, then n_digits is 1 (since 0 has one digit). Hmm, but in the code, if the input is \"0\", then the digits array would be [0,0], perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to handle it as follows:\n\nInitialize an array of sufficient size, say 20 elements (since the maximum possible res1 from the first program is 4010, which is 4 digits, so 4+1=5 elements would suffice, but to be safe, 20).\n\ndigits(0:20) = 0\n\nThen, process res1:\n\ntemp = res1\n\ni =0\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   digits(i) = mod(temp,10)\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\n   i =i+1\n\nend do\n\nSo digits(0) is the first digit (LSB), digits(1) next, etc. The remaining digits are 0.\n\nThe length is i (number of digits processed). The digits array has size 20, so the loop can handle up to 20 digits.\n\nThen, the processing loop in the second program is:\n\nbills =0\n\ndo i=0, n_digits  ! Wait, in Java it's up to number.length(), which is n_digits here. So in Fortran, the loop runs from 0 to n_digits (since the array is 0-based here?)\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nnumber.length() is the original length (n_digits). So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=0 to n_digits (since the digits array has n_digits+1 elements? Wait, in the code above, the digits array is 0:20, but the actual digits are stored up to i-1. So the total digits array length is 20, but the actual digits are up to n_digits. So the loop in Fortran would be from i=0 to n_digits (since the original number's length is n_digits, so the digits array has n_digits+1 elements (digits[0] to digits[n_digits], with digits[n_digits] being 0 initially? Or perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the code above, after processing, the digits array has digits(0) to digits(n_digits-1) as the reversed digits, and the rest (digits(n_digits) to 19) are 0. But in the Java code, the digits array is of size L+1 (L is the original length). So in Fortran, the digits array is of size 20, but the loop in the second part would need to process up to the original length plus one?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to track the length properly.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nAfter getting the digits array (digits(0) to digits(n_digits-1)), and the rest are 0, then the processing loop in the second program is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to (original length) (which is n_digits):\n\nWait, the original length is n_digits, so the loop runs from 0 to n_digits (inclusive). So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=0 to n_digits.\n\nWait, but in the code, the digits array has size L+1 (L is the original length). So in Fortran, the digits array is of size 20, but the loop runs up to n_digits (since L is n_digits). So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i =0, n_digits\n\n   current_digit = digits(i)\n\n   if (current_digit ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      current_digit =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (current_digit <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + current_digit\n\n   else if (current_digit ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - current_digit)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code, after checking for current_digit ==10, we set current_digit to 0, but the code in Java does:\n\ndigits[i] =0 after incrementing next digit.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n   digits[i+1]++;\n\n   digits[i] =0;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, after checking if current_digit (digits(i)) is 10, we need to set digits(i) to 0 and increment digits(i+1).\n\nWait, but in the code above, I have:\n\nif (current_digit ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   current_digit =0\n\nend if\n\nBut then, after that, the code proceeds to process current_digit (now 0). But in the Java code, after setting digits[i] to 0, the rest of the processing (the if-else) is done on the new value (0). So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the first condition (digits[i] ==10), the code sets digits[i] to 0, but in the code above, I'm just setting current_digit to 0, but the actual digits array's value is not updated. Oh, that's a problem.\n\nAh right, in the code above, I need to actually set digits(i) to 0, not just the current_digit variable. So the code should be:\n\nif (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   digits(i) =0\n\nend if\n\nThen, proceed with the rest of the processing using the updated digits(i).\n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i =0, n_digits\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   current_digit = digits(i)\n\n   if (current_digit <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + current_digit\n\n   else if (current_digit ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - current_digit)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the else clause (current_digit >5), we add 10 - current_digit to bills, and increment the next digit.\n\nWait, the code in Java for the else part (digits[i] >=6):\n\ndigits[i+1]++;\n\nbills +=10 - digits[i];\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, after processing all digits, the bills variable holds the result of the second program. Let's call this res2.\n\nNow, moving to the third program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n\nThe third program takes a string input (the output of the second program, which is res2 as a string), reads the first character, increments its ASCII value by 1, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, after getting res2 (the integer from the second part), we need to convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, and output that.\n\nSo steps:\n\nConvert res2 to a string (number_str2).\n\nTake the first character (number_str2(1:1)), convert to ASCII code, add 1, then output as a character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str2\n\nwrite(str2, '(i0)') res2\n\nstr2 = adjustl(str2)  ! Remove leading spaces.\n\nif (len_trim(str2) ==0) then\n\n   ! handle zero case, but probably not needed here.\n\nend if\n\nchar = str2(1:1)\n\nchar = char(1) +1  ! Wait, in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to get the ASCII code of a character, use ichar(), and to convert back, use char().\n\nSo:\n\nchar = str2(1:1)\n\nascii_val = ichar(char)\n\nascii_val = ascii_val +1\n\nresult_char = char(ascii_val)\n\nprint *, result_char\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all parts into a single Fortran program.\n\nFirst, read the input for the first program.\n\nThen compute res1 (the first part's output).\n\nThen compute res2 using res1's value.\n\nThen compute the final character from res2.\n\nNow, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n, a, b, c from input.\n\nThen, compute dp array for the first part.\n\nThen, process res1 to get res2.\n\nThen process res2 to get the final character.\n\nNow, let's code step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n, a, b, c.\n\nmaxn =4010\n\nallocate dp array.\n\nInitialize dp(0:maxn) to -huge(0), then dp(0)=0.\n\nThen loop over the coins (a, b, c).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit declarations.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to have a 0-based array, we can declare:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:maxn) :: dp\n\nBut maxn is 4010, so 0:4010.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop for j is from arr(i) to maxn-1 (since in Java, the array is 0-based up to maxn-1).\n\nWait, in the first program's code, the dp array is of size maxn (4010), so indices 0 to 4009. So in Fortran, the array should be 0:4009.\n\nWait, so maxn is 4010, so the array is 0:4009.\n\nWait, perhaps better to set maxn =4010, and the array is 0:maxn-1.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn =4010\n\ninteger :: dp(0:maxn-1)\n\nThen, initializing:\n\ndp = -huge(0)\n\ndp(0) =0\n\nThen, the coins are stored in an array arr(3) = [a, b, c]\n\ninteger :: arr(3)\n\narr(1) =a\n\narr(2)=b\n\narr(3)=c\n\nThen, loop over each coin:\n\ndo i=1,3\n\n   coin = arr(i)\n\n   do j=coin, maxn-1\n\n      if (dp(j - coin) +1 > dp(j) ) then\n\n          dp(j) = dp(j - coin) +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, res1 = dp(n)\n\nWait, but what if n exceeds maxn-1? The original code would have dp[n] as -infinity, but in the problem's context, perhaps n is within the allowed range. Since the first program's code uses maxn=4010, which is probably chosen to be larger than the possible n. So assuming n is within 0 to 4009.\n\nNow, moving to the second part.\n\nCompute res2 from res1.\n\nFirst, process res1 into digits array.\n\nWe need to get the digits of res1 in reverse order (LSB first).\n\nLet me code that part.\n\ninteger :: res1, res2, temp, n_digits, i, current_digit\n\ninteger, dimension(0:20) :: digits  ! enough for up to 20 digits.\n\ndigits =0\n\ntemp = res1\n\nn_digits =0\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   digits(n_digits) = mod(temp,10)\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\n   n_digits =n_digits +1\n\nend do\n\n! Now, n_digits is the number of digits in res1.\n\n! The digits array has digits(0) to digits(n_digits-1) as the reversed digits.\n\n! The processing loop:\n\nbills =0\n\ndo i=0, n_digits  ! since the original length is n_digits, so loop up to n_digits (since digits array has n_digits+1 elements?)\n\nWait, the original length is n_digits (since the number has n_digits digits). So the digits array in Java had length+1 elements. Here, the digits array is 0:20, but the loop in the second part must go up to n_digits (since the original length is n_digits, so the loop runs from 0 to n_digits (inclusive)).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nnumber.length() is the original length (n_digits). So in Fortran, the loop is from i=0 to n_digits.\n\nBut in our digits array, the digits beyond n_digits-1 are 0. So the loop can proceed.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i=0, n_digits\n\n   current_digit = digits(i)\n\n   if (current_digit ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   current_digit = digits(i)  ! after possible update\n\n   if (current_digit <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + current_digit\n\n   else if (current_digit ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - current_digit)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first condition, after setting digits(i) to 0, we need to reassign current_digit to digits(i) again? Or is it okay?\n\nWait, in the code above, after the first if statement (current_digit ==10), we set digits(i) to 0, so current_digit is now 0. But in the code, after that, the code proceeds with the updated digits(i). So the current_digit variable is set again to digits(i) after the first condition.\n\nWait, in the code above, after the first if block (if (current_digit ==10)), we have:\n\ndigits(i) is set to 0, and digits(i+1) is incremented.\n\nThen, current_digit is set to digits(i) again (since after the first if, the code has:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i) \n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, after the first if block, the code proceeds to:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i) \n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, after the first if block (if (current_digit ==10)), the code does:\n\ndigits(i) is set to 0, then the code proceeds to:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i) \n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, the code is:\n\nif (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   digits(i) =0\n\nend if\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i)\n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, the code was:\n\nif (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   digits(i) =0\n\nend if\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i)\n\nWait, no, in the code I had written earlier, the code was:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i)\n\nif (current_digit ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n\n   current_digit =0\n\nend if\n\nBut that's incorrect because it doesn't update the digits array. So the correct code is:\n\nif (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n\n   digits(i) =0\n\nend if\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i)\n\nWait, no, after the first if block, the current_digit is now digits(i), which has been set to 0 if it was 10.\n\nWait, the code should be:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits(i)\n\nif (current_digit ==10) then\n\n   digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n\n   digits(i) =0\n\n   current_digit =0  ! Not necessary, since digits(i) is now 0.\n\nend if\n\nBut then, after that, current_digit is set to digits(i) again?\n\nNo, perhaps better to just use digits(i) directly in the following conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\ndo i=0, n_digits\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   current_digit = digits(i)\n\n   if (current_digit <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + current_digit\n\n   else if (current_digit ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - current_digit)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the else clause (current_digit >5), we have to increment digits(i+1). But in the code, after that, the next iteration will process digits(i+1), so that's okay.\n\nNow, after the loop, bills is the res2.\n\nThen, the third part:\n\nConvert res2 to a string, take first character, add 1, output.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str2\n\nwrite(str2, '(i0)') res2\n\nstr2 = adjustl(str2)\n\nif (len_trim(str2) ==0) then\n\n   ! handle zero case (res2 is 0, so str2 is '0')\n\n   str2 = '0'\n\nend if\n\nchar = str2(1:1)\n\nascii_val = ichar(char)\n\nascii_val = ascii_val +1\n\nresult_char = char(ascii_val)\n\nprint *, result_char\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code.\n\nBut first, note that in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so we need to declare arrays with 0-based indices.\n\nAlso, the first part's dp array needs to be 0-based.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, a, b, c, res1, res2, temp, n_digits, i, current_digit, bills\n\n   integer, dimension(0:20) :: digits\n\n   integer, parameter :: maxn =4010\n\n   integer, dimension(0:maxn-1) :: dp\n\n   character(len=20) :: str2, result_char\n\n   !

Then, current_digit is 0, so added to bills.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs up to number.length(), which is the original length (n_digits). So the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first program:\n\nSuppose n=3, a=1, b=2, c=3.\n\nThe dp array for 3 would be 3 (using three 1's). So res1 is 3.\n\nSecond program: input is \"3\".\n\ndigits array after processing:\n\ndigits(0)=3, digits(1)=0 (since n_digits is 1).\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit is 3 <5 \u2192 add 3 to bills (bills=3).\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills remains 3.\n\nSo res2 is 3.\n\nThird program: input is \"3\" \u2192 first character '3' \u2192 add 1 \u2192 '4'.\n\nSo output is '4'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program's output is 0 (if n=0, then dp[0]=0 \u2192 res1=0.\n\nSecond program processes \"0\".\n\ndigits(0)=0, n_digits=1.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 0 \u2192 add 0.\n\ni=1 (digits(1)=0 \u2192 add 0.\n\nTotal bills 0.\n\nThird program: \"0\" \u2192 '0' +1 \u2192 '1'.\n\nOutput '1'.\n\nAnother test case for second program:\n\nInput number is \"999\".\n\nres1 is 999.\n\ndigits array:\n\ndigits(0)=9, digits(1)=9, digits(2)=9, n_digits=3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 9 \u2192 >=6 \u2192 add 1 (10-9=1), bills=1. digits(1) becomes 10.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is now 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits(2) becomes 10.\n\nThen current_digit is 0 \u2192 add 0.\n\nbills now 1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2) is 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits(3) becomes 1.\n\ncurrent_digit is 0 \u2192 add 0.\n\ni=3:\n\ndigits(3) is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills becomes 2.\n\nWait, let me walk through step by step.\n\nWait, let's process each step for \"999\".\n\nOriginal digits array after processing res1=999:\n\ndigits(0)=9, digits(1)=9, digits(2)=9, digits(3)=0, etc.\n\nn_digits is 3.\n\nLoop from i=0 to 3.\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=9.\n\ncurrent_digit is 9.\n\nSince 9>5:\n\ndigits(1) +=1 \u2192 digits(1) becomes 10.\n\nbills +=1 (10-9=1 \u2192 bills=1.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits(2) +=1 \u2192 digits(2)=10.\n\ncurrent_digit is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills remains 1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2) is 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits(3) +=1 \u2192 digits(3)=1.\n\ncurrent_digit is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills still 1.\n\ni=3:\n\ndigits(3)=1.\n\ncurrent_digit is 1 <5 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills becomes 2.\n\nSo total bills is 2.\n\nSo res2 is 2.\n\nThird program: \"2\" \u2192 '2' +1 \u2192 '3'.\n\nSo output '3'.\n\nHmm, but let me see what the second program would do with input \"999\".\n\nIn Java code:\n\ndigits array is initialized as length+1 (3+1=4 elements).\n\ndigits[0] =9, digits[1]=9, digits[2]=9, digits[3]=0.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9 \u2192 >=6 \u2192 add 1 (10-9=1), bills=1. digits[1] becomes 10.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits[2] becomes 10. bills +=0 (current_digit is 0 now).\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 10 \u2192 set to 0, digits[3] becomes 1. bills +=0.\n\ni=3:\n\ndigits[3] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=2.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran should be correct.\n\nNow, some possible issues:\n\n- The first part's dp array must be initialized correctly. In Fortran, the default initialization for integers is undefined, so setting all to -huge(0) is necessary.\n\n- The loop in the first part must iterate correctly.\n\n- The second part's digits array must be properly filled.\n\n- The third part's string conversion must handle leading zeros correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's loop, when i reaches n_digits, digits(i) is 0 (since the digits beyond n_digits-1 are initialized to 0). So the processing is okay.\n\nAnother test case for the second part:\n\nInput number is \"5\".\n\nres1=5 \u2192 digits(0)=5, n_digits=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit is 5 \u2192 equal to 5.\n\nCheck if digits(1) >=5 \u2192 digits(1) is 0 \u2192 no. So add 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total 5.\n\nSo res2 is 5.\n\nThird part: \"5\" \u2192 '5' +1 \u2192 '6'.\n\nAnother case where digits[i] is 5 and next digit is >=5.\n\nExample: input \"15\".\n\nres1=15 \u2192 digits are 5,1 (since reversed).\n\nn_digits=2.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 5 \u2192 check digits(1)=1 <5 \u2192 so add 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_digit 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=6.\n\nTotal 6.\n\nBut if the input is \"25\":\n\nres1=25 \u2192 digits are 5,2.\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 5 \u2192 check digits(1)=2 <5 \u2192 add 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_digit 2 \u2192 add 2 \u2192 total 7.\n\nBut if input is \"35\":\n\ndigits are 5,3 \u2192 i=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 5 \u2192 check digits(1)=3 <5 \u2192 add 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1: 3 \u2192 add 3 \u2192 total 8.\n\nBut if input is \"55\":\n\ndigits are 5,5 \u2192 n_digits=2.\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit 5 \u2192 check digits(1)=5 >=5 \u2192 so digits(1) becomes 6.\n\nAdd 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_digit 5 (digits(1) was 5, but after increment in i=0's step?\n\nWait, let's walk through:\n\nres1=55 \u2192 digits(0)=5, digits(1)=5, n_digits=2.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_digit is 5.\n\nCheck digits(1) (5) >=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo digits(1) becomes 6.\n\nAdd 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is now 6.\n\ncurrent_digit is 6 \u2192 >=6 \u2192 add 10-6=4 \u2192 bills=5+4=9.\n\ndigits(2) is incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2)=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 10.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, after i=0:\n\ndigits(1) is 6.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_digit is 6 \u2192 >=6 \u2192 add 4 (10-6=4). bills becomes 5+4=9.\n\ndigits(2) is incremented by 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2)=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 10.\n\nSo total bills is 10.\n\nThus, res2 is 10 \u2192 third part outputs '1' +1 \u2192 '2'.\n\nBut let's see what the Java code would do:\n\nInput \"55\".\n\ndigits array is [5,5,0].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is5 \u2192 check digits[1] (5) >=5 \u2192 yes \u2192 digits[1] becomes6.\n\nAdd 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is6 \u2192 >=6 \u2192 add 4 (10-6=4). bills=9. digits[2] becomes1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits[2] is1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 10.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code should be as written above, with proper declarations and loops.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part, the coins are stored in an array arr(3) = [a,b,c]. In Fortran, the array can be initialized as arr = [a, b, c], but need to ensure that the array is properly declared.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier:\n\ninteger :: arr(3) = [a, b, c]\n\nBut in Fortran, when initializing an array with variables, you need to use the syntax arr = [a, b, c], but variables must be constants at compile time? Or is that allowed?\n\nWait, no, in Fortran, you can assign the array after reading a, b, c.\n\nSo better to declare arr as an array of size 3, then assign:\n\narr(1) = a\n\narr(2) = b\n\narr(3) = c\n\nWhich is what I did in the code.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, the loop for j in the coins' processing.\n\nThe loop for j from coin to maxn-1.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo j = coin, maxn-1\n\n   if (dp(j - coin) +1 > dp(j) ) then\n\n      dp(j) = dp(j - coin) +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, compiling and testing this code should work.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as written above."
