So if the current mask's processing doesn't meet the condition, the value remains as it was (initially 0, then previous value). So the loop may not terminate if no valid mask is found, but the problem ensures that eventually a valid mask will be found. The code's logic is to find the first value (smallest possible) that meets the condition and is >= number. Because mask starts at 2 and increments, the first valid value that is >= number is the answer. Thus, in Fortran, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize ans = -1 (but in Fortran, maybe as a large number), and the minimal value found. Initialize mask = 2.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC119_B) reads N lines of input where each line has a number and a unit (either \"JPY\" or something else). It calculates the sum of all the numbers, converting non-JPY units by multiplying by 380000. The output is the total sum.\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string input, then outputs the first character of that string plus 1. Wait, but in Java, characters are treated as their ASCII values. So if the input is, say, \"a\", it would output 'b'? But looking at the code, it's taking the first character of the input string, adding 1 to its ASCII value, and printing that as a character. However, the code here is part of a class, but the main method only reads one line and processes the first character. The other code in the class (RemRing) isn't used here, so maybe that's part of another problem but included here by mistake? Since the user provided all three files, I have to assume that the second program's main is the one to consider. Wait, the second file's main is in atcoder_ABC151_A, which reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1, and prints it. So the output of the first program is the input to the second, but the second only takes a single string input. Wait, but the first program's output is a number. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. The user says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the first character of which is processed). So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then converted to a string, and that's the input to the second program. The second program takes that string, takes its first character, adds 1, and outputs that character. Then the third program takes that character as input?\n\nWait, but the third program (codeforces_96_B) reads a long number. So the output of the second program is a single character, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a number. That can't be right. There's a disconnect here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the sequence. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nLooking at the first program's output: it's a double, printed with System.out.println(solve(...)), so that's a number. The second program's input is read via BufferedReader, which reads a line. So the first program's output is a number, which is the input line for the second program. The second program takes that line (the number as a string), takes the first character (the first digit?), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character. For example, if the first program outputs 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\", so the first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so output is '2'. Then the third program takes that '2' as input, but the third program expects a long number. So the third program would read \"2\" as a long, which is okay. Then it processes that number (2) and outputs the result.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is looking for a number, and it's in a loop until value >= number. Let me see: the third program's code is looking for the smallest number made of 4s and 7s (with equal number of 0s and 1s in binary?), but perhaps I need to focus on the sequence.\n\nThe problem is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The key is that the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. So in Fortran, I need to read the input for the first program, process all three steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the list of x and u (from first Java program).\n2. Compute the sum as per first program.\n3. Take that sum, convert it to a string, take its first character, add 1 (ASCII), get a character.\n4. Take that character as a number (the third program expects a long, so perhaps the character is converted to its numeric value, but the third program's input is a number. Wait, the third program's main reads a long via nextLong(). So the second program's output is a single character (like '2'), which when passed as input to the third program would be read as the number 2. So the third program's input is that character's ASCII code? Or the actual numeric value? Wait, no. The second program's output is a character, which when printed is just that character. So if the second program outputs '2', then the third program reads that as a string, which is \"2\", so nextLong() would read 2 as a long. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran need to be:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (N, then N lines of x and u).\n- Compute the sum (first program's solve function).\n- Take that sum, convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value (second program's processing).\n- Then, take that resulting character's ASCII value (or the character as a string?), but the third program expects a number. Wait, the third program's input is a long number. So the second program's output is a single character, which when passed to the third program is read as a string, which is parsed as a long. So the third program's input is the character's ASCII code? No, the character is printed as a character, so the input to the third program is the character's ASCII code? Wait, no. Let's think: the second program's output is, for example, the character '2', which is written to stdout. The third program reads that as a line, which is the string \"2\", so nextLong() parses that as 2. So the third program's input is the numeric value of the character's first digit? Or the actual numeric value of the character's ASCII code? Wait, no. The second program's output is a single character, which is written as a string. So if the first program's output is 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\", so the first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so the output is '2', which is written as a single character. The third program reads that as a line, which is \"2\", so it parses that as the number 2. So the third program's input is 2. So the third program's code is looking for the smallest number made of 4 and 7 digits with equal number of 0s and 1s in their binary representations? Wait, the third program's code is a bit more involved. Let me look at it again.\n\nThird program's code:\n\nIt reads a number (number = in.nextLong()), then initializes ans and value. The loop continues while value < number. The mask starts at 2, and increments. The code converts mask to binary, takes substring(1) (so removes the first character?), then counts the number of zeros. If the number of zeros is not equal to the number of ones (since zeros != (length - zeros)), then skip. Then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and set value. The loop continues until value is >= number, then outputs the value.\n\nWait, the mask starts at 2, and increments. The binary string is obtained by converting mask to binary, then taking substring(1), which removes the first character. For example, mask=2 is 10 in binary. substring(1) would be \"0\". Then zeros count is 1, length is 1, so zeros (1) must equal (length - zeros) (0), which is not, so it skips. Hmm, maybe I need to understand the code better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to generate numbers composed of 4 and 7 digits, with the count of 4s and 7s equal. The mask is used to generate binary strings where the number of 0s and 1s are equal. The mask is converted to binary, then the first character is stripped (so maybe to avoid leading 1?), then the remaining bits are considered. The zeros count must equal the number of 1s (since zeros = (length - zeros) \u2192 2*zeros = length). So the binary string (after substring(1)) must have equal 0s and 1s. Then, replacing 0 with 4 and 1 with 7 gives a number made of 4 and 7 with equal counts. The code finds the smallest such number that is >= the input number.\n\nSo the third program's input is a number (the output of the second program, which is a single digit character's ASCII value? Or the numeric value of the character's first digit?), but in the sequence, the second program's output is a single character, which is the first character of the first program's output (as a string) plus 1. So the third program's input is that character's ASCII code? Or the numeric value of the character? For example, if the first program outputs 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\", so first character is '1' (ASCII 49), adding 1 gives 50 (ASCII '2'), so the third program's input is '2', which is read as 2. So the third program's input is 2, and it would process that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N and the N lines of x and u (from first program's input).\n2. Compute the sum as per first program (summing each x[i] multiplied by 380000 if unit is not JPY, else 1).\n3. Convert the sum to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value (so in Fortran, we can get the ASCII code with ichar, add 1, then get the character again).\n4. Take that resulting character's ASCII value (or the character itself?), but the third program's input is the numeric value of that character? Wait, no. The third program expects a number. The second program's output is a single character, which when passed to the third program is read as a string, which is parsed as a long. So the third program's input is the numeric value of the character's first digit? Or the actual ASCII code? Wait, no. Let's think of an example:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 1234.5. Then the second program's input is \"1234.5\" (assuming the first program's output is printed with a decimal). The first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so the second program outputs '2'. The third program reads that as the input, which is the string \"2\", so it parses as 2. So the third program's input is 2. So the third program's input is the numeric value of the first character of the first program's output (as a string) plus 1, but as a number. So in Fortran, after step 2, we have the sum. We need to convert that sum to a string, take the first character, get its ASCII code, add 1, then convert back to a character. Then, that character is the input to the third program. But in Fortran, since we can't have intermediate I/O, we have to process all steps in memory.\n\nWait, the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a single character. So in Fortran, after step 2, we have the sum. We need to process it as per the second program's logic, then pass that result to the third program's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read N, then N pairs of x and u (strings).\n- Compute the total sum (sum over x_i * (1 if u_i is 'JPY', else 380000)).\n- Convert the sum to a string. Take the first character of that string. Let's call this char1.\n- Compute new_char = char(ichar(char1) + 1)\n- Now, the third program's input is the numeric value of new_char. Wait, no. The third program's input is the numeric value represented by the string that is the output of the second program. Since the second program outputs new_char (a single character), the third program's input is the numeric value of that character's ASCII code? Or the numeric value of the character as a digit?\n\nWait, the third program's input is whatever the second program outputs. The second program outputs a single character (like '2'), so when passed to the third program, the third program reads that as a string, which is \"2\", so nextLong() parses it as 2. So the third program's input is the numeric value of the character's first digit (if it's a digit). So in Fortran, after step 2, we have the sum. We need to:\n\n- Convert the sum to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program). The first Java program uses System.out.println(solve(...)), which for a double would print it with a decimal point, but perhaps in the problem's context, it's an integer? Or maybe the problem expects the exact output formatting. Wait, the first Java program's solve function returns a double, so the output is printed as a double. So the string representation could have a decimal point. For example, if the sum is 1234.0, it would print \"1234.0\", so the first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so the second program's output is '2', leading to third program's input being 2. But if the sum is 1234.5, then the first character is '1', same result. If the sum is 0.0, then the first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1', so third program's input is 1. But if the sum is something like \"NaN\" or \"Infinity\", but probably the problem ensures valid inputs.\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate the first program's output as a string, we need to format the sum as a double. The default in Java's print would be to print with a decimal point, but perhaps in Fortran, we can use a format that matches. For example, using a format like F12.1 or similar, but maybe just converting to a string with WRITE(*,*) would suffice, but we need to capture the string representation exactly as the first program would output it. However, in Fortran, the exact string formatting might differ slightly, but perhaps for the problem's purposes, it's acceptable to just convert the sum to a string, then take the first character.\n\nOnce we have the new_char (the result of the second program's processing), we need to process it through the third program's logic. The third program's input is the numeric value of the new_char's ASCII code? No, the third program's input is the numeric value represented by the new_char as a string. For example, if new_char is '2', then the third program's input is 2. So in Fortran, the third step's input is the numeric value of the new_char's first character (as a digit). Wait, but what if the first character is not a digit? Like if the sum was \"NaN\", then the first character is 'N', adding 1 gives 'O', which is not a digit. But the problem probably ensures that the first program's output is a number, so the first character is a digit or '-' or '.'?\n\nHmm, but the third program expects a long, so if the second program's output is a non-digit character, then the third program would throw an error. But the problem's input is such that the first program's output is a valid number, so the second program's output is a valid digit? Not necessarily. For example, if the first program's output is 1234.5, then the first character is '1', so the second program outputs '2', which is a digit. If the first program's output is 0.0, then first character is '0', so second program outputs '1'. If the first program's output is -123, then the first character is '-', so adding 1 gives a character with ASCII code 45+1=46, which is '.' (since '-' is 45). Then the third program would read '.' as input, which is not a number, leading to an error. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the first program's output is a non-negative number, so the first character is a digit or '.'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is an integer, so the string would not have a decimal point. For example, if the sum is an integer, then the first Java program would print it as an integer (without decimal). So the first character is a digit. So assuming that the first program's output is an integer, then the second program's output is a digit, so the third program can process it.\n\nAssuming that, in Fortran, after getting the new_char (the character from step 2), we can convert it to a number (digit) by subtracting '0' (ichar('0')), so the third program's input is the numeric value of that character.\n\nNow, the third program's logic:\n\nThe third program reads a number (let's call it input_num), then finds the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 digits, with equal number of 4s and 7s, such that the number is >= input_num. The way it does this is by iterating mask starting from 2, converting mask to binary, taking substring(1) (so removing the first character?), then checking if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, then parse as a long. The first such value >= input_num is the answer.\n\nWait, let me re-express the third program's code in pseudocode:\n\nnumber = input (from second program's output)\nans = -1\nvalue = 0\nmask = 2\nloop while value < number:\n    s = binary of mask, without first character (substring(1))\n    count zeros in s\n    if zeros != (length of s - zeros) \u2192 continue\n    replace 0 with 4, 1 with 7 \u2192 new string\n    value = parse to long\n    if value >= number \u2192 set ans to value and break?\nWait, the code's loop is while value < number, but the code inside the loop is:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time. For each mask:\n\nbinary_str = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1)\n\nso for mask=2 \u2192 binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\"\n\nthen count zeros in \"0\" \u2192 1. The length is 1, so zeros (1) must equal (length - zeros) \u2192 0 \u2192 no, so skip.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary \"11\", substring(1) is \"1\" \u2192 zeros=0, length 1 \u2192 0 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary \"100\" \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\" \u2192 zeros=2, length 2 \u2192 2 == 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen replace 0 with 4 \u2192 \"44\", so value is 44. So if the input number is 44, then this would be the value.\n\nSo the code is generating numbers made of 4 and 7 digits with equal counts of 4 and 7. The mask is used to generate binary strings (after substring(1)) with equal 0s and 1s. The mask starts at 2, so the first valid is mask=4 (binary 100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\" \u2192 two zeros, so 0s count is 2, length 2 \u2192 equal. So the generated number is 44.\n\nThe loop continues until the generated value is >= the input number. The first such value is the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N, then N lines each with a double and a string (u_i).\n\n2. Compute the sum as per first program.\n\n3. Convert the sum to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, get new_char.\n\n4. Convert new_char to a number (digit) \u2192 input_num = ichar(new_char) - ichar('0') (assuming it's a digit).\n\n5. Then process input_num through the third program's logic to find the minimal 4/7 number >= input_num.\n\nFinally, output the result of step 5.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (sum):\n\nRead N, then N lines of x and u.\n\nIn Fortran, reading strings can be done with read(*,*) but for variable length strings, perhaps using a character array. Since Fortran 90/95, we can use character(len=*) variables, but for fixed length, maybe we can use a fixed length like 10 or so.\n\nWait, the u array can be either \"JPY\" or other strings. So each u_i is a string. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read each line as two variables: a double and a string.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nRead N.\n\nThen loop N times, reading x_i and u_i.\n\nCompute the sum: for each i, if u_i is \"JPY\", multiply x_i by 1, else by 380000.0d0.\n\nSum all those.\n\nThen, convert the sum to a string. To do this, we can write the sum to a string variable. In Fortran, using write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(g0)') total_sum\n\nBut need to ensure that the format matches the Java's output. Java's print of a double may have a decimal point even if it's an integer. For example, 123 would be printed as \"123.0\" or \"123\"? Wait, in Java, the code uses System.out.println(solve(...)), and solve returns a double. So if the sum is an integer, it would print as, say, 123.0. But if it's an integer, maybe the code would print it as 123.0, but perhaps in the problem's context, the sum is an integer, so the first character is a digit. Alternatively, maybe the problem ensures that the sum is an integer, so the string would be like \"1234\" without decimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input ensures that all u_i are \"JPY\" or other units, but the sum is an integer. But regardless, in Fortran, we can just write the sum as a string with a format that includes the decimal point, but the first character is the first digit or '-'.\n\nOnce we have the string, take the first character (sum_str(1:1)), then compute new_char = char(ichar(sum_str(1:1)) + 1).\n\nThen, the input_num is the numeric value of new_char, assuming it's a digit. So input_num = ichar(new_char) - ichar('0').\n\nWait, but if new_char is not a digit (like '.'), then this would be an error. But assuming the problem's input ensures that the first character is a digit, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the third part's logic.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 digits with equal counts, >= input_num.\n\nThe algorithm in the third Java program uses a mask starting at 2, converting to binary, taking substring(1), then checking zeros count.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop mask from 2 upwards, for each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string.\n\n- Take substring starting from the second character (since substring(1) in Java is from index 1, which is the second character in Fortran's 1-based indexing? Wait, in Java, substring(1) gives from index 1 (second character). So in Fortran, if the binary string is stored in a variable, say bin_str, then the substring would be bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str)).\n\nWait, let's think of mask=4 (binary \"100\"). The substring(1) in Java would be \"00\", so in Fortran, the binary string is \"100\", so bin_str(2:) is \"00\".\n\nThen, count the number of '0's in that substring. The length is 2, so zeros must be 1? Wait, no, in the example mask=4, the substring is \"00\", so zeros count is 2, length is 2 \u2192 2 == 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the condition is that the number of zeros equals the number of ones (since zeros = (length - zeros) \u2192 2*zeros = length).\n\nSo for each mask:\n\n1. Convert mask to binary string (without leading zeros?).\n\nWait, in Java, Integer.toBinaryString(4) is \"100\", so leading zeros are not present. So in Fortran, we need to generate the binary string of mask without leading zeros.\n\nTo convert an integer to binary in Fortran, perhaps using a loop to build the string.\n\nFunction to convert integer to binary string (without leading zeros):\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  CHARACTER(LEN=32) :: bin_str\n  INTEGER :: i, pos\n  bin_str = ''\n  IF (n == 0) THEN\n    bin_str = '0'\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  pos = 0\n  DO WHILE (n > 0)\n    pos = pos + 1\n    bin_str(pos:pos) = ACHAR(ICHAR('0') + MOD(n,2))\n    n = n / 2\n  END DO\n  ! Reverse the string\n  bin_str = reverse(bin_str(1:pos))\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, but reversing is needed because the bits are generated from least significant to most. Alternatively, build the string in reverse and then reverse it.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  CHARACTER(LEN=32) :: bin_str\n  INTEGER :: i, len\n  bin_str = ''\n  IF (n == 0) THEN\n    bin_str = '0'\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  len = 0\n  DO\n    bin_str(len+1:len+1) = ACHAR(ICHAR('0') + MOD(n,2))\n    n = n / 2\n    len = len + 1\n    IF (n == 0) EXIT\n  END DO\n  ! Reverse the string\n  bin_str = reverse(bin_str(1:len))\nEND FUNCTION\n\nBut reversing the string can be done with a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a loop to build the string in reverse and then reverse it.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use bit_size and bit functions, but for integers up to some limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a loop to build the binary string.\n\nOnce the binary string is obtained, we take the substring starting from the second character (since in Java it's substring(1)), so in Fortran, bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str)).\n\nThen, count the number of '0's in that substring.\n\nIf the count of '0's is equal to the length of the substring divided by 2 (since 2*zeros = length), then proceed.\n\nThen, replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's, forming a new string, then convert to a number.\n\nThe minimal such number that is >= input_num is the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nWe can loop mask from 2 upwards, for each mask:\n\n- Convert to binary string (without leading zeros).\n\n- Take substring starting at 2nd character.\n\n- Check if the number of '0's equals the length of the substring divided by 2 (must be even length).\n\n- If yes:\n\n   - Create the new string by replacing '0' with '4' and '1' with '7'.\n\n   - Convert this string to a number (value).\n\n   - If value >= input_num, then check if it's the smallest so far.\n\nWait, but the code in Java uses a loop with mask starting at 2, and increments mask each time. The first value that meets the condition and is >= input_num is the answer. Because the loop continues until value >= input_num, but the code in Java's third program's loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... compute value for current mask ...\n\n}\n\nWait, the code inside the loop is:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time. For each mask, compute s, then if the condition is met, compute value. But the loop continues until value < number. Wait, the code is:\n\nvalue is initialized to 0. The loop runs while value < number. Inside the loop, mask is incremented, and the code tries to compute a new value. But if the current mask's processing gives a value that is >= number, then the loop will exit, but the code may not have stored it yet. Wait, the code in Java:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   mask++;\n\n   ... compute s, check zeros, etc.\n\n   if (condition met) {\n\n      s = ... replaced string\n\n      value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nThe loop is while (value < number):\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask is incremented (mask starts at 2, then mask++ is done first? Wait, the code is:\n\nmask starts at 2, then in the loop:\n\nmask is incremented first (mask++), then the processing.\n\nWait, the code in the third program's main:\n\nmask = 2\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n    ... \n\n    if (condition) {\n\n        s = ... \n\n        value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the mask is incremented after the current use. So the first iteration:\n\nmask is 2, then mask becomes 3 after the first iteration.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\ns = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1) \u2192 mask is 2 \u2192 binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nThen mask is incremented (mask becomes 3).\n\nSo the loop is processing mask=2 first, then mask increments to 3.\n\nThe loop continues until value (the current value from the last valid mask) is >= number.\n\nWait, but the value is only updated when the condition is met. So if the current mask's processing doesn't meet the condition, the value remains as it was (initially 0, then previous value). So the loop may not terminate if no valid mask is found, but the problem ensures that eventually a valid mask will be found.\n\nThe code's logic is to find the first value (smallest possible) that meets the condition and is >= number. Because mask starts at 2 and increments, the first valid value that is >= number is the answer.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize ans = -1 (but in Fortran, maybe as a large number), and the minimal value found.\n\nInitialize mask = 2.\n\nLoop:\n\n   compute bin_str for mask.\n\n   process as per above.\n\n   if condition met:\n\n      create the new string (replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927).\n\n      convert to value.\n\n      if value >= input_num and (ans is -1 or value < ans):\n\n          ans = value\n\n   increment mask.\n\n   continue until we find the first value >= input_num?\n\nWait, no, the Java code's loop is while (value < number). The value is only updated when the condition is met. So the loop continues until the current value (from the last valid mask) is >= number. But the first time a valid value is found that is >= number, the loop will exit, and that value is the answer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, value is 0.\n\nSuppose input_num is 2.\n\nThe first valid mask is 4 (mask=4):\n\nbinary is \"100\", substring(1) is \"00\".\n\nzeros count is 2, length 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nso s becomes \"44\", value is 44.\n\nSince 44 >= 2 \u2192 the loop condition (value < number \u2192 44 < 2?) No, so the loop exits. The value is 44, which is the answer.\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So if value is 44 and number is 2, then 44 < 2 is false, so the loop exits. So the answer is 44.\n\nBut the code's loop is inside the while loop, so the code would have found the value, and then the loop exits. So the answer is the first value that is >= number.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is structured as:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   mask++;\n\n   ... compute s, etc.\n\n   if (condition) {\n\n      s = ... \n\n      value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask is first used (mask is current value), then mask is incremented.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nmask = 2\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1);\n\n    ... \n\n    if (condition) {\n\n        s = ... \n\n        value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n    }\n\n    mask++;\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask is used, then mask is incremented.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nmask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1);\n\n    ... \n\n    if (condition) {\n\n        s = ... \n\n        value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n    }\n\n    mask++;\n\n}\n\nSo the mask is first used, then incremented. So the first iteration uses mask=2, then mask becomes 3.\n\nThe loop continues as long as value < number. So once a value is found that is >= number, the loop stops, and the value is the answer.\n\nThus, the first value that is >= number is the answer.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can loop mask from 2 upwards, and for each mask:\n\n- compute the binary string.\n\n- process as per the condition.\n\n- if condition met, compute the value.\n\n- if value >= input_num, then return it immediately (since we are looping in order, the first such value is the smallest possible).\n\nWait, but the mask increases, so the first valid value that meets the condition and is >= input_num is the minimal possible.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can loop mask from 2 upwards, and for each mask:\n\n   compute the binary string.\n\n   process substring(2:).\n\n   count zeros.\n\n   if zeros *2 == length of substring:\n\n      create the new string (replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927).\n\n      convert to value.\n\n      if value >= input_num \u2192 return this value as the answer.\n\nThus, once we find the first such value, we can break and return it.\n\nThis is more efficient.\n\nSo the algorithm in Fortran can be:\n\nDO mask = 2, huge_value\n\n   bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   substr = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str))\n\n   zeros = count( substr == '0' )\n\n   len_sub = len_trim(substr)\n\n   if (2*zeros /= len_sub) cycle\n\n   ! create the new string\n\n   new_str = replace_0_1_with_4_7(substr)\n\n   read(new_str, *) value\n\n   if (value >= input_num) then\n\n      ans = value\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nEND DO\n\nThus, the first such value is the answer.\n\nNow, implementing the functions.\n\nFirst, the int_to_bin function.\n\nLet me write a function to convert an integer to a binary string without leading zeros.\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  CHARACTER(LEN=32) :: bin_str\n  INTEGER :: i, pos\n  bin_str = ''\n  IF (n == 0) THEN\n    bin_str = '0'\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  pos = 0\n  DO\n    pos = pos + 1\n    bin_str(pos:pos) = ACHAR(ICHAR('0') + MOD(n,2))\n    n = n / 2\n    IF (n == 0) EXIT\n  END DO\n  ! Reverse the string\n  bin_str = bin_str(1:pos)\n  bin_str = bin_str(pos: -1:1)  ! Reverse\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, the loop builds the string in reverse order. For example, n=4 (100):\n\nn=4 \u2192 mod(4,2)=0 \u2192 first character '0'\n\nn becomes 2 \u2192 mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 next '0'\n\nn becomes 1 \u2192 mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 next '1'\n\nn becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nThe string is '001', then reversed to '100'.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nThen, the substring is from position 2 to end (since in Fortran, the first character is the first character of the binary string).\n\nThen, count the number of '0's in the substring.\n\nThen, create the new string by replacing '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\nA helper function to replace characters:\n\nFUNCTION replace_0_1(s) RESULT(new_s)\n  CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN) :: s\n  CHARACTER(LEN=LEN(s)) :: new_s\n  INTEGER :: i\n  DO i = 1, LEN(s)\n    IF (s(i:i) == '0') THEN\n      new_s(i:i) = '4'\n    ELSE IF (s(i:i) == '1') THEN\n      new_s(i:i) = '7'\n    END IF\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION\n\nThus, putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all parts into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read N, then N lines of x and u.\n\n2. Compute the sum.\n\n3. Convert sum to string, get first character, add 1.\n\n4. Convert to input_num.\n\n5. Process input_num through the third program's logic.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nNow, handling the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead N, then N lines each with a double and a string.\n\nIn Fortran, reading variable-length strings can be done with a character array of sufficient length. Let's assume that the unit strings are either \"JPY\" or other strings, but we only need to check if it's \"JPY\".\n\nWe can read each line as:\n\nDO i = 1, N\n\n   READ(*,*) x(i), u(i)\n\nEND DO\n\nBut in Fortran, the u array needs to be a character array. Let's define:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_u_length = 4 ! since \"JPY\" is 3, maybe 4 is enough.\n\ncharacter(len=max_u_length) :: u(N)\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading with *, the strings are read until the next whitespace. So if the unit is \"USD\", it will be read correctly.\n\nThen, compute the sum:\n\ntotal_sum = 0.0d0\n\nDO i = 1, N\n\n   IF (u(i) == 'JPY') THEN\n\n      total_sum = total_sum + x(i)\n\n   ELSE\n\n      total_sum = total_sum + x(i) * 380000.0d0\n\n   END IF\n\nEND DO\n\nThen, convert total_sum to a string.\n\nWe can use a write statement into a character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(g0)') total_sum\n\nBut need to ensure that the string is properly formatted. The 'g0' format uses the shortest format between e and f, but maybe using a fixed format like F20.0 would be better if the sum is an integer. Alternatively, using '(ES20.10)' but that might add exponents. Alternatively, perhaps using '(G0)' is okay.\n\nOnce we have sum_str, take the first character:\n\nchar1 = sum_str(1:1)\n\nnew_char = char(ichar(char1) + 1)\n\nThen, input_num is the numeric value of new_char, assuming it's a digit:\n\ninput_num = ichar(new_char) - ichar('0')\n\nNow, process input_num through the third program's logic.\n\nImplement the loop for mask from 2 upwards.\n\nInitialize ans = -1 (but in Fortran, maybe a large number).\n\nBut since we can exit early, we can loop until we find the first valid value.\n\nNow, the code for the third part:\n\ninteger :: input_num, mask, zeros, len_sub, ans\n\ncharacter(len=32) :: bin_str, substr, new_str\n\nans = -1\n\nmask = 2\n\nDO\n\n   bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   substr = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str))\n\n   len_sub = len_trim(substr)\n\n   zeros = 0\n\n   DO i = 1, len_sub\n\n      IF (substr(i:i) == '0') zeros = zeros + 1\n\n   END DO\n\n   IF (2*zeros /= len_sub) THEN\n\n      mask = mask + 1\n\n      CYCLE\n\n   END IF\n\n   new_str = replace_0_1(substr)\n\n   ! Convert new_str to a number\n\n   read(new_str, *, iostat=ios) value\n\n   IF (ios /= 0) THEN\n\n      mask = mask + 1\n\n      CYCLE\n\n   END IF\n\n   IF (value >= input_num) THEN\n\n      ans = value\n\n      EXIT\n\n   END IF\n\n   mask = mask + 1\n\nEND DO\n\nBut need to handle the loop properly. Alternatively, use a DO loop with mask from 2 to some upper limit.\n\nBut in Fortran, an infinite loop with exit is okay.\n\nWait, but the loop must eventually find a value. So the code can be:\n\nDO\n\n   bin_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   substr = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str))\n\n   len_sub = len_trim(substr)\n\n   zeros = count( substr == '0' )\n\n   if (2*zeros /= len_sub) then\n\n      mask = mask + 1\n\n      cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   new_str = replace_0_1(substr)\n\n   read(new_str, *, iostat=ios) value\n\n   if (ios /= 0) then\n\n      mask = mask + 1\n\n      cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   if (value >= input_num) then\n\n      ans = value\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask + 1\n\nend do\n\nBut need to declare variables:\n\ninteger :: mask, zeros, len_sub, value, ios\n\ncharacter(len=32) :: bin_str, substr, new_str\n\nmask = 2\n\nans = -1\n\nloop:\n\nDO\n\n   ... \n\n   if (value >= input_num) then\n\n      ans = value\n\n      exit loop\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask + 1\n\nEND DO loop\n\nWait, but the code may have to read the new_str into value. The read statement may have an error if the string is empty, but the condition ensures that substr is non-empty (since mask starts at 2, bin_str is at least \"10\", so substr is at least \"0\").\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nFinally, output ans.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nBut also need to include the functions int_to_bin and replace_0_1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be inside the program or in modules. For simplicity, we can write them as internal functions.\n\nAlternatively, write them as functions inside the program.\n\nHere's the full code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer, parameter :: max_u_length = 4\n\n  integer :: N, i, input_num, mask, zeros, len_sub, ans, ios\n\n  double precision :: total_sum, x(1000) ! assuming N is up to 1000\n\n  character(len=20) :: sum_str, char1, new_char\n\n  character(len=max_u_length) :: u(1000)\n\n  !

Assuming the write statement produces \"1234.0\", then the first character is '1', new_char is '2', input_num is 2.\n\nThen, the third program's input is 2. The loop starts with mask=2:\n\nmask=2 \u2192 binary is \"10\" \u2192 substr is \"0\" (length 1). zeros=1 \u2192 2*1 = 2 != 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary \"11\" \u2192 substr \"1\" \u2192 zeros=0 \u2192 0*2=0 !=1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary \"100\" \u2192 substr \"00\" \u2192 zeros=2 \u2192 2*2=4? No, length is 2 \u2192 2*2=4? Wait, length is 2, zeros=2 \u2192 2*2 =4? No, 2*zeros = 2*2=4, but length is 2 \u2192 4 !=2 \u2192 no. Wait, no:\n\nWait, mask=4 \u2192 binary is \"100\", substr is \"00\" (length 2). zeros=2 \u2192 2*2 =4? No, 2*zeros = 2*2=4, but length is 2 \u2192 4 !=2 \u2192 condition not met. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the condition is 2*zeros == length_sub.\n\nFor mask=4:\n\nsubstr is \"00\" \u2192 zeros=2, length=2 \u2192 2*2 =4 !=2 \u2192 condition not met. So this is not valid.\n\nWait, but in the Java code example earlier, mask=4 was valid. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, in the Java code, the mask=4's binary is \"100\", substring(1) is \"00\" \u2192 length 2, zeros=2 \u2192 2 == 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, 2*zeros = 2*2 =4, but length is 2 \u2192 4 !=2 \u2192 no. Wait, this is a mistake.\n\nWait, the condition in the Java code is zeros != (length - zeros). So zeros must equal (length - zeros) \u2192 2*zeros = length.\n\nAh, right. So for mask=4's case:\n\nzeros = 2, length=2 \u2192 2*2 =4 \u2192 no, but 2*zeros = length \u2192 2*2 =4, but length is 2 \u2192 no. Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the Java code's condition is:\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\nSo zeros must equal (length - zeros) \u2192 2*zeros = length.\n\nIn mask=4's case, zeros=2, length=2 \u2192 2*2 =4 !=2 \u2192 so the condition is not met \u2192 the code would skip.\n\nBut earlier analysis said that mask=4 would be valid. That was a mistake.\n\nWait, what's the correct condition?\n\nThe code in the third program:\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\nSo, if zeros != (length - zeros), then skip.\n\nThus, the condition to proceed is when zeros == (length - zeros).\n\nWhich means 2*zeros = length.\n\nSo for mask=4's case:\n\nlength is 2, zeros=2 \u2192 2*2 =4 !=2 \u2192 so condition not met \u2192 skipped.\n\nSo mask=4 is not valid.\n\nHmm, so where is the first valid mask?\n\nLet's see:\n\nmask=5 \u2192 binary \"101\" \u2192 substring(1) is \"01\" \u2192 zeros=1, length=2 \u2192 2*1=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the substring is \"01\" \u2192 zeros=1, length=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen, replacing 0\u21924, 1\u21927 \u2192 \"47\" \u2192 value=47.\n\nIf input_num is 2, then 47 is the first valid value >=2 \u2192 so the answer is 47.\n\nWait, but mask=5:\n\nmask=5 \u2192 binary is \"101\", substring(1) is \"01\".\n\nzeros count is 1 \u2192 2*1 =2 (length is 2) \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the value is 47.\n\nSo the code would return 47.\n\nBut in the earlier example where mask=4 was considered, it was incorrect.\n\nThus, the code must be correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother example:\n\nIf the first program's output is 44 \u2192 sum_str is \"44.0\" \u2192 first character '4', new_char is '5', input_num=5.\n\nThe third program's input is 5.\n\nLooking for the first value >=5.\n\nmask=5 gives 47 \u2192 which is >=5 \u2192 so the answer is 47.\n\nAnother example:\n\nIf the first program's output is 47 \u2192 input_num is '5' (from '4' +1 \u2192 '5') \u2192 input_num=5 \u2192 the answer is 47.\n\nWait, no, the first program's output is 47 \u2192 sum_str is \"47.0\" \u2192 first character '4', new_char is '5', input_num=5 \u2192 the third program's input is 5. The first valid value is 47 (mask=5) \u2192 which is >=5 \u2192 so answer is 47.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the functions are defined inside the program via the contains clause.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The int_to_bin function may have issues with the length of the string. The bin_str is 32 characters, but the actual length is pos.\n\n- The replace_0_1 function correctly replaces 0 and 1.\n\n- The loop for mask may take a long time for large input_num, but the problem likely expects it to be manageable.\n\n- The read statement for new_str may have issues if the string is empty, but the condition ensures that substr is non-empty.\n\n- The initial value of mask starts at 2.\n\n- The input_num is computed correctly.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program should be as outlined above."
