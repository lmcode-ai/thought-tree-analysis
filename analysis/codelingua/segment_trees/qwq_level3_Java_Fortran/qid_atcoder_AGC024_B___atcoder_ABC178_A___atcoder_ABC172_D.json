    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first Java file, atcoder_AGC024_B. It reads N and an array P, then processes it to find some 'nglist' of indices where the permutation has a decrease. Then it calculates an answer based on the positions of these decreases. The output here is the minimum value computed from those positions.\n\nThe second Java file, atcoder_ABC178_A, takes an integer x, checks if it's 1, and outputs 0 or 1 accordingly. Wait, actually, the code there is a bit redundant. The logic is: if x is 1, then bool is true, so result is 0 (since !bool would be false, so 0). If x isn't 1, then result is 1. So the output is 1 when x is not 1, else 0. So the second program's output is simply 1 - x. Because if x is 1, output 0, else 1. So the second program's output is 1 - x. Wait, let me check again. The code says:\n\nbool = x ==1 ? true : false; so bool is (x==1). Then result is !bool ? 1 : 0. So if x is 1, then !bool is false, so result is 0. If x is not 1, then !bool is true, so result is 1. So yes, the output is 1 - x? Wait no, because x can be any integer. Wait, for x=0, output is 1. For x=2, output is 1. Only when x is 1, output is 0. So the output is 1 - (x ==1 ? 1 : 0). So the output is 1 - (x ==1). So the second program's output is 1 minus the boolean (x==1). So the output is 1 when x is not 1, else 0. So the second program's output is 1 - (x ==1). \n\nThe third program, atcoder_ABC172_D, takes an integer n and computes some sum. The formula is a bit complex. Let me see: the loop runs from i=1 to n. For each i, it adds i multiplied by (n//i) multiplied by (n//i +1)/2. Wait, the formula is (n//i) is integer division. So the term for each i is i * (k)*(k+1)/2 where k = n//i. The sum of all these terms from i=1 to n.\n\nNow, the sequence is: the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is input to the third. Wait, no, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a single integer (the ans variable). The second program takes an integer x (from first's output) and outputs 0 or 1. Then the third program takes that 0 or 1 as its input n, and computes the sum. Wait, but the third program's input is n, which is read via sc.nextInt(). So the second program's output is the input to the third. So the third program's n is the output of the second program. \n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first's output \u2192 second's input \u2192 second's output \u2192 third's input \u2192 third's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and then output the final result of the third step.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N and P array from input (first program's input).\n2. Process the first program's logic to compute ans1 (the first program's output).\n3. Take ans1 as x, compute ans2 = 1 - (x ==1). (Second program's output)\n4. Take ans2 as n, compute the third program's sum and output that.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read N and the array P (as integers, but in Java they are 0-based, so in Fortran, which uses 1-based indices, need to adjust? Wait, in Java, the code does P[i] = scan.nextInt() -1, so the input numbers are 1-based (since they subtract 1 to make 0-based). So in Fortran, the input numbers are 1-based, but stored as 0-based in P. Wait, in the first Java program, the input is read as scan.nextInt() and then subtract 1, so the actual P array is 0-based. So in Fortran, when reading the input, each element is read as is, then subtract 1 to get the 0-based index. But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so perhaps we can adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a different lower bound. So perhaps we can use 0-based arrays by declaring them with a lower bound of 0. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst program's processing:\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\n- Read N, then N integers, which are stored in P as 0-based (since each is scan.nextInt() -1).\n\nSo in Fortran, the input for the first program is N followed by N integers. The P array in Fortran will be 1-based, but the values are the same as in Java (since the Java code subtracts 1 from each input). Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Java, the code does:\n\nP[i] = scan.nextInt() -1;\n\nSo for each input number, it subtracts 1 to make it 0-based. So the input numbers are 1-based (like 1 to N), and stored as 0-based in P.\n\nIn Fortran, to replicate this, when reading the array, each element is read as is, then subtract 1. So the array in Fortran will be 1-based, but the elements are 0-based (since each input is subtracted by 1).\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead N, then read N integers into an array P(1:N), then subtract 1 from each element.\n\nNext, the first program's processing:\n\nThe first program creates a map (Java's HashMap) that maps each value in P to its index. In Fortran, since arrays are ordered, perhaps we can create an array pos(0:N-1) where pos(p) = i (since in Java, map.put(P[i], i). So for each element in P, which is 0-based in Java (since P[i] is 0-based), the key is P[i], and the value is the index i (0-based in Java). \n\nIn Fortran, since the array P is 1-based (indices 1 to N), but the elements are 0-based (since we subtracted 1), the pos array can be of size N (since the maximum P element is N-1, 0-based). So pos(0) would be the index (1-based in Fortran) where P(1) is 0, etc. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for each i from 0 to N-1, the key is P[i], and the value is i. So in Fortran, for each j from 1 to N (Fortran's index), the key is P(j) (which is 0-based), and the value is j-1 (since in Java, the index is 0-based). Wait, no. Wait in Java, the index i is 0-based. So in Fortran, the index is j (1-based), so the Java equivalent index is j-1. So the pos array in Fortran would be pos(P(j)) = j-1. So to create pos array:\n\nWe can have an array pos(0:N-1). Initialize it to some default (maybe -1?), then loop through each j from 1 to N, and set pos(P(j)) = j-1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0 by default if not set. Wait, no, in Fortran, local variables are not initialized, but arrays declared with a size may have undefined values. So perhaps we need to initialize pos to -1 first, then loop through each element.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: pos\npos = -1  ! Initialize all to -1\ndo j = 1, N\n   pos(P(j)) = j-1\nend do\n\nThis way, pos(k) gives the index (0-based in Java) where the value k is located. \n\nNext, the nglist is a list of indices i (0-based in Java) where P[i] > P[i+1]. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N -1; ++i) if (map.get(i) > map.get(i+1)) nglist.add(i);\n\nWait, the condition is checking if the position of i is greater than the position of i+1. Wait, the map is storing the positions of the elements. Wait, the elements in P are the permutation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the array P is the permutation. The problem is probably about finding inversions or something similar. The code is checking for each i from 0 to N-2 (since N-1 is the last index), whether the position of i in the permutation is after the position of i+1. Because the map stores the position of each value. So for example, if the permutation is [2,0,1], then P[0] =2, P[1]=0, P[2]=1. The map would have map.get(0) =1 (since P[1] is 0), map.get(1)=2 (since P[2] is 1), map.get(2)=0 (since P[0] is 2). \n\nThen, for i from 0 to N-2, check if map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). For i=0: map.get(0)=1, map.get(1)=2 \u2192 1 < 2 \u2192 no. For i=1: map.get(1)=2, map.get(2)=0 \u2192 2>0 \u2192 yes, so add 1 to nglist. So nglist would have 1 in this case.\n\nThe nglist is the list of indices (i) where the position of i is after the position of i+1. So the problem is looking for the \"bad\" positions where the permutation's elements are out of order in some way.\n\nThe nglist is then used to compute the answer. The first part of the answer is the minimum between (N - first element of nglist -1) and (last element of nglist +1). Then, for each pair of consecutive elements in nglist, compute the sum of their positions plus 1 and N minus the next position minus 1, and take the minimum.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex, but in Fortran, we can represent the nglist as an array. Since in Java it's a list, in Fortran we can pre-allocate an array of size N-1 (since the maximum possible elements in nglist is N-1). Then, we can track the count of elements in the list.\n\nSo steps for first program in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and P array (subtract 1 from each element as in Java).\n2. Create pos array as above.\n3. Initialize nglist array and a counter (say, count) to track the number of elements.\n4. Loop over i from 0 to N-2 (since in Java it's N-1 elements, but in Fortran, since the elements are 0-based in the loop, but the indices here are 0-based in Java terms). Wait, in Fortran, the loop variable for i (the current value being checked) would be from 0 to N-2 (since in Java it's i from 0 to N-2). Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i < N-1; ++i), so i runs from 0 to N-2. So in Fortran, we can loop over i from 0 to N-2 (but in Fortran, variables are integers, so perhaps using a loop variable from 0 to N-2, but in Fortran loops start at 1, so maybe need to adjust).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variable can be an integer. Let me think:\n\nWe can loop over i from 0 to N-2 (inclusive). To do this in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = 0, N-2\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable can start at 0 if declared as integer. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variable is an integer, so yes, that's possible.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to N-2:\n\nif pos(i) > pos(i+1), then add i to nglist.\n\nWait, pos(i) is the position (0-based in Java) of the value i. Because the map in Java stored the position of each value. So in Fortran, pos(i) is the index (0-based) where the value i is located in the permutation array P.\n\nWait, yes. So for each i from 0 to N-2, check if the position of i is greater than the position of i+1. If so, add i to the nglist.\n\nOnce the nglist is built, if it's empty, output 0. Else compute the answer.\n\nThe answer is the minimum between (N - first element of nglist -1) and (last element +1). Then, for each pair of consecutive elements in nglist, compute (current +1) + (N - next -1) and compare with the current minimum.\n\nSo in Fortran, after building the nglist array with count elements, we can proceed as follows:\n\nif count ==0 then ans1 =0\n\nelse:\n\nans = min( (N - nglist(1) -1), (nglist(count) +1) )\n\nthen loop over i from 1 to count-1:\n\ntemp = nglist(i) +1 + (N - nglist(i+1) -1)\n\nif temp < ans then ans = temp\n\nthen set ans1 = ans\n\nSo that's the first program's output.\n\nNow, the second program takes this ans1 as x, and outputs 1 if x !=1, else 0. So in Fortran, ans2 = 1 - (ans1 ==1). Because if ans1 is 1, then 1 -1 =0, else 1.\n\nThird program takes ans2 as n, and computes the sum as per the third Java program.\n\nThe third program's code is straightforward. The loop runs from i=1 to n (inclusive). For each i, compute term = i * (n//i) * (n//i +1)/2. Sum all terms.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i < n+1; i++), which is equivalent to 1 to n. The term is i multiplied by (n/i) multiplied by (n/i +1)/2. Since in Java, integer division is done with / operator. So in Fortran, we can use integer division with /.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step is:\n\nans3 = 0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    k = n / i\n\n    term = i * k * (k +1) / 2\n\n    ans3 = ans3 + term\n\nend do\n\nThen output ans3.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the input for the first program (N and the array of N integers), process all three steps, and output the final result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\n- Read N, then read N integers into P array (1-based, but each element is the input value minus 1).\n\n- Then process first program's logic to get ans1.\n\n- Then compute ans2 = 1 - (ans1 ==1).\n\n- Then compute ans3 using ans2 as n.\n\n- Finally, print ans3.\n\nNow, handling the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read N, then the array P. Let's see:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, j, count, ans1, ans2, ans3, n_third\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: P, nglist\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: pos\n\n!

Second program's step\n\nans2 = 1 - (ans1 ==1)  ! 1 if ans1 is not 1, else 0\n\n! Third program's step\n\nn_third = ans2\n\nans3 =0\n\ndo i=1, n_third\n\n    k = n_third / i\n\n    ans3 = ans3 + i * k * (k +1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans3\n\ndeallocate(P, pos, nglist)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. Let me check the variables:\n\n- temp is used in the loop for ans1 calculation. Need to declare it as integer.\n\nAlso, in the first part, when building nglist, the array is allocated as size N-1. But if N is 1, then N-1 is 0, but in that case, the loop for building nglist would not run (since N-2 would be -1, so the loop from 0 to -1 is not executed). So the allocation for nglist(N-1) when N=1 would be 0 elements, but in Fortran, can we have arrays of size 0? Probably not. So perhaps better to allocate nglist with size N, since N-1 can be up to N-1 elements. Alternatively, set the initial allocation to N, which is safe.\n\nWait, in the code above, when N=1, N-1 is 0, so the allocation would be nglist(0), which may not be allowed. So better to allocate nglist as size N, since the maximum possible count is N-1 (when every adjacent pair is bad, but for N=1, there are no pairs). So changing the allocation to:\n\nallocate(nglist(N))\n\nThen, in the loop, count can go up to N-1, which is within the allocated size.\n\nAlso, in the code, the variables:\n\ntemp is needed in the loop for ans1. So need to declare it as integer.\n\nSo adding:\n\ninteger :: temp\n\nAlso, in the first part, when initializing pos array, in Fortran, to set all elements to -1, we can do:\n\npos = -1\n\nBut in Fortran, this is allowed for arrays. So that's okay.\n\nNow, let me check the code again with these corrections.\n\nAlso, in the third program's loop, the loop variable i runs from 1 to n_third. If n_third is 0, then the loop doesn't run, and ans3 remains 0. But according to the second program's output, ans2 can be 0 or 1. So n_third can be 0 or 1. Wait, the second program's output is 0 or 1. So when ans1 is 1, ans2 is 0. So n_third can be 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the third program's input is n_third, which is the output of the second program. The third program's code in Java reads n via sc.nextInt(). So if the second program outputs 0, then the third program's n is 0, but the loop runs from 1 to 0, which in Fortran would not execute. The sum would be 0. But according to the third program's code, when n is 0, the loop doesn't run, so the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first program's calculation of ans1, when count is 1 (only one element in nglist). Then the loop over i from 1 to count-1 (which is 0) doesn't run, so ans1 remains as the initial min between (N - first element -1) and (last element +1). Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose first program's input is N=3 and P as [2,0,1], which in Java would be stored as P[0]=2-1=1? Wait no, wait the input numbers are read as integers, then subtract 1. Wait in the first Java program, the code is:\n\nP[i] = scan.nextInt() -1;\n\nSo for input numbers 2,0,1, the P array would be [1, -1, 0]? Wait no, wait the input numbers are the permutation elements. Wait the problem is probably that the permutation is a permutation of 0..N-1. So the input numbers are 1-based, but in the code, they are stored as 0-based. So for example, if the input is 2 0 1 (for N=3), then the P array would be [1, -1, 0]? No, wait no. Wait the input numbers are the permutation elements. For example, if the input is 2 0 1, then each is read as scan.nextInt(), then subtract 1. So P[0] =2-1=1, P[1]=0-1=-1? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem's first Java program is for a problem where P is a permutation of 0..N-1. So the input numbers must be 1-based? Or 0-based?\n\nWait, the problem's first Java program is for a problem where the input is a permutation of 1..N, and then subtract 1 to make it 0-based. So the input numbers are 1-based, and stored as 0-based in P.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 3 followed by 2 0 1, that would be invalid because 0 is not in 1..3. So the actual input numbers must be 1-based. So for N=3, the input numbers could be 2,3,1 (assuming 1-based). Then P would be [1,2,0].\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem's first program's input. Since the code is from an AtCoder problem, perhaps the first program is for AGC024 B, which is a problem where the input is a permutation of 1..N, and the code converts them to 0-based.\n\nSo in the first program's input, the numbers are 1-based, and stored as 0-based in P.\n\nThus, in Fortran, when reading the input numbers, each is read as is, then subtract 1 to get 0-based.\n\nSo the code for reading P is correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take N=3, input P as 2 0 1 (but that would be invalid as 0 is not in 1..3). So perhaps a valid input is N=3, and the input numbers are 2,3,1. Then P becomes [1,2,0].\n\nThen pos array:\n\npos(0) is the index (0-based in Java) where the value 0 is located. In P, the value 0 is at index 2 (Java's 0-based index 2 corresponds to Fortran's P(3) which is 0). So pos(0) =2 (Java's index).\n\npos(1) is the index where value 1 is located. In P, value 1 is at index 0 (Java's 0-based index 0 \u2192 Fortran's P(1)=1 \u2192 P(1) is 1, so P(1) -1 is 0? Wait no, sorry, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, in the example where input numbers are 2,3,1 (for N=3):\n\nThe input numbers are 2,3,1. So each is read into P as:\n\nP(1) =2 -1 =1\n\nP(2)=3-1=2\n\nP(3)=1-1=0\n\nSo the P array in Fortran (1-based) is [1,2,0].\n\nThen pos array:\n\npos(0) is the index (Java's 0-based) where value 0 is located. In P, the value 0 is at index 2 (Java's index 2 \u2192 Fortran's P(3) is 0). So pos(0) =2 (Java's index).\n\npos(1) is the index where value 1 is located \u2192 P(1) is 1 \u2192 Java's index 0 \u2192 pos(1)=0.\n\npos(2) is the index where value 2 is located \u2192 P(2) is 2 \u2192 Java's index 1 \u2192 pos(2)=1.\n\nNow, building nglist:\n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-2 (0 to 1):\n\ni=0: check pos(0) (2) vs pos(1) (0). 2>0 \u2192 yes. So add 0 to nglist.\n\ni=1: check pos(1)=0 vs pos(2)=1 \u2192 0 <1 \u2192 no. So only 0 is added.\n\nThus, nglist has count=1, elements [0].\n\nThen ans1 is min( N -0 -1 =3-0-1=2, 0+1=1 \u2192 min(2,1)=1. Then since count-1 is 0, the loop doesn't run. So ans1 is 1.\n\nThen ans2 =1 - (1==1) \u2192 0.\n\nThird program's n_third is 0. The loop from 1 to 0 doesn't run, so ans3 is 0. So the final output is 0.\n\nWait, but let's see what the third program would do with n=0. The third program's code in Java would have n=0, then the loop runs from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute. So the sum is 0. So the output is 0, which matches.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take N=2, input P as [2,1]. Wait, but for N=2, the input numbers must be 1 and 2. So input numbers 2 and 1. Then P becomes [1,0].\n\npos(0) is index 1 (Java's index 1 \u2192 Fortran's P(2)=0 \u2192 pos(0)=1).\n\npos(1) is index 0 (Java's index 0 \u2192 P(1)=1).\n\nnglist: i=0 (since N-1=1, so i runs from 0 to 0).\n\nCheck pos(0)=1 vs pos(1)=0 \u2192 1>0 \u2192 yes. So nglist has [0].\n\nans1 is min(2-0-1=1, 0+1=1 \u2192 min is 1. So ans2 is 0. Third program's n is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother case where ans1 is 0. Suppose the permutation is already sorted. For example N=3, input 1 2 3 \u2192 P becomes [0,1,2].\n\nThen pos(0)=0, pos(1)=1, pos(2)=2.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 1:\n\ni=0: pos(0)=0 vs pos(1)=1 \u2192 0 <1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: pos(1)=1 vs pos(2)=2 \u2192 no. So nglist is empty. So ans1 is 0. Then ans2 is 1 (since 0 !=1). Then third program's n is 1. Compute the sum for n=1:\n\ni=1:\n\nk =1/1=1 \u2192 term =1 *1*(1+1)/2 =1*1*2/2=1 \u2192 sum is 1. So output is 1.\n\nSo the final output would be 1.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI need to make sure all variables are declared properly, and the arrays are allocated correctly.\n\nAlso, in the first part, when building nglist, the array is allocated as N elements (since N-1 could be up to N-1, but N is the size). So the allocation is:\n\nallocate(nglist(N))\n\nThen, in the loop, count can go up to N-1, which is within the allocated size.\n\nAlso, in the code, the variables:\n\ntemp is declared as integer.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nHere's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, j, count, ans1, ans2, ans3, n_third\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: P, nglist\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: pos\n    integer :: temp\n\n    ! Read input for first program\n    read*, N\n    allocate(P(N))\n    allocate(pos(0:N-1))\n    allocate(nglist(N))  ! Maximum possible elements is N-1, so N is safe\n\n    count = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read*, P(i)\n        P(i) = P(i) - 1  ! Convert to 0-based\n    end do\n\n    ! Initialize pos array\n    pos = -1  ! Initialize all to -1\n    do j = 1, N\n        pos(P(j)) = j - 1  ! Java's index is j-1 (0-based)\n    end do\n\n    ! Build nglist\n    count = 0\n    do i = 0, N-2\n        if (pos(i) > pos(i+1)) then\n            count = count + 1\n            nglist(count) = i\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute ans1\n    if (count == 0) then\n        ans1 = 0\n    else\n        ans1 = min( (N - nglist(1) - 1), (nglist(count) + 1) )\n        do i = 1, count - 1\n            temp = nglist(i) + 1 + (N - nglist(i+1) - 1)\n            if (temp < ans1) then\n                ans1 = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end if\n\n    ! Second program's step\n    ans2 = 1 - (ans1 == 1)\n\n    ! Third program's step\n    n_third = ans2\n    ans3 = 0\n    do i = 1, n_third\n        integer :: k\n        k = n_third / i\n        ans3 = ans3 + i * k * (k + 1) / 2\n    end do\n\n    print*, ans3\n\n    deallocate(P, pos, nglist)\nend program main\n\nWait, in the third program's loop, I added an integer declaration for k inside the loop. But in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. So that's an error. Need to declare k outside.\n\nSo correct the code:\n\nIn the third program's loop:\n\ndeclare k as integer before the loop.\n\nSo:\n\n! Third program's step\nn_third = ans2\nans3 =0\ninteger :: k  ! declare here\n\ndo i=1, n_third\n    k = n_third / i\n    ans3 = ans3 + i * k * (k +1)/2\nend do\n\nAlternatively, declare k at the top with other variables.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nAdding k to the variable declarations:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, j, count, ans1, ans2, ans3, n_third, k\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: P, nglist\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: pos\n    integer :: temp\n\n    ! ... rest of code ...\n\n    ! Third program's step\n    n_third = ans2\n    ans3 =0\n    do i=1, n_third\n        k = n_third / i\n        ans3 = ans3 + i * k * (k +1)/2\n    end do\n\n    print*, ans3\n\n    deallocate(P, pos, nglist)\nend program main\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first program's loop for building nglist, the loop variable i is from 0 to N-2. In Fortran, the loop variable can be an integer, so that's okay.\n\nNow, this should handle all steps correctly.\n\nTesting the code with the earlier example where N=3, input 2 3 1 (so P becomes [1,2,0]):\n\nThe nglist has count=1 (i=0). ans1 is min(3-0-1=2 vs 0+1=1 \u2192 1. ans2 is 0. Third program's n_third=0 \u2192 ans3=0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case where N=3, input 1 2 3 \u2192 P is [0,1,2]. nglist is empty \u2192 ans1=0 \u2192 ans2=1 \u2192 third program with n=1:\n\nsum for i=1: k=1/1=1 \u2192 term=1*1*(2)/2 =1 \u2192 ans3=1. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case where N=2, input 2 1 \u2192 P is [1,0]. pos(0)=1, pos(1)=0. i=0: pos(0)=1 > pos(1)=0 \u2192 yes. nglist has [0]. ans1 is min(2-0-1=1 vs 0+1=1 \u2192 1. ans2=0 \u2192 third program's n=0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as above."
