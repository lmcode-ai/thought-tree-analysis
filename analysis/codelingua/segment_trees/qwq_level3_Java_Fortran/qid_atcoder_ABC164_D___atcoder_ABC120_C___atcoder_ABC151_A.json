    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC164_D). It reads a string S from input, processes it to compute some count related to mod 2019, and outputs the result. The main steps here are calculating the mod array and counting pairs. The output of this program is the 'ans' value, which should be the input for the next program.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC120_C) takes a string, processes it with a stack to count pairs of '0' and '1', and outputs twice the count. The input here should be the output from the first program. Wait, but the first program outputs a number, so the second program expects a string input. Hmm, but the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output (a number) must be passed as a string. So the first program's output is a number, which becomes the input string for the second program. The second program's output is another number, which then becomes the input for the third program.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a single character string, and outputs the next character. Wait, looking at the code: it reads a line (s), then prints the first character plus 1. So if the input is a number like \"123\", it would take the first character '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50 which is '2', so output \"2\". But if the input is a two-digit number like \"25\", it would output '3'? Wait, no, the first character is '2', so adding 1 gives '3'. So the third program's output is the next ASCII character of the first character of its input.\n\nSo the overall flow is: input -> first program's output (number) -> second program's input (as a string) -> second's output (number) -> third's input (as a string) -> third's output (the next character of first char of that number).\n\nNow, the task is to combine all three into a single Fortran program. The key is to process each step's output as the next's input without I/O in between. So in Fortran, I need to structure the code so that the first part's result is passed to the second's processing, then the second's result to the third's, and only the first reads input, the last writes output.\n\nLet me break down each Java program's logic into steps.\n\nFirst program (ABC164_D):\n\n- Read S (input string)\n- Compute mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays for mod 2019\n- Calculate ans as the sum over mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 plus 1 for 0 mod case?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as an array of 2019 elements, all 0. Then for each position i in mod_arr, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. Then, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 (because the code says mod_cnt[0]++). Wait, why?\n\nWait, the code:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized to 0. Then, for each i, mod_arr[i] is set, and mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. Then after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. Then the loop over mod_cnt adds mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 for each i. The initial mod_cnt[0] was incremented by 1, so that's adding the case where the prefix itself is 0 mod 2019?\n\nHmm, perhaps the logic is counting the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], which would mean that the substring from i+1 to j has a mod 2019 of 0. The formula for the number of pairs is indeed n*(n-1)/2 for each count n. But the code adds mod_cnt[0]++ before the loop, which might be to account for the empty prefix? Or maybe the initial 0 is considered as a prefix. Let me think again.\n\nThe code initializes mod_arr and mod_cnt. The first element is mod_arr[0] = (digit * 10^0 mod 2019) or something. Wait, the code's loop is for i from 0 to N-1. The S is processed from the end. Let me see:\n\nThe loop is for i from 0 to N-1:\n\ntmp is (digit at position N-1 -i) * radix mod 2019. The digit is S.charAt(N-1 -i) which is the ith character from the end (since N-1 -i starts at N-1, then N-2, etc. So for i=0, it's the last character, i=1 the second last, etc. So the digits are processed from right to left.\n\nThe radix starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 2019. So the first iteration (i=0) is the last digit multiplied by 1 (10^0), then next is 10^1, etc. So the calculation is for the number formed by the suffix up to that position, but in a way that allows mod 2019 to be tracked efficiently.\n\nThe mod_arr[i] is the mod value of the number formed by the suffix up to that position. The mod_cnt counts how many times each mod value occurs. The ans counts the number of pairs of indices where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], which gives the number of substrings divisible by 2019. The code then adds mod_cnt[0]++, which might be to account for the empty prefix? Wait, perhaps the initial 0 is considered as a prefix. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code initializes mod_cnt as all zeros. Then, for each i, mod_arr[i] is computed and mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. After the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. So the total for mod 0 is mod_cnt[0] (original count) +1. Then the ans is sum over all mod counts of (count choose 2). The +1 for mod 0 is because the empty prefix (before the first digit) has mod 0, so any occurrence of mod 0 in mod_arr would form a pair with that empty prefix. So the code is considering the empty prefix as part of the count. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo the first program's output is the number of such pairs.\n\nSecond program (ABC120_C):\n\nIt takes a string x, processes it with a stack. The stack is used to count pairs of '0' and '1' in any order. Each time two consecutive elements (in the stack) form '0' and '1' or '1' and '0', they are popped and counted. The total count is multiplied by 2 (since each pair contributes two characters). The input here is the output of the first program, which is a number. So the input to the second program is the string representation of that number. For example, if the first program outputs 123, the second program's input is \"123\".\n\nThe second program's output is the count *2. So if the input is \"123\", the stack processing would process each character. Let's see:\n\nProcessing \"123\":\n\nStart with stack empty. Push '1'. Stack has ['1'].\n\nNext character '2': push. Stack is ['1','2']. Check the top two: '2' and '1' (since stack is LIFO?), wait no. Wait the stack is pushed in order. Let me think step by step:\n\nWait the code loops over each character in x (the input string). For each character, it pushes to the stack. Then, while the stack has at least two elements, it pops the top two (p and q, with p being the top, q the next). If they form a '0' and '1' pair (in any order), then count increases, and the loop continues. Else, push them back and break.\n\nWait the code:\n\nfor each character in x:\n\n    push to stack.\n\n    then, while stack.size() >1:\n\n        p = pop, q = pop.\n\n        if (p and q are 0 and 1 in any order):\n\n            c +=1\n\n            continue (so loop again, check next top two)\n\n        else:\n\n            push back q and p, break the loop.\n\nSo after pushing each character, it tries to find pairs in the stack. The process continues until no more pairs can be found.\n\nThe final count is multiplied by 2 and printed.\n\nSo for input \"123\":\n\nProcessing '1' \u2192 stack [1]. No pair.\n\nThen '2' \u2192 stack [1,2]. Check top two: 2 and 1. Not 0/1 pair. So push back, break. So no count.\n\nThen '3' \u2192 stack [1,2,3]. Check top two (3 and 2): no. So nothing. So total c is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother example: input \"01\" \u2192 after pushing '0', then '1':\n\nAfter pushing '1', stack has [0,1]. Then check:\n\np=1, q=0. They form a pair \u2192 c becomes 1. Then, since we continue (the 'continue' statement), the loop continues. Now the stack is empty (since we popped both). So the loop ends. So c is 1 \u2192 output 2.\n\nAnother example: \"0101\" \u2192 let's see:\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFirst '0' \u2192 stack [0]. No pair.\n\nThen '1' \u2192 stack [0,1]. Check: p=1, q=0 \u2192 pair. c becomes 1. Then, after popping both, stack is empty. So continue? The loop condition is stack.size()>1? After popping both, stack is empty, so loop stops. So after this step, c is 1.\n\nNext character '0' \u2192 push. Stack [0]. No pair.\n\nNext '1' \u2192 push. Stack [0,1]. Again, pair \u2192 c becomes 2. So total 2 \u2192 output 4.\n\nSo the second program's output is twice the number of such pairs found in the input string.\n\nThird program (ABC151_A):\n\nIt reads a string (the input is a single line), takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. So if the input is \"123\", it outputs '2' (since '1' +1 is '2'). If the input is \"9\", it outputs ':', etc. So the third program's output is the next character in the ASCII sequence of the first character of its input.\n\nNow, the overall flow is:\n\nInput \u2192 first program's output (number) \u2192 second program's input (as a string) \u2192 second's output (number) \u2192 third's input (as a string) \u2192 third's output (character).\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the first program's input S).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans1).\n\n3. Convert ans1 to a string (as the input for the second program).\n\n4. Process that string through the second program's logic to get ans2 (the second's output).\n\n5. Convert ans2 to a string (input for third program).\n\n6. Process that string through the third program's logic to get the final character.\n\n7. Output that character.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst Program (ABC164_D):\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Read a string S from input.\n\n- Compute N = length of S.\n\n- Initialize mod_arr (array of size N), mod_cnt (array of size 2019, initialized to 0).\n\n- Initialize radix = 1.\n\n- Loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   - The current character is S(N-1 -i) (since in Java, it's S.charAt(N-1 -i), which is the ith character from the end, starting at 0).\n\n   - Convert that character to a digit (digit = ichar(S(i+1)) - ichar('0') in Fortran, but need to index correctly).\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So if S is a character array, S(1) is first character. So in the Java code, for i from 0 to N-1, the character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). So in Fortran, the index would be (N - i) since N-1 -i +1 (since Fortran starts at 1). Wait let's see:\n\nJava's S has length N. The first character is S[0], last is S[N-1].\n\nIn Fortran, if S is a character array of length N, then S(1) is first, S(N) is last.\n\nSo for i from 0 to N-1 in Java:\n\nJava's index is N-1 -i \u2192 which is (N-1 -i) \u2192 in Fortran, that would be (N - i) because (N-1 -i) +1 = N -i.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's S.charAt(N-1 -i) \u2192 the position is (N-1 -i) in 0-based. In Fortran, the same position is (N -i) in 1-based.\n\nSo the digit is S(N -i) - '0' (as a character code).\n\nThen, tmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nIf i !=0, then add mod_arr(i-1) to tmp, then mod 2019 again.\n\nWait, in Java, mod_arr is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 0-based arrays, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Hmm, need to adjust indices.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the loops.\n\nAlternatively, use arrays with lower bound 0. In Fortran, you can declare arrays with a lower bound of 0, but it's a bit tricky. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the indices to 1-based.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran for the first part:\n\nRead the input string S (character(len=...)), then get its length N.\n\nInitialize mod_arr(0:N-1) \u2192 but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So perhaps mod_arr(1:N) and adjust the loop accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) \u2192 i from 0 to N-1.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop i from 1 to N, but adjust the indices.\n\nWait, let me reindex:\n\nLet me think of the Fortran variables:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(2019) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger :: N, radix, tmp, digit\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S\n\nRead S from input. Let's say S is read as a string, then N = len_trim(S).\n\nmod_arr needs to be of size N. So allocate mod_arr(1:N).\n\nmod_cnt is size 2019, initialized to 0.\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to N (since in Java, i goes from 0 to N-1, so in Fortran, i from 1 to N corresponds to Java's i from 0 to N-1).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for each i in 0..N-1:\n\ndigit = S.charAt(N-1 -i) \u2192 which is the (N-1 -i)th character (0-based). In Fortran, the same character is S(N -i) (since 1-based).\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let N=5 (so indices 0-4 in Java). For i=0, the character is S[4] (the last character). In Fortran, that's S(5). So for i=1 (Java's i=0), the Fortran index would be N - i \u2192 5-1=4? Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, the first character is 1, so for N=5, the last character is 5. So for Java's i=0 (the first iteration), the character is S[4], which is S(5) in Fortran. So in Fortran, the character is S(N - (i-1)), where i is the loop variable starting at 1?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust the loop variable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, loop over i from 1 to N, and the character is S(N - i +1). Let's see:\n\nJava's i runs from 0 to N-1 \u2192 total N steps.\n\nIn Fortran, i runs from 1 to N \u2192 same number of steps.\n\nFor each i in Fortran's loop (1 to N):\n\nJava's i is (i-1). So the character in Java is S[N-1 - (i-1)] = S[N -i].\n\nIn Fortran, that's S(N -i +1) ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's index for the character is (N-1 - (i-1)) = N -i.\n\nIn Fortran, the same position is (N -i) +1? Wait no. Wait, in Fortran, the first character is 1, so the position in Java's 0-based is (N -i) \u2192 in Fortran, that's (N -i) +1? Wait no, no. Wait, the Java index is (N-1 - (i-1)) \u2192 which is N -i. So in Fortran, the character is at position (N -i +1) ?\n\nWait, let me take N=5, i=1 (Fortran's first iteration):\n\nJava's i is 0 \u2192 character at 4 (0-based) \u2192 which is S(5) in Fortran (since 0-based 4 is 1-based 5). So in Fortran, the position is N - (i-1) \u2192 N -0 =5 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is S(N - (i-1)) \u2192 because in Fortran, the first character is 1, so the Java's index (N-1 - (i-1)) = N -i \u2192 so in Fortran, the position is (N -i) +1? Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nJava's index for the character is (N-1 - (i-1)) \u2192 which is N -i.\n\nIn Fortran, the 1-based index is (N -i) +1? No, because 0-based to 1-based is adding 1. So the 0-based index N -i \u2192 1-based is (N -i) +1? Wait no, 0-based index x \u2192 1-based is x+1. So if Java's index is (N -i), then in Fortran it's (N -i) +1.\n\nWait, for N=5 and i=1 (Fortran's first iteration):\n\nJava's i is 0 \u2192 Java's index is 4 \u2192 1-based is 5 \u2192 which is (N -i) +1 \u2192 5-1=4 \u2192 4+1=5 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so the character is S( (N -i) +1 ) \u2192 S(N -i +1).\n\nWait, N -i +1 \u2192 for i=1, N -1 +1 = N \u2192 correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the digit is ichar(S(N -i +1)) - ichar('0').\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   current_char = S(N -i +1)\n\n   digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n   tmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\n   if (i > 1) then\n\n      tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\n   end if\n\n   mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n   mod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1  ! Because mod_cnt is 1-based in Fortran?\n\nWait, mod_cnt is an array of size 2019. In Java, it's 0-based (indices 0 to 2018). In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so mod_cnt(1) to mod_cnt(2019). So to map Java's mod value (0-2018) to Fortran's array, we can add 1. So mod_cnt(tmp +1) would be the correct index.\n\nWait, in Java, mod_cnt is initialized to all 0. Then, for each tmp (0-2018), mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. So in Fortran, mod_cnt( tmp +1 ) is the correct index.\n\nSo after computing tmp, we do mod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1.\n\nThen, after the loop, we need to do mod_cnt(0 +1) = mod_cnt(1) +=1 \u2192 because in Java, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. So in Fortran, mod_cnt(1) = mod_cnt(1) +1.\n\nThen, the ans is the sum over all mod_cnt elements of (count)*(count-1)/2.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nmod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 (so mod_cnt[0] becomes original count +1).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2018:\n\nans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nans = 0\n\nmod_cnt(1) = mod_cnt(1) +1\n\ndo i = 1, 2019\n\n   ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) -1) / 2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is from 0 to 2018, so in Fortran, the loop is 1 to 2019. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the mod values can only go up to 2018 (since mod 2019). So mod_cnt(2019) corresponds to mod 2018 in Java. So the loop is correct.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would compute ans1 as the first program's output.\n\nSecond program (ABC120_C):\n\nThe input is the string representation of ans1. So in Fortran, we need to convert ans1 (an integer) to a string. Let's say ans1 is stored as an integer variable. We can use write to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans1\n\nwrite(str_ans1, '(i0)') ans1\n\nThen, trim the string to remove leading spaces (if any). But in Fortran, the write statement with '(i0)' should write the number without leading spaces. So the string is the correct input for the second program.\n\nThen, process this string through the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\nInitialize a stack (in Fortran, perhaps an array with a pointer for top).\n\nInitialize count c to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the string:\n\n   push to stack.\n\n   then, while the stack has at least two elements:\n\n      pop p and q (the top two elements).\n\n      if p and q are '0' and '1' in any order:\n\n          c +=1\n\n          continue the loop (so check again the new top elements)\n\n      else:\n\n          push back q and p, break the loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, the stack can be represented as an array with a top index. Let's say:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_stack = 100000  ! some large enough size.\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(max_stack) :: stack\n\ninteger :: top =0, c=0\n\nThen, for each character in the string (str_ans1):\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = current_char\n\n   do while (top >=2)\n\n      p = stack(top)\n\n      q = stack(top-1)\n\n      if ( (p == '0' .and. q == '1') .or. (p == '1' .and. q == '0') ) then\n\n          c = c +1\n\n          top = top -2  ! pop both\n\n      else\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then continue the loop (so check again the new top elements). So the loop continues until no more pairs can be found.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then the code continues the loop (the 'continue' statement). So the loop continues, and the next iteration will check the new top elements (since the stack has been reduced by two). So in Fortran, after popping both (i.e., top is decremented by 2), the loop continues. The loop is a while loop that continues as long as the stack has at least two elements.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nwhile (s.size() >1) {\n\n   p = pop, q = pop.\n\n   if pair \u2192 c++, continue (so loop again)\n\n   else \u2192 push back and break.\n\n}\n\nWait, in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then the code increments c and continues the loop (so the next iteration of the while loop will check the new top elements). If not, then push back q and p, and break the loop (so the while loop exits).\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\nafter pushing the current character, enter a loop:\n\ndo while (top >=2)\n\n   p = stack(top)\n\n   q = stack(top-1)\n\n   if ( (p == '0' .and. q == '1') .or. (p == '1' .and. q == '0') ) then\n\n       c = c +1\n\n       top = top -2\n\n   else\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the pair is found, the code continues the loop (so the next iteration will check again the new top elements). In the Fortran code above, after decrementing top by 2, the loop continues, so that's correct.\n\nWait, in the code above, after popping (by decrementing top by 2), the loop continues, so the next iteration will check the new top elements. That's exactly what the Java code does.\n\nSo the Fortran code for the second part is manageable.\n\nOnce the loop over all characters is done, the output is c *2 \u2192 ans2 = 2*c.\n\nThird program (ABC151_A):\n\nThe input is the string representation of ans2. So convert ans2 to a string, then take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, and output that character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans2\n\nwrite(str_ans2, '(i0)') ans2\n\nthen, the first character is str_ans2(1:1). Its ASCII code is ichar(str_ans2(1:1)), add 1, then convert back to a character with char(ichar(...)+1).\n\nSo the final output is char(ichar(str_ans2(1:1)) +1).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string S.\n\n2. Compute ans1 via the first program's logic.\n\n3. Convert ans1 to a string, process it via the second program's logic to get ans2.\n\n4. Convert ans2 to a string, process via third program's logic to get the final character.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read the input string S. Let's use a character variable with sufficient length. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: S\n\nread(*, '(a)') S\n\nThen, N = len_trim(S).\n\nThen, allocate mod_arr(1:N).\n\nInitialize mod_cnt(1:2019) = 0.\n\nradix =1.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to N:\n\ndigit = ichar(S(N -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\ntmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif (i >1) then\n\n   tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nWait, the radix is updated as (radix *10) mod 2019. So yes.\n\nAfter the loop:\n\nmod_cnt(1) = mod_cnt(1) +1\n\nans1 =0\n\ndo i=1,2019\n\n   ans1 = ans1 + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert ans1 to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans1\n\nwrite(str_ans1, '(i0)') ans1\n\nstr_ans1 = adjustl(str_ans1)  ! to remove leading spaces, but i0 should not have them.\n\nThen process the second program's logic.\n\nInitialize stack and variables:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_stack = 100000\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(max_stack) :: stack\n\ninteger :: top =0, c=0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(str_ans1)\n\n   current_char = str_ans1(i:i)\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = current_char\n\n   do while (top >=2)\n\n      p = stack(top)\n\n      q = stack(top-1)\n\n      if ( (p == '0' .and. q == '1') .or. (p == '1' .and. q == '0') ) then\n\n          c = c +1\n\n          top = top -2\n\n      else\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nans2 = 2 * c\n\nThen, convert ans2 to string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans2\n\nwrite(str_ans2, '(i0)') ans2\n\nstr_ans2 = adjustl(str_ans2)\n\nThen, the third program's step:\n\nif (len_trim(str_ans2) ==0) then\n\n   ! handle error? but input should be valid.\n\nelse\n\n   first_char = str_ans2(1:1)\n\n   result_char = char(ichar(first_char) +1)\n\n   write(*, '(a)') result_char\n\nend if\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran code would look like this.\n\nNow, some considerations:\n\n- The stack size: the input string for the second program is the output of the first, which can be up to, say, 1e5 digits? Probably, but the problem constraints for the first program's input S may have a maximum length. But since the code is supposed to handle any input, we can set max_stack to a large enough value, like 1e5 or 1e6.\n\n- The mod array and mod_cnt arrays: mod_arr is size N, which can be up to the length of S. Since in Java, the first program can handle S up to 1e5 characters (as per typical programming contest constraints), but in Fortran, we can allocate mod_arr dynamically. Wait, in the code above, I used allocatable arrays? Wait, in the code outline above, I assumed mod_arr is allocated, but in the code I wrote, I used fixed arrays. Wait, in the code outline, I need to use allocatable arrays for mod_arr.\n\nWait, in the first part, the code needs to read S, get its length N, then allocate mod_arr(1:N). So in Fortran:\n\nallocate(mod_arr(1:N))\n\nBut in the code outline above, I didn't use allocatable variables. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, variables:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: S\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(2019) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger :: radix, tmp, digit, ans1, i, j\n\nread(*, '(a)') S\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nallocate(mod_arr(1:N))\n\nmod_cnt = 0\n\nradix =1\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   current_char = S(N -i +1)\n\n   digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n   tmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\n   if (i >1) then\n\n      tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\n   end if\n\n   mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n   mod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1\n\n   radix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nend do\n\nmod_cnt(1) = mod_cnt(1) +1\n\nans1 =0\n\ndo j=1,2019\n\n   ans1 = ans1 + mod_cnt(j) * (mod_cnt(j)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(mod_arr)\n\nThen proceed with the second part.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so the code should be okay.\n\nNow, the second part's stack:\n\nWe can use a fixed array, assuming the input string (str_ans1) is not too long. Since ans1 can be up to (for N=1e5 digits, the maximum possible value is 1e100000, but mod 2019, but the count ans1 can be up to (2019 choose 2) which is manageable. Wait, no, the ans1 is the number of pairs, which for N digits can be up to N*(N-1)/2, which for N=1e5 is ~5e9, but stored as an integer. So converting to a string would be up to 10 digits (since 5e9 is 10 digits). So the second program's input string is manageable with a small stack.\n\nThus, the max_stack can be set to, say, 100000.\n\nPutting all together, the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=100000) :: S\n    integer :: N\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n    integer, dimension(2019) :: mod_cnt\n    integer :: radix, tmp, digit, ans1, i, j\n    character(len=20) :: str_ans1, str_ans2\n    integer :: max_stack = 100000\n    character(len=1), dimension(max_stack) :: stack\n    integer :: top, c, ans2\n    character(len=1) :: first_char, result_char\n\n    !

For each character, we push to the stack and process.\n\nTesting this code for sample inputs.\n\nLet me test with an example.\n\nSuppose the input to the first program is \"123\".\n\nFirst program's processing:\n\nS is \"123\", N=3.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 3:\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_char is S(3 -1 +1) = S(3) \u2192 '3'\n\ndigit = 3.\n\nradix is 1 initially.\n\ntmp = 3 *1 mod2019 \u21923.\n\nmod_arr(1)=3 \u2192 mod_cnt(3+1=4) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_char is S(3-2+1)=S(2) \u2192 '2'\n\ndigit=2.\n\ntmp = 2 *10 mod2019 \u219220.\n\nSince i>1, add mod_arr(1)=3 \u219220+3=23 mod2019 \u219223.\n\nmod_arr(2)=23 \u2192 mod_cnt(24) +=1.\n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod2019 \u2192100.\n\ni=3:\n\ncurrent_char is S(3-3+1)=S(1) \u2192 '1'\n\ndigit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *100 mod2019 \u2192100.\n\nAdd mod_arr(2)=23 \u2192100+23=123 mod2019 \u2192123.\n\nmod_arr(3)=123 \u2192 mod_cnt(124) +=1.\n\nradix becomes 100*10 mod2019 \u21921000 mod2019 is 1000.\n\nAfter loop:\n\nmod_cnt(1) (for mod 0) is 0 (since none of the mod_arr entries were 0). Then mod_cnt(1) is increased by 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nNow, ans1 is sum over mod_cnt(j)*(j-1)/2.\n\nmod_cnt(4) is 1 (from first element), mod_cnt(24)=1, mod_cnt(124)=1, mod_cnt(1) is 1 (after increment).\n\nOther mod_cnt entries are 0 except mod 0's count (now 1).\n\nSo the only contributions are mod 0's count (1) \u2192 1*0/2 =0, and the others are 0 except mod 0's count.\n\nWait, mod_cnt(1) is 1 (mod 0's count after increment). So mod 0's contribution is 1*0/2 =0.\n\nOther mod entries (like mod 3, 23, 123) have counts 1 each, so their terms are 0.\n\nThus ans1 is 0.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the mod_arr entries are 3,23,123. So mod_cnt for 3 is 1 (mod 3 \u2192 index 4?), mod 23 \u2192 index 24, mod 123 \u2192 index 124. mod_cnt(1) (mod 0) is 1 (after increment).\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nmod_cnt(1) * (mod_cnt(1)-1)/2 \u2192 1*0/2 =0.\n\nmod_cnt(4) \u21921 \u2192 1*0/2 =0.\n\nmod_cnt(24) \u21921 \u21920.\n\nmod_cnt(124) \u21921 \u21920.\n\nAll other mod_cnt are 0. So ans1 is 0.\n\nSo the first program's output is 0.\n\nThen, the second program's input is \"0\".\n\nProcessing \"0\":\n\nLoop over each character (only one character '0'):\n\nPush to stack. Stack has [0]. Then, since stack size is 1, no further processing.\n\nc remains 0. So ans2 is 0*2=0.\n\nThird program's input is \"0\".\n\nThe first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'. So output is '1'.\n\nSo the final output is '1'.\n\nLet me see if that's correct.\n\nFirst program's input \"123\" gives ans1=0 \u2192 second program's input is \"0\".\n\nSecond program's processing of \"0\" gives c=0 \u2192 ans2=0 \u2192 third program's input is \"0\" \u2192 output '1'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program input \"0\" (S is \"0\").\n\nN=1.\n\nLoop i=1:\n\ncurrent_char is S(1) \u2192 '0'.\n\ndigit=0.\n\ntmp =0 *1 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nmod_arr(1)=0 \u2192 mod_cnt(1) (since 0+1=1) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10 mod2019.\n\nAfter loop, mod_cnt(1) is 1+1 (because mod_cnt[0] was 1, then +1 \u2192 2.\n\nans1 is mod_cnt(1)*(2-1)/2 \u2192 2*1/2 =1.\n\nSo ans1 is 1.\n\nSecond program's input is \"1\".\n\nProcessing \"1\":\n\nPush '1' \u2192 stack [1]. No pairs. c remains 0 \u2192 ans2=0.\n\nThird program's input is \"0\" \u2192 first character '0' \u2192 output '1'.\n\nWait, no, ans2 is 0 \u2192 input to third is \"0\", so output '1'.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is \"1\", so processing \"1\" gives c=0 \u2192 ans2=0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\".\n\nYes, so output is '1'.\n\nAnother test case: first program input \"10\".\n\nN=2.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1: current_char is S(2) \u2192 '0'.\n\ndigit=0.\n\ntmp =0 *1 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nmod_arr(1)=0 \u2192 mod_cnt(1) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10.\n\ni=2: current_char is S(1) \u2192 '1'.\n\ndigit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\nAdd mod_arr(1)=0 \u219210+0=10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\nmod_arr(2)=10 \u2192 mod_cnt(11) +=1.\n\nAfter loop, mod_cnt(1) (mod0) is 1 +1 (from increment) \u21922.\n\nmod_cnt(11) is 1.\n\nans1 is:\n\nmod0: 2*(2-1)/2 =1.\n\nmod10: 1*0/2 \u21920.\n\nTotal ans1=1.\n\nSecond program's input is \"1\".\n\nSame as before \u2192 ans2=0 \u2192 third outputs '1'.\n\nHmm, but let's see another example where the first program's output is 123.\n\nSuppose first program's output is 123 \u2192 second program's input is \"123\".\n\nProcessing \"123\":\n\nCharacters '1', '2', '3'.\n\nProcessing '1' \u2192 stack [1]. No pairs.\n\nProcessing '2' \u2192 stack [1,2]. Check top two: 2 and 1 \u2192 not 0/1 \u2192 no change. So c remains 0.\n\nProcessing '3' \u2192 stack [1,2,3]. No pairs. So c remains 0 \u2192 ans2=0 \u2192 third outputs '0' +1 \u2192 '1'.\n\nAnother example where first program's output is 2 \u2192 second's input is \"2\".\n\nProcessing gives c=0 \u2192 ans2=0 \u2192 third outputs '1'.\n\nAnother example where first program's output is 1 \u2192 second's input is \"1\" \u2192 same as before.\n\nNow, let's take a case where the second program's input has pairs.\n\nSuppose first program's output is 10 \u2192 second's input is \"10\".\n\nProcessing \"10\":\n\nCharacters '1', '0'.\n\nFirst '1' \u2192 stack [1].\n\nSecond '0' \u2192 push \u2192 stack [1,0].\n\nNow, check the top two: '0' and '1' \u2192 they form a pair (0 and 1). So c increases by 1. Then, pop both, stack is empty. The loop continues (since after popping, stack has 0 elements, so loop exits).\n\nThus c=1 \u2192 ans2=2 \u2192 third's input is \"2\" \u2192 first character '2' \u2192 '3'.\n\nSo the final output is '3'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the code, the second program's processing:\n\nFor the input \"10\":\n\nProcessing '1' \u2192 stack becomes [1]. No pairs.\n\nThen '0' \u2192 stack becomes [1,0].\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ntop is 2 \u2192 enter loop.\n\np is '0', q is '1' \u2192 pair \u2192 c becomes 1. top becomes 0 (2-2=0).\n\nLoop exits.\n\nThus c=1 \u2192 ans2=2 \u2192 third's input is \"2\" \u2192 output '3'.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the code should be correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are properly declared, and the logic follows.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The mod function in Fortran: mod(a,b) returns a remainder with the same sign as b. Since 2019 is positive, mod should work correctly.\n\n- The stack array must be large enough. The max_stack is set to 100000, which should be sufficient for any reasonable input.\n\n- The third program's input is the string of ans2, which is an integer. The write statement with '(i0)' should handle it correctly.\n\n- The first program's mod array is allocated dynamically based on N, which is correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as written above."
