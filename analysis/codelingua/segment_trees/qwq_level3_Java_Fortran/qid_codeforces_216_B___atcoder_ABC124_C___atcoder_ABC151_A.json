    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate three Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. The key points are that the first program reads input, the last outputs, and the middle ones process without I/O. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (codeforces_216_B.java). It reads integers m and n, builds an undirected graph, then uses DFS to find cycles. The output is 'toremove', which is calculated based on cycle counts. The main variables here are the graph structure, the DFS function, and the counting logic. The output is printed at the end.\n\nFile 2 (atcoder_ABC124_C.java) takes a string, modifies it in two different ways to count the minimum changes needed to avoid consecutive duplicates. The input is a string, and the output is the minimum of two counts. This requires processing the string in two passes: one forward and one backward.\n\nFile 3 (atcoder_ABC151_A.java) simply takes a string and outputs the first character incremented by 1. Wait, but the code here is a bit odd. The code says s.charAt(0)+1, but in Java, characters are ASCII, so 'A' becomes 'B', etc. However, the code in File 3's main is very simple, but there's a class RemRing which isn't used here. Since the problem says the sequence is executed in order, the third program's input is the output of the second, and the third's output is the final result. Wait, but the third program's code is only taking the first character of the input string and printing the next character. But the second program's output is a number (the minimum of a1 and a2). Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the second program's output is a number, but the third program expects a string input. Hmm, maybe I need to check the actual flow.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is an integer (toremove), which is then the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nWait, looking at the three Java files, each is a separate program. The user says they are executed in sequence, so the output of the first is input to the second, and the output of the second to the third. But the first program's output is an integer (toremove), which would be the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string (the first line is read as a string via in.next() in the solve method). So that's a problem. Wait, maybe the actual sequence is that each program is run in order, but their inputs and outputs are connected via standard input/output. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first program outputs a number. So the second program would read that number as a string? For example, if the first outputs \"5\", then the second's input is \"5\", and the second processes that string. Then the second's output is a number (the min of a1 and a2), which is then the input to the third program. The third program takes that number as a string (like \"3\"), and outputs the first character plus 1. Wait, but the third program's code is:\n\nIn File 3's main, it reads a line (s = r.readLine()), then outputs the first character plus 1. So if the input is \"3\", then the first character is '3', adding 1 would give '4', so output is '4'. But if the input is a multi-digit number like \"123\", then the first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nFirst program's output (integer) is passed as input to second program (as a string). Second processes it, outputs a number (integer). Third takes that number as a string, outputs first character +1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process all three steps, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic:\n\nThe first program reads m and n, then n pairs of x and y to build an undirected graph. Then it does a DFS to find cycles. The toremove variable is computed based on cycles with odd counts. The final output is toremove adjusted if (m - toremove) is odd.\n\nThe second program takes a string (the output of first is an integer, so the input to second is that integer as a string). The second program processes the string to find the minimal changes needed to make no consecutive duplicates. The output is the minimal count.\n\nThird program takes that count (as a string), takes first character, adds 1, outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, the entire process must be done in one program. Let's structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input for the first Java program. The first Java program's input is m and n followed by n pairs. So in Fortran, we need to read m and n, then read n pairs of integers. Then build the graph.\n\nThen, process the graph as per the first Java's logic to compute toremove.\n\nThen, take that toremove value, convert it to a string (since that's the output of first program, which is the input to second), then process that string as per the second Java's logic to compute the minimal count.\n\nThen, take that count (as a string), process it as per the third Java's logic (take first character, add 1, output as a character).\n\nWait, but the second program's output is a number (the minimal count). So the third program's input is that number as a string. So the steps are:\n\nFirst program's output is integer A. Second program's input is the string representation of A. Second program outputs integer B. Third program's input is the string representation of B, outputs the first character +1.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (m, n, then n pairs).\n\n2. Compute toremove (from first Java's logic).\n\n3. Convert toremove to a string (so that it can be the input to the second step).\n\n4. Process that string through the second Java's logic to get B (the minimal count).\n\n5. Convert B to a string, then take first character, add 1, output as a character.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first program's main steps:\n\n- Read m and n.\n\n- Build an adjacency list for the graph. Since Java uses a LinkedList of LinkedLists, in Fortran, perhaps an array of linked lists or a list of lists. But Fortran doesn't have dynamic lists, so maybe an array of arrays, but since the number of edges can vary, perhaps using a list of edges for each node. Alternatively, since the nodes are numbered from 1 to m, we can have an array of lists. Alternatively, since Fortran arrays are fixed size, perhaps we can pre-allocate an array for each node's edges. But since the edges are undirected, each edge is added to both nodes.\n\nWait, in Java, the graph is stored as a list of lists. For Fortran, perhaps we can represent the graph as an adjacency list using a list of nodes and their edges. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays, perhaps we can read all edges first, then store them in a list for each node. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges is n (each edge is added twice, so total edges are 2n), but m can be up to some value. Let's think of using an array of linked lists. Alternatively, since Fortran 90 allows dynamic arrays, but perhaps it's easier to use a list of edges for each node.\n\nAlternatively, since the DFS is done via recursion, but Fortran doesn't have recursion in the same way. Wait, the first Java program uses a recursive DFS. In Fortran, recursion is possible but may have stack limits. Alternatively, we can implement the DFS iteratively.\n\nHmm, but let's see. The first Java's DFS function is part of the class. The code is:\n\npublic int dfs(int child, int par) {\n    if (seen[child] == true) return cycle;\n    seen[child] = true;\n    for (Integer i : graph.get(child)) {\n        if (i != par) {\n            this.count++;\n            if (dfs(i, child) == cycle) return cycle;\n        }\n    }\n    return path;\n}\n\nThe variables path and cycle are constants (0 and 1 in the code? Wait, in the Java code, path is 0, cycle is 1. So the function returns 1 (cycle) if a cycle is found, else 0 (path). The count is incremented each time a non-parent node is visited. The purpose is to detect cycles and count the number of edges in the path? Or perhaps the count is the number of edges in the cycle?\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program:\n\nIn the main, for each unvisited node i, they call dfs(i,0). The count is set to 0 before each call. The dfs function returns cycle (1) if a cycle is found. The count is the number of edges traversed in the path leading to the cycle? Or perhaps the number of edges in the path?\n\nWait, the count is incremented each time a child is not the parent. So for each edge except the parent, count increases. So for a tree, the count would be the number of edges in the tree (since each node except root has one parent, so each edge is counted once). But in a cycle, when a node is revisited, the count would be the number of edges until the cycle is detected.\n\nThe main logic is that if the DFS returns cycle (1), then if the count is odd, toremove is incremented. The total toremove is the number of cycles with odd length? Or perhaps the number of cycles with odd edges?\n\nWait, the problem is from Codeforces 216B, which is about counting the number of cycles with odd length in a graph, and then determining the minimal number of edges to remove to make the graph bipartite. The solution involves counting the number of odd-length cycles, and then the required edges to remove is the number of such cycles plus 1 if the total nodes minus that is odd.\n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is that each connected component that has a cycle (so it's not a tree) contributes 1 if the cycle length is odd. The total toremove is the number of such components with odd cycles, and then adjust if needed.\n\nAnyway, the code's logic is to process each connected component. For each component, if it has a cycle (the DFS returns cycle), then check if the count (number of edges in the path?) is odd. If so, toremove increases by 1. Then, if (m - toremove) is odd, add 1 to toremove.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nFirst, representing the graph. Let's think of using an adjacency list. Since nodes are numbered from 1 to m, we can have an array of lists. In Fortran, perhaps using a list of edges for each node. Since the edges are undirected, each edge is stored in both nodes' lists.\n\nWe can read all edges first, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nThen, for each node not yet visited, perform a DFS to check for cycles and count edges.\n\nImplementing DFS in Fortran without recursion. Let's see:\n\nThe DFS function in Java is recursive. To avoid recursion, we can use a stack-based approach.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran allows recursion, but for large m it might hit stack limits. But given that the problem's constraints are not specified, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to code the DFS as a recursive function in Fortran.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be recursive. So let's see.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- m is the number of nodes.\n\n- n is the number of edges (but since each edge is added twice, the total edges stored are 2n).\n\n- The adjacency list: perhaps an array of linked lists. But in Fortran, perhaps using an array of dynamic arrays. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges per node can be up to m-1, but for simplicity, perhaps read all edges first, then store them in a list for each node.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a list of edges for each node. Let's use a 2D array where for each node, we have a list of its neighbors.\n\nWait, in Fortran, perhaps using an array of linked lists is tricky. Maybe better to use a list of edges stored in a 1D array, with a pointer for each node to the start of its edges. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the nodes are numbered from 1 to m, we can pre-allocate an array for each node's edges. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have an array of size m+1 (since nodes are 1-based), each element is a list. To handle this in Fortran, perhaps using a dynamic array approach with allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nRead all edges first, then for each node, store its neighbors in an array.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Read m and n.\n\n2. Read n pairs of x and y, and for each, add y to x's list and x to y's list.\n\n3. Initialize seen array (logical array of size m+1).\n\n4. Initialize toremove =0.\n\n5. For each node i from 1 to m:\n\n   if not seen(i):\n\n      reset count to 0.\n\n      call dfs(i, 0) (parent is 0 initially).\n\n      if the result is cycle (1):\n\n          if count mod 2 ==1, then toremove +=1\n\n6. Then adjust toremove as per (m - toremove) mod 2.\n\n7. The result of this first part is toremove.\n\nNow, the DFS function in Fortran:\n\nThe function needs to return 0 (path) or 1 (cycle). It also needs to track the count.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't modify variables outside their scope unless they are passed by reference. So perhaps the count and seen arrays need to be module variables or passed as arguments.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a single program, perhaps using a module or just using global variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure the code with subroutines.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nProgram main\n\n   Read input for first part (m, n, edges).\n\n   Build adjacency lists.\n\n   Compute toremove via DFS.\n\n   Convert toremove to a string (as the input to the second step).\n\n   Process that string through the second program's logic.\n\n   Take the result (integer B), convert to string, process third step.\n\n   Output the final character.\n\nEnd program\n\nNow, the first part's DFS:\n\nWe can write a recursive subroutine for DFS.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- graph: adjacency lists. Let's represent as an array of lists. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic lists, perhaps using an array of pointers to lists. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges per node can be up to m (but m can be large?), perhaps better to use a list of edges stored in a 1D array with a pointer for each node.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, let's use a 2D array where each row is a node's neighbors. But the size would be m x max_edges, which may be too big. Alternatively, use linked lists via pointers. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a list of edges for each node stored in a 1D array, with an array indicating the start index for each node's edges.\n\nLet me think of this approach:\n\nWe can have an array 'edges' that contains all the neighbor nodes, and an array 'edgeptr' where edgeptr(i) is the starting index in edges for node i's neighbors. The number of edges for node i is edgeptr(i+1) - edgeptr(i).\n\nThis way, for each node i, its neighbors are edges(edgeptr(i)+1 : edgeptr(i+1)).\n\nTo build this:\n\nInitialize edgeptr(1) = 1.\n\nFor each edge (x,y), we add y to x's list and x to y's list. So for each edge, we need to append to both nodes' lists.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So first, we need to know the total number of edges (2n), so we can allocate edges array of size 2n.\n\nWait, but n is the number of edges input, each edge is stored twice. So total edges stored is 2n.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead m and n.\n\nAllocate edges array of size 2n.\n\nInitialize edgeptr array of size m+2 (since nodes are 1-based, edgeptr(1) is first element, edgeptr(m+1) is after last element).\n\nInitialize edgeptr(1) = 1.\n\nThen, for each of the n edges:\n\n   read x and y.\n\n   append y to x's list:\n\n      edges(edgeptr(x)) = y\n\n      edgeptr(x) = edgeptr(x) +1\n\n   append x to y's list:\n\n      edges(edgeptr(y)) = x\n\n      edgeptr(y) = edgeptr(y) +1\n\nWait, but this requires that edgeptr is being updated as we go. Hmm, perhaps better to first count the number of edges per node, then allocate the edges array properly.\n\nAlternatively, first read all edges, store them in a temporary array, then build the edgeptr and edges arrays.\n\nLet me think of this approach:\n\nRead all edges first into a temporary array.\n\nThen, for each node, count the number of edges (degree).\n\nThen, allocate edges array of size total edges (2n).\n\nThen, compute edgeptr array where edgeptr(i) is the starting index for node i's edges.\n\nedgeptr(1) = 1\n\nfor i from 2 to m+1:\n\n   edgeptr(i) = edgeptr(i-1) + degree(i-1)\n\nThen, fill the edges array by going through each edge and adding to the appropriate positions.\n\nThis way, the edges are stored in order.\n\nBut this requires two passes over the edges.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read m and n.\n\nThen, read n pairs of x and y, storing them in a temporary array.\n\nThen, compute the degree for each node (count how many times each node appears in the edges).\n\nThen, allocate edges array of size 2n.\n\nThen, compute edgeptr array.\n\nThen, fill edges array.\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nOnce the graph is built, the DFS can proceed.\n\nNow, the DFS function:\n\nWe need a recursive function that takes current node and parent, and returns 0 or 1 (path or cycle).\n\nThe count variable is a counter that increments each time a non-parent node is visited.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the count is a member variable of the class. So in Fortran, perhaps we can have a module variable or a variable passed by reference.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a single program, we can have a variable count that is modified during the DFS.\n\nLet me outline the DFS subroutine:\n\nsubroutine dfs(node, parent, cycle_found, count)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: node, parent\n\n   logical, intent(out) :: cycle_found\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: count\n\n   logical, save :: seen(m_nodes)  ! Need to declare m_nodes as a parameter or variable.\n\n   integer :: neighbor\n\n   if (seen(node)) then\n\n      cycle_found = .true.\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\n   seen(node) = .true.\n\n   cycle_found = .false.\n\n   do i = edgeptr(node), edgeptr(node+1)-1\n\n      neighbor = edges(i)\n\n      if (neighbor /= parent) then\n\n         count = count +1\n\n         call dfs(neighbor, node, is_cycle, count)\n\n         if (is_cycle) then\n\n            cycle_found = .true.\n\n            return\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   cycle_found = .false.\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but this is a rough sketch. The variables need to be properly declared. Also, the seen array must be accessible in the subroutine. Since in Fortran, variables can be module variables or passed as arguments.\n\nAlternatively, since this is part of the main program, perhaps using a module or using common blocks.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure the code with all variables in the main program.\n\nWait, perhaps the following structure:\n\nIn the main program:\n\n- Read m and n.\n\n- Read all edges into a temporary array.\n\n- Build the edgeptr and edges arrays as described.\n\n- Initialize seen array (logical, size m+1).\n\n- Initialize toremove =0.\n\n- For each node from 1 to m:\n\n   if not seen(node):\n\n      count =0\n\n      call dfs(node, 0, is_cycle)\n\n      if (is_cycle) then\n\n         if mod(count,2) ==1 then\n\n            toremove = toremove +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\nWait, but the DFS needs to return whether a cycle was found and the count.\n\nHmm, the count is a variable that is modified during the DFS. So the DFS subroutine must have access to it.\n\nAlternatively, the count can be a variable in the main program, and the DFS subroutine can modify it.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if a variable is declared in the main program, a subroutine can access it if it is in a common block or if it is passed as an argument.\n\nAlternatively, let's make the count a variable in the main program, and pass it by reference to the DFS.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nThe main program has variables:\n\ninteger :: m, n, toremove, edges(2*n), edgeptr(m+1)\n\nlogical :: seen(m+1)\n\nThen, the DFS is a recursive function that takes node and parent, and returns a logical (cycle found?), and modifies the count.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can return a value and also have intent(out) variables.\n\nAlternatively, the DFS can be a subroutine that returns a logical (cycle found) and has an intent(inout) count.\n\nSo:\n\nsubroutine dfs(node, parent, cycle_found, count)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: node, parent\n\n   logical, intent(out) :: cycle_found\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: count\n\n   integer :: neighbor, i\n\n   if (seen(node)) then\n\n      cycle_found = .true.\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\n   seen(node) = .true.\n\n   cycle_found = .false.\n\n   do i = edgeptr(node), edgeptr(node+1)-1\n\n      neighbor = edges(i)\n\n      if (neighbor /= parent) then\n\n         count = count +1\n\n         call dfs(neighbor, node, is_cycle, count)\n\n         if (is_cycle) then\n\n            cycle_found = .true.\n\n            return\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but this is missing the loop over the neighbors. Let me correct:\n\nInside the do loop over the edges of the current node:\n\nWait, the edges for node are from edgeptr(node) to edgeptr(node+1)-1.\n\nSo the loop should be:\n\ndo i = edgeptr(node), edgeptr(node+1)-1\n\n   neighbor = edges(i)\n\n   if (neighbor /= parent) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      call dfs(neighbor, node, is_cycle, count)\n\n      if (is_cycle) then\n\n         cycle_found = .true.\n\n         return\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the count is incremented for each non-parent neighbor. So in the code above, each time a neighbor is not the parent, count increases by 1, then proceed to dfs.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the base case: when the node is already seen, then it's a cycle, so return true.\n\nNow, in the main program:\n\nFor each node i from 1 to m:\n\n   if not seen(i):\n\n      count =0\n\n      call dfs(i, 0, is_cycle, count)\n\n      if (is_cycle) then\n\n         if mod(count,2) ==1 then\n\n            toremove = toremove +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\nWait, but the 'is_cycle' is set to true only if a cycle was found in the subtree. However, in the Java code, the 'cycle' is returned only if during the traversal, a node is revisited (i.e., seen is true). So the 'is_cycle' here would be true if any cycle was found in the subtree.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the function returns cycle (1) if any of the recursive calls returns cycle, or if the current node is already seen (which would mean a cycle). So the logic is correct.\n\nNow, after processing all nodes, compute toremove as per the Java code:\n\nif ( (m - toremove) %2 ==1 ) then\n\n   toremove = toremove +1\n\nend if\n\nThen, the first part's output is toremove.\n\nNow, moving to the second part (the second Java program's logic).\n\nThe second program takes a string (the output of the first program, which is the integer toremove as a string). The program processes this string to find the minimal number of changes needed to make no two consecutive characters the same. The two approaches are:\n\n1. Iterate from left to right, changing the current character if it's the same as previous.\n\n2. Iterate from right to left, changing the previous character if same as next.\n\nThe minimal of the two counts is the output.\n\nIn Fortran, the input string is the string representation of toremove. So first, we need to convert the integer toremove to a string. Let's say in Fortran, we can use write to a string.\n\nThen, process the string as per the second program's logic.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the second part:\n\nstring = trim(adjustl(toString(toremove)))  ! Convert integer to string.\n\na1 = process_forward(string)\n\na2 = process_backward(string)\n\nresult_second = min(a1, a2)\n\nThe functions process_forward and process_backward:\n\nFunction process_forward(s) result(count)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   integer :: count =0\n\n   character(len=len(s)) :: temp = s\n\n   do i=2, len(s)\n\n      if (temp(i) == temp(i-1)) then\n\n         if (temp(i) == '1') then\n\n            temp(i) = '0'\n\n         else\n\n            temp(i) = '1'\n\n         end if\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nSimilarly, process_backward:\n\nfunction process_backward(s) result(count)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   integer :: count =0\n\n   character(len=len(s)) :: temp = s\n\n   do i = len(s)-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (temp(i) == temp(i+1)) then\n\n         if (temp(i) == '1') then\n\n            temp(i) = '0'\n\n         else\n\n            temp(i) = '1'\n\n         end if\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nWait, in the Java code for the second program, the backward processing is done by checking from the end, and changing the previous character (i-1) if it's the same as current. Wait, let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code's solve method:\n\nThe a2 part:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, so in the backward pass, they check if current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, they change the previous (i-1) to the opposite. So the loop is from the end to the start, and for each position i (starting from the end), check i and i-1. If same, change i-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the backward processing would be:\n\ndo i = len(s) downto 2\n\n   if (temp(i) == temp(i-1)) then\n\n      if (temp(i-1) == '1') then\n\n         temp(i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n         temp(i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo the backward function is:\n\nfunction process_backward(s) result(count)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   integer :: count =0\n\n   character(len=len(s)) :: temp = s\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   do i = len(temp), 2, -1\n\n      if (temp(i) == temp(i-1)) then\n\n         if (temp(i-1) == '1') then\n\n            temp(i-1) = '0'\n\n         else\n\n            temp(i-1) = '1'\n\n         end if\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nThus, the second part's result is the minimum of the two counts.\n\nNow, the third program's input is the result of the second part (the integer B). The third program takes that number as a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs it.\n\nIn Fortran, the third part's input is the string representation of B. So we need to convert B to a string, then take the first character, add 1, and output it.\n\nFor example, if B is 3, the string is \"3\", first character is '3' (ASCII 51), adding 1 gives 52 which is '4'.\n\nIf B is 0, then '0' becomes '1'.\n\nIf B is 9, then '9' becomes ':', but perhaps the problem expects it to wrap? The original code in Java would just add 1, so '9' becomes ':', but maybe the problem expects numbers only. However, the third program's code is as written.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nstring_third = trim(adjustl(toString(result_second)))\n\noutput_char = char(ichar(string_third(1:1)) +1)\n\nprint *, output_char\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process through all three steps, and output the final character.\n\nNow, handling the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read m and n, then n pairs of integers. The edges are stored in the edges array and edgeptr array.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays have to be declared with fixed sizes. Since m can be up to, say, 1e5? But the problem's constraints are not given. However, since the user provided code uses Java with LinkedLists, perhaps m can be up to 1e5 or more. But in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated.\n\nThus, the steps in code:\n\nRead m and n.\n\nAllocate edges array of size 2*n.\n\nRead the n edges into a temporary array.\n\nCompute edgeptr array.\n\nBuild edges and edgeptr arrays.\n\nThen perform the DFS to compute toremove.\n\nThen proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: m, n, x, y, i, toremove, result_second, B, count, is_cycle\n\n   integer, allocatable :: edges(:), edgeptr(:)\n\n   logical, allocatable :: seen(:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: str_toremove, str_B, output_char\n\n   ! Read first part's input\n\n   read*, m, n\n\n   allocate(edges(2*n), edgeptr(m+2), seen(m+1))\n\n   edgeptr = 0\n\n   ! First, read all edges into a temporary array\n\n   integer, allocatable :: temp_edges(:,:)\n\n   allocate(temp_edges(2, n))\n\n   do i=1, n\n\n      read*, temp_edges(1,i), temp_edges(2,i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now compute edgeptr and edges arrays\n\n   ! First, count the number of edges per node\n\n   integer :: degree(m+1)\n\n   degree = 0\n\n   do i=1, n\n\n      degree(temp_edges(1,i)) = degree(temp_edges(1,i)) +1\n\n      degree(temp_edges(2,i)) = degree(temp_edges(2,i)) +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Compute edgeptr array\n\n   edgeptr(1) = 1\n\n   do i=2, m+1\n\n      edgeptr(i) = edgeptr(i-1) + degree(i-1)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now fill edges array\n\n   integer :: ptr =1\n\n   do i=1, m\n\n      do j=1, degree(i)\n\n         edges(edgeptr(i)+j-1) = ?\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nWait, this approach is getting complicated. Maybe better to read each edge and append to both nodes' lists.\n\nAlternative approach without precomputing:\n\nAllocate edges array of size 2*n.\n\nedgeptr array is of size m+2, initialized to 1, then for each node, edgeptr(i) is the current position.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nInitialize edgeptr(1) =1\n\nThen, for each edge (x,y):\n\n   append y to x's list:\n\n      edges(edgeptr(x)) = y\n\n      edgeptr(x) = edgeptr(x)+1\n\n   append x to y's list:\n\n      edges(edgeptr(y)) = x\n\n      edgeptr(y) = edgeptr(y)+1\n\nBut to do this, we need to track edgeptr for each node as we go.\n\nBut in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, perhaps:\n\nInitialize edgeptr array to 1 for all nodes.\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nInitialize edgeptr(1) =1, and edgeptr(2) to edgeptr(m+1) are initially 1?\n\nNo, better to initialize edgeptr as follows:\n\nedgeptr(1) =1\n\nedgeptr(2) =1\n\n...\n\nedgeptr(m+1) =1\n\nThen, for each edge (x,y):\n\n   edges(edgeptr(x)) = y\n\n   edgeptr(x) = edgeptr(x)+1\n\n   edges(edgeptr(y)) =x\n\n   edgeptr(y) = edgeptr(y)+1\n\nBut this would require that edgeptr is initialized to 1 for all nodes, and then after processing all edges, the edgeptr array will have the current position for each node.\n\nHowever, the edgeptr array needs to be properly ordered. Wait, but this approach would not track the correct positions. Because when we process edges in any order, the edgeptr for each node increments as edges are added. But the edgeptr array needs to store the starting index for each node's edges.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach won't work because the edgeptr array is being modified as we go, and the edges are stored in the order they are read, but the edgeptr array's values are not properly set.\n\nAlternative idea: use a temporary array to track the current position for each node.\n\nInitialize edgeptr array to 1 for all nodes.\n\nAlso, have a pointer array, say, current_edge(m+1), initialized to 1 for each node.\n\nThen, for each edge (x,y):\n\n   edges(current_edge(x)) = y\n\n   current_edge(x) = current_edge(x)+1\n\n   edges(current_edge(y)) =x\n\n   current_edge(y) = current_edge(y)+1\n\nBut then, after processing all edges, the edgeptr array can be computed as:\n\nedgeptr(1) =1\n\nfor i from 2 to m+1:\n\n   edgeptr(i) = edgeptr(i-1) + (current_edge(i-1) -1 - edgeptr(i-1) +1 ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the best way is to read all edges first into a temporary array, then build the edgeptr and edges arrays properly.\n\nLet me try this approach again.\n\nFirst, read all edges into a temporary array:\n\nallocate temp_edges(2, n)\n\nthen, for each edge, store x and y.\n\nThen, compute for each node the degree (number of edges connected to it).\n\nThen, compute edgeptr array:\n\nedgeptr(1) =1\n\nfor i from 2 to m+1:\n\n   edgeptr(i) = edgeptr(i-1) + degree(i-1)\n\nThen, allocate edges array of size edgeptr(m+1) -1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we can allocate edges as edges(edgeptr(m+1)-1).\n\nBut since we know the total edges is 2n, we can pre-allocate edges(2*n).\n\nThen, fill the edges array by going through each edge and appending to the appropriate nodes.\n\nWait, here's the step-by-step:\n\nAfter reading all edges into temp_edges(1,i) and temp_edges(2,i):\n\nInitialize edgeptr array:\n\nedgeptr(1) =1\n\ndo i=2 to m+1:\n\n   edgeptr(i) = edgeptr(i-1) + degree(i-1)\n\nend do\n\nThen, for each node x from 1 to m:\n\n   the edges for x are stored from edgeptr(x) to edgeptr(x+1)-1.\n\nNow, to fill the edges array:\n\nWe need to loop through each edge and add both directions.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ndo i=1 to n:\n\n   x = temp_edges(1,i)\n\n   y = temp_edges(2,i)\n\n   ! Add y to x's list:\n\n   pos = edgeptr(x)\n\n   edges(pos) = y\n\n   edgeptr(x) = edgeptr(x)+1  ! Wait, but edgeptr is already computed. This would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working. Maybe the edgeptr array is not the right way.\n\nAlternative idea: use a list for each node's edges, stored in a 2D array where each row is a node's edges. But since the maximum number of edges per node can be up to m, but m can be large, this may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array approach with pointers. But in Fortran, this is not straightforward.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way is to use a linked list approach with pointers, but that's complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the DFS only needs to iterate over the edges of a node, perhaps we can process the edges on the fly.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nInstead of building an adjacency list, for each edge, store them in a list, and for each node, have a list of its edges. But in Fortran, perhaps using a list of edges for each node stored in a 1D array with pointers.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to proceed with the first approach, even if it's a bit involved.\n\nLet me try to code the first part step by step.\n\nFirst, read m and n.\n\nThen read all edges into a temporary array.\n\nThen compute the degree for each node.\n\nThen compute edgeptr array.\n\nThen allocate edges array of size edgeptr(m+1) -1.\n\nThen fill edges array by iterating over each edge and adding to both nodes' lists.\n\nWait, but how to fill the edges array correctly?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter computing edgeptr array, which gives the starting index for each node's edges.\n\nFor each edge (x,y):\n\n   we need to add y to x's list and x to y's list.\n\n   The position for x's list is edgeptr(x) to edgeptr(x+1)-1.\n\n   So for x's list, the next available position is edgeptr(x) + current count for x.\n\nWait, perhaps this is not the right way. Maybe the edgeptr array is the starting index for each node's edges, and the edges are stored in order.\n\nThus, to fill the edges array:\n\nWe need to loop through each edge and add both directions.\n\nBut how to track where to place them?\n\nAlternatively, for each edge (x,y):\n\n   the first occurrence of y in x's edges is at position edgeptr(x) + current count for x.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use a different approach for the adjacency list.\n\nAlternative idea: for each node, store its edges in a list, using a dynamic array. In Fortran, this can be done with allocatable arrays.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nWe can have an array of pointers to each node's edges.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps using an array of allocatable arrays.\n\nSo:\n\ntype edge_list\n\n   integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\n\nend type\n\ntype(edge_list), allocatable :: adj(:)\n\nallocate(adj(m))\n\nThen, for each edge (x,y):\n\n   allocate a temporary array for adj(x)%edges, append y.\n\n   same for adj(y)%edges.\n\nBut in Fortran, appending to an array requires reallocation, which can be done with:\n\ninteger :: new_size\n\nnew_size = size(adj(x)%edges) +1\n\ncall move_alloc(from=adj(x)%edges, to= temp)\n\nallocate(adj(x)%edges(new_size))\n\nadj(x)%edges(1:new_size-1) = temp\n\nadj(x)%edges(new_size) = y\n\nBut this is manageable.\n\nThis approach might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me outline this:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: m, n, x, y, i, toremove, result_second, B, count, is_cycle\n\n   type edge_list\n\n      integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\n\n   end type\n\n   type(edge_list), allocatable :: adj(:)\n\n   logical, allocatable :: seen(:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: str_toremove, str_B, output_char\n\n   !

However, in the current code, the 'count' is a variable in the main program, but the DFS subroutine is in a contained module, so it can access variables from the main program.\n\nWait, in the code above, the 'count' variable in the main program is being modified by the DFS subroutine. But in the DFS subroutine, the 'count' is not passed as an argument. So this may not work.\n\nAh, right. The count variable in the main program is not accessible in the DFS subroutine unless it is declared in a common block or passed as an argument.\n\nThis is a problem. So the DFS subroutine needs to have access to the count variable.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps pass count as an argument to the DFS subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, make count a module variable.\n\nAlternatively, in the contained DFS subroutine, we can have an argument for count.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nIn the main program:\n\n   integer :: count\n\nInside the loop over nodes:\n\n      count =0\n\n      call dfs(i, 0, is_cycle, count)\n\nThen, the DFS subroutine:\n\n   recursive subroutine dfs(node, parent, is_cycle, count)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: node, parent\n\n      logical, intent(out) :: is_cycle\n\n      integer, intent(inout) :: count\n\n      integer :: neighbor\n\n      integer :: i\n\n      logical :: found_cycle\n\n      is_cycle = .false.\n\n      if (seen(node)) then\n\n         is_cycle = .true.\n\n         return\n\n      end if\n\n      seen(node) = .true.\n\n      do i=1, size(adj(node)%edges)\n\n         neighbor = adj(node)%edges(i)\n\n         if (neighbor /= parent) then\n\n            count = count +1\n\n            call dfs(neighbor, node, found_cycle, count)\n\n            if (found_cycle) then\n\n               is_cycle = .true.\n\n               return\n\n            end if\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end subroutine\n\nThis way, the count is passed into the DFS and modified.\n\nNow, the main program's loop:\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n   if (.not. seen(i)) then\n\n      count =0\n\n      call dfs(i, 0, is_cycle, count)\n\n      if (is_cycle) then\n\n         if (mod(count,2) ==1) then\n\n            toremove = toremove +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis should work.\n\nAnother issue: the 'seen' array must be reinitialized for each run of the DFS. Wait, no, in the main program, the seen array is initialized to .false. before starting the loop. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the 'adj' array is allocated from 1 to m+1? Or 1 to m?\n\nIn the code above, the nodes are numbered from 1 to m, so adj should be allocated as m elements. The code says allocate(adj(m+1)), which may be incorrect. It should be allocate(adj(m)).\n\nAlso, in the add_edge subroutine, when adding to adj(x), x can be up to m, so the allocation should be for m nodes.\n\nSo correcting that:\n\nallocate(adj(m))\n\nThen, in the loop over edges:\n\nread*, x, y\n\ncall add_edge(adj(x), y)\n\ncall add_edge(adj(y), x)\n\nNow, the nodes are 1-based up to m.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the DFS, the 'parent' is passed as 0 initially. But in the Java code, the parent is 0 for the root node. Since nodes are numbered from 1 to m, this is okay.\n\nNow, the 'seen' array is of size m+1, but nodes are 1-based to m. So seen(1) to seen(m) are used, and seen(0) is unused. That's okay.\n\nNow, the process_forward and process_backward functions are contained in the program, so they can be called.\n\nNow, the third part's processing:\n\nThe result_second is the minimal count from the second part. We need to convert it to a string, then take the first character.\n\nIn the code:\n\nwrite(str_B, '(i0)') result_second\n\nstr_B = adjustl(str_B)\n\nThen, the first character is str_B(1:1). If the string is empty (e.g., result_second is 0?), but since result_second is the minimal of two counts, which can be zero, but the string would be \"0\".\n\nThus, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs toremove =5, then the second program's input is \"5\", which is length 1. The second program's output is the minimal between processing forward and backward.\n\nProcessing \"5\" (single character) gives a1=0 and a2=0, so result_second=0. Then the third program's input is \"0\", so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nAnother case: toremove=3, second program's input is \"3\". The minimal count is 0, so result_second=0. Third outputs '1'.\n\nIf the second program's result is 9, then third outputs ':'.\n\nBut the code should handle it as per the original Java.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the DFS, the 'count' is incremented for each non-parent neighbor. The count represents the number of edges traversed in the path leading to a cycle. The Java code's count is the number of edges in the path, which for a cycle would be the length of the cycle minus 1? Or the total edges in the path?\n\nThe Java code increments count for each non-parent edge. So for a tree, the count would be the number of edges in the tree (since each node except root has one parent, so each edge is counted once). For a cycle, when a back edge is found, the count would be the number of edges taken to reach the cycle.\n\nThe key is that the count is the number of edges in the path from the root to the current node, excluding the parent edge. So for a cycle, the count would be the length of the path from the root to the node where the cycle is detected, plus the back edge.\n\nBut the code checks if the count is odd. So the cycle's length must be odd.\n\nWait, the cycle length is (count +1) ? Because the path from the root to the current node is count edges, and the back edge forms the cycle, so the cycle length is count +1 (the path plus the back edge).\n\nThus, if the count is even, then the cycle length is odd, and vice versa.\n\nWait, the code in Java says:\n\nif (count %2 ==1) then toremove +=1.\n\nWait, the count is the number of edges in the path leading to the cycle. The cycle length is count +1 (since the back edge forms the cycle). So if count is even, then the cycle length is odd, so the condition is count mod 2 ==1 would be incorrect.\n\nWait, this suggests a possible error in the code.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a cycle of length 3 (odd). The path from the root to the node where the cycle is detected would have count = 2 (edges), so count mod 2 is 0. Thus, the code would not increment toremove, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, this indicates a possible mistake in the code's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the code's variables.\n\nLooking back at the Java code:\n\nIn the first Java program's DFS function:\n\nThe count is incremented for each non-parent edge. So for a cycle, when the node is revisited (seen is true), the count is the number of edges taken to reach that node from the root, excluding the parent edge. The cycle length is the current count plus 1 (the back edge).\n\nThus, the cycle length is count +1.\n\nThe code checks if count is odd. So if the cycle length is even (count+1 even \u2192 count odd), then it would be counted. Wait, no:\n\nIf cycle length is odd \u2192 count+1 is odd \u2192 count is even \u2192 the code would not count it.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (count %2 ==1) then toremove +=1.\n\nBut if the cycle length is odd \u2192 count+1 is odd \u2192 count is even \u2192 the condition is false.\n\nThus, the code would not count it, which is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the code.\n\nWait, the code's toremove is incremented when the cycle is found and the count is odd.\n\nBut the count is the number of edges in the path leading to the cycle.\n\nThe cycle length is count +1 (since the back edge forms the cycle).\n\nThus, if the cycle length is odd \u2192 count+1 is odd \u2192 count is even \u2192 the code does not increment toremove.\n\nBut the problem requires counting cycles with odd length.\n\nThus, the code's condition is wrong.\n\nThis indicates that the original Java code may have a bug, but since the user provided it, I must translate it as is.\n\nThe code's logic is to increment toremove when the cycle is found and count is odd. So even if the cycle length is even, it would be counted.\n\nThis suggests that the code may have a mistake, but since I'm to translate it as given, I must proceed with the code as written.\n\nThus, the Fortran code must follow the same logic.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct as per the provided Java code.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code should be as outlined above, with the corrections made.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the DFS subroutine, the 'count' is passed as an argument, but in the main program, the 'count' variable is declared in the main program. However, in the code above, the 'count' in the main program is shadowed by the 'count' in the loop.\n\nWait, in the main program:\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n   if (.not. seen(i)) then\n\n      count =0\n\n      call dfs(i, 0, is_cycle, count)\n\n      ...\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThe 'count' here is the same variable declared in the main program. So that's okay.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, compiling all the pieces into the final Fortran program."
