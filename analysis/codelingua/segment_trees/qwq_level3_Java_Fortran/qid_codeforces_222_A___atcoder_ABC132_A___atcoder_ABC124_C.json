In Fortran, the variables l and c can be initialized as l = 0, c =1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_222_A) reads some integers from input. It takes n, k, then a list of n numbers. It checks consecutive duplicates and calculates some condition with c and k. The output is either n - c or -1. So the output of this is a single integer, which will be the input for the next program.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. Outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". The input here would be the output from the first program. Wait, but the first program outputs a number. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the first program's output is a number, but the second program expects a string. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first program outputs a number. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code: the first program's output is either n - c or -1, which is an integer. The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is a number, which would be passed as a string to the second program. For example, if the first outputs 4, then the second would read \"4\" as the input string. Then the second program checks if that string has exactly two different characters each appearing twice. Wait, but \"4\" is a single character, so the second would output \"No\". Hmm, but maybe the actual input for the second program is different. Wait, perhaps the sequence is that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string? Wait, no, the first program's output is a number, so when passed to the second program, it's the string representation of that number. So the second program will process that string. Then the second program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string, which is then the input to the third program. The third program expects a string input (the third Java program's input is a string, like \"0101\" or something). Wait, the third Java program's code shows that it reads a string via in.next(), so the input is a string. So the second program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a two-character string (or three for \"Yes\"), but the third program expects a string input. Wait, but the third program's input is a string, so the second's output must be the input to the third. So the third program would read \"Yes\" or \"No\" as its input. But the third program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of 0s and 1s, perhaps? Let me check the third Java code.\n\nLooking at the third Java program (atcoder_ABC124_C), it reads a string x, then processes it to find the minimum number of changes needed to make consecutive characters different, either by changing forward or backward. The output is the minimum between two methods. So the input to the third program must be a string of 0s and 1s. But the second program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are not 0/1 strings. That suggests that perhaps the sequence of programs is not correctly connected? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem's setup. Wait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which is a number (integer) written as a string. The second program then processes that string (the number as a string) and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then the third program takes that \"Yes\" or \"No\" as input, but that's not a valid input for the third program's problem. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Alternatively, maybe the three Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are not directly connected? Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the third program expects a string of 0s and 1s, but the second's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is not that. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user provided the wrong code? Or maybe I need to proceed as per the code given, even if the sequence seems inconsistent. Let me proceed as per the code given, assuming that the sequence is correct, and the programs are connected as described.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is passed as a string to the second program. The second program checks if that string has exactly two different characters each appearing twice. For example, if the first program outputs 12, then the string is \"12\", which has two characters, each appearing once. So the second would output \"No\". If the first outputs 1122, then the string is \"1122\", which has two characters each appearing twice, so \"Yes\". Then the third program takes that \"Yes\" or \"No\" as input, but the third program's code expects a string of 0s and 1s. So \"Yes\" is \"Y\", \"e\", \"s\" which are not 0/1. So this would be invalid. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the code sequence? Or maybe the actual problem is different. Alternatively, maybe the three Java programs are not supposed to be connected in sequence, but the user wants each to be translated into a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence. Wait, the user says \"the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". So the three Java programs are run in sequence, with each's output as next's input. So the first's output is the second's input, second's output is third's input. The final output is the third's output. So the Fortran program must read the first's input, process through all three steps, and output the third's result. So the Fortran program must read the first's input (the input to the first Java program), then process through all three steps without I/O in between, and output the third's result.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, k, then n integers).\n\n2. Process the first Java's logic to get its output (integer).\n\n3. Use that integer as the input to the second Java's logic (treat it as a string).\n\n4. Process the second Java's logic to get its output (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n5. Use that string as the input to the third Java's logic (the third expects a string, so the input is the \"Yes\" or \"No\" string).\n\n6. Process the third's logic and output its result (the minimum between a1 and a2).\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a string of 0s and 1s. So if the second program outputs \"Yes\", then the third program would process \"Yes\", which is not 0/1. That would be invalid. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the three programs are separate and not connected? But the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the code provided is correct, and I have to proceed as per the code given, even if the sequence is logically inconsistent. Maybe the second program's output is a string that can be processed by the third. Let me see the third program's code again.\n\nLooking at the third Java program's code:\n\nThe third program reads a string x via in.next(). Then it processes it to find the minimal number of changes needed to make consecutive characters different. The input is a string of characters (probably 0 and 1, but the code doesn't restrict it). The code uses '0' and '1' in the processing. So if the input is \"Yes\", then the code would process each character, but since they are not 0 or 1, the code would still run but the result might be nonsensical. However, according to the problem's instruction, the Fortran program must behave identically to the original chain. So even if the input is invalid for the third program, the code must process it as per the Java code.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the given code, the steps are:\n\nFirst program's output is an integer (let's say 123). The second program takes that as a string \"123\", checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. Since \"123\" has three characters, each once, it would output \"No\". Then the third program takes \"No\" as input, which is two characters. The third program would process \"N\" and \"o\", but since they are not 0 or 1, the code would still run. The first loop in the third program's solve method:\n\nFor the first loop (forward):\n\nStarting with the string \"No\".\n\nCheck index 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The Java code uses x.length() which is the length. Let's see: in the first loop, for i from 1 to x.length()-1 (since in Java, indices start at 0, so for i=1 to x.length()-1). The code checks if current char equals previous. For \"N\" and \"o\", they are different, so no change. So a1 remains 0. Then the second loop (backward):\n\nLoop from i = x.length()-1 down to 1. Again, comparing each to previous. Since they are different, no changes. So a1 and a2 are 0, so the output is 0. So the third program would output 0 in this case.\n\nSo even if the input is \"No\", the code would process it as per the code's logic, even if it's not 0/1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence, using the outputs as inputs between steps.\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first block (Java's first program) must read the input (n, k, then n integers).\n\n- The second block (Java's second program) must process the output of the first (the integer) as a string.\n\n- The third block (Java's third program) must process the output of the second (the \"Yes\" or \"No\" string) as its input.\n\n- The final output is the third program's output.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, k, then n integers).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (integer).\n\n3. Convert that integer to a string (for the second program's input).\n\n4. Process the second program's logic on that string, resulting in \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n5. Convert that string into the input for the third program.\n\n6. Process the third program's logic on that string, outputting the final result.\n\nNow, translating each Java program into Fortran steps.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (codeforces_222_A):\n\nThe first program reads n, k, then n integers. It tracks the last number (l) and a counter (c). For each a in the list, if a == l, increment c, else reset c to 1. After processing all, if c +k >n, output n -c, else -1.\n\nIn Fortran, variables can be declared. Let's see:\n\nWe need to read n, k, then n integers. Let's store the integers in an array. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: n, k, a(n), l, c, i\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with a fixed size, but since n is read first, we can use an allocatable array.\n\nAlternatively, read n, then allocate an array of size n, then read the elements.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nAllocate an array of size n.\n\nRead the n integers into the array.\n\nInitialize l to 0 (or first element?), but in Java, l starts at 0, then first a is compared to l (0). Wait, in the Java code, l is initialized to 0, and c to 1. Wait, let me check the Java code again:\n\nIn codeforces_222_A:\n\nint l =0, c=1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    int a = in.nextInt();\n\n    if (a == l) c +=1;\n\n    else c =1;\n\n    l =a;\n\n}\n\nWait, the first a is read, then check if a == l (which is 0 initially). So for the first element, if it's 0, then c becomes 2? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, l is 0, c is 1.\n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\na is the first number. Suppose it's 5.\n\nThen a != l (0), so c is set to 1. Then l becomes 5.\n\nWait, so the first element's a is compared to l (0). So the first a's value doesn't affect c unless it's 0. Hmm, perhaps the code is intended to track consecutive duplicates. Let me think: the code is counting the current run length. Because for each a, if it's same as previous (l), then c increases, else reset to 1. So the initial l is 0, which is not part of the input. So the first a's run length is 1 (since it's different from l=0). Then l becomes a, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to track the current run length. So the first element's run is 1, then next elements check if same as previous. So the initial l is 0 (a dummy value), so the first a's run is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, the variables l and c can be initialized as l = 0, c =1.\n\nThen loop over each a in the array:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    a_i = array(i)\n\n    if (a_i == l) then\n\n        c = c +1\n\n    else\n\n        c =1\n\n    end if\n\n    l = a_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is from 0 to n-1, so the first element is the first a. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the loop is from 1 to n.\n\nAfter processing all elements, check if c +k >n. If yes, output n -c, else -1.\n\nSo the first part's result is an integer, which is the output of the first program.\n\nNow, the second program (atcoder_ABC132_A):\n\nThis takes a string (the first program's output as a string), counts the frequency of each character, checks if all have exactly 2 occurrences and there are exactly two distinct characters.\n\nIn Fortran, the input is the integer from first program, converted to a string. So in Fortran, after getting the first result (integer res1), we can convert it to a string s1.\n\nThen process s1's characters.\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in s1.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see:\n\nSuppose s is the string (e.g., \"123\").\n\nWe can loop through each character, count their occurrences.\n\nWe can use a hash map, but in Fortran, there's no built-in hash map. So perhaps use an array to count, but since characters can be any, perhaps use a derived type or a dictionary-like structure. Alternatively, since the possible characters are limited (digits and maybe signs?), but in this case, the first program's output is an integer, so the string is a sequence of digits (assuming positive numbers). So the characters are '0' to '9', and possibly '-' if negative. But the first program's output is either n -c or -1. So possible outputs are numbers like 5, -1, etc. So the string can have '-', digits.\n\nWe can create an array to count each character's frequency. Let's use a character array and an integer array for counts.\n\nAlternatively, use a hash table approach with a list of characters and counts. But in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to loop through each character in the string, and for each, check if it's already in a list, increment count, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible characters are limited, we can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) to count each character's occurrence.\n\nLet me think:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len= :), allocatable :: s1\n\ninteger, dimension(256) :: counts = 0\n\ninteger :: i, c_code\n\ns1 = trim(adjustl(str(res1)))  ! assuming res1 is the first program's output, converted to string.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n\n    c_code = ichar(s1(i:i))\n\n    counts(c_code) = counts(c_code) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen check if all counts are 2 except for those not present, and exactly two characters have count 2.\n\nWait, the criteria are:\n\n- The string must have exactly two distinct characters.\n\n- Each of those two must have exactly two occurrences.\n\nSo first, count how many characters have a count of 2. Let's see:\n\ninteger :: num_2 = 0\n\ndo i = 1, 256\n\n    if (counts(i) == 2) then\n\n        num_2 = num_2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_2 == 2 .and. sum(counts) == 4) then\n\n    output \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    output \"No\"\n\nWait, because the total length must be 4 (since two characters each appearing twice). So the total length is 4, and exactly two characters with count 2 each.\n\nAlternatively, the total length is 4, and exactly two characters with count 2 each.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nsum(counts) == 4 (total characters)\n\nand the number of characters with count 2 is exactly 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (sum(counts) ==4 .and. num_2 ==2) then\n\n    result2 = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    result2 = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the original Java code checks that all entries in the map have value 2, and the map size is 2. So the same as above.\n\nThus, the second program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the third program (atcoder_ABC124_C):\n\nThis takes the string from the second program's output (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), and processes it to find the minimal number of changes needed to make consecutive characters different, using two methods (forward and backward passes).\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe first method (a1) processes the string from left to right. Whenever two consecutive characters are the same, change the current one to the opposite (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nThe second method (a2) processes from right to left. Whenever two consecutive are same, change the previous one, increment a2.\n\nThe minimal of a1 and a2 is the output.\n\nIn Fortran, the input string is s2 (the second program's output, \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nWe need to process this string.\n\nFirst, for the first method (a1):\n\nInitialize a copy of the string (a_str). Then loop from 2 to len(s2):\n\nif current character equals previous, change it to the opposite, increment a1.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') set to '0', else '1'\n\n        a1++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the first loop (a_str):\n\nStart with the original string. For each position i from 1 (Java's 0-based, so in Fortran 2-based?), need to check.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 1 to x.length()-1 (since i starts at 1 and goes up to x.length()-1, since indices are 0-based). So in Fortran, if the string is 1-based, then the loop would be from 2 to len(s2).\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nSuppose the string is stored as a character array. Let's say s is the input string (e.g., \"Yes\").\n\nIn Fortran, the characters are s(1), s(2), s(3).\n\nFirst method (a1):\n\nInitialize a_str as s.\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i =2, len(s)\n\n    if (a_str(i) == a_str(i-1)) then\n\n        if (a_str(i) == '1') then\n\n            a_str(i) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            a_str(i) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the original code, the first method changes the current character (i) if it's same as previous (i-1). So that's correct.\n\nSecond method (a2):\n\nInitialize b_str as s.\n\na2 =0\n\nloop from i = len(s) down to 2:\n\n    if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n\n        if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            b_str(i-1) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, in the Java code for the second loop:\n\nfor (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--)\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        change b[i-1], increment a2.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is from i = len(s) downto 2.\n\nThus, after processing both methods, the minimal of a1 and a2 is the output.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k, then n integers.\n\n2. Process first program's logic to get res1 (integer).\n\n3. Convert res1 to a string s1.\n\n4. Process second program's logic on s1 to get res2 (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n5. Process third program's logic on res2 to get the final result (integer).\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure:\n\nWe need to read the input for the first program, process all steps, and output the final result.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- For first program: n, k, array of integers (a_list), l, c.\n\n- For second program: s1 (string of res1), counts array, num_2, etc.\n\n- For third program: s2 (res2), a_str, b_str, a1, a2.\n\nNow, let's code step by step.\n\nFirst, read the first program's input:\n\nRead n and k, then n integers.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, k, i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a_list(:)\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(a_list(n))\n\nread*, a_list\n\nThen process first program's logic:\n\ninteger :: l, c, res1\n\nl =0\n\nc =1\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    if (a_list(i) == l) then\n\n        c = c +1\n\n    else\n\n        c =1\n\n    end if\n\n    l = a_list(i)\n\nend do\n\nif (c +k > n) then\n\n    res1 = n -c\n\nelse\n\n    res1 = -1\n\nend if\n\nNow, convert res1 to a string s1.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1\n\nwrite(s1, '(i0)') res1\n\ns1 = adjustl(s1)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nNow, process the second program's logic.\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in s1.\n\nInitialize counts array (size 256):\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: counts =0\n\ninteger :: c_code, len_s1, num_2, total\n\nlen_s1 = len_trim(s1)\n\ndo i =1, len_s1\n\n    c_code = ichar(s1(i:i))\n\n    counts(c_code) = counts(c_code) +1\n\nend do\n\nnum_2 =0\n\ntotal =0\n\ndo i=0,255\n\n    if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n        num_2 = num_2 +1\n\n    end if\n\n    total = total + counts(i)\n\nend do\n\nlogical :: ok\n\nok = .false.\n\nif (num_2 ==2 .and. total ==4) then\n\n    ok = .true.\n\nend if\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: res2\n\nif (ok) then\n\n    res2 = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    res2 = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the length of res2 must be exactly 3 for \"Yes\" and 2 for \"No\". Hmm, perhaps better to use a character(len=4) to hold \"Yes\" or \"No\" with a space or something, but in Fortran, strings can be handled with len_trim.\n\nAlternatively, use a character(len=4) and set to \"Yes \" or \"No \" to have fixed length. But perhaps better to use a character variable with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character(len=3) for \"Yes\" and \"No\" (since \"No\" is 2 characters, but in Fortran, the length is fixed, so leading/trailing spaces may be present. To avoid issues, perhaps set res2 to \"Yes\" or \"No\" with a length of 3, so \"No \" (with a space) for \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, use a character(len=4) and set to \"Yes\" or \"No\" with a trailing space. But perhaps better to use a character(len=4) and then trim when needed.\n\nAlternatively, just set res2 to \"Yes\" or \"No\" and let the length be 3 or 2, but in Fortran, when assigning, the length must match. So perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: res2\n\nif (ok) then\n\n    res2 = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    res2 = \"No \"  ! with a space to make it 3 characters\n\nend if\n\nWait, but \"No\" is two characters. To make it 3, add a space. But when processing in the third step, the third program's input is the string \"No \" (with space) or \"Yes\". But the original Java code for the second program outputs \"No\" (without space). Hmm, this could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps use a character(len=4) and set to \"Yes\" or \"No\" with a trailing space, but then in the third step, the length is adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character(len= :), allocatable string. But in Fortran, allocatable character variables can be tricky. Alternatively, use a character(len=20) and set to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nLet me adjust:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: res2\n\nif (ok) then\n\n    res2 = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n    res2 = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nThen, when passing to the third program, the length is len_trim(res2).\n\nNow, moving to the third program's processing.\n\nThe third program's input is the string res2 (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nWe need to process this string through the two methods.\n\nFirst, create copies of the string for a_str and b_str.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2, a_str, b_str\n\ns2 = trim(res2)\n\na_str = s2\n\nb_str = s2\n\ninteger :: a1 =0, a2=0\n\nlen_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n\n!

The length is len_trim(s2).\n\nBut in Fortran, when you assign a_str = s2, the entire array is copied, including trailing spaces. So when we process a_str(i:i), we need to ensure that we are only considering the characters up to len_s2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character array of length len_s2, but that complicates things. Alternatively, in the loops, we can loop up to len_s2.\n\nThe code above should handle that.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The counts array is initialized to 0 each time? Wait, in the code above, after the first program, the counts array is used for the second program. But in the code, after processing the first program, the counts array is set to 0 before processing the second program's counts. Yes, in the code:\n\ncounts =0\n\nbefore the loop over the characters of s1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second program's processing, the total is the sum of all counts, which must be equal to the length of s1. Since s1 is the string representation of res1, its length is correct.\n\nAnother point: in the third program's processing, the input is res2, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". The length of \"Yes\" is 3, \"No\" is 2. The code processes all characters in the string.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose first program outputs 12 (res1=12). Then s1 is \"12\".\n\nSecond program processes \"12\": characters '1' and '2', each count 1. So total is 2, which is not 4. So output is \"No\".\n\nThird program's input is \"No\" (len=2).\n\nProcessing a1:\n\nInitial string is \"N\",\"o\".\n\nLoop from i=2 (second character):\n\nCheck if \"o\" == \"N\"? No. So a1 remains 0.\n\na2 processing:\n\nLoop from i=2 down to 2 (only i=2):\n\nCheck if \"o\" == \"N\"? No. So a2 remains 0.\n\nThus, min(0,0) is 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs 1122 (res1=1122). s1 is \"1122\".\n\nSecond program counts:\n\n'1' appears 2 times, '2' appears 2 times. total is 4, num_2 is 2. So output \"Yes\".\n\nThird program's input is \"Yes\".\n\nProcessing a1:\n\nOriginal string is \"Y\", \"e\", \"s\".\n\nCheck i=2 (e vs Y: no change. i=3 (s vs e: no change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nProcessing a2 (backward):\n\ni=3: s vs e: no change.\n\ni=2: e vs Y: no change.\n\nThus, a1 and a2 are 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case where third program's input is \"0101\".\n\nWait, but that would be from a second program's output of \"0101\", which requires the first program's output to be 1010 (for example). But the third program would process it as per the code.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, possible issues in the code:\n\n- The counts array is dimensioned from 0 to 255. In Fortran, the ichar function returns the ASCII code, which is 0-255 for standard characters. So that's okay.\n\n- The third program's processing of characters not '0' or '1' (like 'Y', 'e', 's', 'N', 'o') will still be processed, but the code will toggle between '0' and '1' regardless. For example, if the current character is 'Y', then changing to '0' or '1' based on the previous. But the code will do that as per the Java logic.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
