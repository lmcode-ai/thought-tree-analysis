    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC145_B) reads an integer n and a string. It checks if the string is made of two copies of its first half. So, for example, if the string is \"abba\", then the first half is \"ab\", and the second half is also \"ab\", so it would output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC129_E) takes a string and computes some dynamic programming result modulo 1e9+7. The DP array is tracking two states, and the transitions depend on the current character. The final output is the sum of the two states at the end.\n\nThe third file (codeforces_49_A) reads a string and checks if the last non-space and non-question mark character is a vowel (case-insensitive). It outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's input is read from stdin, then its output is passed to the second, and so on. But in Fortran, we can't have intermediate I/O between the steps. So all the processing must be done in memory.\n\n2. The first program's output is the result of the first check (Yes/No). But wait, actually, looking at the first Java program, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which would be the input to the second program? Wait, no. Wait, the original setup is that each program's output is the input to the next. Wait, the first program's output is the result of the first check, but the second program expects a string as input. Wait, looking at the second Java program's main function, it reads a string via sc.nextLine(). So the first program's output (Yes/No) would be the input to the second program. But that can't be right because the second program expects a string that's part of the problem's input. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first Java program reads from stdin, processes, outputs to stdout. The second program takes that output as its input, processes, outputs to its stdout, which is then the input to the third program, which finally outputs the final result.\n\nWait, but looking at the first Java program's code, it reads n and then a string. The second program's input is a string (from the first's output?), but the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". That would mean the second program is getting \"Yes\" or \"No\" as input, but the second program's code expects a string that's part of the problem's input. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nWait, the first Java program's input is n and a string. The first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is a string (from the first's output?), but the second program's code is expecting a string that's part of its own problem's input. Wait, this suggests that the first program's output is the input to the second program, but that might not make sense. For example, the second program's problem (ABC129_E) probably requires a different input. So perhaps the original setup is that the first program's input is the user's input, and its output is passed to the second program's input, and so on. But the problem's description says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, with each output as the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but looking at the first Java program's code, the first program's input is n and a string. The first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is a string (from the first's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\"). But the second program's code (ABC129_E) is expecting a string that's part of its own problem's input. For example, the problem for ABC129_E might require a string of 0s and 1s, but the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is two letters. That would not make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Wait, maybe the first program's output is not the entire output, but the intermediate data is passed between them. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the result of its processing, but the second program's input is the original input's next part? No, the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program reads from stdin, processes, writes to stdout. The second program reads that stdout as its stdin, processes, writes to its stdout, which is the third's stdin, etc.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the first program's input is n and a string. The first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is that \"Yes\" or \"No\" string. But the second program's code expects a string (like a problem input) which may not be compatible. So perhaps the problem's setup is that the three Java programs are part of a pipeline where each subsequent program uses the previous's output as input, but the actual problem's input is the first's input, and the final output is the third's output. But in this case, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's code (ABC129_E) requires a string (like a binary string?), so this would not work. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the first program's output is not the only output, but the problem's setup is that the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, each taking the previous's output as input, but the actual problem's input is the first's input, and the final output is the third's output. But the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's code expects a string that's part of its own problem's input. For example, the second program's problem (ABC129_E) might require a string of digits or something else, but the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is two letters. That would not be compatible. So perhaps the problem's setup is different. Maybe the first program's output is not the only output, but the three programs are part of a sequence where each program's output is the input to the next, but the first program's input is the user's input, and the third's output is the final result. But in that case, the first program's output must be compatible with the second's input, and the second's output must be compatible with the third's input. Let me check each program's input and output.\n\nFirst program (ABC145_B):\n\nInput: n (integer) and a string (next line). The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond program (ABC129_E):\n\nInput: a string (read via nextLine()), which is the first program's output. But the second program's problem requires a string (maybe of 0s and 1s?), but the first's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". That's a problem. So perhaps the problem's setup is different. Maybe the first program's output is not the only output, but the three programs are part of a sequence where each program's output is the input to the next, but the first program's input is the user's input, and the third's output is the final result. But in this case, the first program's output must be compatible with the second's input, and the second's output must be compatible with the third's input. Let me see the third program's input.\n\nThird program (codeforces_49_A):\n\nInput: a string (read via nextLine()), which is the second program's output. The second program's output is a number (the DP result modulo 1e9+7). So the third program would read that number as a string, then check the last non-space/non-? character. But the number is a numeric string, so the last character would be a digit, which is not a vowel. So the third program would output \"NO\" unless the number ends with a vowel digit, which is impossible. So this suggests that the setup is not correct. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. Maybe the three Java programs are not to be run in sequence with their outputs as inputs, but instead, the entire sequence is to be translated into a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with the first reading input, the last producing output, and the intermediates passing data in memory. The user's instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output. So the first program's output must be a string that the second can process, and the second's output must be a string that the third can process.\n\nWait, let's look at each program's output:\n\nFirst program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond program outputs a number (the DP result mod 1e9+7). So the second's output is a numeric string, like \"12345\".\n\nThird program takes that numeric string and checks the last non-space/non-? character. Since the second's output is a number, the last character is a digit (0-9), which is not a vowel. So the third would output \"NO\".\n\nBut perhaps the problem's actual setup is that the three Java programs are part of a pipeline where each program's output is the input to the next, but the first program's input is the user's input, and the third's output is the final result. However, the way the programs are written, the first's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's code (ABC129_E) expects a string (like a problem input) which may not be compatible. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not the only output, but the three programs are part of a sequence where each program's output is the input to the next. Let me see the first program's code again:\n\nFirst program's code:\n\nIt reads n and a string. Then checks if the string is made of two copies of its first half. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond program's code:\n\nIt reads a string (from the first's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\"). Then processes it with DP. The output is a number (the DP result mod 1e9+7).\n\nThird program's code:\n\nReads the second's output (a number as a string), then checks the last non-space/non-? character. Since the number is like \"12345\", the last character is '5', which is not a vowel, so output is \"NO\".\n\nSo the final output would be \"NO\" if the first program outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", but the third program's output is \"NO\" in either case. But perhaps the actual problem's setup is different. Maybe the first program's output is not the only output, but the three programs are part of a sequence where the first's input is the user's input, and the third's output is the final result, but the intermediate steps are connected via their outputs. So the user's input is given to the first program, which produces an output that is the input to the second, which produces an output that is the input to the third, which finally outputs the result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the first program's input (n and a string), process through all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the string (from stdin).\n\n2. Process first step (check if the string is made of two copies of its first half). The output of this step is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take that output string and process it through the second step (the DP problem). The output is a number (as a string).\n\n4. Take that number string and process through the third step (check last character). Output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but the second step's input is the first's output (Yes/No). The second program's code (ABC129_E) expects a string (like a problem input). Let me see the second Java program's code again:\n\nThe second program's code reads a string via sc.nextLine(). So the input to the second program is the first's output (Yes or No). The second program's code then processes that string. Let's see what the second program does with it.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nIt reads the string s, then initializes a DP array. The DP transitions depend on the characters in s. For example, if the input string is \"Yes\", then the characters are 'Y', 'e', 's'. The DP would process each character. The final output is the sum mod 1e9+7.\n\nThen the third program takes that output (a number like 12345) as a string, and checks the last non-space/non-? character. Since the number's string has no spaces or '?', the last character is the last digit. Since digits are not vowels, the third program would output \"NO\".\n\nSo the final output is \"NO\" regardless of the first step's result. But perhaps the problem's actual setup is different. However, according to the user's instruction, I have to translate the sequence as given.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with the first reading input, the last producing output, and intermediates without I/O.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the string from stdin.\n\n2. Process first step (check if the string is made of two copies of its first half). The result is a string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take that string and process through the second step (the DP problem). The result is a number (as an integer, but in Fortran, perhaps stored as a string for passing to the third step).\n\nWait, but the second step's output is a number, which is printed as a string. The third step needs to process that string. So the second step's output is a string (the number as a string), which is passed to the third step.\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the output is System.out.println((dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M); which is an integer, printed as a string. So in Fortran, the second step's output is an integer, which we can convert to a string for the third step.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and the string (first step's input).\n\n- Compute first step's output (Yes/No).\n\n- Use that string as input to the second step's processing (the DP problem). The second step's output is the computed number (as an integer, but stored as a string for the third step).\n\n- Use that number string as input to the third step's processing (check last character).\n\n- Output the third step's result (YES/NO).\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst step:\n\nThe first step's code is straightforward. The string must be of even length (since n is the length?), wait in the first Java program, n is the input integer, and the string is read via nextLine(). Wait, in the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nn = cin.nextInt();\n\ncin.nextLine(); // consume the newline after the integer?\n\nstr = cin.nextLine();\n\nWait, so the first line after the integer is read via nextLine() (the cin.nextLine() after nextInt() is to consume the newline, perhaps). Then the next line is the string.\n\nWait, in Java, after reading an integer with nextInt(), the nextLine() would read the rest of the line (including the newline). So perhaps the code is structured to read the integer, then the next line (the actual string). So in Fortran, the input would be first an integer n, then a string (the next line).\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the string is read via cin.nextLine() after the initial nextInt(). So the first line of input is the integer n, then the next line is the string.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first step's input is:\n\nRead n from stdin, then read the next line as the string.\n\nThen check if the string is equal to a + a, where a is the first half.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead *, n\n\nRead *, str (but in Fortran, reading a string with list-directed input may not read the entire line. So perhaps better to read the entire line after n. Alternatively, use a read statement with an asterisk and adjust accordingly. Alternatively, read the entire line as a character array, but need to handle the input correctly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, to read the first line as an integer n, then the next line as the string.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nRead the first line as an integer n, then read the next line as the string.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nRead *, n\n\nRead *, str\n\nBut if the first line is just the integer, then the second line is the string. However, in Fortran, the second read may read the first word of the next line. To read the entire line, perhaps using a formatted read with an asterisk and a sufficiently large character variable.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function GET_LINE or something, but Fortran 90+ has the GET command, but perhaps better to use the standard read with an asterisk and a large enough string.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line as a string, then parse n from the first part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step's code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as an integer n, then the next line as the string.\n\nIn code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\n\ninteger :: n\n\nread *, n\n\nread *, str\n\nWait, but if the second line is longer than the length of str, it will be truncated. So perhaps better to use a larger length, like 100000 or something.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, perhaps the string is up to 1e5 characters. But in the first Java program, the code uses a string, so in Fortran, we can set a sufficiently large length.\n\nAssuming the string is up to, say, 1e5 characters, but in code, perhaps 100000.\n\nSo first step:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: str\n\ninteger :: n\n\nread *, n\n\nread *, str\n\nThen, check if the string is equal to a concatenated with a, where a is the first half.\n\nThe first half is the first n/2 characters (since n is the length of the string? Wait, no. Wait in the first Java program, n is the input integer, but the string is read via nextLine(). So the length of the string may not be n. Wait, looking at the first Java code:\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the code is:\n\nn = cin.nextInt();\n\ncin.nextLine();\n\nstr = cin.nextLine();\n\nSo the first line is the integer n, then the next line is the string. The string's length can be anything, not necessarily n. The code then loops for i from 0 to n/2 -1, appending characters to a. Wait, but the loop is for (int i=0; i < n/2; i++), so the a is built from the first n/2 characters of the string. Then, it checks if the entire string equals a + a. So the string's length must be exactly n, because a is n/2 characters, so a+a is n characters. So the code expects that the string's length is exactly n. So in the input, the second line must be exactly n characters long. So in Fortran, the string's length must be exactly n. So perhaps in the code, we can check that, but the problem's input is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first step's code:\n\na is the first n/2 characters of str.\n\nThen check if str == a // a.\n\nIf yes, then first_output is \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nSecond step:\n\nThe second step takes the first_output string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and processes it through the DP problem.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nThe input is a string s (the first_output). The code initializes a DP array of size (n+1) x 2, where n is the length of s.\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the input is a string s, which is the first_output (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"). So the length of s is 3 or 2 (since \"Yes\" is 3, \"No\" is 2). So the DP array is of size (length+1) x 2.\n\nThe DP transitions are as per the code.\n\nThe final output is (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second step's input is the first_output string (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nWe need to process this string through the DP steps.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be a 2D array of integers. Since the mod is 1e9+7, which is a big number, we need to use integers that can hold that. In Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes (selected_int_kind(18)), so we can use integer(8).\n\nThe steps for the second step:\n\nRead the input string (first_output_str).\n\nCompute the DP array.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nint M = 1000000007;\n\nchar[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();\n\nint n = s.length;\n\nint[][] dp = new int[n+1][2];\n\ndp[0][0] = 1;\n\nThen loops over each character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe can represent the DP array as a 2D array of integers (8 bytes).\n\nInitialize dp(0,1) = 1 (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit declarations).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So perhaps:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:n, 0:1) :: dp\n\nBut need to declare the size based on the length of the input string.\n\nWait, the input string for the second step is the first_output_str, which is either \"Yes\" (length 3) or \"No\" (length 2). Let's call the length m.\n\nSo m = len_trim(first_output_str).\n\nThen, the DP array is (m+1) x 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: first_output_str\n\ninteger :: m\n\nm = len_trim(first_output_str)\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:m, 0:1) :: dp\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\nThen loop over each character in the string.\n\nThe characters are the first_output_str's characters. In Fortran, the characters can be accessed via first_output_str(1:1), etc.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so first_output_str(i:i) gives the ith character.\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo i = 1, m\n\n   current_char = first_output_str(i:i)\n\n   ... process ...\n\nend do\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < n; i++), so the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, the first character is i=1, but in the code, the loop variable i in Java corresponds to the Fortran's i from 1 to m.\n\nNow, the code's logic:\n\nIn the Java code, for each character s[i], the code does:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nThen, there's another block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the code's logic step by step.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n    }\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the first part of the loop (the first if-else) sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] based on the current character. Then, the second part (another if-else) modifies those values again.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, handle the first part (the first if-else), then handle the second part (the second if-else).\n\nSo for each character:\n\nFirst, if the character is '0', then set dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to the previous values. Else, set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M.\n\nThen, regardless of the first condition, check the character again for the second part.\n\nWait, the second part's condition is again checking if the character is '0', and then adding to dp[i+1][1], etc.\n\nThis is a bit complex. Let me try to restructure the code's logic.\n\nThe first part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\n}\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to the previous values. Then, in the second part, since s[i] is '0', it adds (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to the previous values. Then, in the second part, since s[i] is '0', the second part adds (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nWait, but dp[i][1] is the previous value, not the current dp[i+1][1]. Because the first part's assignments are to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], but the second part's additions are based on dp[i][1], not the updated dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, in the first part, the first part's assignments are to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], but the second part's code uses dp[i][1], not the new dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nIn the first part, the first if-else sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nThen, the second part's if-else modifies those values further, but using the previous dp[i][...] values.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the code again:\n\nThe first part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, in the second part, when s[i] is '0', the code adds (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], which was set in the first part to dp[i][1]. So the total becomes dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2 mod M) mod M.\n\nWait, but the first part's assignment for dp[i+1][1] when s[i] is '0' is dp[i][1], then the second part adds (dp[i][1] * 2 mod M) to it. So the total is dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2 mod M), then mod M again.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. To translate this into Fortran, I need to carefully replicate the steps.\n\nNow, the third step:\n\nThe third step takes the output of the second step (the number as a string) and checks the last non-space/non-? character.\n\nThe third Java program's code:\n\nReads a string s (the second step's output, which is a number like \"12345\").\n\nThen loops from the end backwards until it finds a character that is not ' ' or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase).\n\nIn Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the second step's output (a string, e.g., \"12345\").\n\nLoop from the end of the string backward until a character that is not ' ' or '?' is found.\n\nConvert that character to lowercase.\n\nCheck if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\nOutput \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must:\n\n1. Read n and the string (first step's input).\n\n2. Compute first step's output (Yes/No).\n\n3. Use that string as input to the second step's processing (the DP problem), resulting in a number (as a string).\n\n4. Use that number string as input to the third step's processing (check last character).\n\n5. Output the third step's result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement all steps in Fortran without intermediate I/O.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- For the first step:\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   character(len=100000) :: str\n\n   character(len=4) :: first_output\n\n- For the second step:\n\n   character(len=10) :: second_input (the first_output string)\n\n   integer(8) :: mod_value = 1000000007\n\n   integer :: m (length of second_input)\n\n   integer(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\n   integer(8) :: result_second\n\n- For the third step:\n\n   character(len=20) :: second_output_str (the result from second step as a string)\n\n   character(len=20) :: third_input (the second_output_str)\n\n   character :: last_char\n\n   logical :: is_vowel\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and str:\n\nread *, n\n\nread *, str\n\nCompute first step's output:\n\na is the first n/2 characters of str.\n\nif (len_trim(str) /= n) then\n\n   ! error, but assuming input is correct.\n\nend if\n\na = str(1:n/2)\n\nif (str == a // a) then\n\n   first_output = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n   first_output = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nSecond step processing:\n\nsecond_input = first_output\n\nm = len_trim(second_input)\n\nallocate(dp(0:m, 0:1))\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\ndo i = 1, m\n\n   current_char = second_input(i:i)\n\n   ! first part of the loop\n\n   if (current_char == '0') then\n\n      dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n      dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), mod_value)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! second part of the loop\n\n   if (current_char == '0') then\n\n      temp = mod(dp(i-1,1)*2, mod_value)\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp, mod_value)\n\n   else\n\n      temp0 = mod(dp(i-1,0)*2, mod_value)\n\n      temp1 = mod(dp(i-1,1)*2, mod_value)\n\n      dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + temp0, mod_value)\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp1, mod_value)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nresult_second = mod(dp(m,0) + dp(m,1), mod_value)\n\n! convert result_second to a string for third step\n\nwrite(second_output_str, '(I0)') result_second\n\nThird step processing:\n\nthird_input = second_output_str\n\n! find last non-space and non-? character\n\nlast_char = ' '\n\ndo i = len_trim(third_input), 1, -1\n\n   c = third_input(i:i)\n\n   if (c /= ' ' .and. c /= '?') then\n\n      last_char = c\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! convert to lowercase\n\nlast_char = achar(ichar(last_char) + 32)  ! assuming uppercase letters\n\n! check if vowel\n\nis_vowel = .false.\n\nselect case (last_char)\n\ncase ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y')\n\n   is_vowel = .true.\n\nend select\n\nif (is_vowel) then\n\n   print *, 'YES'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'NO'\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the achar and ichar functions can be used to convert to lowercase. However, if the character is already lowercase, adding 32 would be wrong. So perhaps better to use a lowercase check.\n\nAlternatively, check both cases:\n\nif (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n\n   last_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nThen check if it is in the vowel list.\n\nAlternatively, check both lowercase and uppercase, but the problem says to treat case-insensitively.\n\nWait, the third Java program uses Character.toLowerCase(ch), so in Fortran, we need to convert the character to lowercase first.\n\nSo the code for the third step:\n\n...\n\nlast_char = third_input(i:i)\n\nlast_char = achar(ichar(last_char) + 32)  ! assuming uppercase, but this is not correct for lowercase letters.\n\nWait, no. To convert to lowercase, we can use:\n\nif (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n\n   last_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function:\n\nlast_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32) if it's uppercase.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, check both cases:\n\nif (last_char == 'A' or 'a', etc. But perhaps better to convert to lowercase first.\n\nSo the code:\n\nlast_char = third_input(i:i)\n\nif (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n\n   last_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nThen check if it is in the vowel list.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut also, in the second step's code, the DP array needs to be properly initialized and handled.\n\nWait, in the first part of the loop (the first if-else), the first part sets dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) based on the current character. Then the second part modifies those values using the previous dp(i-1, ...) values.\n\nWait, in the first part, when the character is '0', the first part sets dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) to the previous values (dp(i-1,0) and dp(i-1,1)). Then, in the second part, when the character is '0', it adds (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M) to dp(i,1). So the total becomes dp(i-1,1) + (dp(i-1,1)*2 mod M), mod M.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the first part's assignments are to dp(i,0) and dp(i,1). The second part's additions are to those same dp(i, ...) values, but using the previous dp(i-1, ...) values.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the first part, for s[i] == '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], and dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1].\n\nThen, in the second part, since s[i] is '0', it adds (dp[i][1] * 2 mod M) to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nSo the total for dp[i+1][1] is dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] * 2 mod M), mod M.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the first part's assignments are to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part modifies those values.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, the code must first set the first part's values, then apply the second part's modifications.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nIn the first part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n   dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n   dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\nelse\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), mod_value)\n\nend if\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n   temp = mod(dp(i-1,1)*2, mod_value)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp, mod_value)\n\nelse\n\n   temp0 = mod(dp(i-1,0)*2, mod_value)\n\n   temp1 = mod(dp(i-1,1)*2, mod_value)\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + temp0, mod_value)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + temp1, mod_value)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the else part of the second part (when current_char is not '0'), the code adds to dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) the temp0 and temp1, respectively.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the code for the second step's loop.\n\nNow, the DP array is initialized with dp(0,0) = 1, others 0.\n\nNow, the final result is (dp(m,0) + dp(m,1)) mod mod_value.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the final output is (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M, where n is the length of the string. So in Fortran, m is the length of the input string (second_input), so the final result is mod(dp(m,0) + dp(m,1), mod_value).\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop runs from i=1 to m, so after the loop, the dp(m,0) and dp(m,1) are the final values.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second step's result is stored in result_second, which is then converted to a string for the third step.\n\nThe third step's input is this string.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\nLoop from the end of the string backward until a non-space and non-? character is found.\n\nOnce found, convert to lowercase and check if it's a vowel.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut also, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So when declaring the DP array, we need to make sure that the indices are correct.\n\nWait, in the code above, the DP array is declared as dimension(0:m, 0:1), so it's 0-based for the first index (0 to m), and 0-based for the second (0 and 1).\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program:\n\nBut also, need to handle the string lengths properly.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the first step:\n\nRead n and the string.\n\nThen compute first_output.\n\nThen second step's processing.\n\nThen third step's processing.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, i, j\n\n   character(len=100000) :: str\n\n   character(len=4) :: first_output\n\n   character(len=20) :: second_output_str\n\n   character(len=20) :: third_input\n\n   character :: last_char\n\n   logical :: is_vowel\n\n   integer(8) :: mod_value = 1000000007\n\n   !

Because the first Java program's code loops for n/2 iterations, so the string must have even length. But in the first Java program, the code does not check if the string's length is even. It just takes the first n/2 characters, where n is the input integer. Wait, in the first Java program, the input n is read first, then the string is read. The code then uses n as the length of the string? Or is n the length of the string?\n\nWait, in the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's code reads n as an integer, then reads the string. The code then loops for i from 0 to n/2 -1, appending characters to a. The a is then concatenated with itself, and compared to the original string. So the original string must have length exactly n, and n must be even for the code to work properly. Otherwise, the code may have an off-by-one error.\n\nBut the problem's input is assumed to be correct, so the code can proceed.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, the first step checks if the length of the string is equal to n. If not, it skips error handling. But in the code, the check is:\n\nif (len_trim(str) /= n) then\n\n   ! Assuming input is correct, so skip error handling\n\nend if\n\nBut perhaps this is unnecessary, but added for safety.\n\nAlso, in the first step, the code checks if n is even (mod(n,2) ==0). Because if n is odd, then n/2 is not an integer, so the first half would be (n-1)/2 characters, but the code would still proceed. However, in the Java code, the loop runs for i < n/2, so the first half is n/2 characters (integer division). So in Fortran, when n is odd, the first half is (n/2) characters (integer division), so the code should still work.\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so n/2 is integer division. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the second step's code:\n\nThe second_input is first_output, which is either 'Yes' (length 3) or 'No' (length 2).\n\nThe DP array is dimensioned as 0:m, where m is the length of second_input.\n\nThe loop runs from 1 to m.\n\nThe code for the first part and second part is as above.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\nThe third_input is the string representation of the second step's result.\n\nThe loop finds the last non-space and non-? character.\n\nOnce found, it converts to lowercase and checks.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The DP array in Fortran is declared with 0:m, which requires that m is known at compile time. But in Fortran, the array can be allocated dynamically. Wait, in the code above, the DP array is declared with dimension(0:m, 0:1), but m is a variable. This is not allowed in Fortran unless it's an allocatable array.\n\nAh, right! I made a mistake here. The DP array must be allocatable.\n\nIn the code above, I had:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:m, 0:1) :: dp\n\nBut m is a variable, so this is not allowed. Instead, the array must be allocatable.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nallocate(dp(0:m, 0:1))\n\nbefore the loop.\n\nSo the corrected code for the second step:\n\n   ! Second step\n\n   character(len=4) :: second_input = first_output\n\n   m = len_trim(second_input)\n\n   integer(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\n   allocate(dp(0:m, 0:1))\n\n   dp = 0\n\n   dp(0,0) = 1\n\n   do i = 1, m\n\n      ... \n\n   end do\n\n   deallocate(dp)\n\n   integer(8) :: result_second = mod(dp(m,0) + dp(m,1), mod_value)\n\nWait, but after deallocate, dp is no longer accessible. So the deallocate should be after computing result_second.\n\nSo:\n\n   allocate(dp(0:m, 0:1))\n\n   dp = 0\n\n   dp(0,0) = 1\n\n   do i = 1, m\n\n      ... \n\n   end do\n\n   result_second = mod(dp(m,0) + dp(m,1), mod_value)\n\n   deallocate(dp)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first step, when n is odd, the code checks mod(n,2) ==0. But the original Java code does not do this. The Java code proceeds even if n is odd. For example, if n is 5, then the first half is 2 characters (since 5/2 is 2 in integer division), and the code checks if the string equals a + a (4 characters), but the string's length is n (5), so it would never be equal. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting all together with the corrections:\n\nThe final Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, i, j\n\n   character(len=100000) :: str\n\n   character(len=4) :: first_output\n\n   character(len=20) :: second_output_str\n\n   character(len=20) :: third_input\n\n   character :: last_char\n\n   logical :: is_vowel\n\n   integer(8) :: mod_value = 1000000007\n\n   !
