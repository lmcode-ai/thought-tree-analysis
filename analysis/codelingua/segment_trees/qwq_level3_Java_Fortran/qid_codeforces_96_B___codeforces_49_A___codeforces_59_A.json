Next iteration: mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10', temp becomes 0. So yes. So this function returns the binary string as a character string.

So the final Fortran program will always output \"NO\". But perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Wait, let me think of mask=7 (binary 111 \u2192 substring(1) is '11' \u2192 zeros 0, length 2 \u2192 0 != 2 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=6 \u2192 binary 110 \u2192 substring(1) is '10' \u2192 zeros 1, length 2 \u2192 1 == 1 \u2192 yes. So new_str is '47' \u2192 value 47. So the second program's input is \"47\" \u2192 last character '7' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 \"NO\". Another example: mask= 15 \u2192 binary 1111 \u2192 substring(1) is '111' \u2192 length 3 \u2192 zeros 0 \u2192 not equal to 3 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 14 \u2192 binary 1110 \u2192 substring(1) is '110' \u2192 zeros 1, length 3 \u2192 1 vs 2 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 12 \u2192 binary 1100 \u2192 substring(1) is '100' \u2192 zeros 2, length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 10 \u2192 binary 1010 \u2192 substring(1) is '010' \u2192 zeros 2, length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 9 \u2192 binary 1001 \u2192 substring(1) is '001' \u2192 zeros 2 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 8 \u2192 binary 1000 \u2192 substring(1) is '000' \u2192 zeros 3, length 3 \u2192 yes. So new_str is '444' \u2192 value 444. Second program's input is \"444\" \u2192 last character '4' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 \"NO\". So indeed, the second program will always output \"NO\".",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_96_B) reads a long number from input. It then generates binary numbers starting from 2 (since mask starts at 2), converts them to strings, checks if the number of zeros equals the number of ones (since zeros != s.length() - zeros would mean they are equal?), wait no, the condition is if zeros != (length - zeros), so if they are not equal, it skips. Wait, no, the condition is \"if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\" so if they are not equal, it skips this iteration. So only when the number of zeros equals the number of ones does it proceed. Then it replaces 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, converts that string to a long. It keeps doing this until the value is >= the input number. Then it prints that value. Wait, actually, the loop continues until value is less than the input number. Wait, the loop is while (value < number). So it increments mask each time, and when the generated value is >= number, it stops and outputs the value. Wait, but the loop condition is while (value < number), so the loop runs as long as value is less than number. So the loop continues until the value is no longer less than the input. So the first value that is >= the input is the one printed. Hmm, but the code inside the loop is trying to find the first such value where the binary string has equal 0s and 1s, then converts to 4 and 7. So the first such number that is >= the input is the answer.\n\nThe second program (codeforces_49_A) takes a string, looks for the last non-space and non-question mark character, checks if it's a vowel (case-insensitive), and outputs YES or NO accordingly.\n\nThe third program (codeforces_59_A) takes a word, counts uppercase and lowercase letters, then converts the entire word to uppercase if there are more uppercase letters, lowercase otherwise, or lowercase if equal.\n\nNow, the sequence is: the output of the first program is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third. Wait, but looking at the Java code, each program reads from stdin and writes to stdout. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (the first program's input), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and then output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the number for the first program).\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the first output (the number converted to 4 and 7 string, then parsed as a long, but the first program's output is that value).\nWait, the first program's output is the value (the long) which is printed. So the first program's output is a number. Then the second program takes that number as input? Wait, no. Wait, the second program's input is a string. Wait, the second Java program's input is read via nextLine(), so it's expecting a string. But the first program's output is a number (like 47, 447, etc.), so when you pipe the first's output to the second, the second will read that as a string. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output. So the first program's output is a number, which is written as a string to the next program's input.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first program's output is a long, which is printed as a string. So the second program's input is that string. So the second program's input is the string of the first's output. Then the second program processes that string, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is then the input to the third program. The third program reads a string (the \"YES\" or \"NO\"), but then counts uppercase and lowercase letters. Wait, but \"YES\" has all uppercase, \"NO\" has uppercase as well. Wait, the third program's input is a single word (since it uses next(), which reads the next token). Wait, the second program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the third program's input is that string. So the third program will process that string, count uppercase and lowercase letters, and decide to output in uppercase or lowercase.\n\nWait, but \"YES\" has all uppercase letters, so uppercase count is 3, lowercase 0. So the third program would output in uppercase (since uppercase > lowercase). So the final output would be \"YES\" in uppercase (same as input) or \"NO\" in uppercase. Wait, but the third program's code says: if uppercase > lowercase, output uppercase; else lowercase. So for \"YES\", uppercase is 3, lowercase 0, so output uppercase. So the third program's output would be \"YES\" again. For \"NO\", uppercase is 2, lowercase 1 (since 'N' and 'O' are uppercase? Wait, \"NO\" is two uppercase letters. Wait, \"NO\" is N and O, both uppercase. So uppercase is 2, lowercase 0. So the third program would output uppercase, so \"NO\" again. Wait, but the third program's code says if uppercase > lowercase, then uppercase, else lowercase. Since uppercase is 2, lowercase 0, so uppercase is more, so output uppercase. So the third program's output would be the same as the input. So the final output would be the same as the second program's output. Hmm, but maybe I need to check that.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase \u2192 uppercase\nelse if lowercase > uppercase \u2192 lowercase\nelse \u2192 lowercase.\n\nSo for \"YES\", uppercase is 3, lowercase 0 \u2192 uppercase, so output \"YES\".\n\nFor \"NO\", uppercase is 2, lowercase 0 \u2192 uppercase, so output \"NO\".\n\nSo the third program's output is the same as the second's output. So the final output is the same as the second's output. Wait, but that's only if the input to the third is \"YES\" or \"NO\". So the third program's processing doesn't change the output in this case. But maybe in other cases, but in this specific sequence, the third program's output is the same as the second's. But perhaps the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated, so even if the third program's output is same, it's still part of the process.\n\nAnyway, the Fortran program must process all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input and the last writing output.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the number for the first step).\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the first output (the value).\n3. Convert that value to a string (since the second step requires a string input).\n4. Process the second program's logic on that string to get the second output (YES/NO).\n5. Process the third program's logic on that string (YES/NO) to get the final output (which is same as second's output in this case).\n6. Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst program's logic:\n\n- Read a long number (input).\n- Starting from mask = 2, increment mask each time.\n- Convert mask to binary string, then take substring from index 1 (since in Java, substring(1) would exclude the first character). Wait, the code is:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nWait, mask is an integer, so toBinaryString converts it to binary string. Then substring(1) takes from index 1 to end. So for example, if mask is 2 (binary \"10\"), substring(1) is \"0\". Wait, but mask starts at 2, so mask++ is 2 first, then increments. Wait, mask is initialized to 2, then in the loop:\n\nmask starts at 2, then mask++ increments after using it. So first iteration uses mask=2, then mask becomes 3.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nmask = 2;\n\nloop:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nSo the first time, mask is 2, so the binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nWait, but the code is looking for binary strings where the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. Because the condition is zeros != (length - zeros) \u2192 if they are equal, then zeros == (length - zeros), so the condition would be false, so it proceeds. Wait, the condition is:\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\nSo if zeros is not equal to (length - zeros), then continue (skip this iteration). So only when zeros equals (length - zeros) do we proceed. So the binary string must have equal number of 0s and 1s. So the length must be even, since 0s + 1s = length, so 0s = 1s \u2192 length even.\n\nSo the binary string (after substring(1)) must have equal 0s and 1s. Wait, but the substring(1) is taking the binary string of mask, starting from the second character. So for mask=2 (binary \"10\"), substring(1) is \"0\", which has 1 zero and 0 ones \u2192 not equal. So that would be skipped. Hmm, perhaps I need to think through the first program's logic again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nmask starts at 2. Then, in each iteration:\n\ns is the binary string of mask, but starting from index 1 (so excluding the first character). Then, count the zeros. Then check if zeros equals the number of ones (since zeros = s.length - zeros \u2192 zeros = (number of 1s) \u2192 so total is 2*zeros. So the length must be even.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nzeros is the count of '0's in s. The number of '1's is s.length() - zeros. So the condition is if zeros != (s.length() - zeros), then continue. So only when zeros equals (s.length() - zeros) \u2192 i.e., the number of 0s equals the number of 1s \u2192 proceed.\n\nSo the binary string (after substring(1)) must have equal 0s and 1s. Then, replace 0 with 4, 1 with 7, then parse as a long. The first such value that is >= the input number is the answer.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first such value (the converted number) that is >= the input.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, we need to read the input number (the first program's input). Let's say the input is stored in a variable called input_num (of type integer*8 or something).\n\nThen, we need to loop over mask starting from 2 upwards. For each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting from the second character (since Java's substring(1) is from index 1, which is the second character in 0-based).\n\nWait, in Java, the binary string of mask is generated, then substring(1) takes from index 1 to end. So for mask=3 (binary \"11\"), substring(1) is \"1\".\n\nWait, mask is an integer, so toBinaryString(mask) gives the binary string. So for mask=2, binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nSo in Fortran, how to get the binary string of mask, then substring from the second character?\n\nHmm, in Fortran, converting an integer to a binary string can be done with a function. Let's think of writing a function to convert an integer to a binary string. Let's say we have a function int_to_bin that takes an integer and returns a string.\n\nThen, for each mask starting at 2, we do:\n\nbinary_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\ns = binary_str(2: len_trim(binary_str)) \u2192 because in Fortran, the substring from the second character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps better to use a character array. Alternatively, use a function to get the substring.\n\nOnce we have s, we need to count the number of '0's in s. Then check if the count is equal to the length of s minus the count (i.e., number of 1's). If not, skip.\n\nIf yes, then replace all 0's with '4's and 1's with '7's, then convert that string to a number (the value). Then check if this value is >= input_num. The first such value is the one to be passed to the next step.\n\nWait, but the loop continues until value < input_num. Wait, the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the code in Java is:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... compute s, then value = Long.parseLong(s) ...\n\n}\n\nSo the loop runs as long as the current value is less than the input number. So the loop continues until the value is >= the input. The first such value is the one that is printed.\n\nWait, but in the code, after generating s, they set value = Long.parseLong(s). So each iteration, they compute the value from the current s, and if that value is >= the input, then the loop exits, and that value is printed.\n\nWait, but the loop is while (value < number). So the loop continues as long as the current value is less than the input. So the loop will exit when the value is >= the input. So the first time the value is >= the input, the loop stops, and that value is the answer.\n\nWait, but the code inside the loop is:\n\nmask starts at 2, and increments each time. So for each mask, we compute s, then check if the 0s and 1s are equal. If yes, then compute the value. Then, if that value is >= the input, then the loop will exit, and that value is the answer. But the loop condition is while (value < number). Wait, but the value is only set when the condition is met (i.e., when the 0s and 1s are equal). So the loop may have multiple iterations where the value is not set (because the condition is skipped). Hmm, perhaps the code is structured as:\n\nInitialize value to 0.\n\nLoop:\n\n   compute s from mask's binary string (substring(1))\n\n   count zeros.\n\n   if zeros != (length - zeros), continue to next iteration (so mask increments, and loop continues).\n\n   else:\n\n      create the s with 4 and 7, parse to value.\n\n      if this value is >= number, then the loop will exit, and the value is the answer.\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop continues as long as value is less than number. So the loop will run until the value is >= number. But the value is only updated when the condition is met. So the first time the generated value is >= the input, the loop stops, and that value is the answer.\n\nWait, but the initial value is 0. So the first time the generated value is >= the input, the loop will exit. So the code is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the first part are:\n\nRead input_num (the initial input).\n\nInitialize mask = 2.\n\nLoop:\n\n   compute binary_str of mask.\n\n   s = substring starting from second character.\n\n   count zeros in s.\n\n   if zeros /= (len(s) - zeros), then mask +=1, continue loop.\n\n   else:\n\n      create new_str by replacing '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\n      convert new_str to a number (value).\n\n      if value >= input_num, then break the loop and proceed.\n\n      else, mask +=1 and continue.\n\nWait, but the loop is while (value < input_num). So in Fortran, perhaps we can structure it as a do loop until value >= input_num.\n\nAlternatively, a loop that increments mask until the condition is met.\n\nHmm, perhaps a do-while loop structure.\n\nAlternatively, a loop that runs indefinitely until the condition is met.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ninput_num = read from stdin.\n\nmask = 2\n\nvalue = 0\n\ndo while (value < input_num)\n\n   binary_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   s = binary_str(2: len_trim(binary_str))\n\n   zeros = count_zeros(s)\n\n   if (zeros /= (len_trim(s) - zeros)) then\n\n      mask = mask +1\n\n      cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   new_str = replace_0_and_1(s)\n\n   read(new_str, *) value\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but after replacing, the new_str is the string of 4 and 7. So converting that to a number. So the value is the numeric value of new_str.\n\nWait, but in Java, they parse the string as a long. So in Fortran, we can read the string into a variable as a number.\n\nBut in Fortran, the read statement can read a string into a number. So for example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: new_str\n\nread(new_str, *) value\n\nBut need to ensure that the string is properly formatted.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would involve:\n\n- A function to convert an integer to a binary string.\n\n- A function to count the number of '0's in a string.\n\n- A function to replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\nAlternatively, inline these steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the functions.\n\nFirst, converting an integer to a binary string.\n\nFunction int_to_bin(n) result(bin_str)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: n\n\ncharacter(len=64) :: bin_str\n\ninteger :: i, temp\n\nbin_str = ''\n\ntemp = n\n\ndo i = 1, 64\n\n   bin_str(i:i) = char(mod(temp,2) + 48)\n\n   temp = temp / 2\n\nend do\n\n! Reverse the string because we built it from least significant bit first.\n\nbin_str = reverse(bin_str)\n\n! Remove leading zeros.\n\nbin_str = adjustl(bin_str)\n\nend function\n\nWait, but this might not be the best way. Alternatively, use a loop to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach:\n\nFunction int_to_bin(n) result(bin_str)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: n\n\ncharacter(len=64) :: bin_str\n\ninteger :: i, temp\n\nbin_str = ''\n\ntemp = n\n\ndo while (temp > 0)\n\n   bin_str = char(mod(temp,2) + 48) // bin_str\n\n   temp = temp / 2\n\nend do\n\nif (bin_str == '') then\n\n   bin_str = '0'\n\nend if\n\nend function\n\nWait, but this builds the binary string correctly. For example, n=2 (10) would be '10'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ntemp = 2 \u2192 mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 bin_str becomes '0', then temp becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10', temp becomes 0. So yes.\n\nSo this function returns the binary string as a character string.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps we need to handle that. Alternatively, use a character array with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with enough length, and then trim it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function can return a string with leading zeros removed, but in our case, the mask starts at 2, so the binary string will not be empty.\n\nOnce we have the binary string, we take the substring starting from the second character (since in Java it's substring(1)), so in Fortran, s = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str)).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the function returns a string with leading zeros removed? Wait, no, the function as written builds the string from the least significant bit upwards, but the code above builds the string correctly. Wait, the function builds the string by appending to the left. So for n=2, the first mod is 0, then 1, so the string is '10'.\n\nSo bin_str would be '10' for mask=2. So s would be bin_str(2:2) \u2192 '0'.\n\nThen, count the number of '0's in s.\n\nSo for s = '0', zeros is 1, length is 1. So zeros (1) is not equal to length - zeros (0), so it skips.\n\nSo mask increments to 3.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary is '11', so bin_str is '11'. s is '1' (substring from 2nd character). zeros is 0, length is 1 \u2192 0 vs 1 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary '100' \u2192 bin_str is '100'. s is '00' (characters 2 and 3). zeros count is 2, length is 2 \u2192 2 == 2 \u2192 proceed.\n\nThen replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7. So s is '00' \u2192 becomes '44', which is 44. So if input_num is 44, then this is the value.\n\nSo the first program's code would find this as the first value >= input_num.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would need to loop mask from 2 upwards, compute the binary string, substring, check zeros, etc.\n\nNow, moving on to the second program's logic.\n\nSecond program's input is the string representation of the first program's output (the value). So in Fortran, after the first part, we have the value (e.g., 44 \u2192 \"44\"), so the second step's input is the string \"44\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program reads the input as a string via nextLine(). So the first program's output is a number, which is printed as a string. So the second program's input is that string (e.g., \"44\").\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nRead the string s.\n\nFind the last character that is not a space or '?'. Then check if that character is a vowel (case-insensitive). Output YES or NO.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first part, we have the value (e.g., 44). We need to convert that to a string (e.g., \"44\"), then process it as per the second program.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a number. So in Fortran, after computing the value (the first program's output), we need to convert it to a string (e.g., using write statement into a character variable).\n\nSo after the first part, we have the value (e.g., 44). We can write it to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2_input\n\nwrite(s2_input, '(i0)') value\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process s2_input as per the second program's logic.\n\nProcessing the second program's logic:\n\nLoop from the end of the string backwards until a non-space and non-'?' is found.\n\nOnce found, check if it is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize ch to 0 (but in Fortran, characters are different). Let's use a character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: ch\n\ndo i = len_trim(s2_input), 1, -1\n\n   if (s2_input(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s2_input(i:i) /= '?') then\n\n      ch = s2_input(i:i)\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert ch to lowercase.\n\nif (ch is a vowel \u2192 'a','e','i','o','u','y'), then output YES else NO.\n\nIn Fortran, converting to lowercase can be done with ichar and achar functions.\n\nch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32) if it's uppercase.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are stored as ASCII. So:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n   ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nThen check if ch is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nSo the second part's code in Fortran would process the string s2_input (the first program's output as a string) and produce a result (YES or NO).\n\nThird program's input is the output of the second program (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nThe third program counts uppercase and lowercase letters in the input string, then converts the entire string to uppercase if uppercase count > lowercase, else lowercase.\n\nIn Fortran, the input to the third part is the string from the second part's output (e.g., \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nSo after the second part, we have a string (s3_input) which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nProcessing the third program's logic:\n\ncount uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nThen decide which case to output.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s3_input)\n\n   if (s3_input(i:i) >= 'A' .and. s3_input(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n\n      uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else\n\n      lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   s3_output = uppercase(s3_input)\n\nelse\n\n   s3_output = lowercase(s3_input)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, there's no built-in uppercase or lowercase functions. So need to write a function to convert to uppercase or lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, for the uppercase case, we can loop through each character and convert to uppercase if needed, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for the third program's case, since the input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are all uppercase, the uppercase count will be the length, and lowercase 0. So the third program will output uppercase, which is same as input. But the code requires to process it.\n\nBut regardless, the code must be translated.\n\nSo for the third part:\n\nFunction to convert to uppercase:\n\nfunction to_upper(str) result(res)\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: str\n\ncharacter(len=len(str)) :: res\n\ninteger :: i\n\ndo i = 1, len(str)\n\n   if (str(i:i) >= 'a' .and. str(i:i) <= 'z') then\n\n      res(i:i) = achar(ichar(str(i:i)) - 32)\n\n   else\n\n      res(i:i) = str(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nend function\n\nSimilarly for to_lower.\n\nAlternatively, for the third program's case, since the input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are uppercase, the uppercase count is 3 or 2, so the output will be the same as input. But the code must be written properly.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program will have:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the number for the first program).\n\n2. Process first program's logic to get the value.\n\n3. Convert that value to a string (s2_input).\n\n4. Process second program's logic on s2_input to get the result (YES/NO as a string s3_input).\n\n5. Process third program's logic on s3_input to get the final output (s_final).\n\n6. Print s_final.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's code.\n\nBut first, need to write the functions for converting to binary, counting zeros, etc.\n\nAlternatively, inline the functions.\n\nLet me try to write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger*8 :: input_num, value, mask\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2_input, s3_input, s_final\n\n!

For example, in the first part's loop, the do loop continues until value >= input_num. The loop is a do-forever loop with an exit when the condition is met.\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nThe loop is a do loop with cycle and exit.\n\nWait, in the code above, after computing new_str and value, if value >= input_num, exit the loop. Else, mask +=1 and continue.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nif (value >= input_num) then\n\n   exit\n\nelse\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend if\n\nBut the loop is a do loop, so after exit, it proceeds. So that should work.\n\nAnother thing: in the second part, when converting to lowercase, the code checks if the character is uppercase and converts it. But in the second program's case, the input is a number string (like \"44\"), so the character found (the last non-space and non-?) would be a digit, so the check for vowel would be false, leading to \"NO\".\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the value is a number like 44, so the second program's input is \"44\". The last character is '4', which is not a vowel, so the second program outputs \"NO\". Then the third program processes \"NO\".\n\nWait, but let's see an example:\n\nSuppose input_num is 44.\n\nFirst program's output is 44 \u2192 s2_input is \"44\".\n\nSecond program's processing:\n\nLooking for last non-space and non-? \u2192 '4' (since it's the last character). '4' is not a vowel \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nThird program's input is \"NO\".\n\nProcessing \"NO\":\n\nuppercase count is 2 (N and O), lowercase 0 \u2192 uppercase > lowercase \u2192 output uppercase \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nSo the final output is \"NO\".\n\nAnother example: input_num is 47 (the first possible value where the binary string after substring(1) has equal 0s and 1s? Let's see.\n\nWait, let's think of mask=3: binary is 11 \u2192 substring(1) is '1' \u2192 zeros 0, length 1 \u2192 not equal.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary 100 \u2192 substring(2:3) is '00' \u2192 zeros 2, length 2 \u2192 equal \u2192 new_str is '44' \u2192 value 44.\n\nmask=5 \u2192 binary 101 \u2192 substring(2:3) is '01' \u2192 zeros 1, length 2 \u2192 1 vs 1 \u2192 equal. So new_str is '47' \u2192 value 47.\n\nSo if input_num is 47, then the first program's output is 47.\n\nSecond program's input is \"47\" \u2192 last character is '7', not vowel \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nThird program's output is \"NO\".\n\nAnother example: input_num is 4 \u2192 first program's output is 44 \u2192 same as before.\n\nWait, but let's see another case where the second program's output is \"YES\".\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 777 \u2192 but that's not possible. Let's think of a case where the second program's output is \"YES\".\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 7 \u2192 then the second program's input is \"7\", last character is '7' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the first program's output can be a string that ends with a vowel?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number made of 4 and 7. So the digits can only be 4 or 7. Neither are vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the first program's output is a number composed of 4 and 7, so the second program's input is a string of digits (4 and 7), so the last character is either 4 or 7, which are not vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\", so the third program will output \"NO\".\n\nWait, but that's a problem. So in this case, the entire sequence will always output \"NO\" regardless of the input? That can't be right. Did I misunderstand the first program?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first program's code.\n\nThe first program's code generates a binary string (after substring(1)), which has equal 0s and 1s. Then replaces 0 with 4 and 1 with 7. So the resulting string is made of 4 and 7, with the same number of each. So the value is a number composed of 4 and 7 digits, with equal counts of each.\n\nSo the second program's input is a string of 4 and 7, so the last character is either 4 or 7, which are not vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the third program will always output \"NO\".\n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is always \"NO\" regardless of the input? That seems odd, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first program's logic.\n\nWait, let's see an example where the first program's output is a string that ends with a vowel.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is made of 4 and 7. So the digits can't be vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is always \"NO\".\n\nBut that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program's code.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\ns = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nThen, after replacing 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, the string is parsed as a long.\n\nSo the resulting string is made of 4 and 7, so the digits are 4 and 7. So the second program's input is a string of digits, so the last character is a digit, not a vowel. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always \"NO\".\n\nHmm, but that's possible. So the final Fortran program will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code.\n\nWait, let me think of mask=7 (binary 111 \u2192 substring(1) is '11' \u2192 zeros 0, length 2 \u2192 0 != 2 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=6 \u2192 binary 110 \u2192 substring(1) is '10' \u2192 zeros 1, length 2 \u2192 1 == 1 \u2192 yes. So new_str is '47' \u2192 value 47.\n\nSo the second program's input is \"47\" \u2192 last character '7' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nAnother example: mask= 15 \u2192 binary 1111 \u2192 substring(1) is '111' \u2192 length 3 \u2192 zeros 0 \u2192 not equal to 3 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 14 \u2192 binary 1110 \u2192 substring(1) is '110' \u2192 zeros 1, length 3 \u2192 1 vs 2 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 12 \u2192 binary 1100 \u2192 substring(1) is '100' \u2192 zeros 2, length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 10 \u2192 binary 1010 \u2192 substring(1) is '010' \u2192 zeros 2, length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 9 \u2192 binary 1001 \u2192 substring(1) is '001' \u2192 zeros 2 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 2 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask= 8 \u2192 binary 1000 \u2192 substring(1) is '000' \u2192 zeros 3, length 3 \u2192 yes. So new_str is '444' \u2192 value 444.\n\nSecond program's input is \"444\" \u2192 last character '4' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nSo indeed, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the third program will always output \"NO\".\n\nSo the final output is always \"NO\".\n\nHmm, but that's the case. So the Fortran program will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut the user's problem requires translating the sequence, so even if the output is always \"NO\", the code must be written correctly.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code will process all steps, but the final output is always \"NO\".\n\nBut let's proceed with writing the code as per the steps.\n\nNow, in the code above, the first part's loop may have an infinite loop if no such value is found. But according to the problem's first Java program, it will eventually find a value because mask increases indefinitely, and the binary strings will eventually have equal 0s and 1s in the substring.\n\nBut in practice, for any input number, there exists a mask where the generated value is >= the input.\n\nNow, in the code, the first part's loop is a do loop that cycles until the value is found.\n\nNow, the code for the first part's loop may have an error in the mask increment.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter computing new_str and value:\n\nif (value >= input_num) then\n\n   exit\n\nelse\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend if\n\nBut in the loop, after the exit, the loop ends. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the case where the value is exactly equal to input_num, it will exit.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part:\n\nThe second program's input is the string of the first's output (e.g., \"44\").\n\nThe code loops from the end of the string backward until it finds a non-space and non-? character. Since the string is digits, it will find the last character (e.g., '4').\n\nThen, converts to lowercase (still '4'), checks if it's a vowel \u2192 no \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nThird program's processing of \"NO\" \u2192 uppercase count is 2, so output \"NO\".\n\nThus, the final output is \"NO\".\n\nSo the Fortran code will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut the user's problem requires that the code is translated correctly, even if the output is always \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's check for possible errors in the code.\n\nIn the first part's function int_to_bin:\n\nThe function returns a string like '100' for mask=4.\n\nThen, s is bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str)), which for '100' is '00'.\n\nThen, zeros count is 2, length 2 \u2192 equal \u2192 proceed.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error is in the replacement of 0 and 1.\n\nIn the code:\n\nnew_str = s\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(new_str)\n\n   if (new_str(i:i) == '0') then\n\n      new_str(i:i) = '4'\n\n   else if (new_str(i:i) == '1') then\n\n      new_str(i:i) = '7'\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible error is in the loop for the first part.\n\nWait, in the first part's loop:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nAfter processing, if the value is not sufficient, mask is incremented.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's character processing:\n\nThe loop starts from the end of the string and goes backward.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the third part's code:\n\nThe uppercase and lowercase counts are correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the final Fortran code with all the steps."
