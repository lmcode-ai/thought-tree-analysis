    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC178_B). It reads four long integers, then calculates the maximum of a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], and a[1]*a[2]. The output is this maximum value. So the first program's output is this max value.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ARC062_B) takes a string S as input. It calculates a score based on each character in S. For each position i, if i is even (0-based?), the expected character is 'g' if even index, 'p' if odd. Wait, the code says i%2 ==0 then 'g', else 'p'. Then, if the actual character (his) is different from my, the score changes. If my was 'p', add 1, else subtract 1. The output is the total score.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the max product, which is a number. The second program's input is a string. Wait, but how do these connect? Wait, the first program's output is the input to the second? Or maybe the second program's input is the output of the first? Wait, the user said the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Wait, but the second program expects a string input. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (the max product). The second program expects a string input. So how can the first's output be the input to the second? Unless the first's output is converted into a string. But maybe the user made a mistake here? Or perhaps the sequence is different. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second expects a string. So perhaps the first's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second. Then the second processes it, and outputs a number (the score). Then the third program takes that number as input, but the third program expects a string. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to look at the third program's input.\n\nThird program (codeforces_276_B) reads a string from input, then checks the character counts. The output is \"First\" or \"Second\" based on the number of characters with odd counts. So the third program's input is a string. \n\nWait, this is a problem. The first program outputs a number, which is the input to the second. The second program expects a string. So the first's output (a number) must be converted into a string for the second's input. Then the second's output is a number (the score), which is then the input to the third program, which expects a string. So the third program would need to read that number as a string. But how does that work? \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Alternatively, maybe the programs are supposed to be run in sequence where each program's output is the next's input, but the data types must match. Let me check each program's input and output again.\n\nFirst program's output is a number (the max product). Second program's input is a string. So unless the first's output is a string, but in the first program, it's printed as a number. So the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"123\", then the second reads \"123\" as the string S. Then the second's output is a number (the score), which is then the input to the third program. The third program expects a string, so the second's output (a number) is converted to a string and passed as input. \n\nSo the overall flow is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output (number) -> Program2 (reads as string S) -> Output (number) -> Program3 (reads as string) -> Output (First/Second).\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (for Program1), process all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result of Program3.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (four longs). \n\n2. Compute the max product (Program1's result).\n\n3. Use that max product as the input string S for Program2. So the max product is converted to a string, then Program2's logic is applied to that string to compute the score.\n\n4. The score from Program2 is then converted to a string and used as the input for Program3. Program3 processes that string and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nThe final Fortran program must do all of this in sequence, with only the first part reading input, and the last part writing the final output. The intermediate steps must not involve I/O.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read four integers (or longs, but in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes; since Java uses long, which is 64 bits, but in Fortran, we can use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18) for 64-bit. But since the first program's output is a product of two longs, which can be up to 1e18, so we need to use 64-bit integers. However, in Fortran, the default might be 4 bytes, so need to use integer(8) or similar.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the variables are long (64 bits). The product of two longs can be up to 1e18, so in Fortran, we can use integer(8) variables. So first step:\n\nRead four integers (a(0) to a(3)), compute the maximum of the four products.\n\nThen, convert that maximum value to a string (since that's the input to the second program). \n\nSecond step: process that string as S in the second program's logic. The second program's code is:\n\nFor each character in S (the string from first's output), check if the position (0-based?) is even or odd. For even index, expected 'g', else 'p'. Compare with the actual character. If different, add 1 if my was 'p', subtract 1 if 'g'.\n\nWait, the code in the second program:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {\n    char my = i % 2 == 0 ? 'g' : 'p';\n    char his = S.charAt(i);\n    if (my != his) {\n        score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, when my is 'g' (even i), if his is different, then my is 'g', so the condition my == 'p' is false, so add -1. So when my is 'g' and his is different, subtract 1. When my is 'p' (odd i), and his is different, add 1.\n\nWait, the code says: if my != his, then:\n\nif my was 'p', add 1, else (my is 'g') subtract 1.\n\nSo the total score is computed based on that.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second step is to take the string (from first's output), loop over each character, compute the score.\n\nThen, the result of the second step is the score (integer). Then, convert that score to a string (since that's the input to the third program).\n\nThird step: process that string (the score's string) in the third program's logic. The third program counts the frequency of each character. If the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1, output \"First\", else if even number of odd counts (but more than 1?), then \"Second\". Wait, the code in the third program:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nRead a string, count each character's frequency. Then, count how many have odd counts (oddCount). \n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2 !=0)) then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, let me parse the code:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) {\n\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n\n} else {\n\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is \"if oddCount is <=1 OR oddCount is odd (since mod(oddCount,2) !=0)\". Wait, but oddCount can be 1 (which is <=1 and odd), 3 (odd but >1), etc.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount is odd) ) then \"First\".\n\nWait, but if oddCount is 3, which is odd and >1, then it would go to \"First\".\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 so if either of those is true, then \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's a bit odd. Let me see:\n\nSuppose oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes, so \"First\".\n\n1 \u2192 yes \u2192 \"First\".\n\n2 \u2192 even \u2192 no \u2192 so check if the second condition (odd?) no \u2192 so else \u2192 \"Second\".\n\n3 \u2192 yes (odd) \u2192 \"First\".\n\n4 \u2192 even \u2192 no \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nSo the condition is \"if the number of characters with odd counts is even and greater than 1, then Second, else First\".\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd) ) \u2192 then first.\n\nSo for even counts:\n\n- 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 2 \u2192 even, so first condition (<=1) is false, second (odd?) no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 else \u2192 second.\n\n- 4 \u2192 same as 2 \u2192 second.\n\nFor odd counts:\n\n3 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n5 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\nSo the condition is that if the number of odd counts is even and greater than 1 \u2192 second, else first.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is a bit different. Let me re-express the condition:\n\nThe code's condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount mod 2) !=0 )\n\nSo, when oddCount is even and greater than 1 \u2192 then the condition is false \u2192 else \u2192 second.\n\nElse, first.\n\nSo the third program's output is \"First\" unless the number of characters with odd counts is even and greater than 1, in which case \"Second\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the third step is to take the string (from the second's output, which is the score as a string), count the characters' frequencies, compute oddCount, then decide the output.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read four integers (a1, a2, a3, a4) from input.\n\n2. Compute the maximum of a1*a3, a2*a4, a1*a4, a2*a3.\n\n3. Convert this maximum value to a string (S1).\n\n4. Process S1 through the second program's logic to get a score (integer).\n\n5. Convert the score to a string (S2).\n\n6. Process S2 through the third program's logic to get the final output (\"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- The four input numbers: let's use 64-bit integers. In Fortran, we can use integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18). Let's use integer(8).\n\n- The maximum product is also a 64-bit integer.\n\n- The string S1 is the string representation of the maximum product.\n\n- The score from the second step is an integer (since the second program's output is a number, which can be up to, say, the length of S1. Since S1 is the max product of two 64-bit numbers, which can be up to 1e18, so the string length is up to 18 digits. The score can be up to 18 (if all characters differ and contribute +1 each). So integer is sufficient.\n\n- The string S2 is the string representation of the score (so up to 3 digits, maybe).\n\nNow, step by step.\n\nFirst part: Read four integers.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger(8) :: a(4)\n\nread(*,*) a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4)\n\nWait, but in Java, the first program's array is 0-based (indices 0-3). In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit declaration. Alternatively, just use 1-based here. Since the code in Java uses a[0], a[1], etc., in Fortran, let's make the array 1-based, so a(1) to a(4).\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nlong[] a = new long[4]; for (int i=0; i<4; i++) a[i] = in.nextLong();\n\nSo in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so a(1) to a(4) correspond to the Java's a[0] to a[3].\n\nWait, no, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So a[0] is first element, a[3] is fourth. So in Fortran, if we have a(1) to a(4), then a(1) is the first input, which is the same as Java's a[0].\n\nSo the product terms:\n\nJava's a[0]*a[2] \u2192 in Fortran, a(1)*a(3).\n\nSimilarly, a[1]*a[3] \u2192 a(2)*a(4).\n\na[0]*a[3] \u2192 a(1)*a(4).\n\na[1]*a[2] \u2192 a(2)*a(3).\n\nSo the maximum is max(a(1)*a(3), a(2)*a(4), a(1)*a(4), a(2)*a(3)).\n\nCompute that and store in max_val.\n\nThen, convert max_val to a string S1.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write with an internal variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1\n\nwrite(s1, '(i0)') max_val\n\ntrim(s1) to remove leading spaces? Or perhaps just use the string as is.\n\nWait, the write statement will write the number as a string, but leading spaces may be present if the number is shorter than the field. So using '(i0)' is better, which uses the minimum width.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the format '(i0)' writes the integer in default format, without leading spaces. So that's okay.\n\nThen, process S1 through the second program's logic.\n\nSecond step: compute the score based on S1.\n\nThe string S1 is the input to the second program. So for each character in S1 (each character is a character in the string), we need to loop over each position (0-based in Java, but in Fortran, strings are 1-based).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to S.length()-1. So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the loop would be from 1 to len_trim(S1).\n\nFor each position i (1-based in Fortran, but the Java code uses 0-based), so in Fortran, the equivalent of Java's i is (i_fortran -1). So for each character in S1:\n\nmy_char is 'g' if (i_fortran -1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 i_fortran-1 even \u2192 i_fortran is odd (since 1-based). Wait, let's see:\n\nJava's i is 0-based. So for Fortran's i (1-based):\n\nJava's i = (Fortran's i -1).\n\nSo, if (Fortran's i -1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 then my_char is 'g', else 'p'.\n\nSo for each character in S1 (from 1 to len_trim(S1)), compute:\n\nmy_char = 'g' if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 i mod 2 ==1 \u2192 because (i-1) mod 2 is 0 when i is odd (since i-1 is even).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ni_fortran = 1 \u2192 Java's i=0 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'\n\ni_fortran =2 \u2192 Java's i=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 'p'\n\ni_fortran=3 \u2192 Java's i=2 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'\n\nYes, so the condition is: if (i_fortran -1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 which is equivalent to (i_fortran mod 2) ==1 \u2192 because (i_fortran-1) mod 2 is 0 when i_fortran is odd.\n\nSo for each character in S1:\n\nmy_char = 'g' if i_fortran is odd, else 'p'.\n\nThen, compare with the actual character (his_char = S1(i_fortran: i_fortran)).\n\nIf my_char /= his_char, then:\n\nif my_char is 'p' (i_fortran even \u2192 even in Fortran's terms?), then add 1 to score.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, my_char is 'g' when i_fortran is odd (Java's i even), and 'p' when even (Java's i odd).\n\nSo when my_char is 'g', then if his_char is different, then the contribution is -1.\n\nWhen my_char is 'p', then contribution is +1.\n\nSo the code in Fortran:\n\nscore =0\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(S1)\n\n    c = S1(i:i)\n\n    if (mod(i,2) ==1) then ! i_fortran is odd \u2192 my_char is 'g'\n\n        my_char = 'g'\n\n    else\n\n        my_char = 'p'\n\n    end if\n\n    if (c /= my_char) then\n\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n            score = score +1\n\n        else\n\n            score = score -1\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the second step.\n\nThen, the score is an integer. Now, convert that to a string S2.\n\nAgain, using write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2\n\nwrite(s2, '(i0)') score\n\nThen, process S2 through the third program's logic.\n\nThird step: process S2 (the string of the score) to determine \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nThe third program's logic is:\n\nCount the frequency of each character in S2.\n\nCompute the number of characters with odd counts (oddCount).\n\nif (oddCount <=1) or (oddCount is odd) \u2192 output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then \"First\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in S2.\n\nWe can use a character array or a hash map. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map, we can use an array for characters. Since characters can be any, but in S2 it's the string of the score, which is a number, so digits 0-9 and possibly a minus sign (if the score is negative? Wait, the second program's score can be negative?\n\nWait, the second program's score can be negative. For example, if all characters in S1 (the first program's output) are 'g' at even indices and 'p' at odd indices, but the actual characters are different. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose S1 is \"1234\".\n\nThen for each position (1-based):\n\ni=1 (Java's 0): my is 'g'. If the character is '1', which is not 'g', so my is 'g', so subtract 1.\n\ni=2 (Java's 1): my is 'p'. If the character is '2', not 'p', so add 1.\n\ni=3 (Java's 2): my is 'g'. If '3' != 'g', subtract 1.\n\ni=4 (Java's 3): my is 'p'. '4' != 'p', add 1.\n\nTotal: (-1) +1 + (-1) +1 \u2192 0.\n\nBut if the actual characters are all 'g's except where my is 'p', then the score can be negative.\n\nSo the score can be negative. So the string S2 can have a '-' sign. So the characters in S2 can be digits and '-'.\n\nThus, the third program's input is a string that may include '-' and digits.\n\nSo in Fortran, to count the frequency of each character in S2:\n\nWe can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) or use a hash map-like structure. Alternatively, since the possible characters are limited (digits 0-9, '-', and possibly others if the score is very large?), but let's assume only those.\n\nAlternatively, use a derived type or a dictionary. But in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to use an array for counts.\n\nLet's use an array of size 256 (for all ASCII characters). Initialize all to 0, then for each character in S2, increment the count for that ASCII code.\n\nThen, count how many of those counts are odd.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: counts = 0\n\ninteger :: oddCount =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2\n\n! after getting s2:\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(s2)\n\n    c = s2(i:i)\n\n    ich = ichar(c)\n\n    counts(ich) = counts(ich) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, loop over all counts to find how many are odd:\n\noddCount =0\n\ndo i=0,255\n\n    if (mod(counts(i),2) ==1) then\n\n        oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, check the condition:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) /=0) ) then\n\n    print *, 'First'\n\nelse\n\n    print *, 'Second'\n\nend if\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: a(4), max_val, product1, product2, product3, product4\n\n    character(len=20) :: s1, s2\n\n    integer :: score, oddCount, i, ich\n\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: counts = 0\n\n    !

For example, if max_val is 123, then the string would be '123', but if the field is larger, but using '(i0)' should write it without leading spaces. Let me confirm.\n\nIn Fortran, the format '(i0)' writes the integer in default format, which is the minimal width. So that's okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0 \u2192 s1 is \"0\".\n\nSecond program's processing: the string is \"0\".\n\nLength is 1. i=1 (odd \u2192 my_char 'g'). The character is '0' vs 'g' \u2192 different. So my_char is 'g', so subtract 1. So score is -1.\n\nThen s2 is \"-1\".\n\nProcessing s2: characters '-', '1'.\n\nCounts: '-' (ASCII 45) \u2192 count 1, '1' (ASCII 49) \u2192 count 1. So oddCount is 2 (both counts are 1, which are odd). \n\nSo condition: oddCount is 2 \u2192 which is even and >1 \u2192 so output \"Second\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\noddCount is 2 \u2192 (2 <=1 \u2192 no) and (mod(2,2) \u2192 0 \u2192 so condition is false. So the condition is (false OR false) \u2192 false \u2192 else \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 123 \u2192 s1 is \"123\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (my 'g') \u2192 char '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\ni=2 (my 'p') \u2192 char '2' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1.\n\ni=3 (my 'g') \u2192 '3' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\nTotal score: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 s2 is \"-1\".\n\nSame as before \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 1 \u2192 s1 is \"1\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 \u2192 my 'g' vs '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\ns2 is \"-1\".\n\nSame as before \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nAnother case where the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nSuppose the second program's score is 0 \u2192 s2 is \"0\".\n\nProcessing s2: only '0' \u2192 count is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1 \u2192 condition (1 <=1 \u2192 yes \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: score is 3 \u2192 s2 is \"3\".\n\nCharacters: '3' \u2192 count 1 \u2192 oddCount 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf score is 2 \u2192 s2 is \"2\" \u2192 count 1 \u2192 oddCount 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, no, if s2 is \"2\", then the count for '2' is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1 \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, but if the score is 2 \u2192 s2 is \"2\", so the count is 1 (odd). So yes, \"First\".\n\nAnother case: score is 12 \u2192 s2 is \"12\".\n\nCharacters '1' and '2' \u2192 counts 1 each \u2192 oddCount 2 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where the third program's input is \"aabb\" \u2192 but in our case, the input is the score's string, which is numeric and possibly with '-'.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, checking the code for possible issues.\n\nIn the second step, when converting max_val to s1, the write statement may have a trailing space if the length is less than 20. But since we use len_trim(s1), it should be okay.\n\nIn the third step, when processing s2, the loop runs over len_trim(s2), so it's okay.\n\nThe counts array is initialized to zero each time, so that's okay.\n\nThe variables are declared properly.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program should be as above. Let me write it properly with proper syntax.\n\nWait, in the second step, when processing s1, the loop over i from 1 to len_trim(s1). The character is s1(i:i).\n\nIn Fortran, the substring is s1(i:i).\n\nAlso, in the code, the variables are declared correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in the first step, the products are computed as a(1)*a(3), etc. Since a is integer(8), the products are also integer(8), but the max_val is also integer(8). So that's okay.\n\nThe score is an integer (since it's the result of adding/subtracting 1 multiple times). So declared as integer is okay.\n\nThe counts array is dimensioned from 0 to 255, which covers all ASCII characters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final code should be as written above."
