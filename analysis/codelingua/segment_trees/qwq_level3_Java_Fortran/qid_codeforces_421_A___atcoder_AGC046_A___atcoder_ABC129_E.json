Wait, in Fortran, the DP array is initialized to zero except dp(1,1)=1. So for the first part, when the character is '1', the first part sets dp[i+1][2] (the second column) to the sum, but leaves dp[i+1][1] (first column) as 0 (since it wasn't set in the first part).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_421_A) reads input: n, a, b, then a list of a integers, then a list of b integers. Then it loops through 1 to n, checking if each number is in the first list (list1). If yes, it prints 1, else 2. Wait, but the second part of the code in the first file only uses list1? The second list (list2) isn't used here. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake, but according to the code, the second loop for list2 is just reading but not used. So the output of the first program is a sequence of 1s and 2s for each number from 1 to n.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_AGC046_A) takes an integer x, and counts how many times you add x to itself modulo 360 until it reaches 360. Wait, the code initializes x as the input, then sets tmp = x, then x is set to 0. Then in a loop, x += tmp each time, mod 360, and increments count until x is 360. Wait, but when x reaches 360, the loop stops. So the count is the number of steps needed for the sum to reach exactly 360 modulo 360. Wait, but 360 mod 360 is 0. Wait, maybe the code has a mistake here. Let me see:\n\nThe loop condition is while x != 360. Wait, but when x is 360, the mod would set it to 0. Wait, the code's logic is a bit confusing. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\n- Read x (input from first program's output? Wait, no, the second program's input is the output of the first program. Wait, the first program outputs a sequence of numbers (the 1s and 2s). But the second program expects an integer x. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the original Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. But the first program outputs a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, which is a string. The second program expects an integer x. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem setup. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program, but the second program is expecting a single integer. That would be a problem unless the first program's output is a single integer. But looking at the first Java code, it's printing a sequence of 1s and 2s for each of the n numbers. So the output is a list of numbers, but the second program expects a single integer. That suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the second program is supposed to read the output of the first program as its input. But the first program's output is a sequence of numbers, which would be read as a single line by the second program. The second program's code uses FastReader.nextInt(), which would read the first integer from the input. But the first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. So the second program would read the first number (the first 1 or 2) as x, then process that. But that might not be the intended behavior. However, according to the problem statement, the user provided these three Java programs, and the task is to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that does the same. So I have to follow the given code's logic, even if there's a possible inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program's input is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a sequence of numbers (like 1 2 1 2 ...), so the second program's input is that entire line. The second program's code reads x as the first integer in that input. So the second program's x is the first number from the first program's output. Then the second program processes that x and outputs a count. Then the third program takes that count as input?\n\nWait, the third program's first line is reading a line (using nextLine()), which would be the output of the second program. The second program's output is a single integer (the count). So the third program reads that as a string, then converts to a char array. Wait, but the third program's code is expecting a string input (since it uses nextLine()), which would be the output of the second program (a single number). So the third program's input is that single number as a string. But then the code processes the characters of that string. For example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program's s would be the characters '5', so the length is 1, and the code would process that.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit odd, but I have to follow the code as given. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is a sequence of 1s and 2s (space-separated), which is the input to the second program. The second program reads the first integer (the first number in that sequence) as x, then computes the count. The second program's output is that count, which is then the input to the third program. The third program reads that count as a string (since it uses nextLine()), then processes each character in that string (the digits of the count) to compute some value.\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nInput to the entire sequence is the input to the first Java program. The first program's output is a list of numbers (1/2) for each of n numbers. The second program takes the first number of that list as x, computes the count, outputs that count. The third program takes that count as a string, processes it, and outputs the final result.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, without I/O in the middle steps. So the first part (equivalent to first Java program) reads the input, processes it, then passes data to the second part (second Java program's logic), which processes it without I/O, then passes to the third part (third Java program's logic), which finally outputs the result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read input (n, a, b, then a numbers, then b numbers). The first part's processing is to generate the sequence of 1s and 2s for 1 to n, checking if each is in list1 (the a numbers). The output of this first part is the first element of that sequence (since the second Java program takes the first number as x). Wait, no, the second program's x is the first number in the first program's output. So the first program's output is a list of numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. So in the Fortran program, after generating the entire sequence, we can just take the first element (the first number in the sequence) to pass to the second part.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a sequence of numbers for each of the n numbers. The second program reads the first integer from that output. So in the Fortran code, after generating the sequence, we can just take the first element (the first number in the sequence) as the x for the second part.\n\nThen, the second part's logic is to compute the count as per the second Java program. The result of that is the count, which is then passed to the third part. The third part's input is the count as a string (since the third Java program reads a line, which would be the count's string representation). So the third part in Fortran needs to take that count, convert it to a string, then process each character as per the third Java code.\n\nWait, but in the third Java program, the input is read via nextLine(), which would read the entire line. So the output of the second program is a single integer, which when printed, is a single line with that number. So the third program's input is that number as a string. So in Fortran, the third part will take the count (integer) from the second part, convert it to a string, then process each character.\n\nPutting this all together, the Fortran program will:\n\n- Read the input (n, a, b, then a numbers, then b numbers).\n\n- Process the first part to generate the sequence of 1s and 2s for 1 to n. The first element of this sequence is x for the second part.\n\n- Then, compute the count as per the second Java program's logic using x.\n\n- Then, convert the count to a string, process it as per the third Java program's logic, and output the final result.\n\nNow, let's break down each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (Java codeforces_421_A):\n\nThe first program reads n, a, b, then a numbers into list1, then b numbers into list2 (but list2 isn't used). The output is for each i from 1 to n, 1 if i is in list1, else 2. So in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read n, a, b.\n\n- Read a integers into an array (list1).\n\n- Read b integers into another array (but not use it).\n\n- For each i from 1 to n, check if i is present in list1. The first element of this sequence (i=1) is the x for the second part.\n\nWait, the first element is when i=1. So the first element is 1 if 1 is in list1, else 2. So the x is that first value.\n\nSecond part (Java atcoder_AGC046_A):\n\nThe second program takes x (the first element from first part's output), then:\n\nInitialize tmp = x, x is set to 0, count=0.\n\nLoop while x != 360:\n\n- x += tmp, then mod 360 (if over 360, subtract 360). But actually, adding tmp and then mod 360 would be the same as (x + tmp) mod 360. But the code does:\n\nx = x + tmp\n\nif x > 360, subtract 360. So effectively, x = mod(x + tmp, 360). But the loop continues until x is 360. Wait, but mod 360 would give 0 when x reaches 360. So the loop condition is while x != 360. Wait, but when x is 360, mod 360 would be 0, so the loop would continue until x is 0? That can't be right. Wait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nint x = sc.nextInt(); // x is the first number from first program's output (1 or 2?)\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the numbers are 1 or 2. So x is either 1 or 2. Then:\n\nint count =0;\n\nint tmp =x;\n\nx=0;\n\nthen loop while x !=360:\n\nx += tmp;\n\nif x>360, subtract 360 (so x becomes x-360, which is equivalent to mod 360 but negative? Wait, no. For example, if x was 361, subtract 360 gives 1. So effectively, x is (x + tmp) mod 360, but the code is doing it manually.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nx starts at 0.\n\nEach iteration adds tmp to x, then if x exceeds 360, subtract 360. So x is always in [0, 360). The loop continues until x equals 360. But since x can't be 360 (since after adding tmp, if it's over, it subtracts 360, so x is in 0-359). So the loop will never terminate? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code. Let me see:\n\nWait, the loop condition is while (x != 360). But after the first iteration, x is 0 + tmp (since x was set to 0). Then, if tmp is 1, then x becomes 1. Then next iteration adds 1 again, so 2, etc. The loop continues until x becomes 360. But since x is modded to stay under 360, the only way x can be 360 is if tmp divides 360 exactly. For example, if tmp is 360, then after one step, x would be 360, but then the code would subtract 360, making x 0 again. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's steps:\n\nInitialize x =0, tmp = original x (the input from first program).\n\ncount starts at 0.\n\nLoop while x !=360:\n\n- x += tmp \u2192 new x is 0 + tmp (first iteration)\n\n- if x>360 \u2192 subtract 360 \u2192 so x becomes (x mod 360)\n\n- count increases by 1.\n\nWait, but after the first iteration, x is tmp mod 360. Then next iteration adds tmp again, so x becomes (tmp + tmp) mod 360, etc. The loop continues until x equals 360. But since x is always modded to be less than 360, the only way x can be 360 is if the addition exactly reaches 360. For example, if tmp is 360, then first iteration:\n\nx =0 +360 \u2192 360 \u2192 since it's not greater than 360, so no subtraction. Then x is 360, so the loop condition (x !=360) is false \u2192 loop stops. So count is 1. So that works.\n\nAnother example: tmp is 180. Then:\n\nFirst iteration: x becomes 180 \u2192 count 1.\n\nSecond iteration: x +=180 \u2192 360 \u2192 which is not >360, so x remains 360 \u2192 loop condition is false \u2192 count is 2.\n\nWait, but in that case, the loop would stop after two steps. So the code works for cases where tmp divides 360 exactly. But if tmp is 1, then the loop would run until x reaches 360, which would take 360 steps. But since x is modded, after 360 steps, x would be 360 (since 1*360 = 360 \u2192 no subtraction). So the loop would stop. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code counts the number of steps needed to reach exactly 360 by adding tmp each time, modulo 360. The count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's logic is:\n\nInitialize tmp = x (the first element from first part's output)\n\nx =0\n\ncount =0\n\nloop:\n\n   x = x + tmp\n\n   if x >360 then x = x -360\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   if x ==360 then exit loop\n\nend loop\n\nthen the count is the result.\n\nThird part (Java atcoder_ABC129_E):\n\nThe third program reads a string (the output of the second program, which is the count as a string). Then processes it with a DP approach.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nchar[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();\n\nint n = s.length;\n\nint[][] dp = new int[n+1][2];\n\ndp[0][0] =1;\n\nThen loops over each character in s (digits of the count). The DP transitions are a bit complex. Let me parse the code:\n\nThe DP array has two states: 0 and 1. The transitions depend on the current character (s[i]).\n\nThe code's logic is:\n\nFor each position i (from 0 to n-1):\n\nIf the current character is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nElse (if it's '1'):\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, there's another block:\n\nIf the current character is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 then mod again.\n\nElse (if '1'):\n\n   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M\n\nWait, the code has some nested conditions. Let me re-express the code step by step.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i + 1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n    }\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i + 1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i + 1][0] %= M;\n\n        dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe first part of the loop (the first if-else) handles the first part of the transitions, and the second part (another if-else) adds more to the DP.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, for each character:\n\nIf the current character is '0', then:\n\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nElse:\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, regardless of the first condition, the second part checks again the same character.\n\nWait, the second part is another if-else on the same s[i].\n\nSo for the '0' case:\n\nFirst part sets dp[i+1][0] and [1] to previous values.\n\nThen, in the second part (since s[i] is '0'), it adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], then mod.\n\nSo the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1], then the second part adds 2*dp[i][1], so total becomes 3*dp[i][1]?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFirst part (s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nThen, in the second part (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so total becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1], mod M.\n\nThen mod again.\n\nWait, but the code does:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 but the mod is applied to the product before adding?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M \u2192 so the product is modded first, then added to the current value. Then mod again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is written that way to prevent overflow, but in Fortran, we can handle it with mod operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the order of operations is important.\n\nThis part is a bit tricky. Let me try to re-express the code's logic for each character:\n\nCase when s[i] is '0':\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M \u2192 so:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) \u2192 but mod M again.\n\nWait, but the code does:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (previous value) + ( (dp[i][1] *2) mod M )\n\nthen mod M again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is equivalent to:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + (dp[i][1] *2)) mod M\n\nBut the order of mod operations may vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is:\n\nAfter the first part, the second part adds 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1], then mod M.\n\nSo for '0' case:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][1] + 2 * dp[i][1]) mod M \u2192 3 * dp[i][1] mod M.\n\nFor the else part (s[i] is '1'):\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is '1'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2 mod M)\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2 mod M)\n\nthen mod both.\n\nSo:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = ( (dp[i][0] *2) mod M ) + (previous value from first part?)\n\nWait, the first part for '1' sets dp[i+1][0] to whatever? Wait, in the first part for '1', the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0? Or is there an implicit initialization?\n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is initialized to 0. So in the first part, for '1', the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0. Then in the second part (else clause for '1'), the code adds to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, let me re-express the code step by step for '1' case:\n\nFirst part (s[i] is '1'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\ndp[i+1][0] remains 0 (since it's not set here).\n\nSecond part (else clause for '1'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2 mod M) \u2192 so becomes (0 + (dp[i][0] *2 mod M)) mod M.\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) \u2192 so becomes ( (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) mod M + (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) ) mod M.\n\nThen both are modded again.\n\nWait, but the code does:\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 but the mod is applied to the product before adding. So the addition is done modulo M?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is written that way to prevent overflow, but in Fortran, we can compute the terms properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is equivalent to:\n\nFor '1' case:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = ( (dp[i][0] * 2) ) mod M\n\ndp[i+1][1] = ( (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) + (dp[i][1] * 2) ) mod M\n\nWait, but the first part's dp[i+1][1] is (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, then adding (dp[i][1] *2 mod M) to it. So total is (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1]) mod M \u2192 (dp[i][0] + 3*dp[i][1]) mod M.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. To avoid mistakes, perhaps I should re-express the code's logic in pseudocode.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's DP is counting something related to binary strings with certain constraints, but I need to translate the code as is.\n\nIn any case, the third part in Fortran will need to:\n\n- Take the count (integer from second part) and convert it to a string (since the third program reads it as a line).\n\n- Then process each character in that string (digits) through the DP array.\n\n- The DP has two states, and transitions as per the code.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n1. Read the input (n, a, b, then a numbers, then b numbers).\n\n2. Process the first part to generate the sequence of 1s and 2s for 1 to n. The first element (i=1) is x.\n\n3. Compute the count via the second part's logic.\n\n4. Convert count to a string, then process via the third part's DP.\n\nFinally, output the result of the third part.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures and steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n, a, b.\n\nThen read a integers into an array (list1). The list2 is read but not used, so we can just read and ignore.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nCheck if i is present in list1. The first element (i=1) is x.\n\nTo check if i is in list1, in Fortran, we can loop through the list1 array each time. Since a can be up to, say, n (but the problem doesn't specify constraints, but in codeforces problems, usually manageable sizes).\n\nAlternatively, for efficiency, we can create a logical array (present) of size n, initialized to .false., then mark the elements in list1 as .true.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\n- Read n, a, b.\n\n- Read a integers into list1 array (size a).\n\n- Create a logical array present(1:n), initialized to .false.\n\n- For each element in list1, mark present(element) = .true.\n\n- The first element of the sequence is 1 if present(1), else 2 \u2192 x = 1 or 2.\n\nSecond part:\n\nCompute count as per the loop.\n\nInitialize tmp = x, x =0, count=0.\n\nLoop:\n\n   x = x + tmp\n\n   if x > 360 then x = x - 360\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   if x == 360 then exit loop\n\nRepeat until x is 360.\n\nThird part:\n\nConvert count to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a character variable.\n\nThen, process the string's characters (each digit) as the s array.\n\nInitialize DP arrays. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the code uses 0-based indices. So perhaps we can use 1-based arrays with adjustments.\n\nThe DP array is (n+1) rows (since from 0 to n) and 2 columns (0 and 1). Let's make it 1-based in Fortran, so dp(1 to n+1, 1 to 2).\n\nInitialize dp(1,1) =1, dp(1,2)=0 (since in Java, dp[0][0] =1, others 0).\n\nWait, in Java, dp is initialized as dp[0][0] =1, and the rest 0. So in Fortran, dp(1,1) =1, dp(1,2)=0.\n\nThen loop over each character in the string (length is len_trim(s_str)), let's say length is m.\n\nFor each i from 1 to m (current character is s_str(i:i)):\n\n   current_char = s_str(i:i)\n\n   if current_char == '0' then:\n\n      dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)  ! dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n      dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)  ! dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n      ! Then the second part for '0' case:\n\n      temp = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n\n      dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp) mod M\n\n   else:\n\n      ! first part for '1' case:\n\n      temp = (dp(i,1) + dp(i,2)) mod M\n\n      dp(i+1,2) = temp\n\n      ! second part for '1' case:\n\n      temp0 = (dp(i,1) * 2) mod M\n\n      temp1 = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n\n      dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + temp0) mod M\n\n      dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp1) mod M\n\n      ! Then mod again:\n\n      dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1), M)\n\n      dp(i+1,2) = mod(dp(i+1,2), M)\n\n   end if\n\nWait, but need to track the order of operations correctly.\n\nAlternatively, let's re-express the code step by step for each character.\n\nLet me re-express the Java code's logic for each character:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1 (Java's loop):\n\ncurrent_char = s[i]\n\nFirst part:\n\nif current_char is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nSecond part:\n\nif current_char is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M \u2192 then mod again.\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M \u2192 then mod both.\n\nSo in Fortran terms, for each step (i from 1 to m):\n\ncurrent_char = s_str(i:i)\n\nFirst part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n   dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n\nelse:\n\n   temp = (dp(i,1) + dp(i,2)) mod M\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = temp\n\nend if\n\nSecond part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n   temp = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp) mod M\n\nelse:\n\n   temp0 = (dp(i,1) * 2) mod M\n\n   temp1 = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n\n   dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + temp0) mod M\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp1) mod M\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the else case of the first part, the first part sets dp[i+1][1] (the second column) to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, and leaves dp[i+1][0] (first column) as 0 (since it's initialized to 0 in Java, but in Fortran, we need to track that).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the DP array is initialized to zero except dp(1,1)=1. So for the first part, when the character is '1', the first part sets dp[i+1][2] (the second column) to the sum, but leaves dp[i+1][1] (first column) as 0 (since it wasn't set in the first part). Then in the second part, the else clause adds to dp[i+1][1] (first column) and dp[i+1][2] (second column).\n\nHmm, this requires careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, the DP array should be initialized to zero, and then the first part sets the values, then the second part adds to them.\n\nWait, let me think of the first part as:\n\nFor the first part (the first if-else):\n\n- For '0', set both columns to previous values.\n\n- For '1', set the second column to the sum, and leave first column as 0 (since it's not set).\n\nThen, in the second part (the second if-else):\n\n- For '0', add to the second column.\n\n- For '1', add to both columns.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nFirst part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n   dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n\nelse\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\n\nend if\n\nSecond part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n   temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\n\nelse\n\n   temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n\n   temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n\n   dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n\n   dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n\nend if\n\nThis should handle the transitions correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- For the first part:\n\n   n, a, b: integers.\n\n   list1: array of a integers.\n\n   present: logical array of size n (since numbers are from 1 to n).\n\n   x: integer (the first element of the sequence).\n\n- Second part variables:\n\n   tmp, x (initialized to 0), count.\n\n- Third part variables:\n\n   count_str: character string to hold the count as a string.\n\n   s_str: the string from count_str.\n\n   m: length of s_str.\n\n   dp: integer array (dimension (m+1, 2)), with modulo M = 1e9+7.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\n   integer :: n, a, b, i, j, tmp, x, count, current_char_ascii, current_char\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list1\n\n   logical, dimension(:), allocatable :: present\n\n   character(len=20) :: count_str\n\n   character(len=20) :: s_str\n\n   integer :: m\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\n   !

So for m characters, the indices go from 0 to m. The loop runs from i=1 to m (since the first character is s_str(1:1), which is the first character of the string, corresponding to i=1 in the loop, which would be the first element after 0).\n\nWait, let me check the indices again.\n\nIn the third part:\n\nThe string s_str has length m. The characters are s_str(1) to s_str(m).\n\nIn the Java code, the loop runs from i=0 to n-1 (since n is the length). So in Fortran, for each character at position i (1-based in the string), the loop index in the code is i from 1 to m (the length). The DP array is 0-based in Java (0 to m), so in Fortran, I can make it 0 to m (so size (m+1, 2)).\n\nThus, for each i from 1 to m (the current character is the i-th in the string), the code processes it as follows:\n\nThe first part of the loop (Java's first if-else) sets dp[i][...] based on dp[i-1][...].\n\nThen the second part adds to dp[i][...] based on the same character.\n\nThus, the code in the third part is correct as written.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop is:\n\ndo i =1, m\n\n   current_char is s_str(i:i)\n\n   first part (Java's first if-else):\n\n      if '0', set dp(i,1) and dp(i,2) to previous values (dp(i-1,1) and dp(i-1,2))\n\n      else, set dp(i,2) to (sum mod M)\n\n   then second part:\n\n      if '0', add to dp(i,2)\n\n      else, add to dp(i,1) and dp(i,2)\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the count is 0 (but in the second part, count can't be zero because the loop runs until x reaches 360, so count is at least 1? Let's see:\n\nIf x is 360, then tmp is 360. Then:\n\nx starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx += tmp \u2192 360 \u2192 not >360 \u2192 x is 360 \u2192 count becomes 1. The loop exits. So count is 1.\n\nThus, the count is always at least 1.\n\nThus, the string will have at least one character.\n\nAnother test case: count is 5 \u2192 s_str is '5', m=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\ndp(0,1)=1, others 0.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_char is '5' \u2192 which is '1'? No, '5' is ASCII different from '0' or '1'? Wait, the third program's input is the count as a string. Wait, the second program outputs the count as an integer, which is printed with System.out.println(count). So the output is the count as a number, e.g., 5 \u2192 the string is \"5\".\n\nBut in the third program's code, the characters are processed as the digits of the count. So if the count is 5, the string is \"5\", so the character is '5', which is not '0' or '1'. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the third Java program's code is expecting the input to be a string of '0's and '1's? Or any characters?\n\nLooking back at the third Java program's code:\n\nThe third program's code is:\n\nchar[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();\n\nThen processes each character. The code's logic depends on whether the character is '0' or '1'. So if the input is a number like 5, the characters are '5', which is neither '0' nor '1', so the code would treat it as '1' (since the first part's else clause is for '1'?), but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the code again:\n\nIn the third Java program's code:\n\nThe first part's if is if (s[i] == '0'), else it's for any other character (including '1', '2', etc). But the code's logic is written for '0' and '1' cases. So if the input has other characters, the code would treat them as '1's, but that's not correct. However, according to the problem's setup, the second program's output is the count, which is an integer. So the third program's input is the string representation of that count, which can have digits 0-9. But the code's logic is only handling '0' and '1' characters. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem's setup, but since the user provided the code as is, I have to follow it.\n\nWait, the third Java program's code is from atcoder_ABC129_E, which is a problem about binary strings. So perhaps the input to the third program should be a binary string (composed of '0's and '1's). But according to the sequence, the second program's output is an integer count, which when converted to a string may have other digits. This implies that there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but since the user provided the code, I have to proceed as per the code.\n\nThus, in the third part's code, any character that is not '0' will be treated as '1' in the first part's else clause, and in the second part's else clause. So for example, if the count is 5, the string is \"5\", so the character is '5', which is not '0', so first part treats it as '1', and second part also treats it as '1'.\n\nThus, the code will process it as if the input was '1'.\n\nThis is a problem in the code's logic, but since the user provided the code, I have to proceed.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the third part will process the characters as per their ASCII values, comparing to '0' and '1'.\n\nNow, in the code above, the current_char_ascii is compared to ichar('0') and ichar('1').\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, the second part's else clause is for when the character is not '0', but in the code, the second part's else is only triggered when the character is not '0' (i.e., any other character, including '1', '2', etc). So the code will treat any non-'0' character as '1' in the first part's else clause, and in the second part's else clause.\n\nThus, the code is correct as per the given Java code.\n\nNow, compiling all this into Fortran code.\n\nWait, in the third part's code, the variables temp, temp0, temp1 are needed. In Fortran, I need to declare them as integers.\n\nAlso, in the code above, I used variables temp, temp0, temp1 without declaring them. Need to add declarations.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nInside the third part's loop:\n\ndeclare temp, temp0, temp1 as integers.\n\nSo, inside the loop:\n\ninteger :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So perhaps declare them before the loop.\n\nAlternatively, inside the loop:\n\n   if (current_char_ascii == ichar('0')) then\n\n      ...\n\n   else\n\n      ...\n\n   end if\n\n   ! second part\n\n   if (current_char_ascii == ichar('0')) then\n\n      temp = mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\n      dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + temp, M )\n\n   else\n\n      temp0 = mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M )\n\n      temp1 = mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + temp0, M )\n\n      dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + temp1, M )\n\n   end if\n\nThus, variables temp, temp0, temp1 are needed. So in the code, before the loop, declare them:\n\ninteger :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared at the beginning of the scope. So inside the program, after declarations:\n\n   integer :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nBut then, inside the loop, they can be used.\n\nAlternatively, declare them inside the loop, but in Fortran 90, you can declare variables inside blocks.\n\nAlternatively, just use them without declaring, but that's bad practice. So better to declare them.\n\nThus, the code would have:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\n   integer :: n, a, b, i, j, tmp, x, count, current_char_ascii\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list1\n\n   logical, dimension(:), allocatable :: present\n\n   character(len=20) :: count_str\n\n   character(len=20) :: s_str\n\n   integer :: m\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\n   integer :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\n   ! Read first part's input\n\n   read*, n, a, b\n\n   allocate(list1(a))\n\n   read*, list1(1:a)\n\n   allocate(present(n))\n\n   present = .false.\n\n   do i =1, a\n\n      present(list1(i)) = .true.\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Determine x (first element of the sequence)\n\n   if (present(1)) then\n\n      x =1\n\n   else\n\n      x =2\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Second part: compute count\n\n   tmp = x\n\n   x =0\n\n   count =0\n\n   do\n\n      x = x + tmp\n\n      if (x > 360) then\n\n         x = x - 360\n\n      end if\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      if (x == 360) exit\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Third part: process count as string\n\n   ! Convert count to string\n\n   write(count_str, '(i0)') count\n\n   s_str = trim(count_str)\n\n   m = len_trim(s_str)\n\n   allocate(dp(0:m, 1:2)) ! since in Java it's 0-based, but Fortran can use 0 to m.\n\n   dp = 0\n\n   dp(0,1) =1\n\n   do i =1, m\n\n      current_char_ascii = ichar(s_str(i:i))\n\n      if (current_char_ascii == ichar('0')) then\n\n         ! first part: '0'\n\n         dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n         dp(i,2) = dp(i-1,2)\n\n      else\n\n         ! '1' or other characters treated as '1'\n\n         dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i-1,1) + dp(i-1,2), M )\n\n      end if\n\n      ! second part\n\n      if (current_char_ascii == ichar('0')) then\n\n         ! add to second column\n\n         temp = mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\n         dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + temp, M )\n\n      else\n\n         ! add to first and second columns\n\n         temp0 = mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, M )\n\n         temp1 = mod( dp(i-1,2)*2, M )\n\n         dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + temp0, M )\n\n         dp(i,2) = mod( dp(i,2) + temp1, M )\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! The result is (dp(m,1) + dp(m,2)) mod M\n\n   print*, mod( dp(m,1) + dp(m,2), M )\n\n   deallocate(list1, present, dp)\n\nend program main\n\nThis should be the correct code.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The present array is of size n, but what if the list1 contains numbers outside 1..n? The Java code would still process them, but in the first part's check for present(1), it would be false if 1 is not in list1. So the code handles that correctly.\n\n- The second part's loop: the loop continues until x reaches 360. Since x is modded to stay below 360, the only way to exit is if adding tmp brings x exactly to 360. So the loop will terminate only if tmp divides 360 exactly after some steps. But since tmp is either 1 or 2 (from the first part's x being 1 or 2), let's see:\n\nIf x is 1:\n\ntmp =1.\n\nx starts at 0.\n\nEach step adds 1. After 360 steps, x becomes 360 \u2192 loop exits. count is 360.\n\nIf x is 2:\n\ntmp=2.\n\nAfter 180 steps: 2*180 = 360 \u2192 count is 180.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\n- The third part's DP array is initialized correctly. The first element (dp(0,1)=1) is correct.\n\n- The modulo operations are applied correctly.\n\nThus, this should be the correct Fortran code."
