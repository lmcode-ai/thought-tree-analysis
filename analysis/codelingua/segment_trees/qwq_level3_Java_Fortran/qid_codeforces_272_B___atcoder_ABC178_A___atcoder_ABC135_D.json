    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_272_B) reads an integer n, then n numbers. For each number, it calls a recursive function (though it's not actually recursive, just a loop) to count the set bits. It increments an array a at the index corresponding to the count. Then it calculates some summation and outputs the result as a long.\n\nWait, the rec function is named 'rec' but it's not recursive. It loops through bits from 31 down to 0, counting how many bits are set. So for a given x, it returns the number of set bits. So the array a is counting how many numbers have 1 set bit, 2 set bits, etc., up to 32 bits (since the array is size 33, indexes 0 to 32).\n\nThen, the summation part: for each a[i], the formula is (1 + (a[i]-1))/2 * (a[i]-1). That's the sum of 1+2+...+(a[i]-1), which is the same as (a[i]-1)*a[i]/2. Wait, because sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. Wait, here it's (1 + (a[i]-1)) * (a[i]-1)/2.0. So that's the sum of 1 to (a[i]-1). So the total answer is the sum over all a[i] of (a[i]-1)*a[i]/2. So the first program's output is this sum.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer x, checks if it's 1, then outputs 0 if it is, else 1. Wait, the code is a bit convoluted. Let me see: bool is true if x is 1, then result is !bool ? 1 : 0. So if x is 1, result is 0, else 1. So the output is 1 - x (since x is 0 or 1? Wait, no, x can be any integer. Wait, the problem might be from a competition where x is between 0 and 1, but the code just checks if it's 1. So the second program's output is 0 if input is 1, else 1.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string of characters, which can be digits or '?', and computes some DP to find the number of ways to replace '?' with digits so that the number mod 13 is 5. The DP uses a modulus and tracks possible remainders. The final output is the value at dp[length-1][5], modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the original setup is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Wait, but the second program expects an integer x, so the first program's output must be an integer that is passed as input to the second. Then the second's output (0 or 1) is the input to the third program, which expects a string (since it reads a next() which is a string, but in the code, it's parsed as a char array. Wait, the third program's input is a single line which is a string (possibly with ? and digits). Wait, the third program's code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token, but in the problem statement for ABC135_D, the input is a single string. So the third program's input is a string, but the second program's output is a single integer (0 or 1). So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the third program, which expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the second program expects an integer x, so the first program's output must be that integer. The second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string (like a number with ?), but the second's output is a single integer. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a single integer (0 or 1). But the third program's code reads a string, which would be \"0\" or \"1\", but then processes it as a char array. Let me check the third program's code:\n\nIn the third program, the code is:\n\nchar[] cs = sc.next().toCharArray();\n\nSo the input is a single token (since next() is used), which is a string. So if the second program outputs, say, 0, then the third program's input is \"0\", so the char array would be ['0'], and the code would process that. So the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is a single integer (0 or 1). So the third program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nWait, but the third program's problem (ABC135_D) is about a string with ? and digits. So perhaps the original sequence is not correct? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Hmm, but the user says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the three Java programs are to be run in sequence, with each's output as next's input, and the final Fortran program must do all steps in one go.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input that the first Java program reads, process all three steps, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for first Java program (n and n numbers).\n\n2. Process first Java program's logic (count set bits, compute the sum).\n\n3. Take that result (the first program's output) as input to the second Java program (so the second program's input is that number).\n\n4. The second program outputs 0 or 1 based on whether that number is 1.\n\n5. Take that 0 or 1 as input to the third program, which treats it as a string (like \"0\" or \"1\"), and processes it through its DP.\n\n6. The final output is the third program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (n and n integers).\n\n- Compute the first program's output (the sum).\n\n- Use that as input to the second program's logic (output 0 or 1).\n\n- Use that result as input to the third program's logic (processing the string \"0\" or \"1\" through the DP).\n\n- Output the third program's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must combine all three steps into one, without I/O in between.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first step: read n and the n numbers. Then compute the array a (count of set bits for each number). Then compute the sum as per the first program.\n\nSecond step: take the first program's output (the sum) and compute the second program's result (0 if sum is 1, else 1). Wait, no: the second program's input is the first's output. The first program's output is the answer variable, which is a double, but cast to a long (so integer). So the second program's input is that integer. So the second program's code is:\n\nx = first's output (integer). Then result is 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nThird step: take the second's result (0 or 1) as a string (like \"0\" or \"1\"), then process through the third program's logic.\n\nWait, the third program's input is a string, so the second's output (0 or 1) is written as a string. So in the Fortran program, the second's output is an integer (0 or 1), which is then converted to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") to be the input to the third step's processing.\n\nSo the third step's processing is done on the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nNow, the third program's code is a DP problem. Let me understand it.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe input is a string (like \"0\" or \"1\"), converted to a char array. The code processes each character from the end (since it's processed in reverse order, as the loop uses cs.length -1 -i). The DP array is of size [length][13], tracking the number of ways to have a certain remainder mod 13 at each step.\n\nThe base variable starts at 1 and is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each step. The DP transitions depend on whether the current character is '?' (then try all digits 0-9) or a specific digit.\n\nWait, the loop in the third program is for i from 0 to cs.length-1. Wait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n    if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') { ... }\n\n}\n\nWait, the index is cs.length -1 -i. So for i=0, it's the last character, then i=1 is the second last, etc. So the processing is done from the end of the string towards the start. The base variable is initially 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 13. So base represents 10^i mod 13, where i is the current step (but maybe the indices are a bit tricky here).\n\nThe DP[i][...] represents the state after processing the first i+1 characters (from the end). The DP transitions are a bit complex, but the key is to model the possible remainders mod 13 as we build the number digit by digit, considering the current digit's possibilities.\n\nIn the Fortran code, I need to implement this DP for the input string (either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the n integers.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (sum over (a[i]-1)*a[i]/2).\n\n3. Compute the second program's result (0 if first's result is 1, else 1).\n\n4. Convert the second's result to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\").\n\n5. Process this string through the third program's DP.\n\n6. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about the variables and data structures needed in Fortran.\n\nFirst, for the first part:\n\n- Read n, then n integers. For each, count the set bits (number of 1s in binary).\n\n- The array a is of size 33 (indices 0 to 32). Initialize all to 0.\n\n- For each number, compute the count of set bits (like the rec function in Java).\n\n- Then compute the sum as sum over i of (a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2).\n\nSecond part: the second program's result is 0 if the first's output is 1, else 1.\n\nThird part: the third program's processing.\n\nThe third part's input is a string of length 1 (either \"0\" or \"1\"). Let's see:\n\nThe string is either \"0\" or \"1\". So the char array will have one character. The code in the third program processes each character in reverse order (since the loop uses cs.length -1 -i, starting from i=0 to length-1). For a length 1 string, the first (and only) character is processed when i=0, so the character is at position 0 (since cs.length-1 -0 =0).\n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be a 2D array. Let's see:\n\nThe DP array in Java is declared as long[cs.length][13]. Since the input is length 1, the array will be 1x13. The MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. For length 1, the loop runs once (i from 0 to 0). The base is initially 1, then after the first step, it becomes 10 mod13, but since the loop is only once, maybe the base is handled correctly.\n\nWait, in the third program's code:\n\nbase is initialized to 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to cs.length-1:\n\n    process the character at position (cs.length-1 -i)\n\n    then, after processing, base is updated to base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, the base is updated after each step. So for the first step (i=0), the base is 1, then after processing, it becomes 10 mod13 (10). For the next step (if there were more), it would be 100 mod13, etc.\n\nBut in our case, the input is length 1, so the loop runs once. The base starts at 1, and after processing, it becomes 10 mod13, but that's not used again.\n\nThe DP array for the third step:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array. Since the input is length 1, the first dimension is 1. The second dimension is 13.\n\nInitially, for i=0 (the first step, processing the first character from the end, which is the only character):\n\nIf the character is '?', then for each previous remainder (pre from 0 to 12), and for each possible next digit (0-9), we add to the new remainder ( (base * next + pre) mod13 ), the value from the previous step (dp[i-1][pre], but since i=0, it's the first step, so i-1 is -1, so the initial condition is (pre ==0 ? 1 :0).\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor the first step (i=0):\n\nif the character is '?', then for each pre in 0..12:\n\nfor next in 0..9:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) mod13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\nmod MOD.\n\nSince i=0, the term is (pre==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for the first step, the initial value is 1 when pre is 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each possible next digit (0-9), the new remainder is (base * next + 0) mod13 (since pre is 0 initially?), but wait, the pre loops over all possible previous remainders. Wait, the code loops over all pre from 0 to 12, and for each, and for each next digit, adds to the new remainder.\n\nWait, the initial state before any steps is that the remainder is 0 (since the initial condition is pre==0 gives 1). So for the first step, the previous step (i-1 = -1) is considered as having 1 way if pre is 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each pre in 0..12, the previous count is 1 if pre is 0, else 0.\n\nTherefore, for the first step (i=0), the code is processing the first character (the only one), and for each possible previous remainder (pre), but since it's the first step, the previous is only possible if pre was 0 (since the initial state is 0).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think through an example.\n\nSuppose the input is \"0\".\n\nThen the character is '0', so it's not a '?'. So in the loop for i=0:\n\ncs[0] (since length is 1, so cs.length-1 -0 =0) is '0'.\n\nSo next is 0 (since '0' - '0' is 0).\n\nThen, for each pre from 0 to 12:\n\ndp[0][(base * next + pre) mod13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0)).\n\nSince i=0, the term is (pre==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for each pre, if pre is 0, then the term is 1, else 0.\n\nSo for each pre, the contribution is only when pre is 0.\n\nSo for pre=0:\n\nnext is 0, base is 1.\n\nSo (1 *0 +0) mod13 =0 mod13 =0.\n\nSo dp[0][0] += 1 (from pre=0).\n\nOther pre values (1-12) contribute nothing.\n\nThus, after processing, dp[0][0] is 1, others are 0.\n\nThen, the final result is dp[0][5], which is 0. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, but the input is \"0\", so the number is 0. The mod 13 of 0 is 0, so the remainder is 0, not 5. So the output is 0, which matches.\n\nAnother example: input is \"1\".\n\nThen the character is '1', so next is 1.\n\nbase is 1.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\n(1*1 +0) mod13 =1 mod13 =1 \u2192 so dp[0][1] +=1.\n\nOther pre's don't contribute. So dp[0][5] is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the mod 13 of the number to be 5. So for input \"5\", the output would be 1. But in our case, the input is either \"0\" or \"1\", so the output would be 0 in both cases. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the third program's code outputs dp[dp.length-1][5]. Since the length is 1, dp.length-1 is 0. So the final value is dp[0][5]. For input \"0\", that's 0. For input \"1\", also 0. So the third program's output would be 0 in both cases. But perhaps the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is 0 or 1, so the third program's input is \"0\" or \"1\", leading to output 0 in both cases. But maybe I need to check the code again.\n\nWait, the third program's code is for a problem where the input is a string with ? and digits, and the output is the number of ways to replace ? with digits so that the number mod13 is 5. So for input \"0\", the only possible number is 0, which mod13 is 0, so 0 ways. For input \"1\", same, mod13 is 1, so 0 ways. So the output would be 0 in both cases. So the final output of the entire sequence would be 0, regardless of the first program's output (as long as it's not 5, but the second program's output is 0 or 1, leading to third's output 0).\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the third program's processing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the third program's code uses base which is initially 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod13. The base represents 10^i mod13, where i is the current step's position. Wait, perhaps the base is 10^i mod13, where i is the number of digits processed so far?\n\nAlternatively, the base is 10^i mod13, where i is the current step. Let me see:\n\nInitially, base is 1 (10^0 mod13 is 1).\n\nAfter first step (i=0), base becomes 10 mod13 (10^1 mod13).\n\nAfter second step (i=1), base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9 (since 13*7=91, 100-91=9).\n\nWait, but in the code, the base is updated after processing each step. So for each i, after processing the ith step, base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\nbase = base *10 %13;\n\nSo after processing the ith step (the loop for i from 0 to length-1), the base is updated. So for the first step (i=0), after processing, base becomes 10 mod13. For the next step (i=1), it becomes 10*10 mod13, etc.\n\nIn the case of a single character, after processing, the base is 10 mod13, but that's not used again.\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each step i (processing the ith character from the end), the current digit is either fixed or can be 0-9 (if it's a '?'). The contribution to the remainder is (digit * base + previous remainder) mod13.\n\nWait, the formula is (base * next + pre) mod13. Wait, the next digit is multiplied by the current base, then added to the previous remainder. So the base is 10^i mod13, where i is the number of digits processed so far? Not sure, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nIn any case, the third program's processing for input \"0\" or \"1\" will result in 0, so the final output is 0.\n\nBut perhaps I need to code this correctly in Fortran.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and n integers. For each integer, count the set bits.\n\nIn Fortran, to count the number of set bits in an integer, we can loop through the bits. Since Java's rec function uses a loop from 31 downto 0, but in Fortran, integers can be 32-bit or 64-bit, but the problem's first program uses a long for x, so perhaps the numbers can be up to 2^63-1? Wait, the first Java program's rec function takes a long x, but in the code, the input is sc.nextInt(), which is an int. So the numbers are 32-bit integers. So in Fortran, we can read them as integers (assuming 32-bit).\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the numbers are read via sc.nextInt(), so they are 32-bit integers. So in Fortran, we can read them as integers (4 bytes). The function rec is passed a long, but the input is an int, so the maximum is 2^31-1. The rec function counts the set bits in the binary representation of x. So for each number, we can count the bits.\n\nIn Fortran, to count the set bits of an integer, we can loop through each bit. Let's write a function:\n\nFUNCTION count_bits(x) RESULT(cnt)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: x\n  INTEGER :: cnt, i, mask\n  cnt = 0\n  DO i = 0, 31  ! since it's 32 bits\n    mask = 1\n    mask = mask << i\n    IF (BTEST(x, i)) THEN\n      cnt = cnt + 1\n    END IF\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the bits are stored as two's complement, but for positive numbers, the bit count is straightforward. Since the input numbers are from nextInt(), which can be negative? Wait, the problem may not have negative numbers, but the code in Java uses nextInt(), so if the input is negative, the rec function would count the set bits in the two's complement form. However, the problem's first program may be designed for non-negative numbers. But to be safe, perhaps the function should count the number of set bits in the absolute value? Or maybe the problem expects the count of set bits in the binary representation of the number as an unsigned integer. Hmm, but the original Java code's rec function uses (x & (1 <<k)) !=0. Since in Java, integers are signed, but shifting 1 <<31 would be okay for 32-bit. Wait, in Java, for a long x, the code loops from 31 downto 0, so for each bit from 31 to 0, checks if the bit is set. So for a negative number, the higher bits (like 31) would be 1. So the function counts all set bits in the 32-bit representation (since it's looping up to 31). So in Fortran, to replicate this, we can treat the integer as a 32-bit two's complement, and count the set bits in all 32 bits. So for a negative number, the sign bit (31st bit) is set, so it would be counted.\n\nThus, the function in Fortran can loop from 0 to 31, and count the bits set in each position.\n\nNow, the array a is of size 33 (indices 0 to 32). So in Fortran, we can declare it as an integer array of size 33, initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for each number, compute the count, and increment a(count).\n\nThen compute the sum over all a(i) of (a(i)*(a(i)-1)/2).\n\nSecond part: the second program's result is 0 if the first's output is 1, else 1.\n\nThird part: the third program's input is the string representation of the second's result (either \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nNow, the third part's processing:\n\nThe input string is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nThe code for the third program's DP:\n\nWe need to model the DP array. Let's see:\n\nThe length of the string is 1. So the DP array is 1 x 13.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (length, 13). Since length is 1, it's 1 row.\n\nThe base starts at 1.\n\nLoop over each character (i from 0 to length-1):\n\n   current_char = the ith character from the end (since the code uses cs.length-1 -i).\n\n   if current_char is '?', then loop over next 0-9.\n\n   else, next is the digit value.\n\n   for each pre in 0..12:\n\n      new_remainder = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n      dp[i][new_remainder] += previous value (from dp[i-1][pre] if i>0 else 1 if pre==0 else 0)\n\n      mod MOD.\n\n   then, after processing, base *=10 mod13.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with the appropriate declarations.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based indices but adjust the loops.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based arrays. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, to have 0-based arrays, we can declare them with lower bound 0.\n\nSo for the DP array:\n\ninteger, dimension(0: len-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nBut in our case, the length is 1, so 0:0 for the first dimension.\n\nWait, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the input string is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nLet's process the string:\n\nThe string is stored as a character array. Let's say the input is stored in a character array s of length 1.\n\nThen, the loop in the third program's code is for i from 0 to len-1 (since len is 1, i=0).\n\nFor each i:\n\ncurrent_char is s(len-1 -i) \u2192 since len is 1, len-1 -i = 0 -0 =0 \u2192 so the first character.\n\nSo for the first step (i=0):\n\ncurrent_char is s(0) (assuming 0-based).\n\nThen, if it's '?', process all digits 0-9, else use the digit.\n\nThen, for each pre in 0 to 12:\n\n   if it's '?', loop next from 0 to9:\n\n      new_remainder = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n      dp[i][new_remainder] = dp[i][new_remainder] + (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (1 if pre ==0 else 0))\n\n   else:\n\n      next = digit value (e.g., 0 or 1)\n\n      new_remainder = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n      dp[i][new_remainder] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n   then mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to zero, so we need to handle the initial conditions properly.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, the input string is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nLet's say the second program's output is stored in a variable second_result (0 or 1). The third program's input is the string representation of this, so we can create a character array s of length 1:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s\n\ns = char(ichar('0') + second_result)\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a character, we can use ichar and char functions. For example, if second_result is 0, then s would be '0', else '1'.\n\nThen, the length is 1.\n\nNow, the DP array:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:0, 0:12) :: dp\n\nBut in Fortran, we can declare it as:\n\ninteger, dimension(1:1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nWait, perhaps better to use 1-based for the first dimension. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of the first dimension as 1-based (from 1 to length). So for length 1, it's 1.\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nThen, base =1.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to length (since in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to len-1, but in Fortran, we can adjust indices).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use 0-based indices for the first dimension.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nInitialize:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: len = 1\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\ndp = 0\n\ninteger :: base =1\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s = '0' or '1'\n\nThen, loop over i from 0 to len-1 (i=0):\n\ncurrent_char = s(len-1 -i) \u2192 since len is 1, len-1 -i =0 -0 =0 \u2192 s(1) if 1-based? Wait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based by default. So s(1) is the first character.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Fortran, a character variable s of length 1 has s(1) as its only character.\n\nSo, for the input string stored in s (length 1), the character at position 1 is the only one.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to len-1 (0 to 0 in our case). The current character is at position (len-1 -i) \u2192 for i=0, it's (0 -0)=0 \u2192 but in Java, arrays are 0-based, so that's the first character. In Fortran, the equivalent would be s(1).\n\nThus, in the loop for i from 0 to len-1 (0 to 0):\n\ncurrent_char = s( (len -1 -i) +1 ) \u2192 because Fortran is 1-based. Wait, len-1 -i is 0, so adding 1 gives 1 \u2192 s(1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's process the characters in reverse order as per the Java code.\n\nThe Java code processes the characters from the end to the beginning. For a string of length 1, it's just the first character.\n\nSo for the third program's processing:\n\nThe loop runs once (i=0):\n\ncurrent_char is s(1) (the only character).\n\nThen, if it's '?', process all digits 0-9, else use the digit.\n\nThen, for each pre in 0 to 12:\n\n   if it's '?', then loop next from 0 to9:\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp[i][new_remainder] = dp[i][new_remainder] + (if i ==0 then (pre ==0 ?1 :0) else dp(i-1, pre) )\n\n      then mod MOD.\n\n   else:\n\n      next = digit value (e.g., 0 or 1)\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp[i][new_remainder] = dp[i][new_remainder] + (if i==0 then (pre ==0 ?1 :0) else dp(i-1, pre) )\n\n      mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to zero, so we need to handle the initial conditions properly.\n\nWait, the DP is built step by step. For each step i (starting from 0), the current dp[i][...] depends on dp[i-1][...] from the previous step.\n\nBut for i=0 (the first step), the previous step is i-1 = -1, which is invalid. So the initial condition is that before any steps, the remainder is 0, so for the first step, the previous value is 1 if pre is 0, else 0.\n\nThus, for i=0:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   the previous value is 1 if pre ==0 else 0.\n\nSo for each pre:\n\n   if current_char is '?', then for each next in 0-9:\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp(0, new_remainder) = dp(0, new_remainder) + (pre ==0 ?1 :0)\n\n      mod MOD.\n\n   else:\n\n      next = digit value (e.g., 0 or 1)\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp(0, new_remainder) = dp(0, new_remainder) + (pre ==0 ?1 :0)\n\n      mod MOD.\n\nWait, but this is for each pre. Wait, the code loops over all pre and next (if ?), and accumulates into the new remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps the code in Fortran would look like this:\n\ndo i = 0, len-1\n\n   current_char = s( (len -1 -i) +1 )  ! convert to 1-based index\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n\n      do pre =0, 12\n\n         do next_digit =0,9\n\n            new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            if (i ==0) then\n\n               dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + (pre ==0 ? 1 :0 )\n\n            else\n\n               dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            end if\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n         end do\n\n      end do\n\n   else\n\n      next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n      do pre =0,12\n\n         new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n         if (i ==0) then\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + (pre ==0 ?1 :0 )\n\n         else\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n         end if\n\n         dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this may not be correct because in the loops over pre and next_digit, the order of accumulation is important. The original code in Java uses +=, so for each pre and next_digit, the contribution is added to the new_remainder's count.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each pre and next_digit (if ?), the code does:\n\ndp[i][new_remainder] += (previous value)\n\nSo in Fortran, for each pre and next_digit, we need to add the previous value to the new_remainder's entry.\n\nBut in the loops above, for each pre and next_digit, the code is adding to dp(i, new_remainder) the previous value. However, this would be done for all pre and next_digit combinations, which may not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the loops should be structured as:\n\nFor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   previous_value = (i>0 ? dp(i-1, pre) : (pre ==0 ?1 :0))\n\n   if current_char is '?', then for each next_digit in 0..9:\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_value\n\n   else:\n\n      next_digit = digit\n\n      new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n      dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_value\n\n   then mod MOD.\n\nWait, that's better. So the loops should be:\n\nfor each pre:\n\n   get previous_value.\n\n   then, for each possible next_digit (if ?):\n\n      compute new_remainder and add previous_value to dp[i][new_remainder]\n\n   else:\n\n      compute new_remainder and add previous_value to dp[i][new_remainder]\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndo i =0, len-1\n\n   current_char = s( (len-1 -i)+1 )\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n\n      do pre =0,12\n\n         previous_val = 0\n\n         if (i ==0) then\n\n            if (pre ==0) then\n\n               previous_val =1\n\n            else\n\n               previous_val =0\n\n            end if\n\n         else\n\n            previous_val = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n         end if\n\n         do next_digit =0,9\n\n            new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_val\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n         end do\n\n      end do\n\n   else\n\n      next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n      do pre =0,12\n\n         previous_val =0\n\n         if (i ==0) then\n\n            if (pre ==0) then\n\n               previous_val =1\n\n            else\n\n               previous_val =0\n\n            end if\n\n         else\n\n            previous_val = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n         end if\n\n         new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n         dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_val\n\n         dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this way, for each pre and next_digit (if ?), the previous_val is added to the new_remainder's count. This should be correct.\n\nNow, after processing all steps, the result is dp(len-1,5). Since len is 1, it's dp(0,5).\n\nThus, the final output is dp(0,5).\n\nPutting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read n and n integers.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (sum over a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2).\n\n3. Compute second_result = 0 if first_result ==1 else 1.\n\n4. Convert second_result to a character string (either '0' or '1').\n\n5. Process this string through the DP as per the third program.\n\n6. Output the result of the DP (dp(0,5)).\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and the numbers.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, i, x, a(0:32), count_bits, first_result\n\nread*, n\n\na = 0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   read*, x\n\n   a(count_bits(x)) = a(count_bits(x)) +1\n\nend do\n\nfirst_result = 0\n\ndo i=0,32\n\n   first_result = first_result + (a(i)*(a(i)-1))/2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the summation is (1 + (a[i]-1))/2 * (a[i]-1) \u2192 which is the same as a[i]*(a[i]-1)/2. So yes.\n\nSecond part:\n\nsecond_result = 0\n\nif (first_result ==1) then\n\n   second_result =0\n\nelse\n\n   second_result =1\n\nend if\n\nThird part:\n\nNow, the third part's processing.\n\nWe need to process the string s which is '0' or '1'.\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s\n\ns = char(ichar('0') + second_result)\n\nThen, the DP setup:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: len =1\n\ninteger :: dp(0:len-1, 0:12) =0\n\ninteger :: base =1\n\ninteger :: i, pre, next_digit, new_remainder\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: current_char\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n   current_char = s( (len-1 -i)+1 )  ! since Fortran is 1-based\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n\n      do pre=0,12\n\n         integer :: previous_val\n\n         if (i ==0) then\n\n            previous_val = merge(1,0, pre ==0)\n\n         else\n\n            previous_val = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n         end if\n\n         do next_digit=0,9\n\n            new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_val\n\n            dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n         end do\n\n      end do\n\n   else\n\n      next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n      do pre=0,12\n\n         integer :: previous_val\n\n         if (i ==0) then\n\n            previous_val = merge(1,0, pre ==0)\n\n         else\n\n            previous_val = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n         end if\n\n         new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n         dp(i, new_remainder) = dp(i, new_remainder) + previous_val\n\n         dp(i, new_remainder) = mod( dp(i, new_remainder), MOD )\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nThe final result is dp(len-1,5) \u2192 dp(0,5).\n\nFinally, print that value.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe complete Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, x, a(0:32), first_result, second_result\n  integer :: MOD, len, dp(0:0, 0:12), base, pre, next_digit, new_remainder\n  character(len=1) :: s, current_char\n\n  !

So dp(0:0, 0:12).\n\nBut in the code above, the declaration is:\n\ninteger :: dp(0:0, 0:12)\n\nBut in the loop, when i=0, it's okay.\n\nAlso, the 'merge' function is used to set previous_val to 1 if pre==0 else 0.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs:\n\nSuppose first program's output is 1 \u2192 second_result is 0 \u2192 s is '0'.\n\nThen, processing '0':\n\ncurrent_char is '0', not '?'\n\nnext_digit is 0.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nprevious_val is 1 if pre==0 else 0 (since i=0).\n\nnew_remainder = (base *0 + pre) mod13 \u2192 since base is 1 initially.\n\nWait, base starts at 1.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nprevious_val is 1.\n\nnew_remainder = (1*0 +0) mod13 \u21920 \u2192 dp(0,0) +=1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nFor pre=1 to 12: previous_val is 0, so no contribution.\n\nThus, after processing, dp(0,0) is 1, others 0.\n\nThen, the final result is dp(0,5) \u21920.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first_result is 0 \u2192 second_result is 1 \u2192 s is '1'.\n\nProcessing '1':\n\nnext_digit is 1.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nprevious_val is 1.\n\nnew_remainder = (1*1 +0) mod13 \u21921 \u2192 dp(0,1) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute nothing.\n\nThus, dp(0,5) is 0.\n\nThus, the code should output 0 in both cases.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that all variables are properly declared and that the function count_bits is correctly placed in a contains block.\n\nAlso, in the DP loop, the variables pre, next_digit, new_remainder are declared in the main program, but inside the loop, they are redeclared? Wait no, in the code above, the variables are declared in the main program's scope. The 'pre' and 'next_digit' are loop variables, so their declarations are okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThe variables pre and next_digit are declared in the main program's scope (integer :: pre, next_digit, new_remainder). But inside the loops, they are used as loop variables. That should be okay, but in Fortran, the loop variables are local to the loop. Wait, no, in Fortran, the loop variables are local to the loop construct. So perhaps the declarations outside are redundant and can be removed.\n\nWait, in the code above, the variables are declared in the main program's scope, but inside the loop, they are reinitialized. But perhaps it's better to remove the declarations outside and let the loop variables be local.\n\nAlternatively, the code may have an error here. Let me check:\n\nIn the code:\n\ninteger :: MOD, len, dp(0:0, 0:12), base, pre, next_digit, new_remainder\n\nThese variables are declared in the main program's scope. Then, in the loop:\n\ndo pre =0,12\n\n   ... \n\n   do next_digit=0,9\n\n      new_remainder = mod( ... )\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThe variables pre and next_digit are loop indices, so their values are local to the loop. The declarations outside may not be necessary and could cause confusion. It's better to remove those declarations and let the loop variables be local.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nRemove the declarations for pre, next_digit, new_remainder in the main program's variable declarations.\n\nThus, the variable declarations become:\n\ninteger :: MOD, len, dp(0:0, 0:12), base\n\nThen, inside the loop, the variables pre, next_digit, new_remainder are declared as loop variables or inside the loop.\n\nWait, new_remainder is used inside the loop, so it should be declared inside the loop's scope.\n\nAlternatively, declare it inside the loop.\n\nWait, in the code above, new_remainder is declared in the main program's scope. But in the loop, it's assigned a value each time. That's okay, but perhaps better to declare it inside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, the code may have an error here. Let me see:\n\nIn the code as written, new_remainder is declared in the main program's scope. So each time it's assigned a new value in the loop, that's okay. But since it's used in multiple loops, it's okay as long as it's not needed outside.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: the DP array is initialized to zero. In Fortran, when you declare an array with =0, it initializes all elements to zero. So the line:\n\ndp =0\n\nis correct.\n\nThus, the final code should be as written above, with the function count_bits in a contains block.\n\nI think this should work."
