Then multiplies K by 9? Then finds the smallest ans where (10^ans -1)/9 mod K ==0? Because the loop is finding the minimal ans where 10^ans \u22611 mod K. Because remainder starts as 10 mod K, then each step multiplies by 10 mod K. So the loop is looking for when the remainder cycles back to 1. So the answer is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, but only if K is co-prime with 10? Since K must not be divisible by 2 or 5, which is checked first.\n\nNow, the three Java programs are run in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (from the first program's input), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the Fortran code so that:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and array v).\n2. Process the first program's logic, getting its answer (ans1).\n3. Use ans1 as the input to the second program, which processes it (convert to binary, count 1s, get ans2).\n4. Use ans2 as input to the third program, compute its answer (ans3).\n5. Output ans3.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first. The first program's output is an integer (ans1). The second program takes that integer as input, so the second program's input is ans1. Then the second's output is ans2, which is the input to the third program. The third takes that ans2 as K, and computes the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst program's output is an integer (ans1). Second program takes that as input (n in its code), computes the number of 1s in binary (ans2). Third program takes ans2 as K, computes the required value (ans3). The final output is ans3.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the first program's input (n and array v).\n\nCompute ans1 (from first program's logic).\n\nThen compute ans2 by taking ans1, converting to binary, count the 1s.\n\nThen compute ans3 using ans2 as K in the third program's logic.\n\nFinally, print ans3.\n\nNow, let's think about each part's implementation in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nThe first program counts the occurrences of each number in even and odd indices, then sorts the counts in descending order, and calculates the answer based on the top counts.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if needed. Let me see:\n\nThe Java code uses arrays of size 100010 for vo, ve, vt. Since n can be up to 1e5, but the array is 100010, which is 1e5+10. So in Fortran, we can declare arrays of size 100010, but maybe we can use dynamic arrays or just fixed size.\n\nWait, in Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays. But for simplicity, perhaps just use a large enough static array. Let's see:\n\nThe first step is to read n and the array v. The array v has n elements. The counts are stored in vo, ve, vt arrays of size 100010 (indices 0 to 100010?), but in Java, they are initialized as new Integer[100010], which is 100010 elements. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array of size 100010 for each. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so maybe we need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses v[i], which can be up to n elements. The counts are for the values in v. So the maximum possible value in v is up to 1e5? Because the array is 100010, but maybe the problem constraints allow that. So in Fortran, the arrays vo, ve, vt can be of size 100010, with indices from 0 to 100009 (if using 0-based). But Fortran is 1-based, so perhaps we can shift by 1. Alternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use arrays of size 100010, with indices 1 to 100010, and when accessing v[i], we can use v(i+1) or something. Hmm, perhaps better to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array v (size n).\n\nInitialize vo, ve, vt arrays of size 100010 (or 100010 elements) to zero.\n\nLoop over each element in v:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1 (Java uses 0-based), so in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < n; i++), so in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to n (since arrays start at 1). So the index in the array v would be v(i), and the value is v(i). The Java code uses v[i], so in Fortran, the value is v(i).\n\nThen, for each value, increment vt(value) by 1. Also, if the index (i in Java, which is 0-based) is even (i%2 ==0), then it's even index (0,2,4 etc.), so in Fortran, since the loop is 1-based, the index in Java is (i-1). So (i-1) %2 ==0 \u2192 i is odd (since i starts at 1). Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (i %2 ==0 \u2192 even index \u2192 add to ve.\n\nElse \u2192 odd index \u2192 add to vo.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable is i from 1 to n:\n\nThe original index in Java is (i-1). So (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 i is odd (since i-1 is even \u2192 i is odd). So in Fortran, if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 then it's even index (Java's i even), so add to ve. Else, add to vo.\n\nSo for each value = v(i):\n\nvt(value) = vt(value) +1\n\nif (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 ve(value) +=1\n\nelse \u2192 vo(value) +=1\n\nWait, but in Java, the arrays vo, ve, vt are of type Integer, initialized to 0. So in Fortran, we can have integer arrays initialized to zero.\n\nAfter counting, we need to sort the arrays vo, ve, vt in descending order. But in Java, they are sorted using Arrays.sort with reverse order. So the top elements are first.\n\nWait, in Java, the code does:\n\nArrays.sort(vo, Collections.reverseOrder());\n\nWait, but the vo array is an array of Integers, but in the code, after filling with 0, they are incremented. Wait, actually, the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    vt[v[i]]++;\n\n    if (i % 2 ==0) {\n\n        ve[v[i]]++;\n\n    } else {\n\n        vo[v[i]]++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the vo, ve, vt arrays are of type Integer[100010], initialized with Arrays.fill to 0. So each element is an Integer (boxed). So when they do ve[v[i]]++, they are incrementing the count for the value v[i].\n\nWait, but the arrays are of size 100010, so the indices are from 0 to 100010-1. So the value v[i] must be within that range. So in Fortran, the arrays can be of size 100010, with indices 1 to 100010 (since Fortran is 1-based). So for a value x, we can use x+1 as the index? Or maybe adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the arrays can be of size 100010, with indices 0 to 100009, but that requires using a different array declaration. Hmm, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to have an array that can handle values from 0 to 100009 (since the Java array is 100010 elements, indices 0 to 100009), we can declare the array as dimension(0:100009). But in Fortran, arrays can have lower bounds. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\nBut in some compilers, you might need to use allocatable arrays or specify the bounds. Alternatively, use 1-based and shift the indices by 1. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the code can be written with arrays of size 100010, with indices 1 to 100010, and when accessing for a value x (which can be 0 to 1e5?), then the index is x+1. Wait, but if the maximum value in v is up to 1e5, then x can be up to 1e5, so x+1 would be up to 1e5+1, which is within 100010 (since 1e5+1 is 100001, which is less than 100010). So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem constraints allow the values in v to be up to 1e5, so the arrays can be of size 1e5+1. But the Java code uses 100010, which is 1e5+10, so maybe better to use 100010.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based, so to have 0-based indices, we can declare with the lower bound 0.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices by adding 1. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the arrays are dimension(1:100010). Then for a value x (0-based in Java), the index in Fortran would be x+1. So for x from 0 to 100009, the index is 1 to 100010.\n\nSo when the value is v(i), which can be up to 1e5, then x = v(i), so the index is x+1. So that's okay.\n\nSo in code:\n\nallocate(vo(1:100010), ve(1:100010), vt(1:100010))\n\nthen initialize all to zero.\n\nThen for each element in v:\n\nx = v(i)\n\nvt(x+1) = vt(x+1) +1\n\nif ( (i-1) mod 2 ==0 ) then\n\nve(x+1) = ve(x+1) +1\n\nelse\n\nvo(x+1) = vo(x+1) +1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the loop variable i in Fortran is from 1 to n (since the array v has n elements). The original Java's i starts at 0, so (i-1) in Fortran's i is (i-1) mod 2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (i %2 ==0 \u2192 even index \u2192 add to ve.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable is i from 1 to n:\n\nthe original index is (i-1). So (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even \u2192 add to ve.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAfter counting, we need to sort the arrays vo, ve, vt in descending order. But how to sort arrays in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, you can use the merge sort or other methods, but perhaps the easiest way is to create a list of the elements and sort them. Alternatively, use a temporary array and sort.\n\nAlternatively, since we need the top elements, perhaps we can find the maximum elements without sorting the entire array. Wait, the code in Java sorts the arrays in reverse order (descending), so the first element is the maximum, second next, etc.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nArrays.sort(vo, Collections.reverseOrder());\n\nBut since the arrays are of type Integer, which is an object, the sort is done on the array elements. However, in the code, after filling the arrays with 0, they are only incremented for the existing values. So the arrays have many zeros, but the non-zero elements are the counts for each value.\n\nWait, but in the code, the vo array is filled with 0, then for each occurrence in odd indices (Java's i is odd?), the vo[v[i]] is incremented. So the vo array has counts for each possible value, but most are zero except those present in the odd indices.\n\nSo when sorted in reverse order, the first element is the maximum count in vo, then next, etc.\n\nBut in Fortran, to sort the arrays in descending order, perhaps we can do the following:\n\nFor each array (vo, ve, vt), we can create an array of their elements, sort them in descending order, and then take the first few elements.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need the top two elements of each array, perhaps we can find the top two values without sorting the entire array. That would be more efficient.\n\nWait, looking at the code's usage:\n\nAfter sorting, the code uses vo[0], vo[1], ve[0], ve[1], and vt[0].\n\nSo for each array, we need the top two elements. So instead of sorting the entire array, we can find the top two elements directly.\n\nThat would be better for performance, especially since the arrays are large (1e5 elements).\n\nSo for each array (vo, ve, vt), we can find the maximum value and the second maximum.\n\nLet me think how to do that.\n\nFor example, for the vo array:\n\nInitialize max1 and max2 as the two largest values in vo.\n\nSimilarly for ve and vt.\n\nThis way, we can avoid sorting the entire array, which is better for Fortran.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nFor the vo array:\n\nmax1_vo = maxval(vo)\n\nThen, to find the second maximum, we can set all elements equal to max1_vo to zero, then take max again.\n\nWait, but that might not work if there are multiple elements with the same max.\n\nAlternatively, loop through all elements to find the top two.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\ninteger :: max1_vo, max2_vo, max1_ve, max2_ve, max1_vt, max2_vt\n\n! For vo array:\n\nmax1_vo = -huge(0)\n\nmax2_vo = -huge(0)\n\ndo i = 1, 100010\n\n    val = vo(i)\n\n    if (val > max1_vo) then\n\n        max2_vo = max1_vo\n\n        max1_vo = val\n\n    else if (val > max2_vo) then\n\n        max2_vo = val\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for ve and vt.\n\nSame for ve and vt arrays.\n\nThen, for vt, we need the first element (max1_vt) and the second (max2_vt).\n\nWait, but in the code, the condition is:\n\nif (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0]) \u2192 then compute the minimum between (n - vo[0] - ve[1], n - vo[1] - ve[0])\n\nElse, ans = n - vo[0] - ve[0]\n\nSo in Fortran terms:\n\nvo0 = max1_vo\n\nve0 = max1_ve\n\nvt0 = max1_vt\n\nve1 = max2_ve\n\nvo1 = max2_vo\n\nWait, but the second maximum of ve is max2_ve, and the second of vo is max2_vo.\n\nWait, but in the code, after sorting in reverse order, the first element is the max, second is next.\n\nSo yes, the second maximum is the second element.\n\nTherefore, by finding the top two elements for each array, we can get the required values.\n\nThis approach avoids sorting the entire array, which is better for performance, especially with large arrays.\n\nSo that's the plan for the first part.\n\nOnce we have the max1 and max2 for vo, ve, vt, then compute the ans1 as per the condition.\n\nNow, moving to the second program (codeforces_579_A):\n\nThe second program takes an integer n (which is ans1 from first program), converts it to binary, counts the number of 1's, and outputs that count.\n\nIn Fortran, to count the number of 1 bits in a number, we can do it by looping through the bits.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop that repeatedly divides by 2 and counts the remainder.\n\nThe code in Java does:\n\nint ans =0;\n\nwhile (n>0) {\n\n    int x = n%2;\n\n    n = n/2;\n\n    s += x + \"\";\n\n}\n\nthen loops over the string's characters, counting '1's.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can do:\n\ncount =0\n\ntemp = ans1\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    if (mod(temp,2) ==1) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end if\n\n    temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nans2 = count\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC174_C):\n\nThe third program takes K (ans2 from second program), and computes the minimal n where 10^n \u22611 mod K, but with some conditions.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 output -1.\n\nElse, if K is divisible by 7 \u2192 divide K by 7.\n\nMultiply K by 9 \u2192 wait, no, let me recheck the code.\n\nWait the code in the third program's solve function:\n\nif (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0 \u2192 return -1.\n\nif (K%7 ==0 \u2192 K /=7.\n\nK *=9 \u2192 Wait, why?\n\nWait the code says:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nWait, so after dividing by 7 (if divisible), multiply by 9?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute K = (K /7) *9 ?\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7.\n\nThen K *=9 \u2192 so K becomes (K/7)*9 ?\n\nWait, but why?\n\nLooking at the problem statement for ABC174 C, perhaps the problem requires finding the minimal n where 7 divides (n^9 - K) or something else. But the code's logic is a bit unclear without the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is solving for the minimal n where 7 divides n^9 mod something? Not sure, but the code's logic is as follows:\n\nThe code's solve function:\n\n- If K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\n- If K is divisible by 7 \u2192 divide by 7.\n\n- Multiply K by 9 \u2192 K = (K /7)*9 (if divisible by 7) or K*9 otherwise?\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0 \u2192 K /=7.\n\nThen K *=9.\n\nSo regardless of whether it was divisible by 7, after that step, K is multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires K to be multiplied by 9, but after dividing by 7 if possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal n such that 7 divides n^9 mod K? Not sure, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nContinuing, after that, the code initializes ans=1, remainder=10 mod K.\n\nThen loops while remainder !=1:\n\nans +=1\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nThe loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans is the minimal such n.\n\nWait, so the code is finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, but only when K is co-prime with 10 (since the first condition checks if K is even or divisible by 5, which would make gcd(10,K) >1, so multiplicative order doesn't exist, hence return -1).\n\nWait, but after the first check, K is not divisible by 2 or 5. Then, the code may have divided by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9. So the new K is (K /7)*9, but why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires K to be adjusted in some way. Let me think of the problem's possible statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal n where 7 divides n^9 mod K, but the code's approach is different. Since I can't see the problem, I have to rely on the code.\n\nThe code's logic is:\n\nAfter the initial checks, K is modified by dividing by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9. Then, the code computes the multiplicative order of 10 modulo the new K.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires K to be multiplied by 9, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the code's steps must be followed.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead K (ans2 from second program).\n\nCheck if K mod 2 ==0 or mod5 \u2192 if yes, output -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then\n\n    K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nthen compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1.\n\nWait, but the code in Java does:\n\nremainder = 10 % K \u2192 which is 10 mod K.\n\nthen loop:\n\nwhile remainder !=1:\n\n    ans +=1\n\n    remainder = (remainder *10) mod K\n\nSo the loop starts with ans=1, remainder=10 mod K.\n\nWait, initial ans is 1, and remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, ans is 1.\n\nremainder is 10 mod K.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nif remainder is 1 \u2192 exit, so ans is 1.\n\nElse, ans increments, and remainder becomes (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1, and the ans is the number of steps taken.\n\nWait, the first iteration:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nIf remainder is 1 \u2192 done, so ans is 1.\n\nElse, ans becomes 2, and remainder is (10 mod K)*10 mod K \u2192 10^2 mod K.\n\nWait, so the ans is the exponent n where 10^n mod K ==1.\n\nYes, so the code is finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K.\n\nBut after the K is modified as per the code's steps.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead K (ans2).\n\nif mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0 \u2192 output -1.\n\nelse:\n\n    if mod(K,7) ==0 then\n\n        K = K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    K = K *9\n\n    ans3 = 1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans3 = ans3 +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n    end do\n\n    output ans3\n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by 7, K is multiplied by 9. So the new K is (K /7)*9 if divisible by 7, else K*9.\n\nWait, but why multiply by 9? That's unclear, but the code does that, so we must follow.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires K to be multiplied by 9, but I can't tell. Anyway, the code's logic must be followed.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program must read the first input (n and array v), process the first part to get ans1, then process the second part (binary count) to get ans2, then process the third part (the multiplicative order) to get ans3, then output ans3.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read the input for the first program.\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array v.\n\nThen process the first part to compute ans1.\n\nThen compute ans2 from ans1.\n\nThen compute ans3 from ans2.\n\nFinally, print ans3.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and the array v.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: v\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(v(n))\n\nread(*,*) v\n\nThen, initialize the vo, ve, vt arrays. Let's use arrays of size 100010 (indices 1 to 100010), so that for a value x (0-based in Java), the index is x+1.\n\ninteger, dimension(1:100010) :: vo, ve, vt\n\nvo = 0\n\nve =0\n\nvt =0\n\nThen loop over each element in v:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    x = v(i)\n\n    vt(x+1) = vt(x+1) +1\n\n    if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n        ve(x+1) = ve(x+1) +1\n\n    else\n\n        vo(x+1) = vo(x+1) +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen find the top two elements for each array.\n\nFirst for vo:\n\ninteger :: max1_vo, max2_vo, max1_ve, max2_ve, max1_vt, max2_vt\n\nmax1_vo = -huge(0)\n\nmax2_vo = -huge(0)\n\ndo i =1, 100010\n\n    val = vo(i)\n\n    if (val > max1_vo) then\n\n        max2_vo = max1_vo\n\n        max1_vo = val\n\n    else if (val > max2_vo) then\n\n        max2_vo = val\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for ve:\n\nmax1_ve = -huge(0)\n\nmax2_ve = -huge(0)\n\ndo i =1, 100010\n\n    val = ve(i)\n\n    if (val > max1_ve) then\n\n        max2_ve = max1_ve\n\n        max1_ve = val\n\n    else if (val > max2_ve) then\n\n        max2_ve = val\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nFor vt:\n\nmax1_vt = -huge(0)\n\nmax2_vt = -huge(0)\n\ndo i =1, 100010\n\n    val = vt(i)\n\n    if (val > max1_vt) then\n\n        max2_vt = max1_vt\n\n        max1_vt = val\n\n    else if (val > max2_vt) then\n\n        max2_vt = val\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nNow compute ans1:\n\nif (max1_vo + max1_ve == max1_vt) then\n\n    ans1 = min( n - max1_vo - max2_ve, n - max2_vo - max1_ve )\n\nelse\n\n    ans1 = n - max1_vo - max1_ve\n\nend if\n\nWait, the original code's condition is vo[0]+ve[0] == vt[0]. Since vo[0] is max1_vo, ve[0] is max1_ve, and vt[0] is max1_vt.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, compute ans2:\n\nans2 =0\n\ntemp = ans1\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n    if (mod(temp,2) ==1) then\n\n        ans2 = ans2 +1\n\n    end if\n\n    temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nNow, compute ans3:\n\nans3 = -1\n\nK = ans2\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n    ans3 = -1\n\nelse\n\n    if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n        K = K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    K = K *9\n\n    ans3 =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans3 = ans3 +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nFinally, output ans3.\n\nBut wait, in the third program's code, the solve function returns the computed value, but if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. So in Fortran, the code above does that.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut need to make sure that all variables are properly declared.\n\nAlso, note that in the third part, K can be zero? Well, since the first check is if K is even or divisible by 5, but the input comes from ans2, which is the count of 1's in the binary of ans1. Since ans1 is at least 0, ans2 is non-negative. But if ans2 is zero, then K=0, but then mod(K,2) would be 0, so returns -1.\n\nBut in the first part, ans1 can be zero? Let's see: the first program's ans is computed as n - ... etc. So if n is zero, but the first program's input requires n to be given, but the problem's constraints probably have n \u22651.\n\nBut in code, we can proceed.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nAlso, note that in the third part, when K is modified, K must be an integer. So in Fortran, when dividing by 7, it's integer division.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, x, ans1, ans2, ans3, K, remainder, temp\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: v\n\n    integer, dimension(1:100010) :: vo, ve, vt\n\n    integer :: max1_vo, max2_vo, max1_ve, max2_ve, max1_vt, max2_vt\n\n    !

So that's okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's ans1 is 0 \u2192 ans2 is 0 \u2192 K=0 \u2192 then mod(K,2) is 0 \u2192 ans3 is -1.\n\nAnother case: if ans2 is 7 \u2192 K=7 \u2192 then since mod(7,7)=0 \u2192 K becomes 1 \u2192 then K*9=9.\n\nThen compute the multiplicative order of 10 mod 9.\n\nWait 10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 ans3 is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see the third program's sample input.\n\nSuppose K=7 (from ans2=7):\n\nAfter dividing by7 \u2192 K=1 \u2192 multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen 10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 so remainder is 1 \u2192 ans3=1.\n\nWhich matches the code's logic.\n\nAnother example: K=3 (ans2=3).\n\nCheck if divisible by 2 or5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck mod7 \u2192 no.\n\nSo K becomes 3*9=27.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where 10^n mod27 =1.\n\n10 mod27 is 10.\n\n10^2 mod27 is 100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 19.\n\n10^3 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 so n=3.\n\nThus ans3 would be 3.\n\nThe code would compute:\n\nremainder starts as 10 mod27=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nans3=1 \u2192 remainder=10 \u2192 not 1.\n\nans3=2 \u2192 remainder=10*10 mod27=100 mod27=19 \u2192 not 1.\n\nans3=3 \u2192 remainder=19*10 mod27=190 mod27=1 \u2192 yes. So loop exits, ans3=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check for possible overflows.\n\nIn the third part, K can be up to ans2*9. Since ans2 is the count of 1's in the binary of ans1, which can be up to log2(1e5) ~17, so ans2 is up to 17 \u2192 K is up to 17*9=153. So no overflow issues.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
