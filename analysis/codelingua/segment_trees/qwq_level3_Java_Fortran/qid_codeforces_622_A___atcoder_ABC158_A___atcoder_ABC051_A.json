    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer from input, does some calculations to find a position in a sequence, and outputs a result. The second file (atcoder_ABC158_A) checks if a string contains both 'A' and 'B' and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". The third (atcoder_ABC051_A) replaces commas in a string with spaces and outputs the modified string.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the Fortran program must process the input through all three steps in sequence without I/O in between.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\n1. **First Program (codeforces_622_A):**\n   - Reads a long (position) from input.\n   - Computes the nearest sequence start index and calculates the result as (position - startIndex) + 1.\n   - The output here is the printed number.\n\n2. **Second Program (atcoder_ABC158_A):**\n   - Takes the first program's output (a number) as input. Wait, but the second program expects a string input (since it checks for 'A' and 'B'). Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the first program outputs a number, which when passed to the second program, which expects a string. Wait, but in the original setup, the output of the first is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which when written to the next program's input, the second program reads it as a string? Or maybe the first program's output is a number, but the second program is expecting a string that contains 'A' and 'B'? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program's solve method: it reads a string s = in.next(); which is the input. So the input to the second program is a string. But the first program outputs a number. So the first program's output is a number, which becomes the input to the second program. So the second program is expecting that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B', so it would output \"No\". But maybe the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a string that contains 'A' and 'B'? Wait, no. The first program's input is a number (position), and its output is a number. So the second program is expecting a string input, but the first's output is a number. That would mean that the second program's input is a number, so the check for 'A' and 'B' would fail unless the number is part of a string that includes those letters. Wait, this seems conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program. But the second program is expecting a string. So the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program's input is \"123\", which doesn't have 'A' or 'B', so it would output \"No\". But maybe the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a string? Wait no, the first program's input is a number (position is read via nextLong()), so the first's output is a number. So the second program's input is a number, so the second program's output would be \"No\" unless the number is part of a string with 'A' and 'B', which is unlikely. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the second program is not part of the same input chain? Or maybe the problem is that the three Java files are supposed to be run in sequence, each taking input from the previous's output. So the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Let me re-express the sequence:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output1\nOutput1 -> Program2 -> Output2\nOutput2 -> Program3 -> Final Output\n\nSo the first program's output is the input to the second, which is a number. But the second program expects a string (since it reads in.next() which is a string). So the second program's input is the number from the first program's output, which is read as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", so the check for 'A' and 'B' would be false, so output \"No\". Then the third program takes \"No\" as input, replaces commas with spaces (but there are none), so outputs \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code is to read a string, replace commas with spaces, and output. So if the second program outputs \"No\", then the third program's input is \"No\", so the output is \"No\".\n\nSo the entire sequence would take an initial input (the position for the first program), process through all three steps, and the final output is the result of the third program.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, the last writing output, and the intermediates processing without I/O.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the position for the first program) from stdin.\n\n2. Process through the first program's logic (compute the result as per codeforces_622_A's solve method).\n\n3. Take that result, pass it to the second program's logic (check if the string contains 'A' and 'B'). Wait, but the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which must be converted to a string to be the input for the second step.\n\nWait, in the original setup, the first program's output is a number (printed as a string), which is then the input to the second program. So in the Fortran code, after computing the first result (a number), we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the second step's logic (checking for 'A' and 'B').\n\nThen, the second step's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the third step. The third step replaces commas with spaces, but since \"Yes\" and \"No\" have no commas, the output remains the same. So the final output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code is to read a line, replace commas with spaces, and output. So if the second program's output is \"Yes\", then the third program's input is \"Yes\", so the output is \"Yes\".\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFortran program steps:\n\n- Read the initial input (the position as a long integer).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (the number from codeforces_622_A).\n\n- Convert that number to a string (since the second step expects a string input).\n\n- Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B' (second step's logic). If yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n- Take that result (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and process through the third step: replace commas with spaces (but there are none, so it remains the same).\n\n- Finally, output the result of the third step.\n\nWait, but the third step's code in Java is to read a line, replace commas with spaces, and print. So in Fortran, the third step's processing is straightforward: take the string from the second step's output, replace commas with spaces, then output.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (position as integer).\n\n2. Compute the first step's result (the number).\n\n3. Convert that number to a string (so that the second step can process it).\n\n4. Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, set the second result to \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n5. Take that string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and replace any commas with spaces (though there are none here).\n\n6. Output the final string.\n\nWait, but in the second step, the input is the first's output (a number as a string). So if the first's output is, say, 5, then the second step's input is \"5\", which doesn't have 'A' or 'B', so output \"No\".\n\nSo the Fortran code must handle all these steps in sequence.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (codeforces_622_A's logic):\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nThen, find the nearest sequence start index and compute the result.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nThe algorithm in solve():\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1.\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position, multiply by 2.\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position, increment nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nThen, startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nThe result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic with integers (or integers of sufficient size, but in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes, so 64-bit).\n\nSo variables:\n\nposition is a 64-bit integer (Fortran uses INTEGER*8 or selected_int_kind(18) for that).\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nThe loop:\n\nDO WHILE (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nEND DO\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nDO WHILE (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nEND DO\n\nThen compute startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nResult is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex is straightforward: 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be written as a function.\n\nNow, the second part (atcoder_ABC158_A's logic):\n\nThe input is the string representation of the first result.\n\nCheck if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, to check if a string contains a character, we can loop through each character.\n\nAlternatively, use the INDEX function.\n\nSo, for a string s:\n\nif (INDEX(s, 'A') > 0 .and. INDEX(s, 'B') > 0) then\n\n   result2 = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   result2 = 'No'\n\nend if\n\nThird part (atcoder_ABC051_A's logic):\n\nTake the result2 string (either 'Yes' or 'No'), replace commas with spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop through each character and replace commas.\n\nAlternatively, use the REPLACE function if available, but in standard Fortran, perhaps we need to do it manually.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s, s_out\n\ns = 'Yes' (or 'No')\n\ns_out = s\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      s_out(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since the input strings here (Yes/No) have no commas, the output remains the same.\n\nFinally, output s_out.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the initial input (position as integer*8).\n\n2. Compute the first result (integer*8).\n\n3. Convert that to a string (e.g., using write/read to a string).\n\n4. Process the string through the second step's logic.\n\n5. Process the result through the third step's logic.\n\n6. Output the final string.\n\nNow, handling the conversion of the first result to a string in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use an internal write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger*8 :: first_result\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_first\n\nwrite(s_first, '(I0)') first_result\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use adjustl to left-justify.\n\ns_first = adjustl(s_first)\n\nThen, pass this string to the second step.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nProgram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer*8 :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, first_result\n\n   character(len=20) :: s_first, s_second, s_third\n\n   ! Read input\n\n   read(*,*) position\n\n   ! Compute first step\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\n   end do\n\n   startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n   first_result = (position - startIndex) +1\n\n   ! Convert first_result to string s_first\n\n   write(s_first, '(I0)') first_result\n\n   s_first = adjustl(s_first)\n\n   ! Second step: check for A and B\n\n   if (index(s_first, 'A') >0 .and. index(s_first, 'B') >0) then\n\n      s_second = 'Yes'\n\n   else\n\n      s_second = 'No'\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Third step: replace commas with spaces\n\n   s_third = s_second\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s_second)\n\n      if (s_second(i:i) == ',') then\n\n         s_third(i:i) = ' '\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Output the final result\n\n   print *, trim(s_third)\n\ncontains\n\n   integer*8 function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n      integer*8, intent(in) :: index\n\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index -1)*index /2\n\n   end function getValueAtIndex\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second step, the input is the string representation of first_result. Since first_result is a number, the string s_first will only contain digits, so it won't have 'A' or 'B', so the second step will always output 'No', unless the first_result is a string that includes letters. But according to the original setup, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string, so the check for 'A' and 'B' would be false, so the second step's output is 'No', then third step leaves it as 'No'.\n\nBut perhaps the first program's output is a number, so the second step's input is a numeric string, so the output is 'No', and the third step leaves it as 'No'.\n\nSo the final output is 'No' unless the first program's output is a string containing both 'A' and 'B', which is impossible because it's a number.\n\nHmm, but maybe the first program's output is a number, but in the original setup, the first program's output is passed to the second program as a string. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, in the first step's loops:\n\nThe loop for nrstSeqStartIndx *=2 until the value is no longer less than position.\n\nThen, increment until the next value exceeds position.\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex is correctly implemented.\n\nThe first_result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThen converting to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, when writing to a character variable with '(I0)', the number is written as a string without leading spaces, but using adjustl ensures that any leading spaces are removed.\n\nThe second step checks for 'A' and 'B' in the string. Since the string is numeric, this will be false, so 'No'.\n\nThird step: replacing commas with spaces. Since the string is 'No' or 'Yes', no commas, so output is same.\n\nThus, the final output is 'No' unless the first program's output is a string with 'A' and 'B', which can't happen here.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a number like 123AB? No, because the first program's output is a number, so it's written as a numeric string. So the second step will always output 'No', and the third step leaves it as 'No'.\n\nBut perhaps the original Java code's first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string, so the check for 'A' and 'B' is false, so the second program outputs 'No', and the third program outputs 'No'.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work as intended.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nWait, but in the second step, the code uses the INDEX function. In Fortran, the INDEX function returns the position of the substring, or 0 if not found. So the condition is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the third step's loop over the characters. Since the input is 'Yes' or 'No', which have no commas, the loop does nothing, so s_third is same as s_second.\n\nThus, the final output is 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nWait, but in the second step, if the first_result is, say, 12, then s_first is '12', so no A or B, so s_second is 'No', then third step outputs 'No'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nBut need to make sure that the loops in the first step are correctly implemented.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first loop, when multiplying by 2, we have to ensure that it doesn't overflow. But since in Java, the code uses long, which is 64 bits, and in Fortran, using integer*8 (8 bytes) is sufficient. So as long as the input is within 64-bit integer range, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nThe program will have:\n\n- Read the input (position).\n\n- Compute first_result via the loops and function.\n\n- Convert to string.\n\n- Check for 'A' and 'B'.\n\n- Replace commas (though none here).\n\n- Output.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nI think the code I outlined earlier is correct, but let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the function getValueAtIndex must be inside the program or in a module. Since it's a contained function, putting it in a CONTAINS section.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, the function is in a CONTAINS block, which is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0 (unlikely, but let's see). The string is '0', so second step outputs 'No'.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 1234AB5 (but that's impossible because first program outputs a number, so the string is numeric).\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the first_result could be a very large number, but the string conversion should handle it as Fortran can write large integers.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as follows."
