    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program. Let me start by understanding each Java file's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC124_A) reads two integers a and b from input. It then calculates a sum by taking the larger of the two each time, adding it to the sum, and decrementing that number. It does this twice. The output is the sum. So the output of this is the sum, which will be the input for the next program.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_622_A) takes a long integer position. It calculates some sequence and finds the position's corresponding value. The key functions here are the getValueAtIndex which returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. The solve function finds the nearest sequence start and calculates the result. The output here is the (position - startIndex) +1, which becomes the input for the third program.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. Outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain these three processes into a single Fortran program. The first step is to read the input (for the first Java program), process all three steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result of the third program.\n\nLet me think about the data flow:\n\n1. The first program's input is two integers a and b. The output is the sum (sum).\n2. The second program takes that sum as its input (position). Its output is the calculated value from the solve function.\n3. The third program takes that output as its input (the string should be the output of the second program's result? Wait, no. Wait, the third program's input is a string. Wait, the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. Wait, the third Java program's input is a string, so the output of the second program must be a string that the third program can process. Wait, the second program's output is a number, so when passed as input to the third program, that number is read as a string. Wait, but in the third Java program, the input is a string s = in.next(); which is the next token. So the output of the second program is a number, which when written as output, becomes a string for the third program's input. So the third program's input is the printed number from the second program. So the third program will check if that number's digits form a string with exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. For example, if the second program outputs 1212, then the third would output \"Yes\".\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part must read the two integers a and b, compute the sum as in the first Java program. Then, use that sum as the input to the second program's logic, compute the result, then use that result as the input string for the third program's logic.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read a and b from input (first part)\n- Compute the sum (first Java's logic)\n- Use that sum as the input to the second Java's logic (so the second part's input is the sum)\n- Compute the second's output (the (position - startIndex)+1)\n- Then, take that output as the input string for the third part (so convert it to a string, then process it as per third Java's logic)\n- Finally, output the third's result.\n\nWait, but in the original Java chain, each program's output is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So in the Fortran program, all steps must be done in sequence, with the outputs passed as variables.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\n1. Read a and b from input (first block)\n2. Compute the sum (first Java's logic)\n3. Take that sum as the 'position' for the second part's calculation (second Java's logic)\n4. Compute the result of the second part (the output of the second Java program)\n5. Convert that result to a string (since the third Java program expects a string input)\n6. Process that string with the third Java's logic (count characters, check counts)\n7. Output the final result (Yes/No)\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nFirst Java's code:\n\nRead a and b, then loop twice, each time taking the larger of a and b, add to sum, decrement that.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead a and b. Initialize sum=0. Then loop twice:\n\ndo i=1,2\n   if (a >= b) then\n      sum = sum + a\n      a = a -1\n   else\n      sum = sum + b\n      b = b -1\n   end if\nend do\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nSecond part: the second Java's logic.\n\nThe second Java's solve function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong(); (here, in the Fortran code, position is the sum from first part)\n\nThen, find the nearest sequence start index.\n\nThe code:\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n}\n\nthen:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nThen startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nThe result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo in Fortran, need to compute this.\n\nFirst, implement getValueAtIndex as a function.\n\nFUNCTION getValueAtIndex(index) RESULT(res)\n    INTEGER*8, INTENT(IN) :: index\n    INTEGER*8 :: res\n    res = 1 + ( (index -1)*index ) / 2\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes (64-bit) for handling large numbers. So variables need to be of type integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(18) but for simplicity, using integer*8).\n\nSo in the second part:\n\nposition is the sum from first part (sum is an integer, but in the second Java, it's treated as a long, so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 variables.\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n\nDo the first loop:\n\nDO WHILE (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\nEND DO\n\nThen the second loop:\n\nDO\n    temp = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1)\n    IF (temp > position) EXIT\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nEND DO\n\nWait, the original code is a while loop: while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position) { nrstSeqStartIndx++; }\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nDO WHILE (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nEND DO\n\nOnce that's done, compute startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nThen the result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo the second part's output is this value.\n\nThird part: the third Java's logic.\n\nThe third program takes a string s, counts the occurrences of each character. If exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2, then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nIn Fortran, the input to the third part is the result from the second part, which is an integer (the output of the second program). So we need to convert that integer to a string, then process it.\n\nSo first, convert the second's result (let's call it result2) to a string. Let's say result2 is an integer*8, so we can write it as a string using write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\ninteger*8 :: result2\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result2\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces\n\nThen, process the characters in s.\n\nWe can use an array to count the occurrences of each character. Since characters are case-sensitive? The original Java uses a string, so in the third Java, the input is case-sensitive. So in Fortran, we need to treat uppercase and lowercase as different.\n\nBut in the third Java code, the input is read as a string, so the Fortran code must process the string as is.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nInitialize a count array for each possible character. Since characters can be any, but in practice, digits (since the second's output is a number). So the string s will consist of digits, so the characters are '0' to '9'.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps use a hash map approach. But in Fortran, perhaps an array for ASCII characters.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a number converted to a string, the characters are digits. So the possible characters are 0-9, so 10 possibilities. So we can have an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) to count.\n\nWait, but the third Java uses a HashMap<Character, Integer>, so any characters can be present. But in our case, the input is the output of the second program, which is a number, so the string is digits. So the characters are only digits. So we can use an array of size 10 (for 0-9).\n\nAlternatively, to be more general, perhaps use a hash-like approach with a character array.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can loop through each character in the string, count their occurrences.\n\nInitialize an array counts(0:9) = 0\n\nThen loop over each character in s:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n    c = s(i:i)\n    n = ichar(c) - ichar('0')  ! assuming it's a digit\n    counts(n) = counts(n) +1\nend do\n\nThen check:\n\n- The total number of non-zero counts must be exactly 2.\n\n- Each of those counts must be exactly 2.\n\nWait, but the third Java code checks that all entries in the map have value 2, and the map's size is 2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncount_non_zero = 0\n\ndo i=0,9\n    if (counts(i) >0) then\n        count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n        if (counts(i) /=2) then\n            ok = .false.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nif (count_non_zero ==2 .and. ok) then\n    print *, 'Yes'\nelse\n    print *, 'No'\nend if\n\nWait, but need to handle all possibilities. Let me structure this properly.\n\nInitialize ok to .true.\n\ncount_non_zero =0\n\ndo i=0,9\n    if (counts(i) >0) then\n        count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n        if (counts(i) /=2) then\n            ok = .false.\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nif (count_non_zero ==2 .and. ok) then\n    ... yes\nelse\n    ... no\nend if\n\nAlternatively, check each count:\n\nif (count_non_zero ==2) then\n    do i=0,9\n        if (counts(i) >0 .and. counts(i)/=2) then\n            ok = .false.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\nelse\n    ok = .false.\nend if\n\nHmm, but perhaps better to track as we go.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nFirst part variables: a, b, sum (integers)\n\nSecond part variables: position (integer*8, since it's the sum from first part, which can be up to (like 1e9?), but in Java it's an int, but in the second program, it's treated as a long. So in Fortran, using integer*8 for position and all variables in second part.\n\nThird part variables: the result from second part is an integer*8, which is converted to a string s.\n\nNow, in Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: a, b, sum\n    integer*8 :: position, result2\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    integer :: counts(0:9) = 0\n    logical :: ok\n    integer :: i, n, count_non_zero\n\n    ! First part: read a and b, compute sum\n    read*, a, b\n    sum =0\n    do i=1,2\n        if (a >= b) then\n            sum = sum +a\n            a = a -1\n        else\n            sum = sum +b\n            b = b -1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Second part: compute result2\n    position = sum  ! convert to integer*8\n    integer*8 :: nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, temp\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    result2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\n    ! Third part: process result2 as string\n    write(s, '(I0)') result2\n    s = adjustl(s)  ! remove leading spaces\n\n    counts = 0\n    count_non_zero =0\n    ok = .true.\n\n    do i=1, len_trim(s)\n        character(len=1) :: c = s(i:i)\n        integer :: num = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n        counts(num) = counts(num) +1\n    end do\n\n    ! Check counts\n    count_non_zero =0\n    do i=0,9\n        if (counts(i) >0) then\n            count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n            if (counts(i) /=2) then\n                ok = .false.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (count_non_zero ==2 .and. ok) then\n        print*, 'Yes'\n    else\n        print*, 'No'\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    integer*8 function getValueAtIndex(index)\n        integer*8, intent(in) :: index\n        getValueAtIndex = 1 + ( (index -1)*index ) /2\n    end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but need to make sure that the variables are properly declared. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, in the second part, variables like nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, temp (but temp wasn't used in the code above). Wait in the code I wrote, the second loop uses getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1). So the code for the second part is:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop: while getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position, multiply by 2.\n\nSecond loop: while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position, increment.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the third part, converting result2 to a string. The write statement uses '(I0)' which writes the integer in free format. The adjustl(s) removes leading spaces, so the string is properly left-justified.\n\nThen, for each character in the string, we get its numeric value (assuming it's a digit). Since the result2 is a number, the string will only have digits, so this is safe.\n\nThe counts array is initialized to zero, then for each character, we count.\n\nThen, check if exactly two non-zero counts, each exactly 2.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the count_non_zero is calculated, and ok is set to true only if all counts are 2. Wait, the code:\n\n    do i=0,9\n        if (counts(i) >0) then\n            count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n            if (counts(i) /=2) then\n                ok = .false.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\nWait, but if any count is not 2, then ok becomes false. So after this loop, ok is true only if all non-zero counts are exactly 2, and count_non_zero is 2.\n\nWait, but the code also checks count_non_zero ==2. So the final condition is:\n\nif (count_non_zero ==2 .and. ok) then\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nSuppose the result2 is 1212 \u2192 \"1212\" \u2192 counts(1)=2, counts(2)=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nIf it's 1122 \u2192 same.\n\nIf it's 1112 \u2192 counts(1)=3, 2 \u2192 count_non_zero=2 but counts(1) is 3 \u2192 ok is false \u2192 output no.\n\nIf it's 1234 \u2192 count_non_zero=4 \u2192 no.\n\nIf it's 11 \u2192 count_non_zero=1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the function getValueAtIndex is inside the contains section, so it's accessible.\n\nNow, variables in the second part: nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex are declared as integer*8.\n\nWait in the code above, inside the second part, I have:\n\ninteger*8 :: nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, temp\n\nWait, but temp wasn't used. Wait in the original code, the second loop is:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position) \u2192 so in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\nso no need for temp. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, compiling and testing.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Overflow in the second part. Since in Java, the second program uses long (64-bit), so in Fortran, using integer*8 should be okay.\n\n- The string conversion: when writing result2 to s, which is 20 characters long. For very large numbers, but since the second program's result is (position - startIndex)+1, which could be up to, say, the maximum of the sequence. But given that the first program's sum is up to (like, if a and b are 1e9 each, sum would be 2e9, but in the second program, the calculation may not overflow with integer*8.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part, the string s may have leading zeros? For example, if result2 is 1, then the string is '1', which has length 1. Then count_non_zero would be 1 \u2192 output no.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose first program's input is a=3, b=3 \u2192 first iteration: take 3, sum +=3 \u2192 a becomes 2. Second iteration: take 3 (since b is 3 now?), wait wait let me recalculate.\n\nWait first program's code:\n\nInitially a=3, b=3.\n\nFirst iteration (i=0 in Java, but in Fortran, the loop is from 1 to 2):\n\nWait in the first Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i<2; i++), so two iterations.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\na >=b (3 >=3 \u2192 yes). sum +=3 \u2192 sum=3. a becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nNow a=2, b=3. So a < b \u2192 take b (3), add to sum (3+3=6). Then b becomes 2.\n\nSo sum is 6. So the second program's input is 6.\n\nSecond program's processing:\n\nposition =6.\n\nCompute nrstSeqStartIndx:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) \u2192 1 + (2-1)*2/2 \u2192 1+1=2. Since 2 <6 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u2192 2.\n\nNow check getValueAtIndex(4) \u2192 1 + (4*3)/2 \u2192 1+6=7. 7 is not less than 6 \u2192 so exit first loop.\n\nNow, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nNow the second loop:\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(3) \u2192 1 + (3*2)/2 \u2192 1+3=4. 4 <=6 \u2192 so increment nrstSeqStartIndx to 3.\n\nCheck again: getValueAtIndex(4) \u2192 7. 7>6 \u2192 so exit loop.\n\nSo nrstSeqStartIndx is 3.\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(3) \u2192 4.\n\nResult is (6-4)+1 =3.\n\nSo the third program's input is \"3\".\n\nThe third program checks the string \"3\" \u2192 counts(3)=1 \u2192 count_non_zero=1 \u2192 output No.\n\nSo the final output is No.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see if the second program's output can be a 4-digit number with two pairs.\n\nSuppose first program's sum is 20.\n\nSecond program's processing:\n\nposition=20.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nStart with nrstSeqStartIndx=1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) = 2 <20 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u2192 2.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(4)=7 <20 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21924 \u2192 8 \u2192 getValueAtIndex(8) is 1+ (8*7)/2 \u2192 1+28=29. 29>20 \u2192 so exit first loop.\n\nWait, let's step through:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <20 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u2192 2.\n\nCheck 2*2=4 \u2192 getValue(4)=1 + (4*3)/2 =7 <20 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21924 \u2192 8.\n\ngetValue(8) is 1 + (8*7)/2 \u2192 1+28=29. 29>20 \u2192 so exit first loop.\n\nSo after first loop, nrstSeqStartIndx is 4 (since 2*2=4, then 4*2=8, but since 8's value is 29>20, so the loop stops at 4? Wait no:\n\nWait the first loop is while (getValue(2*nrst) < position). So when nrst is 4, 2*4=8 \u2192 getValue(8)=29>20 \u2192 so the condition is false, so loop stops. So the final nrst after first loop is 4.\n\nThen second loop:\n\nCheck getValue(4+1)=getValue(5) \u2192 1 + (5*4)/2 \u2192 1+10=11 \u226420 \u2192 so increment to 5.\n\nCheck getValue(6) \u2192 1 + (6*5)/2 \u2192 1+15=16 \u226420 \u2192 increment to 6.\n\nCheck getValue(7) \u2192 1+ (7*6)/2 \u2192 1+21=22>20 \u2192 so exit loop.\n\nSo nrst is 6.\n\nstartIndex = getValue(6) \u2192 1 + (6*5)/2 \u2192 1+15=16.\n\nResult is (20-16)+1 =5 \u2192 so the third program's input is \"5\" \u2192 output No.\n\nHmm, maybe another example where the second program's output is 1212.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose the second program's output is 1212 \u2192 then third program's input is \"1212\" \u2192 counts for 1 and 2 each 2 \u2192 output yes.\n\nTo get that, the second program's result must be 1212.\n\nLet me see what position would lead to that.\n\nSuppose position is 1212.\n\nLet me compute the steps:\n\nFirst, find nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nStart at 1.\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <1212 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\ngetValue(4)=7 <1212 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21924 \u2192 8 \u2192 getValue(8)=29 <1212 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21928 \u2192 16 \u2192 getValue(16)=1+ (16*15)/2 \u2192 1+120=121 \u2192 121 <1212 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u219216 \u2192 32 \u2192 getValue(32)=1 + (32*31)/2 \u2192 1 + 496 =497 <1212 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u219232 \u219264 \u2192 getValue(64)=1 + (64*63)/2 \u2192 1 + 2016 =2017>1212 \u2192 so exit first loop.\n\nSo after first loop, nrst is 32 (since 64's value is over, so the last doubling was 32*2=64 which is over, so the loop stops at 32).\n\nWait let me retrace:\n\nWait the first loop is while (getValue(2*nrst) < position).\n\nStarting with nrst=1:\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 value 2 <1212 \u2192 multiply to 2.\n\nCheck 2*2=4 \u2192 value 7 <1212 \u2192 multiply to 4.\n\nCheck 2*4=8 \u2192 value 29 < \u2192 multiply to 8.\n\nCheck 2*8=16 \u2192 value 1+ (16*15)/2 \u2192 1+120=121 < \u2192 multiply to 16.\n\nCheck 2*16=32 \u2192 value 1 + (32*31)/2 \u2192 1 + 496 =497 < \u2192 multiply to 32.\n\nCheck 2*32=64 \u2192 value 1 + (64*63)/2 \u2192 1 + 2016 =2017>1212 \u2192 so the condition is false. So the loop stops, and nrst is 32.\n\nNow second loop:\n\nCheck getValue(32+1)=getValue(33) \u2192 1 + (33*32)/2 \u2192 1 + 528 =529 \u22641212 \u2192 so increment to 33.\n\nCheck getValue(34) \u2192 1 + (34*33)/2 \u2192 1 + 561 =562 \u2264 \u2192 increment to 34.\n\nContinue until the value exceeds 1212.\n\nWait this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the final nrst is 47?\n\nWait let me compute:\n\nWe need to find the largest index where getValue(index) \u2264 position, but the next index's value is over.\n\nWait the process is to find the largest index where getValue(index) \u2264 position, but the next index's value is over?\n\nWait the code's second loop is:\n\nwhile (getValue(nrst+1) <= position) \u2192 increment.\n\nSo after the first loop, nrst is 32.\n\nNow, in the second loop:\n\nWe start with nrst=32.\n\nCheck getValue(33) \u2192 1 + (33*32)/2 \u2192 1 + 528 =529 \u22641212 \u2192 so increment to 33.\n\nCheck getValue(34) \u2192 1 + (34*33)/2 \u2192 1+561=562 \u2264 \u2192 increment to 34.\n\nContinue until the value of getValue(nrst+1) exceeds 1212.\n\nLet me compute when does getValue(nrst) exceed 1212?\n\nWe need to find the nrst where getValue(nrst) \u22641212 and getValue(nrst+1) >1212.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSuppose nrst is x, so:\n\ngetValue(x) = 1 + x(x-1)/2 \u22641212,\n\nand getValue(x+1) =1 + (x+1)x/2 >1212.\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\n1 + x(x-1)/2 \u22641212 \u2192 x(x-1)/2 \u22641211 \u2192 x\u00b2 -x -2422 \u22640 \u2192 solving x\u00b2 -x -2422 =0 \u2192 x=(1 + sqrt(1+4*2422))/2 \u2192 sqrt(9689) \u224898.43 \u2192 so x\u2248 (1+98.43)/2 \u224849.7 \u2192 so x=49.\n\nCheck x=49:\n\ngetValue(49) =1 + (49*48)/2 \u2192 1 + 1176 =1177 \u22641212.\n\ngetValue(50) =1 + (50*49)/2 \u2192 1+1225=1226>1212 \u2192 so the correct nrst is 49.\n\nSo after the second loop, nrst becomes 49.\n\nThus startIndex = getValue(49)=1177.\n\nResult is (1212-1177)+1 = 36 \u2192 so the third program's input is 36 \u2192 \"36\" \u2192 counts for '3' and '6' each 1 \u2192 count_non_zero=2 but counts are 1 each \u2192 so output No.\n\nHmm, so that's not the case I wanted. Let me think of a position that would give 1212 as the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps position= 1212 is not the right choice. Let me think of a position where the result is 1212.\n\nSuppose the result is 1212 \u2192 then the third program's input is \"1212\" \u2192 which is two characters (1 and 2) each appearing twice \u2192 output yes.\n\nTo get that, the result2 must be 1212 \u2192 so (position - startIndex) +1 =1212 \u2192 so position - startIndex =1211 \u2192 so startIndex = position -1211.\n\nBut startIndex is getValue(nrst).\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to pick a position where the result is 1122.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose the result is 1122 \u2192 then the third program would output yes.\n\nTo get that, the result2 must be 1122 \u2192 so (position - startIndex) +1 =1122 \u2192 position = startIndex +1121.\n\nSuppose the startIndex is 100 \u2192 then position would be 1221.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved. The code seems correct, so perhaps proceed.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are properly declared, and the logic follows the Java steps.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program should be as written above, with proper variable declarations and function.\n\nWait in the code I wrote earlier, the variables in the second part (nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex) are declared inside the second part's code block? Or in the main program?\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the code I wrote:\n\nAfter the first part, the second part starts with:\n\ninteger*8 :: nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, temp\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So in the main program, after the first part, before using those variables, they need to be declared.\n\nWait in the code I wrote earlier, the variables are declared inline:\n\n    ! Second part: compute result2\n    position = sum  ! convert to integer*8\n    integer*8 :: nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, temp\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables in the middle of the code like that. You have to declare all variables at the top of the program or in a block.\n\nAh, that's a mistake. So I need to adjust that.\n\nSo the variables for the second part must be declared in the variable declarations section.\n\nSo the corrected code would have all variables declared at the start.\n\nLet me restructure the code properly.\n\nRewriting the program with proper variable declarations:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: a, b, sum\n    integer*8 :: position, result2, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    integer :: counts(0:9) = 0\n    logical :: ok\n    integer :: i, n, count_non_zero\n\n    ! Declare variables for second part\n    integer*8 :: temp\n\n    ! First part: read a and b, compute sum\n    read*, a, b\n    sum =0\n    do i=1,2\n        if (a >= b) then\n            sum = sum +a\n            a = a -1\n        else\n            sum = sum +b\n            b = b -1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Second part: compute result2\n    position = sum  ! convert to integer*8\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    result2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\n    ! Third part: process result2 as string\n    write(s, '(I0)') result2\n    s = adjustl(s)  ! remove leading spaces\n\n    counts = 0\n    count_non_zero =0\n    ok = .true.\n\n    do i=1, len_trim(s)\n        character(len=1) :: c = s(i:i)\n        integer :: num = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n        counts(num) = counts(num) +1\n    end do\n\n    ! Check counts\n    count_non_zero =0\n    do i=0,9\n        if (counts(i) >0) then\n            count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n            if (counts(i) /=2) then\n                ok = .false.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (count_non_zero ==2 .and. ok) then\n        print*, 'Yes'\n    else\n        print*, 'No'\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    integer*8 function getValueAtIndex(index)\n        integer*8, intent(in) :: index\n        getValueAtIndex = 1 + ( (index -1)*index ) /2\n    end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's loops, the temp variable was not used, so I can remove it from declarations.\n\nSo the variables declared at the top are:\n\ninteger :: a, b, sum\n\ninteger*8 :: position, result2, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger :: counts(0:9) =0\n\nlogical :: ok\n\ninteger :: i, n, count_non_zero\n\nWait, but in the third part's loop, the variable 'n' is used as 'num', but in the code above, inside the loop:\n\ninteger :: num = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nAh, yes, that's okay because it's declared inside the loop. But in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements in their scope. So inside the loop:\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n    character(len=1) :: c = s(i:i)\n    integer :: num = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n    counts(num) = counts(num) +1\nend do\n\nThis is okay because the declarations are inside the loop's block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to declare 'num' outside, but inside the loop's scope.\n\nAlternatively, compute it inline.\n\nAlternatively, the code is okay as written.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part's loop, the variable 'c' is declared as a character(len=1). That's okay.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the first example where the first program's input is 3 and 3:\n\nFirst part sum is 3+3=6 (wait no, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait first iteration:\n\na=3, b=3 \u2192 take a (3), sum becomes 3, a becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration: a=2, b=3 \u2192 take b (3), sum becomes 6, b becomes 2.\n\nSo sum is 6.\n\nSecond part: position=6.\n\nAs before, the result2 is 3.\n\nThird part: \"3\" \u2192 output No.\n\nAnother test case where the second program's output is 1212 \u2192 but need to find the position that would give that.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a position where the result is 1122.\n\nSuppose the result2 is 1122 \u2192 then the third program outputs yes.\n\nTo get that, the result2 must be 1122 \u2192 so (position - startIndex) +1 =1122 \u2192 position = startIndex +1121.\n\nSuppose startIndex is 100 \u2192 position is 1221.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nSuppose position is 1221.\n\nFirst loop for second part:\n\nStart with nrst=1.\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <1221 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\ngetValue(4)=7 < \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u2192 getValue(8)=29 < \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21928 \u219216 \u2192 getValue(16)=121 < \u2192 multiply by 2 \u219216 \u219232 \u2192 getValue(32)=497 < \u2192 multiply by 2 \u219232 \u219264 \u2192 getValue(64)=2017>1221 \u2192 so first loop stops at 32.\n\nThen second loop:\n\nnrst=32.\n\nCheck getValue(33)=529 \u22641221 \u2192 increment to 33.\n\nContinue until:\n\nWe need to find the nrst where getValue(nrst+1) >1221.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSuppose nrst is 49 \u2192 getValue(49)=1177.\n\ngetValue(50)=1226>1221 \u2192 so the loop stops at 49.\n\nThus startIndex is 1177.\n\nresult2 = (1221-1177)+1 =45 \u2192 which is 45 \u2192 \"45\" \u2192 counts 4 and 5 \u2192 each 1 \u2192 output No.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother example: let's say the second program's output is 1212 \u2192 then the third program's input is \"1212\" \u2192 which is two characters (1 and 2) each appearing twice \u2192 output yes.\n\nTo get result2=1212, the position must be such that:\n\nresult2 = (position - startIndex) +1 =1212 \u2192 position = startIndex +1211.\n\nSuppose startIndex is 100 \u2192 position is 1311.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nSuppose position is 1311.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nnrst starts at 1.\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 value 2 <1311 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\nContinue until:\n\nAt some point, when nrst=48 \u2192 2*48=96 \u2192 getValue(96)=1+ (96*95)/2 \u2192 1+4560=4561>1311 \u2192 so the first loop would stop at 24?\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nnrst=1 \u2192 2*1=2 \u2192 value 2 <1311 \u2192 multiply to 2.\n\n2 \u2192 4 \u2192 value 7 < \u2192 multiply to 4.\n\n4 \u21928 \u219229 < \u2192 multiply to 8.\n\n8 \u219216 \u2192121 < \u2192 multiply to 16.\n\n16 \u219232 \u2192497 < \u2192 multiply to 32.\n\n32 \u219264 \u21922017>1311 \u2192 so first loop stops at 32.\n\nThen second loop:\n\nnrst=32.\n\nCheck getValue(33)=529 \u22641311 \u2192 increment to 33.\n\nContinue until:\n\nWe need to find the largest nrst where getValue(nrst) \u22641311 and getValue(nrst+1) >1311.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSuppose nrst=50 \u2192 getValue(50)=1226 \u22641311.\n\ngetValue(51)=1226 +51 \u2192 wait no:\n\ngetValue(51) =1 + (51*50)/2 \u2192 1 + 1275 =1276 \u22641311.\n\ngetValue(52)=1 + (52*51)/2 \u2192 1+1326=1327>1311 \u2192 so the nrst would be 51.\n\nThus startIndex = getValue(51)=1276.\n\nresult2 = (1311-1276)+1 =36 \u2192 \"36\" \u2192 output No.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nPerhaps it's better to pick a position where the result is 1122.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nresult2=1122 \u2192 position = startIndex +1121.\n\nSuppose startIndex is 100 \u2192 position=1221.\n\nBut earlier calculation shows that gives result2=45.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. The code seems logically correct, so I'll proceed with the code as written."
