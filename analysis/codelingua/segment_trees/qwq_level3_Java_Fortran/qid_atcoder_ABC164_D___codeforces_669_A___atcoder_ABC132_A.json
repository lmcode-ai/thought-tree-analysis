    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D) reads a string S from input. It calculates some values related to the digits of S modulo 2019 and outputs a count of pairs. The second program (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n, processes it (probably counts something), and outputs a number. The third (atcoder_ABC132_A) checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice, outputting \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut since they are run in sequence, the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. Wait, but the first program outputs a number (ans), which would be the input for the second program. The second program expects an integer n, so that's okay. Then the second's output is another number, which is the input for the third program. But the third expects a string, not a number. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the third program's input is a string, but the second program's output is a number. So maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user said the output of each is used as input to the next. So first program's output is a number (ans), which is the input to the second program. The second program takes that number as n, processes it, outputs another number. Then that number is the input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. So that's a problem. Unless the third program is expecting a string representation of the number. So the second program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the third program. So the third program would read that number as a string, like \"123\", and check if it has two characters each appearing twice. Hmm, but maybe the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a number, so the third program would read that as a string. For example, if the second outputs 22, then the third would get \"22\" as input, which would have two '2's, but the size is 2 characters, so the third would output \"Yes\" only if there are exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. Wait, but \"22\" has one character, so it would output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the user says the sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So I need to make sure that the data flows correctly between the steps without I/O in between. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which is then the input to the third. But in the original Java setup, each program reads from stdin and writes to stdout. So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. So the entire sequence's input is the first's input, and the final output is the third's output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, I need to process the first's input, compute the first's result, then pass that result to the second's computation, then pass that result to the third's computation, and finally output the third's result. All without any intermediate I/O.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the first program's input, which is a string S for the first Java program).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (the ans value from the first Java code).\n\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's n (so the second's n is the first's ans).\n\n4. Compute the second's output (the result from codeforces_669_A's solve function).\n\n5. Use that output as the input to the third program (the string input for the third Java code, which is the number from step 4 converted to a string).\n\n6. Compute the third's output (Yes/No based on the string from step 5).\n\n7. Output the third's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (the string S for the first Java program).\n\n- Process through all three steps in memory, then output the final result.\n\nNow, let's break down each Java program's logic and translate them into Fortran functions or subroutines.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n\nThe first program takes a string S, processes it to compute the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that the substring from i to j (or some similar condition) has a value mod 2019 equal to some value. The code uses an array mod_arr and mod_cnt to track the counts. The final answer is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2), plus 1 for the 0 case.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as an array of 2019 elements, all zero. Then, for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\ntmp is computed as (digit * radix) mod 2019. Then, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019. Then mod_arr[i] is set to tmp mod 2019. Then mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. The radix is updated as (radix *10) mod 2019.\n\nAt the end, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 (so why?), then the answer is sum over i of mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial code counts the number of times each mod value occurs, and then for each mod value, the number of pairs is C(k,2). The mod_cnt[0] is incremented because the empty string? Or maybe the initial condition?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is counting the number of substrings (or some specific substrings) whose value mod 2019 is 0. The way the code works is that for each position i, it's calculating the mod of the number formed by the last i+1 digits (since it's processing from the end). The mod_arr[i] is the value of the substring S[N-1 -i ... N-1] (since it's going from the end). The mod_cnt counts how many times each mod value occurs. Then, the number of pairs is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], so that their difference mod 2019 is 0. Hence, the total pairs is sum over all counts of (count choose 2). But why the mod_cnt[0] is incremented? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. Then the loop over i from 0 to 2018 adds mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2. So the initial mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. That might be because the empty substring (or some base case) is considered as having mod 0. So the code is counting all pairs, including when the mod is 0. So the first program's output is the total number of such pairs.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read the input string S. Then process it as per the code.\n\nNow, the second Java program (codeforces_669_A):\n\nThe second program takes an integer n, and outputs (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod 3 !=0 else 0). Wait, the code's solve function is:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n    System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n}\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n divided by 3 is q, remainder r. Then the formula is q*2 plus 1 if r is not zero. Because when n mod3 is 0, the term is 0, else 1. So for example:\n\nn=3: 3/3=1, mod0 \u2192 1*2 +0 \u21922.\n\nn=4: 4/3=1, mod1 \u21921*2 +1 \u21923.\n\nn=5: 5/3=1, mod2 \u21921*2+1 \u21923.\n\nn=6: 6/3=2 \u21922*2 +0 \u21924.\n\nSo the formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). So the output is the number of pairs of 1 and 2 in the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, perhaps? Not sure, but the code is straightforward.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC132_A):\n\nThis checks if the input string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the string must have length 4, with two pairs. Wait, no, the code counts the frequency of each character. It uses a HashMap to count occurrences. Then, it checks if all entries in the map have value 2, and the map's size is exactly 2. So the string must have exactly two different characters, each appearing exactly two times. So the length must be 4, and the two characters each twice. So for example, \"aabb\" \u2192 yes, \"abba\" \u2192 yes, \"aabc\" \u2192 no (c appears once), \"aaaa\" \u2192 no (only one character), \"ab\" \u2192 no (length 2 but counts are 1 each, but size is 2, but counts are 1 each, so not 2).\n\nSo the third program's output is \"Yes\" if the input string meets those conditions, else \"No\".\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these three steps in Fortran.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the string S for the first program).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (ans1).\n\n3. Use ans1 as the input to the second program, compute ans2.\n\n4. Convert ans2 to a string (since the third program expects a string input), then compute the third's output (ans3).\n\n5. Output ans3.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n- Read the input string S.\n\n- Compute ans1 using the first program's logic.\n\n- Compute ans2 = (ans1 //3)*2 + (1 if mod(ans1,3) !=0 else 0).\n\n- Convert ans2 to a string s2.\n\n- Check if s2 has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (ans1):\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nWe need to process the string S, compute mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe steps for the first part:\n\nInitialize mod_arr as an array of length N (the length of S). mod_cnt is an array of 2019 elements, initialized to 0.\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1 (but in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i<N; i++)... but in the code, the index is N-1 -i, so processing from the end of the string.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 - i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\n    if (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, the first character processed is S.charAt(N-1 -0) = S.charAt(N-1), which is the last character of the string. So the loop is processing the digits from the end of the string, starting with the least significant digit (since it's building the number from the end, using radix which is 10^i mod 2019).\n\nWait, the code is building the number as if the digits are read from the end. Let me think:\n\nEach digit is S's character at position (N-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (the rightmost digit), then i=1 is the second last, etc. So the digits are processed from right to left.\n\nThe tmp is (digit * radix) mod 2019. The radix starts at 1 (for the first digit, which is the rightmost, so 10^0). Then, for each next digit (moving left), the radix is multiplied by 10 mod 2019. So the radix for the next digit is 10^1 mod 2019, etc.\n\nThen, the tmp is added to mod_arr[i-1] (if i !=0). Wait, mod_arr[i-1] is the previous value. So mod_arr[i] is (digit * radix + previous mod value) mod 2019. Wait, no, the code says:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nThen, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, then mod 2019 again.\n\nWait, so mod_arr[i] = (digit * radix + mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019.\n\nAh, so mod_arr[i] represents the value of the substring from the end up to position (N-1 -i), i.e., the substring S[N-1 -i ... N-1], interpreted as a number mod 2019.\n\nTherefore, the mod_arr array holds the mod 2019 of the numbers formed by the last 1, 2, ..., N digits.\n\nThe mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs in mod_arr. Then, the answer is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], plus the cases where mod is 0 (since the empty string? Or perhaps the initial 0 is counted as well).\n\nWait, the code increments mod_cnt[0] by 1 at the end. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. Then the loop over mod_cnt[i] adds (count choose 2). So the initial mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. So perhaps the empty substring is considered as having mod 0, so that any occurrence of mod 0 in mod_arr plus the empty gives an additional pair.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is counting all pairs (including the empty substring). But in any case, the code's logic is as written, so we need to replicate that.\n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N.\n\nmod_cnt is an array of 2019 elements, initialized to 0.\n\nradix = 1\n\ndo i = 0, N-1 (but in Fortran, loops are from 1 to N, perhaps?)\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is from i=0 to N-1 (since i < N). So in Fortran, perhaps we can loop from 1 to N, but adjust indices accordingly.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, the string can be stored as a character array. Let's say S is a character array of length N.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N (since in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default unless specified otherwise), but the Java code's loop is over i from 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, perhaps we can loop from 1 to N, and for each step, the current character is S(N - i +1). Because when i=1, it's the last character (since N -1 +1 = N), then i=2 is N-1, etc.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nthe character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). So for i=0, it's N-1, i=1, N-2, etc.\n\nIn Fortran, if the string is stored as a character array S(1:N), then the equivalent would be S(N - i +1) when i starts at 1. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the loop variable is j from 1 to N. Then, the index in the string would be (N - j +1). For j=1, it's N, j=2, N-1, etc. So that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo j = 1, N\n\n    current_char = S(N - j +1)\n\n    digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n    tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n    if (j > 1) then\n\n        tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(j-1), 2019)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_arr(j) = tmp\n\n    mod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1  ! Because arrays in Fortran start at 1, so mod 0 is index 1?\n\nWait, no. Wait, mod_cnt is an array of 2019 elements. In Java, mod_cnt is 0-based (indices 0 to 2018). In Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. To make it easier, perhaps declare mod_cnt(0:2018). But in Fortran, by default arrays start at 1, so need to specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices. Let me think:\n\nIn Java, mod_cnt is an array of size 2019, indices 0 to 2018. So in Fortran, we can declare mod_cnt(0:2018). So when we do mod_cnt[tmp] +=1, that's okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\nmod_cnt = 0\n\nThen, for each tmp (which can be 0 to 2018), mod_cnt(tmp) is incremented.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nInitialize mod_arr as an array of size N (since N is the length of S). Let's say mod_arr(1:N).\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop over j from 1 to N:\n\ndigit = S(N-j+1) - '0'\n\ntmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif j >1 then:\n\n    tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(j-1), 2019 )\n\nmod_arr(j) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nAfter the loop:\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nans1 = 0\n\ndo i =0, 2018\n\n    ans1 = ans1 + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) -1)/2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the code does mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop over i (from 0 to N-1), the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, the code after the loop:\n\nans =0L;\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2019; i++) {\n\n    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2;\n\n}\n\nAh, so after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. So in Fortran, after the loop over j, we do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1.\n\nThen, compute ans1 as the sum over all mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2 for i from 0 to 2018.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part (ans2):\n\nans2 = (ans1 //3)*2 + (1 if mod(ans1,3) /=0 else 0)\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with negative numbers, but since ans1 is a count, it's non-negative.\n\nSo:\n\nans2 = (ans1 /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(ans1,3)/=0)\n\nAlternatively, using an if statement.\n\nThird part: converting ans2 to a string s2, then check the conditions.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2\n\nwrite(s2, '(I0)') ans2\n\ns2 = adjustl(s2)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process the string s2 to check the conditions.\n\nThe third program's logic is:\n\nCheck that the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each character in s2.\n\n2. Check that there are exactly two distinct characters.\n\n3. Each of those has a count of exactly 2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, get the length of s2. Let's say len_trim(s2) gives the actual length.\n\nBut first, after writing ans2 to s2, we need to trim leading spaces. So:\n\ns2 = adjustl(s2)\n\nn_chars = len_trim(s2)\n\nif (n_chars /=4) then, it can't be yes (since 2 characters each twice is 4 characters). Wait, but maybe the number could be shorter? Like if ans2 is 12, then the string is \"12\" (length 2). Then the counts would be 1 and 1, but two distinct characters, but each appears once. So the third program would output \"No\".\n\nSo the first check is that the length is exactly 4? No, the third program's code doesn't check the length. It just checks that all characters have count 2 and there are exactly two distinct.\n\nWait, the third program's code:\n\nThe code uses a HashMap to count each character's occurrence. Then, it loops over all entries in the map. If any entry's count is not 2, then ok is false. Also, the map's size must be exactly 2.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The number of distinct characters is exactly 2.\n\n- Each of those has a count of exactly 2.\n\nThus, the length of the string must be 4 (since 2*2=4). So if the string's length is not 4, then it's automatically \"No\".\n\nSo in Fortran, first check the length of s2. If it's not 4, then output \"No\".\n\nElse, proceed to count the characters.\n\nSo steps:\n\nn = len_trim(s2)\n\nif (n /=4) then\n\n    ans3 = \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n    count the characters.\n\n    check if exactly two distinct, each count 2.\n\nend if\n\nSo in code:\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: s = s2(1:4)  ! Assuming s2 is adjusted and has length 4.\n\ninteger :: count(256) = 0  ! Assuming ASCII, but maybe better to use a hash.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps using an array for counts.\n\nAlternatively, since characters are limited (digits?), but the third program's input is a number converted to a string, so the characters are digits (0-9). So the possible characters are 0-9, so 10 possibilities.\n\nSo we can have an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) to count.\n\nWait, but the third program's input could be any string, but in our case, it's the output of the second program, which is a number. So the string s2 is a sequence of digits. So the characters are 0-9.\n\nThus, we can use an array of size 10 (indices 0-9) to count each digit's occurrence.\n\nInitialize count(0:9) =0\n\ndo i=1,4\n\n    c = ichar(s(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n    count(c) = count(c) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, check:\n\nnumber_of_distinct = 0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n    if (count(i) >0) then\n\n        number_of_distinct = number_of_distinct +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (number_of_distinct /=2) then\n\n    ans3 = \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n    check each of the two counts are 2.\n\n    flag = .true.\n\n    do i=0,9\n\n        if (count(i) ==2) then\n\n            continue\n\n        elseif (count(i) ==0) then\n\n            continue\n\n        else\n\n            flag = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (flag) then\n\n        ans3 = \"Yes\"\n\n    else\n\n        ans3 = \"No\"\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, since there are exactly two non-zero counts, each must be 2.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the counts, check that exactly two of the counts are 2, and the rest are 0.\n\nWait, but the two counts must be exactly 2 each, and the other counts zero.\n\nSo:\n\nsum_counts = sum(count(0:9))\n\nif (sum_counts /=4) then \u2192 but since the length is 4, sum is 4.\n\nBut the two counts must be 2 each. So:\n\nnumber_of_2 =0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n    if (count(i) ==2) then\n\n        number_of_2 = number_of_2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (number_of_2 ==2) then \u2192 yes.\n\nElse no.\n\nSo that's another way.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ninteger :: count(0:9) =0\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: s\n\ns = adjustl(s2)\n\nif (len_trim(s2) /=4) then\n\n    ans3 = \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n    s = s2(1:4)\n\n    do i=1,4\n\n        c = ichar(s(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n        count(c) = count(c)+1\n\n    end do\n\n    num_2 =0\n\n    do i=0,9\n\n        if (count(i) ==2) then\n\n            num_2 = num_2 +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (num_2 ==2) then\n\n        ans3 = \"Yes\"\n\n    else\n\n        ans3 = \"No\"\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but need to ensure that there are exactly two distinct characters. Because if a count is 4, then num_2 would be 0, so it would be \"No\".\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string S.\n\n2. Compute ans1 via the first program's logic.\n\n3. Compute ans2 = (ans1//3)*2 + (1 if mod(ans1,3) !=0 else 0).\n\n4. Convert ans2 to a string s2.\n\n5. Process s2 to get ans3 (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n6. Output ans3.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the input:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: S  ! Assuming the input string is up to 200 characters.\n\nread(*,'(A)') S\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nThen, process the first part.\n\nallocate mod_arr(1:N), mod_cnt(0:2018)\n\nmod_arr =0\n\nmod_cnt =0\n\nradix =1\n\ndo j=1,N\n\n    current_char = S(N-j+1:N-j+1)  ! substring from position N-j+1 to N-j+1 (single character)\n\n    digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n    tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n    if (j >1) then\n\n        tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(j-1), 2019)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_arr(j) = tmp\n\n    mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n    radix = mod(radix *10, 2019)\n\nend do\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nans1 =0\n\ndo i=0,2018\n\n    ans1 = ans1 + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\nThen compute ans2:\n\nans2 = (ans1 /3)*2\n\nif (mod(ans1,3) /=0) ans2 = ans2 +1\n\nThen convert ans2 to a string s2:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s2\n\nwrite(s2, '(I0)') ans2\n\ns2 = adjustl(s2)\n\nThen process s2:\n\nif (len_trim(s2) /=4) then\n\n    ans3 = \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n    ! process the 4 characters\n\n    character(len=4) :: s = s2(1:4)\n\n    integer :: count(0:9) =0\n\n    do i=1,4\n\n        c = ichar(s(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n        count(c) = count(c)+1\n\n    end do\n\n    integer :: num_2 =0\n\n    do i=0,9\n\n        if (count(i) ==2) then\n\n            num_2 = num_2 +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (num_2 ==2) then\n\n        ans3 = \"Yes\"\n\n    else\n\n        ans3 = \"No\"\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nFinally, print ans3:\n\nprint *, ans3\n\nNow, putting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nBut need to handle arrays properly. Also, in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with appropriate sizes.\n\nWait, in the first part, mod_arr is of size N, which is variable. So we need to use an allocatable array.\n\nThus, the code would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=200) :: S\n    integer :: N, ans1, ans2\n    character(len=20) :: s2\n    character(len=4) :: s\n    integer :: count(0:9)\n    character(len=3) :: ans3\n    integer, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n    integer :: mod_cnt(0:2018)\n    integer :: radix, tmp, j, i, num_2\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,'(A)') S\n    N = len_trim(S)\n\n    ! First part: compute ans1\n    allocate(mod_arr(N))\n    mod_arr = 0\n    mod_cnt = 0\n    radix = 1\n\n    do j = 1, N\n        ! Get the j-th character from the end (current_char)\n        character(len=1) :: current_char\n        current_char = S(N - j + 1 : N - j + 1)\n        integer :: digit\n        digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n        tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n        if (j > 1) then\n            tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(j-1), 2019)\n        end if\n        mod_arr(j) = tmp\n        mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) + 1\n        radix = mod(radix * 10, 2019)\n    end do\n\n    mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) + 1\n    ans1 = 0\n    do i = 0, 2018\n        ans1 = ans1 + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) - 1) / 2\n    end do\n\n    ! Second part: compute ans2\n    ans2 = (ans1 / 3) * 2\n    if (mod(ans1, 3) /= 0) then\n        ans2 = ans2 + 1\n    end if\n\n    ! Convert ans2 to string s2\n    write(s2, '(I0)') ans2\n    s2 = adjustl(s2)\n\n    ! Third part: compute ans3\n    if (len_trim(s2) /= 4) then\n        ans3 = \"No\"\n    else\n        s = s2(1:4)\n        count = 0\n        do i = 1, 4\n            integer :: c\n            c = ichar(s(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n            count(c) = count(c) + 1\n        end do\n        num_2 = 0\n        do i = 0, 9\n            if (count(i) == 2) then\n                num_2 = num_2 + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (num_2 == 2) then\n            ans3 = \"Yes\"\n        else\n            ans3 = \"No\"\n        end if\n    end if\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, ans3\n\n    deallocate(mod_arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the third part, the string s2 may have leading zeros? For example, if ans2 is 12, then s2 would be \"12\", which has length 2. So the code correctly checks the length and returns \"No\".\n\nAnother test case: if ans2 is 22, then s2 is \"22\", length 2 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nIf ans2 is 1221 \u2192 length 4. Then counts for '1' and '2' are 2 each \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nWait, \"1221\" has two '1's and two '2's \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: \"1122\" \u2192 yes.\n\n\"1111\" \u2192 counts for '1' is 4 \u2192 num_2 is 0 \u2192 no.\n\n\"1234\" \u2192 counts are 1 each \u2192 num_2 is 0 \u2192 no.\n\n\"1123\" \u2192 counts: 2,1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nIn the first part, the mod_arr is allocated as N elements. Since N is the length of the input string, which can be up to 200 (as per the declared length of S). But in the first program's Java code, the string can be up to 1e5 characters? Wait, but the problem says the original Java programs are to be translated. The first Java program's code uses an array of size N, which could be up to the length of S. But in the problem statement, the user says \"the same behavior\", so the Fortran code must handle the same input constraints as the original Java code. However, in the problem's context, perhaps the input S is within a manageable size (since the first Java program's code uses an array of N elements, which in Java can handle large N, but in Fortran, with allocatable arrays, it's okay as long as memory is sufficient).\n\nAnother point: in the first part, the mod_cnt array is declared as 0:2018, which is correct.\n\nAlso, in the first loop, the current_char is correctly taken from the end of the string.\n\nThe code for the second part is straightforward.\n\nThe third part's count array is 0:9, which covers digits 0-9.\n\nThe final output is ans3, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- In the first part, when converting the character to digit, if the input has non-digit characters, but according to the first Java program's input, S is a string of digits? Or not? The first Java program's code reads a string S, which can be any characters, but the code processes them as digits. So if the input has non-digit characters, the code would treat them as their ASCII values minus '0', which could lead to negative numbers or invalid digits. But the problem's original code may assume that S is a string of digits. Since the problem says to translate the sequence, we must assume that the input to the first program is valid (i.e., S is a string of digits). So the Fortran code can proceed under that assumption.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, the mod function in Fortran may return negative values if the first argument is negative. But in the code, digit is the character's value minus '0', so if the character is a digit, digit is between 0-9. So digit * radix is non-negative. Thus, mod(digit * radix, 2019) will be between 0 and 2018. So that's okay.\n\nThe radix is initialized to 1, and multiplied by 10 mod 2019 each step, so stays positive.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's write the final Fortran code."
