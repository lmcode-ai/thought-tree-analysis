    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_379_A) takes two integers a and b from input. It calculates a result by repeatedly dividing a by b, adding the quotient to res, and updating a to be the quotient plus remainder until a is less than b. The output is the final res. So this is the first step, and its output is the input for the next program.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_96_B) takes a number (probably the res from the first program) and finds the smallest number composed of 4's and 7's such that the count of 4's equals the count of 7's, and the number is >= the input. The output here is that number, which then becomes the input for the third program.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an integer x (from the second's output) and finds the smallest odd prime number greater than or equal to x. If x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1. Then it checks primes by incrementing x by 2 each time until it finds a prime. The final output is this prime.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (a and b), process through all three steps, and output the final result. The key is to chain the outputs without I/O in between.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read a and b from input (first step's input).\n2. Compute the first result (res) as per the first Java code.\n3. Use that res as the input to the second step, which computes the 4/7 number.\n4. Use that number as input to the third step, which finds the prime.\n5. Finally, print the prime.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran functions or subroutines, ensuring data flows correctly.\n\nStarting with the first part (codeforces_379_A):\n\nThe first Java code's main logic is straightforward. Let's write a function that takes a and b and returns res. In Fortran, variables are passed by reference, but since we can compute it step by step, perhaps we can just compute it in the main program.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables are global unless specified otherwise. Hmm, but better to structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, in the main program:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then compute res as per the loop.\n\nThe loop in Java is:\n\nres starts as a. Then while a >= b:\n\nres += a/b, then a becomes (a/b) + (a%b). Wait, in Java, a is being modified each time. So in Fortran, we can do the same:\n\nInitialize res = a. Then loop while a >= b:\n\ntemp = a / b\n\nres = res + temp\n\nremainder = mod(a, b)\n\na = temp + remainder\n\nWait, but in Java, a is updated each time. So in Fortran, variables a and b are integers. Let me code that.\n\nSecond part (codeforces_96_B):\n\nThe second Java code takes a number (the res from first step) and finds the smallest number made of 4 and 7 with equal counts, and >= the input.\n\nThe approach in Java is to loop mask starting from 2, convert to binary, check if the number of 0's equals 1's (since in binary, the substring after first character is considered, but maybe the mask is being used to generate binary strings with equal 0 and 1 counts? Wait, the code in Java does:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time. Then converts mask to binary string, takes substring(1), which removes the first character. Then counts zeros in that substring. The condition is zeros != (length - zeros). Wait, no, the code says if zeros != (s.length - zeros), then continue. Wait, the condition is: if the number of zeros is not equal to the number of 1's (since total digits is length, so zeros + ones = length. So if zeros != (length - zeros), then it's not equal. So the code skips those where the zeros and ones are not equal. So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0 and 1 counts. Then, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as long, and check if that value is >= the input number. The first such value is the answer.\n\nWait, but the mask starts at 2, and the binary string is mask's binary, then substring(1). So for mask=2 (binary 10), substring(1) is '0', which has 1 zero and 0 ones. So zeros (1) is not equal to (length - zeros) (0). So it skips. Hmm, maybe the mask is being used to generate binary numbers with equal 0 and 1 counts, but the code is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mask is being used to generate numbers with equal 0 and 1 bits in their binary representations (excluding the leading 1?), but the code is generating all possible binary numbers with equal 0 and 1 counts, then converting to 4 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mask is being used to generate all possible binary numbers with equal 0 and 1 counts, but the code is generating them in some order. The loop continues until the generated value (after replacing 0 and 1) is >= the input number. The first such value is the answer.\n\nHmm, this part might be a bit tricky in Fortran. Let's think of how to implement this.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\nGiven the input number (from first step's res), we need to find the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 with equal counts, and >= input.\n\nThe approach in Java is to generate binary numbers (starting from mask=2, but perhaps the mask is not the right way to generate all possible candidates). Alternatively, perhaps the code is generating all possible binary numbers (excluding leading zeros?), then checking for equal 0 and 1 counts, then converting to 4 and 7.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses mask starting at 2, converts to binary string, then takes substring(1). So for mask=2 (binary '10'), substring(1) is '0', which is length 1. So zeros=1, so zeros != (1 - zeros) (0). So it skips. Then mask increments to 3 (binary '11'), substring(1) is '1', zeros=0, so 0 vs 1 (length is 1). Not equal. So skips. mask=4 (binary '100'), substring(1) is '00', zeros=2, length is 2. So zeros equals length - zeros (2 vs 0?), no. Wait, 2 zeros, so length is 2. So zeros (2) equals (2 - 2) =0? No. So that's not equal. Hmm, maybe the code is not generating the correct candidates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is wrong, but I have to translate it as is. Wait, perhaps the code is intended to generate all possible binary numbers (without leading zeros?), but the way it's done here may not be the most efficient. But regardless, I have to translate the logic exactly.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nmask starts at 2, then mask increments each time. The binary string is of mask, then substring(1). So for mask=3 (binary '11'), substring(1) is '1', so length 1. So zeros=0, so 0 != 1-0 (1). So skips. mask=5 (binary '101'), substring(1) is '01', zeros=1, length 2. 1 vs 1 (since 2-1=1). So yes, equal. So then the string becomes '01' \u2192 replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927 \u2192 '47', which is 47. So that's a candidate. So the code would check if 47 is >= the input number. If so, that's the answer.\n\nSo the code is generating all possible binary numbers (excluding the first character of the binary string of mask), then checking if the number of 0's equals the number of 1's. If so, then replace 0\u21924 and 1\u21927, parse as a number, and track the first such number that is >= the input.\n\nThe problem is that the mask is being used to generate the binary strings, but perhaps this is not the most efficient way. However, the code is written this way, so I have to replicate it in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, to handle this, I need to loop mask from 2 upwards, each time:\n\n1. Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting at second character (since Java's substring(1) is from index 1, which is the second character in 0-based).\n\n2. Count the number of '0's in that substring.\n\n3. Check if the count of zeros equals the number of '1's (since total length is len, zeros + ones = len \u2192 zeros = (len - zeros) \u2192 so zeros must equal (len - zeros) \u2192 2*zeros = len \u2192 len must be even. So the substring must have even length, and zeros equal to half the length.\n\nWait, the condition in the code is:\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\nWhich is equivalent to if (zeros != (length - zeros)), then skip. So only proceed if zeros equals (length - zeros). So the total length must be even, and zeros must be exactly half.\n\nSo the substring must have an even length, and exactly half zeros and half ones.\n\nSo the code is generating all possible binary strings (from mask's binary, excluding first character) that have equal 0 and 1 counts, then converting to 4 and 7, and finding the first such number >= input.\n\nHmm, but how to implement this in Fortran?\n\nFirst, for each mask starting at 2, loop:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string. Let's see, in Fortran, converting an integer to a binary string can be done with a function. Alternatively, we can build the string manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the binary digits, but for the purpose of this code, let's think of a way to get the binary string of mask, then substring from the second character.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to get the binary string of an integer, perhaps using a function. Let me think of writing a helper function to convert an integer to a binary string.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nFunction to convert integer to binary string (without leading zeros except for zero itself):\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  CHARACTER(LEN=80) :: bin_str\n  INTEGER :: i, len\n  bin_str = ''\n  IF (n == 0) THEN\n    bin_str = '0'\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  DO i = 1, 80\n    bin_str(i:i) = '0' + MOD(n,2)\n    n = n / 2\n    IF (n == 0) EXIT\n  END DO\n  ! Reverse the string\n  len = LEN_TRIM(bin_str)\n  bin_str = REVERSE(bin_str(1:len))\nEND FUNCTION int_to_bin\n\nWait, but this might need some adjustments. Alternatively, perhaps using a loop to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the intrinsic function BTEST, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the purpose of this problem, since mask can be up to some value, but in practice, the mask may not be too big, but in codeforces_96_B, the input number can be up to 1e18, so the mask could be large. Hmm, but in Fortran, handling very large integers (like mask up to 2^60) may be an issue, but perhaps the code can proceed with integers as 64-bit (using INTEGER(8)).\n\nWait, in the second Java code, the mask is an integer, but when converted to binary, the substring is taken. The mask is incremented each time. So in Fortran, mask can be an INTEGER(8) (since in Java it's an int, but the code uses mask++ which can go up to very large numbers, but in the problem's context, perhaps the mask is manageable).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mask can be a 64-bit integer in Fortran.\n\nSo, in the second part's code:\n\nInitialize ans = -1, value =0, mask starts at 2.\n\nLoop while value < input_number (from first step's res):\n\n- Get the binary string of mask, then substring starting from the second character (since in Java it's substring(1)).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the string is built as a character array. Let's say the binary string is s. Then the substring is s(2: len(s)), but need to check the length.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the binary string is obtained via Integer.toBinaryString(mask), which for mask=2 is \"10\", so substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nSo in Fortran, after getting the binary string (without leading zeros), the substring is from the second character.\n\nSo, for mask=2, the binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nSo in Fortran, after getting the binary string, we can take s(2: len_trim(s)).\n\nOnce we have the substring, count the number of '0's.\n\nThen check if zeros == (length of substring - zeros). If not, skip.\n\nElse, replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's, then convert to a number.\n\nCompare that number to the input. If it's >=, then track the minimum such value.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code is:\n\nvalue = Long.parseLong(s);\n\nand then if that value is >= number (the input), then ans is set to value, but actually, the code is written as:\n\nans is initialized to -1, but in the loop, it's not used. Wait, looking back at the Java code for the second file:\n\nWait the code in the second file:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nmask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   s = s.replace('0', '4');\n\n   s = s.replace('1', '7');\n\n   value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nInside the loop, after processing, the code does:\n\nvalue = Long.parseLong(s);\n\nthen, if the condition is met (the zeros and ones are equal), then the code proceeds to set value, but the loop continues until value is >= number?\n\nWait, no, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   s is processed, then value is set to the parsed s.\n\n   but the loop continues until value is >= number?\n\nWait, no, the loop is while (value < number). So the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. Wait, but the code inside the loop is:\n\nmask starts at 2, and increments each time. The code inside the loop:\n\ns = binary string of mask, substring(1).\n\nthen count zeros.\n\nif zeros != (length - zeros), continue (so skip the rest of the loop body).\n\nElse, replace 0\u21924 and 1\u21927, then parse to value.\n\nThen, after that, the loop continues. Wait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input number. So the code is trying to find the first value (from the generated numbers) that is >= the input number. Because once value is >=, the loop exits, and then the code prints value.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is structured as:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... \n\n   compute s, then if the condition is met, set value to the parsed s.\n\n   else, continue (so the value remains 0?)\n\nWait, no, the code's structure is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask is incremented each time.\n\nThen, the code processes the mask's binary string.\n\nIf the condition (zeros equal to ones) is not met, then the code skips to the end of the loop body (continue), so the value is not updated. So the value remains as it was before (initially 0, then maybe previous value).\n\nWait, but in the code, after the continue, the code proceeds to the next iteration.\n\nWait, the code inside the loop is:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nint zeros = 0;\n\nfor (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\n// else:\n\ns = s.replace('0', '4');\n\ns = s.replace('1', '7');\n\nvalue = Long.parseLong(s);\n\nSo, if the condition is met, then the code proceeds to replace and set value. Otherwise, it skips to the next iteration (the continue skips the rest of the loop body).\n\nSo, the value is only updated when the condition is met. Otherwise, the value remains as it was before (initially 0, then whatever it was set to before).\n\nThe loop continues while value < number. So the loop will keep running until the value is set to a value >= number. Because once that happens, the loop condition (value < number) is false, so the loop exits.\n\nTherefore, the first time the generated value (from the valid s) is >= number, the loop exits, and that value is the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct in that way.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nInitialize mask = 2, value =0.\n\nLoop while value < input_number:\n\n   s = binary string of mask, then substring starting at second character.\n\n   count zeros in s.\n\n   if zeros != (length of s - zeros), then mask +=1, continue loop.\n\n   else:\n\n      replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7 in s.\n\n      convert s to a number (value).\n\n      if this new value is >= input_number, then break the loop.\n\n   mask +=1\n\nWait, but in the code, mask is incremented via mask++ in the first line. So in Fortran, mask starts at 2, then in each iteration, after processing, mask is incremented.\n\nWait, in the Java code, mask is incremented in the line:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nSo mask is first used, then incremented. So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nmask = 2\n\nloop:\n\n   s = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   s = s(2: len_trim(s))\n\n   ... process s.\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nSo the mask is first used, then incremented.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\nDO\n\n   s = int_to_bin(mask)\n\n   s = s(2: len_trim(s))\n\n   ... process.\n\n   if (condition met):\n\n      ... compute new value.\n\n      if (value >= input_number) exit loop.\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nLOOP UNTIL (value >= input_number)\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < input_number). So in Fortran, perhaps a DO loop with a condition.\n\nAlternatively, a loop that runs indefinitely until the value is found.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex, but manageable.\n\nNow, the third part (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nThe third Java code takes an integer x (from the second step's output) and finds the smallest odd prime >= x. If x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1. Then, it checks each odd number starting from there, incrementing by 2 each time, until it finds a prime.\n\nThe prime check is done by checking divisibility up to sqrt(x). For each candidate x, check if divisible by any odd number from 3 to sqrt(x), stepping by 2.\n\nIn Fortran, implementing this:\n\nFunction to check if a number is prime.\n\nFUNCTION is_prime(n) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  INTEGER :: i, sqrt_n\n  IF (n <= 1) THEN\n    res = .FALSE.\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  IF (n == 2) THEN\n    res = .TRUE.\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  IF (MOD(n,2) == 0) THEN\n    res = .FALSE.\n    RETURN\n  END IF\n  sqrt_n = INT(SQRT(REAL(n))) +1\n  DO i = 3, sqrt_n, 2\n    IF (MOD(n,i) == 0) THEN\n      res = .FALSE.\n      RETURN\n    END IF\n  END DO\n  res = .TRUE.\nEND FUNCTION is_prime\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop for checking is:\n\nfor (i =3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n   if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n}\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) then it's prime.\n\nSo the code in Java breaks the loop early if a divisor is found, and if not, then it's prime.\n\nSo the Fortran function can be written as above.\n\nNow, the main steps for the third part:\n\nGiven x (from second step's output):\n\nif x is 2, then output 2.\n\nElse if x is even, set x to x+1 (since 2 is the only even prime, and if x is even and not 2, then start at x+1 which is odd).\n\nThen loop:\n\nCheck if x is prime. If yes, break. Else, add 2 and check again.\n\nSo in code:\n\nx = input (from second step)\n\nIF (x ==2) THEN\n\n   result =2\n\nELSE IF (MOD(x,2) ==0) THEN\n\n   x =x+1\n\nEND IF\n\nDO\n\n   IF (is_prime(x)) THEN\n\n      result =x\n\n      EXIT\n\n   ELSE\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   END IF\n\nLOOP\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is a while(true) loop. The code increments x by 2 each time until it finds a prime.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop can be:\n\nDO\n\n   IF (is_prime(x)) THEN\n\n      EXIT\n\n   ELSE\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   END IF\n\nLOOP\n\nBut need to handle the initial x.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute res (first step).\n\nThen compute the second step's value (the 4/7 number).\n\nThen compute the third step's prime.\n\nFinally, print the prime.\n\nNow, putting all into code.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nIn the first step, variables a and b are integers. The result is res.\n\nSecond step's input is res (from first step). The output is the value (the 4/7 number).\n\nThird step's input is that value, and outputs the prime.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nPROGRAM main\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: a, b, res, x, prime_result\n\nINTEGER(8) :: value_second_step\n\n!

Then len is 2.\n\nThen bin_str is reversed to '10'.\n\nSo s would be '10', then temp_s is s(2:), which is '0'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: mask=3 (binary '11'):\n\nn=3 \u2192 mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str(1) = '1'\n\nn=1 \u2192 mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str(2) = '1'\n\nn=0 \u2192 exit.\n\nbin_str is '11', reversed \u2192 '11'.\n\ntemp_s is s(2:), which is '1'.\n\nzeros count is 0 \u2192 0 vs 1 (length 1). Not equal \u2192 so condition not met \u2192 mask increments.\n\nAnother test: mask=5 (binary '101'):\n\nbinary is '101', so s is '101'.\n\ntemp_s is s(2:) \u2192 '01'.\n\nzeros count is 1, length 2 \u2192 1 == 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen replaced to '47', which is 47.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the third step's code.\n\nThe third step's input is value_second_step (the 4/7 number).\n\nThe code for the third step:\n\nx = value_second_step\n\nif x is 2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nElse if even \u2192 x +=1.\n\nThen loop until find prime.\n\nThe function is_prime is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The int_to_bin function must return the correct binary string.\n\n- The replacement of characters in temp_s must be done correctly.\n\n- The reading of the string into value_second_step must be correct. Since the string is composed of '4's and '7's, it's a valid number.\n\n- The mask must be of type INTEGER(8) to handle large numbers.\n\n- The variables in the second step must be 64-bit (value_second_step is INTEGER(8)).\n\nNow, in the code, the variables:\n\nres is an integer (from first step, which is up to a and b which are integers, but the loop can accumulate res to be large, but in Java it's int, so in Fortran, res can be INTEGER (since in Java it's int, but the problem may have constraints).\n\nWait, the first Java code uses int for a and b, so the maximum res could be up to (a starts as a, and each step adds a/b, which could be up to a/b steps. But in Fortran, using default integers (4 bytes) may be sufficient unless a and b are very large. But since the problem may have constraints, but the user hasn't specified, so assuming that the first step's res is within 32-bit.\n\nThe second step's value_second_step is an 8-byte integer.\n\nThe third step's x is an 8-byte integer (since it can be up to 1e18).\n\nWait, in the third step's code, the input x is value_second_step (which is 8-byte), so x must be declared as INTEGER(8).\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, x is declared as INTEGER, but that's a problem. Let me check:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nINTEGER :: a, b, res, x, prime_result\n\nBut x is the input to the third step, which is value_second_step (an 8-byte integer). So x must be INTEGER(8).\n\nSimilarly, prime_result is the output, which is an integer (since primes can be up to 1e18, so needs to be 8-byte).\n\nSo need to adjust variable declarations.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\nPROGRAM main\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: a, b, res\n\nINTEGER(8) :: value_second_step, x, prime_result\n\nINTEGER(8) :: mask, value, zeros, len_s\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=80) :: s, temp_s\n\n...\n\nThen, in the third step:\n\nx = value_second_step\n\nIF (x ==2) THEN\n\n   prime_result =2\n\nELSE IF (MOD(x,2) ==0) THEN\n\n   x =x +1\n\nEND IF\n\nDO\n\n   IF (is_prime(x)) THEN\n\n      prime_result =x\n\n      EXIT\n\n   ELSE\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   END IF\n\nEND DO\n\nBut the function is_prime takes an INTEGER (not 8-byte). So need to adjust the function to take an 8-byte integer.\n\nWait, the third step's x is an 8-byte integer, so the is_prime function must accept an 8-byte integer.\n\nSo the function is_prime must be modified to take an INTEGER(8) argument.\n\nSo:\n\nFUNCTION is_prime(n) RESULT(res)\n\n  INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: n\n\n  LOGICAL :: res\n\n  INTEGER(8) :: i, sqrt_n\n\n  IF (n <=1) THEN\n\n     res = .FALSE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  IF (n ==2) THEN\n\n     res = .TRUE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  IF (MOD(n,2_8) ==0) THEN\n\n     res = .FALSE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  sqrt_n = INT(SQRT(REAL(n))) +1\n\n  DO i =3_8, sqrt_n, 2_8\n\n     IF (MOD(n,i) ==0_8) THEN\n\n        res = .FALSE.\n\n        RETURN\n\n     END IF\n\n  END DO\n\n  res = .TRUE.\n\nEND FUNCTION is_prime\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the MOD function can handle 8-byte integers. So the function needs to have n as 8-byte.\n\nThus, the function is_prime must be adjusted.\n\nAlso, in the loop for checking primes:\n\nThe loop variable i must be 8-byte as well.\n\nSo in the function:\n\nFUNCTION is_prime(n) RESULT(res)\n\n  INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: n\n\n  LOGICAL :: res\n\n  INTEGER(8) :: i, sqrt_n\n\n  IF (n <=1) THEN\n\n     res = .FALSE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  IF (n ==2) THEN\n\n     res = .TRUE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  IF (MOD(n,2_8) ==0) THEN\n\n     res = .FALSE.\n\n     RETURN\n\n  END IF\n\n  sqrt_n = INT(SQRT(REAL(n))) +1_8\n\n  DO i =3_8, sqrt_n, 2_8\n\n     IF (MOD(n,i) ==0_8) THEN\n\n        res = .FALSE.\n\n        RETURN\n\n     END IF\n\n  END DO\n\n  res = .TRUE.\n\nEND FUNCTION is_prime\n\nWait, but SQRT(REAL(n)) returns a real, so INT converts to default integer. But if n is very large (like 1e18), then sqrt(n) is about 1e9, which is within 32-bit integer (since 2^31 is ~2e9). So INT(SQRT(REAL(n))) is okay.\n\nThus, the function should work.\n\nNow, in the third step's loop:\n\nx is an 8-byte integer. The loop increments by 2 each time.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together with corrected variable types.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second step's loop, the mask is an 8-byte integer, and the binary conversion function must handle 8-byte integers.\n\nThe int_to_bin function's argument is n of type INTEGER(8).\n\nThus, the function is okay.\n\nNow, the code should be:\n\nPROGRAM main\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: a, b, res\n\nINTEGER(8) :: value_second_step, x, prime_result\n\nINTEGER(8) :: mask, zeros, len_s\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=80) :: s, temp_s\n\n!

That should reverse the string correctly.\n\nTesting with mask=2:\n\nbin_str after the loop is '01', then reversed to '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: mask=5 (binary '101'):\n\nThe loop for n=5:\n\nn=5 \u2192 mod(5,2)=1 \u2192 '1'\n\nn=2 \u2192 mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 '0'\n\nn=1 \u2192 mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 '1'\n\nn=0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo bin_str is '101' (after reversal of '101' \u2192 wait, the initial string after the loop is '101'?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=5:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ni=1: mod(5,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str(1) = '1'\n\nn becomes 5//2 =2.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nmod(2,2)=0 \u2192 bin_str(2) = '0'\n\nn becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nmod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str(3) = '1'\n\nn becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo the bin_str after the loop is '101' (positions 1-3), then reversed? Wait no, the loop builds the string in reverse order.\n\nWait, the first digit (LSB) is stored first. So the string after the loop is '101' (for n=5, the binary is '101', so the loop builds '1' (LSB), then '0', then '1' (MSB). So the string is '101', but the actual binary is '101', so no reversal needed?\n\nWait, no, the loop is:\n\nEach step appends the remainder (LSB first). So for n=5 (binary 101):\n\nThe remainders are 1 (5 mod2), then 0 (2 mod2), then 1 (1 mod2). So the string is built as '1','0','1', so the string is '101', which is correct. So the reversal is not needed?\n\nWait, this is conflicting with previous analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nThe loop for n=5:\n\nInitial n=5.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nmod(5,2) =1 \u2192 bin_str(1) = '1'\n\nn =5//2 =2.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nmod(2,2)=0 \u2192 bin_str(2) = '0'\n\nn=1.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nmod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str(3) = '1'\n\nn=0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo the bin_str after the loop is '101' (positions 1-3). The length is 3.\n\nThen, the function reverses it to bin_str(3:1:-1) \u2192 '101' \u2192 same as before.\n\nWait, so the reversal is unnecessary here. But for n=2:\n\nThe loop gives '01', then reversed to '10', which is correct.\n\nAh, so the reversal is needed because the loop builds the string in reverse order (LSB first). So for n=5, the loop builds '101', which is correct, so the reversal is not needed. Wait, but the code reverses it anyway.\n\nWait, the code in the function:\n\nbin_str = bin_str(len:1:-1)\n\nSo for n=5, the bin_str after the loop is '101', then reversed to '101' \u2192 same.\n\nFor n=2, the loop gives '01', reversed to '10' \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the reversal is correct.\n\nThus, the function works.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second step's loop, the mask is incremented by 1 each time, but in the code, after processing, if the condition is met and the value is less than res, then mask is incremented. But in the loop, the mask is always incremented except when the condition is met and the value is sufficient.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter processing the mask:\n\nif the condition is met (zeros equal to ones):\n\n   compute value_second_step.\n\n   if value_second_step >= res \u2192 exit loop.\n\n   else \u2192 mask +=1 and continue.\n\nElse:\n\n   mask +=1 and continue.\n\nThus, the mask is always incremented except when the value is sufficient.\n\nThus, the loop will eventually find the correct value.\n\nNow, the final code should be as above."
