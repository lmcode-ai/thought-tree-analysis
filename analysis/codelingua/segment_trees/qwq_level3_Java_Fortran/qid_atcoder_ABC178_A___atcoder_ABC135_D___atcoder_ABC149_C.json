    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer input X from the user. It checks if X is 1, then inverts that boolean to get a result (so if X is 1, result is 0; else 1). Then it prints the result. But since this is part of a sequence, the output here would be the input for the next program. Wait, but the user said the entire sequence should be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. The final output is the third's result. But in the Fortran program, I need to chain them all together without I/O in the middle.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say: Only the first block should handle reading input, only the last producing output. So the first Java program's input is the user's input, and its output is the input to the second Java program. The second's output is input to the third, and the third's output is the final output. So in the Fortran program, I need to process all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading from stdin and the last writing to stdout. The intermediate steps must process data in memory.\n\nSo first, I need to figure out the data flow between the three Java programs. Let's see:\n\nFirst program (File1) takes an integer X from input. The result is 0 if X is 1, else 1. So the output of File1 is either 0 or 1. That becomes the input to File2. Wait, but File2 expects input from the user. Wait, no, in the original sequence, the output of File1 is the input to File2. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. But looking at File2's code, it reads a string (Scanner sc.next()), so the input to File2 is a string. Wait, but the first program outputs an integer (0 or 1). So the input to File2 is that integer as a string? Because in the sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (0 or 1), which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string (since it's using sc.next().toCharArray()).\n\nWait, but the second Java program (File2) is expecting a string input. So the first program's output (0 or 1) is the input to the second program. So the second program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\". Then the second program processes that string (as a sequence of characters) and outputs a number (the dp[...][5] value). Then that number is the input to the third program (File3), which takes an integer X, and outputs the next prime number >= X (or something like that).\n\nWait, let me check each program's input and output:\n\nFile1:\nInput: integer X (from user)\nOutput: 0 or 1 (printed)\n\nFile2:\nInput: a string (from previous program's output, which is either \"0\" or \"1\")\nOutput: a number (the count mod 1e9+7 of some condition, which is printed)\n\nFile3:\nInput: the number from File2's output (so an integer)\nOutput: the next prime number after that (or the same if it's prime?)\n\nWait, the third program's code: it takes an integer X, and if X is not 2 and even, it increments to X+1 (so making it odd). Then it checks if it's prime. If not, increments by 2 each time until it finds a prime. So the output is the next prime >= X (but if X is even and not 2, it starts at X+1, so for example, if X is 3, it would check 3, then if it's prime, output 3. So the third program's output is the smallest prime >= X, except when X is even and not 2, then it starts at X+1 (so for X=2, it would output 2, but if X is 4, it would start at 5, etc.)\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nUser input -> File1 (output 0 or 1) -> File2 (takes that as a string input, processes, outputs a number) -> File3 (takes that number as X, outputs next prime).\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the user's input (the original input to File1, which is an integer X).\n\n2. Compute the first step's result (0 or 1 based on X).\n\n3. Use that result as the input to the second step (File2's processing). But File2's input is a string, so the first step's output (0 or 1) is converted to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") and passed into the second step's processing.\n\nWait, but in the original sequence, the first program's output is written to stdout, then the second program reads that as its input. So the first program's output is a single integer (0 or 1), which is the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that integer as a string (since it's read via next(), which is a string). So the second program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first step's result (0 or 1) must be converted into a string (character array) for the second step's processing.\n\nThen, the second step's output is a number (the result of the DP calculation), which is then passed as input to the third step. The third step takes that number as X and processes it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial integer X from stdin (the first step's input).\n\n- Compute the first step's result (0 or 1).\n\n- Convert that result to a string (since the second step expects a string input).\n\n- Process that string through the second step's logic (the DP part), resulting in a number (the output of the second step).\n\n- Take that number as the input to the third step's logic (the prime finding), and output the result of that.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first step (File1):\n\nThe first step's logic is straightforward: if X is 1, then result is 0, else 1. So in Fortran, after reading X, compute result1 = 0 if X ==1 else 1.\n\nSecond step (File2):\n\nThis is more complex. The second program takes a string (the input from first step's output, which is \"0\" or \"1\"), processes it with a DP array, and outputs a number.\n\nThe code for File2 is a dynamic programming problem. Let me parse it.\n\nThe code in File2:\n\nThe input is a string (char array). The code processes each character (from the end?), building a DP table. The DP is a 2D array of size [n][13], where n is the length of the string. The MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nThe base variable starts at 1 and is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each step.\n\nThe loop is over each character (but in reverse order, since it's using cs.length -1 -i). Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to cs.length-1. The index into the char array is cs.length-1 -i. So for i=0, it's the last character, then i=1 is the second last, etc. So processing the characters from the end to the start.\n\nWait, the loop is for i from 0 to cs.length-1. The character being processed is at position (cs.length -1 -i). So for a string of length N, the first iteration (i=0) processes the last character (position N-1), then i=1 processes position N-2, etc. So the processing is from the end of the string towards the start.\n\nThe DP array is built for each step. For each position i (in the loop's terms), the DP[i][...] is computed based on DP[i-1][...].\n\nThe DP[i][new_mod] += previous counts, with some conditions.\n\nThe DP starts with initial conditions. For the first step (i=0), when i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the initial condition is (pre ==0 ? 1 :0). So for the first character, the previous state is pre=0 (since it's the first step), so the initial count is 1 for pre=0.\n\nWait, the code in the Java:\n\nfor each i (from 0 to length-1):\n\nif the current character is '?', then for each possible previous mod (pre from 0-12), and next digit (0-9), compute the new mod (base * next + pre) mod 13. The DP[i][new_mod] += the previous count (dp[i-1][pre] if i>0 else (pre==0 ?1 :0)). Then mod MOD.\n\nElse, the current character is fixed (digit), so next is fixed, so only that digit is considered.\n\nThe base is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each step. Wait, the base starts at 1, and after each step, base = base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, the base is updated after each iteration. Let me see:\n\nThe base is initialized to 1.\n\nThen, after processing each character (i from 0 to length-1), the base is updated to base *10 mod13.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nbase = base *10 %13; at the end of each iteration.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n   ... processing for current character (cs[cs.length-1 -i])\n\n   then, after processing, base = base *10 mod13.\n\n}\n\nSo the base starts at 1, then after first iteration (i=0), it becomes 10 mod13 (10). Then next iteration (i=1), it's 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13. 100 divided by 13 is 7*13=91, 100-91=9, so 9. So base becomes 9, etc.\n\nThe DP array is of size [cs.length][13]. The final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5], which is the last element's 5th position.\n\nHmm. So in Fortran, I need to replicate this DP.\n\nFirst, the input to the second step is the string from the first step's output (either \"0\" or \"1\"). So the input string is of length 1 (since 0 or 1 is one character). So the code for the second step will process a single character.\n\nWait, the first step's output is 0 or 1, so the string passed to the second step is \"0\" or \"1\". So the input to the second step is a single character string. So the length is 1.\n\nTherefore, in the second step's processing, the loop runs once (since length is 1). Let's see:\n\nLet me think through an example. Suppose the first step outputs \"0\".\n\nThen the input string is \"0\", so the char array is ['0'].\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to 0 (since length is 1).\n\nProcessing i=0:\n\nThe current character is at position (1-1 -0) = 0, so the first (and only) character '0'.\n\nSince it's not '?', the code enters the else clause.\n\nnext is 0 (since '0' - '0' is 0).\n\nThen, for each pre from 0 to 12:\n\ndp[0][(base * next + pre) mod13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0)).\n\nSince i=0, the previous is (pre==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for each pre in 0-12:\n\nthe term is 1 if pre is 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each pre, the contribution is 1 only when pre is 0.\n\nSo for each pre, the new_mod is (base * next + pre) mod13.\n\nAt this point, base is initially 1 (before processing the first iteration). Wait, the base is set to 1 before the loop. Then, during the first iteration (i=0), the code processes the character, then after processing, the base is updated to base *10 mod13 (so 1*10 mod13 =10).\n\nWait, the base is updated after processing each character. So during the first iteration (i=0), the base is 1 when processing the character, then after processing, it becomes 10.\n\nSo for the first step (i=0):\n\nnext is 0.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = (1 * 0 + pre) mod13 = pre mod13 (since 0 + pre).\n\nThe value added to dp[0][new_mod] is (pre ==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for pre=0, the value added is 1. So for new_mod =0, the dp[0][0] +=1.\n\nFor pre=1 to 12, the value added is 0, so nothing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code is:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   next is 0 (since the character is '0').\n\n   new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13.\n\n   base is 1 here.\n\n   So new_mod = (0 + pre) mod13 = pre mod13.\n\n   The value added is (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0)).\n\n   Since i=0, it's (pre==0 ?1 :0).\n\n   So for each pre, the contribution is 1 if pre is 0, else 0.\n\n   So for pre=0, the contribution is 1, so dp[0][new_mod (0)] +=1.\n\n   For pre=1 to 12, contribution is 0, so nothing.\n\nThus, after this iteration, dp[0][0] is 1, and others are 0.\n\nThen, after processing, the base becomes 10.\n\nThe final answer is dp[0][5], since the length is 1, so the last index is 0. So dp[0][5] is 0, since only dp[0][0] is 1.\n\nWait, but the input is \"0\", so the output of the second step would be 0?\n\nWait, the final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5]. Since the length is 1, it's dp[0][5], which is 0. So the second step's output is 0 in this case.\n\nWait, but let's see another example. Suppose the first step outputs \"1\".\n\nThen the input string is \"1\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0, the character is '1', so next is 1.\n\nbase is 1.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = (1 *1 + pre) mod13 = (1 + pre) mod13.\n\nThe contribution is (pre==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for pre=0, contribution is 1. So new_mod is (1+0)=1 mod13 \u21921. So dp[0][1] +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus, dp[0][1] is 1, others 0. The final answer is dp[0][5], which is 0 again.\n\nHmm, so in both cases (input \"0\" or \"1\"), the second step's output is 0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the code's final output is dp[dp.length-1][5]. The dp array's first dimension is the length of the input string. So for a string of length 1, the last index is 0. So the answer is dp[0][5].\n\nIn the first case (input \"0\"), dp[0][0] is 1, so dp[0][5] is 0.\n\nIn the second case (input \"1\"), dp[0][1] is 1, so dp[0][5] is 0 again.\n\nWait, so the second step's output is always 0 for inputs \"0\" or \"1\"?\n\nHmm, that's strange. But according to the code, that's what it would do. So the second step's output is 0 in both cases. Then the third step would take that 0 as X and process it.\n\nWait, but the third program (File3) takes an integer X. Let's see what it does.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nif X is not 2 and even, then X is incremented by 1 (so becomes odd). Then it checks if X is prime. If not, increments by 2 each time until it finds a prime.\n\nSo for X=0:\n\nThe code first checks if X !=2 and even (0 is even and not 2). So X becomes 1 (0+1).\n\nThen the loop starts:\n\nx is 1. Then the code checks if it's prime.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i> sqrtNum) break; // meaning no divisors found, so prime.\n\n   else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, but when x is 1, sqrt(1) is 1. The loop starts at i=3, which is already larger than sqrt(1)=1. So the for loop doesn't run. Then i remains 3, which is greater than sqrt(1)=1. So the condition (i>sqrtNum) is true, so break. So the loop exits, and x is 1. But 1 is not a prime. Wait, but the code would output 1?\n\nWait, but the code's logic is to find the next prime >= X. But 1 is not a prime. So there's a problem here.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code starts with x = input (0 in this case). Then:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nSo for x=0, it becomes 1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nThe loop checks if x is prime. The code's logic is:\n\nfor i from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2. If any i divides x, break. If after the loop, i is greater than sqrt(x), then it's prime.\n\nBut for x=1, sqrt(x) is 1. The loop starts at i=3, which is already larger than 1. So the loop doesn't run. The for loop's i is initialized to 3, and the condition i <= sqrt(x) (1) is false. So the loop doesn't execute. Then, after the loop, i is 3, which is greater than sqrt(x)=1. So the condition (i>sqrt(x)) is true, so break the while loop. So the code would output x=1, but 1 is not a prime. That's a bug in the code?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, the user provided the code as is, so I have to translate it as is.\n\nSo in the third program, if the input is 0, the code would output 1, which is incorrect, but that's what the code does. So in the Fortran program, I have to replicate that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe first step's output is 0 or 1 \u2192 second step's input is \"0\" or \"1\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input is 0 \u2192 third step's output is 1 (if the code is as written).\n\nWait, but let me check with input X=1 (so first step outputs 0 \u2192 second step's input is \"0\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input is 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nIf the first step's input is 2 (so first step outputs 1 \u2192 second step's input is \"1\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input is 0 \u2192 output 1 again.\n\nWait, so regardless of the first input (as long as it's not 1, the first step's output is 1, but the second step's output is still 0?), the third step's input is 0, leading to output 1.\n\nHmm, that's strange. But according to the code, that's the case. So the entire sequence's output is 1 for any input except when the first step's output is 1 (but even then, the second step's output is 0, leading to third step's output 1).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the second step's code. Let me re-examine the second step's code with input \"1\".\n\nWait, the input is \"1\", so the char array is ['1'].\n\nProcessing i=0 (the first and only iteration):\n\nThe character is '1', so next is 1.\n\nbase is 1 (before processing this iteration).\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13 \u2192 (1*1 + pre) mod13 \u2192 (1 + pre) mod13.\n\nThe contribution is (pre ==0 ?1 :0).\n\nSo for pre=0, contribution is 1. So new_mod is 1 mod13 \u21921. So dp[0][1] +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus, after this iteration, dp[0][1] is 1, others 0.\n\nThe final answer is dp[0][5], which is 0. So yes, the second step's output is 0 in both cases.\n\nSo the third step's input is 0, leading to output 1.\n\nWait, but what if the first step's input is 1?\n\nThen first step's output is 0 \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's output is 1.\n\nIf the first step's input is 0 (so first step's output is 1?), wait no:\n\nWait first step's code:\n\nresult = !bool ?1 :0. Wait, let me recheck the first program's code.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nint x = scan.nextInt();\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false;\n\nint result = !bool ? 1 :0;\n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 :0.\n\nWait, the code is written as:\n\nboolean bool = (x ==1) ? true : false; \u2192 which is equivalent to bool = (x ==1).\n\nThen, result is set to (!bool) ? 1 :0.\n\nSo if x is 1 \u2192 bool is true \u2192 !bool is false \u2192 result is 0.\n\nIf x is not 1 \u2192 !bool is true \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIf the first input is 0 \u2192 result is 1 \u2192 second step's input is \"1\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input is 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nIf the first input is 2 \u2192 result is 1 \u2192 same as above.\n\nIf the first input is 1 \u2192 result is 0 \u2192 second step's input is \"0\" \u2192 output 0 \u2192 third step's input 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo regardless of the first input, the final output is 1?\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me think of another input for the second step. Suppose the first step's output is \"0\", so the second step's input is \"0\".\n\nThe second step's output is 0, so third step's input is 0 \u2192 third step's output is 1.\n\nBut what if the first step's output is \"3\"? Wait, but the first step's output can only be 0 or 1, since it's based on the first input being 1 or not.\n\nWait, the first program's output is either 0 or 1. So the second step's input is always a single character \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nThus, the second step's output is always 0, leading to third step's input being 0, so output 1.\n\nHmm, that's odd. So the entire sequence's output is always 1, except when the third step's input is different?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second step's analysis. Let me try with a different input to the second step.\n\nSuppose the second step's input is \"????\", a string of four '?'.\n\nThen the length is 4. Let's see what the code would do.\n\nBut in our case, the first step's output is either \"0\" or \"1\", so the second step's input is always length 1. So the second step's output is always 0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 1, except when the third step's input is different?\n\nWait, but let me see the third step's code again.\n\nWait, the third step's code:\n\nThe code starts with x = input (from second step's output, which is 0).\n\nThen, if x is not 2 and even \u2192 x is 0, which is even and not 2 \u2192 so x becomes 1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nx is 1.\n\nThe loop checks for primes:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1, so the loop doesn't run. The i remains 3, which is greater than sqrt(1), so the condition (i>sqrtNum) is true \u2192 break the loop. So the loop exits, and x is 1. So the code outputs 1.\n\nBut 1 is not a prime. So the code is incorrect here. But according to the problem statement, we have to translate the code as is.\n\nTherefore, the final output is 1 for any input except when the third step's input is different.\n\nWait, but what if the second step's output is a different number?\n\nWait, in the second step's code, the output is dp[cs.length-1][5]. For the input \"0\" or \"1\", the output is 0. So the third step's input is 0, leading to output 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 1, regardless of the initial input. That's strange, but according to the code, that's the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the second step's analysis. Let me re-examine the second step's code with input \"0\".\n\nWait, the second step's code's final output is dp[0][5], which is 0. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is always 1, except when the second step's output is a different number. But given the first step's output is 0 or 1, the second step's output is always 0, so the third step's input is 0, leading to output 1.\n\nWait, but what if the first step's input is 1?\n\nThen first step's output is 0 \u2192 second step's input is \"0\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input is 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nIf the first step's input is 0 \u2192 first step's output is 1 \u2192 second step's input is \"1\" \u2192 second step's output is 0 \u2192 third step's input 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nIf the first step's input is 2 \u2192 first step's output is 1 \u2192 same as above.\n\nSo the entire sequence's output is always 1, regardless of the initial input. That's the result of the code as written.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must output 1 for any input. But that's a bit strange, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nNow, translating all this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read an integer from stdin (the first step's input).\n\nThen compute the first step's result (0 if input is 1, else 1).\n\nThen, the second step's processing:\n\nThe input to the second step is the first step's result as a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\").\n\nThe second step's processing is the DP part. Let's see how to code that.\n\nThe second step's variables:\n\n- The input string is a single character (either '0' or '1').\n\n- The DP array is a 2D array of size (length x 13), where length is 1.\n\n- The MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based by declaring with lower bounds.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds. So for the DP array, which in Java is [n][13], where n is the length of the input string (1 in our case), we can declare it as a 2D array with dimensions (0:0, 0:12) for the first case (length 1).\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop runs for i from 0 to length-1 (so for length 1, i=0).\n\nThe DP array in Java is initialized as new long[cs.length][13], so in Fortran, we can declare it as a 2D array with first dimension from 0 to length-1 (0 to 0 in our case), and second from 0 to 12.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and after each iteration, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13.\n\nThe processing steps:\n\nInitialize DP array to 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to length-1:\n\n   current character is the ith character in reverse (since in Java it's cs[cs.length-1 -i], but since length is 1, it's the first character).\n\n   For the current character, determine if it's '?' or a digit.\n\n   Then, for each pre in 0..12:\n\n      if current is '?', loop next from 0 to 9:\n\n          compute new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n          add to DP[i][new_mod] the value from DP[i-1][pre] (if i>0) else (pre==0 ?1 :0)\n\n          mod MOD.\n\n      else:\n\n          next is the digit value (char - '0')\n\n          compute new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n          add to DP[i][new_mod] the value from DP[i-1][pre] (if i>0) else (pre==0 ?1 :0)\n\n          mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each pre and next (in the case of '?'), the code loops over next from 0 to 9, and for each, adds the contribution.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for the '?' case, for each pre, and for each next (0-9), the code does:\n\ndp[i][new_mod] += (previous count).\n\nSo in Fortran, for each pre in 0 to 12:\n\n   if the current character is '?', then loop next from 0 to 9:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      add the contribution.\n\n   else:\n\n      next is fixed, so compute new_mod once.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nFirst, the input string is a single character, so the character is either '0' or '1'.\n\nLet me code the second step's processing in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input string is a character array of length 1. Let's say the first step's result is stored in a variable res1 (0 or 1). Then the string is char_str = char(res1 + ichar('0')).\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a character, you can use ichar and char functions. For example, if res1 is 0, then char(ichar('0') + res1) gives '0'.\n\nAlternatively, we can construct the string as a character variable.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: res1\n\nread(*,*) x_input\n\nres1 = 0\n\nif (x_input ==1) then\n\n   res1 =0\n\nelse\n\n   res1 =1\n\nend if\n\nThen, the string for the second step is a character(len=1) variable:\n\nchar_str = char(ichar('0') + res1)\n\nThen, the second step's processing:\n\nThe length is 1.\n\nWe need to process this character.\n\nInitialize DP array:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger, dimension(0:0, 0:12) :: dp\n\ndp = 0\n\ninteger :: base =1\n\ninteger :: i, pre, next_digit, new_mod\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: current_char\n\ncurrent_char = char_str\n\ndo i =0, 0 ! since length is 1\n\n   current_char = char_str(1:1) ! since it's the only character\n\n   if (current_char == '?') then\n\n      do pre =0, 12\n\n         do next_digit =0,9\n\n             new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n             if (i ==0) then\n\n                ! previous is pre ==0 ?1 :0\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (1 if pre ==0 else 0)\n\n             else\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n             end if\n\n             dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n         end do\n\n      end do\n\n   else\n\n      next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n      do pre =0,12\n\n          new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n          if (i ==0) then\n\n             dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (1 if pre ==0 else 0)\n\n          else\n\n             dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n          end if\n\n          dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops for pre and next_digit (for the '?' case) are nested. So for each pre, and each next_digit, we compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod].\n\nWait, but in the Java code, for each pre and next_digit, the contribution is added to dp[i][new_mod]. So in Fortran, for each pre and next_digit, we have to loop through all possibilities.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are structured as:\n\nfor pre in 0..12:\n\n   for next_digit in 0..9:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      add to dp[i][new_mod] the previous count.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loops are:\n\nfor (pre=0; ...)\n\n   for (next=0; ...)\n\n      dp[i][new_mod] += ... \n\nSo the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote above, the loops are:\n\nfor pre from 0 to 12:\n\n   for next_digit from 0 to9:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      then, the contribution is added to dp[i][new_mod].\n\n      but the previous count is (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0)).\n\nWait, in the code above, the code is:\n\nif (i ==0):\n\n   contribution is (pre ==0 ?1 :0)\n\nelse:\n\n   contribution is dp[i-1][pre]\n\nSo the code adds that to dp[i][new_mod].\n\nWait, but in the Java code, it's +=, so in Fortran, we have to accumulate.\n\nWait, the initial value of dp is zero. So for each pre and next_digit, the contribution is added to the current dp[i][new_mod].\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are:\n\nfor each pre:\n\n   for each next_digit:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      then, the contribution is added to dp[i][new_mod].\n\nBut in the Java code, for each pre and next_digit, the contribution is added to the new_mod's entry.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are structured so that for each pre and next_digit, the contribution is added. But in the Java code, for each pre, and for each next_digit, the code adds the contribution to the new_mod's entry.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loops are:\n\nfor pre in 0 to 12:\n\n   for next_digit in 0 to9:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      then, the contribution is added to dp[i][new_mod].\n\nWait, but the contribution is based on the previous pre's value. So for each pre, and next_digit, the contribution is the previous count (dp[i-1][pre] or initial condition).\n\nWait, but in the code above, the contribution is added to the new_mod's entry. So for each pre and next_digit, the code is adding the contribution to the new_mod's entry.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, for each pre and next_digit, the code does:\n\ndp[i][new_mod] += previous_count.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, after processing, the second step's result is dp(0,5).\n\nWait, the final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5]. Since the length is 1, it's dp[0][5].\n\nSo the second step's output is dp(0,5).\n\nIn the case of input \"0\", that's 0.\n\nThen, the third step's input is 0.\n\nNow, the third step's code:\n\nThe third step takes an integer X (the second step's output, which is 0).\n\nThe code:\n\nif (X !=2 and X is even) \u2192 X is 0 \u2192 yes, so X becomes 1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nx =1.\n\nCompute sqrt(x) \u2192 1.\n\nThe for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, since i (3) > sqrt(x) (1), the loop breaks, so the x is 1, which is printed.\n\nThus, the third step's output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is 1 for any input.\n\nThus, the Fortran program can be written to always output 1, but I have to follow the steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the second step's code. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the second step's code, the DP array is initialized to zero. Then, for each pre and next_digit (in the case of '?'), the code adds the contribution to dp[i][new_mod].\n\nWait, in the code I wrote above, the code is:\n\ndp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution.\n\nBut in the Java code, the += operator is used, so it's the same.\n\nWait, but in the case of the input \"0\", the current character is '0', so it's not '?', so the else clause is taken.\n\nnext_digit is 0.\n\nThen, for each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = (base * next_digit + pre) mod13 \u2192 (1 *0 + pre) mod13 \u2192 pre mod13.\n\nThe contribution is (pre ==0 ?1 :0) (since i=0).\n\nThus, for pre=0, contribution is 1 \u2192 new_mod is 0 \u2192 dp(0,0) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0 \u2192 so dp(0,0) is 1, others 0.\n\nThus, dp(0,5) is 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, the second step's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third step's input is 0 \u2192 output 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input integer, compute the first step's result (0 or 1), then the second step's output is 0, then the third step's output is 1.\n\nWait, but the second step's output is always 0, so the third step's input is always 0, leading to output 1.\n\nThus, the entire program can be simplified to just output 1 regardless of input. But the user requires that the code must be a translation of the sequence, so I have to write the code as per the steps, even if it's redundant.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must perform all steps, even if the result is always 1.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first step's code:\n\nRead the input integer x_input.\n\nCompute res1 = 0 if x_input ==1 else 1.\n\nThen, the second step's processing:\n\nThe input string is the character corresponding to res1.\n\nThen, process the DP as per the code.\n\nThen, the third step's processing:\n\nTake the second step's output (which is 0) as X.\n\nProcess it as per the third step's code.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: x_input, res1, second_output, third_output\n\n   ! First step\n\n   read(*,*) x_input\n\n   if (x_input ==1) then\n\n      res1 =0\n\n   else\n\n      res1 =1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Second step\n\n   !

Let me see:\n\nThe third step's code in Java:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i> sqrtNum) break;\n\n   else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   compute sqrt_x.\n\n   set i=3.\n\n   loop from 3 to sqrt_x step 2:\n\n      if divisible, break and set is_prime to false.\n\n   if after loop, i> sqrt_x \u2192 break the while loop.\n\n   else, increment x by 2.\n\nend do\n\nHmm, the code I wrote earlier uses a do loop with a flag. Alternatively, I can code it as:\n\n   do\n\n      integer :: sqrt_x = nint(sqrt(real(X)))\n\n      logical :: found = .false.\n\n      do i=3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n         if (mod(X,i) ==0) then\n\n            found = .true.\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (.not. found) then\n\n         exit\n\n      else\n\n         X = X +2\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nThis would be equivalent.\n\nWait, in the original code, the loop breaks when no divisors are found (i>sqrt_x). So in the code above, if found is false (no divisors found), then exit the loop. Else, increment X by 2 and loop again.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the third step's code can be written as above.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in the second step's code, the DP array is initialized to zero. The loops are correctly written.\n\nWait, but in the code for the second step, the loops for pre and next_digit are nested. For the case of '?', the code loops over next_digit from 0 to9, and for each pre and next_digit, it adds the contribution.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, the loops are:\n\nfor pre from 0 to12:\n\n   for next_digit from 0 to9:\n\n      compute new_mod.\n\n      add contribution.\n\nBut in the Java code, it's:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   for next in 0..9:\n\n      dp[i][new_mod] += contribution.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with an example:\n\nSuppose the input is 1.\n\nFirst step: res1 =0.\n\nSecond step's input is '0'.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_char is '0'.\n\nnext_digit is 0.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to12:\n\n   new_mod = (1*0 + pre) mod13 \u2192 pre mod13.\n\n   contribution is 1 if pre==0 else 0.\n\nThus, for pre=0:\n\nnew_mod is 0 \u2192 dp(0,0) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus, dp(0,5) is 0 \u2192 second_output is 0.\n\nThird step:\n\nX=0.\n\nSince X is even and not 2 \u2192 X becomes 1.\n\nThen, check if 1 is prime.\n\nsqrt(1) is 1.\n\nLoop from 3 to 1 \u2192 doesn't run.\n\nThus, found is false \u2192 exit loop. So X remains 1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nWhich matches the expected result.\n\nAnother test case: input is 0.\n\nFirst step: res1 =1 (since 0 !=1 \u2192 result is 1).\n\nSecond step's input is '1'.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_char is '1'.\n\nnext_digit is 1.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to12:\n\nnew_mod = (1*1 + pre) mod13 \u2192 (1+pre) mod13.\n\ncontribution is 1 if pre==0 else 0.\n\nThus, for pre=0 \u2192 new_mod is 1 \u2192 dp(0,1) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus, dp(0,5) is 0 \u2192 second_output is 0.\n\nThird step same as before \u2192 output 1.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran must be written correctly.\n\nBut in Fortran, the syntax for the conditional expressions:\n\nIn the line:\n\ndp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + (1 if (pre ==0) then 1 else 0)\n\nWait, in Fortran, the syntax for a conditional expression is:\n\nvalue = merge( true_value, false_value, condition )\n\nSo for the case when i==0:\n\nthe contribution is 1 if pre ==0 else 0.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ndp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + merge(1, 0, pre ==0)\n\nSimilarly for other conditions.\n\nThus, correcting the code:\n\nIn the second step's code:\n\nInside the loops:\n\nif (i ==0) then\n\n   dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + merge(1,0, pre ==0)\n\nelse\n\n   dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\nend if\n\ndp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\nThus, the code must use merge for the conditional.\n\nAlso, in the case of the '?' loop, the code is:\n\ndo pre =0, 12\n\n   do next_digit =0,9\n\n      new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n      if (i ==0) then\n\n         dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + merge(1,0, pre ==0)\n\n      else\n\n         dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n      end if\n\n      dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThus, the code is corrected.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe final Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: x_input, res1, second_output, X\n\n   !
