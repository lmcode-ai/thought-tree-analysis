Then, loop over c from A to C, and for each c, loop over d from B to D. For each (c,d), if c ==A and d ==B, skip. Else compute ans. The loops in Java are:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n    for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n        if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n        ... compute ans ...\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loops would be:\n\ndo c = A, C\n\n    do d = B, D\n\n        if (c == A .and. d == B) cycle\n\n        ... compute ans ...\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nThe ans is computed as follows:\n\nans = 0\n\nif (c > A) then\n\n    ans = ans + dp(c-1, d) * d\n\nend if\n\nif (d > B) then\n\n    ans = ans + dp(c, d-1) * c\n\nend if\n\nif (c > A .and. d > B) then\n\n    ans = ans - dp(c-1, d-1) * (c-1)*(d-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen, dp(c,d) = mod(ans + mod, mod) ?

In Fortran, we can compute this as:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans, MOD) But since ans could be negative, we need to add MOD before mod. So:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans + MOD, MOD)",

Let's see:\n\nThe loop is for each string in the array:\n\nresult +=1 (so counts the current element), then if the string is \"0\", break. So the loop stops after the first zero. So the total count is the number of elements up to and including the first zero. So for input \"5 0 3\", the count is 2 (5 and 0). For input \"0\", it's 1. For input \"1 2 3\", it's 3.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is that the first Java program reads input, the second and third process it without I/O, and the last outputs the result. So in Fortran, I have to structure it so that the first part reads the input, then passes data through variables or arrays to the next steps, and finally the last part writes the output.\n\nFirst, let me look at each Java file's purpose.\n\nStarting with File 1 (atcoder_AGC046_B.java): This seems to solve a dynamic programming problem. The input is four integers A, B, C, D. It uses a DP table to compute some value modulo 998244353, and outputs the result at dp[C][D]. The DP transitions involve combining previous states with multipliers based on current coordinates. The output is the final DP value.\n\nFile 2 (atcoder_ABC170_A.java): This counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array until a zero is encountered. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is the count until the first zero. Wait, but how does this connect to the previous program? Since the output of each Java program is the input to the next, the output of the first program (a number) must be the input to the second. But the second program expects an array of numbers. Hmm, maybe the first program's output is a single number, which is then used as input to the second program. But the second program's input is a list of numbers, so perhaps the first's output is part of that list? Or maybe the second program's input is the output of the first, followed by other numbers? Wait, the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a list of numbers. The first program's output is a single number. So the second program would take that single number as its input, but then how does it process it? Let me check the second program again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program: it reads a line, splits into tokens, counts how many until a \"0\" is found. So if the first program outputs, say, 5, then the second program's input is \"5\" followed by other numbers? Or maybe the first program's output is the entire input for the second. Wait, the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is whatever the first program printed. So if the first program outputs a single number, then the second program's input is that number as a string. But the second program expects a list of numbers. So for example, if the first program outputs \"3\", then the second program would read that as a single-element array [\"3\"], so the count would be 1 (since it's not zero). But if the first program outputs \"0\", then the count is 1 (since it stops at the first element which is zero). Wait, the code in the second program does: for each string in the input array, increments the count until a \"0\" is found. So the input is a list of numbers, and the count is the number of elements until the first zero. So the input to the second program must be a list of numbers, each as a string, separated by spaces. So the first program's output must be a line of space-separated numbers. But the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is that single number as a string. So the count would be 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1 as well (since it stops at the first element). Wait, if the first program outputs \"0\", then the second program's input is \"0\", so the count is 1 (since it breaks immediately). If the first outputs \"5 0\", then the count would be 2? But the first program only outputs one number. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is the count of numbers until the first zero. So if the first's output is 5, then the second's output is 1. If the first outputs 0, then the second's output is 1. If the first outputs 10 20 0 30, then the second's output is 3. But the first program only outputs a single number, so the second's input is a single number. So the second's output is 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1 as well. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I need to see the exact flow.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the DP value, which is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer as a string. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's code would split that into an array of one element. So the count is 1 unless the number is zero, in which case it's 1 (since it breaks after the first element). So the second program's output is 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the code for the second program:\n\nresult starts at 0. For each string in the input array, add 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", break. So for input \"5\", the loop runs once: adds 1 (result becomes 1), then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" (no), so continues. The loop ends, so the result is 1. If the input is \"0\", then the first iteration adds 1 (result is 1), then breaks. So the output is 1. If the input is \"0 5\", then the first element is \"0\", so after adding 1, it breaks, so the result is 1. So the second program's output is always 1 unless the input is empty? Wait, but the input is the output of the first program, which is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1, except when the first's output is zero, then it's 1 as well. Wait, that's strange. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the second program's purpose. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a list of numbers, but that's not the case. The first program's code ends with pw.println(dp[C][D]); so it's a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second program's output is 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1. So the second program's output is always 1? That can't be right. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a line with multiple numbers? Let me check the first program's code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's solve method: it reads A, B, C, D from input. Then computes dp[C][D], and prints that. So the output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second program's output is 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1. So the second program's output is always 1. That seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the second program's code.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is read as a line, split into an array of strings. Then for each string in the array, it increments the result by 1, then if the string is \"0\", breaks. So the count is the number of elements until (and including) the first zero. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe loop is for each string in the array:\n\nresult +=1 (so counts the current element), then if the string is \"0\", break. So the loop stops after the first zero. So the total count is the number of elements up to and including the first zero. So for input \"5 0 3\", the count is 2 (5 and 0). For input \"0\", it's 1. For input \"1 2 3\", it's 3. So the second program's output is the number of elements until the first zero (including the zero). So if the first program's output is a single number, then the second's output is 1 unless that number is zero, in which case it's 1. So the second program's output is always 1. That's strange. Maybe the first program's output is a list of numbers? Wait, no. The first program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_AGC046_B { ... }\n\nThe solve method reads A, B, C, D from the input. Then computes the DP and outputs dp[C][D]. So the output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second program's output is 1 unless the first's output is zero, then it's 1. So the second program's output is always 1. That can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is multiple numbers? Let me check again. The code has pw.println(dp[C][D]); so only one number. So the second program's input is that single number. So the second program's output is 1. So the third program's input is that 1. Let's see the third program.\n\nThird program (codeforces_622_A.java): It reads a single long (position) from input, then calculates some value based on it. The output is (position - startIndex) +1, where startIndex is determined via a loop. The code's solve function reads position via sc.nextLong(). So the third program's input is a single number. The output is the result of that calculation.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe entire sequence is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 output is a number X.\n\nSecond program takes X as input (as a single-element array), so its output is 1 (unless X is 0, then also 1). So the second's output is 1.\n\nThird program takes that 1 as input, so it reads position = 1, then computes the result based on that.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is 1. So the third program's input is \"1\", so position is 1. Then the code in the third program:\n\nThe solve function reads position as a long. Then it calculates the result based on that.\n\nSo the final output is the result of the third program's calculation with position=1.\n\nHmm, but maybe I need to make sure that the data flows correctly through the Fortran program.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, without I/O in the middle steps. So the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) reads the input (the initial A, B, C, D), computes the DP value, then passes that to the second part (second Java program's logic), which takes that DP value as input, counts the number of elements until a zero (which is 1), then passes that 1 to the third part (third Java program's logic), which computes the final result based on that 1, and outputs it.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D from input.\n\n2. Compute the DP value (as in the first Java program).\n\n3. Take that DP value, and compute the count (second Java's logic: since it's a single number, the count is 1 unless the DP is zero, then also 1. So the count is always 1? Wait, no. Wait, the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a single number. So the input array for the second program is [X], where X is the DP value. So the count is 1, because the loop runs once (adds 1 to result), then checks if the string is \"0\". So if X is 0, then the count is 1 (since it breaks after the first element). If X is non-zero, the count is 1 (since the loop runs once, and doesn't break). So the second program's output is always 1. So the third program's input is 1.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\nThe input is read as a line, split into strings. So if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", so the split gives [\"5\"], so the loop runs once. The result starts at 0, adds 1 (result=1), then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" \u2192 no, so loop ends. So the output is 1. If the first program outputs \"0\", then the split gives [\"0\"], so the loop runs once, adds 1 (result=1), then breaks. So output is 1. So yes, the second program's output is always 1. So the third program's input is 1.\n\nTherefore, the third program's input is 1. Let's see what that does.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nposition is read as a long (so 1). Then it calculates the result based on that.\n\nThe code in the third program's solve function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nThen, the code finds the nearest sequence start index (nrstSeqStartIndx) via a loop. Let's see what the code does.\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex(index) returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nThe loop starts with nrstSeqStartIndx =1. Then while getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position, multiply by 2. Then another loop to find the correct starting index.\n\nWait, let's walk through the example where position is 1.\n\nFirst, position is 1.\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx =1.\n\nCheck while getValueAtIndex(2*1) < 1? Let's compute:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1 + 1*2/2 \u2192 1+1=2. So 2 < 1? No. So the loop doesn't run. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nThen the next loop: while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position. Let's compute:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2, which is <=1? No. So the loop doesn't run. So nrstSeqStartIndx is still 1.\n\nThen startIndex = getValueAtIndex(1) \u2192 1 + 0 \u2192 1.\n\nSo the result is (1 -1) +1 =1. So the output is 1.\n\nSo the final output is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should test with another example. Let's say the first program's output is 3. Then the second program's output is 1, so the third program's input is 1, leading to output 1. Hmm, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's logic. Let me re-express the second program's code in pseudocode:\n\nInput: a line of space-separated numbers.\n\nresult =0\n\nfor each string in the split array:\n\n    result +=1\n\n    if the string is \"0\", break\n\noutput result.\n\nSo for input \"5\", the array is [\"5\"], so the loop runs once. result becomes 1. The string is not \"0\", so no break. So output is 1.\n\nFor input \"0\", the array is [\"0\"], so result becomes 1, then breaks. Output is 1.\n\nFor input \"0 5\", the array is [\"0\", \"5\"], first element: result becomes 1, then break. So output is 1.\n\nSo yes, the second program's output is always 1, unless the input is empty? But the first program's output is a single number, so the second's input can't be empty. So the second's output is always 1. So the third program's input is always 1, leading to output 1. But that's only if the first program's output is a single number. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is multiple numbers? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code: the solve method reads A, B, C, D from the input. Then it computes dp[C][D], and prints that. So the output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second's output is 1. So the third program's input is 1, leading to output 1. So the entire chain's output is 1, regardless of the first program's input, except when the first's output is zero? Wait, no, even if the first's output is zero, the second's output is 1, so the third's input is 1, so output is 1. So the final output is always 1? That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not a single number. Let me check again. The first program's code:\n\nThe solve method's last line is pw.println(dp[C][D]); so yes, it's a single number. So the second program's input is that number as a string. So the second's output is 1. So the third's input is 1, so the third's output is 1. So the entire sequence's output is 1, regardless of the input to the first program. That seems odd, but perhaps that's the case. Maybe the problem's test cases are designed such that the first program's output is a number that when passed through the second and third steps gives a different result. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's logic.\n\nLet me re-examine the third program's code. The code is for codeforces problem 622A, which is about finding the position in a sequence. The problem's description (from Codeforces 622A) is: You are given a number x. You need to find which block it is in. The blocks are defined as follows: the first block is 1, the second block is 2-3, the third is 4-6, the fourth is 7-10, etc. Each block k starts at position S(k) = 1 + k*(k-1)/2. The length of block k is k. So for example, block 1 starts at 1 (length 1), block 2 starts at 2 (length 2), block 3 starts at 4 (length 3), etc. The problem is to find the position within the block. For example, if x is 5, it's in block 3 (starts at 4, so 5-4+1=2).\n\nThe code in the third Java program is trying to find the block number and then the position within the block. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe solve function reads position as a long. Then:\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx =1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position) \u2192 this is to find the largest power of 2 where the start of the next block is less than position. So it doubles until the next block's start is too big.\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position \u2192 this adjusts to find the exact block.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first loop: while the start of the block at 2*current index is less than position, multiply by 2. This is to find a lower bound.\n\nThen, the second loop increments the index until the next block's start is beyond the position. So the correct block is at nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nThe startIndex is the start of that block. The result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo for position=1:\n\nThe first loop: check getValueAtIndex(2) = 2. Since 2 <1? No, so loop doesn't run. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nSecond loop: check getValueAtIndex(2) =2. Is 2 <=1? No. So loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValueAtIndex(1)=1. The result is (1-1)+1=1. So output is 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is 3 (so second's output is 1, third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1).\n\nIf the first program's output is 4, then second's output is 1, third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. Wait, but if the first program's output is 4, then the second's output is 1 (since it's a single number 4, so count is 1). So third's input is 1, so output is 1. Hmm, but if the first program's output is 4, then the third's input is 1, so the result is 1. But if the first program's output was 4, then the second's output is 1, so third's input is 1, so output is 1. So the entire chain's output is always 1, regardless of the first program's input? That can't be right. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single number. Let me check again. The first program's code:\n\nThe solve method reads A, B, C, D from the input. Then computes dp[C][D], and prints that. So the output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second's output is 1. So the third's input is 1, so output is 1. So the entire sequence's output is always 1, unless the first program's output is zero, but even then, the second's output is 1, leading to third's output 1. So the final output is always 1. That's strange. Maybe the problem's setup is different?\n\nWait, perhaps the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, which includes the four input numbers? No, the first program's output is only the computed DP value. The first program's input is the four numbers A,B,C,D. The first program's output is the DP value. So the second program's input is that DP value. So the second program's output is 1. So the third program's input is 1, so output is 1. So the entire sequence's output is 1, regardless of the input. That must be the case. But that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the second program's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, which includes the four input numbers? No, the first program's output is only the DP value. The first program's input is A,B,C,D, and it outputs the DP[C][D]. So the second program's input is that single number. So the second's output is 1. So the third's input is 1, so output is 1. So the final output is always 1. That's the conclusion. So the entire sequence's output is 1, unless the first program's output is zero, but even then, the second's output is 1, so third's output is 1. So the final output is always 1. That's the case.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's DP calculation. Let me think again. The first program's DP is for some problem, but the exact calculation might lead to different outputs. For example, if the input to the first program is A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1, then the DP[1][1] is initialized to 1, so the output is 1. Then the second program's output is 1, third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: Suppose the first program's output is 5. Then the second's output is 1, third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, including the four input numbers? No, the first program's output is only the DP value. The first program's input is the four numbers, but it doesn't output them. So the second program's input is only the DP value. So the second's output is 1. So the third's input is 1, so output is 1. So the entire sequence's output is always 1. That's the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the four integers A,B,C,D, compute the DP value, then pass that to the second step (which counts 1), then pass that 1 to the third step (which computes 1), and output that 1.\n\nWait, but the third step's input is the second's output, which is 1. So the third step's calculation is based on 1, leading to output 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the DP value (as per the first Java program's logic).\n\nThen, the second step's logic is to count the number of elements until a zero in the input (which is the DP value as a single element \u2192 count is 1).\n\nThen, the third step's logic is to compute the position's result based on the count (which is 1).\n\nThus, the final output is always 1, regardless of the input. But that's only if the first program's output is a single number. So the Fortran program must compute the DP value, then the rest is fixed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's logic. Let me re-express the second program's code in pseudocode:\n\nSecond program's input is a line of space-separated numbers. The code splits into an array, then counts how many elements until the first zero (including the zero). So if the first program's output is, say, 0, then the second's output is 1. If the first's output is 5, then the second's output is 1. So yes, always 1.\n\nTherefore, the third program's input is always 1, so the output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is 1, regardless of the first program's input. So the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP value (even though it's not used beyond the second step, but the second step's output is fixed), but the final output is always 1. Wait, but that can't be right. The problem says to translate the entire sequence so that the final program behaves identically. So if the original Java programs, when run in sequence, produce an output of 1 for any input, then the Fortran program must also output 1 for any input. But perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. Let me re-express the problem's instruction:\n\nThe user provided three Java programs. The first reads input, the second reads the first's output, the third reads the second's output, and the third outputs the final result. The task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first part reading input, the last part writing output, and the intermediate steps processing data without I/O.\n\nSo the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The third's output is the final output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (A,B,C,D).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (the DP value).\n\n3. Use that DP value as the input to the second program's logic (count the number of elements until zero in the input array, which is the DP value as a single element \u2192 count is 1).\n\n4. Use that count (1) as the input to the third program's logic (compute the position's result based on 1).\n\n5. Output the third program's result (which is 1).\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 1, regardless of the input. So the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP value (even though it's not used beyond the second step, but the second step's output is fixed), but the final output is always 1. Wait, but the second step's output is always 1, so the third step's input is always 1, so the third's output is always 1. So the entire program's output is 1, no matter what the input is. So the Fortran program can be written to just output 1, but that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's logic. Let me re-examine the third program's code again.\n\nThe third program's solve function reads a long 'position' from input. Then:\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx =1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position) \u2192 this loop tries to find the largest power of 2 where the next block's start is less than position.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2. So if position is 3:\n\nFirst loop: check getValueAtIndex(2*1)=2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u2192 nrstSeqStartIndx becomes 2.\n\nNow check again: getValueAtIndex(4) \u2192 1 + (4-1)*4/2 \u2192 1 + 3*2 =7. 7 <3? No. So loop stops. Now nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nThen the second loop: while getValueAtIndex(2+1)=getValueAtIndex(3)=1 + (3-1)*3/2 \u2192 1 + 3 \u21924. Is 4 <=3? No. So loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValueAtIndex(2)=2. The result is (3-2)+1=2. So output is 2.\n\nAh! So if the third program's input is 3, the output is 2. So my previous analysis was wrong. I must have made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for position=3:\n\nThe first loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) =2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nNow check again: getValueAtIndex(4) is 1 + (4-1)*4/2 \u2192 1 + 3*2 =7. 7 <3? No. So loop stops. So nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nSecond loop: while getValueAtIndex(2+1)=getValueAtIndex(3)=1 + (3-1)*3/2 \u2192 1 + 3 \u21924. 4 <=3? No. So loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValueAtIndex(2)=2. The result is (3-2)+1 =2. So output is 2.\n\nAh, so the third program's output depends on the input. So the third program's input is the second program's output, which is 1 (if the first program's output is 3), then the third's input is 1, so the output is 1. But if the first program's output is 3, then the second's output is 1 (since the input is \"3\", so count is 1), so third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1. Wait, but if the first program's output is 3, then the second's output is 1, so third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1. But if the first program's output is 4, then the second's output is 1, so third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1. But if the first program's output is 2, then the second's output is 1, so third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1. So the third program's input is always 1, so the output is always 1. Wait, but in the example where the third's input is 3, the output is 2. But in our case, the third's input is the second's output, which is always 1. So the third's input is always 1, so the output is always 1. So the final output is always 1.\n\nWait, but why in the example above when the third's input is 3, the output is 2. But in our case, the third's input is the second's output, which is always 1. So the third's input is always 1, so the output is 1. So the final output is always 1. So the entire sequence's output is 1, regardless of the first program's input. So the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP value (even though it's not used beyond the second step, but the second step's output is fixed), but the final output is always 1. So the Fortran program can be written to just output 1, but that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's logic. Let me re-express the second program's code again.\n\nSecond program's input is the first program's output, which is a single number. So the input line is, say, \"5\". The code splits into [\"5\"], then loops over each string. The result starts at 0. For the first string \"5\", adds 1 (result=1). Then checks if \"5\" is \"0\" \u2192 no. So the loop ends. The output is 1. So the second's output is 1. So the third's input is 1. So the third's output is 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 0 \u2192 second's output is 1 \u2192 third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 2 \u2192 second's output is 1 \u2192 third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a number that when passed through the second program gives a different count? For example, if the first program's output is \"0 5\", then the second's output would be 1 (since the first element is \"0\"). But the first program's output is a single number, so that can't happen. So the second's output is always 1. So the third's input is always 1, so output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final output is always 1, regardless of the first program's input. So the entire sequence's output is 1. Therefore, the Fortran program can be written to just output 1, but that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis. Wait, but the problem requires that the Fortran program must behave identically to the original chain. So if the original chain's output is always 1, then the Fortran program must also output 1 for any input. But that's only true if the second program's output is always 1. So the Fortran program can be written to just output 1, but that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's DP calculation. Let me re-express the first program's code.\n\nThe first program's DP is a 2D array of size 3001x3001. The initial condition is dp[A][B] =1. Then for each c from A to C, and d from B to D, compute the current dp[c][d] based on previous values.\n\nThe loop is for c from A to C, and for each c, d from B to D. The order is important. The code skips the initial cell (c=A, d=B). For each cell (c,d), the ans is computed as:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nIf c > A, then add dp[c-1][d] * d.\n\nIf d > B, add dp[c][d-1] * c.\n\nIf both c and d are greater than their initial values, subtract dp[c-1][d-1] * (c-1)*(d-1).\n\nThen, the dp[c][d] is ans mod MOD, adjusted to be positive.\n\nWait, the formula is a bit complex. Let me see an example.\n\nSuppose A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then the only cell is (1,1), which is initialized to 1. So the output is 1. So the second program's output is 1, third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nAnother example: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2.\n\nThe initial cell (1,1) is 1.\n\nNow, for c=1 to 2, d from 1 to 2.\n\nFirst, c=1, d=1: skipped.\n\nc=1, d=2:\n\nCheck if c>A? 1>1? No. d>B? 2>1 \u2192 yes.\n\nans starts at 0. Then add dp[1][1] * 1 (since c=1, so c is not >A, so first term not added. Second term: d> B \u2192 yes. So part is dp[1][1] (which is 1) multiplied by c (which is 1). So ans = 1*1 =1.\n\nThen, since c is not >A (since c=1 ==A), the third condition (c>A and d>B) is not met. So ans remains 1.\n\nSo dp[1][2] = 1 mod MOD \u2192 1.\n\nNext, c=2, d=1:\n\nc>A (2>1 \u2192 yes). d is 1 == B \u2192 no.\n\nans starts at 0. Add dp[1][1] * d (d is 1 \u2192 1*1=1. So ans is 1.\n\nThen, since d is not >B, no addition from the second term. The third condition (c>A and d>B) is no (d is not >B). So ans is 1. So dp[2][1] =1.\n\nNow, c=2, d=2:\n\nCheck if c>A (yes), d>B (yes).\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nFirst term: c>A \u2192 add dp[1][2] * d (d=2 \u2192 1 *2 \u2192 2.\n\nSecond term: d>B \u2192 add dp[2][1] * c (c=2 \u2192 1 *2 \u2192 2. So ans is 2+2=4.\n\nThird term: subtract dp[1][1] * (1)*(1) \u2192 1 *1 \u21921. So ans =4-1=3.\n\nSo dp[2][2] =3 mod MOD \u21923.\n\nSo the first program's output is 3. Then the second program's output is 1 (since the input is \"3\"), so third's input is 1 \u2192 output is 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is 1, so the output is 1. So even though the first program's output is 3, the final output is 1. So the entire sequence's output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must output 1 regardless of the input. But that's only true if the second program's output is always 1. So the Fortran program can be written to just read the input (A,B,C,D), compute the DP value (even though it's not used), then output 1. But the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So even if the first program's DP is 3, the second program's output is 1, so the third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the four integers, compute the DP (even though it's not used beyond the second step, but the second step's output is fixed), then output 1. But the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So the Fortran program must compute the DP value, then the second step's logic (which is to count the number of elements until zero in the input array, which is the DP value as a single element \u2192 count is 1), then the third step's logic (compute based on 1 \u2192 output 1). So the Fortran program must compute all steps, but the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the DP value (as per the first Java program's logic).\n\nThen, the second step's logic is to count the number of elements until zero in the input array (which is the DP value as a single element \u2192 count is 1).\n\nThen, the third step's logic is to compute the result based on that count (1), which is 1.\n\nThus, the final output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP value (even though it's not used beyond the second step's count), but the final output is always 1. So the code can be written to compute the DP, but the final output is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the final program behaves identically to the original chain. So if the original chain's output is always 1, then the Fortran program must also output 1 for any input. So the code can be written to just output 1, but that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis. But according to the analysis, the final output is always 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's logic. Let me re-express the second program's code again.\n\nSecond program's input is the first's output, which is a single number. So the input line is, say, \"5\". The code splits into [\"5\"], then loops over each string. The result starts at 0. For each string in the array:\n\nresult +=1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThen, if the string is \"0\", break. Since it's \"5\", no break. So the loop ends. The result is 1. So the second's output is 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is \"0\", then the array is [\"0\"], so the first iteration adds 1, then breaks. So the result is 1. So the second's output is 1.\n\nThus, the second's output is always 1. So the third's input is always 1, so the third's output is 1. So the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, compute the DP (even though it's not used), then output 1. But the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So the code must compute the DP, but the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the DP value (as per the first Java program's logic).\n\nThen, the second step's logic is to count the elements until zero (which is 1).\n\nThen, the third step's logic is to compute based on 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nThus, the code can be written to compute the DP, then output 1.\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So even if the first program's DP is 3, the second's output is 1, so the third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP, but the final output is always 1. So the code can be written to output 1 regardless of the input. But that's not correct because the first program's DP calculation might have an error in my analysis. But according to the analysis, the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the four integers A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the DP value (even though it's not used beyond the second step's count, which is always 1).\n\nThen, the third step's input is 1, so compute the result based on 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nThus, the code can be written to compute the DP, then output 1.\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So the code must compute the DP correctly, even though it's not used beyond the second step's count. But the second step's count is always 1, so the third step's input is always 1, so the third's output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the DP, then output 1.\n\nNow, to write the Fortran code:\n\nFirst, the first part (first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first program's DP is a 2D array of size 3001x3001. In Fortran, we can use a 2D array. The indices in Java are from 0 to 3000, but in the code, the initial A and B are read as integers (probably 1-based?), but the code uses A, B as starting points. The code initializes dp[A][B] =1.\n\nThe loops are for c from A to C, and for each c, d from B to D. The order is important. The code skips the initial cell (c=A, d=B).\n\nThe DP transitions are:\n\nans = 0.\n\nIf c > A: ans += dp[c-1][d] * d.\n\nIf d > B: ans += dp[c][d-1] * c.\n\nIf both c>A and d>B: ans -= dp[c-1][d-1] * (c-1)*(d-1).\n\nThen, dp[c][d] = (ans mod MOD + MOD) mod MOD.\n\nThe MOD is 998244353.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if needed. Let's see:\n\nThe Java code uses dp[A][B] =1. So if A and B are 1-based, then in Fortran, we can have a 2D array of size (3001,3001), with indices from 1 to 3000 (assuming A and B can be up to 3000). Wait, the Java code's array is declared as long[3001][3001], which in Java is 0-based, but the code uses A and B as starting points. For example, if A is 1, then the initial cell is dp[1][1].\n\nWait, in Java, the array is declared as long[3001][3001], so indices from 0 to 3000. But the code uses A and B as the starting indices. So if A is 1, then the initial cell is dp[1][1], which is within the array's bounds (since 3001 elements). So in Fortran, we can use a 2D array of size (3001,3001), with indices from 1 to 3000 (or 0 to 3000?).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds. For example, dp(0:3000, 0:3000) would be a 3001x3001 array. So the indices can be 0-based.\n\nThe first step is to read A, B, C, D. These are integers read from input.\n\nThen, initialize the DP array. We need to set dp(A,B) =1.\n\nThen, loop over c from A to C, and for each c, loop over d from B to D. For each (c,d), if c ==A and d ==B, skip. Else compute ans.\n\nThe loops in Java are:\n\nfor (int c = A; c <= C; c++) {\n\n    for (int d = B; d <= D; d++) {\n\n        if (c == A && d == B) continue;\n\n        ... compute ans ...\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loops would be:\n\ndo c = A, C\n\n    do d = B, D\n\n        if (c == A .and. d == B) cycle\n\n        ... compute ans ...\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nThe ans is computed as follows:\n\nans = 0\n\nif (c > A) then\n\n    ans = ans + dp(c-1, d) * d\n\nend if\n\nif (d > B) then\n\n    ans = ans + dp(c, d-1) * c\n\nend if\n\nif (c > A .and. d > B) then\n\n    ans = ans - dp(c-1, d-1) * (c-1)*(d-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen, dp(c,d) = mod(ans + mod, mod) ?\n\nWait, in Java:\n\ndp[c][d] = ((ans % MOD) + MOD) % MOD;\n\nThis ensures that the value is positive modulo MOD.\n\nIn Fortran, we can compute this as:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans, MOD)\n\nBut since ans could be negative, we need to add MOD before mod.\n\nSo:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans + MOD, MOD)\n\nWait, in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor. So to ensure it's positive, we can do:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans, MOD)\n\nif (dp(c,d) < 0) dp(c,d) = dp(c,d) + MOD\n\nAlternatively, compute as (ans mod MOD + MOD) mod MOD.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans + MOD, MOD)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose ans is negative. Adding MOD and then mod MOD will give the correct positive value.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndp(c,d) = mod(ans + MOD, MOD)\n\nNow, the third step's input is the second's output, which is 1. So the third step's input is 1. The third program's logic is to compute the result based on position=1.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe solve function reads position as a long (so in Fortran, an integer*8).\n\nThen:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\nloop while getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *=2\n\nthen loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx +=1\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n\n    integer*8 :: index, res\n\n    res = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\n\nend function\n\nSo in the third step's code:\n\nposition = 1\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nSo for position=1:\n\nFirst loop:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2*1) = 2. 2 <1? No \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nSecond loop:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) =2 <=1? No \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(1) =1.\n\nresult = (1-1)+1 =1.\n\nThus, the final output is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the DP array as per the first program's logic.\n\nThen, the second step's count is 1 (always).\n\nThen, compute the third step's result based on position=1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nThus, the code can be written to compute the DP, then output 1.\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire sequence's behavior is preserved. So even if the first program's DP is 3, the second's output is 1, so the third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So the final output is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to read the input, compute the DP (even though it's not used beyond the second step's count), then output 1.\n\nBut the problem requires that the code must not have any I/O in the middle steps. So the first part reads the input, the second and third steps process data without I/O, and the last part outputs the result.\n\nThus, the code structure is:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute DP.\n\nCompute second step's count (which is 1).\n\nCompute third step's result (based on count=1).\n\nOutput the third step's result (which is 1).\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: A, B, C, D\n\n    integer*8, parameter :: MOD = 998244353\n\n    integer*8 :: dp(0:3000, 0:3000)\n\n    integer*8 :: position, result\n\n    !

Second step's count is always 1\n\n    integer :: count = 1\n\n    ! Third step's input is count (1)\n\n    position = count\n\n    !

But in the code above, the count is set to 1. So the third step's input is 1, leading to result 1.\n\nThis code will output 1 regardless of the input. But according to the analysis, that's correct.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the code must behave identically to the original chain. So if the original chain's output is always 1, then this code is correct.\n\nBut let me test with the example where the first program's output is 3 (as in the earlier example where A=1,B=1,C=2,D=2). The second program's output is 1, so third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So the code outputs 1, which matches.\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 0 \u2192 second's output is 1 \u2192 third's input is 1 \u2192 output 1. So code outputs 1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
