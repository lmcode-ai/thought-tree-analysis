So in the first iteration for x=19:\n\nx/10 is 1 (since 19/10 is 1.9 \u2192 integer division gives 1). So the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. So the code adds 0 (9-9=0). Wait, but in the Java code's example with x=19: Wait, let me re-express the Java code's processing for x=19: First iteration:\n\nx =19 \u2192 r=9. Check 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes. Check if (x/10 ==0 \u2192 19/10 is 1 \u2192 no \u2192 so add 0 (9-9=0). Then x becomes 1. Second iteration:\n\nx=1 \u2192 r=1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_154_A) reads input: the first line is a string converted to a char array, then an integer K, followed by K lines each with a two-character string. It calculates a result 'res' by processing each of those K lines. The processing involves counting occurrences of the two characters from each line in the initial string, resetting counters when a different character is found, and adding the minimum of the two counts each time. Finally, it prints 'res'.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string input, then processes it in two ways: one by changing consecutive duplicates starting from the end, and another by changing from the start, counting the minimal changes needed to make all adjacent characters different. It outputs the minimum of the two counts.\n\nThe third Java file (codeforces_514_A) takes a number, breaks it into digits, and for each digit, if 9 - digit is smaller than the digit, it uses that (unless it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero, then just the digit). Then it constructs a new number from these adjusted digits and outputs it.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But since they are in sequence, the entire process must be done in Fortran without intermediate I/O except for the first read and last write.\n\nWait, but the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (the 'res' value) is the input to the second program? Wait, no, looking at the Java code:\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is the 'res' value. The second program's input is a string (from its next() function, which reads from stdin). The third program's input is a number. So the sequence is:\n\nJava1's output (res) is the input to Java2, which expects a string. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. The user says the programs are executed in sequence, with each program's output being the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but looking at the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is System.out.println(res); which is an integer.\n\nSecond program's input is a string (the x variable comes from in.next(), which is a string read from input). So the first program's output (integer) would be the input to the second program, but the second expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nWait, the first Java program's first input is a string (the first line read via readLine()), then K, then K lines each with two characters. The output is res, which is an integer. So the first program's output is an integer. The second program expects a string (the x variable is read via in.next(), which is the next token from input. So the second program's input is a string, but the first program's output is an integer. That would not align. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the programs are supposed to be run in sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the x variable is a string). So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string. Wait, looking again at the first Java code's output: it's System.out.println(res), which is an integer. So the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string (the x variable comes from in.next(), which is the next token from input). So that's a mismatch. Therefore, perhaps the problem's setup is that the first program's output is the input to the second program's first input line, but the second program's first input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are connected in a way that the first's output is the input to the second, and the second's output to the third. But the first program's output is an integer, which would be the input to the second program. The second program's input is a string (the x variable is read via in.next(), which is the next token from input). So the second program would read that integer as a string? For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read \"5\" as the input string. But then the second program's processing would be on that string. Then the second program's output is an integer (the min of a1 and a2), which is then the input to the third program. The third program expects a number (long) as input, so that's okay.\n\nWait, the third program's input is a number read via sc.nextLong(). So the second program's output (the min of a1 and a2, an integer) is the input to the third program, which reads it as a long. So the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output (integer) \u2192 second program's input (as a string, but the second program's code expects a string input, so the first's output is written as a string, which the second reads as the x variable. Then the second program processes that string (the first's output as a string) and outputs an integer. The third program reads that integer as a long and processes it.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is expecting a string input (the x variable is the input string). So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program's output is an integer. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is actually a string. Wait, looking at the first Java code again:\n\nThe first program's output is System.out.println(res); where res is an integer. So the output is an integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", which is a single-character string. Then the second program processes that string. The second program's code is designed to process a string (like \"0101\" or something), but in this case, it would process \"5\", which is a single character. The code for the second program would then process that string. Let's see:\n\nIn the second program's code, the first loop (for a1) starts at i=1, but if the string is length 1, then the loop doesn't run. So a1 would be 0. The second loop (for a2) would also not run. So the output would be 0. Then the third program would take that 0 as input, process it, and output 0. But perhaps that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string, but in the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output must be the input to the second program. So the first program's output is an integer, which is written as a string. The second program reads that as its input string. Then the second program's output is an integer, which is the input to the third program as a number.\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nInput \u2192 first program \u2192 output integer \u2192 second program (reads that integer as a string) \u2192 outputs integer \u2192 third program (reads that integer as a long) \u2192 outputs the final number.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the first program's input), process all three steps in sequence without I/O in between, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the first program's input (the initial string, K, then K lines each with two characters).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to compute res (the first program's result).\n\n3. Take that res as the input to the second program's processing. The second program's input is a string, which in this case is the string representation of res. So we need to convert the integer res into a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\n4. The second program's output is an integer (the min of a1 and a2). This becomes the input to the third program, which processes it as a number (long) and outputs the transformed number.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read all the inputs required for the first program (the initial string, K, then K lines each with two characters).\n\n- Compute the first program's result (res).\n\n- Convert res to a string, then process it through the second program's logic (the string processing part).\n\n- Take the result from the second program (the min of a1 and a2), then process that as the input to the third program's logic (the number processing part).\n\n- Finally, output the result of the third program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the first input line (the initial string). Let's say it's a character array.\n\n2. Read K as an integer.\n\n3. Read K lines, each consisting of two characters. Store these as a list of two-character strings.\n\n4. Compute res as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n   The first program's logic:\n\n   For each of the K lines (each with two characters):\n\n   Initialize a and b to 0.\n\n   Iterate over each character in the initial string (arr):\n\n   If the current character is the first character of the current input line, increment a.\n\n   Else if it's the second character, increment b.\n\n   Else:\n\n      add min(a, b) to res.\n\n      reset a and b to 0.\n\n   After the loop over the initial string's characters, add min(a, b) to res.\n\n   So for each of the K lines, process the initial string and accumulate res.\n\n5. Once res is computed, convert it to a string (since that's the input to the second program).\n\n6. Process this string through the second program's logic.\n\n   The second program's logic:\n\n   Take the input string (the res string from first program).\n\n   Create two copies (a and b as strings).\n\n   For a:\n\n   Iterate from the second character to the end:\n\n      if current character is same as previous, change it to the opposite (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\n   For b:\n\n   Iterate from the end backwards to the first character:\n\n      if current character is same as previous, change the previous to opposite, increment a2.\n\n   The result is min(a1, a2).\n\n   Wait, the second program's code:\n\n   For the first loop (a1):\n\n   For i from 1 to length-1 (since starting at 1, up to x.length-1? Wait in Java, the loop is for (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++), so in Fortran indices start at 1, so similar.\n\n   So for each i from 2 to len (assuming 1-based):\n\n   if a's current char (i) is same as previous (i-1):\n\n      flip it, increment a1.\n\n   Wait, the code in Java for a's processing:\n\n   for (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n       if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n           if (a.charAt(i) == '1') set to '0', else '1'\n\n           a1++;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   So the first character is left as is, and for each subsequent character, if it's same as previous, flip it and count.\n\n   For the second loop (a2):\n\n   for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--):\n\n       if (b's char at i == char at i-1):\n\n           flip the previous (i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\n   So in this case, when moving backward, they flip the previous character (i-1) instead of the current.\n\n   So for the second processing (b):\n\n   Starting from the end, check if current and previous are same. If so, flip the previous (i-1) and count.\n\n   So the processing for a and b are different.\n\n   So in Fortran, need to handle these loops.\n\n   The input string here is the string representation of res (from first program). Let's call this string_str.\n\n   So first, convert res to a string (string_str).\n\n   Then process this string_str through the second program's logic.\n\n   The result is min(a1, a2).\n\n7. Take that result (integer) and process it through the third program's logic.\n\n   The third program's logic:\n\n   Take the number (the min from second program's output), break into digits, for each digit, choose the smaller between digit and 9-digit (unless it's the last digit and 9-digit is zero, then keep digit).\n\n   Then construct a new number from these digits.\n\n   So steps:\n\n   - Convert the integer (let's call it num) to a list of digits.\n\n   - For each digit, compute the minimal between digit and 9-digit. But with the exception: if it's the last digit (the original's least significant digit) and 9-digit is zero, then keep the digit.\n\n   Wait, the third Java code's logic:\n\n   The code reads x as a long, then while x>0, it takes the remainder mod 10 (r = x%10), then checks if 9 - r is less than r. If so, then if (x/10 ==0 (meaning it's the last digit) and 9 - r ==0, then add r to the list, else add 9-r. Else add r.\n\n   Wait, the code:\n\n   while (x >0) {\n\n       r = x%10;\n\n       if (9 - r < r) {\n\n           if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n           else list.add(9 - r);\n\n       } else list.add(r);\n\n       x = x/10;\n\n   }\n\n   So the digits are processed from least significant to most (since mod 10 gives the last digit first). The list is built in reverse order (since we process from the end). Then when reconstructing the new number, the list is traversed from first to last (which is the original's most to least digits?), but the code loops over the list and builds the number as newNumber += digit * 10^pow, so the first element in the list (the first digit processed, which is the original's last digit) is the least significant digit in the new number.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n   For each digit (starting from the end of the original number):\n\n       if 9 - digit is less than digit:\n\n           if it's the last digit (original's first digit in processing, since x/10 ==0 when x was the original digit):\n\n               and 9 - digit is zero (so digit is 9?), then keep digit.\n\n               else, use 9 - digit.\n\n           else use 9 - digit.\n\n       else use digit.\n\n   Then the digits are arranged in the same order as they were processed (so reversed from the original's digit order), but when building the new number, each digit is multiplied by 10^power, so the first digit in the list (the original's last digit) becomes the least significant digit of the new number.\n\n   So the third program's processing is to take the number (the second program's output), break into digits, process each digit as per the condition, then reconstruct the number.\n\n   So in Fortran, need to take the integer (from second program's output), process each digit, then build the new number.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first input (the initial string, K, then K lines each with two characters).\n\n- Compute res as per first program.\n\n- Convert res to a string, then process through second program's logic to get min_val.\n\n- Take min_val as the input to third program's processing, get the final number.\n\n- Output that final number.\n\nNow, let's think about the variables and steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (first Java program):\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- The initial string (as a character array). Let's say it's a character array of length N.\n\n- K as an integer.\n\n- The K lines each with two characters. So an array of K elements, each being a 2-character string.\n\nProcessing for res:\n\nInitialize res =0.\n\nLoop over each of the K lines:\n\n   For each line (two characters, say c1 and c2):\n\n      Initialize a=0, b=0.\n\n      Loop over each character in the initial string:\n\n          if current_char == c1: a +=1\n\n          else if current_char == c2: b +=1\n\n          else:\n\n              res += min(a, b)\n\n              a =0; b=0\n\n      After the loop over the initial string's characters, add min(a,b) to res.\n\nSo in Fortran, the initial string can be read as a character array. The K lines can be read as a 2D array of characters (K rows, 2 columns).\n\nNow, the second part (second Java program):\n\nThe input string is the string representation of res. Let's call this str2.\n\nWe need to process this string through the second program's logic.\n\nFirst, create two copies of the string (a and b).\n\nProcessing a:\n\nLoop from i=2 to len(str2):\n\n   if a(i) == a(i-1):\n\n       flip the character (0 <->1)\n\n       increment a1.\n\nProcessing b:\n\nLoop from i = len(str2) down to 2:\n\n   if b(i) == b(i-1):\n\n       flip the (i-1)th character.\n\n       increment a2.\n\nThen the result is min(a1, a2).\n\nWait, in the second program's code for b:\n\nThe loop is for (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--):\n\n   if (b's char at i == char at i-1):\n\n       flip the previous (i-1) to opposite.\n\n       a2++;\n\nSo in Fortran, for the b processing:\n\nLoop i from len(str2) downto 2:\n\n   if (b(i) == b(i-1)) then\n\n       if (b(i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b(i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b(i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nSo the processing for a and b is different.\n\nThird part (third Java program):\n\nTake the min_val (the result from second program) as the input number.\n\nProcess each digit:\n\n   Convert the number to a list of digits (digits array).\n\n   For each digit (starting from the least significant digit first, as in the Java code):\n\n       r = mod(number, 10)\n\n       number = number /10\n\n       process r as per the condition.\n\n       add to a list.\n\n   Then, reconstruct the new number from the list.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits are processed from the end (mod 10 gives the last digit first). So the digits are stored in the list in reverse order (from least to most significant). Then when building the new number, each digit is multiplied by 10^power, so the first element in the list (the original's last digit) is the least significant digit of the new number.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can store the digits in an array, then process them, then build the new number.\n\nAlternatively, process the digits as we go.\n\nLet me think of steps for the third part:\n\nTake the min_val (integer) as the input.\n\nInitialize newNumber =0, pow=0.\n\nWhile min_val >0:\n\n   r = mod(min_val,10)\n\n   min_val = min_val /10\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n       if ( (min_val ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n           digit = r\n\n       else\n\n           digit = 9 - r\n\n       end if\n\n   else\n\n       digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digit * 10**pow\n\n   pow = pow +1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after dividing by 10, the next iteration processes the next digit. So the digits are processed in reverse order (from least to most). The newNumber is built by adding digit * 10^pow each time. So the first digit (r from mod(10)) is the least significant digit (pow starts at 0, so 10^0 is 1, so digit is added as the units place). The next digit is multiplied by 10^1, etc.\n\nSo the code above would work.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read the initial string, K, then K lines each with two characters.\n\nIn Fortran, reading lines can be done with read(*,*) but for strings, perhaps using list-directed input may not be sufficient. Alternatively, using read(*,'(A)') to read the entire line.\n\nBut in the first Java program, the first line is read as a string (the initial string). So in Fortran:\n\nRead the first line as a character array. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: initial_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') initial_str\n\nThen, read K as an integer:\n\ninteger :: K\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nThen read K lines, each with two characters. Let's store them in a 2D array:\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: inputs(K)\n\ndo i =1, K\n\n   read(*,'(A)') inputs(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the read statement may need to read exactly two characters. Alternatively, read the entire line and take the first two characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a string of length 2:\n\ndo i=1, K\n\n   read(*, '(A2)') inputs(i)\n\nend do\n\nBut need to ensure that each line has exactly two characters. Assuming the input is correct.\n\nNow, compute res:\n\nInitialize res =0\n\nloop over each of the K inputs:\n\n   c1 = inputs(i)(1:1)\n\n   c2 = inputs(i)(2:2)\n\n   a =0\n\n   b=0\n\n   do j=1, len_trim(initial_str)\n\n       current_char = initial_str(j:j)\n\n       if (current_char == c1) then\n\n           a = a +1\n\n       else if (current_char == c2) then\n\n           b = b +1\n\n       else\n\n           res = res + min(a, b)\n\n           a =0\n\n           b=0\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   res = res + min(a, b)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the min function for integers is min(a,b). So that's okay.\n\nNow, after computing res, we need to convert it to a string for the second program's processing.\n\nConvert res to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str2\n\nwrite(str2, '(I0)') res\n\nstr2 = adjustl(str2)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nNow, process this string through the second program's logic.\n\nFirst, process a and b.\n\nInitialize a1 and a2 to 0.\n\nFirst, process a:\n\ncharacter(len=len_trim(str2)) :: a_str = str2\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i=2, len_trim(a_str)\n\n   if (a_str(i:i) == a_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a_str(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a_str(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a_str(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen process b:\n\ncharacter(len=len_trim(str2)) :: b_str = str2\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(b_str), 2, -1\n\n   if (b_str(i:i) == b_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (b_str(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b_str(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b_str(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThe result is min(a1, a2).\n\nmin_val = min(a1, a2)\n\nNow, process min_val through the third program's logic.\n\nCompute the new number.\n\ninteger :: min_val, newNumber=0, pow=0, temp_val=min_val\n\nnewNumber =0\n\npow=0\n\ntemp_val = min_val\n\ndo while (temp_val >0)\n\n   r = mod(temp_val,10)\n\n   temp_val = temp_val /10\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n       if ( (temp_val ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n           digit = r\n\n       else\n\n           digit = 9 - r\n\n       end if\n\n   else\n\n       digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digit * 10**pow\n\n   pow = pow +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is **. So 10**pow is okay.\n\nWait, but in the case where temp_val is zero after division, but the digit is 9, then 9 - r would be 0, so the condition (temp_val ==0 and 9 - r ==0) would be true, so digit is r (9). So that's correct.\n\nFinally, output newNumber.\n\nprint *, newNumber\n\nPutting all together in code.\n\nNow, handling the string lengths and possible issues.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The initial_str may have leading or trailing spaces if read with a fixed length. Using len_trim to get the actual length.\n\n- The second program's processing requires the string to be at least length 1. If res is 0, then str2 is \"0\", so the loops for a and b would not run (since len_trim is 1, so i starts at 2 which is beyond the length. So a1 and a2 remain 0, min is 0.\n\n- The third program's processing of min_val (which could be zero) is okay.\n\nNow, writing the Fortran code step by step.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=1000) :: initial_str\n    integer :: K\n    character(len=2), dimension(:), allocatable :: inputs\n    integer :: res, i, j, a, b, c1, c2, len_initial, a1, a2, min_val, newNumber, pow, temp_val, r, digit\n    character(len=20) :: str2\n    character(len=20) :: a_str, b_str\n\n    !

Output the final result\n    print *, newNumber\n\n    deallocate(inputs)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's processing, the variables a_str and b_str need to be of length equal to the string. Since str2 is up to 20 characters, but len_trim(str2) gives the actual length. So in the code above, a_str and b_str are declared as len=20, which is okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the variables a_str and b_str are declared as len=20, but when assigned str2 (which is 20 characters), but with adjustl, the actual content is the trimmed string. The loops for i=2 to len_str2 (the length of the trimmed string) should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when comparing characters, using ichar to get their ASCII codes. The original Java code compares characters directly. So in Fortran, comparing the characters directly (as characters) is better than converting to ASCII codes. Because in Java, the comparison is done on the characters themselves, not their integer values. So in the code above, the current_char is a character, and the inputs are characters. So perhaps the code can be adjusted to compare characters directly.\n\nLet me adjust that part:\n\nIn the first loop (processing each input line):\n\nInstead of converting to ASCII codes, compare the characters directly.\n\nSo:\n\n    do i=1, K\n        ! Get the two characters from current input\n        character(len=1) :: c1_char = inputs(i)(1:1)\n        character(len=1) :: c2_char = inputs(i)(2:2)\n\n        a =0\n        b =0\n\n        do j=1, len_initial\n            character(len=1) :: current_char = initial_str(j:j)\n\n            if (current_char == c1_char) then\n                a = a +1\n            else if (current_char == c2_char) then\n                b = b +1\n            else\n                res = res + min(a, b)\n                a =0\n                b =0\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        res = res + min(a, b)\n    end do\n\nThis is better, avoiding the ichar calls.\n\nSo the corrected code for that part.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the third part, when temp_val is zero, the loop exits. So if min_val is zero, then temp_val starts as zero, so the loop doesn't run, and newNumber remains zero. Which is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's res is 0. Then the second program's input is \"0\", which is length 1. So a1 and a2 are 0. min_val is 0. The third program processes 0, which mod 10 gives 0, then temp_val becomes 0. The loop runs once (since temp_val was 0 initially? Wait, no:\n\nWait, temp_val is initialized to min_val (0). The loop condition is while temp_val >0. So the loop doesn't run. So newNumber remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's res is 5. The second program's input is \"5\". The string is length 1, so a1 and a2 are 0. min_val is 0. Third program processes 0 \u2192 newNumber is 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's res is 11. The string is \"11\". Processing a:\n\nLoop i=2 (since len is 2):\n\na_str starts as \"11\".\n\nAt i=2, a_str(2) is '1', same as previous '1'. So flip to '0', a1 becomes 1. So a_str becomes \"10\".\n\nProcessing b:\n\nStart with \"11\".\n\nLoop i=2 down to 2:\n\nCheck i=2. b_str(2) and (1) are both '1'. So flip the previous (i-1=1) to '0', so b_str becomes \"01\", a2 becomes 1.\n\nThus min(a1,a2) is 1. So min_val is 1.\n\nThird program processes 1:\n\ntemp_val =1.\n\nLoop:\n\nr =1 mod10 \u21921. temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1=8 <1? No. So digit is 1.\n\nnewNumber =1 *10^0 \u21921.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case for third program:\n\nSuppose min_val is 9.\n\nProcessing:\n\ntemp_val=9 \u2192 r=9 mod10 \u21929. temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if temp_val (0) ==0 and 9-9 (0) ==0 \u2192 yes. So digit is 9.\n\nnewNumber =9 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: min_val= 19.\n\nDigits are 1 and 9.\n\nProcessing 19:\n\nFirst iteration (temp_val=19):\n\nr=9 \u2192 temp_val becomes 1.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. But temp_val (1) is not zero. So digit is 0 (9-9=0). So digit is 0.\n\nSecond iteration (temp_val=1):\n\nr=1 \u2192 temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1=8 <1? No. So digit is 1.\n\nnewNumber =0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u219210.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nWait, the digits are processed as follows:\n\nOriginal number is 19 \u2192 digits are 1 (tens place) and 9 (units).\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst iteration (temp_val=19):\n\nr =19 mod10 \u21929 \u2192 temp_val becomes 19/10=1.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if temp_val (1) is zero? No \u2192 so digit is 0 (9-9=0).\n\nSecond iteration (temp_val=1):\n\nr=1 mod10 \u21921 \u2192 temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So digit is 1.\n\nSo newNumber is 0 (from first digit) *10^0 + 1 (second digit) *10^1 \u2192 10 +0 \u219210?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the first digit (r=9) is the units place (since it's the first mod). So the first digit (9) is processed first, and the digit chosen is 0 (since 9-9=0 <9, and temp_val (after division is 1, not zero). So the first digit (units) is 0. The second digit (1) is processed next, which is 1. So the new number is 1*10^1 +0*10^0 \u219210.\n\nBut according to the third Java code's logic:\n\nThe original number is 19.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx starts as 19.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nr =19%10 \u21929 \u2192x becomes 1.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if x/10 (1/10 is 0.1 \u2192 integer division gives 0. So x/10 is 0 (since 1//10 is 0 in integer division).\n\nSo temp_val after division is 0 (since 1//10 is 0).\n\nSo the condition (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0 \u2192 yes (since 9-9=0). So digit is r (9).\n\nWait, this is conflicting with the previous analysis.\n\nWait, in the third program's code:\n\nThe code for the first digit (r=9):\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen check if (x/10 ==0) \u2192 after division, x becomes 1//10 \u21920 (since in Java, integer division of 1/10 is 0).\n\nWait, original x is 19 \u2192 first iteration:\n\nx =19 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 x becomes 19//10 \u21921.\n\nThen, in the condition:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 \u2192 1/10 is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nand (9 -r ==0 \u2192 yes (0 ==0).\n\nSo the condition is true \u2192 add r (9) to the list.\n\nThus the digit is 9.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nx is now 1 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 x becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 so add 1.\n\nThus the list has [9,1].\n\nThen the new number is 9*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 9 +10 \u219219.\n\nWait, but according to the code's logic, the new number would be 19?\n\nWait, but according to the code's processing:\n\nThe list is built as follows:\n\nFirst iteration (r=9):\n\nsince 9-9 is 0 <9, and x/10 (after division is 1//10=0 \u2192 yes, so add 9.\n\nSecond iteration (r=1):\n\n9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 add 1.\n\nThe list is [9,1].\n\nThen newNumber is 9*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 9 +10 =19.\n\nWait, so the third program's output would be 19 for input 19?\n\nBut according to the code's logic, the third program's processing for 19 would return 19?\n\nHmm, but according to the code's condition, for the first digit (9):\n\nThe code says:\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 yes (0 <9).\n\nthen check if (x/10 ==0 (after division, x is 1 \u2192 x/10 is 0.1 \u2192 integer division gives 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nand 9 -r ==0 \u2192 yes (0 ==0).\n\nso add r (9).\n\nThus the digit is 9.\n\nSo the new number is 19.\n\nBut according to the Fortran code I wrote earlier, when processing 19:\n\nFirst iteration (temp_val=19):\n\nr=9 \u2192 temp_val becomes 1.\n\nCheck 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck (temp_val (1) ==0? No \u2192 so digit is 0 (9-9=0).\n\nSecond iteration (temp_val=1):\n\nr=1 \u2192 temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 digit is 1.\n\nThus newNumber is 0 +1*10 \u219210.\n\nWhich is different from the correct result of 19.\n\nAh, here's a mistake in the Fortran code.\n\nThe problem is in the condition for the third program's processing.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nif ( (temp_val ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\ndigit = r\n\nelse\n\ndigit =9 -r\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the condition is:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, after processing the digit r, temp_val is set to temp_val /10. So when processing the first digit (r=9):\n\ntemp_val was 19 \u2192 after mod and division, temp_val becomes 1 (19//10=1).\n\nSo in the condition:\n\ntemp_val (after division) is 1, not zero. So the condition (temp_val ==0) is false. So the code chooses digit =9 -r (0).\n\nBut in the Java code, the condition is based on the original x before division. Wait, in the Java code:\n\nThe code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r.\n\n    else add 9 -r.\n\n}\n\nBut in the Java code, the x/10 is the value before dividing by 10. Because x is divided after.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nx is the original value before mod and division.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nr = x%10;\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n    if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r.\n\n    else add 9 -r.\n\n}\n\nx = x/10;\n\nSo the condition uses x/10 before division. So in the first iteration for x=19:\n\nx/10 is 1 (since 19/10 is 1.9 \u2192 integer division gives 1).\n\nSo the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. So the code adds 0 (9-9=0).\n\nWait, but in the Java code's example with x=19:\n\nWait, let me re-express the Java code's processing for x=19:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx =19 \u2192 r=9.\n\nCheck 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if (x/10 ==0 \u2192 19/10 is 1 \u2192 no \u2192 so add 0 (9-9=0).\n\nThen x becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nx=1 \u2192 r=1.\n\nCheck 9-1 <1 \u2192 8 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 add 1.\n\nThus the list is [0,1], so the new number is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u219210.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my previous analysis. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the Java code's condition for the first digit (r=9):\n\nThe code says:\n\nif (x/10 ==0 \u2192 19/10 is 1 \u2192 no \u2192 so the condition is false. So the code adds 9 -r (0).\n\nThus the first digit is 0, second is 1 \u2192 new number is 10.\n\nAh, so my previous analysis was wrong. The correct result for input 19 is 10.\n\nSo the Fortran code's calculation is correct, and my earlier analysis was wrong.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nAnother test case: input 9.\n\nProcessing:\n\ntemp_val=9 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-9 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck (temp_val (0) ==0 and 9-9 ==0 \u2192 yes \u2192 so digit is 9.\n\nnewNumber is 9 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: input 10.\n\nProcessing:\n\ntemp_val=10 \u2192 first iteration:\n\nr=0 \u2192 temp_val becomes 1.\n\nCheck 9-0=9 <0 \u2192 no \u2192 so digit is 0.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nr=1 \u2192 temp_val becomes 0.\n\nCheck 9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 digit is 1.\n\nnewNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u219210.\n\nBut according to the code's logic:\n\nx=10 \u2192 first iteration:\n\nr=0 \u2192 9-0=9 <0 \u2192 no \u2192 add 0.\n\nx becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nr=1 \u2192 9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no \u2192 add 1.\n\nnewNumber is 0*10 +1 \u219210 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be correct."
