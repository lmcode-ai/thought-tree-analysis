    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The key is to make sure that the output of each Java program is passed as input to the next, but in Fortran, I can't have separate files. So I have to combine them into one, handling the data flow internally.\n\nFirst, let me understand each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nStarting with File 1 (atcoder_ABC123_B.java):\n\nThis program reads 5 integers, calculates some values, and outputs a sum. The steps are:\n\n- Read 5 numbers into array a.\n- Compute r[i] = a[i] mod 10.\n- For each a[i], if r[i] is not 0, compute b = 10 - r[i], and store in a TreeMap with key b and value a[i].\n- If the TreeMap is empty (all a[i] end with 0), sum all a[i] and print.\n- Else, find the entry with the largest b (since TreeMap is sorted, lastKey gives the largest). The value of this entry is 'last', and find its index in the original array.\n- Then, for all elements except the one at 'last's index, add to ans:\n   - If the element mod 10 is 0, add the element as is.\n   - Else, add the element plus (10 - r[i]).\n- Add the 'last' element to ans, then print.\n\nThe output of this is the ans value, which will be the input for the next program.\n\nWait, but the next program (File 2) expects input from the user. Wait, no, the second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C) starts by reading N via gi(). But in the original setup, the first program's output is the input for the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. But in the original Java setup, each program is run in sequence, so the first's output is piped into the second's input, and the second's output into the third's input, and finally the third's output is the final result.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's input is read from stdin, then the first's output is passed to the second's input, then the second's output to the third's input, and the third's output is printed. But in Fortran, I can't have intermediate I/O. So all the data must be passed in memory.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (the 5 integers) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans) and store it as a variable.\n\n3. Use that ans as the input for the second Java program's N variable. Wait, but the second Java program's first line is N = gi(), which reads an integer. So the first program's output (the ans) is the N for the second program?\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C):\n\nThe second program starts by reading N via gi(). So the first program's output (the ans) must be the N for the second program. Then the second program's output is some count (c), which is then used as input for the third program?\n\nWait, the third program (codeforces_678_B) starts by reading an integer y via in.nextInt(). So the second program's output (the printed c) must be the y for the third program. Then the third program's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nJava1's input (5 numbers) \u2192 Java1's output (ans) \u2192 Java2's input (N) \u2192 Java2's output (c) \u2192 Java3's input (y) \u2192 Java3's output (the desired final result).\n\nSo in the Fortran program, I need to:\n\n- Read the 5 integers from stdin (first block's input).\n\n- Compute the first program's ans.\n\n- Use that ans as the N for the second program's processing.\n\n- Compute the second program's c.\n\n- Use that c as the y for the third program's processing.\n\n- Compute the third program's output and print it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the 5 integers (a1 to a5) from stdin.\n\n2. Process them as per the first Java program to get ans.\n\n3. Then, process ans as N in the second Java program's logic to get c.\n\n4. Then, process c as y in the third Java program's logic to get the final output.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst Program (Java1):\n\nVariables:\n\na is an array of 5 integers.\n\nr is an array of 5 integers (r[i] = a[i] mod 10).\n\nThe TreeMap is used to store (b, a[i]) where b = 10 - r[i] if r[i] !=0.\n\nThe TreeMap is sorted by key, so the last key is the maximum b. The corresponding a[i] is the 'last' variable.\n\nIn Fortran, since we can't use a TreeMap, we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i] manually.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\na(5) as integers.\n\nr(5) as integers.\n\nmax_b = -1\n\nlast_val = 0\n\nindex_of_last = 0\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 5 (Fortran arrays start at 1? Or 0? Wait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless specified. So need to be careful.)\n\nWait, in Java, the arrays are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based, but adjust indices accordingly.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++), so indices 0-4.\n\nIn Fortran, let's use 1-based arrays. So a(1) to a(5).\n\nSo:\n\nRead the 5 integers into a(1) to a(5).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 5:\n\nr(i) = mod(a(i),10)\n\nif r(i) /=0 then:\n\n   b = 10 - r(i)\n\n   if (b > max_b) then\n\n       max_b = b\n\n       last_val = a(i)\n\n       index_of_last = i\n\n   else if (b == max_b) then\n\n       ! Need to check if there are multiple entries with same b. Since TreeMap's lastKey is the largest, but if multiple entries with same key, the TreeMap would have only one entry (since keys are unique). Wait, in Java's TreeMap, if you put the same key again, it overwrites. So in the code, for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then b is 10 - r[i], and map.put(b, a[i]). So if two a's have the same b, the later one will overwrite the previous. So the last a[i] with that b will be stored.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for each a[i], so for each i, if r[i] !=0, then the b is computed and stored in the TreeMap. So if two a's have the same b, the later one (higher i) will overwrite the previous entry. So the TreeMap's lastKey is the maximum b, and the value is the a[i] with the largest b, and if there are multiple with same b, the last one (highest i) is stored.\n\nWait, but the TreeMap is sorted by key, so the lastKey is the maximum key. The value stored for that key is the last a[i] that had that b.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i], we can track:\n\nmax_b, last_val, and index_of_last.\n\nInitialize max_b to -1 (since b can be up to 9, but if all r[i] are 0, then the TreeMap is empty).\n\nLoop over each a(i):\n\nr(i) = mod(a(i),10)\n\nif r(i) /=0 then:\n\n   b = 10 - r(i)\n\n   if (b > max_b) then\n\n       max_b = b\n\n       last_val = a(i)\n\n       index_of_last = i\n\n   else if (b == max_b) then\n\n       ! if current a(i) is later (i is higher), then update last_val and index_of_last.\n\n       if (i > index_of_last) then\n\n           last_val = a(i)\n\n           index_of_last = i\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nSo that way, for same b's, the latest (highest i) a[i] is stored.\n\nOnce all a's are processed:\n\nif max_b == -1 (i.e., all r[i] were 0), then ans is sum of all a's.\n\nElse:\n\nans is computed as follows:\n\nsum all a's except the one at index_of_last, but with some adjustments.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n\n    if (i != idx) {\n\n        if (a[i] %10 ==0 then add a[i]\n\n        else add a[i] + (10 - r[i])\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nthen add last (the last_val) to ans.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nThen, for all elements except the one at idx (the index of last_val), they are added with:\n\nif a[i] mod10 is 0 \u2192 add a[i]\n\nelse add a[i] + (10 - r[i])\n\nThen add last_val.\n\nWait, but r[i] is a[i] mod10. So for a[i] mod10 ==0, then r[i] is 0, so 10 - r[i] is 10, but in the code, when r[i] is 0, the code skips adding the 10 - r[i] part. So the code for the non-last elements:\n\nif a[i] mod10 is 0 \u2192 add a[i]\n\nelse \u2192 add a[i] + (10 - r[i])\n\nWait, but 10 - r[i] is the b value. So for a[i] not ending with 0, the code adds the next multiple of 10. For example, if a[i] is 23, r[i] is 3, so 10-3=7, so 23 +7 =30. So the code is rounding up to the next multiple of 10, except for the last element (the one with the maximum b) which is added as is.\n\nWait, but the last element is the one with the maximum b. So the code is adding all other elements rounded up to the next multiple of 10 (except those already multiples of 10, which are added as is), and the last element is added as is.\n\nWait, but the last element's r[i] is not zero (since it was part of the TreeMap). So its r[i] is non-zero, so when added, it would have been rounded up. But in the code, it's added as is. So the last element is not rounded up.\n\nWait, the code for the last element is added as last_val (the a[i] at index_of_last). So the code is:\n\nans += last_val.\n\nSo the total ans is sum of (all other elements rounded up to next 10, except those already multiples of 10) plus the last element as is.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nCompute the sum as follows:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1 to 5\n\n   if (i == index_of_last) then\n\n       continue\n\n   else\n\n       if (mod(a(i),10) ==0) then\n\n           ans = ans + a(i)\n\n       else\n\n           ans = ans + a(i) + (10 - mod(a(i),10))\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nans = ans + last_val\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C):\n\nThe second program's input is N (the first program's output ans). The program counts the number of integers up to N that contain at least one 3, 5, and 7 in their digits, and also follows some generation logic with a loop.\n\nWait, the code for the second program is a bit more complex. Let me parse it.\n\nThe second program's main steps:\n\nRead N via gi().\n\nInitialize i to 357.\n\nc is the count.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   Convert i to a string s.\n\n   Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7' \u2192 if yes, increment c.\n\n   Then, generate the next i via some transformation.\n\nThe transformation part is a bit tricky.\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder to process the digits of i in reverse, then builds the next number.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n\nboolean f = false;\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\n    char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j); // processing from the end, so first character is the last digit.\n\n    if (f) {\n\n        sb.append(a);\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a == '3') {\n\n            sb.append('5');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else if (a == '5') {\n\n            sb.append('7');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            sb.append('3');\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nThen, reverse the sb and parse as the next i.\n\nWait, let me walk through an example.\n\nSuppose i is 357 (the starting value).\n\ns is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (so first character is '7', then '5', then '3').\n\nWait, the loop is for j from 0 to s.length()-1 (since j starts at 0 and goes up to s.length()-1). The first iteration (j=0):\n\na = s.charAt(s.length() -1 -0) \u2192 s.length() is 3, so 3-1-0=2 \u2192 s[2] is '7'.\n\nThen, since f is initially false:\n\nCheck a == '3'? No. '5'? No. So append '3' to sb. f remains false.\n\nNext j=1:\n\na is s[3-1-1] = s[1] \u2192 '5'.\n\nAgain, f is false.\n\nCheck a == '3'? No. '5'? Yes \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nNext j=2:\n\na is s[0] \u2192 '3'.\n\nNow, since f is true, append '3' (the original a).\n\nSo the sb after the loop is:\n\nFirst step: '3'\n\nSecond step: '7' \u2192 so after j=1, sb is \"37\".\n\nThird step: append '3' \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, check if f was set (yes, so no need to append 3).\n\nThen reverse the sb \u2192 \"373\" reversed is \"373\", so next i is 373?\n\nWait, but the code says:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 which is \"373\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the code appends the characters in a certain way, then reverses the entire string.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code's steps:\n\nThe loop is processing the digits of i from right to left (since j starts at 0, and the first character is the last digit).\n\nThe code builds the new number as follows:\n\n- For each digit (starting from the rightmost), decide whether to modify it or not.\n\n- The 'f' flag indicates whether we've made a change yet.\n\n- The first digit (rightmost) that is 3 \u2192 becomes 5, and f is set to true.\n\n- If it's 5 \u2192 becomes 7, f set to true.\n\n- Else (like 7 or other digits?), it becomes 3, and f remains false.\n\nWait, but in the code, the else clause (when a is not 3 or 5) appends '3' and leaves f as false.\n\nWait, in the first example, the first digit (rightmost) is 7 (from 357). So in the first iteration (j=0):\n\na is '7', which is not 3 or 5 \u2192 so append '3', f remains false.\n\nThen, next digit (j=1) is '5' (the middle digit of 357). Since f is still false, check:\n\na is '5' \u2192 so append '7', set f to true.\n\nThen, next digit (j=2) is '3' (the first digit). Since f is now true, append the original '3'.\n\nSo the sb after the loop is '3' (from first step) + '7' (second step) + '3' (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set (true), we don't append 3 at the end.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed? Wait, no. The code does:\n\nsb2 = new StringBuffer(sb) \u2192 which is \"373\".\n\nThen, reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nWait, but the code says:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the reverse() is applied to the sb2, which is a copy of sb. So the sb2 is \"373\", then reversed becomes \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but in the example, the next i would be 373, which is larger than 357. So the loop continues until i exceeds N.\n\nThe count c is incremented whenever the current i contains all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nSo the code's logic is generating numbers in a certain way, and counting those that have all three digits.\n\nThe transformation step is a bit tricky. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nThe transformation seems to be generating the next number by incrementing the rightmost possible digit in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers generated are all numbers with digits 3,5,7, and the loop is generating them in order.\n\nWait, the initial i is 357, then next is 373, then 375, 377, 37... but perhaps the code is generating all numbers with digits 3,5,7 in some order, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code is generating numbers in a way similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7.\n\nThe transformation process is similar to incrementing a number in a custom base, where each digit can be 3,5,7, and when you increment, you carry over.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating all numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits, in order. For example, starting at 357, then 373, 375, 377, then 533, etc. But the exact way is determined by the transformation.\n\nThe key is to replicate this transformation in Fortran.\n\nThe problem is that in Fortran, handling strings and characters is a bit different, but manageable.\n\nFirst, the second program's input is N (the first program's output ans). The output is c, the count of numbers up to N that contain at least one 3,5,7 each.\n\nWait, no, the code's condition is:\n\nif (s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\")) \u2192 so the number must have at least one of each digit 3,5,7. So the count c is the number of such numbers \u2264 N.\n\nThe second program's output is c, which is then the input for the third program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nThe second program's logic in Fortran:\n\nWe need to:\n\nInitialize i = 357.\n\nc =0.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   Convert i to a string s.\n\n   Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7' \u2192 if yes, increment c.\n\n   Compute the next i via the transformation.\n\nThe transformation is the key part.\n\nLet me think of the transformation steps.\n\nThe code's transformation steps:\n\nThe string s is the current i's digits.\n\nWe process the digits from right to left (since the loop starts with the last character).\n\nWe build a new string by modifying the digits, starting from the right.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a new string (sb).\n\nf is a flag indicating whether we've made a change yet.\n\nFor each digit (starting from the end of s):\n\n   if not f:\n\n       if current digit is '3' \u2192 replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n       else if '5' \u2192 replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n       else (like '7' or other digits?) \u2192 replace with '3', leave f as false.\n\n   else:\n\n       append the original digit.\n\nAfter processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning no change was made?), then append '3' to the end.\n\nThen reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is over the characters in s, processing from the end to the beginning (since j starts at 0, and the first character is s.length-1 -0 \u2192 last character).\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int j =0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\n   char a = s.charAt(s.length() -1 -j);\n\n   ... process a ...\n\n}\n\nSo for j=0, it's the last character of s.\n\nj=1 \u2192 second last, etc.\n\nThe processing builds the new string by appending to sb in the order of the processed digits (from last to first), but with some modifications.\n\nWait, the code appends to sb in the order of processing, so the first character processed (the last digit of s) is the first character in sb. Then, after processing all, the sb is reversed to form the next number.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe code appends to sb in the order of processing the digits from right to left (last to first). So the resulting sb is the modified digits in the order of right to left. Then, when reversed, it becomes the next number in the correct order.\n\nWait, for example, in the first step with i=357 (s is \"357\"):\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nsince f is false, and a is '7', which is not 3 or 5 \u2192 append '3' to sb. f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (5):\n\nstill f is false. a is '5' \u2192 replace with '7', set f to true. append '7' to sb.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append the original '3' to sb.\n\nSo the sb after processing is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the code reverses this sb \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's next i is the reversed string of the sb. So the sb is \"373\", reversed is \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: let's say i is 373 (s is \"373\").\n\nProcessing digits from right to left: 3,7,3.\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false. a is '3' \u2192 replace with '5', set f to true. append '5' to sb.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\".\n\nReversed \u2192 \"375\" \u2192 next i is 375.\n\nWait, no, wait: the sb is \"573\", reversed becomes \"375\".\n\nAh, right. So the next i is 375.\n\nSo the transformation is building the next number by modifying the rightmost possible digit that can be increased, similar to incrementing in a base-3 system with digits 3,5,7.\n\nThe algorithm is similar to counting in base 3, where each digit can be 3,5,7, and when you increment, you carry over.\n\nThe code's transformation is effectively generating the next number in this sequence.\n\nNow, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nWe need to process the digits of i as a string, then perform the transformation steps.\n\nIn Fortran, handling strings can be done with character arrays.\n\nFirst, the steps for the transformation:\n\nGiven current i (as a string s):\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each character from the end to the beginning (right to left).\n\n3. Build a new string (sb) as per the rules.\n\n4. If no changes were made (f remains false), append '3' to the end of sb.\n\n5. Reverse the sb to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the code's steps are:\n\nAfter building the sb (processing from right to left, appending to sb in that order), then reverse the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the digits from right to left, and appending to sb in that order. So the first character processed (the last digit of s) is the first character in sb. The next digit (second last) is next, etc. So the sb is the modified digits in reverse order of the original digits. Then, reversing it gives the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the next i is the reversed sb.\n\nSo in code terms:\n\nThe next i is the reversed string of the modified sb.\n\nNow, in Fortran, to implement this:\n\nWe can write a function to compute the next i given the current i.\n\nAlternatively, in the loop:\n\ncurrent_i = 357\n\ndo while (current_i <= N)\n\n   process to check if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 increment c if yes.\n\n   compute next_i via the transformation.\n\n   current_i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nThe key is to compute next_i from current_i.\n\nImplementing the transformation:\n\nFunction next_i(current_i) result (next_val)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: current_i\n\n   character(len=20) :: s, sb, temp\n\n   integer :: len, j, pos\n\n   logical :: f\n\n   s = trim(adjustl( str(current_i) )) \u2192 need a function to convert integer to string.\n\nWait, in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statements.\n\nAlternatively, use a function like:\n\nfunction intToStr(n) result(s)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') n\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\nend function\n\nSimilarly, converting a string to integer:\n\nfunction strToInt(s) result(n)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   read(s, *) n\n\nend function\n\nSo assuming these helper functions exist.\n\nNow, the steps for the transformation:\n\nGiven current_i as an integer:\n\ns = intToStr(current_i)\n\nlen = len_trim(s)\n\nf = .false.\n\nsb = ''\n\ndo j = 1, len\n\n   pos = len -

j +1).\n\nWait, for j=1 \u2192 position len \u2192 last character of s.\n\nj=2 \u2192 position len-1 \u2192 second last, etc.\n\nSo the loop is over each character from the end to the beginning.\n\nThe sb is built by appending the transformed characters in the order of processing (so the first character processed is first in sb).\n\nAfter processing all, if f is false, append '3'.\n\nThen, reverse the sb to get the next string.\n\nWait, the code's next i is the reversed sb.\n\nWait, in the code example earlier, when processing 357:\n\nThe sb after processing is \"373\", then reversed gives \"373\".\n\nWait, but in the code's example, the next i was 373, which is correct.\n\nAnother example with 373:\n\nProcessing the digits '3','7','3' (s is \"373\").\n\nProcessing from the end (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3 at position 3):\n\ncurrent_char is '3' \u2192 since f is false, replace with '5', set f to true. sb becomes '5'.\n\nSecond character (7 at position 2):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7' \u2192 sb is '57'.\n\nThird character (3 at position 1):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 sb is '573'.\n\nThen, since f is true, no append '3'.\n\nReverse '573' \u2192 '375', so next i is 375.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the transformation can be implemented as above.\n\nNow, the second program's output is c, which is the count of numbers up to N (the first program's output) that contain all three digits.\n\nNow, moving to the third program (codeforces_678_B):\n\nThe third program reads an integer y (the second program's output c), and finds the smallest year after y such that:\n\n- The number of days from y to that year (inclusive?) is a multiple of 7.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nThe code starts with y = in.nextInt();\n\nleap = check_leap(y).\n\nsum =0.\n\nThen, for i from y+1 upwards:\n\n   if check_leap(i) \u2192 add 366 to sum.\n\n   else \u2192 add 365.\n\n   if sum mod7 ==0:\n\n       if ( (leap and check_leap(i)) or (not leap and not check_leap(i)) ) \u2192 then print i and exit.\n\n       else \u2192 continue.\n\nWait, the condition is checking whether the current year i has the same leap status as the original year y?\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) )\n\nSo, if the current year i is a leap year and the original y was a leap year, or if both are not leap \u2192 then it's acceptable.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nThe idea is that the total days must be a multiple of 7, and the leap status of the current year must match the original's leap status?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the next year must have the same leap status as the original year y, but I'm not sure. The code's logic is as written.\n\nThe code loops i from y+1 upwards, accumulating the days from y+1 to i (or up to i?), and checks when the sum mod7 is 0, and the leap status matches.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n\n    if (check_leap(i)) {\n\n        sum += 366;\n\n    } else {\n\n        sum += 365;\n\n    }\n\n    if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n        if ( (check_leap(i) == leap) ) \u2192 because ( (a && b) || (!a && !b) ) is equivalent to (a == b).\n\n            then print and return.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is whether the leap status of i is the same as the original y's leap status.\n\nSo the code is looking for the first i > y such that:\n\nsum of days from y+1 to i (inclusive?) is divisible by 7, and i has the same leap status as y.\n\nWait, the sum is the total days from y+1 up to i. Because each iteration adds the days of i (since i starts at y+1, first iteration adds days of y+1, then next adds days of y+2, etc. So the sum after i iterations is the total days from y+1 to i.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\ni starts at y+1.\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nsum += days of i (y+1).\n\nThen check if sum mod7 ==0.\n\nIf yes, check if leap status of i matches y's leap status.\n\nIf so, return i.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nSo the total days from y+1 to i (the current i) must be divisible by 7, and the current i's leap status must match y's.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest such i.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the code would:\n\nRead y (the second program's output c).\n\nCompute leap = check_leap(y).\n\nsum =0\n\nloop i from y+1 upwards:\n\n   if check_leap(i) \u2192 add 366 to sum.\n\n   else \u2192 add 365.\n\n   if mod(sum,7) ==0:\n\n       if check_leap(i) == leap \u2192 then print i and exit.\n\nThus, the third program's output is the desired final result.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire Fortran program must:\n\n1.

So perhaps the code should initialize sb as a space, then in the loop, append characters, and then trim it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use a character variable of length 20, and set it to empty by using:\n\nsb = ''\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use a character variable and build it step by step, and it will work.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the compute_next function's reversal of the sb.\n\nThe code:\n\nnext_str = ''\n\ndo j = len_trim(sb),1,-1\n\n   next_str = next_str // sb(j:j)\n\nend do\n\nThis should reverse the string.\n\nTesting with the example of sb being '373', the loop would go from 3 to 1:\n\nj=3 \u2192 sb(3:3) is '3', so next_str becomes '3'\n\nj=2 \u2192 '7' \u2192 next_str becomes '37'\n\nj=1 \u2192 '3' \u2192 next_str becomes '373'\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: sb is '573' (from processing 373):\n\nlen_trim(sb) is 3.\n\nj=3 \u2192 '3', next_str starts as '3'\n\nj=2 \u2192 '7' \u2192 '37'\n\nj=1 \u2192 '5' \u2192 '375' \u2192 which is correct.\n\nThus, the reversal code is correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all steps.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first program's array indices: in Java, arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran, they are 1-based. The code uses 1-based, which is correct.\n\n- The check for max_b: initialized to -1, which is correct since b can be up to 9 (since r[i] is mod 10, so 1-9, so 10 - r[i] is 1-9).\n\n- The second program's loop: the compute_next function must correctly generate the next i.\n\n- The third program's loop may take a long time for large y, but since it's a programming competition problem, it's expected to handle it.\n\nNow, compiling and testing this code may reveal any issues, but given the time constraints, this is the best possible translation."
