So digits(0) =3, digits(1)=2, digits(2)=1, digits(3)=0.\n\n   !

Let me adjust:\n\nIn the third part:\n\ninteger :: L = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate(digits(0:L+1)) \u2192 no, wait, the original code's digits array is length L+1 (for L being the length of the input string). So in Fortran, to avoid the out-of-bounds, perhaps the digits array should be of size L+2, so that when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is within the array. So:\n\ndigits = allocate(0:L+1) Then, the loop runs from i=0 to L (since the original code's loop is up to L). Thus, in Fortran:\n\ndigits = allocate(0:L+1)\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   pos = L -i \u2192 wait, no, the original code's loop for the digits array is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L-1 (since number.length() is L).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_31_A) reads an integer n and an array of n integers. It checks if any element in the array is the sum of two other distinct elements. If found, it outputs the indices (1-based) of the triplet, otherwise -1. The output here is the input for the next program?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final Fortran program should process all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input and the last producing output. The intermediate steps must process data without I/O.\n\nHmm, so the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program, which then outputs to the third. So in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java file) will read the initial input, process it, and pass the result to the second part (second Java file's logic), which then passes its result to the third part (third Java's logic), and finally the third part outputs the result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must chain these three steps together, with no I/O in between except the first read and the final write.\n\nLet me look at each Java program's input and output.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_31_A):\n\nInput: first line is n, then n integers. Output is either three numbers (indices) or -1.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nInput is a single integer x. It outputs the smallest prime number greater than or equal to x, but if x is even and not 2, it starts checking from x+1 (since even numbers except 2 can't be prime). Wait, the code's logic: if x is not 2 and even, then x is incremented to x+1 (so it becomes odd). Then it loops, checking if x is prime. If not, add 2 (to keep it odd) and check again. The output is the first prime >= original x (but adjusted for evenness).\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC155_E):\n\nInput is a string representing a number. It processes the digits to compute some bills, probably the minimal number of coins or something. The output is the computed bills.\n\nWait, the third program's input is a number as a string. The first program's output is either three numbers or -1. So the first program's output must be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a single integer x. So the first program's output must be a single integer? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is either three numbers (like \"a b c\") or \"-1\". But the second program expects a single integer x. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But the first program's output can be three numbers or -1. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is either \"k+1 j+1 i+1\" (three numbers) or \"-1\". So the output is either three integers or a single -1. The second program expects a single integer x. So how does that work? The second program's input is a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But in the case where the first program outputs three numbers, that would be three numbers, which can't be parsed as a single integer. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is only the first number? Or maybe the problem's setup is different.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the second program's input is the first program's output. But the second program's input is a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. But the first program can output three numbers or -1. That's a problem. Unless the first program's output is only the first number when it's three numbers, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the first number (k+1) when it's three numbers, and -1 otherwise. But the code in the first Java program prints all three numbers when f is 1. So the output is three numbers separated by spaces, or -1. So the second program would read that as input. But the second program expects a single integer. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is only the first number when it's three numbers, but that's not the case. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the first number (k+1) when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs all three. So this suggests that the sequence of programs may not be compatible. But the problem says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, so their outputs must be compatible. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the first number when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs three numbers. That would be a problem. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the first Java program's code.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code again:\n\nThe first program's output is either:\n\nif (f == 1) System.out.println(k + 1 + \" \" + (j + 1) + \" \" + (i + 1));\n\nelse System.out.println(\"-1\");\n\nSo the output is three numbers separated by spaces, or -1. The second program expects a single integer x. So the second program would read the first number from the first program's output. For example, if the first program outputs \"3 5 7\", then the second program would read 3 as x. If the first program outputs \"-1\", then the second program would read -1 as x. But the second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC149_C {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int x = Integer.parseInt(stdIn.next());\n        if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n        // ... etc.\n\nSo the second program reads the first token from the input, which is the first number in the first program's output. So if the first program outputs three numbers, the second program takes the first one. If it outputs -1, then x is -1, but then the code would process that. However, the second program's logic may not handle negative numbers. Let me see:\n\nThe second program's code starts with:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n\nSo if x is -1, then x is odd (since -1 is odd). So the code proceeds. Then it checks for primes. But primes are positive integers greater than 1. So if x is -1, the code would enter the loop and try to find a prime, but since primes are positive, this would be an error. So perhaps the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but according to the code, it can output three numbers. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is only the first number when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs all three. This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is actually a single integer, but the code is written to output three numbers. That can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first number (k+1) when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs all three. So the second program would read the first number. But the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output must be a single integer. Therefore, perhaps the first program's code is actually different. Wait, maybe I misread the first Java code. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code:\n\nThe output is either three numbers (k+1, j+1, i+1) or -1. So the output is either three numbers or a single number. The second program expects a single integer. So the first program's output must be a single integer. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only the first number when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs all three. That would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first number when it's three numbers, but the code actually outputs all three, but the second program only reads the first token. So in the Fortran program, when translating, the first part's output (the three numbers or -1) must be passed to the second part as a single integer. So the first part's output is the first number of the triplet, or -1. So in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the first number (k+1) when found, or -1, and pass that to the second part. The second part then takes that as x, and so on.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the first part must process the input, compute the first number (k+1) if found, else -1, and pass that to the second part. The second part then processes that x, computes the next value, and passes it to the third part, which then outputs the final result.\n\nSo the first Java program's output is either three numbers (so the first is the first number) or -1. The second program takes that first number (or -1) as x. But the second program's code may not handle x=-1. Let me see:\n\nIn the second Java program, if x is -1, then the code would do:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 ==0) x++;\n\nSince x is -1, which is odd, so the condition is false. So x remains -1. Then the loop starts:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    int i;\n\n    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n    for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n        if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n    }\n\n    if (i> sqrtNum) break;\n\n    x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, but x is -1. The sqrt of -1 is not a real number, so Math.sqrt(-1) would throw an exception. So the second program would crash if x is -1. Therefore, the first program's output must not be -1. So perhaps the first program's output is always three numbers, so the first number is passed to the second program. But how can that be? The first program's code can output -1 if no triplet is found. So the problem's setup must ensure that the first program's output is a valid input for the second program. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always three numbers, so the first number is passed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first number when it's three numbers, and the second program ignores the rest. So in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the first number (k+1) when found, else -1, but the second program can't handle -1, so the first program's output must be a valid x for the second program. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always three numbers, so the first number is passed. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the first number when found, else the second program's input is -1, but that would cause an error. Therefore, the problem's setup must have the first program's output being a valid input for the second program. So the first program must not output -1. Therefore, the input to the first program must be such that there exists a triplet. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so we have to handle all cases.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, so the first number is passed to the second program. The second program's output is a prime number, which is then passed to the third program as a string. Wait, the third program expects a string input, which is a number. So the second program's output is a number (like 7, 13, etc.), which is then passed as a string to the third program. So the third program's input is the string representation of that number.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nFirst program's input: n followed by n numbers. Output is three numbers (a b c) or -1. The second program takes the first number (a) as x. Then the second program outputs a prime number (x or higher). The third program takes that prime number as a string input and processes it.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the first part must compute the first number (a) when found, else -1, then pass that to the second part. The second part computes the prime, then passes it as a string to the third part, which computes the bills.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate each Java program into Fortran code, connected in sequence, with only the first reading input and the last writing output.\n\nLet me start with the first Java program (codeforces_31_A):\n\nThe first program reads n, then n integers into an array. Then it checks for any element a[k] which is the sum of two other elements a[i] and a[j], where i and j are different from k and each other. The first such triplet found is output as (k+1, j+1, i+1). The first occurrence is the first k where this is true, and the first i and j for that k.\n\nWait, the code's loops are a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe code loops over k from 0 to n-1. For each k, it sets t = a[k]. Then loops over i from 0 to n-1. For each i, loops j from 0 to n-2 (since j < n-1). Wait, the inner loop is for j from 0 to n-2? Wait, the code says:\n\nfor (j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {\n\nWait, the innermost loop is j from 0 to n-2. Wait, but the condition is j < n-1, so j goes up to n-2. But the loop is inside the i loop. Wait, perhaps the code is checking all pairs (i,j) where i != j, but the loops are not properly covering all possible pairs. Let me see:\n\nThe code's logic is:\n\nfor each k (element to check if it's the sum of two others):\n\n   t = a[k]\n\n   for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      for j from 0 to n-2:\n\n          if i != j and t == a[i] + a[j], then set f=1 and break.\n\n      if found (f=1), break the i loop.\n\n   if found, break the k loop.\n\nSo the first k where such a pair (i,j) exists is found, and the first i and j for that k are the first i and j encountered in the loops. But the loops may not be checking all possible pairs. Wait, the j loop is up to n-2, so j can be up to n-2, but the a array has indices up to n-1. So j can be from 0 to n-2, but the a[j] can be up to n-2, but the other element a[i] can be up to n-1. Wait, but the code's j loop is j < n-1, so j can be 0 to n-2. So the j loop is missing the last element (n-1) in the array. That's a bug in the original code? Or maybe it's a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, the code's innermost loop is for j from 0 to n-2. So j can be up to n-2. But the a array has indices up to n-1. So the j loop is missing the last element. That's a problem. Wait, perhaps it's a typo. The code says j < n-1, so j can be up to n-2. So the j loop is not covering all possible j's. That's a bug in the original code. But since we have to translate it as is, we need to replicate that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to loop j from 0 to n-1, but the code has a typo. But since the problem says to translate the given code, we have to follow it exactly.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the loops must be exactly as in the Java code.\n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran:\n\nThe first part reads n, then an array of n integers. Then loops over k from 0 to n-1 (Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit indices). Wait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So perhaps better to use 1-based indices here.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, to replicate exactly, perhaps we can use 0-based arrays. But Fortran doesn't support 0-based by default. So we can declare the array with a lower bound of 0. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: a\n\nBut in Fortran, the size must be known at compile time, but here n is read from input. So we need to use an allocatable array.\n\nAlternatively, since the first part is the first block, we can read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n integers into array a (0-based).\n\nInitialize variables: f = 0, k, i, j.\n\nLoop over k from 0 to n-1:\n\n   t = a(k)\n\n   loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      loop over j from 0 to n-2:\n\n          if (i /= j) then\n\n              if (t == a(i) + a(j)) then\n\n                  f = 1\n\n                  exit j loop\n\n              end if\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (f == 1) exit i loop\n\n   end do\n\n   if (f == 1) exit k loop\n\nend do\n\nAfter loops, if f is 1, then output is (k+1, j+1, i+1). But in Fortran, since we can't output here, we need to store the values of k, i, j and pass them to the next part.\n\nWait, but the first part's output is the first number (k+1) when found, else -1. So the first part's result is:\n\nif f == 1 then result = k + 1 else -1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first number. So the first part's output is the first number (k+1) when found, else -1. So in the Fortran code, after processing, the first part must compute this value and pass it to the second part.\n\nSo variables needed:\n\nAfter the loops, if f is 1, then the first number is k+1 (since in Java it's k+1). So in Fortran, the first part's output is (k + 1) if found, else -1.\n\nSo the first part's result is an integer, which is passed to the second part.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nThe second program takes an integer x as input. It then finds the smallest prime number >= x, with some adjustments for even numbers.\n\nThe code's logic:\n\nif x is not 2 and even, then x is incremented to x+1 (so it becomes odd).\n\nThen, in a loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(x) as sqrtNum.\n\nloop i from 3 to sqrtNum, step 2 (since even divisors can be skipped).\n\nif any i divides x, then break and increment x by 2 (to keep it odd).\n\nElse, if no divisors found (i exceeds sqrtNum), then x is prime, break loop.\n\nThe output is x.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part takes the first part's result (x) and computes the next prime.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nThe second part's input is x (from first part). The output is the computed prime.\n\nNow, the third Java program (atcoder_ABC155_E):\n\nThe third program reads a string representing a number. It processes the digits to compute the minimal number of bills (or coins?), perhaps in a way similar to the minimal coins needed to represent the number in some system.\n\nThe code:\n\nThe input is a string \"number\".\n\ndigits array is of length number.length() +1, initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for each character in the string (from the end to the start), the digits array is filled with the digits in reverse order (since the first digit is the least significant digit?).\n\nWait, the code loops over i from 0 to number.length()-1:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0'\n\nWait, the first character (index 0) of the string is the first digit (leftmost), but the code is taking the last character first. For example, if the input is \"123\", then number.length() is 3. The first iteration (i=0):\n\nnumber.length() -1 -i = 3-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 the third character (index 2) is '3', so digits[0] = 3.\n\nThen i=1: 3-1-1=1 \u2192 second character '2' \u2192 digits[1] =2.\n\ni=2: 3-1-2=0 \u2192 first character '1' \u2192 digits[2] =1.\n\ndigits[3] is initialized to 0 (since the array is length 4, indices 0-3).\n\nThen, the code processes the digits array from i=0 to i=number.length() (which is 3 in the example). Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to number.length() (since the array is length number.length()+1, so the last index is number.length()).\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++):\n\nSo for a string of length L, the loop runs from 0 to L (inclusive). The digits array has L+1 elements.\n\nThe processing:\n\nfor each digit in digits array (starting from least significant digit?):\n\nif the current digit is 10 (which can't happen?), but perhaps it's a carryover?\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 set digits[i+1] +=1 and digits[i] =0.\n\nWait, but how can digits[i] be 10? The initial digits are set from the input string's characters, which are 0-9. So perhaps this is part of a carryover process.\n\nWait, the code's processing is:\n\nbills is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over each digit from i=0 to L (the length of the original number):\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10 \u2192 if so, carry over to next digit.\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, add to bills.\n\nThe code's logic:\n\nThe problem is to compute the minimal number of coins (or bills) needed to represent the number, where each digit can be represented in a certain way. The code seems to be handling a system where each digit can be represented as 0-9, but with some rules for rounding up or down.\n\nWait, the code's comments mention \"bills\" but the problem is from ABC155 E, which is about a specific problem. Let me think.\n\nThe code's processing:\n\nThe digits array is processed from the least significant digit (since the first digit in the array is the last digit of the input string). The code is handling each digit, possibly with carries.\n\nThe code's steps for each digit i:\n\n1. If the current digit is 10, then it's a carryover from the previous step. So we add 1 to the next digit (i+1) and set current digit to 0.\n\nWait, but how does the digit become 10? Maybe during the processing of previous digits, when a digit exceeds 10, but that's unclear. Let me see the code again.\n\nWait, the code's first step in the loop is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 set digits[i] to 0 and increment digits[i+1].\n\nWait, but how does digits[i] become 10? Maybe this is part of the processing for digits that are over 5?\n\nLooking further:\n\nThe code then checks if digits[i] <5 \u2192 add to bills.\n\nElse if digits[i] ==5 \u2192 add 5 to bills, and check the next digit's carry.\n\nElse (digits[i] >5) \u2192 add (10 - digits[i]) to bills, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to compute the minimal number of coins where each coin is 1, 5, or 10 units. But the code's logic is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to compute the minimal number of coins in a system where each digit can be represented in a way that requires certain coins. The code's approach is to process each digit, handling carries and choosing the minimal coins.\n\nThe code's logic for each digit:\n\n- If the digit is 10, it's a carryover from the previous digit's processing. So we need to carry over to the next digit.\n\n- Then, if the digit is less than 5, we can use that many coins of 1.\n\n- If it's exactly 5, we use one 5-coin, but if the next digit is >=5, we carry over 1 to the next digit (so that the next digit's value is increased, which might allow a better combination).\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) digits[i+1]++;\n\n    bills +=5;\n\n}\n\nElse if digits[i] >5:\n\n    digits[i+1] +=1\n\n    bills += 10 - digits[i]\n\nSo for digits[i] >5, we take (10 - digits[i]) coins of 1, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nWait, perhaps the coins are in denominations of 1, 5, and 10, but the code is trying to minimize the total coins by choosing between using 5 or 10 coins when possible.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to represent the number in a way where each digit is rounded to the nearest 5, but the code's logic is a bit more involved.\n\nIn any case, the code's processing is as follows:\n\nThe digits array is processed from the least significant digit (i=0) to the most significant (i = L). For each digit:\n\n- If it's 10, carry over to next digit.\n\n- Then, based on the digit's value, add to bills and carry over as needed.\n\nThe final bills is the output.\n\nIn Fortran, the third part must take the second part's output (the prime number) as a string, process it as per the code, and output the bills.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire Fortran program will have three sections:\n\n1. Read input (n and array a), process first part, compute x (the first number or -1).\n\n2. Process x through the second part's logic to get the prime number.\n\n3. Convert the prime number to a string, process through the third part's logic, and output the bills.\n\nNow, let's start coding each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_31_A):\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array.\n\nThen loop over k, i, j as per the Java code.\n\nWe need to track the first occurrence where a[k] = a[i] + a[j], with i != j and k can be any index.\n\nWait, the code's loops are:\n\nfor k from 0 to n-1:\n\n   t = a[k]\n\n   for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      for j from 0 to n-2:\n\n          if (i != j) and (t == a[i] + a[j]) \u2192 set f=1 and break loops.\n\nSo the first k where this is true is found, and the first i and j for that k are recorded.\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to track the first occurrence.\n\nVariables needed:\n\ninteger :: n, a(0:n-1), f =0, k_val, i_val, j_val.\n\nWait, but n is read first, so we need to read n, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, we can read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, x, prime, bills\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\ninteger :: f, k, i, j, t, k_found, i_found, j_found\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n! First part:\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1))\n\nread*, a(0:n-1)\n\nf =0\n\nk_found = -1\n\ni_found = -1\n\nj_found = -1\n\ndo k =0, n-1\n\n   t = a(k)\n\n   do i =0, n-1\n\n      do j =0, n-2\n\n         if (i /= j) then\n\n            if (t == a(i) + a(j)) then\n\n               f =1\n\n               k_found =k\n\n               i_found =i\n\n               j_found =j\n\n               exit\n\n            end if\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (f ==1) exit\n\n   end do\n\n   if (f ==1) exit\n\nend do\n\nif (f ==1) then\n\n   x = k_found +1\n\nelse\n\n   x =-1\n\nend if\n\n! Second part:\n\n! Compute prime from x\n\n! ... code here ...\n\n! Third part:\n\n! Convert prime to string, process, output bills\n\n! ... code here ...\n\nend program\n\nWait, but the second part must take x and compute the prime.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nThe second part's input is x (from first part). The code must compute the smallest prime >=x, with the adjustments for even numbers.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nif x is not 2 and even \u2192 x +=1.\n\nthen loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(x) \u2192 sqrt_num.\n\nloop i from 3 to sqrt_num step 2.\n\nif any i divides x \u2192 break and increment x by 2.\n\nelse \u2192 break loop and return x.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: x, prime\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\nprime = x\n\nif (prime /=2 .and. mod(prime,2) ==0) then\n\n   prime = prime +1\n\nend if\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   integer :: sqrt_num, i\n\n   sqrt_num = int(sqrt(real(prime)))\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n      if (mod(prime, i) ==0) then\n\n         is_prime = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      prime = prime +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop in the Java code is a bit different. Let me re-express the Java code's logic:\n\nThe Java code's loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    int i;\n\n    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n    for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n        if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n    }\n\n    if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n    x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo the loop continues until the for loop completes without breaking (i exceeds sqrtNum), then break the while loop.\n\nIn Fortran, the code can be written as:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   sqrt_num = nint(sqrt(real(prime)))  ! Or use int?\n\n   ! Or better to compute as integer.\n\n   sqrt_num = int(sqrt(real(prime)))\n\n   ! Check if prime is 1 or 0?\n\n   if (prime <2) then\n\n      ! Not prime, but according to problem's logic, perhaps x is at least 2?\n\n      ! But need to handle.\n\n      ! For now, assume prime is >=2.\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Check divisors from 3 to sqrt_num, step 2.\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n      if (mod(prime, i) ==0) then\n\n         is_prime = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      prime = prime +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the for loop, if the loop didn't break (i exceeds sqrtNum), then break the while loop. So the condition is equivalent to is_prime being true.\n\nThus, the Fortran code above is correct.\n\nNow, the third part:\n\nThe third part takes the prime number (prime) and converts it to a string, then processes it as per the Java code.\n\nThe third part's input is the prime number as a string. So in Fortran, we can convert the integer prime to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write and read:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') prime\n\ntrim(s) to remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process the digits as per the Java code.\n\nThe Java code's third program reads the input as a string, then processes each character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe digits array is of length (number of digits) +1.\n\nFirst, get the length of the string s.\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: L = len\n\ninteger, allocatable :: digits(:)\n\nallocate(digits(0:L))\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   ! The first character is the first digit (most significant?), but in the Java code, the digits are stored in reverse.\n\n   ! The Java code does:\n\n   ! for (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n   !    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length()-1 -i) - '0';\n\n   ! }\n\n   ! So for the string \"123\", the digits array would be [3,2,1,0].\n\n   ! So in Fortran, for s being the string, the first character is s(1:1), which is the first digit (most significant).\n\n   ! To reverse, for i from 0 to L-1:\n\n   ! the character at position (L -i) is the ith character in the reversed array.\n\n   ! Wait, let's see:\n\n   ! For i from 0 to L-1:\n\n   ! the original string's character at position (L -i) ?\n\n   ! Let me think with example s = \"123\" (len=3):\n\n   ! i=0 \u2192 L -i =3 \u2192 s(3:3) is '3'\n\n   ! i=1 \u2192 L -i =2 \u2192 s(2:2) is '2'\n\n   ! i=2 \u2192 L -i =1 \u2192 s(1:1) is '1'\n\n   ! So digits(0) =3, digits(1)=2, digits(2)=1, digits(3)=0.\n\n   ! So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\n   do i=0, L-1\n\n      integer :: c = ichar(s(L -i: L -i)) - ichar('0')\n\n      digits(i) = c\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string indices start at 1. So for s being \"123\", s(1) is '1', s(2) is '2', s(3) is '3'.\n\nTo reverse the digits:\n\nfor i from 0 to L-1:\n\n   the character is s(L -i) \u2192 but when i=0 \u2192 L -0 = L \u2192 s(L) is the last character.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i =0, L-1\n\n   integer :: pos = L -i\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(s(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndigits(L) is initialized to 0.\n\nThen, process the digits array from i=0 to L (inclusive).\n\nThe processing loop:\n\nbills =0\n\ndo i=0, L\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L (since number.length() is L).\n\nBut in Fortran, the digits array is 0:L (size L+1). So the loop is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, when i reaches L (the last index), digits(i+1) would be digits(L+1), which is out of bounds. Because the array is allocated as 0:L (indices 0 to L). So when i = L, i+1 is L+1, which is beyond the array's upper bound. That's a problem.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array is of length number.length() +1 \u2192 so for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L). So in the loop, when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is beyond the array. But in the Java code, the array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so the last index is L. So in Java, when i is L, digits[i+1] would be out of bounds. Wait, that's a bug in the Java code?\n\nWait, the Java code's third program:\n\ndigits is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so indices 0 to L (since length is L+1). The loop is for (i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L (since number.length() is L). So when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is beyond the array's size. That's an array out of bounds error.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the Java code has a bug here. But since we have to translate it as is, perhaps the code is intended to have the digits array of size L+2? Or maybe the loop is up to L-1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches L, digits[i] is 0 (since initialized to 0), and the code may not access digits[i+1] in some cases.\n\nWait, let's look at the code's processing steps:\n\nIn the loop for each i from 0 to L (inclusive):\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10 \u2192 set to 0 and increment digits[i+1].\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, add to bills and possibly increment digits[i+1].\n\nBut when i is L (the last index), digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is beyond the array's bounds. So this is a bug in the original Java code. Therefore, the code may have an off-by-one error.\n\nAssuming that the code is correct as given, perhaps the digits array is actually of size L+2, but the code's declaration is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the loop is up to L-1. But according to the code, it's up to L.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since the problem requires us to translate the code exactly, we have to replicate this bug. But in Fortran, we can't have an array with an out-of-bounds access. So perhaps the code is intended to have the digits array of size L+2, so that digits[i+1] is within bounds when i is L.\n\nWait, the Java code's digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L). So when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So the code has a bug. Therefore, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to L-1, but the code has a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct because when i is L, the digits[i] is 0 (since initialized to 0), and the code may not need to access digits[i+1] in some cases.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWhen i = L:\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10 \u2192 if so, set to 0 and increment digits[i+1]. But digits[i+1] is out of bounds.\n\nThen, process the digit's value:\n\nif digits[i] <5 \u2192 add to bills.\n\nElse if ==5 \u2192 add 5 and check digits[i+1].\n\nElse \u2192 add (10 - digits[i]) and increment digits[i+1].\n\nSo in all cases except when digits[i] <5, the code accesses digits[i+1], which is out of bounds when i = L.\n\nThis is a bug. Therefore, the code may have an error, but since we have to translate it as is, perhaps the Fortran code must also have this bug. But in Fortran, we can't have that. So perhaps the original code's digits array is actually of size L+2, so that digits[i+1] is within bounds when i is L.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to L-1. Let me check the Java code again:\n\nThe loop is for (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L (since number.length() is L). So the code has a bug. Therefore, the correct approach is to assume that the digits array is of size L+2, so that digits[i+1] is within bounds when i is L.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the digits array should be allocated as 0 to L+1 (so size L+2). Let me adjust:\n\nIn the third part:\n\ninteger :: L = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate(digits(0:L+1)) \u2192 no, wait, the original code's digits array is length L+1 (for L being the length of the input string). So in Fortran, to avoid the out-of-bounds, perhaps the digits array should be of size L+2, so that when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is within the array.\n\nSo:\n\ndigits = allocate(0:L+1)\n\nThen, the loop runs from i=0 to L (since the original code's loop is up to L).\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndigits = allocate(0:L+1)\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   pos = L -i \u2192 wait, no, the original code's loop for the digits array is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L-1 (since number.length() is L).\n\nWait, the code's first loop (to fill the digits array):\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L-1.\n\nThus, the digits array's first L elements (indices 0 to L-1) are filled with the reversed digits. The rest (digits[L], digits[L+1]) are initialized to 0.\n\nWait, the original code's digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so indices 0 to L (since L = number.length()). The loop for filling the digits is for i from 0 to L-1 (since i < L). Thus, digits[L] is initialized to 0.\n\nThen, the processing loop is for i from 0 to L (inclusive). So when i is L, digits[i] is 0 (initial value), and digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds.\n\nThus, the code has a bug. To replicate this in Fortran, we can allocate digits as 0:L+1 (so indices 0 to L+1), so that when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is within the array.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndigits = allocate(0:L+1)\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   pos = L -i \u2192 no, wait, the original code's loop for filling the digits array is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to L-1.\n\nThe character is at position number.length() -1 -i \u2192 which is (L-1 -i).\n\nWait, the original code's code:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\nnumber.length() is L \u2192 so the index is L-1 -i.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   pos = L -1 -i +1 \u2192 wait, in Fortran, the string indices start at 1.\n\nWait, the original code's number is a string of length L. The first character is at index 0 (Java uses 0-based), so the character at position (L-1 -i) is the ith character from the end.\n\nIn Fortran, the string s has length L, with indices 1 to L.\n\nThus, the character at position (L -i) \u2192 because:\n\nfor i=0 \u2192 L-1 -0 \u2192 L-1 (Java's index) \u2192 in Fortran, that's position L.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's number is \"123\" (length 3). The first character (i=0) is at position 2 (since L-1 -0 =2 \u2192 '3'), which is the third character in the string (0-based). In Fortran, the string s is \"123\", so s(3:3) is '3'.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the position is (L -i) \u2192 because:\n\nfor i from 0 to L-1:\n\n   pos = L -i \u2192 but in Fortran, the first character is 1.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nJava's code for the first loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < L; i++) {\n\n   int charIndex = L-1 -i \u2192 which is the position from the end.\n\n   digits[i] = number.charAt(charIndex) - '0'\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the string s has length L, with characters s(1), s(2), ..., s(L).\n\nThe equivalent charIndex in Fortran would be (L -i) \u2192 because:\n\nfor i=0 \u2192 charIndex = L-1 -0 \u2192 L-1 (Java's index) \u2192 which is s(L) in Fortran.\n\nWait, no:\n\nJava's charIndex is L-1 -i \u2192 for i=0 \u2192 L-1 \u2192 which is the last character (index L-1 in Java, which is the last character).\n\nIn Fortran, the last character is s(L).\n\nThus, the Fortran code for filling the digits array should be:\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n   charIndex = L -i \u2192 because:\n\n   in Java, the character is at position (L-1 -i) \u2192 which is (L-1 -i) in 0-based \u2192 which is (L -i) in 1-based.\n\n   So in Fortran, s(charIndex:charIndex) is the correct character.\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(s(charIndex:charIndex)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndigits(L) is initialized to 0 (since the array is allocated to 0:L+1).\n\nNow, the processing loop:\n\ndo i=0, L\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, when i is L, digits(i+1) is digits(L+1), which is within the array's bounds (since it's allocated up to L+1).\n\nThus, the code is now safe.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNow, the entire Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, x, prime, bills\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\ninteger :: f, k, i, j, t, k_found, i_found, j_found\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n!

Output the result\n\nprint*, bills\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the second part, the initial prime is set to x, which could be -1. But in that case, the code would compute the prime for x=-1, which is invalid. However, according to the problem's setup, the first program's output must be valid for the second program. But since the problem requires us to translate the code exactly, including the possibility of x being -1, we have to handle it.\n\nIn the second part's code, when x is -1:\n\nprime = -1\n\nThen, the code checks if prime !=2 and even \u2192 since -1 is odd, so the condition is false. So prime remains -1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nsqrt_num = int(sqrt(-1.0)) \u2192 which is an error because sqrt of negative number is imaginary. Thus, the code would crash.\n\nBut the original Java code would also crash in this case. Since the problem requires us to translate the code exactly, we have to include this possibility. However, in practice, the first program's output is -1 only when no triplet is found, but the second program would then crash. But the problem says to translate the sequence as given, so we proceed.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is as above.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\nIn the first part's loops:\n\nThe j loop is from 0 to n-2. So in Fortran, the loop is j=0 to n-2.\n\nThe i loop is from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe k loop is from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe variables are properly tracked.\n\nThe second part's code handles the prime calculation.\n\nThe third part's code converts the prime to a string, processes the digits.\n\nThe final print statement outputs the bills.\n\nThis should replicate the behavior of the three Java programs in sequence."
