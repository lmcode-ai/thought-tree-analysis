    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality step by step.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string from input. It checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, it outputs \"Yes\"; else, \"No\". But in the sequence, the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, but the first program's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. The final output is from the third program.\n\nWait, but the user says the entire sequence should be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's input is the user's input, then its output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output. So the Fortran program must process the input through all three steps without I/O in between.\n\nHmm, so the steps are:\n\n1. Read input (from user) into first step's processing.\n2. Process first step (check for A and B, output \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n3. That output becomes the input to the second step.\n4. Second step processes it (the string from first's output) and produces its own output.\n5. Third step takes that output and processes it, then outputs the final result.\n\nWait, but the second Java program (atcoder_ARC062_B) takes a string S as input, then calculates a score based on each character. The first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second program's input is that string. Then the second's output is an integer score. Then the third program (atcoder_ABC051_A) takes that integer as input? Wait, no, the third program's input is a string. Wait, the third Java program's code is:\n\nThird program reads a line (a string) and replaces commas with spaces. So the input to the third program must be a string. But the second program's output is an integer (since it's printed with out.println(score)), so that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check each program again.\n\nFirst program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program's input is that string. The second program's code takes S as the input string. Then it calculates the score based on each character. Let's see:\n\nThe second program's solve method: S is the input string (from first's output). The code loops over each character in S. For each position i, if i is even (0-based), my is 'g', else 'p'. Then compares with the character in S. If they are different, adds 1 if my was 'p' (i.e., when i is odd), subtracts 1 if my was 'g' (i even). So the score is computed based on the input string.\n\nThe second program's output is the score as an integer. So the third program's input is that integer? But the third program expects a string input. Wait, the third Java program's code is:\n\nThird program reads a line (so the input is a string, which would be the output of the second program, which is an integer. So the input to the third program is the integer printed by the second program. So for example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program's input is \"5\", and it replaces commas with spaces. But \"5\" has no commas, so the output would be \"5\".\n\nWait, but the third program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC051_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        String a = br.readLine();\n        sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n        System.out.println(sb);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line (the entire line), then replaces any commas in that string with spaces, then outputs it. So if the input to the third program is the output of the second (which is an integer like \"5\"), then the third program's output is the same as the input, since there are no commas. But if the second program's output was, say, \"12,34\", then the third would output \"12 34\".\n\nWait, but the second program's output is an integer, so it would be written as a string without commas. So the third program's input is a string that's the integer from the second program, so the third program's output is the same as the second's output. Unless the second's output has a comma, which it can't because it's an integer. So the third program's output is the same as the second's output. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string. The second program takes that string as input. Let's see:\n\nFirst program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program's input is that string. Let's see what the second program does with that.\n\nSuppose first outputs \"Yes\". Then the second program's S is \"Yes\". Let's see the code:\n\nFor each character in \"Yes\" (indices 0,1,2):\n\ni=0 (even): my is 'g', his is 'Y' (assuming case matters? Wait, in Java, the code uses 'g' and 'p' lowercase, but the input is \"Yes\" which has uppercase letters. Wait, the code in the second program's solve method:\n\nchar my = i%2 ==0 ? 'g' : 'p';\nchar his = S.charAt(i);\n\nSo comparing lowercase 'g' or 'p' with the input's characters. So for \"Yes\", the first character is 'Y', which is uppercase. So 'Y' vs 'g' (since i=0 is even). They are different, so the score is added 1 if my was 'p' (no, my is 'g' here). Wait, the code says:\n\nif (my != his) {\n    score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g', and they are different, then add -1. So for the first character (Y vs g), different, so subtract 1. Then i=1 (odd), my is 'p', his is 'e'. Different, so add 1. i=2 (even), my is 'g', his is 's'. Different, so subtract 1. So total score is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So the second program would output -1. Then the third program takes \"-1\" as input (the string \"-1\"), and replaces commas with spaces. Since there are none, outputs \"-1\".\n\nSo the final output is the same as the second's output. But the third program's code is to replace commas with spaces. So if the second's output is a number with no commas, the third just outputs it as is. So the third program's output is the same as the second's output. So the entire sequence's final output is the second's output. Wait, but the third program is part of the sequence, so the third's output is the final output. So the third program's processing is necessary even if it doesn't change the output. So in the Fortran program, I have to process through all three steps.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first step reading input, the last step writing output, and the intermediate steps processing without I/O.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input string (from user) into first step's processing (check for A and B, output \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n2. Take that result (string) and process through the second step (compute the score based on each character's comparison with 'g'/'p' alternately, output the integer score as a string).\n\n3. Take that integer string and process through the third step (replace commas with spaces, output the result).\n\nWait, but in the second step, the output is an integer, so in Fortran, when we process the second step, we need to compute the integer and then convert it to a string for the third step. Because the third step requires a string input.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Read the initial input string (from user).\n\n- Process first step: check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. The result is a string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n- Then process second step: take that string, compute the score as per the second Java program's logic, resulting in an integer. Convert that integer to a string (since the third step needs a string input).\n\n- Then process third step: take that string (the integer as a string), replace any commas with spaces, then output the result.\n\nWait, but the second step's output is an integer, so when converting to a string, how is it represented? In Java, the second program's output is printed with out.println(score), which would be the integer as a string with no commas. So in Fortran, when converting the integer to a string, it's just the number as a string. So the third step's input is that string.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string (from user) into a variable, say, input_str.\n\n2. First step processing:\n\n   Check if input_str contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, set intermediate_str to \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n3. Second step processing:\n\n   Take intermediate_str, compute the score as per the second Java program's logic.\n\n   The score is an integer. Convert it to a string (e.g., using write statement to a string variable).\n\n4. Third step processing:\n\n   Take the score_str (the string representation of the score), replace any commas with spaces. The result is the final output_str.\n\n5. Output the final output_str.\n\nNow, how to implement each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first step:\n\nFortran strings can be checked for presence of characters. To check if a string contains 'A' and 'B', we can loop through each character and check for presence.\n\nAlternatively, use intrinsic functions. For example, using INDEX function:\n\nIf INDEX(input_str, 'A') > 0 and INDEX(input_str, 'B') > 0, then output \"Yes\".\n\nBut note that Fortran is case-sensitive. The original Java code uses 'A' and 'B' (uppercase?), but the input could be in any case? Wait, in the first Java code, the code uses s.contains(\"A\") and s.contains(\"B\"). So it's case-sensitive. So in Fortran, we need to check for uppercase 'A' and 'B' exactly.\n\nWait, the Java code's first program's solve method:\n\nif (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) { ... }\n\nSo it's checking for presence of 'A' and 'B' in the input string, case-sensitive. So in Fortran, the input_str must have at least one 'A' and one 'B' (uppercase) to output \"Yes\".\n\nSo first step code:\n\nRead input_str from user.\n\nCheck if 'A' is present and 'B' is present.\n\nThen set intermediate_str to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond step: compute the score.\n\nThe input for this step is intermediate_str (the \"Yes\" or \"No\" string).\n\nThe second step's logic is:\n\nInitialize score to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the string (each character's index from 0 to len-1).\n\nFor each position i:\n\nmy_char is 'g' if i is even, 'p' if odd.\n\nhis_char is the current character (from intermediate_str).\n\nIf my_char != his_char, then:\n\n   if my_char is 'p', add 1 to score.\n\n   else (my_char is 'g'), subtract 1 from score.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (my != his) {\n\n    score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n\n}\n\nSo when my is 'p', add 1. When my is 'g', subtract 1.\n\nSo for each character in the input string (intermediate_str):\n\ni starts at 0 (first character).\n\nSo for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\nmy_char = 'g' if i mod 2 ==0 else 'p'\n\nif my_char != his_char (current character):\n\n   if my_char is 'p', add 1.\n\n   else (my is 'g'), subtract 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, need to loop over each character in the intermediate_str.\n\nThe length of the string can be found with LEN_TRIM(intermediate_str).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can have trailing spaces, but assuming the input_str is read properly. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, when reading a string with read(*,*) or read(*,'(A)'), the input is read until a newline, but the exact handling may depend on the compiler. To read the entire line, perhaps using a fixed length or using an unformatted read. Alternatively, using a character array with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, using a character variable with a length sufficient to hold the input. Let's assume that the input is read into a sufficiently large string.\n\nSo for the second step:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over i from 1 to len (since Fortran is 1-based, but the indices in Java are 0-based. Wait, this is a problem. Because in Java, the indices start at 0, so for i=0 (first character), it's even. In Fortran, the first character is index 1, so we need to adjust the parity.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < S.length(); i++). So for the first character (i=0), it's even, so my is 'g'.\n\nIn Fortran, the first character is at position 1. So to replicate the same parity, the Fortran loop would be over i from 1 to len, and check if (i-1) is even. Because (i-1) would be 0 for the first character, which is even. So:\n\nfor each character in intermediate_str, position i (1-based):\n\ni_fortran = i (starting at 1)\n\ni_java = i_fortran -1\n\nso if (i_java) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even \u2192 my_char is 'g'\n\nElse \u2192 'p'\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n\n   current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n      my_char = 'g'\n\n   else\n\n      my_char = 'p'\n\n   end if\n\n   if (my_char /= current_char) then\n\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n         score = score +1\n\n      else\n\n         score = score -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are stored as single characters, so comparing with 'g' and 'p' (lowercase). The input string from the first step is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are uppercase letters. So the comparison between 'g' (lowercase) and 'Y' (uppercase) would be different. So the code in Java is case-sensitive here.\n\nWait, in the second Java program's code, the 'my' is 'g' or 'p' (lowercase), and the 'his' is the character from the input string (which could be uppercase). So in the comparison, 'g' vs 'Y' would be different, so the code would trigger the score change.\n\nIn Fortran, the same case sensitivity applies. So in the Fortran code, the 'g' and 'p' must be lowercase, and the input string (intermediate_str) is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are uppercase letters. So the comparisons will be case-sensitive, which is correct.\n\nSo the code for the second step is as above.\n\nOnce the score is computed, we need to convert it to a string. In Fortran, we can use an internal write statement:\n\nwrite(score_str, '(I0)') score\n\nThis will write the integer to a string without leading spaces, using the minimal number of digits.\n\nThird step: process the score_str (the string representation of the score) by replacing commas with spaces.\n\nThe third Java program's code is to replace all commas in the input string with spaces. So in Fortran, we can loop through each character in the score_str and replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use a string function. In Fortran, there's no built-in replace function, but we can do it manually.\n\nSo:\n\nresult_str = score_str\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n\n   if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      result_str(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so we can loop through each character and replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, using a loop:\n\nresult_str = adjustl(score_str)  ! Not sure if needed, but to get the actual length.\n\nThen loop over each character:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n\n   if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      result_str(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a substring like result_str(i:i), you can do that.\n\nSo after processing, the result_str is the final output.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the input string (from user).\n\n2. Process first step (check for A and B).\n\n3. Process second step (compute score).\n\n4. Convert score to string.\n\n5. Process third step (replace commas with spaces).\n\n6. Output the final string.\n\nNow, handling the input and output.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a line from stdin, we can use:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_str\n\nBut to read a line of arbitrary length, perhaps better to use a large enough buffer. Alternatively, use a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with sufficient length. Let's assume that the input is not too long. Let's set a maximum length, say 1000.\n\nSo variables:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str, intermediate_str, score_str, result_str\n\ninteger :: score\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead input_str.\n\nCheck for presence of 'A' and 'B'.\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   if (input_str(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (input_str(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   if (hasA .and. hasB) exit  ! can break early\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   intermediate_str = 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   intermediate_str = 'No'\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length. So when assigning 'Yes' to intermediate_str, which is length 1000, the rest will be spaces. But when we process the second step, we need to process only the actual characters. So when looping over intermediate_str, we should use len_trim(intermediate_str).\n\nAlternatively, set intermediate_str to exactly 'Yes' or 'No', but in Fortran, the variable is of length 1000, so the rest are spaces. But when processing, the loop in the second step will go up to len_trim(intermediate_str), which for 'Yes' is 3, so that's okay.\n\nWait, the second step's loop is over len_trim(intermediate_str). So the trailing spaces won't be considered. So that's okay.\n\nSecond step:\n\nscore =0\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n\n   current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n      my_char = 'g'\n\n   else\n\n      my_char = 'p'\n\n   end if\n\n   if (my_char /= current_char) then\n\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n         score = score +1\n\n      else\n\n         score = score -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert score to a string:\n\nwrite(score_str, '(I0)') score\n\nBut in Fortran, the write statement into a string requires an internal file. So perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: score_str\n\nwrite(score_str, '(I0)') score\n\nBut the length must be sufficient. Alternatively, use an edit descriptor that allows variable length.\n\nAlternatively, use an internal write with a format that can handle the number. Since the score can be negative, the string will have a '-' sign. So a length of 20 should be enough for typical cases.\n\nThird step:\n\nresult_str = score_str\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(result_str)\n\n   if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      result_str(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nFinally, output result_str.\n\nprint *, trim(result_str)\n\nWait, but the third program's output is the result_str after replacing commas with spaces. The print statement should output the entire string, trimming any trailing spaces (since the result_str may have trailing spaces from the initial assignment). Using trim ensures that.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=1000) :: input_str, intermediate_str, score_str, result_str\n  integer :: score, i\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*, '(A)') input_str\n\n  ! First step: check for A and B\n  hasA = .false.\n  hasB = .false.\n  do i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n     if (input_str(i:i) == 'A') then\n        hasA = .true.\n     else if (input_str(i:i) == 'B') then\n        hasB = .true.\n     end if\n     if (hasA .and. hasB) exit\n  end do\n\n  if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n     intermediate_str = 'Yes'\n  else\n     intermediate_str = 'No'\n  end if\n\n  ! Second step: compute score\n  score = 0\n  do i = 1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n     character :: current_char, my_char\n     current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n     if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n        my_char = 'g'\n     else\n        my_char = 'p'\n     end if\n     if (my_char /= current_char) then\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n           score = score + 1\n        else\n           score = score - 1\n        end if\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert score to string\n  write(score_str, '(I0)') score\n\n  ! Third step: replace commas with spaces\n  result_str = score_str\n  do i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n     if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n        result_str(i:i) = ' '\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result\n  print *, trim(result_str)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second step, the variables current_char and my_char are declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables can be declared in the loop's scope. Alternatively, declare them outside. Let me check:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ncurrent_char and my_char are declared as character variables. Since they are declared inside the loop, they are reinitialized each iteration. Alternatively, declare them before the loop.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid redeclaring each time, declare them before the loop:\n\nInside the second step:\n\ncharacter :: current_char, my_char\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n\n   current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n\n   ... etc.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n! Second step: compute score\nscore = 0\ncharacter :: current_char, my_char\ndo i = 1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n   current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n   if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n      my_char = 'g'\n   else\n      my_char = 'p'\n   end if\n   if (my_char /= current_char) then\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n         score = score + 1\n      else\n         score = score - 1\n      end if\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variable declarations must be at the beginning of a block. So inside the do loop, you can't declare variables. So the correct way is to declare current_char and my_char before the loop.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\n! Second step: compute score\nscore = 0\ncharacter :: current_char, my_char\ndo i = 1, len_trim(intermediate_str)\n   current_char = intermediate_str(i:i)\n   if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n      my_char = 'g'\n   else\n      my_char = 'p'\n   end if\n   if (my_char /= current_char) then\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n         score = score + 1\n      else\n         score = score - 1\n      end if\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the variables current_char and my_char are declared in the same scope as the loop. So that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the variables current_char and my_char are declared after the score =0 line, but before the loop. That's allowed in Fortran 90 and later.\n\nYes, in Fortran 90, variables can be declared anywhere in the scope, not just at the top. So that's okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"AB\"\n\nFirst step: contains A and B \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nSecond step: process \"Yes\".\n\nCharacters: 'Y', 'e', 's'\n\nIndices (Fortran 1-based):\n\ni=1 (Java i=0 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'):\n\ncurrent_char is 'Y' vs 'g' \u2192 different. my_char is 'g', so subtract 1 \u2192 score = -1.\n\ni=2 (Java i=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 'p'):\n\ncurrent_char 'e' vs 'p' \u2192 different. my_char is 'p', so add 1 \u2192 score becomes 0.\n\ni=3 (Java i=2 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'):\n\ncurrent_char 's' vs 'g' \u2192 different. subtract 1 \u2192 score = -1.\n\nSo total score is -1.\n\nThird step: the string is \"-1\", no commas \u2192 output \"-1\".\n\nSo the final output is \"-1\".\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: \"A\" (no B). First step outputs \"No\".\n\nSecond step processes \"No\".\n\nCharacters: 'N', 'o' (len=2).\n\ni=1 (Java 0 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'):\n\n'N' vs 'g' \u2192 different. subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\ni=2 (Java 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 'p'):\n\n'o' vs 'p' \u2192 different. add 1 \u2192 total 0.\n\nSo score is 0 \u2192 output \"0\".\n\nThird step: \"0\" \u2192 no commas \u2192 output \"0\".\n\nAnother test case where the second step's output has a comma. Suppose the first step outputs \"A,B\" (but that's impossible because first step's output is only \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second step's input can't have commas. So the third step's processing is redundant, but the code still does it.\n\nWait, the first step's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second step's input has no commas. So the third step's processing will leave the string as is. So the final output is the same as the second step's output.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the print statement uses print *, trim(result_str). The trim is important because the result_str may have trailing spaces from the initial assignment (since it's a fixed-length variable). For example, if the score is 123, then score_str is \"123\", but if the variable is length 20, then the rest are spaces. The trim removes those.\n\nAlternatively, using write(*, '(A)') trim(result_str) might be better to avoid any extra spaces.\n\nWait, the print *, statement automatically trims trailing spaces. Because in Fortran, when you print a character variable with *, it prints until the first blank. Wait, no, actually, the * format specifier for character variables will print the entire string, including trailing blanks. Wait, no, the * in format means \"list-directed\", which for character variables, prints the entire string, including trailing blanks unless the variable is a character array with a length. Wait, perhaps better to use an explicit format.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that only the actual content is printed, use:\n\nprint '(A)', trim(result_str)\n\nThis way, the trim ensures that any trailing spaces from the initial assignment are removed.\n\nSo modifying the print statement:\n\nprint '(A)', trim(result_str)\n\nThat's better.\n\nSo the final code would have that.\n\nAnother thing: in the first step, when setting intermediate_str to 'Yes' or 'No', the rest of the characters are spaces. But when we process the second step, the loop uses len_trim(intermediate_str), so it only processes the 'Yes' or 'No' part, which is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together with the corrections:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=1000) :: input_str, intermediate_str, score_str, result_str\n  integer :: score, i\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  !
