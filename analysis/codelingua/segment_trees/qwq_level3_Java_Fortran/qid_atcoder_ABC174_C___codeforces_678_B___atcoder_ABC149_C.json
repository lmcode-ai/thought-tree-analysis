    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K from input. It checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returning -1 if so. Then, if divisible by 7, it divides K by 7 and multiplies by 9. The main part calculates the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K == 1. The output is this ans or -1.\n\nThe second file (codeforces_678_B) takes the output from the first (which is the input here?), but wait, no. Wait, the original setup is that each program's output is the next's input. Wait, the user said the sequence is executed in order, with each program's output as the next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's output.\n\nWait, but the user wants a single Fortran program that does all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, the last producing output, and the intermediates processing without I/O. So the first Java program's input is the user's input, then its output is the input to the second Java program, which processes it and outputs to the third, which then outputs the final result.\n\nSo in the Fortran program, I need to:\n\n1. Read the initial input (for the first Java program's K).\n2. Compute the first program's result (solve() function's return value).\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program's y variable (since the second Java program's input is a year, which comes from the first's output).\n4. Compute the second program's result (the year found).\n5. Use that result as the input to the third program's x (since the third Java program takes an integer x as input).\n6. Compute the third program's result (the next prime or something? Wait, the third program's code is a bit more involved. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, the third Java program's code: it reads an integer x, then if x is not 2 and even, it increments to the next odd. Then it loops, checking if x is prime. If not, increments by 2 until it finds a prime. Then outputs that x. Wait, but the problem might be different. Wait, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe code starts with x = input. If x is not 2 and even, it adds 1 (so x becomes odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until it finds a prime. The code increments x by 2 each time it's not prime. So the output is the next prime number greater than or equal to x, but with some conditions. Wait, but the code's logic might have some issues. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    int i;\n    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n    for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n        if (x % i == 0) break;\n    }\n    if (i > sqrtNum) break; // if no divisors found, it's prime\n    x += 2; // else, not prime, so try next odd\n}\nSo the code is looking for the next prime number starting from x (if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1). So the output is the smallest prime >= x, except if x is even and not 2, then it starts at x+1. Wait, but if x is 2, it's allowed. So the third program's output is the next prime number starting from x (with adjustments for evenness).\n\nSo the third program's input is the output of the second program. The second program's output is the first year after the input year where the total days from the input year to that year is a multiple of 7, and the leap status matches the original year's.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must chain these three steps without I/O in between. So the first step's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final output is the third's result.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read the initial input (for the first program's K).\n- Compute the first program's result (call it result1).\n- Use result1 as the input to the second program's y variable.\n- Compute the second program's result (result2).\n- Use result2 as the input to the third program's x variable.\n- Compute the third program's result (result3).\n- Output result3.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst, translating the first Java program (atcoder_ABC174_C):\n\nThe solve() function:\n\nParameters: K is the input integer.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. If K is even or divisible by 5, return -1.\n\n2. If K is divisible by 7, divide K by 7, then multiply by 9. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7; then K *=9.\n\nWait, so K is modified here. So after dividing by 7, multiply by 9. So K becomes (K/7)*9.\n\nWait, but why? Let me see the code again:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, so after checking divisibility by 2 or 5, if so return -1. Then check if divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Then compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nWait, but why the division by 7 and multiply by 9? Let me think. The problem might be related to finding the minimal n where 10^n \u2261 1 mod K. But perhaps the original problem had some constraints. Maybe the code is solving for the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, but with some adjustments.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic is as written. So in Fortran, I need to replicate that.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read K from input (the first program's input is the user's input).\n\nCheck if K mod 2 ==0 or mod5 ==0 \u2192 return -1.\n\nElse, check if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 divide K by7, then multiply by9.\n\nWait, but the code does K /=7, then K *=9. So K becomes (K/7)*9.\n\nWait, but why? Let me see the code again. The code is:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nSo the K is first divided by 7 (if divisible by7), then multiplied by9.\n\nSo the new K is (original K divided by7) *9, but only if original K was divisible by7.\n\nWait, but why? Maybe the problem requires that. Let's not question the code, just translate it.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead K.\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then \u2192 result1 = -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then K = K /7\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nthen compute ans.\n\nThe ans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nLoop while remainder \u22601:\n\nans +=1, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nOnce remainder is 1, return ans.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, mod(a,b) is different from Java's % operator. Because in Java, the remainder can be negative, but in Fortran mod(a,b) is always non-negative. But since K is positive (since it's input as integer, but in Java, but in the code, K is read as an integer, but the problem might have constraints. But assuming K is positive here.\n\nSo the code's logic is okay.\n\nNow, the second Java program (codeforces_678_B):\n\nThe input is a year y (the output from first program's solve function, which is either -1 or some number. Wait, but the first program's output is the result of solve(). But if the first program returns -1, then the second program would get that as input, but the second program expects a year. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. But if the first program returns -1, then the second program would read that as y, but the second program is expecting a year. So perhaps in the original problem, the first program's output is only valid when it's not -1, but the user's input to the first program must be such that K is not divisible by 2 or 5. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so we have to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as an integer (y = in.nextInt();). So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would read that as y, and proceed. Let's see what happens in the second program's code.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int y = in.nextInt();\n    boolean leap = check_leap(y);\n    int sum = 0;\n    int mod = 0;\n    for (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n        if (check_leap(i)) {\n            sum += 366;\n        } else {\n            sum += 365;\n        }\n        if (sum %7 ==0) {\n            if ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)) {\n                System.out.println(i);\n                return;\n            } else {\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the loop starts at i = y+1, and for each i, adds days (366 if leap, else 365) to sum. Then checks if sum mod7 is 0. If so, checks if the leap status of i matches the original y's leap status. If so, output i and exit.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (sum %7 ==0) \u2192 then check if (leap of i is same as leap of y). If yes, then return i.\n\nWait, the code's logic is to find the first year after y where the total days from y to that year (exclusive?) is a multiple of 7, and the leap status of that year matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the sum is the total days from y+1 up to i? Or from y to i?\n\nWait, the loop starts at i = y+1, and for each i, adds the days of that year (i) to the sum. So sum is the total days from y+1 to i (since i starts at y+1, first iteration adds days of y+1, then next adds days of y+2, etc. So the sum is cumulative. The loop is looking for the first i where the sum (total days from y+1 to i) is divisible by 7, and the leap status of i matches that of y.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (sum mod7 ==0) \u2192 then check if leap of i is same as leap of y. If so, return i.\n\nWait, but the sum is the total days from y+1 up to i. So the total days between y and i is (sum) plus the days of y? Not sure, but the code is as written.\n\nSo in the case where the first program's output is -1, then the second program's input y is -1, which is invalid as a year. But the problem says to translate the sequence as given, so we have to handle that. The second program would proceed with y = -1, but check_leap(-1) would return false (since 400 doesn't divide -1, etc.), and then the loop starts at i =0. But the code may not handle that, but since the user wants the exact behavior, we have to replicate it.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second program's input is the first's output (result1). So in the Fortran code, after computing result1, we pass it to the second's processing.\n\nNow, the third program (atcoder_ABC149_C):\n\nThe input is an integer x (the output from the second program). The code reads x, then:\n\nif x is not 2 and even \u2192 x becomes x+1 (so it's odd).\n\nThen enters a loop to find the next prime number starting from x (or x+1 if even and not 2). The loop checks if x is prime. If not, increments by 2 and repeats.\n\nThe output is the first prime found.\n\nSo in Fortran, the third program's input is the second's output (result2). The code must process that to get result3.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will have variables for each step's output.\n\nFirst, read the initial K (from user input).\n\nCompute result1 (the first program's output).\n\nThen, use result1 as the input to the second program's y.\n\nCompute result2 (the second program's output).\n\nThen, use result2 as the input to the third program's x.\n\nCompute result3 (third's output).\n\nFinally, print result3.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (first Java program's solve function):\n\nFunction to compute result1:\n\nsubroutine compute_result1(K, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: K\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    integer :: tempK, remainder, ans\n    if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n        result = -1\n        return\n    end if\n    tempK = K\n    if (mod(tempK,7) ==0) then\n        tempK = tempK /7\n    end if\n    tempK = tempK *9\n    ans =1\n    remainder = mod(10, tempK)\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n        ans = ans +1\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, tempK)\n    end do\n    result = ans\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by7, multiply by9. So the tempK is K divided by7 (if divisible by7), then multiplied by9. So the code above does that.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nK is read.\n\nif divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7.\n\nthen K *=9.\n\nthen compute ans.\n\nSo in the code above, tempK is initialized as K, then divided by7 if needed, then multiplied by9. So that's correct.\n\nSecond part (second Java program's logic):\n\nThe second program's input is y (result1). The code needs to compute the first year after y where the sum of days from y+1 to i is divisible by7, and the leap status of i matches that of y.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine compute_result2(y, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    logical :: leap_y, leap_i\n    integer :: i, sum_days\n    leap_y = check_leap(y)\n    sum_days =0\n    i = y +1\n    do\n        leap_i = check_leap(i)\n        if (leap_i) then\n            sum_days = sum_days +366\n        else\n            sum_days = sum_days +365\n        end if\n        if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n            if ( (leap_i .eqv. leap_y) ) then\n                result = i\n                return\n            end if\n        end if\n        i = i +1\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but the loop is infinite until it finds the correct i. So in Fortran, the loop must continue until the condition is met. The code above uses a do loop with no exit until the return.\n\nThe check_leap function:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n        check_leap = .true.\n    else if (mod(y,4) ==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0) then\n        check_leap = .true.\n    else\n        check_leap = .false.\n    end if\nend function\n\nThird part (third Java program's logic):\n\nThe third program's input is x (result2). The code must find the next prime starting from x (with adjustments for evenness).\n\nsubroutine compute_result3(x, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    integer :: current_x, i, sqrt_num\n    current_x = x\n    if (current_x /=2 .and. mod(current_x,2) ==0) then\n        current_x = current_x +1\n    end if\n    do\n        sqrt_num = nint(sqrt(real(current_x)))\n        do i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n            if (mod(current_x, i) ==0) then\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (i > sqrt_num) then\n            result = current_x\n            return\n        else\n            current_x = current_x +2\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop is while (true), and the inner loop checks for divisors. The code in Java uses a for loop starting at 3, stepping by 2, up to sqrt(x). The variable i is initialized each time. If any divisor is found (i.e., x mod i ==0), then break the loop. Then, after the loop, if i exceeds sqrt_num, then it's prime. Else, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nIn Fortran, the inner loop can be written as:\n\ndo i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n    if (mod(current_x, i) ==0) then\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, check if i > sqrt_num. If yes, then it's prime. Else, not.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, after the loop, the variable i will be the next value after the last iteration. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the loop runs from 3 to sqrt_num step 2. The loop variable i increments by 2 each time. The loop runs until i exceeds sqrt_num. So after the loop, i will be sqrt_num +2 (if sqrt_num was even?), but not sure. Wait, in Fortran, the loop variable is incremented each time. So after the loop, i will be the value after the last iteration. For example, if the loop runs from 3 to 5 (step 2), then i will be 3, then 5, then exit. The next i would be 7, but since 7>5, the loop stops. So after the loop, i is 7 (but that's beyond the limit). Wait, no. The loop condition is up to sqrt_num. So the loop runs while i <= sqrt_num. So after the loop, i is sqrt_num +2 (if step is 2). So in the code, after the loop, if the exit was due to mod(current_x, i) ==0, then i would have been the divisor. But in the case where no divisors were found, the loop would have run all the way to sqrt_num, and then i would be sqrt_num +2 (since the step is 2). Wait, but in that case, the loop would have ended when i exceeds sqrt_num. So the final i would be sqrt_num +2 (if the last i was sqrt_num, then next step is adding 2, which is over).\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, after the loop, the variable i is left at the last value it had during the loop. So if the loop ran up to sqrt_num, then the last i is sqrt_num (if sqrt_num is odd). So after the loop, i would be sqrt_num +2 (if step is 2). Hmm, this is a problem because in the code, after the loop, the check is whether i > sqrt_num. So in Fortran, after the loop, the i is the value after the last iteration. Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose sqrt_num is 5 (so sqrt(x) is 5.0, so nint gives 5). The loop runs i from 3 to 5 step 2:\n\ni=3 \u2192 check mod(current_x,3). If not divisible, proceed.\n\ni=5 \u2192 check mod(current_x,5). If not divisible, loop ends.\n\nAfter the loop, i is 5 (the last value) plus step (2) \u2192 7? Or does the loop variable stop at 5?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo i = start, end, step\n\nThe loop runs for i=start, start+step, etc., up to the maximum <= end.\n\nSo for end=5, step=2, start=3:\n\ni=3 \u2192 first iteration.\n\ni=5 \u2192 second iteration (3+2=5).\n\nThen next would be 7, which is >5 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nSo after the loop, i is 5 (the last value) plus step (2) \u2192 7? Or is i left at 5?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variable is incremented each time, but after the loop, the variable's value is the last value it had during the loop. So after the loop, i would be 5 in this case. Because the loop runs for i=3 and 5. The next i would be 7, which is beyond the end, so the loop stops. So the variable i is left at 5.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of a simple example:\n\ninteger :: i\n\ndo i = 3,5,2\n\nprint *,i\n\nend do\n\nprint *,i\n\nThe output would be 3,5, then after the loop, the print would be 5 +2 =7? Or 5?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variable is incremented each time. The loop runs while i <= end. So after the loop, the variable is set to end + step. Because the loop exits when i exceeds end. So in the example above, after the loop, i would be 7.\n\nWait, let me test this mentally:\n\nFirst iteration: i=3 \u2192 print 3.\n\nSecond iteration: i=5 \u2192 print5.\n\nThen, i is increased by step (2) \u2192 7. Now, 7>5 \u2192 loop exits.\n\nSo the loop variable i is now 7. So the final print would be 7.\n\nAh, right. So after the loop, the variable i is set to end + step. So in the example, after the loop, i is 7.\n\nTherefore, in the code for the third program's inner loop:\n\nAfter the loop, i will be sqrt_num +2 (if step is 2). So the check is whether i > sqrt_num. Since sqrt_num is the integer part (nint(sqrt(x))), then sqrt_num +2 is definitely greater than sqrt_num. So the condition (i > sqrt_num) is always true if the loop completed without exiting early (i.e., no divisors found).\n\nWait, but in the case where the loop found a divisor, then the exit is triggered by the exit statement. So in that case, the loop would have exited early, and i would be the value where the divisor was found. So the check after the loop is whether i > sqrt_num.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose current_x is 9 (not prime). The sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt_num is 3.\n\nLoop runs i from 3 to 3 (step 2). So i=3.\n\nCheck mod(9,3) \u2192 0 \u2192 exit the loop.\n\nSo after the loop, i is 3 (since the loop didn't proceed further). Then, the check is if i > sqrt_num (3). 3 is not greater than 3 \u2192 so the condition is false \u2192 so it's not a prime, so increment current_x by 2 (to 11), and loop again.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code would proceed to increment current_x to 11, then check again.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is:\n\ndo i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n\n    if (mod(current_x, i) ==0) then\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, check if i > sqrt_num.\n\nIn the case of 9, the loop exits at i=3 (since mod(9,3)=0). So after the loop, i is 3. sqrt_num is 3. So i is not greater than sqrt_num \u2192 so the code goes to else, increments current_x by 2 (to 11).\n\nNow, for current_x=11:\n\nsqrt_num is 3 (since sqrt(11) is ~3.316, nint gives 3).\n\nLoop runs i from 3 to 3 (step 2). i=3.\n\nmod(11,3) is 2 \u2192 not zero \u2192 loop continues. After the loop, i becomes 5 (since step is 2, next i is 3+2=5, which is >3 \u2192 loop stops. So after the loop, i is 5.\n\nThen, check if i>3 \u2192 yes. So it's a prime \u2192 return 11.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code for the third subroutine:\n\nThe check after the loop is if (i > sqrt_num). So in code:\n\nafter the inner loop:\n\nif (i > sqrt_num) then \u2192 it's prime.\n\nElse \u2192 not.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nNow, putting all together in a single Fortran program.\n\nThe main program will:\n\n1. Read the initial K (from user input).\n\n2. Compute result1 via the first subroutine.\n\n3. If result1 is -1, then the second subroutine's input is -1, which may lead to an infinite loop? But the problem requires exact behavior, so we have to proceed.\n\n4. Compute result2 via the second subroutine.\n\n5. Compute result3 via the third subroutine.\n\n6. Print result3.\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to handle the variables properly.\n\nNow, the problem is that the second subroutine (compute_result2) has an infinite loop. In Fortran, how to handle that?\n\nWait, in the second Java program's code, the loop is infinite until it finds the correct i. So in Fortran, the subroutine compute_result2 must loop until it finds the correct i. So the do loop in the subroutine is an infinite loop (do ... end do without a condition), and exits via return when the condition is met.\n\nYes, that's how it's written above.\n\nNow, the main program structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: K, result1, result2, result3\n    read(*,*) K\n    call compute_result1(K, result1)\n    call compute_result2(result1, result2)\n    call compute_result3(result2, result3)\n    write(*,*) result3\ncontains\n    subroutine compute_result1(K, result)\n        ! ... as above\n    end subroutine\n    subroutine compute_result2(y, result)\n        ! ... as above\n    end subroutine\n    logical function check_leap(y)\n        ! ... as above\n    end function\n    subroutine compute_result3(x, result)\n        ! ... as above\n    end subroutine\nend program\n\nWait, but in the second subroutine, the check_leap function is needed. So the check_leap function must be accessible. Since it's in a contained program, the function can be placed in the contains section.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the compute_result1 subroutine:\n\nsubroutine compute_result1(K, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: K\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    integer :: tempK, remainder, ans\n    if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n        result = -1\n        return\n    end if\n    tempK = K\n    if (mod(tempK,7) ==0) then\n        tempK = tempK /7\n    end if\n    tempK = tempK *9\n    ans =1\n    remainder = mod(10, tempK)\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n        ans = ans +1\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, tempK)\n    end do\n    result = ans\nend subroutine\n\nSecond, the check_leap function:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n        check_leap = .true.\n    else if (mod(y,4) ==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0) then\n        check_leap = .true.\n    else\n        check_leap = .false.\n    end if\nend function\n\nThird, compute_result2:\n\nsubroutine compute_result2(y, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    logical :: leap_y, leap_i\n    integer :: i, sum_days\n    leap_y = check_leap(y)\n    sum_days =0\n    i = y +1\n    do\n        leap_i = check_leap(i)\n        if (leap_i) then\n            sum_days = sum_days +366\n        else\n            sum_days = sum_days +365\n        end if\n        if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n            if ( (leap_i .eqv. leap_y) ) then\n                result = i\n                return\n            end if\n        end if\n        i = i +1\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nFourth, compute_result3:\n\nsubroutine compute_result3(x, result)\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer, intent(out) :: result\n    integer :: current_x, i, sqrt_num\n    current_x = x\n    if (current_x /=2 .and. mod(current_x,2) ==0) then\n        current_x = current_x +1\n    end if\n    do\n        sqrt_num = nint(sqrt(real(current_x)))\n        do i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n            if (mod(current_x, i) ==0) then\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (i > sqrt_num) then\n            result = current_x\n            return\n        else\n            current_x = current_x +2\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nNow, putting all together in the main program.\n\nWait, but in the third subroutine, the sqrt_num is calculated as nint(sqrt(real(current_x))). Since current_x can be large, but in Fortran, the sqrt function for integers may need to be handled with real numbers. So converting to real is okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: First program's input K=7 (divisible by7).\n\nThen:\n\ntempK =7/7=1 \u2192 multiply by9 \u2192 9.\n\nans starts at1, remainder=10 mod9 \u21921.\n\nSo remainder is 1 \u2192 loop doesn't execute. So ans is 1. So result1=1.\n\nThen second program's input is 1 (y=1).\n\nCompute leap_y: check_leap(1). 1 mod400 is 1 \u2192 not divisible by400. mod4 is 1, mod100 is 1 \u2192 so yes, it's a leap year (since 1 mod4 ==1? Wait, 1 mod4 is 1, so 1 mod4 ==0? No. Wait 1 divided by4 is 0 with remainder1. So mod4 is 1. So the condition (mod(y,4)==0 and mod(y,100)/=0) is false. So leap_y is false.\n\nThen the loop starts at i=2.\n\nsum_days starts at0.\n\ni=2:\n\nleap_i = check_leap(2). 2 mod4 is 2 \u2192 no. So not leap. sum_days +=365 \u2192 365.\n\nCheck mod(365,7) \u2192 365 /7 is 52*7=364 \u2192 remainder1 \u2192 365 mod7 is 1 \u2192 not 0. So continue.\n\ni=3:\n\nsum +=365 (non-leap). sum is 730 \u2192 mod7 is 0 (since 365 mod7 is 1, so 365*2 mod7 is 2 \u2192 no. Wait 365 mod7: 7*52=364 \u2192 365 mod7 is 1. So 365+365=730 mod7 is 2 \u2192 not 0. Hmm, maybe I need to compute step by step.\n\nWait let's track:\n\ni=2:\n\nsum_days =365 \u2192 mod7 is 1 \u2192 not 0.\n\ni=3:\n\nsum +=365 \u2192 total 730 \u2192 mod7: 730 /7 is 104*7=728 \u2192 remainder2 \u2192 mod7 is 2 \u2192 not 0.\n\ni=4:\n\nsum +=366? Wait, check_leap(4):\n\n4 mod4 is0, mod100 is4 \u2192 so yes, leap. So add 366 \u2192 sum becomes 730+366=1096.\n\nmod(1096,7): 7*156=1092 \u2192 remainder4 \u2192 mod7 is4 \u2192 not 0.\n\ni=5:\n\nsum +=365 (non-leap). 1096+365=1461 \u2192 mod7: 1461 /7 \u2192 7*208=1456 \u2192 rem5 \u2192 mod7 5.\n\ni=6:\n\nsum +=365 \u2192 1461+365=1826 \u2192 mod7: 1826 mod7 \u2192 7*260=1820 \u2192 rem6 \u2192 mod7 6.\n\ni=7:\n\ncheck_leap(7): 7 mod4 is3 \u2192 no. So add 365 \u2192 sum 1826+365=2191 \u2192 mod7: 2191 mod7 \u2192 7*313=2191 \u2192 rem0 \u2192 mod7 is0.\n\nNow check leap_i (i=7 is not leap). leap_y (y=1 is not leap). So (leap_i == leap_y \u2192 true). So return i=7.\n\nThus, result2 is7.\n\nThen third program's input is7.\n\nThird program's code:\n\nx=7.\n\nCheck if x is even? 7 is odd. So current_x remains 7.\n\nCheck if prime:\n\nsqrt(7) is ~2.645 \u2192 nint gives 3.\n\nLoop i from3 to3 (step2). i=3.\n\nCheck mod(7,3)=1 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 loop continues. After loop, i becomes 5 (since 3+2=5>3 \u2192 loop ends).\n\nCheck if i>3 \u2192 yes. So it's prime \u2192 result3 is7.\n\nThus, the final output is7.\n\nSo the code should handle this case.\n\nAnother test case: first program's K=3 (not divisible by2,5,7).\n\nThen:\n\ntempK =3*9=27.\n\nans starts at1, remainder=10 mod27 \u219210.\n\nLoop:\n\nans=1 \u2192 remainder=10 mod27 \u219210 !=1.\n\nans=2 \u2192 remainder=10*10 mod27 \u2192100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 rem19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 19*10 mod27 \u2192190 mod27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 rem1 \u2192 190 mod27 is1.\n\nSo ans=3 \u2192 result1=3.\n\nSecond program's input is3 (y=3).\n\nleap_y: check_leap(3) \u2192 no.\n\nsum starts at0.\n\ni=4:\n\nleap_i: 4 mod4=0, mod100=4 \u2192 yes. So add366 \u2192 sum=366 mod7 \u2192 366 mod7: 7*52=364 \u2192 rem2 \u2192 not 0.\n\ni=5:\n\nsum +=365 \u2192 366+365=731 mod7 \u2192 731 mod7: 7*104=728 \u2192 rem3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=6: add365 \u2192 sum=1096 mod7 \u2192 1096 mod7: 7*156=1092 \u2192 rem4 \u2192 no.\n\ni=7: add365 \u2192 sum=1461 mod7 \u2192 1461 mod7 \u2192 1461-7*208=1461-1456=5 \u2192 rem5.\n\ni=8: leap (8 mod4=0, mod100=8 \u2192 yes). add366 \u2192 sum=1461+366=1827 mod7 \u2192 1827 mod7 \u2192 7*261=1827 \u2192 rem0.\n\nCheck leap_i (i=8 is leap). leap_y (y=3 is not). So (leap_i .eqv. leap_y \u2192 false \u2192 continue.\n\ni=9:\n\nsum +=365 \u2192 1827+365=2192 mod7 \u2192 2192 mod7 \u2192 2192-7*313=2192-2191=1 \u2192 rem1.\n\ni=10: add365 \u2192 sum=2192+365=2557 mod7 \u2192 2557 mod7 \u2192 7*365=2555 \u2192 rem2.\n\ni=11: add365 \u2192 2557+365=2922 mod7 \u2192 2922 mod7 \u2192 7*417=2919 \u2192 rem3.\n\ni=12: leap (12 mod4=0 \u2192 yes). add366 \u2192 sum=2922+366=3288 mod7 \u2192 3288 mod7 \u2192 7*469=3283 \u2192 rem5.\n\ni=13: add365 \u2192 3288+365=3653 mod7 \u2192 3653 mod7 \u2192 7*521=3647 \u2192 rem6.\n\ni=14: add365 \u2192 3653+365=4018 mod7 \u2192 4018 mod7 \u2192 7*574=4018 \u2192 rem0.\n\nCheck leap_i (14 mod4 is 2 \u2192 no). So leap_i is false. leap_y is false \u2192 match. So return i=14.\n\nThus, result2=14.\n\nThird program's input is14.\n\nx=14.\n\nCheck if x is even and not 2 \u2192 yes. So current_x becomes15.\n\nCheck if 15 is prime:\n\nsqrt(15) is ~3.87 \u2192 nint gives4.\n\nLoop i from3 to4 step2 \u2192 i=3, then 5 (but 5>4 \u2192 loop runs i=3.\n\nmod(15,3)=0 \u2192 exit loop. i=3.\n\nCheck if i>4 \u2192 3>4?

So result3=17.\n\nThus, the final output is17.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nThe final Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: K, result1, result2, result3\n    read(*,*) K\n    call compute_result1(K, result1)\n    call compute_result2(result1, result2)\n    call compute_result3(result2, result3)\n    write(*,*) result3\ncontains\n    subroutine compute_result1(K, result)\n        integer, intent(in) :: K\n        integer, intent(out) :: result\n        integer :: tempK, remainder, ans\n        if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n            result = -1\n            return\n        end if\n        tempK = K\n        if (mod(tempK,7) ==0) then\n            tempK = tempK /7\n        end if\n        tempK = tempK *9\n        ans =1\n        remainder = mod(10, tempK)\n        do while (remainder /=1)\n            ans = ans +1\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, tempK)\n        end do\n        result = ans\n    end subroutine compute_result1\n\n    logical function check_leap(y)\n        integer, intent(in) :: y\n        if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n            check_leap = .true.\n        else if (mod(y,4) ==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0) then\n            check_leap = .true.\n        else\n            check_leap = .false.\n        end if\n    end function check_leap\n\n    subroutine compute_result2(y, result)\n        integer, intent(in) :: y\n        integer, intent(out) :: result\n        logical :: leap_y, leap_i\n        integer :: i, sum_days\n        leap_y = check_leap(y)\n        sum_days =0\n        i = y +1\n        do\n            leap_i = check_leap(i)\n            if (leap_i) then\n                sum_days = sum_days +366\n            else\n                sum_days = sum_days +365\n            end if\n            if (mod(sum_days,7) ==0) then\n                if ( (leap_i .eqv. leap_y) ) then\n                    result = i\n                    return\n                end if\n            end if\n            i = i +1\n        end do\n    end subroutine compute_result2\n\n    subroutine compute_result3(x, result)\n        integer, intent(in) :: x\n        integer, intent(out) :: result\n        integer :: current_x, i, sqrt_num\n        current_x = x\n        if (current_x /=2 .and. mod(current_x,2) ==0) then\n            current_x = current_x +1\n        end if\n        do\n            sqrt_num = nint(sqrt(real(current_x)))\n            do i=3, sqrt_num, 2\n                if (mod(current_x, i) ==0) then\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (i > sqrt_num) then\n                result = current_x\n                return\n            else\n                current_x = current_x +2\n            end if\n        end do\n    end subroutine compute_result3\nend program main\n\nThis should be the correct translation."
