    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ARC086_B) reads input: an integer n followed by n integers. It processes them to generate a list of pairs (strings) which are then printed. The output here is the count of these pairs followed by each pair. The next program (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes that count as input, processes it, and outputs a number. The third program (atcoder_ABC174_C) takes that number and outputs another number. The key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next, so the Fortran program must chain these steps without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (from the first Java program's input), process all three steps in sequence, and then output the final result of the third program. The intermediate steps must not do any I/O.\n\nLet me break down each Java program's logic step by step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\n1. Read n and array a of n integers.\n2. Find the index m of the element with the largest absolute value. If there's a tie, it picks the last one? Wait, no, the loop is for i from 1 to n-1, so m starts at 0. For each i starting at 1, if the absolute value of a[i] is larger than a[m], m becomes i. So m is the index of the element with the maximum absolute value, breaking ties by choosing the last occurrence? Wait, no, because if multiple elements have the same maximum absolute value, the first one encountered (starting from 0) would be replaced only if a later element has a larger or equal? Wait, the condition is Math.abs(a[m]) < Math.abs(a[i]). So m is the index of the element with the maximum absolute value. If there are multiple elements with the same maximum absolute value, the last one (since we loop from 1 to n-1, so the first occurrence after m would replace m only if the absolute value is strictly larger. So m is the index of the element with the maximum absolute value, and in case of ties, the first occurrence? Wait no, because if two elements have the same absolute value, the first one (earlier in the array) would be m, and when the next one comes, since the absolute value is not larger, m stays. So m is the first occurrence of the maximum absolute value? Wait no, let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is [3,5,5]. The initial m is 0 (value 3). Then i=1: 5's absolute is larger than 3, so m becomes 1. Then i=2: 5's absolute is same as a[m], so no change. So m is 1. So the first occurrence of the maximum is not necessarily, but the first occurrence in the loop. Wait, the loop starts at i=1, so the first element (index 0) is considered first. So m is the index of the element with the maximum absolute value, and in case of ties, the last occurrence? Wait no, because when you have elements with the same absolute value, the first one encountered (earlier in the array) would be m, and subsequent ones with same absolute value won't replace m. So m is the first occurrence of the maximum absolute value? Wait no, let's see:\n\nSuppose array is [5,3,5]. The initial m is 0 (5). Then i=1: 3's absolute is less than 5, so m stays. i=2: 5's absolute is equal, so no change. So m remains 0. So the first occurrence is kept. So m is the first occurrence of the maximum absolute value. Wait, but if the array is [3,5,5], then m would be 1, since when i=1, the absolute is larger than the initial m (0's 3). So m is the first occurrence of the maximum. Wait, no, in that case, the first element is 3, then the second is 5 (so m becomes 1), then third is 5, which is same as a[m], so m stays at 1. So m is the first occurrence of the maximum. So the first occurrence of the maximum absolute value is chosen.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The first program's output is the number of pairs (the size of r) followed by each pair. The second program takes that number (the size) as input. So the first program's output is first the count, then the pairs. The second program reads that count as its input x, then processes it and outputs a number. The third program takes that number as K and outputs the result.\n\nWait, the second Java program (ABC149_C) reads x as the first input. So the first program's output is the count (the first line) which is the x for the second program. The rest of the lines (the pairs) are not used by the second program. So the second program only reads the first line (the count) of the first program's output, and ignores the rest. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first step must compute the count (the size of r) and pass that to the second step, which then processes it, and the third step takes the output of the second step.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part must compute the count (the size of r) from the input, then pass that to the second function, which computes the next value, then pass that to the third function, and finally output the result of the third function.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and array a from input.\n\n2. Compute m as the index of the element with maximum absolute value (breaking ties by first occurrence).\n\n3. Generate the list r of pairs as per the first Java program's logic. The size of r is the count that is the output of the first program, which is the input to the second program.\n\n4. The second program takes that count (x) and processes it to find the next prime or something (the code seems to find the next prime after x if it's even, but I need to see the code again).\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program (ABC149_C):\n\nThe code starts with x = input. Then, if x is not 2 and even, it increments x to the next odd. Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. The loop continues until it finds a prime. The code uses trial division up to sqrt(x). The output is the first prime >= x (but with some conditions). Wait, let me re-express the code:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 ==0) x++;\n\nSo if x is even and not 2, then x becomes x+1 (making it odd). Then, in the loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   for i from 3 to sqrt(x) step 2:\n\n      if x mod i ==0, break.\n\n   if after the loop, i exceeds sqrt(x), then break (so x is prime).\n\n   else, x +=2 (so next odd number).\n\n}\n\nSo the code is finding the smallest prime number >= x, but with some handling for even numbers. For example, if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1 (odd). Then, it checks if that is prime. If not, increments by 2 (next odd) and so on. So the output is the smallest prime >= x, except when x is 2, which is already prime. So the second program's output is the smallest prime >= x, where x is the count from the first program.\n\nThen the third program (ABC174_C) takes that prime number as K and computes some value. Let me look at the third Java code.\n\nThe third program's solve function:\n\nReads K as input. Then:\n\nif K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1.\n\nElse, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7.\n\nThen multiply K by 9.\n\nThen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans \u2261 1 mod K. The loop is:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder starts at 10 mod K.\n\nWhile remainder !=1, multiply remainder by 10 mod K, increment ans.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal positive integer ans such that 10^ans \u2261 1 mod K. But with some preconditions.\n\nWait, the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. Then, if K is divisible by 7, it divides by 7. Then multiplies by 9. Wait, why?\n\nWait the code:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires K to not be divisible by 2 or 5, so first check that. Then, if divisible by 7, divide by 7, then multiply by 9. Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal n such that 7 divides (10^n -1)/9, but I'm not sure. The code's logic is a bit unclear, but the Fortran code must replicate it.\n\nSo the third program's output is the minimal ans where 10^ans \u22611 mod (K *9 /7 if divisible by 7, else K*9?), but the code's steps are:\n\nAfter checking K is not divisible by 2 or 5, then if K mod7 ==0, divide by7, then multiply by9. So the new K is (K/7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9. Then the problem is to find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod (new K) ==1.\n\nWait, the code's K after division by7 (if applicable) is multiplied by9. So the modulus is K_new = (K /7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9. Then the code computes the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K_new ==1.\n\nWait, but the code's K is modified as follows:\n\nOriginal K is input. Then:\n\nif K mod7 ==0, then K becomes K/7. Then multiply by9. So the modulus is (K/7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nSo yes. So the modulus is K *9 divided by7 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nThe code then computes the minimal ans where (10^ans mod (K*9/(7^?))) ==1.\n\nThe code's remainder starts at 10 mod (K*9/(7^?)), then each step multiplies by 10 mod K_new, until it loops back to 1.\n\nSo the third program's output is the minimal ans for that.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must chain all three steps.\n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and array a from input.\n\n2. Compute m as the index of the element with maximum absolute value (first occurrence in case of ties).\n\n3. Compute the size of r (the count) as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n   The r list is built by:\n\n   For each i from 0 to n-1, if a[m] and a[i] have opposite signs (since a[m] >=0 XOR a[i] >=0), then add m+1 and i+1 as a pair. So the count is the number of such i's.\n\n   Then, depending on a[m] being non-negative or negative, add more pairs:\n\n   If a[m] >=0, then add pairs (i, i+1) for i from 1 to n-1 (so n-1 pairs). So total count is (number of opposite sign pairs) + (n-1).\n\n   Else (a[m] is negative), add pairs (i, i-1) for i from n down to 2 (so n-1 pairs again). So total count is (opposite sign count) + (n-1).\n\n   Wait, let me recheck the first Java code's code:\n\n   The code first adds all pairs where a[m] and a[i] have opposite signs. Then, if a[m] is non-negative, it adds steps from 1 to n-1 (connecting each consecutive pair). So the total count is the initial count plus (n-1). If a[m] is negative, it adds steps from n down to 2 (so again n-1 steps). So the total count is (initial count) + (n-1).\n\n   Wait, the code for the first part:\n\n   The first loop adds all i where a[m] and a[i] have opposite signs. So the initial count is the number of such i's.\n\n   Then, if a[m] >=0, the second loop adds (n-1) pairs (since from 1 to n-1, each step adds one pair). So total is initial + (n-1).\n\n   If a[m] is negative, the second loop adds (n-1) pairs (from n down to 2, so n-1 steps). So total is initial + (n-1).\n\n   So the total count is (number of opposite sign pairs) + (n-1).\n\n   Wait, but the code's first part is:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) if (a[m] >=0 ^ a[i] >=0) r.add(...)\n\n   So the number of such i's is the count of elements with opposite sign to a[m].\n\n   Then, the second part adds either n-1 pairs (the consecutive steps). So the total count is (opposite count) + (n-1).\n\n   So the count (the first output line of the first program) is (opposite count) + (n-1).\n\n   So to compute the count, I can calculate that without building the list.\n\n   So in Fortran, I can compute the count as:\n\n   count = (number of elements with opposite sign to a(m)) + (n-1)\n\n   So I don't need to store all the pairs, just compute the count.\n\n   That's important because the second program only needs the count, not the actual pairs.\n\n   So in the first step, the Fortran code can compute the count without building the list.\n\n   So steps for first part:\n\n   - Read n and array a (1-based or 0-based? In Java, arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based. Need to adjust indices.)\n\n   Let me think in Fortran terms:\n\n   Let's use 1-based arrays for a, since in Java the indices start at 0, but in Fortran, it's easier to start at 1.\n\n   So in Fortran:\n\n   Read n, then read n integers into an array a(1:n).\n\n   Find m as the index of the element with maximum absolute value. If multiple, first occurrence (since in Java, the loop starts at i=1, so m starts at 0 (Java's index 0 is Fortran's 1?), so in Fortran, the loop would start at i=2 (since m starts at 1 (Java's 0)), and compare with a(m). So the code for m would be:\n\n   m = 1\n\n   do i = 2, n\n\n      if (abs(a(i)) > abs(a(m))) then\n\n          m = i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   Then, compute the number of elements with opposite sign to a(m).\n\n   Let's call that 'opposite_count'.\n\n   opposite_count = 0\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      if ( (a(m) >=0) .neqv. (a(i) >=0) ) then\n\n          opposite_count = opposite_count +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   Then, the count is opposite_count + (n-1).\n\n   So that's the value that the second program will take as x.\n\n   So the first part's output is count = opposite_count + (n-1).\n\n   So the first part's result is count.\n\n   Now, the second part (Java's ABC149_C) takes x (count) and outputs the smallest prime >=x (with some handling for even numbers).\n\n   So in Fortran, the second function would take x and return the next prime.\n\n   The third part takes that prime (let's call it prime_x) and computes the solve function as per the third Java code.\n\n   So the third function takes K = prime_x, and returns the minimal ans.\n\n   Now, the Fortran program must:\n\n   1. Read n and a array.\n\n   2. Compute count as above.\n\n   3. Compute prime_x = next_prime(count).\n\n   4. Compute ans = solve(prime_x).\n\n   5. Output ans.\n\n   Now, implementing each part in Fortran.\n\n   Let's start with the first part (count):\n\n   The code for the first part is straightforward.\n\n   Now, the second part: function to compute the next prime.\n\n   The second Java code's logic:\n\n   The function takes x as input. If x is even and not 2, set x to x+1 (making it odd). Then, loop:\n\n   while true:\n\n      check if x is prime.\n\n      To check, iterate from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2.\n\n      If any divisor found, break and increment x by 2.\n\n      Else, return x.\n\n   So in Fortran, the function next_prime(x) would need to:\n\n   - Handle x=2: return 2.\n\n   - If x is even and not 2, set x = x+1.\n\n   Then, loop:\n\n      check if x is prime.\n\n      if yes, return x.\n\n      else, x +=2, and repeat.\n\n   The prime check function:\n\n   Function is_prime(n):\n\n      if n <=1: return .false.\n\n      if n ==2: return .true.\n\n      if even: return .false.\n\n      loop from 3 to sqrt(n), step 2.\n\n      if any divides n, return false.\n\n      else return true.\n\n   So in Fortran, the next_prime function can be written as a function.\n\n   Now, the third part: the solve function.\n\n   The third Java code's solve function:\n\n   Reads K, checks if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 returns -1.\n\n   Else, if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7.\n\n   Then K *=9.\n\n   Then find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\n   So in Fortran:\n\n   function solve(K) result(ans)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: K\n\n      integer :: ans, remainder, temp_K\n\n      if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n          ans = -1\n\n          return\n\n      end if\n\n      temp_K = K\n\n      if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n          temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n      end if\n\n      temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n      ans =1\n\n      remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n      do while (remainder /=1)\n\n          ans = ans +1\n\n          remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n      end do\n\n      ans = ans\n\n   end function\n\n   Wait, but in the code, the initial remainder is 10 mod temp_K. Then each step multiplies by 10 mod temp_K.\n\n   So the loop is:\n\n   remainder starts at 10 mod temp_K.\n\n   ans starts at 1.\n\n   while remainder !=1:\n\n      ans +=1\n\n      remainder = (remainder *10) mod temp_K\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Now, putting all together in Fortran.\n\n   The main program will:\n\n   Read n and array a.\n\n   Compute m, opposite_count, count.\n\n   Compute prime_x via next_prime(count).\n\n   Compute ans via solve(prime_x).\n\n   Print ans.\n\n   Now, the functions:\n\n   Let's structure the code.\n\n   First, the next_prime function.\n\n   Then, the solve function.\n\n   Now, in Fortran, functions can be written as internal or external. Since it's a single program, perhaps using modules, but for simplicity, we can write them as functions inside the main program.\n\n   Alternatively, write them as subroutines or functions.\n\n   Let me outline the code structure.\n\n   Program main\n\n      implicit none\n\n      integer :: n, a(100000) ! Assuming n can be up to 1e5, but need to check constraints. But in Java code, the first program uses an array of size n, so in Fortran, we can use dynamic arrays, but since Fortran 90+ allows allocatable arrays.\n\n      Wait, but in the problem statement, the user hasn't specified constraints. But for code submission, perhaps the array can be read with a reasonable size. Alternatively, use dynamic allocation.\n\n      Wait, in the first Java code, the array is size n, which can be up to 1e5 or so. So in Fortran, perhaps read n first, then allocate the array.\n\n      So:\n\n      integer :: n, m, opposite_count, count, prime_x, ans\n\n      integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      allocate(a(n))\n\n      read(*,*) a(1:n)\n\n      ! compute m\n\n      m = 1\n\n      do i = 2, n\n\n          if (abs(a(i)) > abs(a(m))) then\n\n              m = i\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      ! compute opposite_count\n\n      opposite_count =0\n\n      do i =1, n\n\n          if ( (a(m) >=0) .neqv. (a(i) >=0) ) then\n\n              opposite_count = opposite_count +1\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\n      count = opposite_count + (n-1)\n\n      ! compute prime_x = next_prime(count)\n\n      prime_x = next_prime(count)\n\n      ! compute ans = solve(prime_x)\n\n      ans = solve(prime_x)\n\n      print*, ans\n\n   contains\n\n      function next_prime(x) result(p)\n\n          integer, intent(in) :: x\n\n          integer :: p, i, sqrt_x, temp_x\n\n          temp_x = x\n\n          if (temp_x ==2) then\n\n              p =2\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          if (mod(temp_x,2) ==0) then\n\n              temp_x = temp_x +1\n\n          end if\n\n          do\n\n              p = temp_x\n\n              if (is_prime(p)) then\n\n                  exit\n\n              else\n\n                  temp_x = temp_x +2\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n      end function\n\n      function is_prime(n) result(res)\n\n          integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n          logical :: res\n\n          integer :: i, sqrt_n\n\n          if (n <=1) then\n\n              res = .false.\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          if (n ==2) then\n\n              res = .true.\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          if (mod(n,2) ==0) then\n\n              res = .false.\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n)))\n\n          do i=3, sqrt_n, 2\n\n              if (mod(n,i) ==0) then\n\n                  res = .false.\n\n                  return\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n          res = .true.\n\n      end function\n\n      function solve(K) result(ans)\n\n          integer, intent(in) :: K\n\n          integer :: ans, remainder, temp_K\n\n          if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n              ans = -1\n\n              return\n\n          end if\n\n          temp_K = K\n\n          if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n              temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n          end if\n\n          temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n          ans =1\n\n          remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n          do while (remainder /=1)\n\n              ans = ans +1\n\n              remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n          end do\n\n          ans = ans\n\n      end function\n\n   end program\n\n   Wait, but in the next_prime function, the loop is a do-while? Or in Fortran, the loop is written as a do loop with exit.\n\n   The next_prime function's code:\n\n   The function starts with temp_x = x, then if even and not 2, set to x+1.\n\n   Then enters a loop where it checks if temp_x is prime. If yes, returns it. Else, increments by 2 and repeats.\n\n   So the code in the function:\n\n   temp_x is initialized as x, but adjusted for evenness.\n\n   Then, the loop is:\n\n   do\n\n      p = temp_x\n\n      if (is_prime(p)) then\n\n          exit\n\n      else\n\n          temp_x = temp_x +2\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   So this loop continues until a prime is found.\n\n   That should work.\n\n   Now, testing edge cases.\n\n   For example, if the first program's count is 2, then the second program would process it. Let's see:\n\n   Suppose count is 2. The second program would check if 2 is even and not 2 \u2192 no. So temp_x remains 2. Then is_prime(2) is true, so returns 2. Then the third program takes K=2.\n\n   The third program checks if K is even \u2192 yes, so returns -1. So the final output is -1.\n\n   Another test case: if the first program's count is 3 (odd). The second program would check if 3 is prime \u2192 yes, so returns 3. Then third program takes K=3.\n\n   Check if 3 is even or divisible by5 \u2192 no. Then check if divisible by7 \u2192 no. So temp_K =3*9=27.\n\n   Now, find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod27 =1.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n   10 mod27 =10 \u2192 ans=1 \u2192 10 mod27=10\u22601.\n\n   ans=2 \u2192 100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 19.\n\n   ans=3 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 so ans=3.\n\n   So the third function would return 3. So the final output is 3.\n\n   So the code should handle that.\n\n   Now, possible issues:\n\n   - The array size in Fortran. Since in the first Java code, n can be up to 1e5, but in Fortran, using allocatable arrays is better. The code above uses allocate(a(n)), which is correct.\n\n   - The m calculation: in Java, the loop starts at i=1 (Java's index 1 is Fortran's 2?), but in the code above, m starts at 1 (Fortran's first element), and loops from 2 to n. That's correct.\n\n   - The opposite_count: the condition (a(m)>=0) .neqv. (a(i)>=0) is correct.\n\n   - The count is opposite_count + (n-1). That's correct.\n\n   Now, the next_prime function's initial handling of x=2 is correct.\n\n   The solve function's handling of K divisible by7: yes.\n\n   Now, in the solve function, when K is divisible by7, it divides by7, then multiplies by9. So temp_K is (K/7)*9.\n\n   The loop in solve is correct.\n\n   Now, in the code, the solve function returns ans, which is correct.\n\n   So putting all together, the Fortran code should work.\n\n   Now, some possible optimizations:\n\n   The next_prime function could be optimized, but for the problem's constraints, it's probably okay.\n\n   Also, in the is_prime function, the sqrt_n is calculated as int(sqrt(real(n))). That's okay.\n\n   Now, the code should be written with proper syntax.\n\n   Also, in the solve function, when K is divisible by7, we divide by7 once, even if divisible multiple times? The code says if mod(temp_K,7) ==0 \u2192 divide once. So if K was 49 (7^2), then temp_K becomes 7, then multiplied by9 \u2192 63. So the code is correct as per the Java code.\n\n   The Java code's code for the third program:\n\n   if (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\n   So it divides by7 once, even if divisible multiple times. So the Fortran code does the same.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   Now, the final code in Fortran."
