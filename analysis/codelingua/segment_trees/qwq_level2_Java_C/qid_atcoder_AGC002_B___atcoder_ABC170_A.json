The move is x=1 (Java's input is 1, so x becomes 0?), wait wait, the Java code reads x and y, subtracts 1.

So:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *input_copy = malloc(strlen(input_str)+1);\nstrcpy(input_copy, input_str);\n// process with strtok on input_copy\nfree(input_copy);\n\nAlternatively, since the original input_str is a modifiable array (since it's a local array), we can just use strtok on input_str directly, but strtok modifies the string. Since input_str is a local array, that's okay. Wait, in the code above, the input_str is a local array. So instead of making a copy, we can do:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\nint second_result =0;\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    second_result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") ==0) break;\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n} This way, we don't need to use strdup and free. Because we can modify the input_str directly. Since it's a local array, that's okay. This would be better, avoiding dynamic memory allocation. So modifying the code:\n\n// After computing counter:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\nint second_result =0;\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    second_result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") ==0) break;\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\n\nThis is better and avoids memory issues. So the final code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int num;\n    int red;\n} Box;\n\nvoid move(Box *src, Box *dst) { if (src->num == 0) return;\n    else if (src->num == 1) {\n        src->num = 0;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n        src->red = 0;\n    } else {\n        src->num--;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    Box B[N];\n    B[0].num = 1;\n    B[0].red = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n        B[i].num = 1;\n        B[i].red = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int x, y;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &x, &y);\n        x--;\n        y--;\n        move(&B[x], &B[y]);\n    }\n\n    int counter = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        if (B[i].red) counter++;\n    }\n\n    char input_str[20];\n    sprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\n    char *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\n    int second_result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        second_result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) break;\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", second_result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work. Let me check the move function again for the case when moving to the same box. Test case where x and y are the same (e.g., moving from box0 to box0):\n\nSuppose N=1, M=1, and the move is 1 1 (so x=0, y=0). The move function is called with src and dst being the same Box. Original state: num=1, red=1. Processing:\n\nsrc->num is 1 \u2192 enter the first else if. Set src->num to 0.",

Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_AGC002_B. It reads N and M from input. Then it initializes an array of Box objects. The first box has 1 ball and is red. The others start with 1 but not red. Then for M operations, it moves the ball from x to y. The move logic is a bit tricky. The Box's moveTo method: if the current box has 1 ball, moving it to another box transfers the ball, including the red status. If there are more than 1, it just moves one, but the red status might stay? Wait, the code says when moving from a box with num>1, the other box gets a ball, and if the original was red, the new one's red is set to true. But the original's red remains? Hmm, maybe the red flag is only set when the ball is moved. Wait, the Box's red is a boolean indicating if the red ball is present. So when moving, if the current box has the red and it's moving a ball, then the destination's red is set to true. But the original's red is only set to false if it's the last ball (when num was 1). Otherwise, if moving one of multiple, the original's red stays? Wait, let me recheck the code:\n\nIn the Box's moveTo method:\n\nIf num is 1:\n- set num to 0, so this box no longer has the ball.\n- other's num increases by 1.\n- if red was true, set other's red to true.\n- set this box's red to false.\n\nElse (num >1):\n- decrease num by 1, other increases by 1.\n- if red is true, set other's red to true. But the original's red remains?\n\nWait, the code for the else part (num !=0 and not 1) is:\n\nnum--;\nother.num++;\nif (red) {\n    other.red = true;\n}\n// no change to this box's red?\n\nSo, in this case, the original box still has red as true even after moving a ball? That might be important. So the red flag is only cleared when the last ball is moved (when num was 1). Otherwise, even after moving some balls, the original box's red remains true. But when moving, the destination's red is set to true if the source had red. So the red can be in multiple boxes? Wait, but the problem might be that the red is only present in one box at a time. Wait, maybe the problem's logic is such that the red ball is only in one box at a time. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial setup has the first box with red = true. So when moving from that box, if it has more than one ball, moving one would set the destination's red to true, but the source's red remains? That would mean the red could be in both boxes. But according to the problem's logic, perhaps the red is only in one box. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the problem's requirements. Wait, the problem is from AGC002_B, which is about moving balls between boxes, and counting how many boxes have the red ball at the end. The code's logic must be correct for that problem.\n\nSo the first program's main function initializes N boxes. The first has 1 ball and red is true. The others have 1 but not red. Then for each move, x and y (adjusted by -1) are given, and the move is done from B[x] to B[y]. After all moves, it counts how many boxes have red == true.\n\nThe second Java program is atcoder_ABC170_A. It reads a line of space-separated numbers, counts how many until a \"0\" is encountered, then outputs that count. For example, if input is \"1 2 0 3\", the count is 3 (since it stops at the 0).\n\nNow, the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, where the output of the first is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the counter value) is the input for the second program. The second program then reads that number and counts how many numbers until a 0 is found. Wait, but the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input would be that number followed by other numbers? Or perhaps the first program's output is a single number, which is the input to the second program. Wait, the second program reads a line of space-separated numbers. So the first program's output is a single number, which is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a list of numbers. So the first program's output is a single number, which is the first number in the second program's input. The rest of the input for the second program must be provided by the user? Or perhaps the first program's output is the entire input for the second program. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first program's output. Since the first program outputs a single integer, the second program will read that integer as its input. But the second program expects a list of numbers. So perhaps the first program's output is a single number, which is the first element of the second program's input array, followed by other numbers? Wait, but the second program's code reads a line, splits into an array, and counts until a \"0\" is found. So if the first program's output is, say, 5, then the second program's input is \"5 0\" (so the count would be 2?), or \"5 3 0\" (count 3). But how does the first program's output become the input to the second? The user would have to input the first program's output as the input to the second. But in the problem's context, when they are run in sequence, the first's output is piped into the second's input. So the second program's input is exactly the first's output. So if the first outputs \"5\", then the second's input is \"5\", which is split into [\"5\"], so the count would be 1 (since it's not 0). Wait, but the second program's code counts the number of elements until a \"0\" is found. So if the input is \"5\", then the array is [\"5\"], so the loop adds 1, then checks if \"0\" equals \"5\" (no), so the result is 1. Then it prints 1. So the final output of the entire sequence is 1 in that case.\n\nSo the combined C program must first process the first program's logic, then the second's, without I/O in between. The first program's output (the counter) is the input to the second program, so in the C program, the first part's result is passed to the second part's processing.\n\nNow, to translate this into a single C program.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program) needs to be converted into C code that reads N and M from stdin, processes the moves, and computes the counter (number of boxes with red). The second part (Java's second program) takes that counter as input (as a string?), but in C, since it's all in one program, the first part's result is stored in a variable, then the second part processes that variable as the input array.\n\nWait, the second Java program reads a line of input, splits into strings, and counts until a \"0\" is found. But in the sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a single integer, which is the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"5\", then the second's input is \"5\", so the array is [\"5\"], so the count is 1 (since it's not 0). But if the first outputs \"0\", then the count is 1 (since the first element is \"0\", so the loop adds 1 and breaks, so the result is 1? Wait, the code in the second Java program does:\n\nresult starts at 0. For each string in the array, add 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", break. So for input \"0\", the loop runs once: adds 1, then breaks. So the result is 1. Wait, but the problem says \"count how many until a 0 is found\". So the count includes the 0? Or stops before? Let me check the code again:\n\nIn the second Java program's loop:\n\nfor each string in the array:\n    result +=1\n    if the string is \"0\", break.\n\nSo the count includes the 0. So for input \"0\", the count is 1. For \"1 0 3\", the count is 2 (since after adding 1 for \"1\", then \"0\" adds another 1, then breaks. So total 2).\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the first part's output (the counter) is the input to the second part. So the second part's processing is to take that number as a string, split into an array (but since it's a single number, the array has one element), then count until a \"0\" is found.\n\nWait, but in C, how to handle this? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the C program must read the input for the first part (N and M, then M pairs of numbers). Then process the first part's logic (the boxes and moves), compute the counter (number of boxes with red). Then, this counter is the input to the second part. The second part's job is to process this counter as the input line, split into tokens, and count until a \"0\" is found.\n\nWait, but the second part in Java reads a line of input, splits into strings. So in C, the first part's output (the counter) is a number, which when converted to a string, becomes the input line for the second part. So the second part's processing is to take that string (e.g., \"5\"), split into tokens (split by spaces, but since it's a single number, the array has one element \"5\"), then count the elements until a \"0\" is found.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the counter (the first part's result), we need to simulate the second part's processing on that value as a string.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n1. Read N and M from stdin.\n\n2. Read M pairs of integers (x and y), but note that in Java, they are read as sc.nextInt() -1, so in C, we need to read them, subtract 1 from each.\n\n3. Simulate the Box array. Since in Java, each Box has num and red. So in C, we can represent this with a struct:\n\nstruct Box {\n    int num;\n    bool red;\n};\n\nBut in C, there's no bool, so use int (0 or 1).\n\nInitialize the array of N boxes. The first box has num=1, red=1. The rest have num=1, red=0.\n\nThen, for each move (x and y), perform the move from B[x] to B[y].\n\nThe move function's logic must be implemented as per the Java's Box.moveTo method.\n\nAfter all moves, count how many boxes have red == 1. That's the first part's result (counter).\n\nThen, the second part's processing:\n\nTake the counter value (the first part's output), convert it to a string, then process that string as the input line for the second part.\n\nWait, but how to do that in C without I/O? Because the second part's input is the first's output. So in C, the first part's result is an integer. The second part's processing requires that integer to be treated as a string (the input line). So the steps are:\n\n- Convert the counter (integer) to a string (e.g., \"5\").\n\n- Split that string into tokens (split by spaces). Since it's a single number, the tokens array will have one element: the string representation of the counter.\n\n- Then, count the number of tokens until a \"0\" is found.\n\nWait, but the second part's code in Java reads the entire line, splits into an array, then loops over each element. So in C, the steps would be:\n\nTake the counter value, create a string (like sprintf into a buffer), then split that string into an array of strings (using strtok or similar), then loop through each token, incrementing the result until a \"0\" is found.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n- Read N and M from stdin.\n\n- Read M pairs of integers (x and y), subtract 1 from each.\n\n- Process the boxes as per the first Java program.\n\n- Compute the counter (number of boxes with red).\n\n- Then, process that counter as the input for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe input is the counter's value as a string. So:\n\nchar input_str[20]; // enough to hold the number (assuming it's not too big)\n\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\n\nThen, split the input_str into tokens. Since it's a single number, the tokens array will have one element.\n\nThen, initialize result to 0, loop over each token:\n\nfor each token in the tokens array:\n\n    result +=1\n\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) break;\n\nThen, print the result.\n\nWait, but how to split the string into tokens in C. Let's see:\n\nWe can use strtok. For example:\n\nchar *token;\nchar *input_copy = strdup(input_str); // need to make a copy because strtok modifies the string.\n\ntoken = strtok(input_copy, \" \");\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    // process token\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\n\nBut in this case, since the input_str is a single number, the first token is the entire string, then no more.\n\nAlternatively, since the input_str is just the counter's value, the split will give exactly one token.\n\nSo the code for the second part would be:\n\nint second_result = 0;\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *input_copy = strdup(input_str);\nchar *token = strtok(input_copy, \" \");\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    second_result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) {\n        break;\n    }\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\nfree(input_copy); // since strdup allocates memory.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is over all elements until a \"0\" is found. So even if the token is \"0\", it's counted and then breaks. So the code above is correct.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (String str : input_array) {\n    result +=1;\n    if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n}\n\nSo for each element in the array, add 1 to result, then check if it's \"0\". So the \"0\" is included in the count. So in the C code, the same logic applies.\n\nThus, the code for the second part is as above.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe C program structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Define the Box structure\ntypedef struct {\n    int num;\n    int red; // 0 or 1\n} Box;\n\n// Function to perform the move from src to dst\nvoid move(Box *src, Box *dst) {\n    if (src->num == 0) {\n        return;\n    } else if (src->num == 1) {\n        src->num = 0;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n        src->red = 0;\n    } else {\n        src->num--;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    Box B[N];\n    // Initialize boxes\n    B[0].num = 1;\n    B[0].red = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n        B[i].num = 1;\n        B[i].red = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int x, y;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &x, &y);\n        x--; // since Java subtracts 1\n        y--;\n        move(&B[x], &B[y]);\n    }\n\n    // Compute counter (number of boxes with red)\n    int counter = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        if (B[i].red) counter++;\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part\n    char input_str[20];\n    sprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\n    char *input_copy = strdup(input_str);\n    char *token = strtok(input_copy, \" \");\n    int second_result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        second_result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    free(input_copy);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", second_result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the move function, the parameters are pointers to Box structs. The move function's logic must exactly replicate the Java's Box.moveTo method.\n\nLet me check the move function again.\n\nIn Java's Box.moveTo(other):\n\nif (num == 0) return;\n\nelse if (num ==1:\n\n   num becomes 0.\n\n   other's num increases by 1.\n\n   if red was true, set other's red to true.\n\n   set this red to false.\n\nelse (num>1):\n\n   this num decreases by 1.\n\n   other's num increases by 1.\n\n   if this red is true, set other's red to true.\n\n   (this red remains as is?)\n\nYes, so in the C code's move function:\n\nWhen moving from src to dst:\n\nif src->num ==0: return.\n\nelse if src->num ==1:\n\n   src->num =0.\n\n   dst->num +=1.\n\n   if src->red was true, set dst->red to 1.\n\n   set src->red to 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   src->num -=1.\n\n   dst->num +=1.\n\n   if src->red is true, set dst->red to 1.\n\n   (src->red remains as is?)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the move function in C is correctly implemented.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\n1 0 (N=1, M=0). So no moves. The first box has red=1. So counter is 1.\n\nSecond part's input is \"1\", so the tokens are [\"1\"], so the count is 1 (since it's not 0). So the final output is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\nSo N=2, M=1. The initial boxes are:\n\nBox0: num=1, red=1.\n\nBox1: num=1, red=0.\n\nThe move is x=1 (Java's input is 1, so x becomes 0?), wait wait, the Java code reads x and y, subtracts 1. So in the input, if the first move is 1 and 2 (Java's input), then x becomes 0, y becomes 1 (since 2-1=1).\n\nWait, in the first program's code:\n\nfor each move, x and y are read as sc.nextInt() -1, so in the example above, if the input is 1 2, then x becomes 0, y becomes 1.\n\nSo the move is from box 0 to box1.\n\nProcessing the move:\n\nsrc is box0 (num=1, red=1).\n\nSince num is 1, after moving:\n\nsrc (box0) num becomes 0, red becomes 0.\n\ndst (box1) num becomes 2, red becomes 1 (since src's red was true).\n\nSo after the move, box0 has red 0, box1 has red 1. So the counter is 1 (only box1 has red).\n\nThen the second part's input is 1, so the output is 1.\n\nAnother test case where first program's output is 0:\n\nSuppose N=1, M=1, and the move is from box0 to itself (but in Java, x and y would be 1 and 1, so x=0, y=0. So moving from box0 to itself.\n\nThe move would be:\n\nsrc is box0 (num=1, red=1).\n\nMoving to same box:\n\nIn move function:\n\nsrc is the same as dst.\n\nSo when moving, since num is 1, the code would set src's num to 0, then dst (same as src) num increases by 1 (so 0+1=1?), but that's conflicting.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the move function, when moving from src to dst (same box):\n\nif src's num is 1:\n\n   src->num =0.\n\n   dst (same as src) num +=1 \u2192 becomes 1 again.\n\n   if src's red was true (before the move), set dst's red to true.\n\n   then set src's red to 0.\n\nSo after the move, the box's num is 1 (0+1?), but the red is set to true (because during the move, the code sets dst's red to true (since src's red was true before the move), then src's red is set to 0.\n\nWait, let's step through:\n\nOriginal src (same as dst):\n\nnum =1, red=1.\n\nProcessing move:\n\nsince num is 1:\n\nsrc->num =0.\n\ndst (same as src) num +=1 \u2192 0+1=1.\n\nif src's red (before the move) was true \u2192 yes, so set dst's red to 1.\n\nthen set src's red to 0.\n\nSo after the move, the box has num=1, red=1 (because the dst's red was set to true, but the src's red is set to 0. Wait, but since src and dst are the same, the dst's red is set to true, but then the src's red is set to 0. So the final red is 0?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code in the move function for the case when num is 1:\n\nsrc->num =0;\n\ndst->num +=1;\n\nif (src->red) \u2192 yes, so set dst->red =1.\n\nthen src->red =0.\n\nSo after this, the src (same as dst) has red set to 0, but the dst's red was set to 1. Wait, but since they are the same, the dst's red is set to 1, then the src's red is set to 0. So the final red is 0.\n\nSo after the move, the box has red 0. So the counter would be 0.\n\nThus, the second part's input is 0, so the count is 1 (since the first token is \"0\", so the loop adds 1 and breaks).\n\nThus, the final output is 1.\n\nAnother test case where first program's output is 0, so second part's result is 1.\n\nAnother test case where first program's output is 0, but the second part's input is \"0 5\", but in our case, the first program's output is the entire input for the second. So the first program's output must be a single number. So the second part's input is exactly that number as a string.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, in the C code, the move function is correctly implemented. The second part's processing is also correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The Box array in C is declared as Box B[N], which is okay as long as N is not too big. Since in Java it's an array, and in C it's a VLA (variable-length array), which is allowed in C99. Assuming the compiler supports it.\n\n- The use of strdup: strdup is in string.h, but some environments may not have it. Alternatively, we can manually allocate memory. But for the problem's sake, assuming it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, since the input_str is a single number, we can avoid strdup by using a temporary array. Let me think:\n\nInstead of using strdup, we can make a copy of the string. Since the input_str is a single number, the length is small. So:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *input_copy = malloc(strlen(input_str)+1);\nstrcpy(input_copy, input_str);\n// process with strtok on input_copy\nfree(input_copy);\n\nAlternatively, since the original input_str is a modifiable array (since it's a local array), we can just use strtok on input_str directly, but strtok modifies the string. Since input_str is a local array, that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the input_str is a local array. So instead of making a copy, we can do:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\nint second_result =0;\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    second_result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") ==0) break;\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\n\nThis way, we don't need to use strdup and free. Because we can modify the input_str directly. Since it's a local array, that's okay.\n\nThis would be better, avoiding dynamic memory allocation.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n// After computing counter:\n\nchar input_str[20];\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\nchar *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\nint second_result =0;\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    second_result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") ==0) break;\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\n\nThis is better and avoids memory issues.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int num;\n    int red;\n} Box;\n\nvoid move(Box *src, Box *dst) {\n    if (src->num == 0) return;\n    else if (src->num == 1) {\n        src->num = 0;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n        src->red = 0;\n    } else {\n        src->num--;\n        dst->num++;\n        if (src->red) {\n            dst->red = 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n    Box B[N];\n    B[0].num = 1;\n    B[0].red = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n        B[i].num = 1;\n        B[i].red = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int x, y;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &x, &y);\n        x--;\n        y--;\n        move(&B[x], &B[y]);\n    }\n\n    int counter = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        if (B[i].red) counter++;\n    }\n\n    char input_str[20];\n    sprintf(input_str, \"%d\", counter);\n    char *token = strtok(input_str, \" \");\n    int second_result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        second_result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) break;\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", second_result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work. Let me check the move function again for the case when moving to the same box.\n\nTest case where x and y are the same (e.g., moving from box0 to box0):\n\nSuppose N=1, M=1, and the move is 1 1 (so x=0, y=0).\n\nThe move function is called with src and dst being the same Box.\n\nOriginal state: num=1, red=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nsrc->num is 1 \u2192 enter the first else if.\n\nSet src->num to 0.\n\ndst (same as src) num becomes 0 +1 \u2192 1.\n\nif src's red (before the move) was true \u2192 set dst's red to 1.\n\nThen set src's red to 0.\n\nSo after the move, the box has num=1, red=0 (because after setting dst's red to 1, then src's red is set to 0. Since they are the same, the final red is 0.\n\nThus, the counter is 0. The second part's input is \"0\", so the result is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is 0, so the second part's result is 1.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is 0, but the second part's input is \"0 5\" \u2192 but in our setup, the first program's output is the entire input for the second, so the input is \"0\", so the second part's result is 1.\n\nAnother case where the first program's output is 5, so the second part's input is \"5\", so the result is 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the second part's result is 1.\n\nIf the first program's output is 0 5 (but that's impossible because the first program outputs a single integer). So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the C code should work."
