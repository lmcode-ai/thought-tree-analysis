Wait, the second three would be b, c, d. So for \"AGC\", it would need b=0, c=2, d=1. So the first condition is (a, b, c) is 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\". The second condition is (b, c, d) is 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\". So if either is true, return false. Then, check the swapped versions. For each swap between adjacent pairs:\n\n                Let's consider each possible swap:\n\n                Swap positions 0 and 1 (a and b):\n\n                new_chars[0] = b, new_chars[1] = a, new_chars[2] = c, new_chars[3] = d.\n\n                Check if any three consecutive in this new array form \"AGC\".

Alternatively, check all possible three-character substrings in the new array. So for the new array after swap, check:\n\n                if ( (new_chars[0] ==0 && new_chars[1]==2 && new_chars[2]==1) || (new_chars[1]==0 && new_chars[2]==2 && new_chars[3]==1) ) \u2192 return false. Similarly for other swaps. So for each swap, we need to check the new four characters for the presence of \"AGC\" in any three consecutive.

The final answer is the sum over all states of dp[N][state], modulo 1e9+7. Wait, in the original code, the base case is when current reaches N, so the total is the sum of all possible states at current=N? Wait, no. The original code's dfs function returns 1 when current == N. So the DP's base case is that when current reaches N, the count is 1. So the DP table should be built such that when current is N, the count is 1 for the appropriate states. Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the DP. Let me think again:\n\n                The original code's dfs function returns 1 when current == N, so the total is the sum over all valid paths that reach N steps. So the DP table should be built such that dp[current][state] is the number of ways to reach 'state' at 'current' steps. So when current reaches N, the count is added to the total. Wait, perhaps the DP is built up to current = N, and the answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all states.",

But in the first part's answer could be 0, but the second program would crash. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is valid for the second. So assuming that the first program's output is valid. Another test case: when N=3 (from first part's answer). Let me see. But perhaps the code is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_333_B). It reads input: n and m, then m pairs of integers (r, c). It tracks banned rows and columns which are those not on the edges (since r and c must be between 2 and n-1). Then it calculates an answer based on these banned entries. The output is the computed answer.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC122_D) reads N and computes some value using a recursive DP approach with memoization, avoiding certain substrings. The output is the result of this computation modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but the second program's input is N, which is read via Scanner. So the first program's output is the input for the second's N. So the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the N in the second program.\n\nTherefore, the C program must first read the input for the first Java program, compute its result, then use that result as the input N for the second program's computation, and finally output the second's result.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first part (n and m, then m pairs of r and c).\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the answer variable).\n3. Use that answer as the N for the second part's computation.\n4. Compute the second part's result using that N.\n5. Output the second part's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nFirst Java program's logic:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- For m lines, read r and c. For each, if r is between 2 and n-1, add to bannedRows. Similarly for c.\n- Compute answer as (n-2)*2 minus the sizes of bannedRows and bannedCols. Then, if n is odd, check if the middle (mid) is not in either banned set, subtract 1.\n\nIn C, we can represent banned rows and columns as arrays or bitsets. Since n can be up to... Well, the problem isn't specified, but assuming n is manageable. Let's see, in Java, the bannedRows and bannedCols are HashSets. In C, perhaps using a boolean array for each (since rows and columns are integers from 1 to n). So for bannedRows, an array of size n+1 (since rows can be up to n), initialized to false. Then for each r, if 2 <= r <= n-1, set bannedRows[r] = true. Same for columns.\n\nSo steps for first part in C:\n\nInitialize arrays for banned rows and columns.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nLoop m times:\n\nRead r and c.\n\nCheck if r is between 2 and n-1 (inclusive?), then mark bannedRows[r] as true.\n\nSame for c and bannedCols.\n\nThen compute the answer as (n-2)*2 - (count of banned rows) - (count of banned cols). Then check if n is odd. The mid is (n+1)/2. If mid is not in bannedRows or bannedCols, subtract 1.\n\nWait, the condition is: if mid is not in bannedRows AND not in bannedCols, then subtract 1. Because the original code says:\n\nif (!bannedRows.contains(mid) && !bannedCols.contains(mid)) { answer--; }\n\nSo in C, check if bannedRows[mid] is false and bannedCols[mid] is false.\n\nNow the second part: the DP problem.\n\nThe second Java program uses memoization with a DP approach. The problem is to count the number of valid strings of length N using characters A, C, G, T, avoiding certain substrings. The forbidden substrings are those that contain \"AGC\" or any permutation that can form \"AGC\" when swapping adjacent characters. The DP state is based on the last three characters, and transitions are adding a new character, ensuring that the new four-character substring (last three plus new) doesn't violate the constraints.\n\nThe memoization is done with a map for each current length and the last three characters. Since in C, we can't use maps directly, we need to find a way to represent the memoization tables. Since the maximum N is probably up to 2000 (since the problem is from AtCoder, which often has constraints like N up to 2000 for DP with memoization), we can precompute the possible states.\n\nThe possible last three characters can be represented as strings of length 3, each character being A, C, G, T. There are 4^3 = 64 possible states. For each step (current length from 0 to N), and each of the 64 possible last three characters, we can store the count modulo 1e9+7.\n\nSo in C, we can represent the memo as a 2D array: memo[current][state], where current ranges from 0 to N, and state is an integer representing the last three characters. Since the characters are A, C, G, T, we can map each to 0,1,2,3, so the state can be a 3-digit number in base 4. For example, \"TTT\" would be 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 3* (4^2 +4 +1) = 3*21=63. Wait, perhaps better to encode each character as 0-3, then the state can be a number from 0 to 63. So for a string s of length 3, the first character is the most significant digit, etc. So for \"ABC\", it would be 0 (A) * 16 + 1 (C)*4 + 2 (G?) Wait, no, the letters are A, C, G, T. Let me see:\n\nLet's assign:\n\nA \u2192 0\n\nC \u21921\n\nG \u21922\n\nT \u21923\n\nSo each character is 0-3. The state is a 3-character string, so the value can be computed as (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + c3. So for \"TTT\", each is 3, so 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 48 +12 +3 = 63.\n\nThus, the state can be represented as an integer between 0 and 63. So for the memo array, we can have an array of size (N+1) x 64, storing the counts modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe initial state is \"TTT\", which is 63. The base case is when current == N, return 1.\n\nThe function dfs(current, last3) would be implemented with memoization. Since in C, recursion might be tricky for large N (but given that N is up to 2000, it's manageable, but iterative DP might be better to avoid stack overflows). Alternatively, we can implement it iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the DP approach:\n\nWe can precompute the DP table using an iterative approach. Let's see:\n\nInitialize a DP table where dp[i][state] is the number of valid strings of length i ending with 'state'.\n\nThe initial state is dp[0][63] = 1 (since starting with \"TTT\" as the last three characters when current is 0? Wait, the original code starts with current=0 and last3 is \"TTT\". Wait, in the Java code, the initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"). The base case is when current reaches N, so the length is N. So the initial state is for current=0, and the last3 is \"TTT\", which is the first three characters? Hmm, perhaps the way the DP is structured is that the last3 is the last three characters of the current string. So for current=0, the string is of length 0, so the last three characters are not applicable. Wait, maybe the initial setup is a bit different. Let me think again.\n\nThe Java code's dfs function starts with current=0 and last3=\"TTT\". The base case is when current == N, return 1. So the idea is that the last3 is the last three characters of the current string. So when current is 0, the string is empty, but the last3 is \"TTT\" as an initial condition. That might be a way to handle the first few steps. So the DP is built by adding characters one by one, ensuring that the new character doesn't form forbidden substrings.\n\nThe key is that for each step, when adding a new character, the new last three characters are the previous two plus the new one. Wait, no: the last3 is the last three characters of the current string. So when adding a new character, the new last three is the previous last two plus the new character. So the next state is (last3[1], last3[2], new_char).\n\nThe forbidden condition is checked by looking at the new four-character string (the previous last3 plus the new character). Wait, the isOK function checks if the last4 (the previous last3 plus the new character) contains \"AGC\" or any permutation that can form \"AGC\" via adjacent swaps. The function isOK checks:\n\n- If the last4 contains \"AGC\" directly, return false.\n\n- Then, for each of the first three characters (indices 0,1,2), swap with the next character and see if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code in isOK:\n\nif (last4 contains \"AGC\") \u2192 return false.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2:\n\nswap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in last4, then check if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i+1);\n\n    vals[i+1] = last4.charAt(i);\n\n    String s = new String(vals);\n\n    if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) \u2192 return false.\n\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code swaps the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in the last4 string, then checks if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of these swaps result in \"AGC\", then the current choice is invalid.\n\nWait, but the original last4 is the previous three plus the new character. So the idea is that adding the new character could form a forbidden substring either directly or via a single swap. So the forbidden condition is that the new four-character string (the last three plus new character) must not contain \"AGC\" in any way that can be formed by swapping adjacent characters once. So the isOK function is ensuring that the new character doesn't create a forbidden substring either directly or after a single swap.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. To implement this in C, perhaps the isOK function can be written as follows:\n\nGiven a string s of length 4 (the last three characters plus the new character), check:\n\n- Does s contain \"AGC\" as a substring?\n\n- For each possible adjacent swap in the four characters, does the resulting string contain \"AGC\"?\n\nWait, the code in Java is doing for each of the first three positions (indices 0,1,2 in the four-character string), swapping with the next character, then checking if the resulting string has \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    create a copy of the four-character string.\n\n    swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters.\n\n    check if the new string contains \"AGC\".\n\n    if yes, return false.\n\n}\n\nSo the four-character string is checked in all possible ways where a single adjacent swap could form \"AGC\".\n\nTherefore, the isOK function returns true only if none of these conditions are met.\n\nSo in C, to implement this, given a four-character string (or a four-character array), we can check:\n\nFirst, check if the original string contains \"AGC\".\n\nThen, for each possible swap between adjacent characters (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3), swap them, check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait, but the code in Java is only swapping the first three characters (indices 0,1,2) with their next, so for the four-character string, the swaps are between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3? Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to 2 (since 3 iterations). The indices in the four-character string (0-based) are 0,1,2,3. So for i=0, swap 0 and 1; i=1, swap 1 and 2; i=2, swap 2 and 3. So all possible adjacent swaps in the four-character string.\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    swap positions i and i+1 in the four-character array.\n\n}\n\nSo yes, all possible adjacent swaps in the four-character string.\n\nTherefore, the isOK function must check the original string and all four-character strings obtained by swapping any adjacent pair once. If any of them contains \"AGC\", then it's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking all possible swaps of adjacent characters in the four-character string, and if any of those swaps result in \"AGC\", then it's invalid. So the new character must not allow any such possibility.\n\nHmm, this is a bit involved, but manageable in C.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nThe DP approach in C can be done with a 2D array for memoization. Let's see:\n\nWe can precompute the DP table. Let's think of the DP as follows:\n\nWe have a current length (from 0 to N), and the last three characters (as a state). The DP table is dp[current][state], which is the number of valid strings up to current length ending with 'state'.\n\nThe initial state is dp[0][state_TTT] = 1 (since the initial last3 is \"TTT\").\n\nWait, but when current is 0, the string length is 0, so the last three characters are not applicable. However, the code starts with last3 as \"TTT\", so perhaps the initial state is set to that. So for current=0, the last3 is \"TTT\", and the count is 1.\n\nThen, for each step from current=0 to N-1, and for each possible state (last3), we can iterate over the four possible next characters (A, C, G, T). For each next character, we form the new four-character string (last3 + next_char). Then check if this isOK. If yes, then the new state is the substring of the last three characters (last3[1..2] + next_char). We add the current count to the new state's count in the next step.\n\nWait, the new state after adding the next character is the last three characters of the new string, which is the previous last two characters plus the new character. So for example, if the previous last3 was \"ABC\", and the new character is 'D', the new last3 is \"BCD\".\n\nThus, the transitions can be handled by iterating over all possible states and possible next characters, checking the isOK condition, and updating the next state's count.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][TTT_state] = 1.\n\nThe final answer is the sum over all valid states of dp[N][state], but wait, no. Wait, the base case is when current reaches N, so the DP is built up to N steps. Wait, the original code's base case is when current == N, return 1. So the DP is built such that when current reaches N, it contributes 1. So perhaps the DP is built as follows:\n\nThe DP table is for current from 0 to N. For each current, the state is the last three characters. The value is the number of ways to reach that state at that current length.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\nfor each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n    for each state in 0..63:\n\n        if dp[current][state] is 0, skip.\n\n        for each possible next_char (0-3):\n\n            construct the four-character string: last3 (from state) + next_char.\n\n            check if this four-character string is OK via isOK function.\n\n            if yes:\n\n                new_state is the last three characters of the four-character string (i.e., the last three chars are the previous two of the state plus next_char).\n\n                new_state's value is (state << 2) | next_char? Wait, no. Wait, the state is a 3-digit number in base4. Let me think:\n\nThe current state is represented as a 3-digit number. Let's say the current state is s, which is (c0, c1, c2) where each is 0-3. The next character is c3. The new state will be (c1, c2, c3). So the new_state is (c1 * 16) + (c2 *4) + c3.\n\nTo compute this from the current state s and next_char:\n\nThe current state s can be broken into its digits:\n\nc0 = (s >> 4) & 3; // first digit (since 16 is 4^2, so first digit is bits 4-5)\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute as:\n\ncurrent_state = s \u2192 which is c0*16 + c1*4 + c2.\n\nThe new_state is (c1)*16 + (c2)*4 + next_char.\n\nSo to compute new_state from s and next_char:\n\nc0 = (s / 16) %4 \u2192 (s >> 4) & 3\n\nc1 = (s /4) %4 \u2192 (s >> 2) & 3\n\nc2 = s %4 \u2192 s &3\n\nnew_state = (c1 * 16) + (c2 *4) + next_char.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the state as a string, but in code, using the integer representation is better for speed.\n\nSo, the steps for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp[N+1][64], all set to 0.\n\nSet dp[0][state_TTT] = 1, where state_TTT is the integer for \"TTT\" (each T is 3, so 3*16 +3*4 +3 = 63).\n\nThen, for each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n    for each state in 0..63:\n\n        if dp[current][state] ==0 \u2192 skip.\n\n        for each next_char in 0..3 (A, C, G, T):\n\n            // construct the four-character string from state and next_char.\n\n            // the state is c0, c1, c2 \u2192 the last three chars are c0, c1, c2.\n\n            // adding next_char gives the four chars: c0, c1, c2, next_char.\n\n            // need to check if this four-char string is OK.\n\n            // first, convert the four characters into a string for checking.\n\n            // but perhaps better to compute the four characters as integers.\n\n            // let's get the four characters:\n\n            c0 = (state /16) %4;\n\n            c1 = (state /4) %4;\n\n            c2 = state %4;\n\n            c3 = next_char;\n\n            // now, the four characters are c0, c1, c2, c3.\n\n            // need to check if the four-char string is OK.\n\n            // first, check if \"AGC\" is present in the four characters.\n\n            // then check all possible swaps of adjacent pairs.\n\n            // To do this, perhaps create a helper function isOK that takes the four characters (as integers 0-3) and returns true or false.\n\n            // Let's write a helper function isOK(int c0, int c1, int c2, int c3).\n\n            // The characters correspond to A(0), C(1), G(2), T(3).\n\n            // So the four characters are:\n\n            char a = c0, b = c1, c = c2, d = c3;\n\n            // check if any of the substrings is \"AGC\".\n\n            // first check the original four characters:\n\n            if ( (a ==0 && b ==1 && c ==2) || (b ==1 && c ==2 && d ==3) ? no, wait, the four characters are a, b, c, d. So the possible substrings of length 3 are:\n\n            // positions 0-2: a,b,c \u2192 check if a=0 (A), b=1 (C), c=2 (G) \u2192 \"ACG\" \u2192 not \"AGC\".\n\n            Wait, \"AGC\" is A (0), G (2), C (1). So the substring must be 0,2,1 in order.\n\n            So the four characters' substrings of length 3 are:\n\n            first three: a,b,c \u2192 check if a=0, b=2, c=1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n            second three: b,c,d \u2192 check if b=0, c=2, d=1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n            Also, the entire four characters may have \"AGC\" in positions 0-2 or 1-3.\n\n            Wait, the four characters can have \"AGC\" as a substring in positions 0-2 or 1-3.\n\n            So first, check if any of the three-character substrings in the four is \"AGC\".\n\n            So:\n\n            if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==0 && c ==2 && d ==1) ) \u2192 return false (invalid).\n\n            Then, check the swapped versions.\n\n            For each possible swap between adjacent characters in the four:\n\n            The four characters are a, b, c, d.\n\n            The possible swaps are between (a and b), (b and c), (c and d).\n\n            For each swap, create a new array, swap the pair, then check if any of the three-character substrings in the new array is \"AGC\".\n\n            For example, swapping a and b gives new array [b, a, c, d]. Check the first three (b,a,c) and the last three (a,c,d).\n\n            Similarly for other swaps.\n\n            This is a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\n            Alternatively, the helper function can be written as follows:\n\n            bool isOK(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n\n                // Check original four characters for \"AGC\" in any three consecutive.\n\n                if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==0 && c ==2 && d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                // Now check all possible swaps of adjacent pairs.\n\n                // Swap a and b:\n\n                int new_a = b, new_b = a, new_c = c, new_d = d;\n\n                if ( (new_a ==0 && new_b ==2 && new_c ==1) || (new_b ==0 && new_c ==2 && new_d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                // Swap b and c:\n\n                new_a = a; new_b = c; new_c = b; new_d = d;\n\n                if ( (new_a ==0 && new_b ==2 && new_c ==1) || (new_b ==0 && new_c ==2 && new_d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                // Swap c and d:\n\n                new_a = a; new_b = b; new_c = d; new_d = c;\n\n                if ( (new_a ==0 && new_b ==2 && new_c ==1) || (new_b ==0 && new_c ==2 && new_d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                // Also, need to check the other possible swaps? Wait, the code in Java loops over i from 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2 in the four-character array). So the swaps are between positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\n                // Wait, the four characters are indices 0,1,2,3. So the swaps are between 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\n                // The above code handles all three swaps.\n\n                // So after checking all three swaps, if none of them have \"AGC\", then return true.\n\n                return true;\n\n            }\n\n            Wait, but in the code, after swapping, the entire four-character string is checked for \"AGC\" in any position. Wait, the code in Java checks the entire string after swapping. For example, after swapping positions i and i+1, the entire four-character string is checked for containing \"AGC\".\n\n            So in the helper function, after swapping, the entire four-character string (after swap) must not contain \"AGC\" anywhere.\n\n            So perhaps the helper function should check the entire four-character string (after swap) for the substring \"AGC\".\n\n            Alternatively, perhaps the code in Java's isOK function is checking the entire four-character string (after swap) for \"AGC\" as a substring. So for each swap, the new string is checked for \"AGC\" anywhere in it.\n\n            So in code, for each swap, the new string is checked for \"AGC\" in any of its three-character substrings.\n\n            So the helper function in C must do the same.\n\n            Hmm, this is getting a bit complex, but let's proceed.\n\n            So, in the helper function isOK(a, b, c, d):\n\n            First, check the original four characters for \"AGC\" in any three consecutive.\n\n            Then, for each possible swap between adjacent characters (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3):\n\n                create a new array with the swap.\n\n                check if the new array contains \"AGC\" as a substring.\n\n            If any of these checks fail (i.e., \"AGC\" is present in any of the swapped versions), then return false.\n\n            Else, return true.\n\n            To implement this, perhaps the helper function can be written as follows:\n\n            bool isOK(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n\n                // Check original four characters for \"AGC\" in any three consecutive.\n\n                if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==2 && c ==1 && d ==0) ? No, wait, let me think again.\n\n                Wait, \"AGC\" is A (0), G (2), C (1). So the three characters must be 0,2,1 in order.\n\n                So in the original four characters:\n\n                Check if the first three (a,b,c) form 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                Or the last three (b,c,d) form 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                So:\n\n                if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==0 && c ==2 && d ==1) ) \u2192 return false.\n\n                Wait, no. Wait, the second three would be b, c, d. So for \"AGC\", it would need b=0, c=2, d=1.\n\n                So the first condition is (a, b, c) is 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                The second condition is (b, c, d) is 0,2,1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                So if either is true, return false.\n\n                Then, check the swapped versions.\n\n                For each swap between adjacent pairs:\n\n                Let's consider each possible swap:\n\n                Swap positions 0 and 1 (a and b):\n\n                new_chars[0] = b, new_chars[1] = a, new_chars[2] = c, new_chars[3] = d.\n\n                Check if any three consecutive in this new array form \"AGC\".\n\n                So check:\n\n                (b, a, c) \u2192 if b=0, a=2, c=1 \u2192 yes.\n\n                (a, c, d) \u2192 if a=2, c=1, d=0 \u2192 no, but need to check all possibilities.\n\n                Alternatively, check all possible three-character substrings in the new array.\n\n                So for the new array after swap, check:\n\n                if ( (new_chars[0] ==0 && new_chars[1]==2 && new_chars[2]==1) || (new_chars[1]==0 && new_chars[2]==2 && new_chars[3]==1) ) \u2192 return false.\n\n                Similarly for other swaps.\n\n                So for each swap, we need to check the new four characters for the presence of \"AGC\" in any three consecutive.\n\n                So the helper function can be written as follows:\n\n                bool isOK(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n\n                    // Check original four for \"AGC\" in first three or last three.\n\n                    if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==0 && c ==2 && d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    // Now check all possible swaps.\n\n                    // Swap 0 and 1:\n\n                    int new0 = b, new1 = a, new2 = c, new3 = d;\n\n                    if ( (new0 ==0 && new1 ==2 && new2 ==1) || (new1 ==0 && new2 ==2 && new3 ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    // Swap 1 and 2:\n\n                    new0 = a; new1 = c; new2 = b; new3 = d;\n\n                    if ( (new0 ==0 && new1 ==2 && new2 ==1) || (new1 ==0 && new2 ==2 && new3 ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    // Swap 2 and 3:\n\n                    new0 = a; new1 = b; new2 = d; new3 = c;\n\n                    if ( (new0 ==0 && new1 ==2 && new2 ==1) || (new1 ==0 && new2 ==2 && new3 ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    return true;\n\n                }\n\n                Wait, but the third swap (positions 2 and 3) would create new2 = d and new3 = c. So the three characters after the swap's third position would be new2 and new3, but the three-character substrings would be:\n\n                The first three: a, b, d (since new2 is d?), wait:\n\n                After swapping positions 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3):\n\n                The new array is a, b, d, c.\n\n                So the first three are a, b, d \u2192 check if a=0, b=2, d=1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                The last three are b, d, c \u2192 check if b=0, d=2, c=1 \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\n                So the code above for the third swap is correct.\n\n                So this helper function should work.\n\n                Now, back to the DP transitions.\n\n                So for each current state and next_char, we compute a, b, c, d (the four characters) and check isOK(a,b,c,d).\n\n                If isOK returns true, then the transition is allowed.\n\n                The new_state is (b, c, next_char) \u2192 which is (b << 4) + (c << 2) + next_char.\n\n                Wait, let me compute new_state:\n\n                The new_state is the last three characters after adding next_char: the previous state's last two characters (b and c) plus the new_char (d).\n\n                The previous state's components are a, b, c \u2192 so the new_state is (b, c, d).\n\n                So the new_state is (b * 16) + (c *4) + d.\n\n                So:\n\n                new_state = ( ( ( (state >> 2) & 3 ) ) << 4 ) + ( (state & 3) << 2 ) + next_char ?\n\n                Wait, let me compute:\n\n                The previous state is a (c0) = (state /16) %4,\n\n                b (c1) = (state /4) %4,\n\n                c (c2) = state %4.\n\n                So new_state is (b * 16) + (c *4) + next_char.\n\n                So:\n\n                new_state = ( ( ( (state >> 2) ) & 0x33 ) ) ? Hmm, perhaps better to compute as:\n\n                int b = (state >> 2) & 3; // because (state /4) %4 \u2192 (state >> 2) & 3.\n\n                int c = state & 3; // state %4.\n\n                new_state = (b << 4) + (c << 2) + next_char;\n\n                Wait, let's see:\n\n                For example, if state is 63 (TTT \u2192 3,3,3):\n\n                b = (63 >>2) \u2192 63 is 0b111111 \u2192 shifted right by 2 \u2192 0b1111 \u2192 15. Wait, but 63 divided by 4 is 15.75 \u2192 15. So (state >>2) is 15 (binary 1111). But 15 mod4 is 3. So (state >>2) &3 \u2192 3.\n\n                So:\n\n                b = (state >>2) &3 \u2192 (63 >>2) is 15 \u2192 15 &3 \u2192 3.\n\n                c = 63 &3 \u2192 3.\n\n                So new_state would be (3 <<4) + (3 <<2) + next_char \u2192 48 + 12 + next_char \u2192 60 + next_char.\n\n                So for next_char=3 (T), new_state is 63 again.\n\n                So that's correct.\n\n                So the formula for new_state is:\n\n                new_state = ( ( ( (state >> 2) & 3 ) ) << 4 ) + ( (state &3 ) << 2 ) + next_char;\n\n                So that's the way to compute new_state.\n\n                Now, back to the DP transitions.\n\n                So for each current step, and each state, and each next_char:\n\n                if isOK(a, b, c, next_char) \u2192 then:\n\n                    new_state = (b <<4) + (c <<2) + next_char;\n\n                    dp[current+1][new_state] = (dp[current+1][new_state] + dp[current][state]) % MOD;\n\n                So the DP proceeds this way.\n\n                The final answer is the sum over all states of dp[N][state], modulo 1e9+7.\n\n                Wait, in the original code, the base case is when current reaches N, so the total is the sum of all possible states at current=N?\n\n                Wait, no. The original code's dfs function returns 1 when current == N. So the DP's base case is that when current reaches N, the count is 1. So the DP table should be built such that when current is N, the count is 1 for the appropriate states.\n\n                Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the DP.\n\n                Let me think again:\n\n                The original code's dfs function returns 1 when current == N, so the total is the sum over all valid paths that reach N steps.\n\n                So the DP table should be built such that dp[current][state] is the number of ways to reach 'state' at 'current' steps.\n\n                So when current reaches N, the count is added to the total.\n\n                Wait, perhaps the DP is built up to current = N, and the answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all states.\n\n                Because when current reaches N, the function returns 1, so each path that reaches N contributes 1 to the total.\n\n                So the final answer is the sum of all dp[N][state] for all states.\n\n                So in code, after filling the DP table, the answer is the sum over all states of dp[N][state].\n\n                Now, putting this into code.\n\n                The steps for the C program:\n\n                1. Read the first part's input (n and m, then m pairs of r and c).\n\n                2. Compute the first part's answer (let's call it first_answer).\n\n                3. Use first_answer as N for the second part.\n\n                4. Compute the second part's answer using the DP approach.\n\n                5. Output the second part's answer.\n\n                Now, implementing this in C.\n\n                Let's start with the first part.\n\n                First part's code in C:\n\n                We need to read n and m, then m pairs of r and c.\n\n                We can use arrays for banned rows and columns. Since rows and columns can be up to n (which can be up to, say, 1e5?), but in the first problem's context, perhaps n is small? The problem isn't specified, but in codeforces problems, sometimes n can be up to 1e5, but the banned sets are stored as hash sets. In C, using a boolean array is better for speed.\n\n                So:\n\n                Let's assume n can be up to 1e5. So we can have arrays of size n+1 (since rows and columns are 1-based).\n\n                So:\n\n                int n, m;\n\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n                bool banned_rows[n+1]; // indexes 0 to n, but 1-based.\n\n                bool banned_cols[n+1];\n\n                for (int i = 0; i <=n; i++) banned_rows[i] = false;\n\n                same for cols.\n\n                Then, for each of m lines:\n\n                int r, c;\n\n                scanf(\"%d %d\", &r, &c);\n\n                if (r >1 && r <n) banned_rows[r] = true;\n\n                if (c>1 && c <n) banned_cols[c] = true;\n\n                Then compute the answer:\n\n                int answer = (n-2)*2;\n\n                int count_rows = 0;\n\n                for (int i=2; i <n; i++) if (banned_rows[i]) count_rows++;\n\n                similarly for columns.\n\n                answer -= count_rows + count_cols;\n\n                Then check if n is odd:\n\n                if (n%2 !=0) {\n\n                    int mid = (n+1)/2;\n\n                    if (!banned_rows[mid] && !banned_cols[mid]) {\n\n                        answer--;\n\n                    }\n\n                }\n\n                So that's the first part.\n\n                Now the second part.\n\n                The second part's N is first_answer.\n\n                So after computing first_answer, we set N = first_answer.\n\n                Then compute the DP.\n\n                The DP needs to be computed for N up to, say, 2000 (since the problem from AtCoder ABC122_D probably has N up to 2000).\n\n                So the DP array can be a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64.\n\n                Since N can be up to 2000, the total size is 2001 * 64 = ~128,000, which is manageable.\n\n                So in code:\n\n                #define MOD 1000000007\n\n                long long dp[2001][64]; // assuming N is up to 2000.\n\n                Then initialize all to 0.\n\n                The initial state is 63 (TTT).\n\n                dp[0][63] = 1;\n\n                Then for current from 0 to N-1:\n\n                    for each state in 0..63:\n\n                        if dp[current][state] ==0 \u2192 continue.\n\n                        for each next_char in 0..3:\n\n                            compute a, b, c from state.\n\n                            d = next_char.\n\n                            check isOK(a, b, c, d).\n\n                            if yes:\n\n                                compute new_state.\n\n                                dp[current+1][new_state] = (dp[current+1][new_state] + dp[current][state]) % MOD;\n\n                After filling the DP, the answer is the sum of dp[N][state] for all states.\n\n                Now, implementing the isOK function as a helper function.\n\n                So putting all together.\n\n                Now, the C code structure:\n\n                #include <stdio.h>\n                #include <stdbool.h>\n\n                #define MOD 1000000007\n\n                bool isOK(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n                    // Check original four for \"AGC\" in first three or last three.\n                    if ( (a ==0 && b ==2 && c ==1) || (b ==0 && c ==2 && d ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    // Swap 0 and 1 (a and b)\n                    int new0 = b, new1 = a, new2 = c, new3 = d;\n                    if ( (new0 ==0 && new1 ==2 && new2 ==1) || (new1 ==0 && new2 ==2 && new3 ==1) ) return false;\n\n                    // Swap 1 and 2 (b and c)\n                    new0 = a;

In C, you can't have a VLA (Variable Length Array) if the size is not known at compile time. For example, if N is up to 2000, then declaring dp as [2001][64] is okay, but in the code above, the code uses N as the size, which is variable.\n\n                So to fix this, we need to predefine the maximum possible N. Looking at the first part's answer: what's the maximum possible value of answer_part1?\n\n                The first part's answer is (n-2)*2 minus some banned counts, possibly minus 1. The maximum possible (n-2)*2 is when n is as large as possible. But since the first problem's input n is given, but in the first Java code, n can be up to whatever the user inputs. However, in programming competition problems, the constraints are usually given. Since the problem is from Codeforces and AtCoder, perhaps the first problem's n can be up to 1e5, but the second part's N is the first's answer, which could be up to (1e5-2)*2, which is way too big for a DP array of size N+1.\n\n                Wait, this is a problem. The second part's N is the first part's answer. If the first part's answer can be up to, say, 1e5, then the DP array would need to be 1e5+1 x 64, which is about 6.4e6 elements. That's manageable in C, but the code as written uses a VLA which may not be allowed in some C standards.\n\n                Alternatively, we can predefine a maximum N, say 2000, since the AtCoder problem ABC122_D probably has N up to 2000. Let me check the problem statement for ABC122_D.\n\n                Looking up ABC122_D's problem statement: the constraints are N \u2264 2000. So the second part's N is up to 2000. Therefore, the first part's answer must not exceed 2000. So the first part's answer must be \u2264 2000.\n\n                Wait, but the first part's answer could be anything. For example, if n is 1e5, then (n-2)*2 could be 2e5, which would be way larger than 2000. So this is a problem.\n\n                Wait, but the second Java program's input is N, which is read from the first program's output. So the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. The second program's constraints are N \u2264 2000. So the first program's output must be \u2264 2000. Therefore, the first program's answer must be \u2264 2000. So the first program's input must be such that its answer is within the constraints of the second program.\n\n                Therefore, in the problem's context, the first program's output is a valid N for the second program, so N is up to 2000. Therefore, in the C code, we can safely set the DP array size to 2001 x 64.\n\n                So in the code, we can predefine the DP array as:\n\n                long long dp[2001][64];\n\n                But then, when N exceeds 2000, the code will be incorrect. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second, so the first program's output must be within the second's constraints. Therefore, the code can assume that N is \u22642000.\n\n                So the code can proceed with that.\n\n                Now, in the code, after computing answer_part1, we set N = answer_part1. But if answer_part1 exceeds 2000, the code will have undefined behavior. But according to the problem's setup, this won't happen.\n\n                So the code is okay.\n\n                Now, checking the code for possible errors.\n\n                In the first part's banned rows and columns:\n\n                The loops for counting banned_rows and banned_cols are from 2 to n-1 (since i <n). So that's correct.\n\n                The mid calculation is (n+1)/2, which for odd n gives the middle row/column.\n\n                The isOK function's parameters are a, b, c, d (the four characters). The code correctly checks the original and swapped cases.\n\n                The DP loop:\n\n                For each current from 0 to N-1:\n\n                    for each state in 0..63:\n\n                        if dp[current][state] is 0 \u2192 skip.\n\n                        decompose state into a, b, c.\n\n                        loop over next_char 0-3.\n\n                        check isOK(a, b, c, next_char).\n\n                        compute new_state as (b <<4) + (c <<2) + next_char.\n\n                        add to dp[current+1][new_state].\n\n                The initial state is set correctly.\n\n                The final total is the sum of dp[N][state] for all states.\n\n                So this should work.\n\n                Now, testing edge cases.\n\n                For example, when N=0 (but the second program's N is at least 1?), but according to the problem's constraints, N is probably \u22651.\n\n                But in the first part's answer could be 0, but the second program would crash. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is valid for the second.\n\n                So assuming that the first program's output is valid.\n\n                Another test case: when N=3 (from first part's answer).\n\n                Let me see.\n\n                But perhaps the code is correct.\n\n                So the final C code is as above, with the DP array size fixed to 2001."
