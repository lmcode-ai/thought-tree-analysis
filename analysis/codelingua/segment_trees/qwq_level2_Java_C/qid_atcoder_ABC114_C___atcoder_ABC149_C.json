First, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C). It reads an integer N from input. Then it starts with a number i = 357 and counts how many numbers up to N (inclusive) contain the digits 3,5,7. But wait, the loop condition is while i <= N, so it's generating numbers in some way and checking each. The code also has a part where it builds a new number from the current i. Let me see:\n\nThe loop starts with i=357.",

The code loops over each character in the string s (which is the current i as a string). The loop is from the end to the start, but the code is building the next number in a certain way.

Alternatively, converting to a string and checking for presence. Alternatively, using the string approach:\n\nchar s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", num);\n\nthen check if '3', '5', '7' are all present.

Now, the second part of the program is to compute the next prime after c (or c+1 if even). Now, the second Java program's logic:\n\nThe second program takes x as input, and finds the next prime >= x (with adjustments for even numbers). The steps are:\n\nif x is even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes x+1 (so odd). then, loop:\n\n   check if x is prime. if not, add 2 and repeat.\n\n   else, break and output x.

The code in Java:\n\nfor (i =3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n    if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n}\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 prime. So the is_prime function in C should do the same. Thus, the is_prime function can be written as:\n\nint is_prime(long long n) {\n\n    if (n <=1) return 0;\n\n    if (n ==2) return 1;\n\n    if (n%2 ==0) return 0;\n\n    long long sqrt_n = (long long)sqrt(n);\n\n    for (long long i=3; i <= sqrt_n; i +=2) {\n\n        if (n%i ==0) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in code, sqrt(n) can be computed as sqrt((double)n), but we need to cast to long long.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C). It reads an integer N from input. Then it starts with a number i = 357 and counts how many numbers up to N (inclusive) contain the digits 3,5,7. But wait, the loop condition is while i <= N, so it's generating numbers in some way and checking each. The code also has a part where it builds a new number from the current i. Let me see:\n\nThe loop starts with i=357. For each i, it checks if the string representation contains all three digits 3,5,7. If so, increments a counter. Then it constructs a new number by processing the digits of i. The way it builds the next number is a bit tricky. The code uses a StringBuilder to reverse the digits and modify them. Let me parse that part.\n\nThe code loops over each character in the string s (which is the current i as a string). The loop is from the end to the start, but the code is building the next number in a certain way. The logic is:\n\n- Start with a StringBuilder sb.\n- The variable 'f' is a flag. Initially false.\n- For each character in reverse order (since j starts from 0 to s.length-1, but the index is s.length-1 -j, so first character is last digit of i, then previous, etc.):\n   - If f is false, then check the current digit (a). \n   - If a is '3', then append '5' to sb and set f to true.\n   - If a is '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n   - Else, append '3'.\n   - If f is already true, just append the current digit as is.\n- After processing all digits, if f is still false, append a '3' to the end.\n- Then reverse the sb (since the digits were processed in reverse order?), wait no, the code uses sb2 which is a StringBuffer (similar to StringBuilder) and then reverses it again? Wait, the code does:\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nsb is built by processing the digits in reverse order (since the loop is over s.length-1 -j, so starting from the last digit of the original number). Then, after building the sb, they create a StringBuffer sb2 (which is a copy of sb), then reverse it again. Wait, that might be a mistake? Let me see:\n\nWait, the code:\n\nString s = String.valueOf(i); // i is the current number, e.g. 357 is \"357\".\n\nThen, the loop for j from 0 to s.length() -1:\n\nThe first character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -0) which is the last character of s. So for \"357\", the first character is '7', then next is '5', then '3'.\n\nSo the loop processes the digits in reverse order (from the end to the start of the original string). The code builds the sb by processing each digit in reverse order, then after building, they create a StringBuffer sb2 (which is a copy of sb), then reverse it again. Wait, that would reverse the sb's content again, so the final string is the original order?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 357. The string s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (so first '7', then '5', then '3').\n\nLet me walk through the first iteration (i=357):\n\ns is \"357\".\n\nThe loop for j from 0 to 2 (since length is 3):\n\nj=0: the character is s[2] (since 3-1-0 =2?), so '7'.\n\nAt this point, f is false. So check if a is '3'? No. '5'? No. So else, append '3' to sb. Then f remains false?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') then append '5' and set f to true.\n\nElse if a is '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n\nElse (which is a is not 3 or 5), append '3'.\n\nSo for the first character (a is '7'), since it's not 3 or 5, append '3' to sb. f remains false.\n\nThen j=1: next character is s[1] (since 3-1-1 =1?), which is '5'.\n\nNow, since f is still false, check a is '5'? yes. So append '7' to sb, and set f to true.\n\nThen j=2: next character is s[0], which is '3'.\n\nNow, since f is true, we just append the a (which is '3').\n\nSo after processing all characters, the sb has \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step). So the sb is \"373\".\n\nWait, the order is the processing is in reverse order of the digits, so the first character processed is the last digit of the original number. So the sb is built as follows:\n\nAfter processing all three digits, the sb is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the code creates a StringBuffer sb2 (which is a copy of sb), then reverses it. So the reversed of \"373\" is \"373\", so the new i is 373.\n\nWait, but then the next iteration would start with i=373. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code then does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, but when you reverse a StringBuffer, it modifies the buffer. So when you do sb2.reverse(), the sb2 is now reversed. So the code is taking the reversed string of the sb's content. Wait, let me think again:\n\nOriginal sb is \"373\". Then sb2 is a copy of sb (so \"373\"), then reverse it \u2192 becomes \"373\" (since it's a palindrome). So the new i is 373. So the next iteration's i is 373.\n\nWait, but in the first step, the initial i is 357. After processing, the next i is 373. Then in the next iteration, check if 373 <= N. Suppose N is large enough, then proceed.\n\nThe code counts how many numbers in this sequence (starting at 357, then 373, etc.) up to N have all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nWait, the count c is incremented only if the current i (the original number) has all three digits. So the loop is generating numbers in some way, and for each generated number, check if it contains 3,5,7. The loop continues until the generated number exceeds N.\n\nHmm, so the first program is generating numbers in a certain way starting from 357, and counts how many of them up to N have all three digits present.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an input x, and finds the next prime number after x that is odd (since if x is even and not 2, it increments to x+1, then checks for primes by stepping by 2). Wait, the code starts by checking if x is even and not 2, then increments to x+1 (so it becomes odd). Then enters a loop where it checks if x is prime. If not, adds 2 each time until it finds a prime. The output is that prime.\n\nSo the second program finds the next prime number greater than or equal to x, but if x is even and not 2, it starts checking from x+1 (the next odd). Wait, let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nSo if x is even and not 2, then x becomes x+1 (so odd). Then the loop starts. The loop checks if x is prime. The way it checks is by trying divisors from 3 up to sqrt(x), stepping by 2 (since even numbers are skipped). If any divisor divides x, then it breaks and increments x by 2 (so stays odd). The loop continues until a prime is found.\n\nSo the second program's output is the smallest prime >= x, except when x is even (and not 2), then it's the smallest prime >=x+1 (so the next odd after x).\n\nNow, the problem is to combine these two Java programs into a single C program where the first program's output is the input to the second, but in C, we have to do it in a single program without I/O in between.\n\nWait, the original setup is that the first Java program reads input (N), processes it, and outputs a number (c). Then the second Java program reads that c as its input x, and outputs the next prime. So the overall behavior is: given an input N, compute c (from first program), then compute the next prime after c (or c+1 if even), and output that prime.\n\nTherefore, the C program must read N from input, compute c as per the first program, then compute the next prime as per the second program, and output that prime.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N from stdin.\n\n2. Compute c (the count from the first Java program).\n\n3. Use c as the input to the second program's logic (i.e., compute the next prime after c, considering the evenness as per the second program's logic).\n\n4. Output the result of step 3.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read N from input.\n\n- Compute c by simulating the first Java program's logic (without I/O).\n\n- Then compute the next prime as per the second program's logic, using c as the starting x.\n\n- Output the final prime.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into C.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's main logic:\n\nThe first program's main loop starts with i=357, and loops while i <= N. For each i, check if the digits contain 3,5,7. Then generate the next i by some process.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- For each current i, check if it contains all three digits. If yes, increment c.\n\n- Generate the next i by processing the digits of the current i as per the code's logic.\n\nThe digit processing part is crucial. Let's re-express that in C.\n\nThe code for generating the next i is:\n\nTake the current i as a string, process each digit in reverse order (from last digit to first), building a new number.\n\nThe processing steps for each digit (in reverse order):\n\nInitialize a flag f = false.\n\nFor each digit in reverse order (starting from the last digit of i):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the digit is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if digit is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3'.\n\n   else:\n\n      append the digit as is.\n\nAfter processing all digits, if f is still false, append a '3'.\n\nThen, reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, let me re-express this in steps.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nTake i = 357 \u2192 string \"357\".\n\nProcessing digits in reverse order: '7', '5', '3'.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false. Since it's not 3 or 5, append '3'. f remains false?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nElse if a is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nElse (a is neither 3 nor 5) \u2192 append '3', but f remains false?\n\nYes. So for the first digit (7):\n\nappend '3', f is still false.\n\nSecond digit (5):\n\nNow, f is still false. The digit is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nNow, f is true, so append the digit (3) as is.\n\nSo the sb after processing all digits is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the code appends a '3' only if f is still false? Wait, in this case, after processing all digits, f is true (because in the second step, it was set to true). So the 'if (!f)' condition is false, so no append.\n\nThen, the code creates a StringBuffer sb2 (copy of sb), reverses it, and parses as long.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is \"373\", then sb2 is a copy of that. Then reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\". So the new i is 373.\n\nSo the next iteration's i is 373.\n\nNow, let's see the next step for i=373:\n\nThe string is \"373\".\n\nProcessing digits in reverse order: '3', '7', '3'.\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false. Since it's '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"573\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true, no extra '3' is added. Then reverse the sb (since the code reverses the sb2, which is a copy of sb). The sb is \"573\", reversed becomes \"375\". So the new i is 375.\n\nWait, wait, the code's process is:\n\nAfter building the sb, the code creates a StringBuffer (which is like a copy of sb), then reverses it, and parses that as the new i.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nAfter building the sb (the new digits in the processed order), then:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 copies the sb's content.\n\nThen, i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the reverse is applied to the sb's content. So the new i is the reverse of the sb's string.\n\nWait, in the first example, the sb was \"373\", so reversing gives \"373\", so i becomes 373 again? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, in the first example, the sb after processing was \"373\", so reversing it would still be \"373\", so the new i is 373. But that would mean the loop would continue with i=373 again, leading to an infinite loop?\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the processing steps.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first example again.\n\nOriginal i is 357 \u2192 \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false. Since it's not 3 or 5, append '3'. f remains false?\n\nWait, no. The code says:\n\nif (a == '3') \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nElse if (a == '5') \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nElse \u2192 append '3', but f remains false.\n\nSo for the first digit (7), since it's not 3 or 5, append '3', and f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (5):\n\nNow, f is still false. The digit is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nNow, f is true \u2192 append the digit (3).\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f is now true, the 'if (!f)' condition is false, so no appending of '3'.\n\nThen, the code creates sb2 as a copy of sb (so \"373\"), then reverses it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nThus, the new i is 373. So the next iteration's i is 373.\n\nWait, but then in the next iteration, the same process would repeat, leading to the same i again. That would cause an infinite loop unless the condition i <= N is not met.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the processing steps. Maybe the code is supposed to generate numbers in a way that increases each time, but perhaps I made a mistake in the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's way of generating the next i is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's processing is building the next number by appending digits in a certain way. Let me see another example.\n\nTake the second step where i is 373:\n\nThe string is \"373\".\n\nProcessing digits in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false. Since it's '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"573\".\n\nThen, since f is true, no extra '3' is added. Then, the code reverses the sb (so \"573\" reversed is \"375\"), so the new i is 375.\n\nAh, right! Because in this case, the sb is \"573\", so reversing it gives \"375\".\n\nSo the next i is 375.\n\nAh, I see. So the key is that the sb is built in a way that the digits are processed in reverse order, but then the final step is to reverse the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe digits are processed in reverse order (from the last digit to first of the original number), building the sb in a certain way, then the sb is reversed to form the next number.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the digits in reverse order (so the first character processed is the last digit of the original number). The sb is built in the order of processing, so the first character added to the sb is the first processed digit (the last digit of the original number). Then, after building the sb, the code reverses it to get the next number.\n\nWait, let me think of the first example again:\n\nOriginal i is 357 \u2192 \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst step (digit 7):\n\nappend '3' \u2192 sb is \"3\".\n\nSecond step (digit 5):\n\nappend '7' \u2192 sb is \"37\".\n\nThird step (digit 3):\n\nappend '3' \u2192 sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, the code reverses this sb (so \"373\" becomes \"373\"), so the new i is 373.\n\nWait, but in the second example (i=373):\n\nProcessing digits in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nappend '5' \u2192 sb starts with \"5\".\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nappend '7' \u2192 \"57\".\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nappend '3' \u2192 \"573\".\n\nThen, reversing gives \"375\".\n\nAh, so the next i is 375.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nThe next number is formed by taking the current number's digits, processing each digit in reverse order (starting from the last digit), building a new string according to the rules, then reversing that string to get the next number.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm for generating the next i is:\n\n1. Convert current i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each character in s in reverse order (from last to first).\n\n3. For each character in this reversed order:\n\n   a. If the flag f is false:\n\n      i. If the character is '3', append '5' to the new string and set f to true.\n\n      ii. Else if it's '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n\n      iii. Else, append '3'.\n\n   b. Else:\n\n      i. Append the character as is.\n\n4. After processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3'.\n\n5. Reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but step 5 is reversing the string built in steps 2-4. Because the code's final step is to reverse the sb (after building it in the order of processing the reversed digits). So the next i is the reverse of the sb's content.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the digits in reverse order (so the first character in the sb corresponds to the last digit of the original number). Then, the code reverses the sb to get the next number. So the next number is the reverse of the sb's content.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 357 \u2192 s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 append '3' (since it's not 3 or 5). f is false.\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 since f is still false, append '7' (since it's 5), set f to true.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 since f is true, append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing this gives \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nIn the next step, i is 373 \u2192 s is \"373\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3) \u2192 f is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond character (7) \u2192 f is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\", so next i is 375.\n\nSo the next number is 375.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, to implement this in C, I need to:\n\nFor each current i (starting at 357), do the following steps until i exceeds N:\n\n1. Check if the current i contains all three digits 3,5,7. If yes, increment c.\n\n2. Generate the next i as per the above steps.\n\nThe first step (checking digits) can be done by converting the number to a string, then checking for presence of '3', '5', and '7'.\n\nThe second step (generating next i) requires processing the digits as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, in C, handling numbers and their digits can be done via string manipulation or by processing digits numerically.\n\nLet me think of how to implement the digit processing.\n\nFirst, for the first part (checking if the number contains 3,5,7):\n\nWe can convert the number to a string, then check each character.\n\nFor the second part (generating the next i):\n\nWe can process the digits as follows:\n\n- Convert the current i to a string s.\n\n- Iterate over the characters in reverse order (from the end to the start of s).\n\n- Build a new string (the sb in Java) according to the rules.\n\n- Then reverse this new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but in C, strings are a bit more cumbersome. Let's think of steps.\n\nFirst, to process the digits of the current i:\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nGiven current i (as a long), we need to generate the next i.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Initialize a new string (char array) to build the sb.\n\n3. Initialize a flag f = 0 (false).\n\n4. Iterate over each character in s in reverse order (from s[length-1] down to s[0]).\n\n5. For each character c in this reversed order:\n\n   a. if f is 0:\n\n      i. if c == '3', append '5' to the new string, set f=1.\n\n      ii. else if c == '5', append '7', set f=1.\n\n      iii. else, append '3'.\n\n   b. else:\n\n      append c to the new string.\n\n6. After processing all characters, if f is still 0, append '3' to the new string.\n\n7. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but step 7 is to reverse the new string (the sb) to get the next i. Because in the Java code, after building the sb, they reverse it again (since the code does sb2.reverse().toString()).\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the reversed digits (so the first character in the sb corresponds to the last digit of the original number). Then, the code reverses the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe sb is built in the order of processing the reversed digits (so the first character added to the sb is the last digit of the original number). Then, the code reverses the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nAfter building the sb (the new string), they create a StringBuffer sb2 (copy of sb), then reverse it, and parse that as the new i.\n\nSo the next i is the reverse of the sb's content.\n\nWait, the sb is built in the order of processing the reversed digits. So the sb's content is the new digits in the order of processing (which is the reverse of the original digits). Then, reversing it gives the next number.\n\nWait, for example, in the first case:\n\nOriginal digits: 3,5,7 \u2192 reversed order is 7,5,3.\n\nProcessing gives the sb as \"3\", \"7\", \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nReversing gives \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the original i's digits except the middle digit changed from 5 to 7?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the code's process as follows:\n\nThe next number is formed by taking the current number's digits, and for each digit from right to left (starting at the last digit), apply the transformation rules, then reverse the resulting string to get the next number.\n\nAlternatively, the next number is the reverse of the transformed string built from the reversed digits.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nnext_i = reverse( transformed_string )\n\nwhere transformed_string is built by processing the digits in reverse order (from last to first) of the current i.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nTo generate the next i:\n\n- Convert current i to a string s.\n\n- Process each character in s in reverse order (from last to first), building a new string (transformed_str) according to the rules.\n\n- Then reverse transformed_str to get the next i.\n\nWait, no. Because the code's process is:\n\nThe transformed_str is built by processing the reversed digits (so the first character in transformed_str is the first processed digit, which is the last digit of the original number). Then, the next i is the reverse of transformed_str.\n\nWait, in the first example, transformed_str is \"373\", reversed gives \"373\".\n\nIn the second example (i=373):\n\ntransformed_str is \"573\", reversed gives \"375\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the next i is the reverse of the transformed_str.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. transformed_str is built by processing the digits in reverse order (from last to first) of the current i.\n\n2. The next i is the reverse of transformed_str.\n\nThus, in code, the next i is the reverse of the transformed_str.\n\nTherefore, in C, to implement this:\n\nWe can do the following steps:\n\n- Convert current i to a string s.\n\n- Create a new string (char array) for transformed_str.\n\n- Iterate over s in reverse order (from the end to the start).\n\n- For each character in this reversed order, apply the transformation rules, appending to transformed_str.\n\n- After processing all characters, if the flag f was never set (i.e., f remains 0), append '3' to transformed_str.\n\n- Then, reverse transformed_str to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the transformed_str is built in the order of processing the reversed digits. So the first character in transformed_str is the first processed digit (the last digit of the original number). The next characters are added in order. So the transformed_str is built as per the processing steps, and then reversed to get the next i.\n\nWait, no. The code's process is that the transformed_str is the sb, and then reversed to get the next i. So the next i is the reverse of the transformed_str.\n\nTherefore, the next i is the reverse of the transformed_str.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nnext_i = reverse(transformed_str)\n\nSo, in C, to compute next_i:\n\nWe can first build the transformed_str as a string, then reverse it, then convert to a number.\n\nNow, implementing this in C requires handling strings and their manipulation.\n\nFirst, let's think of the steps for the first part (counting c):\n\nInitialize c =0, i=357.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   check if the current i contains all three digits 3,5,7 \u2192 if yes, increment c.\n\n   generate next i as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in C.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nRead N from stdin.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nlong long i = 357;\n\nint c =0;\n\nloop:\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n   check if contains 3,5,7 \u2192 if yes, c++;\n\n   generate next i.\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the next prime as per the second program's logic, using c as the input x.\n\nNow, the first challenge is to implement the contains check.\n\nFunction to check if a number has all three digits:\n\nWe can write a helper function:\n\nint has357(long long num) {\n\n    int has3 =0, has5=0, has7=0;\n\n    while (num >0) {\n\n        int d = num%10;\n\n        if (d ==3) has3=1;\n\n        else if (d ==5) has5=1;\n\n        else if (d ==7) has7=1;\n\n        num /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    return has3 && has5 && has7;\n\n}\n\nWait, but this would check each digit. Alternatively, converting to a string and checking for presence.\n\nAlternatively, using the string approach:\n\nchar s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", num);\n\nthen check if '3', '5', '7' are all present.\n\nEither way is okay. Let's pick the string approach for simplicity.\n\nFunction:\n\nint has357(long long num) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", num);\n\n    int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n\n    for (int i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == '3') has3=1;\n\n        else if (s[i] == '5') has5=1;\n\n        else if (s[i] == '7') has7=1;\n\n    }\n\n    return has3 && has5 && has7;\n\n}\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate the next i.\n\nImplementing the next i:\n\nWe need to process the current i's digits in reverse order, build the transformed_str, then reverse it to get next i.\n\nLet's write a function to compute next_i from current i.\n\nlong long next_i(long long current) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", current);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    // process in reverse order (from s[len-1] down to s[0])\n\n    char transformed[20]; // enough space?\n\n    int f =0;\n\n    int pos =0;\n\n    for (int j=0; j < len; j++) {\n\n        char c = s[len-1 -j]; // the j-th character from the end (starting at last character)\n\n        if (!f) {\n\n            if (c == '3') {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '5';\n\n                f=1;\n\n            } else if (c == '5') {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '7';\n\n                f=1;\n\n            } else {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '3';\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            transformed[pos++] = c;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check if f is still 0 \u2192 append '3'\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        transformed[pos++] = '3';\n\n    }\n\n    transformed[pos] = '\\0';\n\n    // now reverse transformed to get the next i.\n\n    char reversed[20];\n\n    int len_t = pos;\n\n    for (int k=0; k < len_t; k++) {\n\n        reversed[k] = transformed[len_t -1 -k];\n\n    }\n\n    reversed[len_t] = '\\0';\n\n    // convert to long long\n\n    return atoll(reversed);\n\n}\n\nWait, but need to make sure the transformed array is large enough. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum possible length of current is up to, say, 18 digits (since current can be up to N which is up to 1e18?), but in the first program's loop, the next i is generated by appending digits, so the length can grow. But in the problem's context, perhaps N is up to 1e18, but the code may not handle very large numbers. However, in C, using long long (64-bit) can handle up to 9e18, so perhaps it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the initial i is 357, and each step appends digits, so the numbers can grow exponentially? Not sure, but the code must handle it as per the problem's constraints.\n\nAssuming that the transformed string can be up to, say, 20 characters (since even 357... with many digits would be manageable).\n\nNow, the function next_i takes current and returns the next i.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe first part of the C program:\n\nRead N from stdin.\n\nInitialize i=357, c=0.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   if (has357(i)) c++;\n\n   compute next_i as next_i(i).\n\n   set i = next_i.\n\nWait, but in the loop, after processing i, we need to set i to the next value.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n   if (has357(i)) c++;\n\n   i = next_i(i);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the next_i function returns the next value. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part of the program is to compute the next prime after c (or c+1 if even).\n\nNow, the second Java program's logic:\n\nThe second program takes x as input, and finds the next prime >= x (with adjustments for even numbers).\n\nThe steps are:\n\nif x is even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes x+1 (so odd).\n\nthen, loop:\n\n   check if x is prime.\n\n   if not, add 2 and repeat.\n\n   else, break and output x.\n\nSo in C, the function to compute the next prime:\n\nlong long next_prime(long long x) {\n\n    if (x ==2) return 2;\n\n    if (x%2 ==0) x++;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        if (is_prime(x)) return x;\n\n        x +=2;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut need to implement is_prime.\n\nImplementing is_prime:\n\nFunction to check if a number is prime.\n\nlong long is_prime(long long n) {\n\n    if (n <=1) return 0;\n\n    if (n ==2) return 1;\n\n    if (n%2 ==0) return 0;\n\n    for (long long i=3; i*i <=n; i +=2) {\n\n        if (n%i ==0) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the second Java program's code, the loop for checking divisors starts at 3 and increments by 2, up to sqrt(x). The code in Java:\n\nfor (i =3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n    if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n}\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 prime.\n\nSo the is_prime function in C should do the same.\n\nThus, the is_prime function can be written as:\n\nint is_prime(long long n) {\n\n    if (n <=1) return 0;\n\n    if (n ==2) return 1;\n\n    if (n%2 ==0) return 0;\n\n    long long sqrt_n = (long long)sqrt(n);\n\n    for (long long i=3; i <= sqrt_n; i +=2) {\n\n        if (n%i ==0) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in code, sqrt(n) can be computed as sqrt((double)n), but we need to cast to long long.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt_n as floor(sqrt(n)) +1 to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt_n as (long long)sqrt(n) and then check up to that.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, the code should work as per the Java's logic.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe C program structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <math.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Functions:\n\nint has357(long long num) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", num);\n\n    int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n\n    for (int i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == '3') has3=1;\n\n        else if (s[i] == '5') has5=1;\n\n        else if (s[i] == '7') has7=1;\n\n    }\n\n    return has3 && has5 && has7;\n\n}\n\nlong long next_i(long long current) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", current);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    char transformed[20];\n\n    int f =0;\n\n    int pos =0;\n\n    for (int j=0; j < len; j++) {\n\n        char c = s[len-1 -j]; // the j-th character from the end\n\n        if (!f) {\n\n            if (c == '3') {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '5';\n\n                f=1;\n\n            } else if (c == '5') {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '7';\n\n                f=1;\n\n            } else {\n\n                transformed[pos++] = '3';\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            transformed[pos++] = c;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        transformed[pos++] = '3';\n\n    }\n\n    transformed[pos] = '\\0';\n\n    // reverse transformed to get the next i.\n\n    char reversed[20];\n\n    int len_t = pos;\n\n    for (int k=0; k < len_t; k++) {\n\n        reversed[k] = transformed[len_t -1 -k];\n\n    }\n\n    reversed[len_t] = '\\0';\n\n    return atoll(reversed);\n\n}\n\nint is_prime(long long n) {\n\n    if (n <=1) return 0;\n\n    if (n ==2) return 1;\n\n    if (n%2 ==0) return 0;\n\n    long long sqrt_n = (long long)sqrt(n);\n\n    for (long long i=3; i <= sqrt_n; i +=2) {\n\n        if (n%i ==0) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nlong long find_next_prime(long long x) {\n\n    if (x ==2) return 2;\n\n    if (x%2 ==0) x++;\n\n    while(1) {\n\n        if (is_prime(x)) return x;\n\n        x +=2;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    long long N;\n\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &N);\n\n    long long i = 357;\n\n    int c =0;\n\n    while (i <= N) {\n\n        if (has357(i)) c++;\n\n        i = next_i(i);\n\n    }\n\n    long long x = c;\n\n    long long result = find_next_prime(x);\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but let me check for possible errors.\n\nFirst, in the next_i function:\n\nThe transformed array is declared as char transformed[20], but when appending characters, we need to ensure that the array is large enough. The maximum possible length after processing could be up to the original length plus 1 (if the flag f was never set, so adding a '3'). So for a 19-digit number, the transformed array would need 20 characters (including null). The 20 should be sufficient.\n\nAnother point: when converting the reversed string to a long long, using atoll is correct, but in C, the function is called atoll (for long long). Alternatively, we can use strtoll, but atoll is part of C99.\n\nWait, in C, the function to convert a string to long long is strtoll, but atoll is a macro in C99. Let me confirm:\n\nThe atoll function is part of C99, but not all compilers may have it. Alternatively, use strtoll:\n\nreturn strtoll(reversed, NULL, 10);\n\nSo perhaps better to use that to avoid issues.\n\nSo in next_i function:\n\nreturn strtoll(reversed, NULL, 10);\n\nAlso, in the code, the transformed array's length is pos, and the reversed array is filled correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the transformed string is empty, but since the initial i is 357, and the process appends at least one digit, it should be okay.\n\nTesting the code with the first example:\n\nSuppose N is 357.\n\nThe loop starts with i=357.\n\nCheck has357(357): digits 3,5,7 \u2192 yes \u2192 c becomes 1.\n\nThen compute next_i(357):\n\nThe transformed_str is built as follows:\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is 0 \u2192 not 3 or 5 \u2192 append '3', f remains 0?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the code in next_i:\n\nfor each j from 0 to len-1:\n\nj=0 \u2192 first character is s[len-1 -0] \u2192 last character of s (the original number's last digit).\n\nIn the case of 357, s is \"357\", len=3.\n\nj=0 \u2192 s[2] \u2192 '7'.\n\nProcessing this:\n\nf is 0.\n\nc is '7' \u2192 not 3 or 5 \u2192 append '3' \u2192 transformed[0] = '3', pos=1.\n\nf remains 0.\n\nj=1 \u2192 s[1] \u2192 '5'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nf is 0.\n\nc is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f=1 \u2192 transformed[1] = '7', pos=2.\n\nj=2 \u2192 s[0] \u2192 '3'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nf is now 1 \u2192 append '3' \u2192 transformed[2] = '3', pos=3.\n\nAfter loop, f is 1 \u2192 no appending of '3'.\n\ntransformed is \"373\".\n\nReversed gives \"373\".\n\nThus next_i is 373.\n\nNow, since 373 <= 357? No, because 373>357. So the loop condition i <= N (357) is false. So the loop ends.\n\nThus c is 1.\n\nThen, the second part computes find_next_prime(1).\n\nWait, x is c=1.\n\nfind_next_prime(1):\n\nx starts as 1, which is even? 1%2 is 1, so no. So the code proceeds.\n\nCheck if 1 is prime? is_prime(1) returns 0.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\nx=1 \u2192 is_prime(1) is 0 \u2192 x +=2 \u2192 3.\n\nCheck is_prime(3) \u2192 yes. So returns 3.\n\nThus the output is 3.\n\nBut let's see what the original Java programs would do.\n\nFirst program with N=357:\n\nThe first iteration i=357 is counted (c=1). The next i is 373, which is larger than 357, so loop ends. So c=1.\n\nSecond program with x=1:\n\nThe code checks if x is even and not 2 \u2192 1 is not even, so x remains 1.\n\nThen enters the loop:\n\nCheck if 1 is prime \u2192 no (since is_prime(1) is 0).\n\nThen x +=2 \u2192 3.\n\nCheck if 3 is prime \u2192 yes. So output is 3. Correct.\n\nThus the code works for this case.\n\nAnother test case: N=375.\n\nFirst program:\n\ni starts at 357 \u2192 counted (c=1).\n\nnext_i is 373 \u2192 which is <=375 \u2192 check if it has all three digits.\n\n373 has digits 3,7,3 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 so not counted.\n\nThen next_i(373) is 375.\n\nCheck 375: digits 3,7,5 \u2192 yes \u2192 c becomes 2.\n\nThen next_i(375):\n\nLet's compute next_i(375):\n\ns is \"375\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (5,7,3):\n\nj=0 \u2192 s[2] = '5'.\n\nf is 0 \u2192 '5' \u2192 append '7', set f=1 \u2192 transformed[0] = '7', pos=1.\n\nj=1 \u2192 s[1] = '7' \u2192 f is 1 \u2192 append '7' \u2192 transformed[1] = '7', pos=2.\n\nj=2 \u2192 s[0] = '3' \u2192 f is 1 \u2192 append '3' \u2192 transformed[2] = '3', pos=3.\n\nNo need to append '3' since f is set.\n\ntransformed is \"773\".\n\nReversed \u2192 \"377\".\n\nThus next_i is 377.\n\n377 is <=375? No \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThus c is 2.\n\nThen the second program with x=2:\n\nfind_next_prime(2) \u2192 returns 2.\n\nThus output is 2.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nWait, x is c=2.\n\nThe function find_next_prime(2):\n\nx is 2 \u2192 which is even, but since x ==2 \u2192 returns 2.\n\nThus the output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: N=377.\n\nThe next_i after 375 is 377.\n\nCheck 377: digits 3,7,7 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 not counted. So c remains 2.\n\nThen next_i(377):\n\nProcessing s = \"377\".\n\nReverse order: 7,7,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nj=0 \u2192 '7' \u2192 f is 0 \u2192 append '3' (since not 3 or 5). f remains 0.\n\nj=1 \u2192 '7' \u2192 f is 0 \u2192 append '3' \u2192 f remains 0.\n\nj=2 \u2192 '3' \u2192 f is 0 \u2192 append '5', set f=1.\n\nSo transformed_str is \"3\" (from first j=0) + \"3\" (j=1) + \"5\" (j=2) \u2192 \"335\".\n\nThen, since f is now 1, no extra '3'.\n\nReversing gives \"533\".\n\nThus next_i is 533.\n\n533 is larger than 377 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThus c remains 2.\n\nThus the second program's input is 2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nThus the code works.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nTest case where N is 356 \u2192 then the loop doesn't run (since 357>356), so c=0.\n\nThen the second program's input is 0 \u2192 find_next_prime(0) \u2192 x starts as 0, which is even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 1.\n\nThen check if 1 is prime \u2192 no. Then x becomes 3 \u2192 which is prime. So output is 3.\n\nAnother edge case: N=357 \u2192 as before.\n\nAnother case where the next_i overflows? Probably not, since the problem's constraints are not specified, but the code uses long long which can handle up to 9e18.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
