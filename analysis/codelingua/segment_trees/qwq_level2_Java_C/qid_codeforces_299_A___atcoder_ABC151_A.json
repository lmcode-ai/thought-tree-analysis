Then, proceed to convert to string. Yes. Now, the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int min_val = a[0];\n    bool valid = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n            valid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!valid) {\n        min_val = -1;\n    }\n    char buffer[20];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", min_val);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n    char result_char = first_char + 1;\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in C, the boolean type is in stdbool.h. So I should include that. Also, in the code above, I didn't include it. So adding #include <stdbool.h>. Also, in the code, the loop for checking validity can be written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n        valid = false;\n        break;\n    }\n} Alternatively, since the array is sorted, the first element is the minimum, so all elements must be divisible by it.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_299_A) reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It sorts the array and checks if all elements are divisible by the minimum element (the first element after sorting). If any isn't, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but the code here is a bit more complex. Wait, looking at the code again: the second program's main method reads a line, then outputs the first character plus 1. But the code in the second file's main is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo, for example, if the input is \"a\", it would output 'b'. But the first program's output is either -1 or the minimum value. So the output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nWait, but how do these two Java programs connect? The first program's output is either -1 or the minimum value (a number). Then the second program takes that number as input, but the second program expects a string. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output (a number) must be passed as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read that as a string, take the first character (the '5'), add 1 to its ASCII value (which is 53 +1 =54, which is '6'), so output '6'.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is written to read a line, then take the first character of that line. So the input to the second program is the output of the first program. So the first program's output is a number (either -1 or the minimum), which is a string. So the second program will take that string, take its first character, add 1, and output that.\n\nSo the overall process is: input to first program is n followed by array elements. The first program outputs a number (min or -1). The second program takes that number as a string input, processes it as per its code, and outputs the first character plus 1.\n\nNow, the task is to combine these into a single C program that does the same steps without I/O in between. So the C program must read the input (the first program's input), process both steps, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps in C would be:\n\n1. Read n and the array from input.\n\n2. Process the first step (sort array, check divisibility by min, compute min or -1).\n\n3. Then, take that result (the min or -1) and process it as the input to the second step.\n\nWait, but the second step's input is a string. So the first step's output is a number, which in the original setup is printed as a string. So in the C program, the intermediate value is the number (either -1 or min). Then, the second step's input is the string representation of that number. So the second step's processing is to take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the first step's result (min or -1), we need to convert that number to a string, then take the first character of that string, add 1, and output that.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let's think through examples.\n\nSuppose the first program outputs \"5\". Then the second program's input is \"5\", so the first character is '5' (ASCII 53), adding 1 gives 54 which is '6', so output '6'.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"-1\", then the input to the second program is \"-1\", so the first character is '-', which when added 1 becomes '.' (ASCII 45 +1 =46). So the output would be '.'.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is written to read a line, then take the first character. So if the first program outputs \"-1\", the second program's input is the string \"-1\", so the first character is '-', so the output is '.'.\n\nSo in the C program, after computing the first step's result (min or -1), we need to convert that integer to a string, then process the first character of that string as per the second step.\n\nTherefore, the steps in C are:\n\n- Read n and array.\n\n- Compute the first step's result (min or -1).\n\n- Convert that result to a string.\n\n- Take the first character of that string, add 1, and output that as a character.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nRead n, then n integers. Sort the array, check if all elements are divisible by the first element (since sorted). If any isn't, set result to -1, else the first element.\n\nThen, the second part: take that result, convert to a string, then process.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nWe can do the following steps:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n\n2. Read n integers into an array.\n\n3. Sort the array (using qsort).\n\n4. Check if all elements are divisible by the first element (a[0]). If any isn't, set min_val to -1. Else, min_val is a[0].\n\n5. Now, convert min_val to a string. Let's say we can use sprintf to write it into a buffer.\n\n6. Take the first character of that string, add 1, then print it as a character.\n\nWait, but in C, how to handle the conversion. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if min_val is 5, then converting to a string gives \"5\", so first character is '5', add 1 gives '6'.\n\nIf min_val is -1, then the string is \"-1\", so first character is '-', adding 1 gives '.'.\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in C.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Function to compare integers for qsort\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int min_val = a[0];\n    bool valid = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n            valid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!valid) {\n        min_val = -1;\n    }\n    // Now process the second step\n    char buffer[20]; // enough to hold any integer\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", min_val);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n    char result_char = first_char + 1;\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but let me check edge cases.\n\nCase 1: min_val is 0. Wait, but in the first Java code, the array is sorted, so the first element is the minimum. But if the array has 0, then all elements must be divisible by 0, which is impossible except if all elements are 0. Wait, but division by zero is undefined. Wait, in the original Java code, if the minimum is 0, then when checking a[i] % min_val, that would be division by zero. So in the Java code, that would cause an error. But in the problem's context, perhaps the input ensures that the minimum is not zero? Or maybe the code is written in a way that if the minimum is zero, then the code would crash. But the problem's code as given would have a division by zero if the minimum is zero. So perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the minimum is positive. But in the C code, we need to handle that.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, if the first element is 0, then when checking a[i] % 0, that would throw an exception. But in the code provided, the code would crash. However, the problem's code as given may not handle that. So perhaps the problem expects that the minimum is positive. So in the C code, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the minimum is positive, so that division is okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first program would output -1 in that case. Let me think: if the minimum is zero, then for any a[i], a[i] % 0 is undefined. So in Java, that would throw an exception. But in the code given, the code would crash. So perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such cases, so the code can proceed as written.\n\nIn the C code, when min_val is 0, then the code would proceed to check a[i] % 0, which is undefined behavior. So to replicate the Java code's behavior, perhaps we need to handle that case.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, if the minimum is zero, then the first element is zero, so the array has at least one zero. Then, for the other elements, when checking if they are divisible by zero, the modulo operation would throw an ArithmeticException. So the code would crash. But the problem's code as given would not handle that. So perhaps the problem expects that the input has a minimum that is positive. So in the C code, perhaps we can proceed as written, but in the case where min_val is zero, the code would have undefined behavior. But since the problem's code would crash in that case, perhaps the C code should also crash, but the problem may not have such test cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first program would output -1 in that case. Let me see: if the minimum is zero, then the first element is zero. Then, for the other elements, when checking a[i] % 0, which is division by zero, so the code would throw an exception. So the code would not reach the print statement. So the program would not output anything. But in the problem's code, perhaps the input ensures that the minimum is positive. So in the C code, perhaps we can proceed as written.\n\nSo proceeding with the code as above.\n\nAnother edge case: when the first program outputs -1. Then the second step's input is \"-1\", so first character is '-', adding 1 gives '.'.\n\nAnother case: if the first program outputs 0 (if allowed), then the second step's input is \"0\", so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nWait, but in the first program, if the minimum is zero, then the code would crash. So in the C code, when min_val is zero, the code would have a division by zero in the loop. So to avoid that, perhaps we need to handle that case.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter sorting, min_val is a[0]. Then, for each element in a, check if a[i] % min_val is zero. So if min_val is zero, then the modulo operation is undefined. So in C, that would be undefined behavior. To replicate the Java code's behavior, perhaps we need to handle that case.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, if the minimum is zero, then the code would crash. So in the C code, perhaps we should also crash, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the minimum is positive, so we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first program would output -1 in that case. Let me think: if the minimum is zero, then the first element is zero. Then, for the other elements, when checking a[i] % 0, which is division by zero, so the code would throw an exception, so the program would not reach the print statement. So the output would be nothing, but the problem's code would crash. So perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such inputs, so the code can proceed as written.\n\nTherefore, the code as written should be okay.\n\nNow, let's check the second Java program's code again. The second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC151_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in), 1);\n        String s;\n        String sl[];\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the code has some unused variables (sl), but that's okay. The code reads a line, then takes the first character of that line, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that as a character.\n\nSo in the C code, after converting the first program's result to a string, we take the first character of that string, add 1, and print it. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the C code, when converting the integer to a string, the buffer must be large enough. For example, the maximum integer in C is up to 2^31-1, which is 10 digits. So a buffer of 20 is sufficient.\n\nTesting the code with some examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3\n\n4 8 12\n\nThe first program sorts to [4,8,12], all divisible by 4. So min_val is 4. The second step converts to \"4\", first character '4' (ASCII 52), add 1 gives 53 which is '5'. So output is '5'.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n2\n\n3 5\n\nThe array is [3,5]. 5 mod 3 is 2, so not divisible. So first program outputs -1. The second step's input is \"-1\", first character '-', adding 1 gives '.' (ASCII 46). So output is '.'.\n\nAnother example where first program outputs 0 (if allowed):\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n0\n\nThen the array is [0]. The check is 0 mod 0, which is undefined. So in C, the code would crash. But if we proceed, the code would have min_val 0, then the second step's string is \"0\", so first character '0' (48) +1 is '1'.\n\nBut in reality, the first program would crash here, so the C code would also crash. So perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such inputs.\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs 100:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n100 200 300\n\nThe first program outputs 100. The second step's input is \"100\", first character '1', adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nSo the code would output '2'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together into the C code.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, after checking validity, if not valid, set min_val to -1. Then, proceed to convert to string.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int min_val = a[0];\n    bool valid = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n            valid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!valid) {\n        min_val = -1;\n    }\n    char buffer[20];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", min_val);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n    char result_char = first_char + 1;\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the boolean type is in stdbool.h. So I should include that. Also, in the code above, I didn't include it. So adding #include <stdbool.h>.\n\nAlso, in the code, the loop for checking validity can be written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n        valid = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, the first element is the minimum, so all elements must be divisible by it. So the loop can start from the second element, but the code as written is okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the case where min_val is 0, the modulo operation would be undefined. So in the code, if the first element is 0, then the code would crash. But the problem's original code would also crash. So the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nThus, the final C code should be as above, with the necessary includes.\n\nWait, also, in the code, the 'bool' type is used, so need to include stdbool.h.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nSo the full code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int min_val = a[0];\n    bool valid = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n            valid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!valid) {\n        min_val = -1;\n    }\n    char buffer[20];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", min_val);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n    char result_char = first_char + 1;\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the code uses BufferedReader with a buffer size of 1. But in the C code, the input is read via scanf, which is okay because the first program's output is a single line (either a number or -1). The second program in Java reads the entire line, so the C code's conversion to a string via sprintf ensures that the entire number is in the buffer, so the first character is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the second Java program, the code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which outputs the character without a newline. The C code uses printf(\"%c\\n\", ...), which adds a newline. Wait, but in the original Java code, the second program's output is a single character followed by a newline? Let me check the Java code:\n\nThe second program's code has System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0)+1); which outputs the character without a newline. So the C code should also not add a newline. Wait, the Java code's print statement is System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) which does not add a newline. So the C code's printf should be without the \\n.\n\nAh, that's a mistake in the code I wrote. The C code currently has a \\n, but the Java code does not. So the output should be just the character, not followed by a newline.\n\nSo the C code's last line should be:\n\nprintf(\"%c\", result_char);\n\nWithout the \\n.\n\nSo correcting that.\n\nSo the final code's last lines:\n\n    printf(\"%c\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n    int min_val = a[0];\n    bool valid = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % min_val != 0) {\n            valid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!valid) {\n        min_val = -1;\n    }\n    char buffer[20];\n    sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", min_val);\n    char first_char = buffer[0];\n    char result_char = first_char + 1;\n    printf(\"%c\", result_char);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThat's better.\n\nTesting again with the first example where the first program outputs 4, the second step's output is '5' (without a newline).\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs -1, the second step outputs '.' (without a newline).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be correct."
