Wait, the key for the dp is (base + a[i] ) mod m. Wait, no, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m, but base is updated before this step. Wait, let me re-express the algorithm step by step for each a[i]:\n\nAt step i:\n\n1. Compute rem = a[i] mod m (adjusted to 0..m-1). 2. Update base to (base - rem) mod m. (since (base - rem + m) % m)\n\n3. Compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m. Since a[i] mod m is rem, this is (base + rem) mod m.\n\nWait, but base is (base_prev - rem) mod m. So base + rem mod m is (base_prev - rem + rem) mod m = base_prev mod m. So key is base_prev mod m? Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote base_prev as the base before step 2. After step 2, base becomes (base_prev - rem) mod m.\n\nThen, key = (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\nBut a[i] mod m is rem, so a[i] = k*m + rem. So a[i] mod m is rem. Thus, (base + a[i]) mod m = (base + rem) mod m.\n\nBut base is (base_prev - rem) mod m. So substituting:\n\n(base_prev - rem + rem) mod m = base_prev mod m. So key is base_prev mod m.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! So the key is equal to the previous base (base_prev) mod m.\n\nWait, let me verify with an example:\n\nSuppose base_prev is 5, rem is 3, m is 7. Then base becomes (5-3) mod7 = 2 mod7 =2. Then key is (2 + a[i]) mod7. But a[i] mod7 is 3, so a[i] = 3 + 7k. So (2 +3) mod7 =5 mod7 =5, which is the previous base (5 mod7). Yes! So key is equal to the previous base (base_prev) mod m. Therefore, the key is the previous base (before the update)",

Because the base was just updated in the previous line. Wait, but then the next line is ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). Hmm, so the process is: For each a[i], first update base to (base - a[i]%m) mod m (with the +m to handle negatives). Then, we add an entry to the dp map for the key (base + a[i]) mod m. The value is incremented by 1. Then, we add to ans the current count of the key 'base' in the dp map. Wait, but the order here is important. Because when we process a[i], the current base is the new base (after the subtraction). The key for the merge is (base + a[i]) mod m. But the merge is adding 1 to that key's count. Then, the ans is increased by the count of the current base in the dp map. Wait, but the way the code is written, the merge is done before the ans += dp.get(base). So the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is the new base plus a[i], mod m. But the ans is getting the count of the current base (the new base) in the dp map before any of the current step's changes? Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe steps for each i:\n\n1. Update base to new value (base - a[i]%m mod m). 2. Then, compute (base + a[i]) mod m. Let's call this key. 3. Then, in the dp map, we merge the key with 1. So, if the key was already present, its count increases by 1. If not, it's set to 1.\n\n4. Then, ans += the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp map. But wait, the dp map's count for the base (the new base) is before the current step's merge? Or after?\n\nWait, the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is a different key.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC105_D). It reads input from stdin, processes it using some algorithm involving a HashMap and some modulo operations, and outputs the result. The second Java file (codeforces_622_A) reads input again, but in this case, it's using a Scanner and PrintWriter. Wait, but the problem says that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output is the input for the second. But in the given Java code, each program is standalone, so maybe the user is supposed to run them in sequence, with the first's output being the input to the second. But the user wants a single C program that does the same as the sequence. So the C program must first run the first Java program's logic, then take its output as input to the second's logic, but all in one C program without I/O in between.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the C program must first process the input through the first algorithm, then take that result and process it through the second algorithm, and output the final result. So the C program must read the initial input, run the first algorithm, then run the second algorithm on the first's output, and then output the second's result.\n\nWait, but looking at the first Java program's code, the first program's output is the 'ans' variable, which is printed. The second program's input is a single long (position) read via sc.nextLong(). So the first program's output is a number, which is the input to the second program. So the C program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as the input to the second's algorithm, then output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, m, a array).\n2. Compute the first program's answer (ans).\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's algorithm (the position variable).\n4. Compute the second program's answer and print it.\n\nSo the C program must combine both algorithms into one, with the first's output feeding into the second's input, without any I/O in between.\n\nNow, let's look at the first Java program's code in detail.\n\nFirst Java program (TaskD's solve method):\n\n- Reads n and m, then an array a of n integers.\n- Then, it uses a HashMap (dp) to track counts. The algorithm is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe variables:\n\nbase starts at 0.\n\nLoop over each a[i]:\n\nbase is updated as (base - a[i] % m + m) % m. Wait, that's equivalent to (base - (a[i] % m)) mod m. Because subtracting a[i]%m from base, then mod m. But adding m before mod ensures it's positive.\n\nWait, the expression (base - a[i]%m + m) % m is the same as (base - (a[i] % m)) % m, but adding m before mod to avoid negative numbers. So effectively, base is being updated by subtracting a[i] mod m, modulo m.\n\nThen, the next line is:\n\ndp.merge( (base + a[i]) % m, 1, Integer::sum );\n\nWait, merge in HashMap: the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. The value is 1, and the merge function adds 1 to the existing value if the key exists. So this is equivalent to incrementing the count for that key.\n\nThen, ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). \n\nWait, the order here is important. Let me think step by step:\n\nAt each step i:\n\n1. Update base: base = (base - (a[i] % m)) mod m.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is base = (base - (a[i] % m) + m) % m. So that ensures it's positive.\n\nWait, the original code is:\n\nbase = (base - a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\nYes. So that's the new base.\n\nThen, the next step is to compute (base + a[i]) mod m, and merge into the dp map. The key here is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but base is the updated value here? Or the previous base?\n\nWait, the order is:\n\nFirst, compute the new base (after subtracting a[i]%m mod m). Then, the key for the merge is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, but base has already been updated here. Wait, no, let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nbase = (base - a[i]%m + m) % m;\n\nThen, the next line is:\n\ndp.merge( (base + a[i]) % m, 1, Integer::sum );\n\nWait, so the key is (base + a[i]) mod m, where base is the new value after the update. Because the base was just updated in the previous line.\n\nWait, but then the next line is ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). \n\nHmm, so the process is:\n\nFor each a[i], first update base to (base - a[i]%m) mod m (with the +m to handle negatives).\n\nThen, we add an entry to the dp map for the key (base + a[i]) mod m. The value is incremented by 1.\n\nThen, we add to ans the current count of the key 'base' in the dp map.\n\nWait, but the order here is important. Because when we process a[i], the current base is the new base (after the subtraction). The key for the merge is (base + a[i]) mod m. But the merge is adding 1 to that key's count. Then, the ans is increased by the count of the current base in the dp map.\n\nWait, but the way the code is written, the merge is done before the ans += dp.get(base). So the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is the new base plus a[i], mod m. But the ans is getting the count of the current base (the new base) in the dp map before any of the current step's changes?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe steps for each i:\n\n1. Update base to new value (base - a[i]%m mod m).\n\n2. Then, compute (base + a[i]) mod m. Let's call this key.\n\n3. Then, in the dp map, we merge the key with 1. So, if the key was already present, its count increases by 1. If not, it's set to 1.\n\n4. Then, ans += the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp map. But wait, the dp map's count for the base (the new base) is before the current step's merge? Or after?\n\nWait, the merge is for the key (base + a[i]) mod m, which is a different key. The ans is adding the count of the current base (the new base) in the dp map. But the dp map hasn't been updated with the current base yet. Wait, no. The merge is for a different key. So the count of the current base (the new base) in the dp map is whatever was there before this iteration. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is that the dp map is tracking the number of times a certain value has been seen before. Let me think of the algorithm's purpose. The problem is probably related to finding the number of pairs (i,j) such that some condition holds. The code is using a dynamic programming approach with a hash map to track counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the classic problem where you want the number of subarrays with sum divisible by m. But I'm not sure. Anyway, the code's logic is as written.\n\nNow, the second Java program (codeforces_622_A):\n\nThe solve method reads a long 'position', then finds the nearest sequence start index, and calculates the answer based on that.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. So for index=1, it's 1. index=2: 1 + (1*2)/2 = 2. index=3: 1 + (2*3)/2 = 4, etc. So the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, etc. Each term is the previous term plus the index. Wait, let's see:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(1) = 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(3) = 1 + (3-1)*3/2 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(4) = 1 + (4-1)*4/2 = 1 + 6 =7.\n\nYes, so the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, etc. Each term is the previous term plus the current index. So the nth term is 1 + sum_{k=1 to n-1} (k+1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is the triangular numbers plus 1? Let me see:\n\nTriangular numbers are T(n) = n(n+1)/2. But here, for index n, the value is 1 + (n-1)*n/2. So that's 1 + T(n-1). So the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, etc.\n\nThe problem is to find, given a position, which term of the sequence it falls into, and then compute its position within that term's block.\n\nThe solve method uses a binary search approach. The first loop finds the largest power of two (nrstSeqStartIndx) such that the value at 2*nrstSeqStartIndx is less than the position. Then, it increments until the next term is beyond the position. Finally, the start index is the value at nrstSeqStartIndx, and the answer is (position - start) +1.\n\nSo the second program's input is a single long (position), and it outputs the position's rank in its block.\n\nNow, the C program must first compute the first program's output (ans) given the input n, m, a array, then use that ans as the position input to the second program's algorithm, then output the result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, then n integers (the a array).\n\n2. Compute the first program's ans using the algorithm described.\n\n3. Use that ans as the position in the second program's algorithm.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result and print it.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program's algorithm into C.\n\nFirst, the first part's algorithm:\n\nVariables:\n\n- n, m, a array of n elements.\n\n- dp is a hash map. In C, since we can't use a hash map, we need an array or some other structure. Since the modulo m is involved, the possible keys are from 0 to m-1. Wait, because all keys in the dp are modulo m. So the maximum possible key is m-1. Therefore, instead of a hash map, we can use an array of size m, where each index represents the key, and the value is the count.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Since all keys in the dp are modulo m, the possible keys are 0 to m-1. So instead of a hash map, we can use an array of size m. That would be more efficient and easier to implement in C.\n\nSo, in C, we can have an array dp of size m, initialized to 0. Then, for each step, we can compute the key as (base + a[i]) % m, and increment dp[key] by 1. But wait, the merge in Java is equivalent to dp[key] += 1. So yes, an array is sufficient here.\n\nWait, let me re-express the first algorithm in terms of an array:\n\nInitialize dp as an array of size m, all zeros.\n\nInitialize base = 0, ans = 0.\n\nLoop over each a[i] in the array:\n\n1. Compute current a_i mod m: rem = a[i] % m. But since a[i] can be negative? Wait, in Java, the % operator returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. But in the code, when they do a[i]%m, since m is positive, the remainder can be negative if a[i] is negative. However, in the problem's context, perhaps the a array elements are non-negative? The problem isn't specified here, but in the code, the first program's input is read as integers, so they could be negative. But in the code, the first program's code uses (base - a[i]%m + m) % m to ensure base is mod m. So in C, we need to handle that.\n\nWait, in C, the % operator behaves differently for negative numbers. So to compute a[i] mod m correctly (so that the remainder is in [0, m)), we can do:\n\nrem = a[i] % m;\n\nif (rem <0) rem += m;\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute it as (a[i] % m + m) % m. That way, even if a[i] is negative, the result is in 0 to m-1.\n\nWait, in Java, the % operator returns a remainder with the same sign as the dividend. So for example, -1 % 3 is -1. So in the code, when they do a[i]%m, they might get a negative remainder. Hence, in the code, the (base - a[i]%m + m) % m ensures that the subtraction doesn't go negative. So in C, to replicate that, we need to compute the remainder properly.\n\nSo in C, for each a[i], compute rem = a[i] % m. If rem is negative, add m to make it positive. So rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint rem = a[i] % m;\n\nif (rem <0) rem += m;\n\nAlternatively, rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\nEither way.\n\nSo, proceeding with the algorithm:\n\nInitialize dp array of size m, all zeros.\n\nbase starts at 0.\n\nans is 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n1. Compute rem = a[i] % m, adjusted to be in 0..m-1.\n\n2. base = (base - rem + m) % m; // because (base - rem) could be negative, so adding m before mod.\n\nWait, in Java, the code is:\n\nbase = (base - a[i]%m + m) % m;\n\nSo in C, same steps.\n\n3. Then, compute the key for the dp array: key = (base + a[i]) % m. Wait, but a[i] can be large, but mod m again?\n\nWait, (base + a[i]) mod m. Since base is mod m, and a[i] mod m is rem, so (base + a[i]) mod m is (base + rem) mod m. Because a[i] = k*m + rem, so a[i] mod m is rem. So (base + a[i]) mod m = (base + rem) mod m. But since base is already mod m, adding rem (mod m) and mod m again is redundant. So key can be (base + rem) % m.\n\nWait, but in the code, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Since a[i] mod m is rem, so a[i] = m * q + rem. So (base + a[i]) mod m = (base + rem) mod m. So yes, same as (base + rem) mod m. So perhaps it's better to compute it as (base + rem) % m.\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's easier to compute (base + a[i]) % m, but since a[i] can be big, but mod m is same as rem.\n\nEither way, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\nThen, we need to increment dp[key] by 1. But since this is done via merge in Java, which adds 1 to the existing value, so in C, dp[key] +=1.\n\nThen, after updating the dp array, we add to ans the current value of dp[base]. Wait, no, the code in Java is ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). But the base here is the new base (after step 2). Wait, but before the merge step? Or after?\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\ndp.merge( (base + a[i]) % m, 1, Integer::sum );\n\nThen, ans += dp.get(base, 0).\n\nWait, the order is: first, the merge (which updates the dp for the key (base + a[i]) mod m), then the ans is increased by the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp.\n\nWait, but the merge is for a different key. The key for the merge is (base + a[i]) mod m, which is different from the base. So the count of the base in the dp is not affected by the merge. So the ans is adding the current count of the base in the dp before this iteration's merge.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value after step 2. So the dp[base] is whatever it was before this iteration. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose before this iteration, the dp array has some counts. Then, in this iteration:\n\n- compute rem, update base to new value.\n\n- compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\n- increment dp[key] by 1.\n\n- then, add dp[base] to ans.\n\nAh, so the ans is adding the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp array, which is before the current iteration's merge (since the merge is for key, not base). So the count of the base in the dp array is whatever it was before this iteration's steps. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So the dp[base] could have been modified in previous steps, but not in this step's merge. So the ans is adding the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp array before this iteration's merge.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So the count of the base in the dp array is whatever it was before this iteration's steps. Because the merge is for a different key.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each a[i]:\n\n1. Update base to (base - rem + m) % m.\n\n2. Compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\n3. dp[key] +=1.\n\n4. ans += dp[base].\n\nWait, but the order is important. The ans is adding the current dp[base], which is before the current iteration's merge (step 3). Because the merge is for key, not base. So the dp[base] hasn't been modified in this iteration yet.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So the dp[base] could have been modified in previous steps, but not in this step's merge. So the ans is adding the current count of the base (the new base) in the dp array before this iteration's steps.\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So the dp[base] could have been set in previous steps. For example, in previous iterations, when the base was some other value, but now the new base is a value that was a key in previous steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps the algorithm is designed such that the ans accumulates the count of the current base (the new base) in the dp array before this iteration's steps. Because the merge in step 3 is for a different key.\n\nTherefore, the steps in C would be:\n\nInitialize dp array of size m, all zeros.\n\nbase = 0, ans =0.\n\nfor each a[i] in the array:\n\n    rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m; // to get 0..m-1\n\n    base = (base - rem + m) % m; // because (base - rem) could be negative.\n\n    key = (base + a[i]) % m; // or (base + rem) % m, since a[i] mod m is rem.\n\n    // but (base + a[i]) mod m is same as (base + rem) mod m.\n\n    // so key can be (base + rem) % m.\n\n    // but since a[i] can be big, but mod m is same as rem, so either way.\n\n    dp[key] +=1;\n\n    ans += dp[base]; // because dp[base] is the count before this iteration's merge (since the merge is for key, not base).\n\nWait, but in the code, the order is:\n\nAfter updating base, compute key, then merge (which is dp[key] +=1), then add dp.get(base, 0) to ans.\n\nYes, so in C, after updating base, compute key, then increment dp[key], then add dp[base] to ans.\n\nWait, but in the code, the ans is added after the merge. Because the merge is for the key, so the dp[base] hasn't been modified here. So the ans is adding the current count of the base in the dp array before this iteration's steps (except for previous steps).\n\nWait, but the base is the new value. So the dp[base] could have been set in previous steps. For example, in a previous iteration, when the key was equal to the current base, then dp[base] would have been incremented.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, in C, the steps are manageable.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem: the second Java program's algorithm.\n\nThe second program's solve function:\n\nReads a long 'position', then finds the nearest sequence start index.\n\nThe code uses a loop to find the largest power of two (nrstSeqStartIndx) such that getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position.\n\nThen, it increments nrstSeqStartIndx until getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) > position.\n\nFinally, the start is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the answer is (position - start) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo in C, we can compute that as (1 + (index-1)*index/2).\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in C.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\nGiven position (which is the ans from the first part), compute the answer as follows:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx =1.\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *=2;\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx +=1;\n\nThen, start = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx);\n\nans = (position - start) +1;\n\nSo in C, this can be implemented with loops.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe C program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, then n integers into an array.\n\n2. Compute the first part's ans.\n\n3. Use that ans as the position for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's answer and print it.\n\nNow, let's think about the data types.\n\nIn the first part, the a array can be up to n elements. n can be up to... the problem's constraints aren't given, but in the Java code, it's using int arrays, so n is up to 1e5 or something. But in C, we can read as int.\n\nThe ans in the first part can be up to n*(n) (since each step adds up to the current dp[base], which could be up to n). So for n up to 1e5, ans can be up to 1e10, which fits in a long long (since in C, long long is 64 bits).\n\nThe second part's position is this ans, which can be up to 1e10, so in C, we can use long long for position.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function for index up to, say, 1e5 would be okay, but for large position, the index could be up to sqrt(2*position), which for 1e10 would be about 1e5, so manageable.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read n integers into an array a.\n\nThen compute the first part's ans.\n\nInitialize dp array of size m. But wait, m can be up to... the problem's constraints? The first Java code uses int for m, so m can be up to 1e9? But in the first part's algorithm, the dp array's size is m, so if m is large (like 1e9), this would be impossible in C. Wait, but in the first Java code, the problem might have constraints on m. For example, in the problem ABC105 D, the constraints are probably m up to 1e9, but then the code would not work because the hash map would be too big. Wait, but in the Java code, the problem's constraints must have m not too big, or the code would be too slow. Wait, perhaps the problem's constraints for m are small. Wait, looking at the problem's name (ABC105 D), which is an AtCoder problem. Let me check the actual problem.\n\nWait, the first Java code is for AtCoder ABC105 D. Let me recall that problem's constraints. The problem is \"Maximum Multiple\". The constraints are n up to 1e5, m up to 1e9. So m can be up to 1e9, which would make the array approach impossible in C, as the array would be too big (1e9 elements). Oh, that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. The first Java code uses a HashMap, which can handle keys up to m-1, but if m is up to 1e9, then an array of size m is impossible in C. So the array approach won't work here. So I need to find another way.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that in the first Java code, the dp is a HashMap, which can handle keys from 0 to m-1, but if m is large (like 1e9), then using an array is impossible. So in C, we need to find an alternative.\n\nWait, but in the problem's constraints for ABC105 D, perhaps m is up to 1e5 or something? Let me check the actual problem's constraints.\n\nLooking up ABC105 D's problem statement:\n\nProblem D: Maximum Multiple\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1e5\n\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 1e9\n\n1 \u2264 A_i \u2264 1e9\n\nAh, so m can be up to 1e9, so the array approach is impossible. So we need to find another way.\n\nHmm, so the original Java code uses a HashMap, which can handle keys up to m-1, but in C, we can't use a hash map. So how can we implement this in C?\n\nAlternative idea: since the keys are modulo m, but m can be up to 1e9, we need a hash table. But in C, we can use a hash table with a struct and a linked list, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased to use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm can be re-expressed in a way that doesn't require a hash map. Let me think again about the algorithm.\n\nThe first part's algorithm:\n\nThe variables:\n\nbase starts at 0.\n\nans is 0.\n\ndp is a map that counts the number of times a certain value has been seen.\n\nWait, the key for the dp is (base + a[i]) mod m. Wait, no, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m, but base is updated before this step.\n\nWait, let me re-express the algorithm step by step for each a[i]:\n\nAt step i:\n\n1. Compute rem = a[i] mod m (adjusted to 0..m-1).\n\n2. Update base to (base - rem) mod m. (since (base - rem + m) % m)\n\n3. Compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m. Since a[i] mod m is rem, this is (base + rem) mod m.\n\nWait, but base is (base_prev - rem) mod m. So base + rem mod m is (base_prev - rem + rem) mod m = base_prev mod m. So key is base_prev mod m?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote base_prev as the base before step 2.\n\nAfter step 2, base becomes (base_prev - rem) mod m.\n\nThen, key = (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\nBut a[i] mod m is rem, so a[i] = k*m + rem. So a[i] mod m is rem.\n\nThus, (base + a[i]) mod m = (base + rem) mod m.\n\nBut base is (base_prev - rem) mod m. So substituting:\n\n(base_prev - rem + rem) mod m = base_prev mod m.\n\nSo key is base_prev mod m.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! So the key is equal to the previous base (base_prev) mod m.\n\nWait, let me verify with an example:\n\nSuppose base_prev is 5, rem is 3, m is 7.\n\nThen base becomes (5-3) mod7 = 2 mod7 =2.\n\nThen key is (2 + a[i]) mod7. But a[i] mod7 is 3, so a[i] = 3 + 7k. So (2 +3) mod7 =5 mod7 =5, which is the previous base (5 mod7).\n\nYes! So key is equal to the previous base (base_prev) mod m.\n\nTherefore, the key is the previous base (before the update) mod m.\n\nWait, so the key is base_prev mod m. Because base_prev is already mod m (since it's updated in each step with mod m). So key is exactly base_prev.\n\nWait, because base_prev is already mod m. So key is base_prev.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nbase_prev is the base before step 2. Since in each step, base is updated to (base_prev - rem) mod m, which is mod m. So base_prev is mod m.\n\nThus, key = (base + a[i]) mod m = ( (base_prev - rem) mod m + a[i] ) mod m.\n\nBut a[i] mod m is rem, so a[i] = m*k + rem. So:\n\n(base_prev - rem + m*k + rem) mod m = (base_prev + m*k) mod m = base_prev mod m = base_prev.\n\nWait, so key is base_prev mod m, which is base_prev, since it's already mod m.\n\nTherefore, key is exactly base_prev.\n\nTherefore, the key for the merge is the previous base (base_prev).\n\nSo the key is the previous base (before the update in step 2).\n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be rephrased as:\n\nFor each a[i]:\n\n1. Compute rem = a[i] mod m (adjusted to 0..m-1).\n\n2. base_prev = base.\n\n3. base = (base_prev - rem) mod m.\n\n4. key = base_prev.\n\n5. dp[key] +=1.\n\n6. ans += dp[base].\n\nWait, because step 5 is incrementing dp[key], which is base_prev.\n\nThen, step 6 adds dp[base], which is the current base (the new base) in the dp array.\n\nWait, but the dp array here is tracking the count of the previous base (base_prev) in the dp array. Wait, no, the dp array counts how many times each key (base_prev) has been encountered.\n\nWait, let me re-express the algorithm with this insight:\n\nThe key for the merge is the previous base (base_prev). So each time, we are incrementing the count of the previous base (base_prev) in the dp map.\n\nThen, the ans is adding the current count of the new base (base) in the dp map.\n\nWait, but the new base is the current base after step 2. So the ans is adding the count of the current base (base) in the dp map, which is the count of how many times the current base has been a previous base in previous steps.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing, but the key point is that the key for the merge is the previous base (base_prev), and the ans is adding the current count of the new base (base) in the dp map.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be rephrased as:\n\nInitialize dp as a map (or array) that counts occurrences of previous bases.\n\nInitialize base =0, ans=0.\n\nFor each a[i]:\n\n    rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\n    base_prev = base;\n\n    base = (base_prev - rem + m) % m; // mod m.\n\n    // key is base_prev.\n\n    dp[base_prev] +=1;\n\n    ans += dp[base]; // the current count of the new base in the dp map.\n\nWait, but the dp[base] is the count of how many times the current base (new base) has been a previous base in previous steps.\n\nYes, because whenever a previous base was equal to the current base, that would have been counted in dp[base].\n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be implemented with a hash map that tracks the count of each previous base.\n\nBut in C, with m up to 1e9, we can't use an array. So we need a hash map.\n\nHmm, but in C, implementing a hash map is possible with a struct and linked lists, but it's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a hash table with a dynamic array and some collision handling, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased to use a frequency array, but only for the possible values of base, which might be limited.\n\nWait, the base is updated each step as (base_prev - rem) mod m. The possible values of base are between 0 and m-1. So the number of possible keys in the dp map is m. But if m is up to 1e9, this is impossible.\n\nHmm, so this is a problem. The original Java code uses a HashMap, which can handle this, but in C, we need an alternative.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the current base and the counts, but without needing to track all possible keys.\n\nWait, let's think of the algorithm again.\n\nThe ans is the sum over all i of dp[base_i], where base_i is the base after processing a[i].\n\nWait, but the dp array counts the number of times each previous base (base_prev) has been encountered.\n\nWait, the ans is the sum for each step of the count of the current base (base_i) in the dp map.\n\nThe current base_i is the base after processing a[i].\n\nThe dp map's count for base_i is the number of times base_i has been a previous base in previous steps.\n\nWait, so for each step i, the ans increases by the number of times the current base (base_i) has been a previous base in any of the previous steps.\n\nWait, but the current base_i is the base after the update. The previous bases are the base_prev of each step.\n\nSo the count of base_i in the dp map is the number of times base_i was a previous base in any of the previous steps.\n\nTherefore, the ans is the total number of pairs (j, i) where j < i and the previous base of step j is equal to the current base of step i.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to compute this without a hash map, but I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the current base and the counts, but using a hash map in C.\n\nIn C, we can implement a hash map using a linked list or a dynamic array with a hash function. But for large m, this could be slow, but given the constraints of n up to 1e5, it might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a hash table with a struct and a hash function. Let me think of how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased to use a frequency array, but only for the current possible bases. Since the base is mod m, but m can be up to 1e9, but the base can only take values from 0 to m-1. However, storing an array of size m is impossible for large m.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the only way is to implement a hash map in C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased to use a different approach.\n\nWait, let me think again about the algorithm's purpose. The problem is to find the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j such that (a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{i} ) mod m == (a_0 + ... + a_j) mod m. Or something like that. Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding the number of subarrays with sum divisible by m. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's algorithm is counting the number of times a certain value has been seen before, which is the classic approach for such problems.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to count the number of pairs (i,j) where the sum from a_i to a_j is divisible by m. The algorithm here uses a prefix sum approach.\n\nWait, let me think of the variables:\n\nLet me denote S_i as the sum of the first i elements mod m.\n\nWait, but the algorithm's variables are a bit different. Let me see:\n\nThe base variable is being updated as base = (base - a[i]%m) mod m.\n\nWait, perhaps the base is the negative of the prefix sum mod m?\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose we have a prefix sum P_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{i} mod m.\n\nWait, but the base is being updated as base = (base - rem) mod m, where rem is a[i] mod m.\n\nSo starting with base =0:\n\nAfter first element a_0:\n\nbase becomes (0 - rem0) mod m = (-rem0 mod m).\n\nAfter second element a_1:\n\nbase becomes ( (-rem0 mod m) - rem1 ) mod m = (- (rem0 + rem1) mod m).\n\nSo after i steps, base is equal to (- (sum_{k=0 to i-1} rem_k) ) mod m.\n\nWait, because each step subtracts the current rem from the previous base.\n\nSo base_i = (base_{i-1} - rem_i) mod m.\n\nStarting from base_0 =0:\n\nbase_1 = (0 - rem0) mod m = (-rem0 mod m).\n\nbase_2 = (base_1 - rem1) mod m = (-rem0 - rem1) mod m.\n\nSo after i steps, base_i = (- sum_{k=0 to i-1} rem_k) mod m.\n\nHmm, so the base is the negative of the prefix sum mod m.\n\nNow, the key for the merge is base_prev (the previous base before the update), which is equal to (- sum_{k=0 to i-2} rem_k) mod m.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt step i (processing a[i]):\n\nbase_prev is the base before the update, which is base_{i-1} = (- sum_{k=0 to i-2} rem_k) mod m.\n\nThen, after processing a[i], the new base is base_i = (base_prev - rem_i) mod m = (- sum_{k=0 to i-1} rem_k) mod m.\n\nThe key for the merge is base_prev, which is the previous base.\n\nThe ans is adding the count of the current base (base_i) in the dp map.\n\nThe dp map counts the number of times each previous base (base_prev) has been seen.\n\nSo the ans is the sum over all i of the number of times the current base (base_i) has been a previous base in any of the previous steps.\n\nWait, because the current base_i is the new base after step i. The count of base_i in the dp map is the number of times base_i has been a previous base (i.e., base_j for some j < i).\n\nThus, the total ans is the number of pairs (j, i) where j < i and base_j == base_i.\n\nBecause for each i, the ans increases by the count of base_i in the dp map (which counts how many times base_i has been seen before).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs of indices (j, i) where j < i and base_j == base_i.\n\nThe base array is the sequence of base values after each step.\n\nThe initial base is 0 (before any steps). Then after first step, base_0 is the base after first element.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, base is 0 (before any steps).\n\nAfter processing the first element (i=0):\n\nbase_prev =0 (the initial base).\n\nThen, the new base is (0 - rem0) mod m.\n\nThe key is base_prev (0), so we increment dp[0] by 1.\n\nThen, ans += dp[base_i], where base_i is the new base (base_0).\n\nBut dp[base_i] is the count of how many times base_i has been seen before. Since this is the first time, it's 0.\n\nThen, for the second element (i=1):\n\nbase_prev is base_0.\n\nThe new base is base_0 - rem1 mod m.\n\nThe key is base_prev (base_0), so we increment dp[base_0] by 1.\n\nThen, ans += dp[base_i], which is the count of base_i (the new base) in the dp map. The count is the number of times base_i has been seen before. Since this is the first time (unless base_i equals previous bases).\n\nSo the total ans is the number of pairs (j < i) where base_j == base_i.\n\nThus, the problem is to count the number of such pairs.\n\nNow, the question is, can we compute this without a hash map?\n\nThe base sequence is:\n\nbase_0 = (0 - rem0) mod m.\n\nbase_1 = (base_0 - rem1) mod m.\n\nand so on.\n\nThe base sequence is a sequence of values mod m.\n\nThe count of pairs is the number of times a value appears more than once, and for each occurrence after the first, it contributes the number of previous occurrences.\n\nThis is the classic problem of counting the number of pairs with the same value in a sequence, which can be done with a frequency array or a hash map.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't use an array. So we need a hash map.\n\nIn C, implementing a hash map is possible using a linked list-based approach or using a library likeuthash, but since we can't use external libraries, we have to implement it ourselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a hash table with a dynamic array and separate chaining.\n\nBut this is quite involved for a programming competition problem. However, given the problem's constraints (n up to 1e5), a hash table with O(n) time should be manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a hash map in C to track the frequency of each base value.\n\nEach entry in the hash map will have a key (the base value) and a count.\n\nThe hash function can be the key itself modulo a prime number (like 1e6+3), and the table size can be a prime number.\n\nBut implementing this requires some code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a simple array of linked lists.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the hash map implementation:\n\nDefine a structure for the hash entries:\n\nstruct entry {\n    int key;\n    int count;\n    struct entry *next;\n};\n\nWe'll have an array of buckets. The number of buckets can be a prime number, say 100003.\n\nThe hash function is key % BUCKET_SIZE.\n\nFor each insertion or lookup:\n\n- Compute the hash.\n\n- Traverse the linked list in that bucket to find the key.\n\n- If found, increment count.\n\n- If not found, add a new entry.\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nInitialize the hash table with BUCKET_SIZE buckets, each initialized to NULL.\n\nInitialize base =0.\n\nans =0.\n\nAlso, we need to track the initial base (0) before any elements are processed.\n\nWait, the initial base is 0. Before processing any elements, the first step is to process the first element (i=0):\n\nThe first step:\n\nbase_prev =0 (initial base).\n\nThen, the key is base_prev (0), so we need to increment the count of 0 in the hash map.\n\nBut before processing any elements, the initial base is 0, so the first step's key is 0.\n\nWait, the initial base is 0, and before processing the first element, the base is 0.\n\nSo the first element's processing:\n\nbase_prev =0.\n\nThen, after processing, the new base is (0 - rem0) mod m.\n\nThe key is 0, so we increment the count of 0 in the hash map.\n\nThen, ans += the count of the new base (base_i) in the hash map. But the new base is (0 - rem0 mod m), which hasn't been seen before (unless rem0 is 0).\n\nSo the ans starts accumulating.\n\nThus, the initial base (0) must be counted in the hash map before processing any elements.\n\nWait, the first step's key is the previous base (0), so we need to have the initial base counted in the hash map before processing any elements.\n\nAh, right! Because the first element's key is the initial base (0), so we need to have the initial base counted in the hash map before processing any elements.\n\nSo before the loop over the elements, we need to add the initial base (0) to the hash map with count 1.\n\nWait, because the first element's key is the previous base (0), so the first increment is for the initial base.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe initial base is 0.\n\nBefore processing any elements, the hash map should have the count of 0 as 1 (because the initial base is 0).\n\nThen, when processing the first element:\n\nThe key is base_prev (0), so we increment the count of 0 to 2.\n\nThen, the ans += the count of the new base (base_i) in the hash map. The new base is (0 - rem0) mod m. The count of that base in the hash map is 0 (unless it was already there).\n\nWait, but the new base is the current base after processing the first element. The hash map hasn't been updated with that base yet. The hash map only tracks the previous bases.\n\nAh, right. The hash map tracks the previous bases (the base before each step). So the initial base (0) is counted before any steps.\n\nThen, after processing each element, the new base is the current base, and the next step's base_prev will be this new base.\n\nThus, the hash map must be updated with the previous base (base_prev) before processing the next element.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize the hash map with the initial base (0) having count 1.\n\nThen, for each element:\n\n    compute rem.\n\n    base_prev = current base.\n\n    compute new base.\n\n    key = base_prev.\n\n    increment the count of key in the hash map.\n\n    ans += the count of new base in the hash map.\n\n    set current base to new base.\n\nWait, but the count of new base in the hash map is the number of times it has been a previous base before this step.\n\nBecause the new base is the current base after this step, and the next step's base_prev will be this new base.\n\nThus, the ans is the sum of the counts of the new base in the hash map before this step.\n\nWait, no. The ans is added the count of the new base in the hash map at the time of processing.\n\nBecause the new base is the current base after this step. The count of the new base in the hash map is the number of times it has been a previous base in previous steps.\n\nYes, because the hash map contains all previous bases (before this step).\n\nThus, the algorithm can be implemented with a hash map that tracks the count of each previous base.\n\nThus, the steps in code are:\n\nInitialize the hash map with the initial base (0) count 1.\n\nans =0.\n\ncurrent_base =0.\n\nfor each a[i] in the array:\n\n    rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\n    base_prev = current_base;\n\n    new_base = (current_base - rem + m) % m;\n\n    // update hash map for base_prev:\n\n    // find base_prev in the hash map and increment count.\n\n    // then, ans += the count of new_base in the hash map.\n\n    // then set current_base to new_base.\n\n    // but the order is important.\n\n    // first, find base_prev in the hash map and increment its count.\n\n    // then, find new_base in the hash map and add its current count to ans.\n\n    // then, set current_base to new_base.\n\nWait, no. The order is:\n\n1. base_prev is current_base.\n\n2. compute new_base.\n\n3. increment the count of base_prev in the hash map.\n\n4. ans += the count of new_base in the hash map.\n\n5. set current_base to new_base.\n\nYes, because the new_base is the current_base after this step. The count of new_base in the hash map is the number of times it has been a previous base before this step.\n\nThus, the steps are correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in C with a hash map.\n\nThe hash map implementation:\n\nLet's choose BUCKET_SIZE as a prime number, say 1000003.\n\nWe'll have an array of pointers to linked lists.\n\nstruct entry {\n    int key;\n    int count;\n    struct entry *next;\n};\n\n#define BUCKET_SIZE 1000003\n\nstruct entry *buckets[BUCKET_SIZE];\n\nvoid init_hash() {\n    for (int i=0; i<BUCKET_SIZE; i++) buckets[i] = NULL;\n}\n\nvoid add_to_hash(int key) {\n    int hash = key % BUCKET_SIZE;\n    if (hash <0) hash += BUCKET_SIZE;\n    struct entry *e = buckets[hash];\n    while (e) {\n        if (e->key == key) {\n            e->count++;\n            return;\n        }\n        e = e->next;\n    }\n    // not found, add new entry\n    struct entry *new_e = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));\n    new_e->key = key;\n    new_e->count =1;\n    new_e->next = buckets[hash];\n    buckets[hash] = new_e;\n}\n\nint get_count(int key) {\n    int hash = key % BUCKET_SIZE;\n    if (hash <0) hash += BUCKET_SIZE;\n    struct entry *e = buckets[hash];\n    while (e) {\n        if (e->key == key) return e->count;\n        e = e->next;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut we need to initialize the hash with the initial base (0) having count 1.\n\nSo before the loop:\n\ninit_hash();\n\nadd_to_hash(0);\n\ncurrent_base =0;\n\nans =0;\n\nThen, for each a[i]:\n\n    rem = (a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\n    base_prev = current_base;\n\n    new_base = (current_base - rem + m) % m;\n\n    // increment the count of base_prev:\n\n    add_to_hash(base_prev);\n\n    // get the count of new_base:\n\n    ans += get_count(new_base);\n\n    current_base = new_base;\n\nWait, no. Because the add_to_hash(base_prev) increments the count of base_prev by 1. But the initial count for base_prev (0) was 1. After the first add_to_hash(0), it becomes 2.\n\nWait, but the initial call to add_to_hash(0) before the loop sets it to 1. Then, in the first iteration:\n\nbase_prev is 0.\n\nadd_to_hash(0) increments it to 2.\n\nThen, get_count(new_base) is the count of new_base before this step.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nBut in the first iteration:\n\nAfter the initial add_to_hash(0), the count is 1.\n\nThen, in the first iteration:\n\nbase_prev is 0.\n\nadd_to_hash(0) increases it to 2.\n\nThen, the count of new_base (which is (0 - rem0 +m) mod m) is whatever it was before this step. Since it hasn't been added yet, it's 0 unless it was a previous base.\n\nThus, the ans increases by 0.\n\nThen, current_base is set to new_base.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem is straightforward.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe C program steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n integers into an array a.\n\nInitialize the hash map.\n\nProcess the first part to compute ans.\n\nThen, use that ans as the position for the second part.\n\nCompute the second part's answer and print it.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define BUCKET_SIZE 1000003\n\nstruct entry {\n    int key;\n    int count;\n    struct entry *next;\n};\n\nstruct entry *buckets[BUCKET_SIZE];\n\nvoid init_hash() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < BUCKET_SIZE; i++) {\n        buckets[i] = NULL;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid add_to_hash(int key) {\n    int hash = key % BUCKET_SIZE;\n    if (hash < 0) hash += BUCKET_SIZE;\n    struct entry *e = buckets[hash];\n    while (e) {\n        if (e->key == key) {\n            e->count++;\n            return;\n        }\n        e = e->next;\n    }\n    // Not found, create new entry\n    struct entry *new_e = (struct entry*)malloc(sizeof(struct entry));\n    new_e->key = key;\n    new_e->count = 1;\n    new_e->next = buckets[hash];\n    buckets[hash] = new_e;\n}\n\nint get_count(int key) {\n    int hash = key % BUCKET_SIZE;\n    if (hash < 0) hash += BUCKET_SIZE;\n    struct entry *e = buckets[hash];\n    while (e) {\n        if (e->key == key) return e->count;\n        e = e->next;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    // First part\n    init_hash();\n    add_to_hash(0); // initial base is 0, count 1\n    int current_base = 0;\n    long long ans_part1 = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int rem = a[i] % m;\n        if (rem < 0) rem += m;\n        int base_prev = current_base;\n        int new_base = (current_base - rem + m) % m;\n        add_to_hash(base_prev); // increment count of base_prev\n        ans_part1 += get_count(new_base);\n        current_base = new_base;\n    }\n\n    // Second part\n    long long position = ans_part1;\n    long long nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n    while (1) {\n        long long next_val = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx * 2 - 1) * (nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) / 2;\n        if (next_val >= position) break;\n        nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n    }\n    while (1) {\n        long long next_val = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx + 1 - 1) * (nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) / 2;\n        if (next_val > position) break;\n        nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n    }\n    long long start = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx - 1) * nrst"
