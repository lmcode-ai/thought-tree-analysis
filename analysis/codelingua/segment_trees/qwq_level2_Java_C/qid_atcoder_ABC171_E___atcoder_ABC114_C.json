So in C code, variables for i and next_i should be long long. So putting this together, the function to compute the next i would be something like:\n\nlong long next_i(long long current_i) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", current_i);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    char new_str[20];\n\n    int new_len = 0;\n\n    int f = 0;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\n        char c = s[len - 1 - j]; // the j-th character from the end. if (!f) {\n\n            if (c == '3') {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n\n                f = 1;\n\n            } else if (c == '5') {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n\n                f = 1;\n\n            } else {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_str[new_len++] = c;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n    }\n\n    // Now reverse new_str to get the next number. char reversed[20];\n\n    for (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n\n        reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n\n    }\n\n    reversed[new_len] = '\\0';\n\n    return atoll(reversed);\n\n} Wait, but in C, the function atoll converts a string to long long. So that's correct. Now, the loop in the second part of the code would be:\n\nlong long i = 357;\n\nint c = 0;\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n    // check if the current i contains 3,5,7.\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n    int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n\n    for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) { if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n\n        else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n\n        else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n    // compute next i.\n\n    i = next_i(i);\n\n}\n\nSo putting all together, the C program would:\n\nRead n, read the array a.\n\nCompute r as XOR of all elements. Compute the array b where each element is r ^ a[i]. Take N = b[0]. Then compute c via the loop above. Finally, print c.\n\nNow, let's structure the C code step by step. First, read n and the array a.\n\nIn C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    int r = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n        r ^= a[i];\n    }\n    // compute b array\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        b[i] = r ^ a[i];\n    }\n    // Now, N is the first element of b.\n    long long N = b[0];\n    // Now process the second part. // Implement the second part's logic here. // ... code for second part ...\n    // Finally, print c.\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n} Now, the second part's code:\n\nImplement the loop with i starting at 357, and compute c.\n\nFirst, the function next_i as above. But in C, functions can't be inside main, so need to write it as a helper function. Wait, but in C, functions must be declared before use. So perhaps better to inline the code. Alternatively, write the next_i function. Let me write the helper function next_i. But first, let's see:\n\nThe code for the second part:\n\nlong long i = 357;\nint c = 0; while (i <= N) {\n    // check if contains 3,5,7\n    char s[20];\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n    int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) {\n        if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n        else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n        else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n    }\n    if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n    // compute next i\n    // compute next_i here.\n    // code for next_i\n    // ... same as before ...\n    // then assign to i.\n}\n\nAlternatively, to avoid writing a function, we can inline the code for next_i. So inside the loop:\n\nlong long next_i_val;\n\n// compute next_i_val from current i.\n\nchar s[20];\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\nint len = strlen(s);\nchar new_str[20];\nint new_len = 0;\nint f = 0;\nfor (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n    char c = s[len - 1 - j]; if (!f) {\n        if (c == '3') {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n            f = 1;\n        } else if (c == '5') {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n            f = 1;\n        } else {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n        }\n    } else {\n        new_str[new_len++] = c;\n    }\n} if (!f) {\n    new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n}\nchar reversed[20];\nfor (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n    reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n}\nreversed[new_len] = '\\0';\nnext_i_val = atoll(reversed);\n\ni = next_i_val;\n\nThis is a bit lengthy, but manageable. Putting it all together:\n\nThe full C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    int r = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n        r ^= a[i];\n    }\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        b[i] = r ^ a[i];\n    }\n    long long N = b[0];\n    long long i = 357;\n    int c = 0; while (i <= N) {\n        // Check if contains 3,5,7\n        char s[20];\n        sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n        int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) {\n            if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n            else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n            else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n        }\n        if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n        // Compute next i\n        char s_i[20];\n        sprintf(s_i, \"%lld\", i);\n        int len = strlen(s_i);\n        char new_str[20];\n        int new_len = 0;\n        int f = 0;\n        for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n            char c_char = s_i[len - 1 - j];\n            if (!f) {\n                if (c_char == '3') {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else if (c_char == '5') {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n                }\n            } else {\n                new_str[new_len++] = c_char;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!f) {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n        }\n        char reversed[20];\n        for (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n            reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n        }\n        reversed[new_len] = '\\0';\n        i = atoll(reversed);\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in the code above, the next_i computation is done inline each time. That's okay, but it's a bit long. Let me check for possible errors. First, the array a is declared as int a[n], which is okay in C99, but some compilers might require -std=c99 or similar.",

Another possible issue: when converting to string, leading zeros? Probably not, since numbers don't have leading zeros when printed. Testing with the example where first program's output is \"1 2 1\", so N is 1. Then the loop starts with i=357, which is larger than 1, so the loop doesn't run, c remains 0. The output is 0. That's correct. Another test case: Let's say the first program's output is 357 (so N=357). Then the loop starts with i=357.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC171_E). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It calculates the XOR of all elements into r. Then, for each element a[i], it prints r ^ a[i], separated by spaces. So the output of this first program is a list of numbers, each being the XOR of r and the original a[i]. The next program (atcoder_ABC114_C) takes this output as input and processes it.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C) seems a bit more complex. Let me parse it step by step. It reads N, then starts with i=357. It counts how many numbers up to N are \"mysterious\" (contain 3,5,7). But wait, the code's loop is a bit different. Wait, the loop is while i <= N. The initial i is 357. Then, in each iteration, it checks if the current i's string contains all three digits 3,5,7. If so, increments c. Then constructs a new number by some transformation. The transformation part is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe code converts i to a string, then processes it in reverse. The loop over j from 0 to s.length()-1. The first character (from the end) is processed. The code builds a new string. The variable f is a flag. If f is false, then for each character, if it's 3, replace with 5 and set f to true. If it's 5, replace with 7 and set f. Else, just put 3. If after processing all characters, f is still false, append a 3. Then reverse the string to get the next i. \n\nHmm, this seems like generating the next number in some sequence. The loop continues until i exceeds N. The count c is the number of numbers in this sequence that contain all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the input for the second. So the second program's input is the list of numbers from the first program's output. But in the second Java program, the input is read via the scanner, but in the code provided, the second program's main starts by reading N via gi(), which is scanner.next(). So the second program expects the first's output as its input. But in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's N is the first's output? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is a list of numbers, each being r^a[i]. The second program's input is that list. But the second program's first line is reading N as gi(), which would be the first number in the input. Wait, but the first program's output is multiple numbers separated by spaces. So the second program's N is the first number of that output? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's input is the list of numbers from the first's output. But the second program's code starts by reading N as gi(), which would be the first number in the input. So the second program is expecting that the first number in its input is N, but the first program's output is a list of numbers. Wait, that might not align. Wait, perhaps the second program is expecting N to be the first number, but the first program's output is a list of numbers. So maybe the first program's output is a list of numbers, and the second program is supposed to process all of them. But in the second Java code, the loop is while i <= N, where N is the first input. So perhaps the first program's output is a single number? Wait, no. Looking back at the first Java program: the first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. For example, if n=3 and the a array is [1,2,3], then r would be 1^2^3 = 0, so the output would be 0^1=1, 0^2=2, 0^3=1, so \"1 2 1\". So the second program would read that as input. But the second program's first step is to read N via gi(), which would take the first number (1 in this example) as N. Then the loop starts with i=357, but 357 is larger than N=1, so the loop doesn't run, and c remains 0. Then the output is 0. But that's probably not the intended behavior. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's input is the entire output of the first program. So the second program's first input is the list of numbers from the first's output. But in the second Java code, the first thing it does is read N via gi(), which would be the first number in the input. So the second program is expecting that the first number in its input is N, but the first program's output is a list of numbers. So perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output, but the code is written in a way that it's expecting N as the first input, then the rest? That might not align. Wait, perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output, but the code is written to read N as the first input, then process numbers up to N. But that would require that the first program's output is a list of numbers, and the second program's N is the first number in that list, then the rest are not used. That might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output, but the code is written in a way that it's expecting N as the first input, then the rest of the numbers are not used. That would be a problem. Wait, maybe I need to look at the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code's main function:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int N = gi(); // reads first integer from input\n    long i = 357;\n    int c = 0;\n    while (i <= N) {\n        String s = String.valueOf(i);\n        if (s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\")) c++;\n        // ... then generate next i via some transformation\n    }\n    System.out.println(c);\n}\n\nSo the second program is counting how many numbers in the sequence starting at 357, generated by some transformation, up to N, contain all three digits 3,5,7. The N here is the first input number from the first program's output. The rest of the numbers from the first program's output are not used. But that would mean that the second program is only using the first number of the first's output. But the first program's output is a list of numbers. So perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output, but the code is written in a way that it's only using the first one. That suggests that maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to process each number from the first's output as N, and sum the counts? Or maybe the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output as N, but that's unclear. Wait, perhaps the second program is supposed to take all the numbers from the first's output as a list, and process each of them as N, but the code is written to read only the first N. That would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output as individual N's and sum the counts. But the code as written would only process the first N. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's input is the entire output of the first. So the second program must read all the numbers from the first's output. But in the second Java code, the first thing it does is read N via gi(), which is the first number. The rest of the numbers are not read. So that suggests that the second program is only using the first number of the first's output as N, and the rest are ignored. But that would mean that the second program's input is only the first number of the first's output. But the first program's output is a list of numbers. So perhaps the second program is supposed to process each of those numbers as N, and sum the counts? Or maybe the second program is supposed to process all the numbers as a single N? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output as a list, but the code is written in a way that it's only using the first one. That would be a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the first program's output.\n\nWait, looking back at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. For example, if n=3 and the a array is [1,2,3], then the output is \"1 2 1\". So the second program's input is \"1 2 1\". The second program's first step is to read N via gi(), which would read the first number (1). Then the loop runs while i (starting at 357) is <= N (1). Since 357>1, the loop doesn't run, so c remains 0. The output is 0. But that's probably not the intended behavior. So perhaps the second program is supposed to process all the numbers from the first's output as N? Or maybe the second program is supposed to process each number in the first's output as N and sum the counts? But the code as written would only process the first N. That suggests that there's a problem here. Alternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to read all the numbers from the first's output and process them in some way. But the code is written to read N as the first input, then process numbers up to N. So perhaps the second program is supposed to take the first number from the first's output as N, and then process that. But that would mean that the rest of the numbers are ignored. That might be the case, but then the problem is that the first program's output is a list of numbers, but the second program only uses the first one. So the user's setup might have a mistake, but I have to follow the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to read all the numbers from the first's output and process each as N, but the code is written to read only the first. That would be a problem. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the problem again. The user says that the two Java programs are to be translated into a single C program that does the same. So the C program must first do what the first Java program does, then pass the result to the second's processing, but without I/O in between. So the first part's output is the input to the second part's processing, but in the C program, they are in the same process, so we can pass data via variables.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nIn C:\n\n- Read input (from stdin) as the first Java program does.\n\n- Process the first part (compute r and the array of r^a[i], then collect those values into an array or list).\n\n- Then, process the second part using that array as the input data.\n\n- The second part's processing must be done without I/O, so instead of reading from stdin, it uses the data from the first part.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's main logic is based on N being the first number of the input. So in the C program, the first part's output is the list of numbers (the r^a[i] values). The second part's N is the first number of that list. Then the second part's processing is done with that N. The rest of the numbers from the first part are not used. So the second part's processing is based on the first number of the first's output. That's how the original Java setup works. So the C program must do the same.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array a from stdin (first part's input).\n\n2. Compute r as the XOR of all elements in a.\n\n3. Compute the array b where each element is r ^ a[i].\n\n4. The first element of b is the N for the second part.\n\n5. The second part's processing is done with N = b[0], and the rest of the numbers are not used (since the second Java program only reads the first number as N).\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code uses the initial i=357 and loops while i <= N. So the second part's processing is based on N being the first element of the first's output. The rest of the numbers from the first's output are not used. So the second part's processing is only dependent on the first element of the first's output. Therefore, in the C program, after computing the array b (the first part's output), the second part's N is b[0], and the rest of the elements are not needed. So the second part can proceed with N = b[0].\n\nTherefore, the C program will:\n\n- Read n and the array a.\n\n- Compute r and the array b (each element is r ^ a[i]).\n\n- Then, take the first element of b as N for the second part.\n\n- Then, process the second part's logic with N = b[0].\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code has a loop that starts with i=357 and increments via some transformation. The count c is the number of numbers in the sequence generated by that loop (starting at 357, then transformed each time) that are <= N and contain 3,5,7.\n\nSo in the C program, the second part's processing is to compute c based on N = b[0].\n\nTherefore, the C program can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read n and a array.\n\n- Compute r and b array.\n\n- Set N = b[0].\n\n- Then compute c by simulating the second Java program's loop with this N.\n\n- Finally, output c.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code also has some transformation steps to generate the next i. Let me re-examine that part.\n\nThe second Java program's loop:\n\nlong i = 357;\n\nint c = 0;\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n    // check if current i has 3,5,7\n\n    // then generate next i via some transformation\n\n}\n\nThe transformation part is:\n\nThe code converts i to a string s. Then builds a new string via a process:\n\nThe code loops over the characters in reverse (since j starts from 0 to s.length-1, and the character is s.charAt(s.length-1 -j)), so processing from the last character to the first.\n\nThe code uses a flag f. Initially false.\n\nFor each character (starting from the last digit):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- if the current character is '3', replace it with '5', set f to true.\n\n- if it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n- else, replace with '3'.\n\nElse (f is true):\n\n- just append the current character.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false, append a '3'.\n\nThen reverse the string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuilder. Let me see:\n\nThe code builds the string as follows:\n\nThe loop is for each j from 0 to s.length-1:\n\nThe current character is s's character at position (s.length-1 -j). So for j=0, it's the last character of s. For j=1, the second last, etc.\n\nThe first character processed is the last digit of the number.\n\nThe code builds the new string as follows:\n\nInitially, the sb is empty.\n\nFor each character in reverse order (from last digit to first):\n\nIf f is false (meaning we haven't made a change yet):\n\n- if the current character is '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n- else if '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n- else, replace with '3'.\n\n- append the new character to sb.\n\nElse (f is true):\n\n- append the current character as is.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5?), then append a '3'.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed (since the processing was in reverse order?), wait no. Wait, the code then does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is built by processing the digits in reverse order (from the end of the original string). The code then reverses the sb again? Let me see:\n\nWait, the code builds the new string in the following way:\n\nSuppose the original number is 357 (string \"357\").\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (digits '7', '5', '3').\n\nStarting with j=0 (the last character '7'):\n\nf is false.\n\nThe current character is '7', which is not 3 or 5. So replace with '3', append to sb. Now sb is \"3\".\n\nf is still false (since the replacement was to '3', but the condition was to set f only if the original was 3 or 5? Wait, no. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') {\n\n    sb.append('5');\n\n    f = true;\n\n} else if (a == '5') {\n\n    sb.append('7');\n\n    f = true;\n\n} else {\n\n    sb.append('3');\n\n}\n\nSo for a character that is not 3 or 5 (like '7'), it appends '3', but does not set f to true. So in this case, after processing '7', the f remains false.\n\nThen next character (j=1, the '5'):\n\ncurrent a is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nNow, the sb is \"37\".\n\nThen next character (j=2, the '3'):\n\nsince f is now true, append the original '3' (since f is true, so we just append the current a (which is '3').\n\nSo the sb after all characters is \"373\".\n\nThen, after processing all characters, since f was set to true (because of the '5'), we don't append anything else.\n\nThen, the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); // sb is \"373\"\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the reverse of \"373\" is \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the original i was 357. The next i is 373. Then the loop continues as long as i <= N.\n\nHmm, this transformation is a bit complex. The code is generating the next i by modifying the digits in a certain way. The process is:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, look for the first occurrence of 3 or 5. Replace it with the next in the sequence (3\u21925, 5\u21927). If none found, append a 3 at the end. Then, the new number is formed by reversing the modified digits (since the processing was done in reverse order, but then reversed again? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the code builds the new string by processing the digits from the end to the beginning. For each digit, if it's 3 or 5, replace it and set the flag. Once the flag is set, the rest are copied as is. Then, if the flag was never set (meaning no 3 or 5 found), append a 3. Then, the new string is reversed again? Because the code does sb2.reverse(). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe original digits are processed in reverse order (from last to first). The new string is built in the order of processing (so the first character in the new string is the modified last digit of the original). Then, when reversed, the new string becomes the original order but with the modifications. \n\nWait, let's take the example of 357:\n\nOriginal string is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character in reverse (7,5,3):\n\n- first character (7) is not 3 or 5 \u2192 replaced with 3 \u2192 sb now has \"3\".\n\n- second character (5) \u2192 replaced with 7 \u2192 sb becomes \"37\", and f is set to true.\n\n- third character (3) \u2192 since f is true, append as is \u2192 sb becomes \"373\".\n\nThen, the code creates a StringBuffer of sb (which is \"373\"), reverses it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\", so the new i is 373.\n\nWait, but the next i would be 373. Then, the next iteration would process 373.\n\nLet me see another example. Suppose i is 373:\n\nString is \"373\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (digits 3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false. Since it's 3 \u2192 replace with 5, set f to true. So append '5' \u2192 sb starts with '5'.\n\nSecond character (7): since f is true, append as is \u2192 '57'.\n\nThird character (3): append as is \u2192 '573'.\n\nThen, since f was set, no need to append 3. Then reverse the sb (which is \"573\") \u2192 reversed is \"375\". Wait, no. Wait, the code does:\n\nsb2 = new StringBuffer(sb) \u2192 \"573\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"375\".\n\nSo the next i is 375.\n\nSo the next i is 375. Then check if it's <= N. \n\nSo the transformation is modifying the digits from the right, replacing the first 3 or 5 with the next in the sequence, then appending 3 if none found, and then reversing the string to get the next number.\n\nThis is a bit tricky to implement in C. Let me think about how to code this.\n\nThe steps for generating the next i are:\n\n1. Convert current i to a string.\n\n2. Process each character from the end to the beginning (i.e., from the last digit to the first).\n\n3. For each character, if we haven't made a change yet (f is false):\n\n   a. if it's '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n   b. else if '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n   c. else, replace with '3'.\n\n   d. append the new character to the new string.\n\n4. If we have made a change (f is true), append the remaining characters as is.\n\n5. If no change was made (f remains false), append '3' to the new string.\n\n6. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the code in Java does the following:\n\nThe new string is built in the order of processing (from last digit to first), so the first character in the new string is the modified last digit. Then, when reversed, it becomes the correct order. \n\nWait, let me think of the example again with 357:\n\nOriginal digits: 3 5 7 \u2192 string \"357\".\n\nProcessing in reverse (7,5,3):\n\nAfter processing, the new string is \"373\" (from the steps above). Then, when reversed, it becomes \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the new string after processing is \"373\", then reversed gives the same. So the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: i=373 \u2192 string \"373\".\n\nProcessing in reverse (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3) \u2192 replaced with 5 \u2192 new string starts with '5'.\n\nSecond character (7) \u2192 append as is (since f is now true) \u2192 '57'.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 append as is \u2192 '573'.\n\nThen, since f was set, no need to add 3. The new string is \"573\". Reversed gives \"375\".\n\nSo next i is 375.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits from the end, modifying the first 3 or 5 found, then appending the rest. The new string is then reversed to form the next number.\n\nTherefore, in C, to implement this, I need to:\n\n- Convert the current i to a string.\n\n- Process each character from the end to the beginning (i.e., from the last character to the first).\n\n- Build a new string as per the rules.\n\n- If no change was made, append '3' to the new string.\n\n- Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nBut in C, handling strings can be a bit tricky. Let's think of steps:\n\nFirst, to process the digits of i:\n\nWe can convert the number to a string, then process each character.\n\nAlternatively, process the digits without converting to a string, but that might be more complex.\n\nProbably easier to convert to a string.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nFor a given i:\n\n1. Convert to a string s.\n\n2. Reverse the string (so that we can process from the first character as the last digit).\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe original string is s = \"357\".\n\nWe need to process the characters in reverse order (7,5,3). So the reversed string would be \"753\", then process each character in order (so first character is 7, then 5, then 3).\n\nAlternatively, process the original string from the end.\n\nIn code:\n\nchar s[20]; // assuming i can be up to 1e18, but in C, maybe use a buffer.\n\nsprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n\nint len = strlen(s);\n\nchar new_str[20];\n\nint new_len = 0;\n\nint f = 0;\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\n    char c = s[len - 1 - j]; // the j-th character from the end.\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        if (c == '3') {\n\n            new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n\n            f = 1;\n\n        } else if (c == '5') {\n\n            new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n\n            f = 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        new_str[new_len++] = c;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (!f) {\n\n    new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n}\n\n// Now, the new_str is built in the order of processing (from last digit to first, modified).\n\n// To get the next i, we need to reverse this new_str and parse as a number.\n\n// So reverse the new_str.\n\nchar reversed[20];\n\nint k;\n\nfor (k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n\n    reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n\n}\n\nreversed[k] = '\\0';\n\nlong next_i = atol(reversed);\n\nWait, but in C, atol is for long? Or maybe use strtoul. Alternatively, use strtol.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, i is a long, so in C, we can use long long to handle large numbers.\n\nWait, the second Java program uses long for i, so in C, we need to use long long to store i.\n\nSo in C code, variables for i and next_i should be long long.\n\nSo putting this together, the function to compute the next i would be something like:\n\nlong long next_i(long long current_i) {\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", current_i);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    char new_str[20];\n\n    int new_len = 0;\n\n    int f = 0;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\n        char c = s[len - 1 - j]; // the j-th character from the end.\n\n        if (!f) {\n\n            if (c == '3') {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n\n                f = 1;\n\n            } else if (c == '5') {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n\n                f = 1;\n\n            } else {\n\n                new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_str[new_len++] = c;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n\n    }\n\n    // Now reverse new_str to get the next number.\n\n    char reversed[20];\n\n    for (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n\n        reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n\n    }\n\n    reversed[new_len] = '\\0';\n\n    return atoll(reversed);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the function atoll converts a string to long long. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the loop in the second part of the code would be:\n\nlong long i = 357;\n\nint c = 0;\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n    // check if the current i contains 3,5,7.\n\n    char s[20];\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n\n    int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n\n    for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) {\n\n        if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n\n        else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n\n        else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n    // compute next i.\n\n    i = next_i(i);\n\n}\n\nSo putting all together, the C program would:\n\nRead n, read the array a.\n\nCompute r as XOR of all elements.\n\nCompute the array b where each element is r ^ a[i].\n\nTake N = b[0].\n\nThen compute c via the loop above.\n\nFinally, print c.\n\nNow, let's structure the C code step by step.\n\nFirst, read n and the array a.\n\nIn C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    int r = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n        r ^= a[i];\n    }\n    // compute b array\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        b[i] = r ^ a[i];\n    }\n    // Now, N is the first element of b.\n    long long N = b[0];\n    // Now process the second part.\n    // Implement the second part's logic here.\n    // ... code for second part ...\n    // Finally, print c.\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nImplement the loop with i starting at 357, and compute c.\n\nFirst, the function next_i as above. But in C, functions can't be inside main, so need to write it as a helper function.\n\nWait, but in C, functions must be declared before use. So perhaps better to inline the code.\n\nAlternatively, write the next_i function.\n\nLet me write the helper function next_i.\n\nBut first, let's see:\n\nThe code for the second part:\n\nlong long i = 357;\nint c = 0;\nwhile (i <= N) {\n    // check if contains 3,5,7\n    char s[20];\n    sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n    int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) {\n        if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n        else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n        else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n    }\n    if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n    // compute next i\n    // compute next_i here.\n    // code for next_i\n    // ... same as before ...\n    // then assign to i.\n}\n\nAlternatively, to avoid writing a function, we can inline the code for next_i.\n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nlong long next_i_val;\n\n// compute next_i_val from current i.\n\nchar s[20];\nsprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\nint len = strlen(s);\nchar new_str[20];\nint new_len = 0;\nint f = 0;\nfor (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n    char c = s[len - 1 - j];\n    if (!f) {\n        if (c == '3') {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n            f = 1;\n        } else if (c == '5') {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n            f = 1;\n        } else {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n        }\n    } else {\n        new_str[new_len++] = c;\n    }\n}\nif (!f) {\n    new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n}\nchar reversed[20];\nfor (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n    reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n}\nreversed[new_len] = '\\0';\nnext_i_val = atoll(reversed);\n\ni = next_i_val;\n\nThis is a bit lengthy, but manageable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe full C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    int r = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n        r ^= a[i];\n    }\n    int b[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        b[i] = r ^ a[i];\n    }\n    long long N = b[0];\n    long long i = 357;\n    int c = 0;\n    while (i <= N) {\n        // Check if contains 3,5,7\n        char s[20];\n        sprintf(s, \"%lld\", i);\n        int has3 = 0, has5 = 0, has7 = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; s[k]; k++) {\n            if (s[k] == '3') has3 = 1;\n            else if (s[k] == '5') has5 = 1;\n            else if (s[k] == '7') has7 = 1;\n        }\n        if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n        // Compute next i\n        char s_i[20];\n        sprintf(s_i, \"%lld\", i);\n        int len = strlen(s_i);\n        char new_str[20];\n        int new_len = 0;\n        int f = 0;\n        for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n            char c_char = s_i[len - 1 - j];\n            if (!f) {\n                if (c_char == '3') {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '5';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else if (c_char == '5') {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '7';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else {\n                    new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n                }\n            } else {\n                new_str[new_len++] = c_char;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!f) {\n            new_str[new_len++] = '3';\n        }\n        char reversed[20];\n        for (int k = 0; k < new_len; k++) {\n            reversed[k] = new_str[new_len - 1 - k];\n        }\n        reversed[new_len] = '\\0';\n        i = atoll(reversed);\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the next_i computation is done inline each time. That's okay, but it's a bit long. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nFirst, the array a is declared as int a[n], which is okay in C99, but some compilers might require -std=c99 or similar. Alternatively, use a fixed size, but since n can be up to whatever the first program's input allows, but in practice, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother thing: the sprintf for the string s_i must be able to hold the number. Since in Java, the second program uses long, which is 64 bits. The maximum possible N is the first element of b, which is r ^ a[0]. Since a[i] can be up to whatever, but in the first program, the input is read as integers (int in Java, which is 32 bits). So the maximum possible N is up to 2^31-1, so the string can be stored in 20 characters (since 2^31 is about 2e9, which is 10 digits). So 20 is sufficient.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting to string, leading zeros? Probably not, since numbers don't have leading zeros when printed.\n\nTesting with the example where first program's output is \"1 2 1\", so N is 1. Then the loop starts with i=357, which is larger than 1, so the loop doesn't run, c remains 0. The output is 0. That's correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say the first program's output is 357 (so N=357). Then the loop starts with i=357. Check if it contains 3,5,7: yes. So c increments by 1. Then compute next i.\n\nProcessing 357:\n\nThe string is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (7,5,3):\n\nFirst character (7) is not 3 or 5 \u2192 replaced with 3 \u2192 new_str starts with '3'.\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 replaced with 7 \u2192 new_str is \"37\", f is set.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 append as is \u2192 new_str is \"373\".\n\nThen, since f is set, no need to add 3. Reversed gives \"373\".\n\nSo next i is 373.\n\nNow, 373 <= 357? No, so the loop stops. So c is 1. So the output would be 1.\n\nWait, but 373 is larger than 357, so the loop condition i <= N (357) is false. So the loop runs only once (i=357), so c is 1. So the output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say N is 375.\n\nThen the loop runs for i=357 (counted), then next i is 373 (<=375? 373 is less than 375 \u2192 yes. Check if 373 has all three digits: 3,7,3 \u2192 no 5. So not counted. Then next i is 375.\n\nCheck 375: contains 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 2.\n\nThen next i is computed as follows:\n\ni=375 \u2192 string \"375\".\n\nProcessing from the end (5,7,3):\n\nFirst character (5) \u2192 replaced with 7 \u2192 new_str starts with '7', f set.\n\nSecond character (7) \u2192 append as is \u2192 '77'.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 append as is \u2192 '773'.\n\nReversed gives 377 \u2192 next i is 377.\n\n377 is less than 375? No. So loop stops. So total c is 2.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the C code, the code for the second part should correctly compute this.\n\nAnother possible issue: the reversed array in the next_i computation must be null-terminated. In the code above, after the for loop, reversed[new_len] = '\\0'; is set. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible error: in the next_i code, the new_str is built with new_len elements, then reversed is filled with new_len characters, then the null terminator is added at reversed[new_len], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the final C program is as written above."
