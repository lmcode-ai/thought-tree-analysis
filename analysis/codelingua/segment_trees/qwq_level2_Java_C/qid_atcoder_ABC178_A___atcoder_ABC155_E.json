Then, since digits[1] is 0, which is less than 5, no carry. Then, i=1: digits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. Total bills is 5.",

First, the first_result is an integer (0 or 1). We can convert it to a string using sprintf. char input_str[2]; \n\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", first_result); \n\nThen, the length is strlen(input_str).

Wait, the second program's input is a string (number = sc.next()), so the input to the second program is the output of the first program, which is either \"0\" or \"1\". So the second program will process that input. Let's see what happens when the input is \"0\" or \"1\". Let me test with input 1 (so first program outputs 0). Then the second program's input is \"0\".

So add 0 to bills (so bills remains 0). Then, next i=1: digits[1] is 0. Check if it's 10? No. Then, since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. Total bills is 0. Wait, but the code's output would be 0? Wait, but let's see the code again. Wait, the code's loop runs for i from 0 to number.length(). Since the input is \"0\", number.length() is 1, so i goes up to 1. Wait, let's walk through the code step by step for input \"0\". First, digits array is size 2 (since length is 1, so 1+1=2). digits[0] is the first character of reversed \"0\", which is '0', so 0. digits[1] is 0 (initialized). Then, the loop starts with i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0, not 10. Then, since it's less than 5, add 0 to bills (so bills is 0). Next, i=1: digits[1] is 0. Check if it's 10?

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again. The first program's code:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 :0. bool is true when x is 1. So when x is 1 \u2192 ! bool is false \u2192 result is 0. Else \u2192 result is 1. So the first program's output is 1 - (x ==1). So the final output is the same as the first's.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC178_A. It reads an integer x from input. Then it sets a boolean to true if x is 1, else false. The result is 0 if the boolean is true, else 1. Then it prints the result. So basically, the result is 1 - x. Because if x is 1, result is 0; else, it's 1. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe code says: result = !bool ? 1 : 0. Wait, bool is true when x is 1. So !bool would be false when x is 1. So then the result is 1 when !bool is false? Wait, no. Let me parse that again. The ternary operator is: condition ? value1 : value2. So if the condition is true, it takes value1. So here, the condition is !bool. So if !bool is true (i.e., bool is false, so x is not 1), then result is 1. Else (when x is 1), it's 0. So yes, the result is 1 when x is 0, but wait, x is an integer parsed from input. Wait, but the input is given as a string via next(), so x is whatever the user inputs. So the first program's output is 1 if x is not 1, else 0. So the first program's output is (x != 1) ? 1 : 0. So the first program's output is 1 - (x == 1). So for example, if input is 1, output is 0; else, 1.\n\nNow the second Java program, atcoder_ABC155_E. It reads a string (number), which is a number, and processes its digits. Let me see what it does. The first step is to reverse the digits and store them in an array of size length+1. Wait, the digits array is initialized with length+1 elements. Then, for each i from 0 to number.length()-1, it takes the character from the end of the string (so the first digit is the last character of the input string, etc.), subtracts '0' to get the digit. The digits array is of size length+1, so the last element (digits[number.length()]) is initialized to 0? Wait, no, the loop runs from 0 to number.length()-1, so the digits array's first number.length() elements are filled, and the last element (digits[number.length()]) is not initialized here. Wait, the loop is for (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++), so the digits[i] are filled for i from 0 to number.length()-1. The digits array has an extra element at the end (digits[number.length()]) which is not initialized here. Hmm, but in Java, arrays are initialized to 0 for int, so that last element is 0 initially. Wait, but in the code, the digits array is declared as new int[number.length() + 1], so all elements are 0. Then, the loop fills the first number.length() elements with the reversed digits. So the digits array is the reversed digits of the input number, with an extra 0 at the end. \n\nThen, the code processes the digits to compute the number of bills. The variable bills starts at 0. The loop runs from i=0 to i <= number.length(). Wait, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++). So the loop includes the last element (digits[number.length()]). \n\nLooking at the code inside the loop:\n\nFirst, if digits[i] == 10, then it increments digits[i+1], sets digits[i] to 0. Wait, but digits[i] is an int, and initially, digits are 0-9 (since they are digits of the number). Wait, but how can digits[i] be 10? Because in the code, after processing, maybe during the loop, digits[i] can become 10? Let me see. The code first checks if digits[i] is 10. So perhaps during the processing, when adding to digits[i+1], it can carry over. Let me think through the algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm seems to be calculating the minimal number of coins or bills needed, perhaps in a system where each digit can be handled in a certain way. Let me see:\n\nThe code is processing each digit (starting from the least significant digit?), and for each digit, it's handling how many bills are needed. The logic is:\n\nIf the current digit is 10, then carry over to the next digit. So that's a carry operation. So first, whenever a digit is 10, it's set to 0, and the next digit is increased by 1. \n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, the bills are added. \n\nThe conditions are:\n\n- if digit <5: add the digit to bills. \n\n- if digit is 5: add 5, and if the next digit is >=5, carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\n- else (digit >5): carry over 1 to next digit, and add (10 - digit) to bills. \n\nWait, let me parse the code again:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10) {\n    digits[i + 1]++;\n    digits[i] = 0;\n}\n\nWait, but this is before the other conditions. So first, if the current digit is 10, it's handled by carrying over. But how does digits[i] become 10? Because in the first step, the digits are initialized from the input's digits (so 0-9). But during processing, when we add to digits[i+1], maybe in previous steps, digits[i] could have been set to 10? Hmm, perhaps the code is designed to handle digits that might have been incremented beyond 10. Wait, but the first check is for digits[i] ==10. So perhaps after the carry, the digit is set to 0, and the next digit is increased. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing each digit, and during the processing, the digit can be 10 (from a previous carry). So the first step is to handle any such case. \n\nThen, after that, the code checks the digit's value. \n\nSo the algorithm is processing each digit from the least significant to the most, perhaps, and calculating the minimal bills. \n\nThe key is that the first program's output is the input to the second program. \n\nSo the first program takes an integer x, outputs 0 or 1. Then the second program takes that output (which is a single digit, either \"0\" or \"1\") as its input. \n\nWait, the second program's input is a string (number = sc.next()), so the input to the second program is the output of the first program, which is either \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nSo the second program will process that input. Let's see what happens when the input is \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nLet me test with input 1 (so first program outputs 0). Then the second program's input is \"0\". \n\nProcessing \"0\":\n\ndigits array is of length 1 +1 = 2. \n\ndigits[0] = 0 (since the input is \"0\", reversed is \"0\", so first character is 0. \n\ndigits[1] is 0 (initialized). \n\nThen the loop runs from i=0 to 1 (since number.length() is 1, so i goes up to 1).\n\nFirst iteration i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0, so not 10. \n\nThen check if digits[0] <5: yes. So add 0 to bills (so bills remains 0). \n\nThen, next i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. \n\nCheck if it's 10? No. \n\nThen, since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. \n\nTotal bills is 0. \n\nWait, but the code's output would be 0? \n\nWait, but let's see the code again. Wait, the code's loop runs for i from 0 to number.length(). Since the input is \"0\", number.length() is 1, so i goes up to 1. \n\nWait, let's walk through the code step by step for input \"0\".\n\nFirst, digits array is size 2 (since length is 1, so 1+1=2). \n\ndigits[0] is the first character of reversed \"0\", which is '0', so 0. \n\ndigits[1] is 0 (initialized). \n\nThen, the loop starts with i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0, not 10. \n\nThen, since it's less than 5, add 0 to bills (so bills is 0). \n\nNext, i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. \n\nCheck if it's 10? No. \n\nThen, since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. \n\nTotal bills is 0. \n\nSo the output is 0. \n\nWait, but the first program's output is 0 when x is 1, so the second program's input is \"0\", leading to output 0. \n\nAlternatively, if the first program's input is 0, then the first program outputs 1. Then the second program's input is \"1\". \n\nProcessing \"1\":\n\ndigits array is size 2. \n\ndigits[0] is 1 (since reversed \"1\" is \"1\", so first character is '1'). \n\ndigits[1] is 0. \n\nLoop runs for i=0 to 1. \n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 1. \n\nNot 10. \n\nSince 1 <5, add 1 to bills (now 1). \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. \n\nAdd 0. \n\nTotal bills is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is 1. \n\nSo the overall sequence would be:\n\nIf input to first program is 1 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 second program outputs 0 \u2192 final output is 0.\n\nIf input is 0 \u2192 first outputs 1 \u2192 second outputs 1 \u2192 final output is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose the first program's input is 2 \u2192 output is 1. Then the second program's input is \"1\", so output is 1. \n\nWait, but let's see another example. Suppose the first program's input is 5 \u2192 output is 1 (since 5 !=1 \u2192 result is 1). Then the second program's input is \"1\", so output is 1. \n\nHmm, but maybe I need to see what the second program does when given a longer input. But in this case, the first program's output is always a single digit (0 or 1), so the second program's input is a single-digit string. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's behavior is: \n\nThe final output is the same as the second program's output when given the first program's output as input. \n\nSo the first program's output is either 0 or 1, and the second program's output is either 0 or 1, depending on the input. \n\nWait, but let me see for input 1 to first program: output is 0 \u2192 second program's input is \"0\" \u2192 output 0. \n\nInput 0 \u2192 first outputs 1 \u2192 second outputs 1. \n\nInput 2 \u2192 first outputs 1 \u2192 second outputs 1. \n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is \"1\", then the second program's input is \"1\", so the second program's output is 1. \n\nWait, so the entire sequence's final output is equal to the first program's output. Because the second program's output is the same as the first's output. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recheck. \n\nWait, when first program outputs 0, second program's input is \"0\" \u2192 output is 0. \n\nWhen first outputs 1 \u2192 second outputs 1. \n\nSo the final output is the same as the first program's output. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the second program is doing nothing? But that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the second program's code when input is \"1\". \n\nProcessing \"1\":\n\ndigits array is size 2. \n\ndigits[0] = 1 (from the first character of reversed \"1\"), digits[1] =0. \n\nLoop runs for i from 0 to 1 (since length is 1, so i up to 1). \n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 1. \n\nNot 10. \n\nSince 1 <5 \u2192 add 1 to bills (bills becomes 1). \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. \n\nAdd 0. \n\nTotal bills is 1. \n\nSo yes, the output is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is the same as the first's output. \n\nWait, so the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the second program is redundant? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the second program's code. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the second program's code has a loop that goes up to number.length(). \n\nWait, the input is a string, so for input \"0\", the length is 1. So the loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\nWait, in the case of input \"0\", the digits array is [0,0]. \n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal is 0. \n\nSo yes, the output is 0. \n\nSo the second program's output is the same as the first's output. \n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. \n\nWait, but that's strange. So the second program is just returning the same value? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me recheck the first program. \n\nThe first program's code:\n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n\nboolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n\nint result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nSo, if x is 1 \u2192 bool is true \u2192 !bool is false \u2192 result is 0. \n\nElse, result is 1. \n\nSo the first program's output is 1 when x is not 1, else 0. \n\nThe second program's output is the same as the first's output. \n\nSo the entire sequence's output is the same as the first's output. \n\nWait, but then why have the second program? Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code is different. Let me re-examine the second program's code again. \n\nWait, the second program's code has a loop that processes each digit, and the bills variable is being calculated. Let me see for input \"1\":\n\ndigits array is [1,0]. \n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 1 \u2192 less than 5 \u2192 add 1 to bills (bills is 1). \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal is 1. \n\nSo yes, output is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is same as first's. \n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is same as first's. \n\nWait, but then the second program is redundant. But perhaps the problem is that the first program's output is a single digit, so the second program's processing is trivial. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. \n\nWait, but the user wants to translate the entire sequence into a single C program. So the C program should read the input (the x value), compute the first program's result, then pass it to the second program's processing, and output the second's result. \n\nBut according to the analysis, the second program's result is the same as the first's. So the final output is the same as the first's. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the second program's code has a loop that processes each digit. Let me see for input \"0\":\n\ndigits array is [0,0]. \n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal is 0. \n\nSo yes, output is 0. \n\nSo the second program's output is same as first's. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just compute the first program's result and output it. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the second program is redundant. But perhaps the problem is that the second program is not supposed to be run on the first's output, but the first's output is the input to the second. \n\nWait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. \n\nSo the first program's output is a number (0 or 1), which is then given as input to the second program. \n\nThe second program's input is a string (number = sc.next()), so the input is \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nThe second program processes that input and outputs a number. \n\nAs per the analysis, the second program's output is the same as the first's. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first's. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just compute the first's result and output it. \n\nBut that seems too simple. Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code is different. Let me re-examine the second program's code again. \n\nWait, the second program's code has a loop that processes each digit, and there's a part where if the digit is 5, it checks the next digit. \n\nWait, let's take an example where the input is \"5\". \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first program's output can only be 0 or 1, so the second program's input is either \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nSo in those cases, the second program's output is same as first's. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is same as first's. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just read the input x, compute (x !=1) ? 1 :0, and output that. \n\nBut the user wants the entire sequence translated into a single C program. \n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again. \n\nThe first program's code:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 :0. \n\nbool is true when x is 1. \n\nSo when x is 1 \u2192 !bool is false \u2192 result is 0. \n\nElse \u2192 result is 1. \n\nSo the first program's output is 1 - (x ==1). \n\nSo the final output is the same as the first's. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just do that. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just read x, compute the result as (x !=1) ? 1 :0, and print it. \n\nBut why would the second program be part of the sequence then? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's analysis. Let me think of another input. \n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"10\". Wait, but the first program's output can only be 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the first program's output is either 0 or 1, so the second program's input is a single-digit string. \n\nTherefore, the second program's processing is straightforward. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second program's code is more complex, but in the case of single-digit input, it's equivalent. \n\nTherefore, the C program can be written as follows: \n\nRead an integer x from input. \n\nCompute result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0. \n\nPrint the result. \n\nBut the user wants the entire sequence translated, so even if the second program's processing is redundant, we have to model it. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that behaves identically. \n\nTherefore, even if the second program's processing is redundant, we have to model it. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Read x from input. \n\n2. Compute first program's result (0 or 1). \n\n3. Take that result as input to the second program. \n\n4. Compute the second program's result. \n\n5. Output that. \n\nBut according to the analysis, step 4's result is same as step 2's. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just do step 2 and output it. \n\nBut perhaps the second program's code has some edge cases. Let me think of input \"0\" to the second program. \n\nWait, the second program's code for input \"0\" gives 0, which is same as first's output. \n\nAnother example: first program's input is 0 \u2192 output 1 \u2192 second program's input is \"1\" \u2192 output 1. \n\nSo the final output is 1. \n\nSo the entire sequence's output is same as first's. \n\nTherefore, the C program can just compute the first's result and output it. \n\nBut the user wants the entire sequence translated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second program's code is more complex, but in the context of the first's output, it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me re-examine the code again. \n\nLooking at the second program's code:\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to number.length(). \n\nWait, the digits array is of size number.length() +1. \n\nThe loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++). \n\nWait, the number.length() is the length of the input string. \n\nSo for input \"0\", the loop runs from 0 to 1 (since length is 1). \n\nThe code first checks if digits[i] is 10. \n\nInitially, digits are 0-9. \n\nBut during the loop, when processing previous digits, maybe digits[i] can become 10. \n\nWait, let's see for input \"9\". \n\nWait, but first program's output can't be 9. \n\nWait, but let's imagine a hypothetical case where the first program's output is \"9\". \n\nThen the second program's input is \"9\". \n\ndigits array would be of size 2 (since length is 1). \n\ndigits[0] =9, digits[1]=0. \n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9. \n\nSince 9>5, so carry over: digits[1] becomes 1, and bills += 10-9 =1. \n\nThen, after that, the code proceeds. \n\nThen, i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is now 1. \n\nSo add 1 to bills. \n\nTotal bills would be 1+1=2. \n\nWait, but that's just an example. \n\nBut in our case, the first program's output is only 0 or 1. \n\nSo the second program's processing for those cases is straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the C program can be written as follows: \n\nRead x from input. \n\nresult = (x !=1) ? 1 :0; \n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", result); \n\nBut the user wants the entire sequence translated, so perhaps the second program's code must be included even if it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me re-express the second program's code in C. \n\nThe second program's code takes a string (the first program's output, which is either \"0\" or \"1\"), processes it as follows: \n\n- Reverse the digits (but since it's a single digit, reversed is same). \n\n- Then process each digit (including a trailing zero). \n\nWait, the code's first step is to reverse the digits. \n\nWait, the code does: \n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo for \"0\", the reversed digits are the same. \n\nBut for a two-digit number like \"12\", it would reverse to 21. \n\nBut in our case, the input is a single digit, so the reversed digits are the same. \n\nSo the digits array for input \"0\" is [0,0]. \n\nThen, the loop processes each digit. \n\nThe code's processing for each digit is: \n\nFirst, check if the digit is 10. \n\nBut initially, digits are 0-9. \n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, add to bills. \n\nWait, but in the case of input \"0\", the first digit is 0, so add 0. \n\nThe second digit (digits[1]) is 0, so add 0. \n\nTotal is 0. \n\nSo the second program's output is 0. \n\nSo the entire sequence's output is 0 when first's output is 0. \n\nThus, the C program can be written as follows: \n\nRead x, compute result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0, then output that. \n\nBut the user wants the entire sequence translated into a single C program. \n\nTherefore, even if the second program's processing is redundant, we have to model it. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first compute the first program's result, then pass it to the second program's processing. \n\nSo the steps in C would be: \n\n1. Read x from input. \n\n2. Compute first_result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0. \n\n3. Convert first_result to a string (since the second program's input is a string). \n\n4. Process that string through the second program's algorithm. \n\n5. Output the final result. \n\nTherefore, the C program must first compute the first's result, then process it through the second's algorithm. \n\nSo even though the second's processing for 0 and 1 gives the same result, we have to model it. \n\nTherefore, the C program must do the following steps: \n\n- Read the input integer x. \n\n- Compute first_result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0. \n\n- Convert first_result to a string (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\"). \n\n- Process this string through the second program's algorithm. \n\n- Output the result of the second's processing. \n\nSo the second's algorithm must be implemented in C. \n\nTherefore, the C program will have to: \n\n- Read x, compute first_result. \n\n- Then, process the string representation of first_result through the second's algorithm. \n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the second program's algorithm in C. \n\nThe second program's algorithm steps: \n\nGiven a string (number), which is the first_result's string (either \"0\" or \"1\"). \n\nProcess the digits as follows: \n\n1. Reverse the digits and store in an array of size length+1. \n\nWait, the code in Java does: \n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0'; \n\nSo for each i from 0 to length-1, the digits array is filled with the reversed digits. \n\nThen, the digits array has an extra element (digits[length] is 0 initially). \n\nThen, process each digit from 0 to length (inclusive). \n\nThe processing loop: \n\nfor each i from 0 to length: \n\n   if digits[i] ==10 \u2192 carry over. \n\n   then, depending on the digit's value, add to bills. \n\nWait, but initially, digits are 0-9. \n\nWait, the first step in the loop is to check if digits[i] is 10. \n\nBut initially, digits are 0-9. \n\nSo this can only happen if in a previous iteration, digits[i] was set to 10. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAh, because when processing previous digits, when you add to digits[i+1], it might cause digits[i+1] to become 10. \n\nWait, let me think of an example where this can happen. \n\nSuppose the input is \"5\". \n\nThen, the digits array after reversing would be [5,0]. \n\nProcessing i=0: \n\ndigits[0] is 5. \n\nSince it's equal to 5, check if the next digit (digits[1]) is >=5. \n\ndigits[1] is 0, which is less than 5. \n\nSo we add 5 to bills (bills becomes 5). \n\nThen, since digits[1] is 0, which is less than 5, no carry. \n\nThen, i=1: \n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills is 5. \n\nWait, but in this case, the second program's output would be 5. \n\nBut in our case, the first program's output can't be 5. \n\nBut the code's logic is more complex. \n\nTherefore, to implement the second program's algorithm in C, we need to: \n\n- Take the first_result (0 or 1), convert to a string. \n\n- Process that string through the algorithm. \n\nSo let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, in C: \n\nRead x from input. \n\nCompute first_result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0; \n\nThen, create a string (char array) of the first_result. \n\nThen, process this string through the second's algorithm. \n\nThe second's algorithm steps: \n\n1. Read the input string (number). \n\n2. Reverse the digits and store in an array of size length+1. \n\n3. Process each digit (including the extra 0 at the end) to compute bills. \n\nSo in C code: \n\nFirst, the input string is the first_result's string. \n\nLet me think of the steps in code. \n\nFirst, the first_result is an integer (0 or 1). \n\nWe can convert it to a string using sprintf. \n\nchar input_str[2]; \n\nsprintf(input_str, \"%d\", first_result); \n\nThen, the length is strlen(input_str). \n\nThen, create the digits array. \n\nint len = strlen(input_str); \n\nint *digits = malloc( (len+1)*sizeof(int) ); \n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) { \n\n    digits[i] = input_str[ len -1 -i ] - '0'; \n\n} \n\ndigits[len] =0; \n\nThen, process the digits array. \n\nint bills =0; \n\nfor (int i=0; i <= len; i++) { \n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { \n\n        digits[i+1]++; \n\n        digits[i] =0; \n\n    } \n\n    if (digits[i] <5) { \n\n        bills += digits[i]; \n\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) { \n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) { \n\n            digits[i+1]++; \n\n        } \n\n        bills +=5; \n\n    } else { \n\n        digits[i+1]++; \n\n        bills +=10 - digits[i]; \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nWait, but in the loop, after handling the digits[i] ==10 case, we then process the digit's value. \n\nWait, but in the code, the first check is for digits[i] ==10, and then the other conditions are after that. \n\nWait, the code in Java is: \n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... } \n\nthen, \n\nif (digits[i] <5) ... \n\nelse if (digits[i]==5) ... \n\nelse ... \n\nSo in C, the code would be: \n\nfor each i from 0 to len: \n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { \n\n        digits[i+1]++; \n\n        digits[i] =0; \n\n    } \n\n    // Now process the digit's value \n\n    if (digits[i] <5) { \n\n        bills += digits[i]; \n\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) { \n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) { \n\n            digits[i+1]++; \n\n        } \n\n        bills +=5; \n\n    } else { \n\n        digits[i+1]++; \n\n        bills +=10 - digits[i]; \n\n    } \n\nWait, but after the first check (digits[i] ==10), the digits[i] is set to 0, so the subsequent conditions will use the updated value. \n\nWait, but in the code, after handling the 10 case, the digit is now 0, so the next condition (digits[i] <5) will be true. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, putting this all together. \n\nThe C program will: \n\n- Read x from stdin. \n\n- Compute first_result. \n\n- Convert to string. \n\n- Process through the second's algorithm. \n\n- Output the bills. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nFirst, the code structure: \n\n#include <stdio.h> \n\n#include <string.h> \n\nint main() { \n\n    int x; \n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x); \n\n    int first_result = (x !=1) ? 1 :0; \n\n    // Now process first_result through second's algorithm \n\n    char input_str[2]; \n\n    sprintf(input_str, \"%d\", first_result); \n\n    int len = strlen(input_str); \n\n    int digits[len+1]; \n\n    for (int i=0; i < len; i++) { \n\n        digits[i] = input_str[len -1 -i] - '0'; \n\n    } \n\n    digits[len] =0; \n\n    int bills =0; \n\n    for (int i=0; i <= len; i++) { \n\n        if (digits[i] ==10) { \n\n            digits[i+1]++; \n\n            digits[i] =0; \n\n        } \n\n        if (digits[i] <5) { \n\n            bills += digits[i]; \n\n        } else if (digits[i] ==5) { \n\n            if (digits[i+1] >=5) { \n\n                digits[i+1]++; \n\n            } \n\n            bills +=5; \n\n        } else { \n\n            digits[i+1]++; \n\n            bills +=10 - digits[i]; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", bills); \n\n    return 0; \n\n} \n\nWait, but in C, the array digits is declared as int digits[len+1]; but variable-length arrays (VLAs) are allowed in C99, but not in all compilers. \n\nAlternatively, since the first_result is either 0 or 1, the length is 1. \n\nSo len is 1. \n\nTherefore, the digits array can be of size 2. \n\nSo perhaps we can hardcode it. \n\nAlternatively, since the first_result is a single digit, the code can be optimized. \n\nBut to make it general, even if the first program's output is a longer number (though in this case it's not), the code should handle it. \n\nBut since the first program's output is only 0 or 1, the length is 1. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written with len=1. \n\nBut let's proceed with the code as written. \n\nWait, but in the code above, the digits array is declared as int digits[len+1]; which is okay in C99. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid VLAs, we can use a fixed size array. \n\nSince the first_result is a single digit, the maximum length is 1. \n\nSo the digits array can be of size 2. \n\nSo: \n\nint digits[2]; \n\ndigits[0] = input_str[0] - '0'; // since reversed, but for length 1, it's same. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for input_str of length 1, the loop for i from 0 to 0 (since len is 1). \n\ndigits[0] = input_str[1-1 -0] - '0' \u2192 input_str[0] - '0'. \n\ndigits[1] =0. \n\nSo the code is okay. \n\nTherefore, the code should work. \n\nTesting with input 1: \n\nfirst_result is 0 \u2192 input_str is \"0\". \n\nlen is 1. \n\ndigits[0] = '0' - '0' =0. \n\ndigits[1] =0. \n\nProcessing loop: \n\ni=0: \n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 not 10. \n\ndigits[0] <5 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills 0. \n\ni=1: \n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills 0. \n\nOutput is 0. \n\nWhich matches the expected result. \n\nInput 0: \n\nfirst_result is 1 \u2192 input_str is \"1\". \n\nlen is 1. \n\ndigits[0] =1, digits[1]=0. \n\nProcessing: \n\ni=0: \n\ndigits[0] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills 1. \n\ni=1: \n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total 1. \n\nOutput is 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: input 2 \u2192 first_result is 1 \u2192 output 1. \n\nThus, the code works. \n\nTherefore, the final C program is as written above. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the code is correct. \n\nWait, in the code, the digits array is initialized as: \n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) { \n\n    digits[i] = input_str[len -1 -i] - '0'; \n\n} \n\nFor input_str \"0\" (len=1), this is i=0: \n\ndigits[0] = input_str[0] - '0' \u2192 correct. \n\nFor input_str \"1\", same. \n\nYes. \n\nThe loop for processing digits is correct. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nTherefore, the final C program is as written."
