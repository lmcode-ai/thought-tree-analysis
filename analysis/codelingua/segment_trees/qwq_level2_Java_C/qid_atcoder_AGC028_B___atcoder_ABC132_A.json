    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java file does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (AGC028_B). It reads an integer n, then an array of integers. Then it calculates some values involving permutations and modular inverses. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n2. Compute p as n! mod 1e9+7.\n3. Compute an array q where each element is the sum up to that point plus the modular inverse of (i+1).\n4. Calculate the answer by combining a[i], q values, and p.\n\nThe second Java file (ABC132_A) takes a string input, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read a string s.\n2. Count the frequency of each character.\n3. Check if there are exactly two characters with count 2 each, then output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the problem says the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of the first being the input to the second. Wait, but looking at the first program's output, it prints a number (ans). The second program expects a string input. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Wait, the user says the output of each program is used as input to the next. But the first program outputs a number, and the second expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is the 'ans' variable, which is a number mod 1e9+7. The second program reads a string from input. So how can the first's output be the input to the second? Unless the first program's output is a string that the second can process. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's printing a number. So maybe the first program's output is a number, and the second program is expecting a string. That would mean that the second program is reading that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234\", then the second program would read that as the string \"1234\" and check if it has two characters each appearing twice. But \"1234\" has four characters, so it would output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but the user says that the sequence must be translated into a single C program that behaves the same. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the C program must first process the first program's input, compute its output, then use that output as input to the second program's logic, and finally output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and array a).\n2. Compute the first program's result (the ans value).\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second program's logic (i.e., treat it as a string s).\n4. Then output the second program's result (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, becomes a string. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 12, then the second program would read \"12\" as the string, which has two characters, each appearing once, so it would output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (n and array a).\n- Compute the first program's output (the ans value).\n- Convert that ans into a string (as a string representation).\n- Then process that string through the second program's logic (count characters, check conditions).\n- Finally, output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the C program must combine both steps into one, without I/O in between. The first part's output is the input to the second part's processing.\n\nNow, translating this into C.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (AGC028_B):\n\nThe first part's steps:\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array a.\n\nCompute p = n! mod 1e9+7.\n\nCompute array q where q[0] = 1, and for i from 1 to n-1, q[i] = (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod)) % mod.\n\nThen compute ans as sum over i of ( (q[i] + q[n-i-1] -1) * a[i] ) mod mod, multiplied by p mod mod.\n\nWait, the code in Java for the first part:\n\nThe modinv function is implemented using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Need to translate that into C.\n\nThen, the second part (ABC132_A):\n\nThe input is the string representation of the first's ans. So after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string.\n\nWait, but in C, how do we convert the ans (a long) to a string? We can use sprintf to write it into a buffer.\n\nSo steps in C:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute the first part's ans as per the first Java code.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string s.\n\n4. Process s through the second part's logic: count the characters, check if exactly two distinct characters each with count 2.\n\n5. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, let's structure the C code.\n\nFirst, the modinv function in C. The Java code's modinv is a static method. Let's reimplement that in C.\n\nThe modinv function in Java:\n\nstatic long modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1;\n    long v = 0;\n    long tmp = 0;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n        u -= t * v;\n        tmp = u; u = v; v = tmp;\n    }\n    u %= m;\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u;\n}\n\nHmm, this is the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse. Let me see:\n\nThe variables a and b are being swapped and reduced, and u and v track coefficients. The loop continues until b is 0, then returns u mod m. But in the code, the loop runs while b>0. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's loop condition is while (b >0). Let me see the steps:\n\nInitially, b is m, a is the input a.\n\nThe loop steps:\n\nt = a / b (but after swapping?)\n\nWait, perhaps I should reimplement this in C correctly.\n\nWait, the code's steps:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nt = a / b; // but a and b are being swapped?\n\nWait, let me think of the algorithm steps. The code is implementing the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse of a mod m. The inverse exists only if a and m are coprime, which in this case mod is 1e9+7 (a prime), so as long as a is not a multiple of mod, which it won't be since mod is prime and a is part of the computation.\n\nThe code's variables:\n\nInitially, b is set to m, u starts at 1, v at 0.\n\nThen, in each iteration:\n\nt = a / b;\n\na = a - t*b; // which is the remainder of a divided by b.\n\nThen, swap a and b with tmp. Wait, the code does:\n\ntmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, after a -= t*b, the code does:\n\ntmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n\nWait, that's equivalent to swapping a and b. So after the subtraction, the new a becomes the old b, and the new b is the remainder (a - t*b).\n\nThen, for the u and v variables:\n\nu -= t * v;\n\nThen, swap u and v with tmp:\n\ntmp = u; u = v; v = tmp;\n\nWait, perhaps the code is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe variables u and v track the coefficients such that a*u + b*v = gcd(a, original m). But I might need to reimplement this correctly in C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to write the modinv function in C. Let me think of the standard implementation.\n\nAlternatively, here's the code in C for modinv:\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1, v = 0;\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b; swap(a, b);\n        u -= t * v; swap(u, v);\n    }\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u % m;\n}\n\nWait, but the swapping is done via a temporary variable. Let me see the original code's steps again.\n\nLooking at the Java code's loop:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nlong t = a / b;\n\na -= t * b; // a becomes a mod b?\n\nThen:\n\ntmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n\nSo after this, the new a is the old b, and the new b is the remainder (a - t*b).\n\nThen, for u and v:\n\nu -= t * v;\n\ntmp = u; u = v; v = tmp;\n\nWait, so after the first part (u -= t*v), then swap u and v.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is equivalent to the standard extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the modinv function in C as follows:\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1, v = 0;\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        long tmp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = tmp % b;\n        tmp = u;\n        u = v;\n        v = tmp - t * v;\n    }\n    if (a != 1) return -1; // no inverse if a and m not coprime, but mod is prime so a is not 0 mod m.\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u % m;\n}\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the code. Alternatively, perhaps the original Java code's implementation can be directly translated.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to translate the Java code's modinv function step by step.\n\nOriginal Java code's modinv:\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1;\n    long v = 0;\n    long tmp = 0;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        tmp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = tmp;\n        u -= t * v;\n        tmp = u;\n        u = v;\n        v = tmp;\n    }\n    u %= m;\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u;\n}\n\nWait, let's see each step in the loop:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nt = a / b; // quotient of a divided by b.\n\na -= t * b; // a becomes a mod b?\n\nThen, swap a and b:\n\ntmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;\n\nWait, after a -= t*b, the new a is a mod b? Or not exactly, but after swapping, the new a is the old b, and the new b is the remainder (a - t*b).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose original a and b are a_old and b_old.\n\nAfter a -= t*b, the new a is a_old - t*b_old.\n\nThen, we set tmp = a (which is a_old - t*b_old), then a becomes b_old, and b becomes tmp (the remainder).\n\nSo the next iteration's a and b are b_old and (a_old - t*b_old), which is the standard step in the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThen, for the u and v variables:\n\nu -= t * v;\n\nThen, swap u and v via tmp:\n\ntmp = u (which is the new u after subtraction?), then u becomes v, and v becomes tmp (the old u minus t*v).\n\nWait, let's track variables:\n\nOriginal u and v are u_old and v_old.\n\nAfter u -= t*v_old, the new u is u_old - t*v_old.\n\nThen, we swap u and v:\n\ntmp = u (which is u_old - t*v_old)\n\nu becomes v_old.\n\nv becomes tmp (u_old - t*v_old).\n\nSo the new u is v_old, and the new v is (u_old - t*v_old).\n\nHmm, this is the standard way to track coefficients in the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo the code is correct. So in C, the modinv function can be written as:\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1, v = 0;\n    long tmp;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        tmp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = tmp;\n        u -= t * v;\n        tmp = u;\n        u = v;\n        v = tmp;\n    }\n    u %= m;\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, variables are declared at the top. So inside the function, the tmp variables can be declared as needed.\n\nNow, moving on to the first part's code.\n\nThe first part's main steps:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array a.\n\nCompute p as n! mod mod (mod is 1e9+7).\n\nCompute q array.\n\nThen compute ans.\n\nSo in C, the steps would be:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nRead n integers into an array a of size n.\n\nCompute p as factorial mod mod.\n\nCompute q array.\n\nCompute ans.\n\nThen, convert ans to a string s.\n\nThen process s through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second part's logic (ABC132_A):\n\nThe input is the string s (the ans as a string). We need to count the frequency of each character, check if exactly two distinct characters each with count 2.\n\nIn C, to process the string s:\n\n- Convert the ans to a string. Since ans can be up to (mod-1) * n! mod mod, but mod is 1e9+7, so the maximum possible ans is (mod-1)*mod (since n! mod mod can be up to mod-1, and multiplied by (mod-1) again?), but in any case, the number can be up to 1e9+7, so the string can be up to 10 digits (since 1e9 is 10 digits). So a buffer of 20 characters should suffice.\n\nSo steps:\n\nchar s[20];\n\nsprintf(s, \"%ld\", ans);\n\nThen, process the string s.\n\nNow, count the frequency of each character.\n\nWe can use an array of size 256 (for all possible ASCII characters) to count frequencies.\n\nInitialize all counts to 0.\n\nLoop through each character in s:\n\ncounts[c]++;\n\nThen, check:\n\n- The number of distinct characters with count 2 must be exactly 2, and all others zero.\n\nWait, the condition is that exactly two distinct characters each appear exactly twice, and no other characters.\n\nSo:\n\nint count2 = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] == 2) count2++;\n\n    else if (counts[i] !=0) { // any other count is invalid\n\n        ok = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (count2 == 2) then output yes else no.\n\nAlternatively, loop through all counts and check.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, collect all the counts and check.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nint ok = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] != 0 && counts[i] != 2) {\n\n        ok = 0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, also check that the total number of characters is 4 (since two characters each appearing twice). Because the string length must be exactly 4?\n\nWait, the original second Java program's input is a string s. The code counts the frequency of each character. The condition is that the map has exactly two entries, each with value 2. So the total length must be 4 (since 2*2=4). So the string must be of length 4, and each character appears exactly twice.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nThe code first counts the frequency of each character in the string s. Then, it loops through the entries in the map. If any entry's value is not 2, then ok is set to false. Then, after that, it checks if ok is true AND the map's size is exactly 2.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All characters in the string have count exactly 2.\n\n- There are exactly two distinct characters.\n\nThus, the string length must be 4 (since 2 chars * 2 counts each).\n\nTherefore, in the C code, after converting ans to a string s, we need to check:\n\n1. The length of s is 4.\n\n2. Each character in s occurs exactly twice.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nint len = strlen(s);\n\nif (len !=4) then ok =0;\n\nelse {\n\n   check counts.\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the length isn't checked directly. The code checks that the map has exactly two entries, each with count 2. So the length is automatically 4, because 2 entries * 2 counts each.\n\nSo in C, perhaps it's better to first check the length is 4, then check the counts.\n\nAlternatively, proceed as per the Java code's logic.\n\nSo steps in C for the second part:\n\nInitialize an array counts[256] = {0}.\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\ncounts[c]++;\n\nThen, check:\n\nint has_two =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n        has_two++;\n\n    } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n        ok =0; break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (ok && has_two ==2) then yes else no.\n\nWait, but the code must also ensure that there are exactly two characters with count 2. So:\n\nInitialize ok to 1.\n\nFirst, check all counts are 0 or 2.\n\nThen, count how many have count 2. If exactly two, then ok.\n\nElse, not.\n\nSo code:\n\nint ok = 1;\n\nint count2 =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n    if (counts[i] ==2) {\n\n        count2++;\n\n    } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n\n        ok =0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (ok && count2 ==2) {\n\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n\n}\n\nBut also, the length of the string must be exactly 4. Because 2 characters * 2 each =4.\n\nWait, but in the code above, if the string is longer than 4, then counts would have some counts not 2. For example, if the string is \"12345\", then counts for each character is 1, so the code would set ok to 0.\n\nBut if the string is \"1122\", then counts for '1' and '2' are 2 each, so it's okay.\n\nBut if the string is \"1112\", then counts for '1' is 3, so it's invalid.\n\nThus, the code above would handle it correctly.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe C program structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    // implement the modinv function as above\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n]; // assuming variable length arrays are okay, or use malloc. But in C99, VLAs are allowed.\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    // compute p = n! mod mod\n    const int mod = 1000000007;\n    long p =1;\n    for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n        p = p * i % mod;\n    }\n\n    // compute q array\n    long q[n];\n    q[0] =1;\n    for (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n        long inv = modinv(i+1, mod);\n        q[i] = (q[i-1] + inv) % mod;\n    }\n\n    // compute ans\n    long ans =0;\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n        long val = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1) % mod;\n        val *= a[i];\n        val %= mod;\n        val *= p;\n        val %= mod;\n        ans += val;\n        ans %= mod;\n    }\n\n    // convert ans to string\n    char s[20];\n    sprintf(s, \"%ld\", ans);\n\n    // process the string s through the second part's logic\n    int counts[256] = {0};\n    for (int i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        counts[s[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int ok =1;\n    int count2 =0;\n    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n        if (counts[i] ==2) {\n            count2++;\n        } else if (counts[i] !=0) {\n            ok =0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (ok && count2 ==2) {\n        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code for q array:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the q array is initialized as q[0] =1, and for i from 1 to n-1:\n\nq[i] = (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod)) % mod;\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=1; i <n; i++), so i runs from 1 to n-1 inclusive. The index i in the array is up to n-1, which is correct.\n\nIn the C code, the q array is declared as long q[n], which is okay.\n\nNow, the modinv function in C must be correctly implemented.\n\nWait, in the modinv function, the parameters are a and m. The original Java function's m is an int (mod is 1e9+7). So in C, the function can take an int for m.\n\nWait, in the code above, the modinv function is declared as:\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 12, which is \"12\" as a string. The length is 2, so the second part would output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: if the first program's output is 1122, then the string is \"1122\", which has two characters each appearing twice. So output \"Yes\".\n\nWait, but 1122 is 4 digits. So that would work.\n\nAnother case: 1212 \u2192 \"1212\" \u2192 counts for '1' is 2, '2' is 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case: 1111 \u2192 counts for '1' is 4 \u2192 no.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The modinv function must handle a and m correctly. Since mod is a prime, and the a in modinv is (i+1) which ranges from 2 to n. Since n can be up to... Well, the first program's n is read from input, but in the code, the mod is 1e9+7, so as long as i+1 is not 0 mod mod, which it won't be since i+1 is up to n, which is presumably less than mod.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 1e9+7? Probably not, but the code should handle it as per the problem's constraints. Since the first Java program uses an array of size n, which in C would be a problem if n is large. But the problem probably expects that the code works for the given input, so assuming n is manageable.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting ans to a string, using %ld may not be sufficient if ans is negative, but since mod is 1e9+7, ans is between 0 and mod-1, so it's non-negative.\n\nAnother point: in the first part's ans calculation, the code uses (q[i] + q[n-i-1] -1) mod mod. Since mod is 1e9+7, the subtraction could lead to negative values, so adding mod before modding again.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nval = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1) % mod;\n\nBut in C, the modulo operation can give negative results if the sum is negative. So perhaps better to compute as:\n\nval = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1 + mod) % mod;\n\nTo ensure it's positive.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the expression is (q[i] + q[n-i-1] -1). Since q[i] and q[n-i-1] are mod mod, their sum can be up to 2*mod, but subtracting 1 could make it negative? Let's see:\n\nSuppose q[i] is 0 and q[n-i-1] is 0. Then 0+0-1 = -1. mod is 1e9+7, so mod(-1, mod) would be mod-1. But in Java, the % operator returns a non-negative result. Wait, in Java, (a % m) is always in [0, m-1], so even if the value is negative, it's adjusted.\n\nIn C, the % operator can return negative results if the numerator is negative. So to ensure that (a + b -1) mod mod is correctly computed as a non-negative value, we can add mod before taking mod again.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nval = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1 + mod) % mod;\n\nThis ensures that even if the sum is negative, adding mod before modding gives the correct positive value.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, the line:\n\nval = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1) % mod;\n\nshould be changed to:\n\nval = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1 + mod) % mod;\n\nOtherwise, if the sum is negative, mod could give a negative value, leading to incorrect results.\n\nSo that's a correction needed.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop for p:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    p = p * i % mod;\n\n}\n\nIn C, the loop is the same. But if n is 0 or 1, but the first program's input would have n as per the problem's constraints. Probably n is at least 1, but the code should handle n=0? Not sure, but the problem's original code may have constraints.\n\nNow, putting all corrections into the code.\n\nThe corrected C code would have:\n\nIn the ans calculation loop:\n\nlong val = (q[i] + q[n -i -1] -1 + mod) % mod;\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the full code with corrections:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nlong modinv(long a, int m) {\n    long b = m;\n    long u = 1, v = 0;\n    long tmp;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        tmp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = tmp;\n        u -= t * v;\n        tmp = u;\n        u = v;\n        v = tmp;\n    }\n    u %= m;\n    if (u < 0) u += m;\n    return u;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    const int mod = 1000000007;\n    long p = 1;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        p = p * i % mod;\n    }\n\n    long q[n];\n    q[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        long inv = modinv(i + 1, mod);\n        q[i] = (q[i - 1] + inv) % mod;\n    }\n\n    long ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        long val = (q[i] + q[n - i - 1] - 1 + mod) % mod; // added mod to prevent negative\n        val *= a[i];\n        val %= mod;\n        val *= p;\n        val %= mod;\n        ans += val;\n        ans %= mod;\n    }\n\n    char s[20];\n    sprintf(s, \"%ld\", ans);\n\n    int counts[256] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        counts[s[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int ok = 1;\n    int count2 = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (counts[i] == 2) {\n            count2++;\n        } else if (counts[i] != 0) {\n            ok = 0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (ok && count2 == 2) {\n        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The modinv function: in the loop, when b becomes zero, the loop exits. The code then returns u mod m, which should be correct.\n\n- The q array's calculation: for i from 1 to n-1, the inv is modinv(i+1, mod). Since i starts at 1, i+1 starts at 2, up to n.\n\n- The ans calculation uses the corrected val line.\n\n- The string conversion uses sprintf, which should work as long as the buffer is big enough. For numbers up to 1e9+7, the maximum length is 10 digits (since 1e9 is 10 digits), so 20 is sufficient.\n\n- The counts array is properly initialized to zero.\n\n- The loop over counts checks all possible characters, and counts how many have exactly two occurrences.\n\nThis should handle all cases correctly."
