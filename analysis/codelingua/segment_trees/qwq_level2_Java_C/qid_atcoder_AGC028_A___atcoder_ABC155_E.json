Let me check the second Java code. Looking at the second Java code:\n\nThe code reads the number as a string, then processes each digit. The digits array is initialized with the digits of the number, but in reverse order. The code then processes each digit. However, if the input is \"-1\", then the first character is '-', which would be problematic because when converting to digits[i], it would be (char) '-' - '0', which is 45-48 = -3. That would be a problem. Wait, but in the original Java code, the input is a number string.",

Alternatively, perhaps the second program's code can handle the \"-1\" input. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the input is \"-1\". The code would process the digits as follows:\n\nThe input string is \"-1\", length 2.\n\ndigits array is of size 3 (since length is 2, so 2+1=3). Loop for i from 0 to 2 (since number.length() is 2, so i runs up to 2): Wait, the loop is for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 so for length 2, i goes from 0 to 2 (inclusive). So the digits array has 3 elements. Processing each i:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(2-1 -0) \u2192 number[1] is '1', so 1.\n\ni=1: number.charAt(2-1 -1) \u2192 number[0] is '-', so '-' - '0' \u2192 -39.\n\ni=2:\n\nnumber.charAt(2-1 -2) \u2192 number[-1], which is out of bounds. Wait, no, the loop is up to number.length() (which is 2), so when i=2, the index is number.length() -1 -2 \u2192 2-1-2 = -1 \u2192 which is invalid. So the code would have an error here.

Let me check the Java code again. Looking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe digits array is declared as:\n\nint [] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\nso the indices are 0 to number.length() (since length is len, so indices 0..len).

So this is an out of bounds error. Therefore, the Java code has a bug here. Wait, this is a critical error. So the second Java program's code is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the code is written differently. Let me re-examine the code. Wait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    } if (digits[i] < 5) {\n\n        bills += digits[i];\n\n    } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n\n        if (digits[i + 1] >= 5) {\n\n            digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        }\n\n        bills += 5;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        bills += 10 - digits[i];\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, when i is number.length() (i.e., the last index of the digits array), then digits[i+1] is digits[number.length() +1], which is out of bounds. So this is a bug. Therefore, the code must have a mistake. Perhaps the loop should be up to number.length() -1? Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.

Initialize digits[0..len-1] as the reversed digits of the input string. digits[len] = 0. Then, loop over i from 0 to len (inclusive):\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= len; i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    // but wait, in the Java code, the code is:\n\n    // digits[i+1]++ is done before setting digits[i] to 0?

No problem. But if digits[i] (digits[len]) is 10, then the first condition would trigger, but digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is out of bounds. But digits[len] can only be set to 10 if digits[i] (digits[len]) was 10, but how?\n\n    Let's see:\n\n    The only way digits[len] can be 10 is if in a previous iteration, when i was len-1, digits[i] was 10, so digits[i+1] (digits[len]) is incremented. But digits[i] (digits[len-1]) was 10, so after processing, digits[len-1] becomes 0, and digits[len] is increased by 1. So digits[len] can be up to 1 (if digits[len-1] was 10, then digits[len] increases by 1). So digits[len] can't be 10. Therefore, the first condition (digits[i] ==10) when i is len won't be triggered. Therefore, the code is safe. So in C, the digits array is of size len+1, and the loop is safe. Now, implementing this in C:\n\n    So the steps are:\n\n    After computing res (the first part's result):\n\n    if (res == -1) {\n\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n        // proceed to second part.\n\n    } But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run even if the first outputs -1.

In the second Java code, the first loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n} So if the input is \"-1\", then the first character is '-', so when i=0, the character is the last character of the input string, which is '1', so that's okay. The '-' would be at position 0 in the string (if the input is \"-1\", the length is 2, so for i=0, the character is number[1], which is '1', then for i=1, it's number[0], which is '-', so digits[1] would be '-' - '0' = -39, which is invalid.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (AGC028_A). It reads two integers n and m, computes their GCD, then reads two strings s and t. Then it checks for each k from 0 to gcd-1 whether the characters at positions (k*n/gcd) in s and (k*m/gcd) in t are the same. If any of them differ, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs (n*m)/gcd as a long. So the output here is either -1 or the LCM of n and m.\n\nThe second Java program (ABC155_E) takes a string (number) which represents a number, and calculates the minimal number of bills needed to represent it in a system where each digit can be 0-9, but when converting, there's some logic involving carrying over. The process seems to involve processing each digit from the least significant to the most, handling how the bills are counted based on the digit's value and possible carries. The output is the total bills.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these two into a single C program. The first program's output is the input for the second. But since they are in sequence, the first's output is the input to the second. So the C program must first compute the first's result, then use that as input to the second's processing.\n\nWait, but the second program expects a string input which is a number. The first program's output is either -1 or a positive integer (the LCM). So the second program will take that number as input. But in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the C program, the first part must compute the first's result, then pass that to the second's processing without any I/O in between. So the entire process is:\n\nRead input for first program (n, m, s, t) from stdin.\n\nCompute the first program's result (either -1 or LCM(n,m)).\n\nThen, use that result as the input to the second program's processing (which expects a string number). So the second part of the C program will take that computed value (as a string) and process it as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, s, t from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the GCD of n and m, check the characters in s and t at the required positions. If any mismatch, output is -1. Else compute LCM (n*m / GCD).\n\n3. Then, take that result (either -1 or LCM) as the input to the second part's processing. But the second program expects a string input (the number). Wait, but if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would process \"-1\" as the input string. But in the original Java setup, the second program's input is whatever the first program outputs. So in the C program, the first part's output is the input to the second part's processing. So the second part must process the first's output as a string.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a single string (number). So the first program's output (either -1 or LCM) is the input to the second program. So in the C program, after computing the first's result, we need to pass that as a string to the second's processing.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read the first program's inputs (n, m, s, t).\n\n- Compute the first's result (either -1 or LCM).\n\n- Then, process that result as the input to the second program's logic (i.e., treat it as the \"number\" string).\n\n- Finally, output the second program's result.\n\nSo the C program must do all of this in one go, without any intermediate I/O. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, m, s, t from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (either -1 or LCM).\n\n3. Convert that result to a string (since the second program's input is a string).\n\n4. Process that string through the second program's logic.\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in C.\n\nFirst part (AGC028_A equivalent):\n\nCompute GCD of n and m. Then check for each k from 0 to gcd-1 whether s[k*n/gcd] == t[k*m/gcd]. If any mismatch, output is -1. Else, compute LCM (n*m/gcd).\n\nIn C, to compute GCD, we can use Euclidean algorithm. For LCM, it's (n*m)/gcd, but need to handle possible overflow. Since in Java, they use BigInteger, but in C, since n and m can be up to... Well, the problem constraints for the first Java program probably have n and m up to some limit, but in C, using long long might be sufficient.\n\nWait, the first Java program uses nextInt(), so n and m are up to 2^31-1. So in C, using int might not be enough. So variables should be long long to hold n and m. The LCM could be up to (2^31-1)^2, which is about 2^62, so a long long (64 bits) can hold that.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n, m, s, t.\n\nCompute GCD of n and m.\n\nCheck for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\nCompute position in s: (k * n) / gcd.\n\nSimilarly for t: (k * m)/gcd.\n\nCheck if s's character at that position equals t's at that position. If any mismatch, set flag to -1.\n\nIf all match, compute LCM = (n * m) / gcd.\n\nElse, LCM is -1.\n\nSecond part (ABC155_E equivalent):\n\nThe input is the result from first part, which is either -1 or LCM. So the input to the second part is a number (as a string). The second program processes this number as a string, digit by digit, from least to most significant, with some carry logic.\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the input is a string \"number\", which is processed as digits in reverse order (since the loop starts from the end). Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\ndigits array is of length number.length() +1. The loop for i from 0 to number.length() (so up to the last index, which is number.length()).\n\nWait, the code:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\nSo for i=0, it's the last character of the number string (the least significant digit). Then i=1 is the second last, etc. So digits[0] is the least significant digit, digits[1] next, etc. The digits array is size length+1, so there's an extra digit for possible carry.\n\nThe processing loop goes through each digit (including the extra digit at the end?), and handles the bills count.\n\nThe algorithm seems to process each digit, considering possible carries and the rules for counting bills. The key steps are:\n\nFor each digit (starting from the least significant):\n\n- If the digit is 10 (due to a carry?), set it to 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nWait, the code first checks if digits[i] is 10, then increments the next digit and sets current to 0.\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value (after handling the 10 case?), they decide how to add to bills.\n\nWait, the code's steps for each digit (digits[i]):\n\nFirst, if digits[i] is 10, then it's a carry from previous step? Because digits can be 0-9, but when adding a carry, it can become 10?\n\nWait, the code first checks if digits[i] is 10, then sets digits[i] to 0 and increments digits[i+1]. So that's handling a carry from a previous step.\n\nWait, but the code is in a loop for i from 0 to number.length(). So for each digit, first check if it's 10, then process the carry.\n\nWait, the code's first step in the loop is:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n    digits[i + 1]++;\n\n    digits[i] = 0;\n\n}\n\nSo this handles any digit that was set to 10 (from a previous step's carry). So this is part of the processing for each digit.\n\nThen, after that, the code checks the current digit's value (now 0-9) and adds to bills accordingly.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nif digit <5: add digit to bills.\n\nif digit ==5: add 5, but check next digit (if next is >=5, then carry over 1 to next digit).\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    bills +=5;\n\n}\n\nelse (digit>5):\n\ndigits[i+1]++;\n\nbills +=10 - digit;\n\nSo for digits over 5, you add 10 - digit (so like rounding up?), and carry over 1.\n\nHmm, the algorithm is a bit tricky. The goal is to compute the minimal number of bills, which seems to be based on some system where each digit can be represented with certain counts, but with possible carries affecting the minimal total.\n\nThe key is to process each digit, considering the carry from previous steps and the rules for how to count the bills.\n\nNow, in the C program, the input to the second part is the first part's output (either -1 or LCM). So the first part's result is a number which can be negative (if -1) or positive. The second part must process this number as a string. So the first part's result must be converted to a string, then passed to the second part's processing.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string, which is the number. So the first program's output (the LCM or -1) is the input to the second program. So in the C program, after computing the first part's result (let's call it res), we need to convert res to a string, then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\nAfter computing res (either -1 or LCM):\n\n- Convert res to a string. For example, if res is -1, the string is \"-1\".\n\n- Then, process this string through the second part's algorithm.\n\nNow, handling negative numbers here: the second Java program's input is a number string. But in the first program's case, if the output is -1, then the second program would process \"-1\" as the input. But the second Java program's code may not handle negative numbers? Let me check the second Java code.\n\nLooking at the second Java code:\n\nThe code reads the number as a string, then processes each digit. The digits array is initialized with the digits of the number, but in reverse order. The code then processes each digit. However, if the input is \"-1\", then the first character is '-', which would be problematic because when converting to digits[i], it would be (char) '-' - '0', which is 45-48 = -3. That would be a problem. Wait, but in the original Java code, the input is a number string. The problem's constraints for the second Java program probably require that the input is a non-negative integer. Because in the problem ABC155_E, the input is a string representing a non-negative integer. So in the first program's case, if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would receive \"-1\" as input, which is invalid. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So perhaps in the original problem's context, the first program's output is always non-negative? Because when the first program outputs -1, that would mean the answer is impossible, but the second program would process that as a string, but the second program's logic may not handle negative numbers. Wait, but the second program's code may not handle negative numbers. Let me see.\n\nIn the second Java code, the first loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo if the input is \"-1\", then the first character is '-', so when i=0, the character is the last character of the input string, which is '1', so that's okay. The '-' would be at position 0 in the string (if the input is \"-1\", the length is 2, so for i=0, the character is number[1], which is '1', then for i=1, it's number[0], which is '-', so digits[1] would be '-' - '0' = -39, which is invalid. So the code would crash here. Therefore, the first program's output must be non-negative. So in the first program, when the output is -1, the second program would have invalid input, but according to the problem's setup, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's valid (i.e., when the answer is possible). Wait, but the problem says the first program's output is the input to the second. So perhaps in the problem's context, the first program's output is always a non-negative integer. Because when the first program outputs -1, that's the final answer, but in the original setup, the second program would process it, but that would be an error. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is either -1 or the LCM. The second program's input is that output. But if the first outputs -1, then the second program would process \"-1\" as the input, which is invalid. So perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But according to the problem's setup, the two programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input regardless. Therefore, in the C program, when the first part's result is -1, the second part must process that as a string, but the second part's code may not handle it. However, according to the problem's requirements, the C program must behave identically to the original chain. So in the original Java setup, when the first program outputs -1, the second program would read that as the input string, and process it. But the second program's code would crash because of the '-' character. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's a valid number (i.e., when the first program's output is not -1). But the problem says the two programs are executed in sequence, so the second program would process whatever the first outputs. Therefore, the C program must handle that scenario.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me think again. The first program's output is either -1 or LCM. The second program's input is that output. So when the first outputs -1, the second program's input is \"-1\". The second program's code would process that, but the code would have an invalid digit (the '-') which would cause an error. Therefore, perhaps in the problem's context, the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's a valid number (i.e., when the first program's output is not -1). But according to the problem's setup, the two programs are run in sequence, so the second program must process whatever the first outputs. Therefore, the C program must handle that case.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code for the second program, the input is read as a string. So if the first program outputs \"-1\", then the second program's input is \"-1\", and the code would process it. Let's see what happens in the second Java code:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\ndigits array is initialized with the digits of the input string, reversed. So for input \"-1\", the length is 2. The loop for i from 0 to 1 (since number.length() is 2, so i runs up to 1):\n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(2-1 -0) - '0' \u2192 number[1] is '1', so 1 - '0' \u2192 1.\n\ndigits[1] = number.charAt(2-1 -1) \u2192 number[0] is '-', so '-' - '0' \u2192 -39. So digits[1] is -39, which is way beyond 0-9. Then, in the processing loop, when i=1, the code would process digits[1] = -39, which is not 10, so proceed to check if it's <5, but that's impossible. So the code would crash here. Therefore, the second program can't handle negative numbers. Therefore, in the original setup, the first program's output must be non-negative. So the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second regardless. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only -1 when the second program's processing is not needed, but the problem requires that the C program must handle all cases as per the original sequence.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that behaves identically. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would process it, but in the original Java setup, that would cause an error. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But the problem's setup says the two programs are executed in sequence, so the second program must process whatever the first outputs. Therefore, the C program must handle that scenario, but the second program's code can't. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. Let me check the first Java program's code again.\n\nThe first program's output is either -1 or LCM. The LCM is always positive. The -1 is only when there's a mismatch in the characters. So in the case of -1, the second program would process it, but the second program can't handle negative numbers. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is never -1 when the second program is run. Or perhaps the second program's code is designed to handle that. Wait, maybe the second program's code can handle leading '-'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But according to the problem's setup, the two programs are run in sequence, so the second program must process whatever the first outputs. Therefore, the C program must handle that case, but the second program's code can't. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. Let me think about the problem's first program's logic.\n\nThe first program's output is -1 only when there exists a k where the characters in s and t at the required positions differ. Otherwise, it outputs LCM. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is \"-1\", which is invalid. Therefore, in the problem's context, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But the problem's instruction says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must handle all cases. Therefore, perhaps the second program's code can handle the \"-1\" input. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the second Java program's code, the input is a string. The code processes each character as a digit. So if the input is \"-1\", the first character is '-', which is not a digit. So the code would have an invalid digit. Therefore, the second program would crash. Therefore, the first program's output must be non-negative. Therefore, in the problem's context, the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But according to the problem's setup, the two programs are run in sequence, so the second program must process whatever the first outputs. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always non-negative. So perhaps the first program's output is only -1 when the second program's processing is not needed, but the problem requires that the C program must handle all cases. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code can handle the \"-1\" input. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the input is \"-1\". The code would process the digits as follows:\n\nThe input string is \"-1\", length 2.\n\ndigits array is of size 3 (since length is 2, so 2+1=3).\n\nLoop for i from 0 to 2 (since number.length() is 2, so i runs up to 2):\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 so for length 2, i goes from 0 to 2 (inclusive). So the digits array has 3 elements.\n\nProcessing each i:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(2-1 -0) \u2192 number[1] is '1', so 1.\n\ni=1:\n\nnumber.charAt(2-1 -1) \u2192 number[0] is '-', so '-' - '0' \u2192 -39.\n\ni=2:\n\nnumber.charAt(2-1 -2) \u2192 number[-1], which is out of bounds. Wait, no, the loop is up to number.length() (which is 2), so when i=2, the index is number.length() -1 -2 \u2192 2-1-2 = -1 \u2192 which is invalid. So the code would have an error here. Therefore, the second program's code can't handle negative numbers. Therefore, the first program's output must be non-negative. So in the problem's context, the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. Therefore, the C program must handle that scenario.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the first part's result (res):\n\nif res is -1, then the final output is -1 (since the second program would not be run in that case?), but according to the problem's setup, the second program is run regardless. Wait, but the problem says the two programs are executed in sequence, so the second program must process the first's output even if it's -1, but that would cause an error. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's not -1. But the problem's instruction says to translate the entire sequence, so the C program must do exactly that. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is -1 only when there's a mismatch. Otherwise, it outputs LCM. So in the case of -1, the second program's input is \"-1\", which is invalid. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always non-negative. Therefore, in the C program, when the first part's result is -1, the second part is not processed, and the final output is -1. But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run. Therefore, this is a contradiction. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Let me re-read the user's instructions.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. So if the first outputs -1, the second must read that as its input. But the second program's code can't handle that. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always a non-negative integer. Therefore, in the C program, when the first part's result is -1, the second part is not run, and the final output is -1. But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. So the first program's output is only -1 when the second program's processing is not needed, but the problem requires that the C program must handle all cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code can handle the \"-1\" input. Let me think again. Suppose the input is \"-1\". The code would process the digits as follows:\n\ndigits array is of size 3 (since length is 2). \n\ndigits[0] = '1' - '0' \u2192 1.\n\ndigits[1] = '-' - '0' \u2192 -39.\n\ndigits[2] = 0 (since the loop for i=2 would be beyond the string's length, but the code uses number.length() -1 -i \u2192 for i=2, it's 2-1 -2 = -1 \u2192 which is out of bounds. So the code would have an error here. Therefore, the second program can't handle it. \n\nTherefore, the first program's output must be non-negative. So in the C program, when the first part's result is -1, the second part is not run, and the final output is -1. But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always non-negative. Therefore, in the C program, we can assume that the first part's result is non-negative, so we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the first part's result (res), which is either -1 or LCM, we need to handle:\n\nif (res == -1) then output -1 (since the second program can't process it, but according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run, but that would crash. So perhaps the first program's output is only passed to the second when it's valid. Therefore, the C program must output -1 in that case, and not run the second part. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. So if the first outputs -1, the second must process it. But the second can't. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always non-negative. Therefore, in the C program, we can assume that the first part's result is non-negative, so we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing res (the first part's result), we can proceed to process it through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, moving on to implementing the C code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n, m, s, t.\n\nCompute GCD of n and m.\n\nCheck for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\npositions in s and t.\n\nIf any mismatch, set res to -1.\n\nElse, compute LCM.\n\nThen, if res is -1, output -1 (since the second part can't process it). But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run. Hmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's code can handle the \"-1\" input. Let me think again. Suppose the input is \"-1\", but the code is written to ignore the '-' and process the digits as 1. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. So the first part's result is either LCM (non-negative) or -1, but in the case of -1, the second program's input is \"-1\", which is invalid. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always non-negative. Therefore, in the C program, we can assume that the first part's result is non-negative, so we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, after computing res (the first part's result), we can proceed to process it through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and m as long long (since they can be up to 2^31-1).\n\nRead s and t as strings. In C, we can read them using fgets, but need to be careful with buffer sizes.\n\nThen compute GCD of n and m.\n\nThen check for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\nCompute pos_s = (k * n) / gcd.\n\npos_t = (k * m) / gcd.\n\nCheck if s[pos_s] == t[pos_t]. If any mismatch, set res to -1 and break.\n\nElse, compute LCM = (n * m) / gcd.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nWe need to process the res as a string. So first, convert res to a string. Since res can be up to (2^31-1)^2 / 1 \u2192 which is about 2^62, so we need to handle large numbers. But converting to a string can be done via sprintf.\n\nBut in C, to convert a long long to a string, we can use snprintf.\n\nThen, process the string through the second part's algorithm.\n\nThe second part's algorithm steps:\n\nThe input is the string of the res (e.g., \"1234\").\n\nWe need to process each digit from least significant to most, with the carry logic.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\n1. Convert the res to a string (number_str).\n\n2. Reverse the digits (since in the Java code, the digits are stored in reverse order, with digits[0] being the least significant digit).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array is filled as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo the digits array is the reversed digits of the input string. So the first digit in digits is the last character of the input string (the least significant digit).\n\nTherefore, in C, to replicate this, we can process the input string's characters in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, we can create an array of digits in reverse order.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\n- Convert res to a string (number_str).\n\n- Determine its length (len).\n\n- Create an array of digits of size len + 1 (to handle carries).\n\n- Initialize the digits array:\n\nfor (i from 0 to len-1):\n\n    digits[i] = number_str[len -1 -i] - '0';\n\ndigits[len] = 0; // since the array is size len+1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the digits array is initialized with length number.length() +1, so digits has length len+1. The loop runs for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). So the digits array has elements from 0 to len (since number.length() is len).\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\ndigits is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so size is len+1.\n\nThe loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 i goes up to len (since number.length() is len).\n\nTherefore, in C, the digits array should be of size len+1 (digits[0] to digits[len]).\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize digits array of size len+1.\n\nfor (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n    digits[i] = number_str[len -1 -i] - '0';\n\n}\n\ndigits[len] = 0; // since the loop in Java goes up to number.length() (i.e., len), so digits[len] is part of the array.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive) processes digits[i], so digits[len] is part of the array. So in C, digits is size len+1, with indices 0 to len.\n\nNow, process each digit:\n\nInitialize bills to 0.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to len (inclusive):\n\nWait, the Java code's loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is i from 0 to len (since number.length() is len).\n\nSo in C:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n\n    // process digits[i]\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    }\n\n    // but wait, in the Java code, the first step is to check if digits[i] is 10, then set to 0 and carry.\n\n    // but digits[i] can be 10 only if there was a carry from previous steps?\n\n    // So first, check if digits[i] is 10.\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n        if (i < len) { // because digits[i+1] must exist?\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // if i is len, then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. Wait, the array is size len+1, so digits[len] is the last element. So when i is len, digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. So this is a problem.\n\n            // Wait, in the Java code, the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so when i is number.length(), digits[i] is digits[len], and digits[i+1] would be digits[len+1], which is out of bounds. So perhaps in the Java code, the loop is up to number.length(), but the digits array is size len+1, so digits[len] is the last element. So when i is len, digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is beyond the array. Therefore, the Java code has an error here. Wait, no, the digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so the indices go up to number.length(). So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is digits[len], and digits[i+1] would be digits[len+1], which is out of bounds. So the Java code has a bug here. Wait, this is a problem. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe digits array is declared as:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\nso the indices are 0 to number.length() (since length is len, so indices 0..len).\n\nThe loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 i goes up to len (since number.length() is len).\n\nInside the loop:\n\ndigits[i+1] is accessed when i is len \u2192 i+1 is len+1, which is beyond the array's size (since the array is size len+1, indices 0..len). So this is an out of bounds error. Therefore, the Java code has a bug here. \n\nWait, this is a critical error. So the second Java program's code is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the code is written differently. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    }\n\n    if (digits[i] < 5) {\n\n        bills += digits[i];\n\n    } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n\n        if (digits[i + 1] >= 5) {\n\n            digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        }\n\n        bills += 5;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        bills += 10 - digits[i];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, when i is number.length() (i.e., the last index of the digits array), then digits[i+1] is digits[number.length() +1], which is out of bounds. So this is a bug. Therefore, the code must have a mistake. Perhaps the loop should be up to number.length() -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the digits array has length number.length() +1. So the indices are 0 to number.length(). So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element. Then, when we do digits[i+1], that would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. So this is an error. Therefore, the code has a bug. Therefore, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to number.length() -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits[i+1] is allowed to be beyond the array, but in Java, arrays are 0-based and the code would throw an exception. Therefore, the code is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to number.length() -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] is digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. So this is a bug. Therefore, the code is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to number.length() -1?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since the user provided the code, I have to assume that the code is correct. Perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct because when i is number.length(), the digits[i] is initialized to 0 (since the digits array is initialized with new int[...], which initializes to 0). So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is 0. Then, in the first condition:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10) \u2192 no.\n\nThen, the code proceeds to check if digits[i] <5 \u2192 yes (0 <5), so adds 0 to bills. Then, the rest of the code doesn't access digits[i+1] in this case. So the only time digits[i+1] is accessed is when digits[i] is 10, or when digits[i] is >=5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first part of the loop is:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\nElse, if digits[i] ==5 \u2192 then digits[i+1] is accessed (if the condition is met).\n\nElse (digits[i] >5) \u2192 digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\nSo when i is number.length() (the last index of the array), then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. So in those cases, when i is the last index and digits[i] is 10, 5, or >5, then accessing digits[i+1] would be out of bounds. Therefore, the code has a bug. \n\nThis is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to number.length() -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size number.length() +2, but the user's code has a mistake. Since I have to work with the given code, perhaps I should proceed assuming that the code is correct and there's a different way to handle it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches the last index (number.length()), the digits[i] is 0 (since initialized to 0), and the only time digits[i+1] is accessed is when digits[i] is 10, which can't happen because digits[i] is 0. So the code is safe.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe digits array is initialized with the digits of the input string, and the last element (digits[number.length()]) is initialized to 0 (since the array is initialized with new int[...], which sets all elements to 0).\n\nThen, during the loop:\n\nFor i from 0 to number.length():\n\n- For i < number.length():\n\n   digits[i] is set to the reversed digits of the input string.\n\n- digits[number.length()] is 0.\n\nNow, when processing i = number.length():\n\ndigits[i] is 0.\n\nSo the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is false.\n\nThen, the code checks if digits[i] <5 \u2192 yes, so adds 0 to bills.\n\nNo other conditions are met, so no access to digits[i+1].\n\nTherefore, the code is safe. Because the only time digits[i+1] is accessed is when digits[i] is 10, 5 (with the condition), or >5. But when i is the last index (number.length()), digits[i] is 0, so those conditions won't be met. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the loop is safe.\n\nTherefore, in C, the digits array must be of size len+1 (where len is the length of the input string). The loop runs from i=0 to len (inclusive).\n\nNow, in C, the steps for the second part:\n\nAfter converting res to a string (number_str), we need to process it.\n\nFirst, get the length of the string (len = strlen(number_str)).\n\nThen, create an array of digits of size len+1 (digits[0..len]).\n\nInitialize digits[0..len-1] as the reversed digits of the input string.\n\ndigits[len] = 0.\n\nThen, loop over i from 0 to len (inclusive):\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= len; i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    // but wait, in the Java code, the code is:\n\n    // digits[i+1]++ is done before setting digits[i] to 0?\n\n    Wait, in the Java code:\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    }\n\n    So first increment digits[i+1], then set digits[i] to 0.\n\n    So in C:\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    }\n\n    Then, proceed to the other conditions.\n\n    Then, after that, check the digit's value.\n\n    So the code proceeds as:\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) {\n\n        bills += digits[i];\n\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n        }\n\n        bills +=5;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        bills += 10 - digits[i];\n\n    }\n\n    But in the case where i is len (the last index), then digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is out of bounds. But in the first part of the loop (the if (digits[i] ==10) case), when i is len, digits[i] is 0 (since initialized to 0), so that condition won't be met. \n\n    For the other conditions:\n\n    When i is len:\n\n    digits[i] is 0 (initially), but after processing previous steps, it could have been modified?\n\n    Let's see:\n\n    Suppose during processing, when i is len-1, digits[i] could be 10, so digits[i+1] (which is digits[len]) is incremented. So digits[len] could be 1 or more.\n\n    Then, when i is len, digits[i] could be 1, which is less than 5, so added to bills. No problem.\n\n    But if digits[i] (digits[len]) is 10, then the first condition would trigger, but digits[i+1] is digits[len+1], which is out of bounds. But digits[len] can only be set to 10 if digits[i] (digits[len]) was 10, but how?\n\n    Let's see:\n\n    The only way digits[len] can be 10 is if in a previous iteration, when i was len-1, digits[i] was 10, so digits[i+1] (digits[len]) is incremented. But digits[i] (digits[len-1]) was 10, so after processing, digits[len-1] becomes 0, and digits[len] is increased by 1. So digits[len] can be up to 1 (if digits[len-1] was 10, then digits[len] increases by 1).\n\n    So digits[len] can't be 10. Therefore, the first condition (digits[i] ==10) when i is len won't be triggered.\n\n    Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n    So in C, the digits array is of size len+1, and the loop is safe.\n\n    Now, implementing this in C:\n\n    So the steps are:\n\n    After computing res (the first part's result):\n\n    if (res == -1) {\n\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n        // proceed to second part.\n\n    }\n\n    But according to the problem's setup, the second program must be run even if the first outputs -1. But in that case, the second program would crash. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative. So in the C code, we can assume that res is non-negative.\n\n    So proceed to convert res to a string.\n\n    To convert res to a string in C:\n\n    We can use snprintf. Since res can be up to (2^31-1)^2 / 1 \u2192 which is about 2^62, which is a 19-digit number. So we can allocate a buffer of 20 characters (plus sign if needed).\n\n    But since res is non-negative (assuming), we can do:\n\n    char number_str[25]; // enough for 20 digits plus null.\n\n    snprintf(number_str, sizeof(number_str), \"%lld\", res);\n\n    Then, process this string.\n\n    Now, the second part's processing:\n\n    len = strlen(number_str);\n\n    int digits[len+1]; // but in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99.\n\n    digits is an array of size len+1.\n\n    Initialize digits[0..len] to 0.\n\n    Then, for (int i=0; i < len; i++) {\n\n        digits[i] = number_str[len-1 -i] - '0';\n\n    }\n\n    digits[len] = 0;\n\n    Then, loop over i from 0 to len:\n\n    int bills =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <= len; i++) {\n\n        if (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n            digits[i] =0;\n\n        }\n\n        if (digits[i] <5) {\n\n            bills += digits[i];\n\n        } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n            if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n                digits[i+1]++;\n\n            }\n\n            bills +=5;\n\n        } else {\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n            bills +=10 - digits[i];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    Then, print bills.\n\n    Now, putting it all together.\n\n    Now, the first part's code:\n\n    Read n and m:\n\n    long long n, m;\n\n    scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &n, &m);\n\n    Read s and t:\n\n    char s[100000], t[100000]; // assuming the strings are not too long.\n\n    scanf(\"%s %s\", s, t);\n\n    Compute GCD:\n\n    int gcd = compute_gcd(n, m);\n\n    Then, check for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\n    int flag =1;\n\n    for (int k=0; k < gcd; k++) {\n\n        int pos_s = (k * n)/gcd;\n\n        int pos_t = (k * m)/gcd;\n\n        if (s[pos_s] != t[pos_t]) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (flag ==0) {\n\n        res =-1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        res = (n * m)/gcd;\n\n    }\n\n    Now, the GCD function:\n\n    int compute_gcd(int a, int b) {\n\n        while (b !=0) {\n\n            int temp = b;\n\n            b = a %b;\n\n            a = temp;\n\n        }\n\n        return a;\n\n    }\n\n    Wait, but n and m are long long. So the GCD function should handle long long.\n\n    So:\n\n    long long compute_gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n\n        while (b !=0) {\n\n            long long temp = b;\n\n            b = a %b;\n\n            a = temp;\n\n        }\n\n        return a;\n\n    }\n\n    So the GCD is computed as a long long.\n\n    Then, the positions:\n\n    pos_s = (k * n)/gcd_val;\n\n    pos_t = (k * m)/gcd_val;\n\n    where gcd_val is the GCD.\n\n    So in code:\n\n    long long gcd_val = compute_gcd(n, m);\n\n    int flag =1;\n\n    for (int k=0; k < gcd_val; k++) {\n\n        long long pos_s = (k * n)/gcd_val;\n\n        long long pos_t = (k * m)/gcd_val;\n\n        if (s[pos_s] != t[pos_t]) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (flag ==0) {\n\n        res =-1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        res = (n * m)/gcd_val;\n\n    }\n\n    Now, the problem is that n and m are long long, so their product could be very large. But since we divide by gcd_val, which is the GCD, the result is the LCM, which is (n*m)/gcd_val. Since n and m are up to 2^31-1, their product is up to 2^62, which fits in a long long (which is 64 bits).\n\n    So the code for the first part is okay.\n\n    Now, putting all together.\n\n    Now, the full C code:\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n\n    long long compute_gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n        while (b != 0) {\n            long long temp = b;\n            b = a % b;\n            a = temp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n        long long n, m;\n        char s[100000], t[100000];\n        scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &n, &m);\n        scanf(\"%s %s\", s, t);\n\n        long long gcd_val = compute_gcd(n, m);\n        int flag = 1;\n        for (int k = 0; k < gcd_val; k++) {\n            long long pos_s = (k * n) / gcd_val;\n            long long pos_t = (k * m) / gcd_val;\n            if (s[pos_s] != t[pos_t]) {\n                flag = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        long long res;\n        if (!flag) {\n            res = -1;\n        } else {\n            res = (n * m) / gcd_val;\n        }\n\n        // Now process the second part\n        if (res == -1) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // Convert res to string\n        char number_str[25];\n        snprintf(number_str, sizeof(number_str), \"%lld\", res);\n        int len = strlen(number_str);\n\n        // Process the second part's logic\n        int digits[len + 1];\n        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n            digits[i] = 0;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            digits[i] = number_str[len - 1 - i] - '0';\n        }\n\n        int bills = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n\n            if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                if (digits[i + 1] >= 5) {\n                    digits[i + 1]++;\n                }\n                bills += 5;\n            } else {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                bills += 10 - digits[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", bills);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    Now, checking for possible issues:\n\n    1. The strings s and t are read with scanf(\"%s %s\", s, t). But if the strings are too long (exceeding 100000), this will overflow. But assuming the problem constraints are within that limit.\n\n    2. The GCD function works for large numbers.\n\n    3. The positions pos_s and pos_t must be within the string lengths. Since the problem's first Java program reads s and t, and the code checks their characters at those positions, the input must ensure that the strings are long enough. The C code assumes that the input is correct.\n\n    4. The second part's processing of the digits array:\n\n    The digits array is initialized to 0 for all elements. Then, the first len elements are set to the reversed digits of the input string. The last element (digits[len]) is initialized to 0.\n\n    The loop for i from 0 to len (inclusive) processes each digit.\n\n    The code for the second part should be correct.\n\n    Now, testing edge cases:\n\n    Test case where first program outputs -1:\n\n    Input: 2 2 a b\n\n    The GCD is 2. Check k=0: positions 0 and 0 \u2192 a[0] vs b[0]. If they are different, then flag is 0 \u2192 res is -1. The program outputs -1.\n\n    Test case where first program outputs LCM:\n\n    Input: 2 3 a a a a a (s is \"aaaaa\", t is \"aaaaa\")\n\n    GCD is 1. Check k=0: positions 0 and 0 \u2192 same. So LCM is 6. The second part processes \"6\" \u2192 the digits array is [6, 0]. \n\n    Processing:\n\n    digits[0] =6.\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 6>5 \u2192 digits[1] becomes 1, bills +=4 (10-6=4).\n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total bills 5.\n\n    So output is 5.\n\n    Let me see what the second Java program would do for input \"6\".\n\n    The digits array would be [6,0].\n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 6>5 \u2192 digits[1] becomes 1, bills +=4.\n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 5.\n\n    So correct.\n\n    Another test case where first program outputs LCM 12.\n\n    The second program's input is \"12\".\n\n    digits array after reversing: digits[0] =2, digits[1]=1, digits[2]=0.\n\n    Processing:\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 2 <5 \u2192 add 2 \u2192 bills=2.\n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=3.\n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total 3.\n\n    So output is 3.\n\n    Let me see what the second Java program would do for input \"12\".\n\n    The digits array is [2,1,0].\n\n    i=0:\n\n    digits[0] is 2 \u2192 add 2 \u2192 bills=2.\n\n    i=1:\n\n    digits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=3.\n\n    i=2:\n\n    digits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total 3.\n\n    Correct.\n\n    So the code should be correct."
