But sqrt_x is a double. So when i is exactly equal to sqrt_x, like when x is a perfect square, like 25. Let's see:\n\nx=25. The code would check if it's a prime.\n\nsqrt(25)=5.0. The for loop starts at i=3, then 5. Check i=3: 25%3 is 1 \u2192 no. Then i=5. 5 <=5 \u2192 check 25%5 ==0 \u2192 yes. So break. Then i is 5. The condition (i>5.0) is false (5 is not greater than 5). So x +=2 \u2192 27.\n\nThen check 27. sqrt(27) is ~5.196. The loop runs from 3 to 5.196. So i=3,5.\n\nCheck 27 mod3 \u2192 0 \u2192 break. So i=3. Then 3>5.196? No. So x becomes 29. Check 29: sqrt is ~5.385. The loop runs i=3,5.\n\n29 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no. 29 mod5 is 4 \u2192 no. So i reaches 7 (since after 5, next is 7, which is >5.385). So i=7. Then 7>5.385 \u2192 yes. So break loop. So x is 29, which is correct (since 25 is not prime, 27 is not, 29 is prime). So the code works here. Another case where x is a square of a prime, like 9 (3 squared). The code correctly skips 9 and goes to 11. Thus, the code seems correct. Now, the only thing left is to make sure that the code uses the correct headers and functions. In C, the round function is in math.h, and requires linking with -lm. The code should include math.h. The code uses sqrt, which is also in math.h. So the final code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\n    if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) {\n        x++;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        double sqrt_x = sqrt(x);\n        int i;\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrt_x; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        } if (i > sqrt_x) {\n            break;\n        }\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    double input = x;\n    double countOdd = round(input / 2.0);\n    double ratio = countOdd / input;\n\n    printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ratio);\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in the first part's loop, when x is 2, the code works correctly. Let me test x=2 again. x=2: The condition (x !=2 \u2192 false, so no change. Then the loop:\n\nsqrt_x is sqrt(2) ~1.414. The for loop starts at i=3, which is >1.414 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So i remains 3. Then 3>1.414 \u2192 yes, so break. So x is 2. Correct. Another test case: x=1. As before, the code outputs 1, which is wrong but matches the original code's behavior. Now, the second part's calculation. Let me see when x is even. Suppose x is 4 \u2192 becomes 5 (prime). Then input is 5.0. countOdd is 3.0. 3/5 =0.6 \u2192 correct. Another case: x=6 \u2192 becomes 7. 7/2=3.5 \u2192 rounded to 4. 4/7 \u22480.5714285714. The code's printf with 10 decimals should handle that. Thus, the code should be correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Java file does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an integer input x from the user. Then it checks if x is even and not 2, and if so, increments it to the next odd number. Then it enters a loop to find the next prime number starting from that x. The loop checks if x is prime by testing divisors up to sqrt(x). If it's not a prime, it adds 2 and checks again. Once a prime is found, it prints x.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC142_A) takes a double input, calculates the number of odd integers up to that input (by rounding input/2), then computes the ratio of that count to the input, and prints it with 10 decimal places.\n\nThe key is to chain these two processes in C. The first program's output (the prime x) is the input to the second. So the C program must first compute the prime, then use that prime as the input to the second part's calculation.\n\nIn C, I need to read the input from stdin, process it through the first algorithm to get the prime, then process that prime through the second algorithm to compute the ratio, and finally print the result.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part in C. The first Java program's logic:\n\n- Read x from input.\n- If x is even and not 2, set x to x+1 (so it's odd).\n- Then loop: check if x is prime. To check, iterate from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2. If any divisor found, break and increment x by 2 (since we're only checking odd numbers). When no divisors found, break loop and output x.\n\nIn C, for the prime check, I need to compute sqrt(x). Since x can be up to... well, the problem's constraints aren't given, but in C, using sqrt from math.h. Also, since x can be large, but in the first problem, the code is for ABC149 C, which probably has x up to 1e18? Wait, but in Java, the code uses int, so x is up to 2^31-1. Wait, the first Java code uses int x, so x is 32-bit. So in C, we can use int for x, but need to make sure that when we compute sqrt, it's okay. Wait, but in the code, the loop is up to sqrt(x). So for x up to 2^31-1, sqrt(x) is up to about 46340, so even with int, that's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop starts at i=3 and increments by 2. So for even numbers, it's already handled by starting at 3 and stepping by 2. So the code is checking for factors up to sqrt(x). So in C, the same logic can be implemented.\n\nNow, the second part: taking the prime x (which is an integer) and using it as the input to the second program. The second Java program takes a double input, which in this case is the prime x (so an integer, but treated as a double). The second program calculates countOdd = rounded(input / 2). Since input is an integer (the prime x), input/2 would be a double. Rounding it to the nearest integer. For example, if x is 5, input/2 is 2.5, rounded to 3. So countOdd is 3. Then the ratio is countOdd / input, which is 3/5 = 0.6, but with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, the second Java code uses Math.round(input / 2). Since input is a double, input/2 is a double, and Math.round returns a long. So countOdd is a double here? Wait, in the code, countOdd is declared as a double, but the code does:\n\ndouble countOdd = Math.round(input / 2);\n\nWait, Math.round(double) returns a long, so casting to double? Or maybe in Java, the assignment is allowed. Anyway, in C, I need to compute the rounded value of x/2. Since x is an integer (the prime from first part), then x/2 is a double. Rounding to nearest integer. So for even x, it's exactly x/2. For odd x, it's (x+1)/2.\n\nWait, for example, if x is 5 (odd), then 5/2 is 2.5, rounded to 3. So countOdd is 3. The ratio is 3/5 = 0.6, but with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\n1. Read integer x from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the next prime as per first Java code.\n\n3. Take that prime (as a double) and compute countOdd = rounded(prime / 2).\n\n4. Compute the ratio countOdd / prime, and print it with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, translating the first part into C:\n\nFirst, read x from stdin. So:\n\nint x;\nscanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\nThen, check if x is even and not 2. If so, increment to x+1 (to make it odd). Wait, the code in Java does:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n\nWait, so if x is even and not 2, then x becomes x+1 (so odd). For example, if x is 4, then x becomes 5. Then the loop starts.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    int i;\n    double sqrtNum = sqrt(x);\n    for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n        if (x % i == 0) break;\n    }\n    if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n    x += 2;\n}\n\nHmm. Let's see. The loop continues until a prime is found. The for loop checks divisors from 3 upwards, stepping by 2 (so only odd numbers). If any divisor is found (i.e., x mod i is 0), then break the for loop, and then check if i is beyond sqrt(x). If so, then it's a prime. Else, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the condition after the for loop is: if (i > sqrtNum) break; else, continue.\n\nWait, the for loop runs from 3 to sqrt(x), stepping by 2. The loop breaks if a divisor is found. So after the loop, if i is greater than sqrt(x), that means the loop ran all the way to sqrt(x) without finding a divisor, so x is prime. So then break the while loop. Else, we need to increment x by 2 and try again.\n\nSo in C, the code would be similar. But in C, sqrt returns a double, so we can cast to int for the loop.\n\nWait, in the for loop, the condition is i <= sqrtNum. So in C, perhaps:\n\nsqrtNum = sqrt(x); // but need to include math.h\n\nThen, for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2 )\n\nBut in C, variables can be declared inside for loops (if using C99 or later). But to be safe, perhaps declare i before.\n\nWait, in C, the code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\n    if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) {\n        x++;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        double sqrt_x = sqrt(x);\n        int i;\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrt_x; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (i > sqrt_x) {\n            break;\n        }\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    // Now process the second part with x as the prime.\n\n    // ... code for second part here ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, the code may have an issue with sqrt returning a value that's slightly less than the actual square root due to floating point precision. For example, if x is a perfect square, like 25, sqrt(25) is exactly 5.0, so the loop will check up to 5. But if x is 26, sqrt(26) is about 5.099, so the loop will check up to 5 (since 5.099 is less than 5.1, but when i is 5, then 5.099 is greater than 5, so i will go up to 5. So that's okay.\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to cast sqrt_x to an integer, but maybe not necessary. Let's see.\n\nNow, moving to the second part. The second Java program takes a double input (which in this case is the prime x, so an integer). The code does:\n\ncountOdd = Math.round(input / 2);\n\nThen, the ratio is countOdd / input, and printed with 10 decimal places.\n\nIn C, how to do this?\n\nFirst, the input here is the prime x (integer). So input is (double)x.\n\ncountOdd is the rounded value of (x / 2.0). Since x is an integer, x/2.0 is a double. Rounding to nearest integer.\n\nIn C, to compute the rounded value, we can use the round function from math.h. So:\n\ndouble input = x; // since x is the prime, which is an integer.\n\ndouble countOdd = round(input / 2.0);\n\nThen, the ratio is countOdd / input.\n\nBut in C, to print with 10 decimal places, we can use printf with \"%.10f\".\n\nWait, but the second Java code uses BigDecimal and sets the scale to 10 with HALF_UP rounding. The round function in C uses round half away from zero, which is the same as HALF_UP for positive numbers. So that's okay.\n\nWait, the Java code uses Math.round, which rounds to the nearest integer, with 0.5 rounded up. The C round function does the same. So that's compatible.\n\nSo the code for the second part would be:\n\ndouble input = x;\ndouble countOdd = round(input / 2.0);\ndouble ratio = countOdd / input;\n\nprintf(\"%.10f\\n\", ratio);\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses BigDecimal to handle precise decimal arithmetic. However, in C, using floating points may have precision issues. But given that the problem's second part is to compute countOdd / input, where countOdd is an integer (rounded value), and input is an integer (the prime), the ratio is a rational number. However, when printed to 10 decimal places, using C's printf with \"%.10f\" should be sufficient, as long as the calculation is precise enough.\n\nWait, let's test with an example. Suppose x is 5 (prime). Then input is 5.0. countOdd is 3.0. ratio is 0.6. So 0.6000000000 would be printed. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: x=3. input is 3.0. countOdd is 2 (since 3/2=1.5 rounded to 2). ratio is 2/3 \u2248 0.6666666667.\n\nAnother example: x=2. Then input is 2.0. countOdd is 1.0. ratio is 0.5, so 0.5000000000.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when x is 2, the code in the first Java program would not increment it (since x is 2, so the condition x !=2 is false). Then the loop checks if 2 is prime. The loop would set sqrt_x to sqrt(2) ~1.414. The for loop starts at 3, which is greater than 1.414, so the loop doesn't run. Then i is 3, which is greater than sqrt_x (1.414), so break the while loop. So x remains 2. So the second part would process 2.0, which is okay.\n\nAnother test case: x=1. Wait, but the first program's input is an integer. Let's see. Suppose input is 1. Then in the first part:\n\nx is 1. Since it's not 2 and even? 1 is odd, so the condition (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) is false. So x remains 1. Then the loop starts.\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1, so the loop doesn't run. Then i is 3, which is greater than sqrt_x (1), so break the loop. So x is 1. But 1 is not a prime. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the first Java code's logic may have a bug here. Because 1 is not a prime, but according to the code, it would accept it as a prime?\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java code:\n\nThe code starts with x = input. Suppose input is 1.\n\nThen, since x is 1, which is not 2 and is odd (so the condition (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) is false, so x remains 1.\n\nThen the loop runs:\n\nsqrtNum = sqrt(1) = 1.0.\n\nThe for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1.0, so the loop doesn't execute. So i remains 3.\n\nThen, the condition if (i > sqrtNum) is true (3>1), so break the while loop. So x is 1, which is not a prime. So the code would output 1, which is incorrect.\n\nAh, so the first Java code has a bug here. Because 1 is not a prime, but the code would output it. So the code is incorrect for x=1.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the input is at least 2? Or maybe the code is intended for a specific problem where x is given such that it's okay. Well, since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if it has bugs. So in the C code, I have to replicate the same behavior, including the bug.\n\nSo in the case of x=1, the code would output 1, which is wrong, but that's what the original code does.\n\nSo proceeding with that.\n\nNow, back to the C code.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will read the input, process it through the first algorithm to get the prime (even with the bug for x=1), then compute the ratio as per the second Java code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, include necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <stdlib.h> // for round?\n\nWait, in C, the round function is in math.h, but need to make sure to link with -lm.\n\nWait, the code for the second part uses round, which is in math.h. So yes.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\n    // First part processing to get the prime x.\n\n    if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) {\n        x++;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        double sqrt_x = sqrt(x);\n        int i;\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrt_x; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (i > sqrt_x) {\n            break;\n        }\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    // Now compute the second part.\n\n    double input = x;\n    double countOdd = round(input / 2.0);\n    double ratio = countOdd / input;\n\n    // Print with 10 decimal places.\n\n    printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ratio);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, when x is 2, the code works correctly. Let's test with x=2:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nx is 2. The condition (x !=2 && even) is false, so x remains 2.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nsqrt(2) is ~1.414. The for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than 1.414, so the loop doesn't run. i is 3, which is > sqrt_x (1.414), so break the while loop. So x is 2, which is correct (prime).\n\nThen the second part: input is 2.0. countOdd is round(1.0) =1.0. ratio is 0.5, so printed as 0.5000000000.\n\nAnother test case: input is 3.\n\nFirst part: x starts as 3. Since it's odd and not 2, no change. Then check sqrt(3) ~1.732. The loop starts at 3, which is larger than 1.732, so loop doesn't run. So x remains 3. Correct.\n\nSecond part: 3/2 =1.5 \u2192 rounded to 2. 2/3 is 0.6666666667.\n\nAnother test case: input is 4.\n\nFirst part: x is 4. Not 2 and even \u2192 x becomes 5.\n\nCheck if 5 is prime. sqrt(5) ~2.236. The loop starts at 3, which is larger than 2.236 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So x is 5. Correct.\n\nSecond part: 5/2=2.5 \u2192 rounded to 3. 3/5=0.6 \u2192 0.6000000000.\n\nAnother test case: input is 6.\n\nFirst part: x is 6. Not 2 and even \u2192 x becomes 7.\n\nCheck 7: sqrt(7) ~2.645. The loop starts at 3, which is larger than 2.645 \u2192 so x is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond part: 7/2=3.5 \u2192 rounded to 4. 4/7 \u22480.5714285714.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the input is 1?\n\nFirst part: x=1. The condition (x !=2 && even) is false (since 1 is odd). Then the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The for loop starts at 3, which is >1 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So x remains 1. Which is not a prime, but the code outputs it. So the code has the same bug as the original Java code.\n\nBut since the user wants to replicate the original code's behavior, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code in C should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, when x is 9 (which is not a prime):\n\nLet's see. Suppose input is 9.\n\nFirst part:\n\nx starts as 9 (odd). The code checks if it's prime.\n\nsqrt(9) is 3. So the loop runs from i=3 to 3 (since 3 <=3). Check 9%3 ==0 \u2192 yes. So break the for loop. Then i is 3, which is not greater than sqrt_x (3). So the condition (i>sqrt_x) is false (3>3 is false). So x +=2 \u2192 becomes 11.\n\nNow check 11. sqrt(11) is ~3.316. The loop starts at i=3. 3 <=3.316 \u2192 check 11%3 \u2192 11 mod3 is 2 \u2192 not 0. So loop continues to i=5? Wait, no. Wait, after the first iteration (i=3), since 11%3 is not 0, the loop increments i by 2 to 5. But 5 is greater than sqrt(11) (3.316), so the loop stops. So i is 5. Then check if i>sqrt_x (3.316). 5>3.316 \u2192 yes. So break the while loop. So x is 11, which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nAnother edge case: x=2. The code works as expected.\n\nNow, the code in C should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, after the for loop, the code checks if (i > sqrt_x). But sqrt_x is a double. So when i is exactly equal to sqrt_x, like when x is a perfect square, like 25. Let's see:\n\nx=25. The code would check if it's a prime.\n\nsqrt(25)=5.0. The for loop starts at i=3, then 5.\n\nCheck i=3: 25%3 is 1 \u2192 no. Then i=5. 5 <=5 \u2192 check 25%5 ==0 \u2192 yes. So break. Then i is 5. The condition (i>5.0) is false (5 is not greater than 5). So x +=2 \u2192 27.\n\nThen check 27. sqrt(27) is ~5.196. The loop runs from 3 to 5.196. So i=3,5.\n\nCheck 27 mod3 \u2192 0 \u2192 break. So i=3. Then 3>5.196? No. So x becomes 29.\n\nCheck 29: sqrt is ~5.385. The loop runs i=3,5.\n\n29 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no. 29 mod5 is 4 \u2192 no. So i reaches 7 (since after 5, next is 7, which is >5.385). So i=7. Then 7>5.385 \u2192 yes. So break loop. So x is 29, which is correct (since 25 is not prime, 27 is not, 29 is prime).\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nAnother case where x is a square of a prime, like 9 (3 squared). The code correctly skips 9 and goes to 11.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to make sure that the code uses the correct headers and functions.\n\nIn C, the round function is in math.h, and requires linking with -lm. The code should include math.h.\n\nThe code uses sqrt, which is also in math.h.\n\nSo the final code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\n    if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) {\n        x++;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        double sqrt_x = sqrt(x);\n        int i;\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrt_x; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (i > sqrt_x) {\n            break;\n        }\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    double input = x;\n    double countOdd = round(input / 2.0);\n    double ratio = countOdd / input;\n\n    printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ratio);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, when x is 2, the code works correctly. Let me test x=2 again.\n\nx=2:\n\nThe condition (x !=2 \u2192 false, so no change. Then the loop:\n\nsqrt_x is sqrt(2) ~1.414. The for loop starts at i=3, which is >1.414 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So i remains 3. Then 3>1.414 \u2192 yes, so break. So x is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=1.\n\nAs before, the code outputs 1, which is wrong but matches the original code's behavior.\n\nNow, the second part's calculation. Let me see when x is even.\n\nSuppose x is 4 \u2192 becomes 5 (prime). Then input is 5.0. countOdd is 3.0. 3/5 =0.6 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: x=6 \u2192 becomes 7. 7/2=3.5 \u2192 rounded to 4. 4/7 \u22480.5714285714.\n\nThe code's printf with 10 decimals should handle that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
