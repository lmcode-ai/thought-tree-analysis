So code steps:\n\nRead x,a,y.\n\nCheck if any of them is 5 or 7: perhaps:\n\nint hasFiveOrSeven = 0;\nif (x ==5 || x ==7 || a==5 || a ==7 || y==5 || y==7) {\n    hasFiveOrSeven =1;\n}\nThen check if sum is 17, and hasFiveOrSeven is 1.

What about x, a, y all 5: 5+5+7 =17? 17? 5+5+7 is 17? 17. Yes, but here sum is 17 and has 5 and 7, so yes. Wait, the code is correct, I think.
