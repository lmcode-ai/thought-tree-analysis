Read n elements:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n}\n\nThen, proceed with the logic. Looking at variable declarations:\n\nInitialize result, pos, flag:\n\nint result, pos = 0, flag =0. Wait, in C, need to set them when initialized. Or declare each line. Alternatively:\n\nint pos =0, flag=0;\n\nThen for result, it can be declared after some conditions. Now, the first condition:\n\nif (a[0] >15) {\n\n    result =15;\n\n} else {\n\n    then loop through i from 1 to (n-1):\n\n    for (int i=1; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if (a[i] - a[i-1] >15) {\n\n           pos = i-1;\n\n           flag =1;\n\n           break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    then check flag. if (flag) result =a[pos]+15;\n\n    else result =a[n-1] +15;\n\n}\n\nAfter that, check if result exceeds 90:\n\nif (result >90) {\n\n    result =90;\n\n} Then, print it via printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- n is 1. In the first case, since it can't enter the else part's loop, so after checking a[0], then if first element <=15, the loop runs for i=1 to n-1, but n is 1, so loop doesn't run. So flag remains 0. Then result is a[0]+15 (since a[0] <=15, so a[0]+15 can be up to 30, which is under 90). Another case when n=0? Probably the problem ensures n is at least 1, given the Java code uses a.get(0), so perhaps n >=1. Now, edge case when a has elements with differences all <=15 except the first element greater than 15. So set result to 15, then check if 15>90? No, so correct. Another edge case when adding 15 to a[pos] makes it over 90. So in that case, it gets capped. Now, putting it all together in C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int a[n]; // variable length array\n\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    int result, pos=0, flag=0; if (a[0] >15) {\n        result =15;\n    } else {\n        for (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] - a[i-1] >15) {\n                pos = i-1;\n                flag=1;\n                break;\n            }\n        } if (flag ==1) {\n            result = a[pos] +15;\n        } else {\n            result = a[n-1] +15;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (result>90) {\n        result=90;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but in C, you have to make sure that the array is properly read.

Let me start by understanding what the code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads n integers into an ArrayList. Then it checks if the first element is greater than 15. If so, the result is set to 15. Otherwise, it loops through the array to check if any consecutive elements have a difference greater than 15. If found, it records the position and sets a flag. Based on the flag, it calculates the result as the value at that position plus 15. If no such pair is found, the result is the last element plus 15. Finally, if the result exceeds 90, it's capped at 90.\n\nNow, translating this into C. Since Java uses an ArrayList, but C uses arrays. So first, I need to read n elements into an array. \n\nIn C, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read n integers into an array.\n3. Process the array as per the conditions.\n\nLet me see the variables needed. The Java variables are:\n\n- n: integer read from input.\n- a: array list (in C, an array of integers).\n- value: temporary variable for reading each element.\n- result, pos, flag: integers for calculations.\n\nIn C:\n\n- Use standard input functions like scanf and arrays. Need to read n first, then allocate an array of size n. The Java code uses dynamic list via ArrayList, but since in C arrays are fixed size, but since n is known first, just make an array of size n.\n\nWait, but in C, the size of an array must be known at compile time unless we use dynamic memory. Since n is a variable, the array will have to be allocated dynamically using malloc. So first read n, then allocate the array. But since in C99, variable-length arrays are allowed. Wait, whether the user wants C99 or not? Probably better to use malloc to be safe, or just use VLA.\n\nBut perhaps to keep it simple here, assuming that the n is manageable, so using a VLA might be okay.\n\nWait, code submission platforms might accept C99 with VLA. Alternatively, let me check the code structure.\n\nMoreover, for the ArrayList functions like get(i) in Java, in C, the array can be accessed directly.\n\nNow, the logic:\n\nThe first check: if the first element (a[0]) is greater than 15. If yes, result is 15. Else, loop through the array from index 1 to n-1, checking whether a[i] - a[i-1] is >15. If so, set pos to i-1 and set flag, break.\n\nThen, if flag is set, result is a[pos]+15. Else, the last element +15. Then, if result >90, cap it.\n\nIn C code structure:\n\nStart by including necessary headers: <stdio.h> for input and math if needed (though probably not here).\n\nRead n with scanf. Then declare an array of integers of size n.\n\nWait, code for reading input:\n\nint n;\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nThen, int a[n]. Read n elements:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n}\n\nThen, proceed with the logic.\n\nLooking at variable declarations:\n\nInitialize result, pos, flag:\n\nint result, pos = 0, flag =0.\n\nWait, in C, need to set them when initialized. Or declare each line.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nint pos =0, flag=0;\n\nThen for result, it can be declared after some conditions.\n\nNow, the first condition:\n\nif (a[0] >15) {\n\n    result =15;\n\n} else {\n\n    then loop through i from 1 to (n-1):\n\n    for (int i=1; i < n; i++) {\n\n        if (a[i] - a[i-1] >15) {\n\n           pos = i-1;\n\n           flag =1;\n\n           break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    then check flag.\n\n    if (flag) result =a[pos]+15;\n\n    else result =a[n-1] +15;\n\n}\n\nAfter that, check if result exceeds 90:\n\nif (result >90) {\n\n    result =90;\n\n}\n\nThen, print it via printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- n is 1. In the first case, since it can't enter the else part's loop, so after checking a[0], then if first element <=15, the loop runs for i=1 to n-1, but n is 1, so loop doesn't run. So flag remains 0. Then result is a[0]+15 (since a[0] <=15, so a[0]+15 can be up to 30, which is under 90).\n\nAnother case when n=0? Probably the problem ensures n is at least 1, given the Java code uses a.get(0), so perhaps n >=1.\n\nNow, edge case when a has elements with differences all <=15 except the first element greater than 15. So set result to 15, then check if 15>90? No, so correct.\n\nAnother edge case when adding 15 to a[pos] makes it over 90. So in that case, it gets capped.\n\nNow, putting it all together in C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int a[n]; // variable length array\n\n    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    int result, pos=0, flag=0;\n\n    if (a[0] >15) {\n        result =15;\n    } else {\n        for (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] - a[i-1] >15) {\n                pos = i-1;\n                flag=1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (flag ==1) {\n            result = a[pos] +15;\n        } else {\n            result = a[n-1] +15;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (result>90) {\n        result=90;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in C, you have to make sure that the array is properly read. Also, the code is straightforward.\n\nWait, variable declarations in C: the variables result, pos, flag must be declared before any possible use. So the initial declarations:\n\nint result, pos=0, flag=0; \n\nBut in the first case, when a[0]>15, then 'result' is assigned there. That's okay, because 'result' will be declared. But before the if-else, 'result' is uninitialized? Wait, no, in the code as written, in the first case, the code will initialize 'result', so when the if executes, it's okay.\n\nWait, in C, variables can be declared anywhere, but in this code:\n\nint result, pos=0, flag=0; declares all three. But, the variable 'result' would be uninitialized? Because variable definitions: order. The first time you declare a variable:\n\nint result, pos=0, flag=0;\n\nSo 'result' is declared but not initialized (so it has some garbage value). But in the if statement, we have to ensure that when the else block is not taken (the 'if (a[0] >15)') then 'result' gets a value. However, in the 'if' branch, the result is assigned 15. Otherwise in the else block, the 'result' is assigned correctly via the if-else inside the else. So the initialization of 'result' is okay.\n\nWait, but the code may compile but have issues if 'result' is not initialized, but in the code path, 'result' is always assigned a value before being used. Let me confirm:\n\nThe code is structured so that either way (if the first condition is met or not) result is defined. Because the if-else will set it in both branches. So it's okay.\n\nBut in C, a variable's value can be used before it is assigned in the code path. Wait, the code is such that in all possible execution paths, 'result' will be set before it's needed. So no undefined behavior.\n\nBut in the C code, the variable 'result' is declared, but not initialized. So the following code does that but in code paths, the variable is assigned before the 'if (result>90)'.\n\nTherefore, the code is okay.\n\nAlternative approach: Initialize 'result' with some initial value, e.g.,\n\n// after declarations:\n\nresult =0;\n\nBut in the code paths, it's assigned again.\n\nAlternatively, since the code does take care (the first if or the else path assign something to 'result'), so initial garbage isn't read.\n\nTherefore, code should be fine.\n\nSo that's the translation."
