So in that case, the C code should read the entire line but without the newline. So:\n\nRead the line with fgets, then set the '\\n' to '\\0' if it exists. Yes. Because that would get the exact string as the user entered before pressing Enter. So here's an outline:\n\nchar input[1024];\n\nfgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n\n// remove the trailing newline, if present\n\ninput[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\nOnce that's done, the rest is processing the characters. Now, the main code. Loop through each character. Wait, the array in C is char input [] which after input is stored is a null-terminated string. So the loop would be for (int i = 0; input[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) ... Processing each character as per the conditions. Now, the 's' is tracked as an integer (0 or 1). So:\n\nint s =0; Wait, look at the code again. The initial state is s = false (so s is 0). So yes. So, the loop would process each character. Wait, let me code this:\n\nint main() {\n\n    char input[1024];\n\n    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n\n    input[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;  // remove the newline\n\n    int s = 0; \n\n    int i;\n\n    for (i=0; input[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n\n        char c = input[i];\n\n        if (c == '.') {\n\n            if (s) {\n\n                printf(\"1\");\n\n                s =0;\n\n            } else {\n\n                printf(\"0\");\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            if (s) {\n\n                printf(\"2\");\n\n                s =0;\n\n            } else {\n\n                s =1;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, is that all?

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me see what's going on here first. The Java code reads a string input, then iterates over its characters. It's processing characters in a way where when it finds a '.', there might be some logic involving the 's' boolean flag. The output depends on that flag.\n\nHmm, the input is read via a Scanner in Java, so in C I'll need to get input from stdin. Maybe using scanf or gets? But since the input is a string, perhaps fgets would be better to avoid buffer overflow.\n\nThe main part is translating the logic of the loop over each character. Java's char array makes each character an ASCII value. In C, I can read the string into a character array and loop through each character.\n\nThe 's' variable is a boolean. In C, we can use an integer (0 or 1) to represent that instead.\n\nWait, let's look at the code again. The loop processes each character of the input (as a char array). When a '.' is encountered, if 's' was true, it prints '1' and sets 's' to false. Else, it prints '0'. If the character isn't '.', then when s is true, it prints '2' and sets s to false, else sets s to true.\n\nThe logic here probably is about the state transition of pairs or something? Maybe similar to binary states but with characters.\n\nSo in C, how to implement this:\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's allocate a character array, say max length 100 or so, using fgets. Wait, what is the maximum input length? The problem might not specify, but since the Java code's array's length is whatever the input gives. So in C, perhaps read a line, with a size that's a bit more.\n\nWait, but the code in Java uses next(), which reads the next token, so probably the user inputs a single string until a line, or maybe space-separated? But next() reads the next token, which is up to the next whitespace. So maybe in C, we can read a single word using scanf with %s, but safer with fgets and process the string up to the newline. Hmm, maybe better to use fgets with a string and save the string, then loop through each character until the NULL terminator, or until the newline?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using getchar(). But maybe the best way is to read the entire line with fgets, ignoring the newline, and then process each character.\n\nOnce the string is in a C char array, the loop is straightforward.\n\nThe 's' variable in Java is a boolean. In C, replace with a char or int s (like 0 and 1). Initialize s as 0 or false (0).\n\nInside the loop:\n\nfor each character:\n\nif current char is '.' (ASCII '.' is 46?), check s:\n\nif s is true (1), then output 1, set s to 0.\n\nElse (s is 0), output 0.\n\nElse (if character is not '.'), then:\n\nif s is 1, output 2, set s to 0.\n\nElse, set s to 1.\n\nWait no: \"else\" part (non '.') in the code:\n\nIn the Java code, when it's a non '.' character:\n\nif (s is true) { print 2 and set s to false }\n\nelse { set s to true }\n\nYes. So in C:\n\nfor each char c in the string:\n\n    if (c == '.') {\n\n            if (s) {\n\n                printf(\"1\");\n\n                s = 0;\n\n            } else {\n\n                printf(\"0\");\n\n            }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (s) {\n\n            printf(\"2\"); \n\n            s = 0;\n\n        } else {\n\n            s = 1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait, but non '.' can be anything else. But maybe it's just a certain character, but in Java's code, it just checks if it's '.' or not, so any other character is treated as else. So in the C code, the same logic applies.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, in C:\n\nInitialize s as 0 (false).\n\nRead the input string into a buffer.\n\nLoop through each character (until null? Or until the string's length). Using a loop like for (int i=0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) ... \n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nFirst, include necessary headers: <stdio.h> and <string.h> for fgets perhaps.\n\nThe code outline would be:\n\nint main() {\n\n   char input[1024]; // assuming enough buffer size.\n\n   fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n\n   int s = 0;\n\n   int i;\n\n   for (i=0; input[i] != '\\0' || input[i] != '\\n'; i++) {\n\n      Wait, but actually, fgets will include the newline if there's space. So in the loop, process each character until the '\\0'? But in C, string literals are null-terminated.\n\n      Wait, better:\n\n   for (i = 0; input[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n       char c = input[i];\n\n       if (c == '.') {\n\n           if (s) {\n\n               printf(\"1\");\n\n               s =0;\n\n           } else {\n\n               printf(\"0\");\n\n           }\n\n       } else {\n\n           if(s) {\n\n               printf(\"%d\", 2);\n\n               s =0;\n\n           } else {\n\n               s =1;\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nWait, but the code above for the else (non '.') case.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, what about the '$' at the end of the string? Hmm, no, because input is the string read by fgets, which includes '\\n' if present but not exceeding buffer, then null-terminated. So the loop will stop at the null.\n\nBut in Java, the .next() doesn't include newlines by default, but perhaps the input is simply taken as a single token until a whitespace, so maybe in C, using fgets with the whole line is okay, but perhaps in the problem, the input is given as a single token with no whitespace. But given the same code, it's better to read the entire input as is (even if including new line is okay, but the '.' is treated as a character, but the code in Java is using .next() so it omits any whitespace, maybe. Since the Java code uses next(), it reads the next token, which is the next sequence of non-whitespace characters. So perhaps in C, using a combination of getchar() until space or newline.\n\nHmm, maybe to make the input reading as similar as possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the input doesn't contain whtespace, so the input string is read with scanf until the end.\n\nAlternatively, using getchar() to read each character one by one:\n\nAnother way: maybe in C, we can read character by character until EOF, but since input is a single string, probably better to read the entire input except whitspace separator.\n\nHmm. To replicate Java's in.next() function which reads until next whitespace, we can use fgets with reading until any whitespace, but perhaps the maximum beep. Maybe better, in this case, since the original code uses next(), the input is a single word (as token). So in C, We can read it using scanf(\"%[^\\n]s\", buffer) but that's tricky. Maybe safer with fgets and then trimming the newline. Because fgets includes the newline character if it is read in time.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line including newline (if present), but then in the processing, ignore the newline? Or just process the string as per the input.\n\nAlternatively, read each character one by one until we hit a space or newline. Hmm, perhaps the first approach with fgets is better.\n\nWait, let's think of the exact problem.\n\nThe Java code uses Scanner's next(), so the input is a single token (without whitespace). The input will be parsed into a string. Then converted to a character array.\n\nSo, in C, to replicate the input, I can read the string until the first whitespace.\n\nTherefore, using fgets which reads until '\\n' or until the next whitespace?\n\nWait, the fgets function will read up to and including the newline if it can, but it is considered a single token. Wait, no, it will read until it finds a newline or NUL terminator (when buffer is full). Wait, no, when you call fgets, it reads a line, which is including the newline. But if the line is \"abc\" (without a newline), then when the input has \"abc <enter>\", then the input to fgets is \"abc\\n\".\n\nBut the code is expecting the entire token, including the '.' but not newline?\n\nWait, maybe in Java, the .next() reads \"abc...\" (the token), which does not include the newline, assuming the user input is entered as \"abc...\" followed by enter.\n\nSo, the newline is part of the Enter, but the next() only takes the tokens up until the whitespace. So in that case, the C code should read the entire line but without the newline. So:\n\nRead the line with fgets, then set the '\\n' to '\\0' if it exists.\n\nYes. Because that would get the exact string as the user entered before pressing Enter.\n\nSo here's an outline:\n\nchar input[1024];\n\nfgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n\n// remove the trailing newline, if present\n\ninput[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\nOnce that's done, the rest is processing the characters.\n\nNow, the main code.\n\nLoop through each character.\n\nWait, the array in C is char input[] which after input is stored is a null-terminated string. So the loop would be for (int i = 0; input[i] != '\\0'; i++) ... \n\nProcessing each character as per the conditions.\n\nNow, the 's' is tracked as an integer (0 or 1). So:\n\nint s =0;\n\nWait, look at the code again. The initial state is s = false (so s is 0). So yes.\n\nSo, the loop would process each character.\n\nWait, let me code this:\n\nint main() {\n\n    char input[1024];\n\n    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n\n    input[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;  // remove the newline\n\n    int s = 0; \n\n    int i;\n\n    for (i=0; input[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n        char c = input[i];\n\n        if (c == '.') {\n\n            if (s) {\n\n                printf(\"1\");\n\n                s =0;\n\n            } else {\n\n                printf(\"0\");\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            if (s) {\n\n                printf(\"2\");\n\n                s =0;\n\n            } else {\n\n                s =1;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, is that all?\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest when the input has all '.':\n\nLike the string \"....\" \n\nProcessing each character:\n\nStart s is 0.\n\nFirst '.' : since s is 0 \u2192 print '0'. s remains 0?\n\nWait wait, in code for '.', when s is false:\n\nFirst '.', print 0, s is still 0?\n\nYes, because the else block (s is false) doesn't touch s.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIf (c is '.' ), then if s was true, print 1 and turn s false.\n\nElse (s not true), just print '0', s remains the same (0).\n\nSo for the first '.' of \"....\", we have s is 0 \u2192 print 0, s stays 0.\n\nSecond '.' (still s=0 \u2192 print 0 again. And s remains 0. Output '00'.\n\nWait but I should test:\n\nSample input: \"abc...de\"\n\nWait let's see:\n\nLet me think of some test cases. Let's see the Java code.\n\nWait, maybe an example from the original problem?\n\nWait the problem is codeforces 32 B (link?), but since I can't look it up now, perhaps better to think of some scenarios.\n\nTake an input of 'a':\n\nThe first char is not a '.'.\n\nAt initial s is 0, so check the else block: s is false.\n\nSo the code goes into the else (char is not '.'): since s was 0 \u2192 set s =1. Nothing printed.\n\nSo no output from that.\n\nWait but the code only prints 2,1,0 in some cases. So for 'a', nothing is printed because it's a character, no? Wait, the 'a' isn't a '.' so we look at the else block. Since s is 0, we set s to 1, but there's no print statement except for the 'if' part inside the else? Wait:\n\nWait the code for else cases (non '.'): if (s is true)? then print 2 then turn s false, else set s to true.\n\nIn the case of the non '.' character where s is 0 (which it was at the start), so the 'else' clause in the else block:\n\nElse (original s was 0) \u2192 set s to 1. So nothing is printed here.\n\nOnly when s is true, when you get a non '.' character again, then you set s to 0 and print 2.\n\nHmm, maybe an example:\n\nSuppose input is 'a.b'\n\nFirst character 'a':\n\ns starts at 0 \u2192 so else (non '.' case) \u2192 since s is 0, set s =1 \u2192 nothing printed.\n\nSecond char '.' :\n\ns is 1 \u2192 yes, so print '1', set s to 0.\n\nThird char 'b':\n\n not '.' \u2192 check s is 0 \u2192 set s to 1 \u2192 no print.\n\nResult: So output is \"1\".\n\nAnother example: input 'ab' \u2192 then first 'a' sets s to 1, then 'b' again sets s to 1 \u2192 so no printing except nothing. The output would be empty.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to see if the java code's print statements actually print in those cases. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nLooking at the Java code: for non '.' chars, the code in the 'else' branch:\n\nif (s is true), then print 2 and set s to false. Else (s false \u2192 set s to true.)\n\nThus for the first 'a' in 'a.b', after processing:\n\nFirst character 'a' sets s to 1.\n\nSecond character '.' \u2192 s is true \u2192 print '1', s now 0.\n\nThird character 'b' \u2192 not '.' \u2192 s is 0 \u2192 go to 'else' in the else-clause (the outer else's block: when not '.'), so set s to 1, but since it was already false.\n\nYes, that's what in Java. The code in C reproduces this behavior.\n\nSo, the code above in C should be correct.\n\nWait but one thing: the C code's output concatenates the outputs. So when multiple prints happen. Like the sample code:\n\nSuppose input is \"01\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst character '0':\n\nnot '.', check s is 0 \u2192 set s to 1 \u2192 no print.\n\nsecond character '1': also not '.', so:\n\ns was 1 \u2192 then in the else block (not '.'), check if s is true \u2192 yes. So print '2', and set s to 0.\n\nThus the output is \"2\".\n\nAnother example.\n\nTest input \"....\" \u2192 first 4 '.'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst '.' \u2192 s is 0 \u2192 print \"0\", s remains 0.\n\nSecond '.' \u2192 s is still 0 \u2192 print \"0\", s still 0.\n\nThird '.' \u2192 again 0 \u2192 print \"0\", s 0.\n\nFourth '.' \u2192 same \u2192 \"0\". Thus total output is 0000.\n\nAnother case: \"abc\" \u2192 all non '.'.\n\nIteration 1: s=0 \u2192 set to 1 (no output)\n\nIteration2: c 'b', s is1 \u2192 so check the else of '.':\n\nsince s is true \u2192 print '2' and set to0.\n\nWait, wait no, let me step through:\n\nWait, first character is 'a':\n\ns is 0 \u2192 so set s to 1 (no print).\n\nSecond character 'b':\n\nnot '.' and s is now 1 \u2192 so in the else block (non '.'), check whether s is true \u2192 yes \u2192 print 2, s set to0.\n\nWait yes. So the second character 'b' will result in '2'.\n\nThird character 'c':\n\ncheck \u2192 s is 0 \u2192 so in non '.' and s false \u2192 set s to1 \u2192 no print.\n\nThus total output is '2'.\n\nSo, for \"abc\", output is 2.\n\nThat matches with code logic.\n\nSo C code seems correct.\n\nAh, wait, also in the code in C, the print statements for '0', '1', and '2' use printf. For 0 and 1, it might need a %c or %d?\n\nLooking at the Java code, System.out.print(0) which outputs a character '0'? No wait, no, Java's print(int) will output the integer as a character.\n\nWait wait, System.out prints the value as a number. So for 0, System.out.print(0) outputs '0' (the character), but wait no! Wait in Java, the code is:\n\nFor the case when '.' and s is true: print 1 as integer. So when printed, '1' is the character. Wait no! System.out.print(1) would print the digit '1', because it's an integer. Wait no: System.out.print(0) would output '0' as the string.\n\nWait in Java, printing an 'int' via print will output the integer's numeric value. For example:\n\nIf I do System.out.print(0) \u2192 it outputs \"0\".\n\nYes. So in Java, the code is treating those numbers as integers to print their digits.\n\nIn C, the code has to print the digit as a character.\n\nWait wait no: in the code I wrote for C, for the first case, for a '.' and s was true:\n\nprintf(\"1\"); \u2192 which outputs the string \"1\". So that's fine. But in the case when it's supposed to print the number as a character, that's okay. Because '1' as a character is the string '1', which is the same.\n\nWait, in the code sample for C I wrote above:\n\nprintf(\"1\"); \u2192 this is a string literal, so it will print character '1'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe should use printf(\"%d\", 1) to write the 1 as a digit. However, in this case, it's the same because the numbers 0,1,2 are single digits. So printing \"0\" as a string is okay. Or using printf(\"%d\", ...) might be more accurate.\n\nWait, the Java code does System.out.print(0), which would print \"0\".\n\nSimilarly, the C code's printf(\"0\") would also output a \"0\".\n\nBut in the code, perhaps better to use %d to output the integers, so the code becomes:\n\nWhen s is true in the '.' case:\n\nprintf(\"1\");\n\nBut if s is false \u2192 printf(\"0\");\n\nSame with when in the other else, printf(\"2\").\n\nAlternatively, the code can just concatenate the characters in strings or use numeric output.\n\nLooking back, in the sample code, the code would output the same in C as in Java.\n\nWait the Java code outputs those numbers as integers, so using System.out.print(1) in Java outputs \"1\".\n\nIn C, using printf(\"1\") does the same exact output. So the code should work.\n\nSo the code in C as written should match.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
