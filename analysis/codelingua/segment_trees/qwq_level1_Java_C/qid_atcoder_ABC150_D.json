If not, it then checks each element in a to see if (LCM divided by a[i]) is even; if any such division is even, it outputs 0 again. Finally, if all checks pass, it calculates (m divided by LCM + 1) divided by 2 and prints that. Hmm, translating to C. Let me think about the steps.

So if the problem's m exceeds that, the code would break. But since the problem is from AtCoder ABC 150 D probably, perhaps their constraints are such that m is <= something like 1e18. Wait, no, in the code they use 'long lcd =1', so the LCM can be up to 1e12... Hmm, perhaps there's inconsistency. It's better to use long long in C for m.\n\nThus, in the code, changing variable m to be 'long long':\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    long long m;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %lld\", &n, &m)!=2) {\n        // handle error but probably unnecessary here\n    }\n    ... rest as before...\n\nWait that way, m is read correctly as a long long, so even if it's a large value up to 1e18, it can be read. But then, when in the first for loop, a[i] are inputs which can be up to (some number such that a[i] = (input number)/2, and input number is up to m. Wait the original code takes x = next(), then a[i] = x/2. So even if input x is up to 2m (can't be larger than m?), probably input numbers must be less than 2*m. So to parse this correctly, the input numbers can be up to 2m. So if m is big, those numbers can be big, so need to read them as 64 bits? Wait, in the code where the input numbers are read as x in C:\n\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\nWait that would read the input as an int, which again may overflow if input x is larger than 2^31 or so.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the code reads two integers, n and m, then an array a of size n. Each element in a is the input value divided by 2. Then it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in a. If the LCM exceeds m, it outputs 0 and exits. If not, it then checks each element in a to see if (LCM divided by a[i]) is even; if any such division is even, it outputs 0 again. Finally, if all checks pass, it calculates (m divided by LCM + 1) divided by 2 and prints that.\n\nHmm, translating to C. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the structure of a C program is different. We'll need to use the main function, read inputs using scanf. But wait, in Java, they use a Scanner, which reads tokens. In C, maybe I need to read from stdin as per space-separated inputs.\n\nThe classes and objects in Java don't translate here. The code is in a class atcoder_ABC150_D with a main method. In C, the program starts with main(), which can be int main().\n\nLet me note the variables. In C, arrays are declared with size known at compile time if using the standard (like static arrays), but here n is input, so we'll need a dynamic array or use a fixed size. Since n is read from input, we can allocate memory for the array using malloc. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the code uses an array of size n, so in C:\n\nint *a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); \n\nAfter that, we can read in the numbers. But let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the imports: the Java code uses java.util.Scanner. In C, we don't need imports; just standard library functions. We'll probably use stdio.h for input/output functions like scanf and printf.\n\nSo first step: include stdio.h and stdlib.h for malloc and free.\n\nNext, the main function's variables. The Java code gets n and m, reads n integers, divides each by 2.\n\nIn C:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    int *a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        a[i] = x / 2;\n    }\n    // then the rest of the logic.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, it loops over each a[i], using a.next(), so the initial a[i] is parsed from next(), so that's correct.\n\nNow, the LCM code. They compute the LCM of all the a[i] elements. The LCM is computed using GCD.\n\nThe GCD method is getGCD(a, b) which uses Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, in C, the GCD function can be written as a helper function.\n\nWait, the GCD function is recursive in Java. But in C, it can be written either recursively or iteratively. Let me see.\n\nJava code's getGCD function is:\n\npublic static long getGCD(long a, long b) {\n    if (b == 0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a % b);\n}\n\nIn C, let's make a function with the same logic. So:\n\nlong getGCD(long a, long b) {\n    if (b == 0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a % b);\n}\n\nThen, for the LCM part. The LCM is computed as (a*b)/gcd(a,b).\n\nSo the code initializes lcd (which should actually be LCM, but in the code it's named as lcd?) to 1 and then iterates:\n\nlong lcd = 1;\n\nThen, for each element in a:\n\nCompute current gcd:\n\ngcd = getGCD(lcd, a[i]);\n\nthen set lcd = (lcd * a[i])/gcd;\n\nBut since in the loop, a[i] can be 0? Maybe not, since the original inputs are probably positive integers (since divided by 2, so maybe a is at least 1?) Well, but the problem constraints aren't considered here, so the code just follows.\n\nBut in C, we can use variables as 64-bit integers. The variables like gcd and lcd need to be of a larger type, perhaps long long, especially since m can be up to some large number similar to m, which might be up to like 1e12, I suppose. Wait, what's the problem's constraints? Well, maybe not important, but in code, in Java, the variables use 'long' but the problem here, translating to C.\n\nLooking at the code's variables: in Java, the GCD function returns long, and the a elements are int. However, even in C, maybe to prevent overflow, the LCM needs to be stored as larger than 32-bit. The LCD (LCM) is stored as 'long' in the Java code. In C, on many systems, a 'long' is 4 bytes (32 bits). If m can be up to 1e12, which requires a 40-bit number, then 32-bit is insufficient. So perhaps in C we need to use 64-bit integers. So in C, we can use long long, which is 64 bits.\n\nSo perhaps in C, all variables like gcd, lcd should be of type long long to avoid integer overflow. Because in the initial Java code, they use 'long' which can handle up to around 9e18 or so, which is similar to 64 bits. So the C variables need to use long long. Let's adjust accordingly.\n\nAh! That's an important point. Because in the original Java code, the variables like 'gcd' and 'lcd' are declared as long to fit large numbers, but in C, if stored as 'long', they might be 32 bits, so using 'long long' is safer. Therefore, the variables need to be 'long long's. So in the loop, variables will need to be declared as such.\n\nSo in the main code, edit variable declarations.\n\nSo, in the main function:\n\nlong long gcd; // for each iteration?\n\nWait the code as written initializes a variable 'long gcd' and 'long lcd'. So in C:\n\nlong long gcd; ?\n\nWait, let's see the Java code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\n    int m = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\n    int[] a = new int[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        a[i] = Integer.parseInt(sc.next()) / 2;\n    }\n    long gcd;\n    long lcd = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        gcd = getGCD(lcd, a[i]);\n        lcd = lcd * a[i] / gcd;\n        if (lcd > m) {\n            System.out.println(0);\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n    // etc.\n\nSo, the a array is int, but when calculating GCD, which is between a[i] (int) and 'lcd' (long). However, in C, since we need to handle big numbers, so 'a' can still be int, as the division by 2 may keep them small, but the LCM accumulates to large numbers. So variables 'gcd' and 'lcd' must be 64-bit integers. Thus, in C:\n\nlong long gcd;\nlong long lcd =1;\n\nBut in the loop, when calculating gcd and the product, since a[i] can be up to... Well, if m is up to 1e12, and n is like the problem's constraints, maybe it makes sense that in C, using long long for gcd, lcd, etc.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nRewriting the code's loop:\n\nlong long gcd;\nlong long lcm = 1; // previously called 'lcd'?\n\nWait the variable is named 'lcd' in the Java code, but maybe the LCM, which is the least common multiple, so perhaps a better name is LCM, but the variables can stay as 'lcd'.\n\nSo in the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n        gcd = getGCD(lcm, a[i]);\n        lcm = lcm * a[i] / gcd;\n\n        if (lcm > (long long)m) { // Wait m is an int, in C it's stored in a normal int, but when we compare, cast to long long to avoid overflow. Wait, m is stored in variable m (from input) which is declared as 'int'? Wait in Java, 'm' is an int as it's taken from next(), same as n. Wait the Java code's variables n and m are int. Well, in C, what's their size?\n\nWait in the problem's context, perhaps m can be up to 1e8 or more? The problem statement for ABC150_D is likely something like m up to 1e18? Not sure, but the code's logic checks if lcm exceeds m. So when converting, the variables for m should be read as 64-bit? Wait in Java, they used Integer.parseInt, which is 32bit. So the input numbers for m must be less than or equal to 2^31-1, which is ~2e9. So in C, instead of declaring m as a normal int (32bit, perhaps), but in code, if the constraints allow m up to 1e9, using a 32-bit int is okay. Wait even 2^31 is about 2e9, so any m value up to that is fine. So in C, m can be declared as 'long long' to be safe. Alternatively maybe just int is enough. Hmm, but in code, when the code uses:\n\nif (lcm > m)\n\nThen in C, if lcm is a long long and m is an int, then during comparison, m is promoted to long long, so no problem. Alternatively to prevent any chance of integer overflow during calculations, it's better to read m as a long long. Wait, perhaps in the problem, m can be up to 1e12, which is 1,000,000,000,000 which is less than 2^32 (which is ~4e9). Wait no, 1e12 is 1,000 billion, bigger than 2^32 (~4.2e9). So if m can be up to 1e12, that requires 40 bits, so must be stored as a 64-bit variable.\n\nWait the problem's constraints? Let me think\u2014the ABC 150 D problem. Looking it up in my mind, the problem may have m up to 1e12. So to be safe, the inputs n and m should be read as long long in C.\n\nWait, in the Java code the variables m and n are 'int's, which in Java are 32 bits. So, perhaps the problem's constraints allow n and m to fit in 32 bits. Because otherwise, the code would have used long for m. Hence, perhaps m is up to 1e9 or so.\n\nWell, let's proceed. The current variables in C:\n\nIn the input:\n\nint n, m;\n\nWe can read them with:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n\n\nWait but that could be an issue if m is larger than 2^31. Hmm. Alternatively perhaps using %lld to read m as long long.\n\nWait in the problem statement for ABC 150 D, from what I recall (the problem was ... when you are to choose some multiples such that...), the constraints for m may allow up to 1e12 or 1e18, etc. Since in the code provided in Java, the variables for m and the LCM are 'long' (64 bits), so that's why in C, m should be stored as a long long. So perhaps in the code translation, the code should read m as long long. \n\nHmm. I need to adjust the variables to prevent overflow. So:\n\nIn the original Java code, m is an int, but since m is compared with 'lcd', which is a long. In the code's check:\n\nif (lcd > m), so the m can be up to 1e9 (since int's max is ~2e9). Wait in Java's int is 32-bit signed, so maximum is ~2e9. If the problem constraints allow m up to 1e12, then this code would have a bug. But the OP provided the Java code, so assuming that the code is correct for its problem constraints, then m can be in 32-bit.\n\nHmm. But regardless, in C, perhaps better to read it as long long to prevent issues, but maybe let's see:\n\nThe code is generated as per the given Java code's logic, so variables in C should match the same size.\n\nThus, in the Java code m is a 32-bit int, but the problem might require it to be a long to cover large values. Wait the code uses\n\nif (lcd > m)\n\nwhere lcd is of type 'long'. So the problem's constraints may permit m to be up to 2^31-1. So in C, when declared as int, 32 bits, then that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to avoid any discrepancy, I should redeclare m as a long long.\n\nWait given that in the original code, we compare an int and a long, so in Java, the int (m) gets promoted to long, so that's okay.\n\nIn C, the integer types:\n\nint is 32 bits, and long long is 64 bits. So:\n\nIn the translation, variables m should be int? Let me note that in the code:\n\nIn the first part of the code, where the for loop computes the LCM, when calculating lcm = (lcm * a[i])/gcd. So the product of two numbers.\n\nSuppose a[i] is up to, say, something like m*2 (since the initial input divided by 2: so original input was up to m*2?)\n\nBut when calculating LCM iteratively each time, it can get big. For example, if all elements are 1, then LCM remains 1. If they're all 2, then LCM becomes 2, etc. The first time when computing lcm would be lcm=1 * a[i]/gcd(1,a[i]). But the problem may have LCM exceeding m even early. The code exits early so it's okay.\n\nBut regardless, since the variables involved (a[i] can be integers), and the LCM can quickly grow. To ensure that in C, the code uses 64-bit integers, I'll make sure all variables involved in 'lcm', 'gcd', are long long. Also, the parameters to the function getGCD should take long long integers.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, the function getGCD should be written in C as:\n\nlong long getGCD(long long a, long long b) {\n    if (b == 0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a % b);\n}\n\nThen in the main function:\n\nWe'll have:\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m; // original Java uses int, so assuming it's okay. but if m can be up to 1e12 or so, perhaps make it a long long.\n\nWait, but the code's input for m comes from the same sources. Let me proceed step by step as per original code. So variables n and m as int.\n\nWait let me think: in the Java code, declaring m as an int can hold up to ~2e9, but maybe in the problem the m could be up to, say, 1e12. In that case, the code would have a bug, but the question says the user provided the Java code is correct. So I have to trust that the given code is correct for the problem, hence the problem's m is within 2^31-1. Thus in C, m as int is okay. The variables a's elements fit in int since they are divided by 2, so original numbers are also within int?\n\nHmm.\n\nThe code in C would have the variables:\n\nint a[n];\n\nWait, but n is read dynamically, so in C, you can't have an array of variable size in C89, but in C99, variable length arrays (VLA) are allowed. Alternatively, use malloc. To be compatible, perhaps better use malloc.\n\nWait, first: in C, the main code would start with:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nlong long getGCD(long long a, long long b);\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    int *a = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        a[i] = x / 2;\n    }\n\n    long long lcm = 1;  \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        long long g = getGCD(lcm, a[i]);\n        lcm = lcm * a[i] / g;\n        if (lcm > m) {\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n            free(a); // need to free allocated memory before returning\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        long long temp = lcm / a[i];\n        if (temp % 2 == 0) {\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    long long ans = (m / lcm + 1) / 2;\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n    free(a); \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait in the code above, after each return, we should free the memory.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, when it outputs 0 and returns, the loop breaks as it is the end of the method. In C, we must free the memory allocated for a before returning, otherwise it's a memory leak. So the code needs a free(a) at the exit points. \n\nWait hold on:\n\nIn the first loop, if LCM exceeds m, code prints 0 and returns. After printing, need to free(a) before return? Because else, the 'a' array will be leaked.\n\nSo modifying:\n\nInside the first for loop's if statement:\n\n        if (lcm > m) {\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\nSimilarly, in the next for loop (second loop checking the evenness):\n\n            if (temp % 2 == 0) {\n                printf(\"0\\n\");\n                free(a);\n                return 0;\n            }\n\nElse, after printing the answer, free(a), and exit.\n\nSo that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, can we use goto statements to jump to a 'cleanup' point, but better to do the 'free' in each check.\n\nNow, check the second condition in the second for loop:\n\nThe original Java code checks whether (lcm / a[i]) is even. Because if so, then there would be some overlapping condition that stops the answer. In the code:\n\nif ((lcd / a[i]) % 2 == 0) { ... }\n\nIn C:\n\nSame.\n\nNow, the final computation:\n\nSystem.out.println((m / lcd +1)/2 );\n\nIn C:\n\nlong long ans = (m / lcm +1)/2;\n\nThen printf\"%lld\\n\". So:\n\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\nBut for m, in C, if m is stored as an 'int', then m / lcm would be (int)/(long long), but should be cast to avoid truncation. Wait: in C, m is an int, so when divided by a long long (lcm), the int is promoted to long long, so it works.\n\nAlternatively, m can be stored as a long long, so:\n\nChanging variables to:\n\nlong long m;\n\nIn main, declared as:\n\nlong long m;\n\nand read with:\n\nscanf(\"%d %lld\", &n, &m); No wait, that's not correct. Because in the problem's input, m is an integer, just like n. But in code, perhaps in the input, m is given as an integer value, but if m is up to 1e12, it can't be stored as 'int', which is 32 bits. Wait 2^32 is about 4e9, so 1e12 requires 40 bits.\n\nSo, to accommodate m that can be up to a large value like 1e12, which is greater than 2^31, the code must store m as a long long. So in that case, the Java code must have an incorrect type here. Because in the original code, m is an 'int', but if m is larger than 2^31, then that would lead to overflow.\n\nHowever, since the original code is provided by the user, perhaps in their problem the constraints limit m <=2^31-1. Otherwise, that code is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows m up to 1e12, so in the Java code's m is declared as 'int' but would cause an overflow. Wait Oh wait, Integer.parseInt(sc.next()) can read an integer value up to 2^31-1. So if the problem's m exceeds that, the code would break. But since the problem is from AtCoder ABC 150 D probably, perhaps their constraints are such that m is <= something like 1e18. Wait, no, in the code they use 'long lcd =1', so the LCM can be up to 1e12...\n\nHmm, perhaps there's inconsistency. It's better to use long long in C for m.\n\nThus, in the code, changing variable m to be 'long long':\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    long long m;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %lld\", &n, &m)!=2) {\n        // handle error but probably unnecessary here\n    }\n    ... rest as before...\n\nWait that way, m is read correctly as a long long, so even if it's a large value up to 1e18, it can be read. But then, when in the first for loop, a[i] are inputs which can be up to (some number such that a[i] = (input number)/2, and input number is up to m. Wait the original code takes x = next(), then a[i] = x/2. So even if input x is up to 2m (can't be larger than m?), probably input numbers must be less than 2*m. So to parse this correctly, the input numbers can be up to 2m. So if m is big, those numbers can be big, so need to read them as 64 bits?\n\nWait, in the code where the input numbers are read as x in C:\n\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\nWait that would read the input as an int, which again may overflow if input x is larger than 2^31 or so. Oh no! This is a problem. For example, if the original number is, say, 2e14, then storing that into x (which is an int) would cause overflow. \n\nAh, so in C, the variables x here cannot be int, if the inputs can be large. Because the inputs for a[i] are (original a number) divided by 2, but each original number can be up up to m.\n\nWait the problem statement requires to read all the a's (which is after division by 2) \u2014 but the original numbers could be up to m (so up to 1e12). Thus, the input numbers for the array elements must be read as 64-bit integers.\n\nWait the initial code in Java, the a[i] is parsed as an 'int' (since sc.next() is an Integer.parseInt). But if the problem allows the input numbers up to m which is up to 1e12, that would be larger than 2^31, causing overflow in the input. Thus, that's a problem in the original code.\n\nWait, but the problem (atcoder ABC150 D) might have such a condition that the product can't exceed m even when considering all elements. So perhaps in the problem's constraints, each ai is actually constrained such that a[i] (the original x) is within reasonable limits?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's constraints means that the sum is impossible when the numbers are big. Because the variables in LCM multiply, but the LCM is limited by m. So, the product may not be too big.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as-is. The original code used Integer.parseInt for all the inputs except for m and n? Wait no:\n\nThe original code's a[i] are derived from sc.next(), which is parsed as an integer, just like n and m. So, in the Java code, all numbers must be within 32-bit integers. Hence the problem's constraints must enforce that all inputs are within 32-bit, hence in C, variables can be as int.\n\nSo given that, proceed with variables n is 'int', m is 'int', and a array elements are 'int' (since divided by 2, even if original is up to 2^31-1, divided by two, remains within same size).\n\nThus, variables:\n\nBut in C's case, the input for the array:\n\nsc.nextInt() could be any integer that fits into an int, so the C code reads them as integers.\n\nSo then, proceeding with:\n\nBut m stored as an 'int'? Only if the problem's m is less than 2e9. So if the problem allows m up to that, then the var m should be int, and when using in code like:\n\n    if(lcm> m) { etc.\n\nBut if m is up to 1e12, that's beyond 2^31 (about 2e9), so that would overflow. So that's the problem. So the code given is possibly incorrect for such cases. But the user's problem requires translating the code as given.\n\nAssuming that in the problem, m is within 2e9, then proceeding:\n\nThe code in C would have:\n\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n    int *a = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; ++i) {\n        int x; scanf(\"%d\",&x);\n        a[i] =x/2;\n    }\n\nThen compute the LCM:\n\nlong long lcm=1;\nfor (int i=0; i <n;++i) {\n    long long g = getGCD(lcm, a[i]); // a[i] is int, so converted to long long for computation.\n\n    lcm = (lcm * a[i])/g;\n\n    if (lcm > (long long)m) { // cast m to prevent overflow?\n    }\n\nWait in this case, in the condition, 'lcm > m'? Since m is an int (32 bits) but lcm is 64 bit. But if m is up to 2^31-1 (max int), then lcm could exceed m even when m is 2^31-1 (2e9), so in that case, the comparison is okay.\n\nYes. So the code in C:\n\nNow, proceed to code.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nFunction definitions:\n\nlong long getGCD(long long a, long long b) {\n    if (b ==0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a%b);\n}\n\nSo the full code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nlong long getGCD(long long a, long long b);\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    \n    int* a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        a[i] = x / 2;\n    }\n\n    long long lcm = 1;\n    long long gcd;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        gcd = getGCD(lcm, a[i]);\n        lcm = (lcm * a[i]) / gcd;\n\n        if (lcm > (long long)m) {\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        long long temp = lcm / a[i];\n        if (temp % 2 == 0) { // if even, then after division by a[i], result must be odd for all?\n            printf(\"0\\n\");\n            free(a);\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    long long ans = (m / lcm + 1) / 2;\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n    free(a);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nlong long getGCD(long long a, long long b) {\n    if (b == 0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a % b);\n}\n\nWait the loop variables:\n\nIn the first LCM loop:\n\nWait \"gcd\" is a long long variable? Because inside loop, gcd is assigned getGCD(...) which returns a long long, so yes.\n\nNow testing possible variables:\n\nThe code calls getGCD(lcm (which could be big) and a[i] (integer). But when passing the a[i], it's promoted to long long since the function parameters are long long. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to note is that division by zero? But the a[i] is derived from user input x / 2. So if x is zero, then a[i] would be zero, but then GCD with a[i]=0 and lcm? Let's see:\n\nSuppose in first iteration, if a[i] is zero, but then the LCM with zero?\n\nWait, problematic because, in the GCD( current\tlcd=1, a[i]=0.\n\nGCD(a,0) is a. But the code would have GCD(1,0) = 1.\n\nSo GCD of 1 and a[i] = a[i]? Hmm.\n\nActually, GCD(a, 0) is |a|. So in getGCD, when b is zero, we return a. So if a is negative, but since a is passed as absolute, but inputs are divided by 2, so a[i] can't be negative? Because the inputs are from problem's numbers, which are positive.\n\nAssuming that the problem requires all a's to be positive. So when a[i] is zero? Probably invalid input. But perhaps the problem guarantees that the inputs are nonzero after division by 2, so that's okay.\n\nNow, testing the code with an example.\n\nTake sample input:\n\nLet's think of a sample test case.\n\nSuppose n=1, m=2, and a has one element: 2. Wait original x is 2. \n\nSo the first steps:\n\nInput n=1, m=2.\n\na[0] is 2/2 =1.\n\nThen LCM starts at 1. For i=0:\n\ngcd is GCD(1,1) \u2192 1.\n\nlc= (1 *1)/1 \u2192 1.\n\n Since 1 \u22642, proceed.\n\nThen next loop: check if any (lcm/a[i]) is even? 'temp = 1/1 =1 \u2192 1 mod 2 is 1, which is okay.\n\nThus, the final ans: m=2 divided by 1 \u2192 2. (2+1)/2 \u2192 (3)/2=1.5 \u2192 but integer division is 1.\n\nWait (2/1 +1)/2 \u2192 (2+1)/2 \u2192 3/2 =1.5 \u2192 so integer division would be 1. But in C, when using (m/lcm +1)/2 \u2192 (2/1 is 2, +1 is 3 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 3/2 is 1.5 \u2192 in integer division, it's 1 (since in C, integer division discards decimal).\n\nWait in code:\n\n(m/lcm) is 2/1 =2, add 1 \u2192 3. 3/2 \u2192 1.5 \u2192 (int division) gives 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nBut actual count?\n\nThe problem is about choosing some integer k in [0, m] which satisfies certain conditions. Wait, need to see the problem's actual condition.\n\nAssuming this is the problem from ABC150_D, which is \"Minimum and Infimum of the Data\", which has problem like choose x and some elements a_i such that each a_i divides x, and the minimum (or maximum). \n\nAlternatively, the C code's answer is correct in this example. \n\nNow, let's see another case where LCM exceeds m.\n\nSuppose n=1, m=1, a is 2 (original x was 4).\n\nWait a[i] = 4/2 = 2. LCM = 1 \u2192 then next step lcm =1*2/GCD(1,2)=2 \u2192 LCM becomes 2. Which is > m=1 \u2192 then the output is 0.\n\nThus, code would print 0.\n\nAnother test case where (lcm/a[i]) is even.\n\nSuppose n=2, all a elements are 2. So LCM is 2.\n\nThen for each a[i], lcm/a[i] is 1. 1 is odd \u2192 so ok.\n\nThe ans is (m/2 +1)/2. If m =4 \u2192 (4/2 +1)=3 \u2192 divided by 2 is 1.5 \u2192 so 1.5 becomes 1? But in C, 3/2 is 1.\n\nBut if m=2, would get (2/2 +1)/2 \u2192 (1+1)/2 \u21921 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, if the two a's are 1 and 2 \u2192 LCM is 2. \n\nCheck for each a_i: LCM/a1 = 2 /1 \u21922 \u2192 even \u2192 so the print0.\n\nThus, code's second loop catches it, returns 0.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nThus, this code should be correct. Now, write it correctly.\n\nWait in the code above, the variables are declared properly:\n\nYes. Now the only thing to note is returning 0 and freeing a whenever returning early.\n\nI think that should be correct.\n\nSo the final translation is the code as written."
