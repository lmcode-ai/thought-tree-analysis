How to do that? Alternatively, in C, since labels are allowed on loops, perhaps:\n\n                    mark the for(i) loop:\n\n                    loop: \n\n                    for (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--) {\n                       ... if not selected and then add questions ...\n\n                      ... when adding a question brings it over, break loop;\n\n                    } Then exiting the loop breaks all. In C, the label goes on the loop, like:\n\n                    loop:\n                        for (int i= ... ) { .... }\n\n                    Then in some inner code, you can break loop;\n\n                    So that should work. Alternatively, there's another way, but that's the closest. So in the C code:\n\n                    When entering the 'if (score < G)' block:\n\n                    label the outer loop (the i loop from D-1 down):\n\n                    int loopAgain = 1;\n\n                    do {\n\n                        loopAgain =0;\n\n                        for( ... ) {\n\n                            if not set, then add:\n\n                                loop again? \n\n                        }\n\n                    } \n\n                    No, perhaps the labeled break is easier. So let me structure that part:\n\n                    // In C:\n\n                    if (score < G) {\n\n                        // enter the second loop to add\n\n                        // use a labeled loop and break on condition:\n\n                        added_some:\n\n                        for (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n                            if ( !( (bit & (1<<i)) ) ) {\n\n                                // this problem is not in the bit set\n\n                                const int problemNumber = i +1;\n\n                                const int perQuestion = problemNumber * 100;\n\n                                // can take up to (p[i]-1) questions. const int maxTake = p[i] -1;\n\n                                for (int j =0; j < maxTake && score < G; j++) {\n\n                                    solve_num +=1;\n\n                                    score += perQuestion;\n\n                                    if (score >= G) {\n\n                                        // break the added_some loop. break added_some; \n\n                                    }\n\n                                }\n\n                            }\n\n                        }\n\n                        // now, if after all, the score is still less than G \u2192 then this combination is impossible, so we can skip. // else continue. \n\n                        // but the code in Java just continues regardless, since it checks at the end:\n\n                    } Wait, but in Java code, even if adding the p[i]-1 questions still not reaches G, the user needs to check whether after trying all possibilities. The Java code's labeled loop exits the for(i) loop once the break occurs. Without the labeled break, the inner j loop would break, but the outer loop would continue. In C, by having the outer loop labeled, we can handle that.",

However, after that, we have to decide if after adding as much as possible (up to p[i]-1, for all possible i's), whether the total score is >=G. \n\n                    Hmm, perhaps the code has to check, but in the Java code's logic, because it starts from D-1 (highest problem), then first adding the last problem's questions will allow finishing early.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe code seems to solve a problem where you have D problems, each with a certain number of points (p[i]) and a bonus (c[i]). The goal is to find the minimum number of questions you need to solve to reach at least G points. \n\nThe approach uses bitmasking to try all possible subsets of the problems. For each subset (represented by a bit), it calculates the total score and the number of solved problems. If the subset's total is less than G, it then tries to add the remaining problems (not in the subset) one by one to see how many more you need to reach G. The minimum such count is tracked and printed.\n\nHmm, translating to C. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, C doesn't have a Scanner class. Instead, we'll use standard C library functions like scanf. So I'll replace the Scanner with scanf.\n\nThe main structure is a loop over all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^D -1). Then for each bitmask, we check which problems are included and calculate the score and count. \n\nWait, in Java, the loop for bit is from 0 to (1 << D). In C, this is the same as shifting bits, but D could be up to, well, whatever is given, but since it's a loop over 2^D, the maximum D would be small (since 2^20 is over a million but manageable?). Probably the problem constraints don't have very large D's.\n\nVariables: Java uses a static final INF, which in C can be a #define macro. So define INF as 100000.\n\nJava uses arrays of int for p and c. In C, same; arrays of int. \n\nThe loop over the bits: in Java, for (int bit=0 ...); in C, same with int.\n\nWait, in C, the loop variables are usually declared in the loop header. Like for (int bit...)\n\nNow, the loop for checking each bit's bits. Let's look at:\n\nIn the first inner loop for each i from 0 to D-1:\n\nIf the ith bit is set (bit & (1<<i)!=0), then add 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i] to score, and add p[i] to solve_num.\n\nThe second part, when the current score is less than G. Then they go through each i from D-1 down, and see which is not part of the bitmask. For those not set, we can try adding the questions in that group, except the last one? Let's see the Java code:\n\nfor (loop, they have a loop labeled 'loop', and then for each i (starting from the end), if that bit is not set, then they loop over j from 0 to p[i]-2. Because p[i]-1 times (since adding p[i] -1 questions?) \n\nWait, in the loop over j from 0 to p[i]-2 (so p-1 questions?), because each j corresponds to one additional question. The total per question is 100*(i+1), so for each j (like j runs p[i]-1 times, adding p[i]-1 questions?), and each time adding 100*(i+1). So that's the sum. The idea here is if adding all the possible questions from this problem except perhaps one, but not all, but that's to optimize? Or if we need to reach the target, then only add as many as needed. Hmm the code does break once the score reaches G.\n\nSo in C, the same logic applies. \n\nWait, in C, loops are straightforward.\n\nNow, the initial code in Java has a loop tag (loop) but in C, labels are not allowed for break/continue except in loops. However, using labels isn't common in C but allowed. Alternatively, maybe a flag variable can be used, but perhaps the code can be structured differently. Alternatively, in the inner loop, we can break once the condition is met.\n\nLet me think: inside the second loop (for the D-1 loop), when we enter because the current score is less than G. Then we look for the first i not set in the bitmask to take some of their questions.\n\nWait the code's second inner loop is for i from D-1 down to 0. For each such i, if the bit is 0, then for j from 0 to (p[i]-2):\n\nWait, the j loop adds (p[i]-1) questions, because p[i]-1 is the number of iterations? Wait, no, the loop runs from 0 to p[i]-2 (so p[i]-1 terms) so that adding p[i]-1 questions. \n\nWait in code: \n\nfor (int j =0; j < p[i]-1; ...) \u2192 that's p[i] -1 iterations. \n\nSo for the ith problem not included, we add as many questions as possible except the last one. Wait, why? Let me think.\n\nMaybe the first part is all problems in the bitmask, which might have given some partial points, but perhaps the problem needs to be considered if adding some partial here. The idea is that if adding all questions in the ith problem would push the score over G. So the process is:\n\nIf after calculating all the bits' contributions, the current score is still below G:\n\nThen we need to see which problem(s) not in the bits can help. \n\nWe check the problems in reverse order (so later ones which give more points per question first). \n\nFor each problem not chosen in the bit (i.e., bit not set), we can take 1..p[i] questions from it. \n\nWait, actually, in this code's approach, they start with the highest number problem? Since D is decreasing from D-1 to 0. \n\nWait when i is going from D-1 downto 0, the i+1 is the problem number. \n\nSo the code's second inner loop is for each i from the highest to lowest problem number. \n\nFor each such i, which was not selected in the bitmask (so (bit & (1<<i)) ==0), then the code loops j from 0 to p[i]-2, so adding p[i]-1 times. So adding the first p[i]-1 questions (each adds 100*(i+1)), and for each of these steps, accumulate the score, and increment the solve_num.\n\nWait, but why not p[i-1]? The total number here is p[i]-1. Maybe because when the problem is not in the bitmask, you can take a subset of the questions from that problem. But the first part (the mask) didn't include it at all. So by adding this loop, it's trying to add as many as needed from this problem. So the idea is to add all but the last question (so p[i]-1) and see if that reaches the target. \n\nBut the code also breaks as soon as the score reaches G, thus finding the earliest possibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the series is such that once you have to take some more questions, you can take from the best possible (highest points first?) problem that wasn't considered. \n\nHmm. \n\nIn any case, translating this logic into C is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about variables:\n\n- D is an int, read via scanf. \n\n- G is a long \u2192 in C, use long long? Because in Java, the G is nextLong(), so in C, we need a variable that can hold numbers up to the problem's constraints. The code's variables:\n\nscore is declared as int in the Java code? Wait, no. Wait in the Java code: the Java code's score is declared as long, but looking again:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\npublic static void main(...) {\n\n    ... \n\n    long G = sc.nextLong();\n\n    int[] p = ... ; // p holds the number of questions in each problem set. \n\nWait the first part:\n\nscore += 100 * (i+1)*p[i] + c[i]; \n\nWait 100*(i+1)*p[i] is (number of questions in problem i) * per question points (100*(problem number)). Then adding the bonus c[i]. \n\nThis sum could be large. For example, with p[i] being large (maybe 10^5?), but in the problem, since D is up to D, but D might be say 10, the maximum p[i] could be, say, 1e5 each? The problem is probably constrained so that 100*(D)* p[i] would fit in an integer. Wait in Java code, the score variable is declared as int? Wait no, wait: looking at the Java code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) \n{\n    ...\n    long G = sc.nextLong();\n    int D = sc.nextInt();\n\n    int[] p = ...;\n    int[] c = ...;\n\n    int min = INF;\n\n    for each bit {\n        // inside\n        int score = 0;\n        int solve_num =0;\n\n        for (i ...) {\n          if (bit ...) {\n               score += (100*(i+1)*p[i] ) + c[i];\n               solve_num += p[i];\n          }\n        }\n\n    ...\n\nWait the Java code uses an 'int score' variable. Wait, but 100*(i+1)*p[i] can be up to, say:\n\nAssuming D is say 10, then i+1 is up to 10. If p[i] is large, like 1e5, then 100 * 10 * 1e5 = 1e7, plus c[i]. If such values, but if there are up to, say 10 such terms, then even that could exceed 2^31? Let me see: but in the problem statement, perhaps the input constrains p and c to be small enough. \n\nWait the code uses int for p[i] and c[i], so p[i] is limited to 32k (as Java's int is 32 bits). So for example, if the problem has D=10, and each p[i] is 1e5, then 1e5*100*10 (i+1 up to 10) \u21921e7 per term. Adding all 1e7 * 10 is 1e8, which fits into a 32-bit integer. Because 2^31 is about 2e9, so okay. So perhaps using int is okay. But the input for G is read as a long, so in the C code, maybe G will be long long, but the variables score, solve_num, min are okay with int. Wait but let me check again.\n\nWait in Java code, the variable that's declared as 'long' is G, but the 'score' variable is int. So, if the sum exceeds Integer.MAX (2^31-1 = 2147483647), there could be an overflow. So maybe in C, we need to use 'long' variables?\n\nWait the problem might require that G can be up to 1e9 or so. Hmm, perhaps the Java code can have overflow unless the input is designed so. But assuming the problem constraints allow using integers for variables here, perhaps the code is okay. \n\nIn C, integers are typically 32-bit, but maybe in some systems 64-bit. To be safe, perhaps the variables 'score' in C should be of type 'long long' if there's a possibility of overflow. \n\nLooking at the problem:\n\nThe original code uses integers for p and c, so maybe the problem constraints are safe. Let me assume that the code can be directly translated with integers for score, except for G which is a long (so in C, using long long for that).\n\nTherefore, variables in C:\n\nint D; \n\nlong long G; \n\nint p[D], c[D]; \n\nBut in C, arrays can be declared with variable size if we use the right construct. Because D is unknown at compilation time. Oh wait, variable-length arrays (VLAs) in C99 are allowed but may not be standard in all compilers. Alternatively, we can allocate dynamically. But the Java code declares p with size D, which is read first.\n\nAlternatively, we can allocate using malloc. Wait:\n\nWait in the main function, the first step is reading D. So after getting D, we can allocate arrays p and c as int arrays of size D. \n\nYes. So after reading D, we can do:\n\nint D = ...; \nint* p = malloc( D * sizeof(int) );\nint* c = malloc( D * sizeof(int) );\n\nThen proceed to read D values each for p and c. \n\nAlternatively, if the C version is allowed to use VLAs, the code can use int p[D], but since D is a variable, in C99 that's allowed as a VLA, but in older compilers... but since it's a basic code, maybe assuming C99.\n\nHmm. Let me choose the VLA approach for simplicity, assuming the compiler supports it.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <limits.h>\n\n#define INF 100000\n\nint main() {\n    int D;\n    long long G;\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &D, &G);\n\n    int p[D], c[D];\n    for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &p[i], &c[i]);\n    }\n\n    int min = INF;\n\n    for (int bit = 0; bit < (1 << D); bit++) {\n        int score = 0;\n        int solve_num = 0;\n        for (int i =0; i<D; i++) {\n            if ( bit & (1 << i) ) {\n                score += 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i];\n                solve_num += p[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (score < G) {\n            // Enter the second part where we need to add some problems not in the mask.\n\n            // The Java code uses a labeled loop and breaks there.\n            // To replicate that, perhaps use a flag or structure loops.\n            // Alternatively, loop over each i from D-1 down to 0:\n            // but check each step to see if we can exit early.\n            // Let's see how to do this. \n\n            // The code goes from D-1 downto 0. For each such i, if the bit is 0, then for each j up to p[i]-2 (so adding p[i]-1 questions)\n            // but break early if score meets target. \n\n            // First, which problem to choose to add?\n\n            // What the Java code does is loop all i (starting from highest problem) that are not in the bitset, and try adding p[i]-1 questions, but potentially break early.\n\n            int found = 0;\n            for (int i = D - 1; i >=0 && score < G; i--) {\n                if ( (bit & (1 << i)) == 0 ) {\n                    // For this problem, not in the bit. We can add some of its questions.\n\n                    // How many to add? To reach at least G, but only as much as needed.\n\n                    // The current problem gives 100*(i+1) per question. \n                    // total points from adding 'k' questions: 100*(i+1)*k.\n\n                    // required additional points to reach: needed = G - score \n\n                    // each additional question gives 100*(i+1) \u2192 the minimal k needed is ceil(needed/(... )) \n\n                    // But perhaps the code approach is different. Let's see what the Java code does:\n\n                    // it goes for j from 0 to (p[i] - 2), which allows adding up to (p[i] -1) questions.\n\n                    // each iteration adds one question (so j is a counter for that). \n\n                    // So for each possible question of the p[i] questions except the last, but why?\n\n                    // Because perhaps in the initial bitmask, when not selected, we can add some questions here (but without getting the bonus c[i]? \n\n                    // Wait, in the first part, the code added things only when the bit was set. So if the bit is not set, the problem's question contributions are not part of the initial sum. \n\n                    // Thus, in this loop, the problem is not part of the bitmask, so when we add some questions, we don't get the c[i] bonus, but only the 100*(i+1) per question. \n\n                    // That's why the code for the second part loops through adding the questions, and adding their score (each 100*(i+1)), not including the c[i]. \n\n                    // The code in second part adds the first p[i]-1 questions (so up to p[i] can be added, but only up to needed?)\n\n                    // Wait, but in the Java code's second part:\n\n                    // The outer for (i starting from D-1) and check if (bit is not set on i).\n\n                    // when i is not in the bitmask:\n\n                    // for (j from 0 to p[i]-2 \u2192 p[i]-1 iterations):\n\n                    // adding 100*(i +1) to score, and add 1 to solve_num. \n\n                    // So each j step adds +1 question \u2192 so the first p[i]-1 questions.\n\n                    // So in total, for that i, the maximum we can add here is p[i]-1 questions. \n\n                    // Then, after that, it breaks if the score reaches G. \n\n                    // The purpose of this loop is to \"take\" up to p[i]-1 questions (the first p-1) but not all. \n\n                    // Wait but why p-1? Maybe because in the problem, solving all questions in a problem gives the bonus, but if we choose some problems in the bitmask, then they contribute their all +c[i]. \n\n                    // Whereas in this scenario, we are not including the entire problem (since bit is not set). So here, the second part can only add the points from individual questions (without the bonus). \n\n                    So in this path (when total score is less than G), the code is trying to add the maximum possible points from the \"unchoosen\" problem i, so as to reach G as quickly as possible (with minimum questions). \n\n                    // So the strategy here is to take the largest possible per question (i.e. highest i first), so that each question adds the maximum possible points per question, thus using as few as possible questions to reach G. \n\n                    // So in the Java code's loop, it starts from i = D-1 (highest numbered problem first). \n\n                    // The code loops through j for p[i]-1 iterations, which allows adding up to p[i]-1 questions from that problem. \n\n                    // Wait, but adding p[i]-1 questions would give a score of 100*(i+1)*(p[i]-1). \n\n                    // So in this case, perhaps in the loop for j from 0 to (p[i] - 2):\n\n                    // each j adds 1 question. \n\n                    // So in code terms:\n\n                    // for ( ... ; j < p[i] -1 ; )\n\n                    // So to replicate this, perhaps we need to loop:\n\n                    for (int j =0 ; j < p[i] -1 && score < G; j++) {\n\n                        score += 100*(i+1);\n\n                        solve_num +=1;\n\n                        if (score >= G) break;\n                    }\n\n                    // Since we want to take as many points as needed from this problem. Once we've added enough to pass G, we can stop.\n\n                    // Thus, this loop will add j from 0 up to (number needed) -1, but to a max of (p[i]-1). \n\n                    // So the variable 'j' loops until either it reaches p[i]-1 or we hit the target. \n\n                    // Therefore the code can be rewritten as:\n\n                    // So, in the C code, for each such i not set, run:\n\n                    int possible = p[i] -1; // maximum questions we can add here.\n\n                    for (int j=0; j < possible && score < G; j++) {\n\n                        score += (i+1)*100; \n\n                        solve_num++;\n\n                        // check if we've passed the goal, break out early.\n\n                        if(score >= G) {\n\n                            break;\n\n                        } \n\n                    }\n\n                    // if after adding j up to possible, but still below G, then maybe this cannot work, so skip.\n\n                    // Wait, but after this loop, if score is still less than G, then trying adding all the remaining p[i] possible questions? But then we also need to consider other i's?\n\n                    Hmm wait, in the Java code, after the inner loops, the code breaks to the outer loop labeled 'loop'. The 'loop' is the entire for loop over i.\n\n                    So in the Java version, if at any point the break 'loop' is executed, it exits the loop over i. \n\n                    In the C version, to achieve similar functionality, after adding a question and reaching the required score, the code can break all loops up to the for(i) loop and proceed.\n\n                    How to do that?\n\n                    Alternatively, in C, since labels are allowed on loops, perhaps:\n\n                    mark the for(i) loop:\n\n                    loop: \n\n                    for (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--) {\n                       ... if not selected and then add questions ...\n\n                      ... when adding a question brings it over, break loop;\n\n                    }\n\n                    Then exiting the loop breaks all.\n\n                    In C, the label goes on the loop, like:\n\n                    loop:\n                        for (int i= ... ) { .... }\n\n                    Then in some inner code, you can break loop;\n\n                    So that should work. Alternatively, there's another way, but that's the closest.\n\n                    So in the C code:\n\n                    When entering the 'if (score < G)' block:\n\n                    label the outer loop (the i loop from D-1 down):\n\n                    int loopAgain = 1;\n\n                    do {\n\n                        loopAgain =0;\n\n                        for( ... ) {\n\n                            if not set, then add:\n\n                                loop again? \n\n                        }\n\n                    } \n\n                    No, perhaps the labeled break is easier.\n\n                    So let me structure that part:\n\n                    // In C:\n\n                    if (score < G) {\n\n                        // enter the second loop to add\n\n                        // use a labeled loop and break on condition:\n\n                        added_some:\n\n                        for (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n                            if ( !( (bit & (1<<i)) ) ) {\n\n                                // this problem is not in the bit set\n\n                                const int problemNumber = i +1;\n\n                                const int perQuestion = problemNumber * 100;\n\n                                // can take up to (p[i]-1) questions.\n\n                                const int maxTake = p[i] -1;\n\n                                for (int j =0; j < maxTake && score < G; j++) {\n\n                                    solve_num +=1;\n\n                                    score += perQuestion;\n\n                                    if (score >= G) {\n\n                                        // break the added_some loop.\n\n                                        break added_some; \n\n                                    }\n\n                                }\n\n                            }\n\n                        }\n\n                        // now, if after all, the score is still less than G \u2192 then this combination is impossible, so we can skip. \n\n                        // else continue. \n\n                        // but the code in Java just continues regardless, since it checks at the end:\n\n                    }\n\n                    Wait, but in Java code, even if adding the p[i]-1 questions still not reaches G, the user needs to check whether after trying all possibilities. \n\n                    The Java code's labeled loop exits the for(i) loop once the break occurs. Without the labeled break, the inner j loop would break, but the outer loop would continue. \n\n                    In C, by having the outer loop labeled, we can handle that. \n\n                    So, in the above code structure for the C version's 'score < G' case:\n\n                    The 'added_some' loop is labeled. Within the j loop, when the score >=G, break added_some, so the code exits both i and j loops early.\n\n                    So in this way, the added checks are done.\n\n                    However, after that, we have to decide if after adding as much as possible (up to p[i]-1, for all possible i's), whether the total score is >=G. \n\n                    Hmm, perhaps the code has to check, but in the Java code's logic, because it starts from D-1 (highest problem), then first adding the last problem's questions will allow finishing early. \n\n                    So, after the inner loops, we can compute whether the final score is >= G. \n\n                    Then, after processing, the code checks if (score >= G) then min is updated.\n\n                    So in code, this seems okay. \n\n                    Proceeding, once this part is handled.\n\n                    Now, after the loops, the code checks whether score >= G, and then compares to the current min.\n\n                    Now, for the problem variables:\n\n                    So, the variables:\n\n                        int score, solve_num initialized to 0.\n\n                        Then after the initial loop over set bits.\n\n                        Then condition: if (score < G) \u2192 proceed to the loop.\n\n                        After looping, the code proceeds.\n\n                    Now putting this together.\n\n                    The rest:\n\n                    Now, the variables D, G are read first.\n\n                    Also, note that in C, loops over bit are up to (1<<D). \n\n                    That will be the same.\n\n                    Now considering the initial min is INF (100000). \n\n                    Also, in Java, the Math.min and the loop continues. \n\n                    Finally, when the bit loop concludes, print min.\n\n                    Now, what about the case where there is no solution? The problem likely ensures that there's at least one way to get G.\n\n                    The INF is initially set to 100000, so if after all loops the min isn't reset, but maybe in code constraints, that can't happen.\n\n                    Also, in C, to print, use printf(\"%d\\n\", min).\n\n                    So, putting all together, here's the C code:\n\n                    Also, remember to close the file, but in C, there's no scanner.close(); but in Java. However in C, no need for closing stdin.\n\n                    Now, writing the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define INF 100000\n\nint main() {\n\n    int D;\n\n    long long G;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &D, &G);\n\n    int p[D], c[D];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<D; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &p[i], &c[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int min = INF;\n\n    for (int bit =0; bit < (1 << D); bit++) {\n\n        int score =0, solve =0;\n\n        for(int i=0; i<D; i++) {\n\n            if( (bit & (1<<i)) ) {\n\n                score += (100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]);\n\n                solve += p[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if( score >= G ) {\n\n            // this is better than the previous case (if better, evaluate)\n\n            if (solve < min) {\n\n                min = solve;\n\n            }\n\n            continue; // else can continue loops\n\n        }\n\n        else {\n\n            // the score is below; try to add some problems not in the bit\n\n            int did_add =0;\n\n            // start from highest problem to lower\n\n            // and attempt to add from them:\n\n            addedloop:\n\n            for( int i = D-1; i>=0; i-- ) {\n\n                if ( (bit & (1<<i)) ==0 ) {\n\n                    // add as much as we can from problem (i+1) questions\n\n                    int cnt_max = p[i] -1; // can take maximum (p[i]-1) questions\n\n                    for(int j=0; j < cnt_max; j++) { \n\n                        solve +=1;\n\n                        score += 100*(i+1);\n\n                        // check if now sufficient:\n\n                        if (score >= G) {\n\n                            break addedloop;\n\n                        }\n\n                    }\n\n                    // after the j loop, check again if reached? \n\n                    // Even after adding all (p[i]-1), but not yet sufficient:\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            // after adding all possible, check:\n\n            if( score >= G ) {\n\n                if ( solve < min ) {\n\n                    min = solve;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", min);\n\n}\n\nWait, but there's an error here. \n\nBecause after adding up in the j loop for problem i, the code breaks out of the i loop only when sufficient.\n\nWait, in the code above, inside the addedloop: \n\nfor each i (starting from D-1 down to 0), if not in the bit, then try loops the j:\n\nso each iteration of j adds some points. Once one j reaches the requirement, the addedloop breaks (the break addedloop).\n\nOtherwise, once all j loops are done, continue to the next i.\n\nThus, this would try to add from problem D-1 (highest) first. If adding all their available allows the total to reach G, then we stop. \n\nThis is the same as the Java code's approach. \n\nWait in the code draft above, the loop variables:\n\nThe 'did_add' is unused, remove that variable.\n\nAlso, the code after the addedloop's processing:\n\nIf after adding in all possible, the score is sufficient, then check if it's better. \n\nThus, finally, after adding, check: score >= G?\n\nYes. \n\nWait another problem is that in the case where after the initial additions plus the partial additions, the total is >= G. \n\nNow, in the code above:\n\nOnce the addedloop is done (either via the break or by continuing all i's and j's), the code will proceed to the check:  if (score >=G) \u2192 then compute min.\n\nWait yes:\n\nAfter both scenarios (either the original combination had score >=G, and after adding partial ones, also \u2192 we check the code:\n\nThis:\n\nSo first, in the code's first case, if the original score is already >= G \u2192 we enter the 'if' block, updates the min and continues to next bit.\n\nIn the else block, the code runs the addedloop. \n\nAfter the addedloop is done, the code performs: if the score is now >= G \u2192 then updates the min.\n\nNow, the code can have cases where after adding the partial problems' questions, the score reaches or exceeds G, so we consider whether the solve_num is below the current min.\n\nThus, this is correct.\n\nWait in the code draft, after the loop, the 'solve' is the 'solve' variable before the partial additions plus the increments. Wait, is the 'solve' variable properly tracked?\n\nYes, the 'solve' variable is initialized to 0. \n\nIn the initial loops for the bit set bits: added p[i].\n\nThen, the addedloop may add some more solve_num (solve +=1 each j).\n\nThus, the variable 'solve' is correct.\n\nNow, potential issue is in C's for loop variables. \n\nWait in the inner loops, variables like i are in different scopes. For example, the loop variable in the loop over the bits is 'i', but the inner for(int i=0 ...) in the first check is okay as a separate scope.\n\nYes, because in each loop, the variables are declared. \n\nAnother possible variable to consider is 'score'. It's correctly incremented.\n\nNow,testing the conditions:\n\nIn the addedloop:\n\nWhen adding j from 0 to p[i]-1-1 \u2192 no, because j < cnt_max, which is p[i]-1. Since 'cnt_max' is p[i]-1 \u2192 j can be 0... p[i]-2 (so total p[i]-1 iterations). \n\nYes, so adding p[i]-1 questions \u2192 each adds 100*(i+1). \n\nNow another point:\n\nIn the loops for the addedloop, the initial 'i' runs from D-1 downto 0. \n\nIf we reach a problem not in the bitmask (i.e., (bit & (1<<i) ==0) ), then attempt to add as much as possible (up to p[i]-1 questions). \n\nThe question is: doing that is correct, because those added questions are part of the optimal solution.\n\nAnother possible scenario is whether there's a better way of selecting fewer questions by mixing, but since the code is trying all bitmasks (which represents which problem's full set is taken), and within that, for the problems not in the bitmask, we try to add questions from the highest i first, that's optimal because those give more points per question. \n\nSo the code's approach is valid. \n\nNow, in the second case after adding questions, the solve_num may be updated beyond what is possible.\n\nWait: when adding the questions, after adding up to all p-1 questions from a problem, then further problems may also contribute. But since we're breaking out of the i loop once the target is met, that's not a problem. \n\nWait because once score reaches or exceeds G during a j loop, we break addedloop, so the code stops adding further and only processes the current j's and breaks early, so no overcounting.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, working through edge cases: \n\nFor example if D=1, i=0:\n\nthen 1<<1 = 2 \u2192 bits 0 and 1.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose p[0] is 3, and c[0] is 0.\n\nSuppose D=1 and G is 200. Let's see:\n\nLet D=1, G=200.\n\nSo possible bitmask is 0 or 1. \n\nmask 0:\n\nunsolved \u2192 then we must add questions from this problem (which is not in the mask). \n\nWe can add up to 2 questions:\n\neach is 100*(0+1)*1 (problem i is 1). So 100*q, where q is number added. 2 questions gives 200, which meets G. \n\nSo 'score' would be 200. \n\nsolve_num =0 (initial) + 2 = 2 \u2192 min (assuming min was 100000). \n\nBut in the mask 1 \u2192 then it initially does:\n\nscore += 100*1 *3 (p[0] is 3?) plus c[0].\n\nIf c[0] is 0: then score is 300 which is \u2265200, so solve is 3. But the min would be 2. \n\nSo the code works correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when exactly achieving with the partial additions. \n\nAnother note: in the code, the 'solve' is initialized to 0, then (set) bits are added. \n\nThe code now looks correct.\n\nNow compiling potential mistakes:\n\nIn the code, after the initial loops (for the set bits), when checking the score:\n\nif (score < G), then code proceeds to add the partial.\n\nWait in the else statement, after the j loops, the code will update min only if the score meets after the added.\n\nThus, this logic is okay.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nHmm, but another thing in Java: in the for (j loop in the C code), the loop is for j < cnt_max (which is p[i]-1), whereas in Java's code, the j loop is from 0 to p[i]-2 (exclusive?), thus same as j < p[i]-1 \u2192 which is the same as in the C code's j < cnt_max (since p[i]-1 is p[i] -1).\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nRegarding the min initialization: Java uses static int INF = 100000 \u2192 so initial min is 100000. So in C code, min = INF (using the #define INF 100000). So yes.\n\nThus, the C code is correct. Now to write the actual code.\n\nNow, correcting the previous code draft:\n\nWait in the original Java code's second part, after adding some questions (in the j loops), the code only adds up to G, but can stop early.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, coding the code:\n\nNow, the code would look like this:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define INF 100000\n\nint main() {\n    int D;\n    long long G;\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &D, &G);\n\n    int p[D];\n    int c[D];\n    for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &p[i], &c[i]);\n    }\n\n    int min = INF;\n\n    for (int bit = 0; bit < (1 << D); bit++) {\n        int score = 0;\n        int solve = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n            if (bit & (1 << i)) {\n                score += 100 * (i + 1) * p[i] + c[i];\n                solve += p[i];\n            }\n        }\n        \n        if (score >= G) {\n            if (solve < min) min = solve;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // else: need to add some\n\n        // Loop over the bits from higher to lower, adding questions\n        addedLoop:\n        for (int i = D - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if ((bit & (1 << i)) == 0) {\n                // not selected: can add up to p[i] -1 questions (but break early)\n                int addition = p[i] - 1;\n                for (int j = 0; j < addition; j++) {\n                    solve++;\n                    score += 100 * (i + 1);\n                    if (score >= G) break addedLoop;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (score >= G) {\n            if (solve < min) min = solve;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", min);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in this code, the loop 'addedLoop' is labeled. The 'break addedLoop' would exit the for loop over 'i' (the one labeled addedLoop) and proceed to the 'if (score >= G)' check. \n\nYes. \n\nNow testing edge case:\n\nIf the partial addition reaches G, then 'solve' is computed correctly.\n\nAnother point: if some of the problems not in the bitmask have p[i] -1 added questions, but the total after adding those may be beyond, which is okay.\n\nAnother issue: the 'solve' variable is modified in the adding phase, thus the solve_num is correctly tracked. \n\nAlso, the loop in addedLoop:\n\nOnce the 'break addedLoop' is done, any further 'i' loops in the loop are skipped. \n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
