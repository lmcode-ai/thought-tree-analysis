Or let me see. Let's see example where answer is non-zero. Suppose:\n\nSuppose VD=3, VP=1, T=1, F=1, C=5. Then:\n\nInitial start=1. First iteration:\n\nx =1 *1 / (3-1)=1/2 =0.5. start +x =1.5. 1.5 *VP (1) =1.5 <5. Thus, we have to continue: start += 2*0.5 +1 \u2192 2*0.5 is 1 +1 adds 2. So new start is 1+ (1+1)=3? Wait wait, wait: Wait curr start is 1, then:\n\nafter x is computed as 0.5, the check passes to say not breaks. then start becomes start + 2*x + F \u2192 1 + 1.0 +1 \u2192 which is 3.\n\nand answer increments to 1. Second loop:\n\nNow start is 3. x = 3 *1/(3-1)= 3/2 =1.5. \n\nstart +x =4.5 \u2192 4.5 *1 =4.5 <5 \u2192 still not enough. thus, proceed again:\n\nstart += 2*1.5 +1 \u2192 2*1.5 is 3, plus 1 \u2192 F is 1. So added to current start of 3 gives 3 +3+1 =7?\n\nWait yes: the new start is previous start (3) plus (2*x + F). So 3 + 2*1.5 (3) +1 (F's value is 1). So total increment: 3+3+1=7? So the new start is 3 + 3 +1 = 7. answer now increments to 2. Then next iteration:\n\nx =7 *1/(3-1) \u21927/2=3.5.\n\nstart +x =10.5, multiplied by VP 1 \u219210.5 >=5 \u2192 so break.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me start by looking through the Java code step by step. The code is solving some problem, probably from Codeforces, given the class name. Let me parse what it's doing.\n\nFirst, the Java code imports Scanner, which in C we can replace with standard input functions like scanf. Then the main method reads several integers: VP, VD, T, F, C. The logic checks if VD is less than or equal to VP; if so, it prints 0. Otherwise, it enters a loop calculating some x and increments answer each time until a condition is met. The answer is printed at the end.\n\nAlright, translating this to C. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. **Include necessary headers**: In C, for input/output, we need stdio.h. Also, since we're using double variables, math.h might not be needed here unless we needed some math functions, but looking at the code, the divisions are straightforward.\n\n2. **Declare variables**: The Java code declares variables like VP, VD etc. as doubles. Wait, but in the code, they are initialized with nextInt(), which is an int. But they are declared as doubles. Hmmm. Because in Java, Scanner.nextInt() returns an integer, but the variables are doubles here. So in C, perhaps it's better to read them as integers first, then cast to doubles. Let me see the C code structure.\n\nWait, in C, the input will be via scanf, which can read integers into integer variables first, then cast to double when computing. Because in C, you can't read into a double with scanf using %d, that's wrong. Wait, no: the data types in scanf format must match. For integers, use %d. To read into double, perhaps %lf is used, but since the inputs are definitely integers. The Java code reads them as nextInt(), so in C, they can be stored as integers first, maybe as integers first, then converted to doubles.\n\nBut looking at the code's variables: VP is VP, VD, T, F, C. Let's see in the Java code:\n\nVP = in.nextInt();\n\nSo all variables are being read as integers, stored as double variables. So in C, perhaps read the variables into integers first, then assign to double variables for computation.\n\nSo variables:\n\ndouble VP, VD, T, F, C;\n\n... but read using scanf as integers. Wait:\n\nWait no. For example, in Java:\n\ndouble VP = in.nextInt();\n\nWhich takes an int and assigns to double (autoboxing, but in Java the compiler handles that). So in C, we can read them into integers then assign to double variables. Alternatively, scan as doubles directly. Let me think. Since in the code these variables are used in divisions, perhaps better to declare them as double and scan as %lf? But the inputs are integers. Hmm.\n\nWait, in C, the format specifiers for scanf:\n\nFor a double, you use %lf. So for each of these variables, you can scan using %lf, but the input are integers, but they can be read as doubles. Alternatively, read into integers and then cast.\n\nLet me see: Suppose I declare integers:\n\nint VP_int, VD_int, ... etc. Not sure. But let's proceed.\n\nSo in C code:\n\n#include<stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int VP, VD, T, F, C;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\", &VP, &VD, &T, &F, &C);\n    // convert to doubles if needed for calculations.\n    double VPd = VP;\n    double VDd = VD;\n    ... etc. Or perhaps we can use them directly.\n\nWait, but in the code, for example, the following line:\n\nx = start * VP / (VD - VP);\n\nHere, VP and VD are used with division. Since in Java they are doubles, in C code, if they are integers, then division would be integer division, so better to have as doubles.\n\nSo better to read as doubles in C. Wait, but how? Let me think again:\n\nWait, the code reads inputs with nextInt() so the variables are integers. So in C, I should read using integers first, then assign to double variables. Let me structure variables as such:\n\ndouble VP = (double) VP_int;\n\nWait perhaps better to use double variables from the start. So in C, declare as double variables and read via scanf with %lf. So here's the approach:\n\nIn C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    double VP, VD, T, F, C;\n    if (scanf(\"%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf\", &VP, &VD, &T, &F, &C)!=5) {\n        // error handling, but maybe not needed for codeforces problem.\n    }\n    ... \n\nBut wait, the problem states that inputs are integers. But using %lf will read a double (since in C, a double is 64 bit, so scanf requires %lf for double). Alternatively, maybe using float variables and %f, but no, since the problem uses doubles. Let me confirm, in Java, nextInt() gives an integer, so when stored in a double, it's as if converted to double.\n\nSo in C, variables can be declared as double, and read in via %lf, even if input is integer. So that's manageable.\n\nSo step 1 is variable declarations and input.\n\nNext, the first condition:\n\nif (VD <= VP) { printf(\"0\\n\"); return; } \n\nIn C, return from main would be return 0; but here, in Java, if the condition is met, it outputs 0 and exits. So, first, check VD <= VP, if yes printf(\"0\\n\"); and return 0.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nanswer is an integer, initialized to 0.\n\nIn Java:\n\nint answer=0;\ndouble start=T;\nwhile (true) {\n  double x = start * VP/(VD - VP);\n  if ( (start + x ) * VP >= C ) break;\n  start += 2*x + F;\n  answer++;\n}\n\nSo in C, the variables are same. Let's see:\n\nWe need to have:\n\ndouble start = T;\nint answer=0;\n\nThen loop:\n\nwhile(1) {\n   // compute x\n   x = start * VP / (VD - VP);\n   if( (start + x)*VP >= C ) break;\n   start += 2*x + F;\n   answer++;\n}\n\nWait but in C, variables need to be declared before. So first, inside the loop, if x is declared as a temporary, maybe inside the loop each time.\n\nWait, in the loop:\n\nIn C, you can declare variables inside a block, but for older C standards (like C89) variable declarations must be at top. However, assuming we can use C99, then inside block is okay.\n\nAlternatively, set x as a double variable outside.\n\nSo variables initialization:\n\nInitialize answer=0, and start=T.\n\nThen declare variables x inside loop or as a temporary.\n\nLet's look at the code in C step by step.\n\nTranslating the loop steps:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nCompute x as:\n\nx = start * VP / (VD - VP);\n\nThen check if (start +x)* VP >= C. If yes, break out of loop.\n\nElse, update start by adding 2*x +F, then increment answer.\n\nSo the loop proceeds until (start +x)*VP is at least C.\n\nOnce loop breaks, print the answer.\n\nNow, possible code:\n\nIn main, after reading variables:\n\nif (VD <= VP) {\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint answer =0;\ndouble start = T;\n\nwhile(1) {\n    double x = start * VP/(VD - VP);\n\n    if( (start +x)*VP >= C ) break;\n\n    start += (2*x)+F;\n\n    answer++;\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", answer);\n\n Wait, but division with VP/(VD - VP) could be a problem if VD - VP is zero, but that's already checked in the first condition.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nWait, but in the formula:\n\nx is start * VP divided by (VD - VP). Since VD > VP, denominator is positive, so division okay.\n\nSo the code seems manageable.\n\nPotential issues I need to check:\n\n1. In C, using doubles properly.\n\nWait, variables VP, VD etc. are declared as double, so the math is correct in the equations.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. Let's see.\n\nAnother possible issue is the loop condition. The loop breaks when (start +x)*VP >= C.\n\nWait, let me think: (start + x) is the time taken perhaps?\n\nLet me see the logic:\n\nThe code is probably trying to calculate the number of times the \"rest\" and adding steps are needed to get the cumulative distance to reach or exceed C.\n\nBut since the code is written in the Java version, the C translation should mirror exactly the logic.\n\nAnother possible issue is the variables in the loop:\n\nIn each iteration, x is calculated, then if condition met, break. else, add 2*x +F to start. Each iteration adds an increment to answer.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    double VP, VD, T, F, C;\n    scanf(\"%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf\", &VP, &VD, &T, &F, &C);\n\n    if (VD <= VP) {\n        printf(\"0\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int answer = 0;\n    double start = T;\n\n    while (1) {\n        double x = start * VP / (VD - VP);\n        if ((start + x) * VP >= C) {\n            break;\n        }\n        start += 2 * x + F;\n        answer++;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", answer);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the variables are read with nextInt() so the input is integer, but in the C code, the variables are double and scanned as %lf. For example, if the input is 5 10 20 30 100, then stored as 5.0, etc. so that should be okay.\n\nBut perhaps in cases where the division or multiplication can lead to floating points, but that's the same as in Java.\n\nAnother possible point: in the loop, variables are all doubles. So calculations are accurate.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs would help. For example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose VP=1, VD=2, T=3, F=4, C=5.\n\nFirst, VD > VP (2>1), so proceed.\n\nstart is initialized to T=3.\n\nLoop entry:\n\nx=3 * 1 / (2-1)= 3*1/1 = 3. So, start +x = 3 +3=6. The condition checks if 6 *1 (VP is 1) is >= C (5. Since 6 >=5, the condition is true. So, loop breaks, answer remains 0. Then the code prints 0? Wait, but that would be the case.\n\nWait, but answer was initialized to 0, so the first step would compute x, and stop, so answer would be zero? Or let me see.\n\nLet's see example where answer is non-zero. Suppose:\n\nSuppose VD=3, VP=1, T=1, F=1, C=5.\n\nThen:\n\nInitial start=1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx =1 *1 / (3-1)=1/2 =0.5. start +x =1.5. 1.5 *VP (1) =1.5 <5.\n\nThus, we have to continue: start += 2*0.5 +1 \u2192 2*0.5 is 1 +1 adds 2. So new start is 1+ (1+1)=3? Wait wait, wait:\n\nWait curr start is 1, then:\n\nafter x is computed as 0.5, the check passes to say not breaks.\n\nthen start becomes start + 2*x + F \u2192 1 + 1.0 +1 \u2192 which is 3.\n\nand answer increments to 1. \n\nSecond loop:\n\nNow start is 3.\n\nx = 3 *1/(3-1)= 3/2 =1.5. \n\nstart +x =4.5 \u2192 4.5 *1 =4.5 <5 \u2192 still not enough.\n\nthus, proceed again:\n\nstart += 2*1.5 +1 \u2192 2*1.5 is 3, plus 1 \u2192 F is 1. So added to current start of 3 gives 3 +3+1 =7?\n\nWait yes: the new start is previous start (3) plus (2*x + F). So 3 + 2*1.5 (3) +1 (F's value is 1). So total increment: 3+3+1=7?\n\nSo the new start is 3 + 3 +1 = 7. \n\nanswer now increments to 2.\n\nThen next iteration:\n\nx =7 *1/(3-1) \u21927/2=3.5.\n\nstart +x =10.5, multiplied by VP 1 \u219210.5 >=5 \u2192 so break.\n\nSo total answer is 2. \n\nSo the formula would compute 2. \n\nTesting with this case would require seeing if the code would output 2.\n\nBut that's assuming my calculation is correct.\n\nNow in terms of code, the translation should handle this case.\n\nAnother note: the code uses a while(true) loop, which is allowed in C.\n\nAnother thing is variable declarations in the loop: the double x is declared inside the loop, so each time, it's reinitialized. That's correct.\n\nNow possible issue with precision:\n\nThe Java code uses doubles. So does the C code. Since both are using double-precision variables, the calculations should match.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow putting it all together, the C code would have the includes, variables read properly, loop same as Java.\n\nSo I think that's the correct translation."
