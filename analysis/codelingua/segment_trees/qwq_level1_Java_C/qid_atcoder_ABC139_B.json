For negative numbers, but I think in this problem, A and B are probably positive as per the problem constraints (since it's an AtCoder problem, which likely has constraints like A >=2, B >= A or something). So modulo here is okay. Wait but division in C when the divisor is a variable, but we have to make sure that A-1 isn't zero. Let me think.",

The initial values don't matter. Alternatively, maybe better to initialize them to zero just in case, but it's not necessary here. Let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nresult is set to (B-1)/(A-1), so before that line, it's uninitialized. If the variables are declared but not initialized, that's undefined behavior. Therefore, it's better to declare them with 0, or assign them. Therefore in C:\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    int amari =0, result =0;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B) ! =2) { /* handle error */ } \n    // But since it's a programming competition problem, assume inputs are correct\n    // compute\n    result = (B-1)/(A-1);\n    amari = (B-1) % (A-1);\n    if (amari ! =0) {\n        result++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n} Wait I can also replace the if with using the ceiling formula.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me start by understanding what the code does. \n\nThe Java program reads two integers A and B from standard input. Then it calculates some result based on those values. The main calculation is (B-1)/(A-1), then checks the remainder. If there's a remainder, it adds 1 to the result. Finally, it prints the result.\n\nSo first, I need to figure out how to do similar input/output in C. Java uses Scanner and PrintWriter, but in C, I'll use scanf and printf. Alright.\n\nThe variables A and B are integers. The variables amari and result are also integers. Let's see the steps:\n\n1. Read A and B. In Java, Scanner.next() gets the next token, which in this case are the two integers. So in C, I can use scanf with \"%d %d\" to read them.\n\n2. Compute result = (B -1)/(A -1). But in C, division of integers truncates toward zero. Wait, but then the remainder part. The code checks if (B-1) % (A-1) is non-zero. If so, adds 1. So perhaps the division here is integer division. \n\nWait the formula is similar to ceiling division. Like when you divide (B-1) by (A-1), but if there's a remainder, you need to round up. Because (B-1)/(A-1) might be an integer division, so adding 1 when there is a remainder would effectively compute the ceiling. \n\nFor example, let's see. Suppose (B-1) divided by (A-1) is 5.2, then (B-1)/(A-1) would be 5, but since the remainder is non-zero, the result becomes 6. If it's exactly divisible, then it stays as 5.\n\nYes, that's how that code works.\n\nIn C, the same logic should apply. So translating the logic is straightforward.\n\nNow the steps in C:\n\n- Declare variables: int A, B, amari, result;\n\n- Read from stdin using scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n- Then calculate the same as in Java:\n\nresult = (B - 1) / (A - 1);\n\namari = (B -1) % (A -1);\n\nif (amari !=0) result++;\n\nWait, but in C, the modulo operator behaves how? For negative numbers, but I think in this problem, A and B are probably positive as per the problem constraints (since it's an AtCoder problem, which likely has constraints like A >=2, B >= A or something). So modulo here is okay.\n\nWait but division in C when the divisor is a variable, but we have to make sure that A-1 isn't zero. Let me think. The original Java code doesn't have any error checking. So perhaps the problem ensures that A is not 1. Let's assume that. Otherwise, if A is 1, then A-1 would be 0, leading to division by zero. So in the problem's context, that's probably part of the input constraints. So I don't have to handle that here.\n\nSo the code can proceed as is.\n\nThen print the result with printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\nNow, putting it all together in C. The C code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n    int amari = 0, result = 0;\n    result = (B -1)/(A -1);\n    amari = (B -1) % (A -1);\n    if (amari !=0) result +=1;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHmm, but in C, variable declarations can be at the top. So variables should be declared before any executable statements. Let me check. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIn C89, variables have to be declared before any code, so the declarations of amari and result need to be at the top of the function.\n\nYes. So the code would have the variables declared at the top, like:\n\nint A, B, amari, result;\n\nThen in code, the other assignments.\n\nWait the original Java code has:\n\nint amari = 0;\nint result =0;\n\nBut in C, I can declare them with initialization:\n\nint A, B;\nint amari =0, result=0;\n\nWait but in C, declarations are made first. So inside main:\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    int amari =0, result=0;\n    // rest\n}\n\nAlternatively, the code can set them after, but initializing them is redundant because they are set immediately after. \n\nLooking back at Java code: the variables amari and result are initialized but then immediately assigned after. In the C version, perhaps it's okay to not initialize them, since they will be assigned before used. So maybe:\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    int amari, result;\n    scanf(...);\n    result = ...;\n    amari = ...;\n}\n\nBut that's okay because their assignments happen before they're used. The initial values don't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to initialize them to zero just in case, but it's not necessary here. Let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nresult is set to (B-1)/(A-1), so before that line, it's uninitialized. If the variables are declared but not initialized, that's undefined behavior. Therefore, it's better to declare them with 0, or assign them.\n\nTherefore in C:\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    int amari =0, result =0;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B) !=2) { /* handle error */ } \n    // But since it's a programming competition problem, assume inputs are correct\n    // compute\n    result = (B-1)/(A-1);\n    amari = (B-1) % (A-1);\n    if (amari !=0) {\n        result++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait I can also replace the if with using the ceiling formula. But the code's logic is straightforward. \n\nWait, another way to compute the ceiling of (B-1)/(A-1) without using modulo is to do:\n\nresult = ((B-1) + (A-2)) / (A-1); \n\nBecause when you add (divisor -1) to the numerator before dividing, it effectively does ceiling division. But perhaps that's complicating it. Since the code uses both division and modulus, it's clearer as written.\n\nSo the translated code in C should be like the above.\n\nLet me write the final code step by step.\n\nMake sure to include stdio.h for input and output functions. Also, in C, the main function should return an int.\n\nWait the original Java code closes scanner and flushes. In C, we don't have to worry about that because when you exit, the printf buffer is flushed. But using printf and then return is okay.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe C code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n    int result = (B - 1) / (A - 1);\n    int amari = (B - 1) % (A - 1);\n    if (amari != 0) {\n        result += 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait wait, but in variable declaration in C, the variables have to be declared at the top.\n\nWait the code above declares 'result' and 'amari' after the scanf. So that would be invalid in C89 (which requires all variables to be declared at the start of a block). However, in C99 and later, variables can be declared closer to their use. But if the problem requires code to be compatible with older C standards, such as C89, that's a problem.\n\nBut given that in programming competitions, C99 is generally acceptable. But perhaps it's better to be safe by moving their declarations to the top.\n\nWait the code above has after 'scanf' a declaration for 'result' and 'amari', which in C89 syntax would be an error, because variable declarations must come before any statements in the block. So in the code as written above, the code would have:\n\nAfter the A and B variables, we have a line:\n\nint result ...\n\nThat's allowed only if it's in the same block before any statements.\n\nWait the code's structure is:\n\n{\n   int A, B; // ok\n   scanf(...) // first statement here.\n\n   int result // this is a declaration after a statement, which is invalid in C89.\n\nSo for compatibility, the variables should be declared at the top.\n\nSo let's rewrite:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B, result, amari;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n    result = (B - 1)/(A -1);\n    amari = (B-1) % (A -1);\n    if (amari !=0) {\n        result++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThat way, all variables are declared at the top. Alternatively, group the declarations:\n\nint A,B;\nint result, amari;\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, can also do:\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B;\n    int result, amari;\n    ...\n}\n\nEither way, that would be better for C89 compatibility.\n\nAlternatively, if the code uses mid-statements variable declarations, but since that's C99, perhaps it's okay, but better to follow the most compatible.\n\nHence the code should have all variables declared at the start of the block.\n\nLooking back to original Java code, variables are declared before use, so that's fine. The translated code should follow that pattern.\n\nSo the corrected C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B, result, amari;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n    result = (B - 1)/(A -1);\n    amari = (B -1) % (A -1);\n    if (amari != 0) {\n        result += 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in some cases when B-1 is negative? But given the constraints of AtCoder's problem, perhaps A and B are positive integers where A >= 2, so (A-1) is positive, and B is >= something so that B-1 is non-negative. For example, the problem must have B greater than or equal to A perhaps. But the code doesn't check that, so I don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, division of integers is truncating towards zero. C does the same. So in both, (B-1)/(A-1) is same as Java.\n\nTesting for edge cases:\n\nLet me test when B=1, but if A is not 1, but according to problem likely B can't be 1 if A>1? Not sure, but assuming the code proceeds.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=3: B-1=2, A-1=1. (2/1=2. Remainder 0. So result=2. But let's see the code.\n\nOriginal Java code's calculation: (3-1)/(2-1) =2, amari 0, so result remains 2. But according to the problem, what is the intended logic?\n\nAlternatively, let me take the sample inputs from the problem (ABC139 B: Hard or Easy (easy problem?), but perhaps I can reason.\n\nThe problem is probably like: given apples A, B, the problem is to determine how many days until B apples are obtained, where each day after the first, you can plant a tree with the rate increasing by 1 each day.\n\nWait I think the problem was about how many days to get at least B apples, given that each day the apples harvested increases by A-1. Wait not sure, but the code must be correct.\n\nSuppose the code is correct, then the translation's logic should be correct as per the Java code.\n\nThus the C code above should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say A=3, B=5.\n\nThen (B-1) =4, (A-1)=2. 4/2 is 2. So result=2. Since amari is 0, output is 2.\n\nAnother example: A=3, B=6: B-1 is 5. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 1. So result is 2+1=3. Checking:\n\nAt the end of day 1: 1 (since first day gets 1 apple? Maybe. Assuming the code's formula is correct.)\n\nWait perhaps the formula is derived from some mathematical approach. But regardless, the translation of the code is correct.\n\nSo the C code should be correct."
