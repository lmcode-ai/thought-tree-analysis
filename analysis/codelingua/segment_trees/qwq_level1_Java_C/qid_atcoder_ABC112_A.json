So the two numbers are each on their own lines. But in C, with this code, the two numbers can be on two lines, or on the same line. But according to problem's input specs, when N is 2, the next two lines are each the two numbers. So the C code should read two lines, but scanf doesn't care as long as it reads two integers. Alternatively, maybe use fgets to read entire lines and parse each line separately. Let me try that approach for better control. Something like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h> // for atoi?\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char line[256]; // Buffer to hold each line. // Read first line for n\n    if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1; // error handling.\n    n = atoi(line); // parse the first line to get n.\n\n    if(n == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Read next two lines for a and b.\n        // read a:\n        if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1;\n        int a = atoi(line);\n\n        if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1;\n        int b = atoi(line);\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} This approach uses fgets and atoi, which avoids any issues with input whitespace. Wait, but when they use atoi on the line, the newline character would be in the string. For example, if the user enters '5\\n' into the first line. The fgets will include the newline, so the string is \"5\\n\" (with the null terminator after). The atoi would stop at the '5' and ignore the newline, so it's okay.",

Wait another thing: in the code, when using fgets and then atoi:\n\nfgets(line, 256, stdin) reads a line, up to 255 chars plus null. Then, line can have trailing newlines. To ensure that atoi works, but it's okay since atoi stops at non-digit chars. So the code is okay. Testing with N=1, then after reading the first line, it prints. For N=2, then reads two lines, each has an integer, adds them. This should work. Thus, I think this is the correct C code.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into C. Let's see what the Java code is doing first. \n\nThe main function starts by reading an integer n. If n is 1, it prints \"Hello World\". Otherwise, it reads two more integers, adds them, and prints the sum. \n\nThe read method in Java reads 'len' lines from standard input and returns them as an array of strings. Then there's a close method to close the BufferedReader.\n\nHmm, translating this to C. Let's think. C doesn't have classes or objects here, so the code structure will be different. The main function will be the entry point.\n\nFirst, how to handle input in C. The standard way is to use functions like scanf or fgets. Since we need to read lines, maybe fgets is better to avoid issues with whitespace, but for this problem, perhaps scanf can suffice.\n\nThe Java code's read function reads 'len' lines. Let's see the cases:\n\nIn the main function:\n\nWhen n is 1, it just reads 1 line, but actually, looking closer, when n is 1, the code reads 1 value (n itself comes from the first read). Wait, no. Let's check the Java code again. The main code's first line is: int n = Integer.parseInt(read(1)[0]); So read(1) reads one line, which is the input for n. Then, if n is not 1, it calls read(2) to get two numbers to add.\n\nSo the input structure is:\n\nFirst input line is n (either 1 or 2? Wait wait, the problem. The problem is from AtCoder's ABC112 A. Oh right, that problem says: \"You will be given an integer N. If N is 1, output 'Hello World'; if N is 2, output the sum of two integers a and b given in the next line.\" Wait maybe the problem's input for n being 2 requires two numbers on separate lines? Wait looking at the Java code:\n\nWait in the Java code, when n is 1, they read read(1) (so first line is n, then when n=1, that's it. But when n is not 1 (so n=2 per the problem's detail), then they read two lines via read(2). So the input structure is:\n\nInput line 1: N.\n\nIf N is 1, output \"Hello World\".\n\nIf N is 2, then next two lines are a and b, sum and print.\n\nWait, but the code in Java's else clause: read(2) would read two lines, then parses those two into integers and adds them. So the input for case 2 is two lines. So the problem expects:\n\nWhen N is 2, two numbers given on two separate lines.\n\nSo in C, the code will need to read the first line as N, then:\n\nif N ==1, printf \"Hello World\"\n\nelse (assuming N ==2, because that's the problem's case), read two lines, each containing an integer, add and print.\n\nNow, in C, to read the first input (N). The user can input that via scanf(\"%d\", &n). But if it's a line with only one number, then scanf would work. But for other cases, like the numbers for a and b, again, same approach?\n\nWait, but in C, when using scanf, after entering a number, the user presses enter, so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, but maybe the numbers could be on separate lines, for the two numbers when N is 2. So for input a and b on separate lines, using scanf twice would work. So the plan is:\n\nRead N via scanf.\n\nCheck N:\n\nIf 1, print \"Hello World\"\n\nElse (2?), read a and b with scanf and print their sum.\n\nBut then, the code can be straightforward. Let me see the Java code's structure.\n\nWait the Java code's read function is a helper method that takes an int len, reads len lines and returns them as a string array. So in the read method, they read len lines using br.readLine() in a loop.\n\nIn C, we can have a similar helper function, but since there's no objects, it can be a function that reads 'n' lines and returns an array of strings, then we can process them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can code it inline since in C, functions can't return arrays like that easily. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor parsing the input:\n\nFirst, reading N. Then, when N is 2, read two lines, each containing an integer.\n\nThe C code could start with:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &n) != 1) {\n        // error handling? Maybe just assume inputs are correct as per problem statements.\n    }\n\n    if (n ==1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        int a, b;\n        if (scanf(\"%d\", &a) !=1 || scanf(\"%d\", &b)!=1) {\n            // error handling, but maybe problem ensures valid input\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but wait\u2014the second and third lines (when N is 2) could be read in separate calls, but perhaps they are on separate lines. Since scanf reads whitespace-separated numbers, it can read from the buffer, but the inputs might be on separate lines.\n\nWait, for example, after the first input (n=2), the user might type the first number on the next line, (hitting enter) then second number on another line. The scanf for a would read the first number on the next line, then the next scanf for b would read the following line. That's okay. So this code would work.\n\nWait but in the code above, after reading N with scanf, the next two lines are read via two scanf calls. So for the two numbers, they can be on separate lines or on the same line. But according to the problem's input specification, when N is 2, perhaps they are on two separate lines. But in C, using two separate scanf calls will handle that because after the first number is read, the second scanf will wait for the next input line.\n\nWait, but if the user enters both numbers in the same line, after the first input, then the first scanf would read the first one, and the second would read the second, which is okay. The problem's exact input method?\n\nWait looking back to the original Java code's read function. The read(1) reads one line (using br.readLine() each time). So when the Java code calls read(2), it is getting two lines. \n\nSo in this Java code, when N is 2, the two numbers must be on two separate lines. So in C's scanf, when N is 2, the code needs to read two lines each with a single number. But how does the current approach handle that?\n\nSuppose user enters the two numbers on two lines:\n\nFirst input line: 2\n\nSecond line: 5\n\nThird line: 3\n\nThen, first scanf for a reads 5, then next scanf for b reads 3. That's correct. The sum is 8.\n\nIf they put both a and b on the second line (like '5 3'), then the second scanf would get 5 for a, then the next scanf (for b) would read 3 from that same line, which is also fine. However the problem's input for N=2 requires two lines, each with the numbers? Let me check the problem statement. Since the Java code uses read(2) which reads two lines, that's the case. \n\nTherefore, in the problem, when N is 2, the next two lines are the two numbers. So in C, the code's approach via two scanf statements for a and b would work. Because after the first (N=2), the first scanf for a would read the next line, then the next scanf for b would read the third line.\n\nHowever in C's scanf, the %d format will skip any whitespace (including newlines, spaces, etc) and read the next integer. So if the two numbers are on separate lines, that's okay. The first scanf for 'a' would read the first integer from the next line, then the second scanf for 'b' would read the next integer from the following line. But when using scanf in that way, the newline between them isn't an issue. So the code would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to read each as a line, but that complicates things. Since the code needs to read an integer as per the problem's input.\n\nThus, the C code could be written as straightforward as that.\n\nBut let's look at the original code's read function. It did use readLines, so in case the user inputs the two numbers each on separate lines.\n\nHence, the code in C would work as above.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the 'read(2)' would return an array of two strings, each being the entire line. So those lines could be read, parsed as integers.\n\nTherefore, the C code needs to read two separate lines.\n\nWait, but using scanf, the code may not read the entire line, but just the number. If there's any leading whitespace, it's okay. The problem probably ensures the inputs are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in C, better to read a line at a time, to handle leading or trailing spaces that could be tricky for scanf.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach in C would be to read each line with fgets, then parse with sscanf.\n\nBut let's think: first approach is perhaps sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, here's a more detailed version:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &n) != 1) {\n        return 1; // error, but assuming input is correct.\n    }\n\n    if (n == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        int a, b;\n        if(scanf(\"%d\", &a) !=1 || scanf(\"%d\", &b)!=1)\n        {\n            // handle error\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in this code, after the first scanf for n, the next line would be read by first scanf for a, then the third line by next scanf. Hmm.\n\nWait the first scanf for n would read the first line's integer. Then the first scanf for a reads the next input. Suppose the next input is the entire second line, but in the Java code, read(2) gives two lines, each stored as a string. So the two numbers are each on their own lines.\n\nBut in C, with this code, the two numbers can be on two lines, or on the same line. But according to problem's input specs, when N is 2, the next two lines are each the two numbers. So the C code should read two lines, but scanf doesn't care as long as it reads two integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use fgets to read entire lines and parse each line separately.\n\nLet me try that approach for better control.\n\nSomething like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h> // for atoi?\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char line[256]; // Buffer to hold each line.\n    \n    // Read first line for n\n    if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1; // error handling.\n    n = atoi(line); // parse the first line to get n.\n\n    if(n == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Read next two lines for a and b.\n        // read a:\n        if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1;\n        int a = atoi(line);\n\n        if (!fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)) return 1;\n        int b = atoi(line);\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis approach uses fgets and atoi, which avoids any issues with input whitespace.\n\nWait, but when they use atoi on the line, the newline character would be in the string. For example, if the user enters '5\\n' into the first line. The fgets will include the newline, so the string is \"5\\n\" (with the null terminator after). The atoi would stop at the '5' and ignore the newline, so it's okay.\n\nThis approach ensures that each number is read line by line. So even if there's leading or trailing whitespace in the lines (like a space after the number), the atoi would read the first part.\n\nThis might be better because the original Java code uses readLine(), which reads entire lines. Thus, in C, matching that behavior is better to handle all cases properly.\n\nTherefore, this approach is safer.\n\nNow, that seems better. So the code would look like:\n\nBut in the Java code, the 'read' function is part of the helper. The C version can do the same for the helper, but since it's a simple case, perhaps inline is fine.\n\nWait. The code I wrote uses fgets three times: once for n, then two times for a and b. Exactly like the Java code's read(1) for n, then read(2) for a and b.\n\nSo this approach should handle the same input correctly.\n\nHence, this is the right way.\n\nSo putting it all together, here's the C code.\n\nBut in the code, the problem may have additional considerations.\n\nWait, also, in the Java code, there's a closing method which closes the BufferedReader. But in C, the stdin is automatically closed at the end, so no need.\n\nNow, for the code, the first approach using fgets would be better.\n\nWait another thing: in the code, when using fgets and then atoi:\n\nfgets(line, 256, stdin) reads a line, up to 255 chars plus null.\n\nThen, line can have trailing newlines. To ensure that atoi works, but it's okay since atoi stops at non-digit chars.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nTesting with N=1, then after reading the first line, it prints.\n\nFor N=2, then reads two lines, each has an integer, adds them.\n\nThis should work.\n\nThus, I think this is the correct C code.\n\nSo the final code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[256];\n    int n;\n\n    // Read first line for n\n    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) {\n        return 1; // error case\n    }\n    n = atoi(buffer);\n\n    if (n == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Read two numbers\n        int a, b;\n        if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        a = atoi(buffer);\n\n        if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        b = atoi(buffer);\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in C, if the first read returns null, it might be an error, but the problem might guarantee correct input.\n\nIn programming contest settings, code often doesn't check for input errors, so maybe the code can omit those return 1 cases.\n\nAlternatively, in the Code Golf manner.\n\nBut the question is to translate the Java code accurately. The Java code's read function had try/catch for IOException but wasn't handling it (empty catch block). Similarly, perhaps the C code also doesn't handle errors, as the Java original didn't.\n\nBut in the Java code's read function, they just catch the exception but don't do anything, so leaving the code's error handling as minimal in C.\n\nSo in C code, perhaps you can just assume the inputs are correct, and proceed without checking the return value of fgets?\n\nProbably acceptable for the problem's sake.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[256];\n    int n;\n\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n    n = atoi(buffer);\n\n    if(n ==1 ){\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n        int a = atoi(buffer);\n        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n        int b = atoi(buffer);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis is simpler, without error checks, just like the original code.\n\nAlternatively, using scanf as in the earlier example would also work. Let's see which is better.\n\nBut the main thing is to mirror the original code's approach.\n\nThe original code used BufferedReader.readLine each time. The read function in Java reads 'len' lines, each line stored as elements. Hence, the equivalent in C would read lines one by one, so better to use fgets approach.\n\nHence I think the C code using fgets is more accurate to the original code.\n\nWait the original Java 'read' function reads 'len' lines. Let's confirm with the example.\n\nOriginal read(2) returns two strings each being a line read via readLine, so equivalent to three fgets in C for n=2: first the n line, then two more for a and b.\n\nSo the C code using fgets is more precise, yes.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in Java's code when using Integer.parseInt(strs[0]) so even if the numbers had any leading or trailing spaces in the input lines, they are parsed as integers correctly. Similarly, with atoi in C, leading whitespace would be ignored, so it's okay.\n\nThus, the code I have above should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the buffer size. If the input has a line longer than 255 characters, then it will be truncated. But for programming problems, typically the numbers are not that big in terms of character length. So assuming the problem's inputs are within the limits.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use malloc for buffer, but it's more complicated.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[256];\n    int n;\n\n    // Read N\n    if (fgets(buffer, 256, stdin) == NULL) return 1;\n    n = atoi(buffer);\n\n    if(n == 1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n        int a, b; // Assuming N is 2\n        if (fgets(buffer, 256, stdin) == NULL) return 1;\n        a = atoi(buffer);\n        if (fgets(buffer, 256, stdin) == NULL) return 1;\n        b = atoi(buffer);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis includes the error checks, but even if not needed, the problem may not care. However, the original Java code's read did have a try-catch, so maybe error checking is better. But since in C you can't crash, perhaps adding returns. But for code submission in programming contests, maybe error checking can be omitted, so perhaps the minimal code.\n\nAlternatively, if the user inputs a non-empty line, that's fine. Let me see.\n\nThe original code didn't have any error handling except a useless catch clause, so omitting error handling in the C code is okay.\n\nThus, the C code can proceed as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[256];\n    int n;\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n    n = atoi(buffer);\n\n    if(n ==1 ){\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    } else {\n        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n        int a = atoi(buffer);\n        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n        int b = atoi(buffer);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, the code could use scanf for n and then for the two numbers. Let's see:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    if(scanf(\"%d\", &n)!=1) return 1;\n\n    if(n ==1) {\n        printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n        int a, b;\n        if( scanf(\"%d\", &a)!=1 || scanf(\"%d\", &b)!=1 ) return 1;\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a + b);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nDoes this also work?\n\nYes, if the input is entered such that after N=2, the two numbers are on two separate lines, then the first scanf for a would read the first number (from the next line), then next scanf reads the second number. But if the user enters both numbers on the same line as after N=2, then that would also be okay, since they would be parsed in sequence, leading to a and b being correctly read. \n\nHence this approach also works, perhaps more efficient, and uses fewer lines of code.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nWell, the original code uses multiple read lines (read(1), then read(2)), which is per-line, so fgets is more accurate. But since in code submission, both approaches are valid and will pass the test cases, either could be acceptable.\n\nThe problem requires to translate the code, so perhaps to follow the original code's logic as closely as possible.\n\nOriginal code:\n\n-read(1) reads 1 line (the first line for N)\n\n-if n is 1, done.\n\nElse, read 2 lines, each line for a and b.\n\nThus, the code must read three lines when n is 2. The fscanf approach would also read exactly two lines? Or wait when you have scanf for a and b in sequence.\n\nWait, for the first case after N=2, the first scanf(\"%d\", &a) will read the first integer from the next line. Suppose that line only has the integer, then next scanf will read from the following line. So two lines are read, as per original code.\n\nTherefore, in that case, the scanf approach also works. \n\nAlternatively, if the two numbers are on the same line after N=2:\n\nlike input:\n\n2 \n\n5 6 \n\nthen the first scanf reads 5 into a, and the next scanf will read 6 as b. \n\nHence the code will still sum correctly. Thus, the scanf approach works. However, according to the original code's flow (which reads two lines when n is 2), the two numbers are read in two separate lines.\n\nBut the problem's requirement when n is 2 might be either way, but since in code submission, both approaches would pass the test cases.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"when N is 2, output the sum of two integers a and b given in the next line.\" Wait wait, perhaps the problem states that the two numbers are on the next line separated by spaces?\n\nWait looking back to the actual problem ABC112, A problem:\n\nAccording to the problem statement for ABC112_A:\n\nProblem Statement\n\nYou will be given an integer N. If N is 1, output ``Hello World``; if N is 2, output the sum of two integers a and b given in the input.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 2\n\n-1000 \u2264 a,b \u2264 1000\n\nInput\n\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\nN\n\nIf N is 2, the second line will contain two integers a and b.\n\nAh okay, the two integers are on the same line. So the two numbers are provided on a single line.\n\nThen original code is different. Oh, that's a problem!\n\nAh! The original Java code in the problem is supposed to handle when N=2, the next two lines are each for a and b, but according to the actual problem's input, when N=2, the input has the two numbers on one line. So the Java code as presented may have a bug, but since the user provided code is that Java code, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait this is key. So we need to adapt to the original code's behavior or to the problem's correct spec?\n\nThe user says: \"You are a code translation expert. Translate the Java code below to C\".\n\nSo I have to translate the provided Java code into C, not worry whether the Java code is correct or corresponds to the problem's actual requirements.\n\nHence, the provided Java code for the problem may have a mistake because for N=2 in the actual problem's input, the two numbers are on one line, not two lines. But the user provided Java code may emit an incorrect solution, but we're to translate it as-is.\n\nWait in the user's Java code's code for case n is not 1 (i.e. n is 2), it calls read(2). The read function takes 'len' and returns a string array of size 'len', each being a line read.\n\nThus, when called for len=2, read(2), the code reads two lines. Each of those two lines becomes the two elements. Thus, the code expects that for N=2, the user enters two numbers on two separate lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is when N=2: the second line contains two integers a and b. Hence, the user's Java code may have a bug.\n\nBut given the problem's original code is what's provided, then we have to translate it exactly, assuming that it's correct as per the user's code.\n\nThus, the provided Java code is written that for N=2, two lines are input, each has a number. Therefore, in the translated C code, when N is 2, we must read two lines. So the C code, to mirror the Java code's behavior, uses the fgets approach where two lines are read for a and b.\n\nIf we used scanf for the a and b in the case of N=2, where the input is two numbers on the same line, the code would fail.\n\nThus, the C code translation must read two lines for a and b.\n\nHence, I need to translate that behavior.\n\nThus, the correct C code would use fgets to read two lines, each for a and b's values, in case of N=2. Thus, the code using fgets is the correct translation.\n\nTherefore, the code I wrote earlier using fgets is the right approach.\n\nThus, the final answer is the code with fgets.\n\nTesting with N=2 and the code's logic:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\nOutput:\n\nHello World\n\nAnother sample when N=2, with input lines:\n\n2\n\n5\n\n3\n\nThen the output is 8.\n\nWhich is correct per the code's logic.\n\nAlternatively, if the code was for N=2 expecting two numbers on one line, the Java code would not work. But we have to go by the provided code.\n\nThus, the correct C code uses the fgets approach."
