Hmm, C doesn't have built-in methods like split, so I'll need to handle string splitting manually. Let's think about how to read input in C. Maybe using fgets to read a line, then parse it.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me first understand what the Java code does. So the code reads input from the user, splits it into an array of strings using space as a delimiter, then counts how many elements are there until it hits a \"0\". It then prints that count.\n\nHmm, C doesn't have built-in methods like split, so I'll need to handle string splitting manually. Let's think about how to read input in C. Maybe using fgets to read a line, then parse it. The count is incremented for each element until a \"0\" is found.\n\nFirst, I need to include necessary headers: stdio.h for input/output functions. Then, the main function. \n\nStart by reading the input line. Let's allocate a buffer, maybe 1024 characters to be safe. Use fgets to get the input. Then split the string into tokens using strtok, splitting on spaces. Each token is a string. \n\nLoop through each token, increment the result each time. If the token is \"0\", break. Wait, but in C, comparing strings with == won't work. Need to use strcmp. So if strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0, then break.\n\nWait, but the elements in the input are numbers. So when the user enters \"0\", the token should be \"0\", so that comparison is correct.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the entire line into a buffer.\n2. Split into tokens using space as delimiter.\n3. For each token, check if it's \"0\". If yes, break.\n4. Increment the count until then.\n5. Print the count.\n\nPotential issues: leading/trailing spaces? The Java code uses split(\" \"), which splits on any space. So in C, strtok with \" \" as the delimiter should do, but maybe it's better to split on whitespace. Wait, the split in Java's case with \" \" might split on one space, but perhaps in practice splits on any whitespace. But for the problem, probably the test cases have numbers separated by single spaces. So using strtok with \" \" should work.\n\nWait, but the strtok function in C uses the delimiters to split the string into tokens. So if we pass \" \" as the delimiter, it will split on space characters. \n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nIn main:\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[1024];\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n    // then split into tokens\n    char *token = strtok(buffer, \" \");\n    int result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) break;\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but wait a second. Suppose the input is \"1 2 0 3 4\". The Java code would process each element until it hits \"0\", so counts 3 (the first three elements 1,2,0?), but wait in the Java code, it's adding 1 for each string in input_array. Let me check the Java code again. \n\nThe Java code:\n\nfor each String str in input_array:\n    result +=1\n    if str is \"0\", break.\n\nSo if the input is \"1 0\", the loop runs for \"1\" (result becomes 1), then \"0\" (adds 1 again making result 2, then breaks. So the total is 2? But in the C code I proposed, when the current token is \"0\", it increments and breaks. Let's see:\n\nFor the token \"0\" in the loop, result is increased before checking? Let's see the code structure in Java:\n\nThey add to result first, then check if the current str is 0. So in the case when the element is \"0\", it still adds the count, then breaks. So in the example where input is \"0\" (only one element), the result would be 1. \n\nIn my C code above, the code does the same: increments result first, then checks. That's correct.\n\nSo the C code needs to exactly mirror that: increment before checking. So in the C loop:\n\nresult is incremented, then compare the token. So the while loop structure is okay.\n\nWait in the code I wrote earlier:\n\nfor each token loop:\n\nresult++ comes first, then check if the token is \"0\", break.\n\nWait the structure is:\n\ninside the loop:\n\nresult++ \n\nthen check if token is \"0\", break.\n\nBut the loop is while (token is not null, but we have to process each token. Wait the loop is:\n\ntoken starts as the first token.\n\nenter loop: add to count.\n\nthen check if the token is \"0\". If so, break. So the next iteration doesn't happen.\n\nWait, but the next step after processing this token is to break, so the loop ends.\n\nWait for example in \"1 0\":\n\nFirst token is \"1\"\n\nresult becomes 1 (after increment from 0).\n\nSince it's not 0, continue loop.\n\nthen call strtok for next, then the next token is \"0\".\n\nenter loop again:\n\nresult becomes 2.\n\ncheck: token \"0\", so break. The loop exits.\n\nThus, the code gives 2, which matches the Java code. That's correct.\n\nAnother example, input \"0\" gives:\n\nFirst token is \"0\". \n\nresult increments to 1, check the token, so break. So output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the C code logic is correct.\n\nNow, handling the buffer size: what if the input is longer than 1024? Maybe better to use a larger buffer, but in programming contest scenarios, perhaps the problem constraints have small input sizes. Since in the original problem, ABC170A (assuming it's from AtCoder), so the problem probably has small inputs, like up to maybe 100 numbers? So 1024 should be okay.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a buffer of like 10000 or something. But for the code, I can set 1024 and go with it.\n\nAnother thing: the input might have a trailing newline. But fgets leaves that, but when using strtok with \" \", it would split correctly.\n\nWait, for example, if the input is \"1 2 3\", then buffer includes that plus \\n, but the token \"1\\n\" no, because strtok splits on spaces, so the \\n is left but not part of the token. Wait the \\n is part of the buffer, but in the first token, strtok splits on the first space, so \"1\" is first, then the rest after space. The newline is part of the rest, but then the next split would take 2 as next token, then 3 as last token. Wait no: the input is like \"1 2 3\\n\", so the string is stored in buffer as '1', ' ', '2', ' ', '3', '\\n', '\\0'\n\nstrtok(buffer,\" \") will first return \"1\", then strtok again returns \"2\", then \"3\", then \"\\n\" ?\n\nAh right. So in the case where a line ends with something that's not a number, but in the problem, maybe the input is just numbers separated by spaces, and the 0 terminates. \n\nWait the code in Java's split(\" \") splits on spaces, which divides the line into parts by each space. So if the line has trailing spaces, the last element might be an empty string, but in the problem, probably the input consists of space-separated integers (strings), ending with a 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the input is a list of numbers separated by spaces, and the first 0 encountered stops counting. So when the code processes the tokens, even if there is a trailing space (like, \"1 0  \" followed by newline), then the next tokens would be \"\", but since we check for \"0\", after the 0, the code breaks. Wait in this scenario, after the 0, the next token is empty string (if the trail after 0 is space), but since we broke after the 0, it's okay.\n\nSo the code would correctly stop at 0.\n\nPotential problem when the token is \"0 \" (with a space?), no, because strtok splits on space. The token would be \"0\".\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother thing: in C, the string can be split, but when using strtok, it modifies the original string, inserting \\0 at the split positions. Since we read the input into a buffer, which is on the stack, that's okay.\n\nNow, let's code it step by step.\n\nIncluding headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[1024];\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n    char *token = strtok(buffer, \" \");\n    int result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0)\n            break;\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but wait! Wait in the code, if the first token is \"0\", it increments to 1 and breaks. That's correct.\n\nTesting some cases.\n\nTest case 1: Input \"0\" \u2192 output 1.\n\nTest case 2: Input \"1 2 0 3\" \u2192 counts 1,2,0 (so three elements, but result increments to 3: Wait:\n\nWait original Java code counts each element until it hits a \"0\".\n\nWait in the Java code 'result +=1' is done before the if. So in that input \"1 2 0 3\":\n\nThe array has elements [\"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\"]. The loop runs through each until \"0\" is found. \n\nThe first element \"1\": result becomes 1.\n\nSecond \"2\": 2.\n\nThird \"0\": 3, then breaks. So output is 3.\n\nThe C code would do:\n\ntoken is first \"1\" \u2192 result 1, not 0 \u2192 proceed. Next token \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 [next line?]\n\nWait in the C code's loop:\n\nThe first token is \"1\":\n\nresult becomes 1, not 0 \u2192 loop continues.\n\nThen token becomes next via strtok.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nNow, next token is \"2\":\n\nresult increments to 2, not 0 \u2192 loop continues, get next token: \"0\".\n\nThen:\n\nresult becomes 3 \u2192 check: token is \"0\" \u2192 break. So loop stops, result is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case. Input \"5 4 3 2 1 0\" \u2192 count is 6? Wait no.\n\nWait the elements are 5,4,3,2,1,0. The Java code would add 1 for each, but when the \"0\" is encountered (the last element), it adds first, then breaks. So total 6. The C code does the same.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: \"0 1 2\". The code reads first token \"0\": increments to 1, then breaks. So output is 1, which is correct.\n\nEdge case: empty input? Well, according to problem constraints, probably inputs are valid. \n\nWhat if input has leading or trailing spaces? Like \"  1 2 0 \" \u2192 the first token would be \"\", after the leading space?\n\nWait, let's see. For input \"  1 2 0 \", the buffer would be \"  1 2 0 \\n\".\n\nUsing strtok with \" \" as delimiter, the first token is \"\"? Let's see.\n\nThe first call to strtok(buffer, \" \"). The delimiter is any ' ' characters. So the first token is (starting from beginning) after skipping leading ' 's:\n\nthe first token is the first non-space, so \"1\", then next space, then between 1 and 2 is a single space, etc. The trailing space and newline would produce an extra token \"0\" followed by \"\" from the final spaces.\n\nBut in the code, the loop will process \"1\", which is okay, then \"2\", then \"0\". The next token after \"0\" would be the trailing whitespace (the spaces after 0), which would cause strtok to return \"\", which would be considered as a token. \n\nWait in the case of input \"0  \", then the first token is \"0\", which gives count 1, then the next token is \"\" (since after \"0\" there are spaces), which would have been picked up by strtok. \n\nIn which case, the next token after \"0\" would be \"\", so the loop would process that? Wait no, the loop proceeds. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input \"0  \".\n\nfgets gets \"0  \\n\". \n\nFirst token is \"0\".\n\nInside loop:\n\nresult is 1. Breaks out of loop. So the \"\" token isn't processed. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario where trailing spaces after 0:\n\n\"1 0  \" \u2192 tokens are \"1\", \"0\", \"\" \u2192 the third token is \"\".\n\nAfter processing \"0\": the code increments the count to 2, breaks. \n\nThus the output is correct.\n\nAnother scenario, input \"  0  \": the first token is \"0\" \u2192 count 1, correct.\n\nBut if input is \"00\", which is not a 0 but \"00\" \u2192 but the code would count it as not zero, but only when the string is exactly \"0\".\n\nThus the code is correct, as per the original Java code which compares the string exactly to \"0\".\n\nTherefore, the C code seems correct.\n\nWait in the Java code, the split is done on \" \", which in Java's split is a regular expression. The split(\" \") would split on single spaces. So multiple spaces would result in empty strings as elements. But in C using strtok with \" \" would split on any space (but by default, it splits on each occurrence). Wait no: strtok with the delimiter being \" \" is a single space, so multiple spaces would give empty tokens. Hmm, so if the input has multiple spaces between numbers, like \"1  2 0\", which has two spaces between 1 and 2 \u2192 in Java's split(\" \"), that would split into [\"1\", \"\", \"2\", \"0\"], right? Because split by the space. \n\nIn that case, the Java code would increment for the empty string as well. So in such a case, the code counts \"1\", \"\", \"2\", \"0\". Each of these are elements in the array. So the code would process \"\" as a non-zero string (since it's empty) \u2192 increments, then process \"0\" \u2192 then the result would be 4? Because the for-each would iterate over all elements until 0.\n\nWait in the input \"1  2 0\":\n\nThe split would result in elements [\"1\", \"\", \"2\", \"0\".\n\nSo the loop would process each string:\n\nFirst \"1\" \u2192 count 1.\n\nSecond \"\" \u2192 count 2.\n\nThird \"2\" \u2192 3.\n\nFourth \"0\" \u2192 4, then breaks. So total 4.\n\nIn the C code's way with strtok using \" \" as the delimiter, the tokens would be \"1\" (from the first space), then \"\" (from the next spaces), then \"2\", then \"0\", then \"\" (if any). This would also count similarly. So in this case, the C code would also give 4, which matches.\n\nSo the code handles multiple spaces okay.\n\nBut what if the input has a string with leading zeros like \"01\"? Then in Java code, it would treat it as \"01\" which is not equal to \"0\", so it would count it as a non-zero element. The C code would do the same. Which matches.\n\nThus the C code is correct.\n\nI think that's all. The code should be as written."
