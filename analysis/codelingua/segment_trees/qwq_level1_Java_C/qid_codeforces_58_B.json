Hmm, but perhaps the user intends for the output to have all numbers on a single line? Let me check the problem again. But the problem might be from Codeforces, in problem B58 (probably Codeforces Round 58 or something), but I don't need the problem details; just translate the code accurately. So need to keep the output structure exactly as it was in the Java code. So in C, how to do that? Let's think step by step. First, include necessary headers. Since we are using standard input/output, we need `<stdio.h>`. Also, for getting integer input, `scanf` is sufficient. The main function in C should be `int main()` and return 0 at the end, possibly. Let's start:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    printf(\"%d \", n); // note, no new line here yet? Wait no, original code after printing n, uses println, which appends a new line. So the Java code does:\n\n    System.out.println(n + \" \"); --> which outputs \"n \" plus a new line. So in C, we can do:\n\n    printf(\"%d \\n\", n); ? Alternatively the original code does:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWhich effectively does n + \" \", making a string like \"5 \", then printing it, adding a new line. So in the Java code, that first line after printing \"5 \" will go to a new line. Wait, so the first line's printf in C would be:\n\nprintf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n\nThen the loop:\n\nint m = n;\nfor (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) { if (m % i ==0) {\n        printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n        m =i;\n    }\n} So that's the first approach. Wait, but in C, the for loop's variable declaration must be in the loop: for (int i = ...). That's valid in C99 standards. If the user's compiler is older, it might need to declare i outside, but let's assume it uses C99. Wait, in the Java code, after the first printing of n, the loop starts at i =n-1. Yes. So, translation steps:\n\nRead n. Print it followed by a space and newline. Then loop from i down. Wait in the C code, when we print the first \"n\", it's done via printf(\"%d \", n); but that would leave the newline? Wait let me think again: because the Java code used println, which adds the new line. So the first print is \"n \" followed by [new line], so in C, the printf should be \"%d \\n\". Yes, so:\n\nprintf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n\nSimilarly, the if block does the same with System.out.println(i + \" \"); which would be the same as printing \"%d \\n\" in C.\n\nThus, the C code would be structured as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    printf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n    int m =n;\n    for(int i =n-1; i > 0; i--) {\n        if(m % i ==0) {\n            printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n            m =i;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n} But wait, in Java, when you do %d, in printf or in division?",

The modulus in C works the same as Java there.\n\nWait about the modulus operator, same behavior for positive integers. So the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me test case. For example, if input is 4:\n\nIn Java code, after printing 4 followed by space and a newline. Then checking i=3:\n\nm is 4. 4%3 is 1, so no. Then i=2: 4 mod2=0, so print 2, followed by a space and newline? Then m becomes 2.\n\nThen i=1: check m mod 1, which is zero. So print 1 with ... a new line.\n\nWait so the output for input 4 would be:\n\n4 \n2 \n1 \n\nHmm, each number on their own line.\n\nAlternatively, the C code as written would do that, yes.\n\nWait maybe in Java code the print statement for the first time is outputting n followed by a space, then a newline, then each subsequent time, there is a space and new line.\n\nWait the output of the first line would be \"4 \", then a new line. The second \"2 \", new line, etc. So, the C code's code would have the same effect.\n\nTherefore, I think this code should work.\n\nWait but let me look closely at the code.\n\nWait, in Java's loop, it's for (int i =n-1 down to 1), so the loop runs i from n-1 down to 1.\n\nThe C code does the same with for(int i =n-1; i>0; i--).\n\nThen in the condition: if (m%i ==0), same as Java.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issue: What if the number n is 1. Then the loop starts at 0 and exits immediately because i>0. So the code would output 1 followed by a newline. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nJava code steps: prints 6 with space and new line.\n\nm =6.\n\nNext iteration i=5: 6 mod5 !=0, skipped.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2, no.\n\ni=3: 6 mod3=0 \u2192 print 3, and set m=3.\n\nThen i=2: check 3 mod2 \u21921, so no.\n\ni=1: 3 mod1=0 \u2192 print 1.\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nSo the C code would produce that.\n\nThus, the code looks correct.\n\nWait but when you print, the formatting in C is important. Let's check the Java's print statements again.\n\nJava's first line: System.out.println(n + \" \"). The string is made by appending \" \" to n, so the output is n followed by a space, then a new line.\n\nThe C code's first printf is using \"%d \\n\". Wait that is, the line would be \"n [space][newline]\" versus n followed by a space, then a newline. The same: the space is after the number, then the new line is separate. Yes, so that's the same as Java.\n\nWait, the %d would print the number, then a space, then a newline. Exactly as the Java code.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct."
