Alternatively, using malloc, but perhaps the OP expects the code to be in that style.

Wait, in the original Java code, the array is created as new int[N], so the C code can use a VLA (as allowed in C99 which most compilers support), so P could be defined as:\n\nint P[N]; \n\ninstead of dynamic allocation. Because using malloc messes up when N is 0 but that's impossible here. Alternatively, the code can use a VLA. So the malloc is unnecessary; better to just use an array. Let's re-do without it:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int P[N];\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int val;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &val);\n        P[i] = val -1;\n    }\n    // position array\n    int position[N];\n    for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {\n        position[P[i]] = i;\n    }\n    // process nglist\n    int nglist[N]; // max possible size is N-1 elements (if all out of order)\n    int nglist_size =0;\n    for(int i =0; i<N-1; ++i) {\n        int current_pos = position[i];\n        int next_pos = position[i+1];\n        if(current_pos > next_pos){\n            nglist[nglist_size] = i;\n            nglist_size++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (nglist_size ==0) {\n        printf(\"0\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    // compute answer\n    int a = N - nglist[0] -1;\n    int b = nglist[nglist_size -1] +1;\n    int ans= (a < b) ? a : b;\n    for(int i=0; i< nglist_size-1; ++i) {\n        int temp = (nglist[i]+1) + (N - nglist[i+1] -1); if( temp < ans ) ans = temp;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n} Hmm, yes. That's the C code. But need to make sure that the loops are correct. Also, the initial calculation for ans:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first part was:\n\nans = Math.min( N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(last index) +1 )",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see, I need to translate this Java code to C. Hmm, Java uses objects like HashMap and ArrayList, so in C, I have to find alternatives. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe code reads N integers, which form a permutation since P[i] is set to the input minus 1. Then it creates a map (in Java) to store the positions of elements. The map is later used to check which elements are out of order. The 'nglist' is a list of indices where P is decreasing. The rest calculates the minimum required moves, I think.\n\nTranslating this to C requires manually handling some structures. Let's think about steps:\n\n1. **Reading Input:** The main part is reading N, then an array of integers. In C, that's straightforward with scanf loops.\n2. **Storing Positions:** Instead of a HashMap, which maps the value (0-based) to their index in the permutation, in C I can just use an integer array. Because the values are from 0 to N-1 (since P[i] was input values -1). So an array 'position' of size N where position[p] = i. Because for each element in P, since they are unique (since it's a permutation), I can directly store the index.\n3. **Finding nglist:** This list contains the indices where P[i] is greater than P[i+1]. Wait, no. Wait, the code in Java loops i from 0 to N-2. Because for each element i (from 0 to N-2?), they check if map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). Wait, looking again:\n\nLet me parse the code again:\n\nThe nglist is filled by checking for each i from 0 to N-2, whether the position of 'i' is greater than the position of 'i+1'. Because in the permutation array P, P[i] is the value (after -1). Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, the P array is built from the input. The input is, for example, if the first number after N is 5, then P[0] is 5-1 =4? Or whatever the user inputs.\n\nAh, right. The P array holds the values input by the user minus 1, so presumably for a permutation from 0 to N-1.\n\nThe map is built by putting P[i] as the key (which is positions 0 to N-1) as the key, and the value is the index i. So when you call map.get(i) for some i value (like i from 0 to N-1?), that gives the index where that value is in the array P. \n\nWait, the loop for building the map is putting P[i] as the key, so the key is the element of the permutation (e.g., the values are from 0 to N-1, since it's a permutation), and the value stored in the map is the index in the array P where that element was found. \n\nSo when we check for map.get(i) > map.get(i+1), that is checking if the position of 'i' (element in P) is after the position of 'i+1'. Since in a sorted permutation, you want the element 0 at position 0, then element1 at position1, etc. So if element i is placed after element i+1, then when looking at their positions, the position for i is higher than for i+1. The nglist collects the 'i's where this is the case.\n\nWait, no, the nglist elements here are not the value's i's (the elements) but the positions in the permutation array? Wait, no, the loop is over i from 0 to N-1. Let me read the code again.\n\nWait, the nglist loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N-1; ++i) {\n    if (map.get(i) > map.get(i+1)) {\n        nglist.add(i);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, no. Because the 'i' here is from 0 to N-2 (since N-1 in the condition i < N-1 means last i is N-2). The inner condition is checking if the position of the element 'i' in P is located after the position of element 'i+1'. Because map.get(i) is the position where element i is in the array. If that position is larger than the position of element i+1, then that's a problem, since in the permutation, even when the elements are ordered, elements in order would have their indexes in order. Like, if you have the elements in order, say 0,1,2,...N-1, then their positions in the array would be in the order, so map.get(i) would be i. So in that case, the condition map.get(i) > map.get(i+1) would not occur, hence nglis is empty.\n\nSo when the permutation has some inverse pairs in the element ordering, then nglist contains the i values (from 0 to N-2) where this is true. Like, if the element 0 is at position 2 and element1 is at position1, then for i=0 (since that's the element we're considering), the position is 2 versus the position of element1 (which is 1). So map.get(0)=2, map.get(1)=1: 2>1, so nglist adds i=0 (the element i?), but the code is storing the 'i' here as the position in the elements, not the array's indices. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify variables:\n\nThe variable 'i' in the loop for nglist's iteration is actually the element that is being compared to the next element. So the condition is \"the position of element i is behind (higher index in the array) than the position of element i+1. So such a situation means that in the permutation sequence, element i comes after element i+1. Since in a sorted permutation, each element comes right before the next. So if that is violated, it's an inversion, part of the problem's \"NG\" indices?\n\nWait the name could be confusing here. The nglist is collecting all the elements i (ranges from 0 to N-2, the elements) where element i's position in the array P is after the position of element i+1. \n\nThe nglist thus represents the indices between elements i and i+1 where the permutation is incorrect (i.e they are out of order in terms of the element's natural sequence. So the presence of such terms means that the permutation is not sorted in increasing order.\n\nThe problem seems to be about finding the minimal number of swaps needed to make the permutation strictly increasing. Wait, maybe not, but in any case, the code then proceeds to calculate the answer based on these points.\n\nSo to translate this into C:\n\nStep 1: Read N from input, then read N integers into an array. Since the input values are stored into P[i] -1, so P[i] will be (input -1). \n\nBut in C, arrays are zero-based naturally. \n\nStep 2: Now, create a position array: since for each value v (from 0 to N-1), we can have an array of size N where position[v] = the index in P where this v appears.\n\nBecause since the permutation is a permutation of 0..N-1, every value from 0 to N-1 occurs exactly once. So the position array can be size N. \n\nThat's easier than a hashmap.\n\nSo to create this:\n\nInitialize an array of integers called position with size N.\n\nLoop over each index i from 0 to N-1:\n\n    int v = P[i];\n    position[v] = i;\n\nSo that's the equivalent of the maps.\n\nStep 3: Now, collect the 'nglist', which is a list of integers. Since ArrayList in java translates into a dynamic array, but in C, perhaps the easiest way is to preallocate space for the array. Since in the worst case, the nglist could have all possible elements except maybe one, i.e up to N-1 elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first find the number, then create an array of the required size. \n\nAlternatively in code:\n\nFirst, count the number of elements that are in the nglist.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's first process the input.\n\nFirst, in C, the code will have:\n\nint N;\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\nint P[N]; // declaring as dynamic array if allowed in C (but in C99 it's fine)\nfor (int i=0; i<N; ++i) {\n    int val;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &val);\n    P[i] = val -1; // because the Java code does '-1' here\n}\n\n// then create the position array:\n\nint position[N];\nfor (int i=0; i < N; i++) {\n   position[ P[i] ] = i;\n}\n\nThen nglist:\n\nWe can collect the list of ng's. Since we don't know the size, perhaps we can first count how many elements there are, then make an array.\n\nBut to avoid two loops, perhaps preallocate an array of size N, then track the actual count.\n\nLet's do:\n\nint nglist_size = 0;\n// allocate a maximum possible N elements (since max there are N-1 elements)\nint nglist[N];\n\n// loop from i=0 to N-2 (since i < N-1)\nfor (int i =0; i<N-1; ++i) {\n    int current_pos = position[i];\n    int next_pos = position[i+1];\n    // check if current's position is greater than next's\n    if (current_pos > next_pos) {\n        nglist[nglist_size] = i;\n        nglist_size++;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, if nglist_size is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow the variables in the code:\n\nThen in Java, the code calculates the answer as the minimum between:\n\nMath.min(N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(nglist.size()-1)+1 )\n\nWait, in the code, the first term is N minus (element at first nglist) minus 1?\n\nWait, the first nglist element is the first i where the positions are reversed. So the first element in nglist is the first element in the permutation's sequence that has an issue.\n\nWait, the terms are perhaps more about the indexes of the problematic elements. Let me get back to variables.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe initial ans is taking the minimum between:\n\n- (N - first NG position in the array? ):\n\nWait no: in the Java code, the variables are:\n\n// The first element is the first \"i\" (the element where the problem occurred?), so:\n\nThe ans is initialized as the minimum between (N - nglist.get(0) -1) and (nglist.get(last index)+1).\n\nWait the first term is (N - first NG's value -1) ?\n\nWait 'nglist.get(0)' is the first element in the list of 'i's where position[i] > position[i+1]. The first element i is e.g., if the problem starts at i=5 (as an example), then first term would be N -5 -1?\n\nWait not sure. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the NG list is [i1, i2, ... ik].\n\nThen the first term is N - (i1) - 1 ?\n\nWait the first term is N minus the first element of nglist minus 1?\n\nWait the code's first part:\n\nans = Math.min(N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(nglist.size() -1) + 1);\n\nWait the first argument is (N - (nglist[0]) - 1). \n\nWait, but in the code, the nglist elements are integers i where in the problem's check. \n\nWait the elements in the nglist are the i values where position[i] > position[i+1]. These i values are between 0 and N-2 (since the loop is up to N-2). \n\nThe first term N - i0 -1 would be like (N-1 - i0). Hmm, not sure what that represents. Maybe the distance from the first problematic position to the end?\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can think that the minimal swaps are determined based on the span between these problematic points. Let me not get too stuck here, since the code logic is to be translated, not resolved.\n\nThe next loop is: \n\nfor (int i=0; i < nglist.size()-1; ++i) { \n\nans = min between current ans and ( nglist[i]+1 + N - nglist[i+1] -1 ) \n\nWait:\n\nSo between the i-th and (i+1)th ng elements. Let me see:\n\nThe term is (ng[i]+1) + (N -ng[i+1] -1 )\n\nSo combining that gives (i[j] +1) plus (N -i[j+1]-1 ), where j is the current loop index?\n\nWait the loop is for each pair of adjacent elements in nglist. \n\nSo the first term given to Math.min is the previous value (ans) between that new value.\n\nThe code is looking for the least number of steps between the different sections of the \"bad\" transitions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is the minimal of all the possible segments between where the inversions are happening. But I need to be careful.\n\nNow, for translating this to C.\n\nThe rest is mathematical comparison, using variables.\n\nSo the translation steps beyond the data structures are:\n\nInitialize ans as the minimum between those two terms (the first and last of the nglist).\n\nThen loop over adjacent elements in the nglist array and compute the value between their positions.\n\nSo in C code:\n\nAfter setting up the nglist array and nglist_size:\n\nIf (nglist_size ==0) {\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nans = min between (N - nglist[0] - 1) and (nglist[nglist_size -1]+1);\n\nThen loop from i=0 to nglist_size -2:\n\nfor each i:\n\ntemp = (nglist[i]+1) + (N - nglist[i+1]-1);\n\n ans = (ans < temp ? ans : temp);\n\nWait, or the other way around because Math.min(a,b) returns the smaller.\n\nWait, yes: temp could be a possible candidate, so if temp is smaller than the current ans, then ans becomes temp.\n\nIn code: \n\nint ans;\n// first calculate the initial min\nint a = N - nglist[0] -1;\nint b = nglist[nglist_size-1] +1;\nans = (a < b) ? a : b;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < nglist_size -1; i++) {\n    int curr = nglist[i];\n    int next = nglist[i+1];\n    int temp = (curr + 1) + (N - next -1);\n    if (temp < ans) ans = temp;\n}\n\nThen print the ans.\n\nSo now the C code:\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nFirst, the necessary includes:\n\nWe need to use 'stdio.h' for input.\n\nThe code would look like this.\n\nWait but in C, arrays of variable sizes (like int P[N]) can be used if N is known at compile time? Well, in modern C (C99), variable-length arrays (VLA) are allowed, but if N is up to 1e5 or something. However, assuming the problem constraints are okay with it, but for code submission contexts (like AtCoder), VLA might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, using malloc, but perhaps the OP expects the code to be in that style.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <limits.h> // for INT_MAX\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int *P = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int)); // Or use VLA if allowed\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int val;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &val);\n        P[i] = val - 1;\n    }\n\n    // Also, create the position array.\n    int position[N]; // Assuming VLA okay here\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        position[P[i]] = i;\n    }\n\n    // Create nglist\n    int nglist[N];\n    int nglist_size = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {\n        int cp = position[i];\n        int np = position[i+1];\n        if( cp > np ) {\n            nglist[nglist_size++] = i;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (nglist_size ==0) { // no NG elements\n        printf(\"0\\n\");\n        free(P);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate ans:\n    int a = N - nglist[0] -1;\n    int b = nglist[nglist_size-1]+1;\n    int ans = (a < b) ? a : b;\n\n    for (int i =0; i< nglist_size-1; i++) {\n        int curr = nglist[i]+1;\n        int next_part = N - nglist[i+1]-1;\n        int temp = curr + next_part;\n        if (temp < ans) ans = temp;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    free(P);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, perhaps need to check if using malloc for P is necessary. Wait, in the original Java code, the array is created as new int[N], so the C code can use a VLA (as allowed in C99 which most compilers support), so P could be defined as:\n\nint P[N]; \n\ninstead of dynamic allocation. Because using malloc messes up when N is 0 but that's impossible here.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use a VLA.\n\nSo the malloc is unnecessary; better to just use an array. Let's re-do without it:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int P[N];\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        int val;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &val);\n        P[i] = val -1;\n    }\n    // position array\n    int position[N];\n    for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {\n        position[P[i]] = i;\n    }\n    // process nglist\n    int nglist[N]; // max possible size is N-1 elements (if all out of order)\n    int nglist_size =0;\n    for(int i =0; i<N-1; ++i) {\n        int current_pos = position[i];\n        int next_pos = position[i+1];\n        if(current_pos > next_pos){\n            nglist[nglist_size] = i;\n            nglist_size++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (nglist_size ==0) {\n        printf(\"0\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    // compute answer\n    int a = N - nglist[0] -1;\n    int b = nglist[nglist_size -1] +1;\n    int ans= (a < b) ? a : b;\n    for(int i=0; i< nglist_size-1; ++i) {\n        int temp = (nglist[i]+1) + (N - nglist[i+1] -1);\n        if( temp < ans ) ans = temp;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHmm, yes. That's the C code. But need to make sure that the loops are correct.\n\nAlso, the initial calculation for ans:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first part was:\n\nans = Math.min( N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(last index) +1 )\n\nYes, which translates directly to the a and b in the code above.\n\nWait for 'b', in Java it was 'nglist.get(nglist.size()-1) +1', which is identical.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let me check possible edge cases.\n\nSample Input/ Output:\n\nSuppose N=3, P is [3,1,2], then P[i] after subtracting 1 becomes [2,0,1].\n\nThe P array is [2,0,1].\n\nposition array:\n\nposition[0] is index of 0 in P: P[1] is 0, so position[0]=1.\n\nposition[1] is P[2]=1, so position[1]=2.\n\nposition[2] is P[0]=2, so position[2] =0.\n\nNow, for each i from 0 to N-2 (i=0 and 1):\n\nCheck for i=0 (element0 and element1):\n\nposition[0] is 1 (from element0's position?), wait no: current value being checked is element i (the key in the map). The loop is checking for each i from 0 to N-2, which is up to N-2.\n\nWait in first step, i=0 (the element 0 and 1):\n\nChecking if position[i=0]'s position (value's position in the array) > position[i+1's element]?\n\nWait, position[0] is 1 (since the element0 is at P[1]), position[1] is 2. So 1 < 2 \u2192 so no, so no added into nglist.\n\nNext i=1 (element1 and 2):\n\nposition[1]=2 (element1's position), position[2] is 0 (position of element2). \n\nSo 2 (position[1]) is greater than position[2] (0). So this is condition true \u2192 so i=1 is added to nglist. \n\nSo the nglist contains [1].\n\nNow, for the ans calculation:\n\na = N - nglist[0] -1 = 3-1-1 =1?\n\nWait N is 3, nglist[0] is 1.\n\nSo a=3-1-1=1? \n\nb is nglist[0]+1 (1+1=2). \n\nSo the initial ans is the smaller of 1 and 2 \u2192 1.\n\nThen the next part, the for loop (since nglist_size is 1, the loop from i=0 to 0 <0 (nglist_size-1 is 0 (1-1=0?), no, the loop is for (i < nglist_size-1).\n\nHere, since nglist_size is 1, the loop is 0<0 \u2192 false, so no iteration.\n\nSo the final ans is 1.\n\nWhat is the correct answer ?\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of swaps to make the permutation sorted (because the problem's scenario is not described here but the original code must have been for a particular problem). \n\nBut in any case, the code's logic would compute 1 for this case, so perhaps that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the permutation: the array P is [2,0,1]. Which, when converted back to indices (assuming the code was about the permutation of 1-based to 0-based?), Not sure but the code may compute the answer based on their logic. \n\nAnyway, the translated code should mirror the logic correctly.\n\nAnother test case: All elements are in order except two inverted. Like N=4. The input 4 1 2 4 3 \u2192 after subtract 1 \u2192 P is [0,1,3,2]\n\nThe position array:\n\nposition[0]=0 (since P[0] is 0)\n\nposition[1] =1 (P[1]=1)\n\nposition[2]=3 (P[3]=2)\n\nposition[3]=2 (P[2]=3)\n\nChecking for each i from 0 to 2:\n\n i=0 check 0 and 1: positions 0 vs1 (OK, no)\n\ni=1 check positions[1]=1 and position[2]=3 \u2192 1 <3 \u2192 no\n\ni=2 (elements2 and3): positions[2]=3 and position[3]=2 \u2192 3>2: so this is true \u2192 added to nglist. \n\nThus the nglist is [2]. \n\nans is min of (4-2-1=1, and (2+1=3 \u2192 so 1).\n\nWhich would be correct? \n\nIn this case, the answer is 1, because swapping positions 2 and 3 (elements3 and 2) would fix the permutation.\n\nYes. So code works here.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct."
