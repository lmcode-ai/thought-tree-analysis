So that's correct. Third condition: else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) ) then:\n\nprintf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1, y2, x2, y1); Wait, the Java code does x1 + \" \" + y2 + \" \" +x2 + \" \" + y1, so yes.

So in C:\n\nabs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)\n\nBecause the variables are integers, so the absolute values are computed as integers. But C's abs is fine here. Now, the debug function in Java is present but not used here. Since the problem doesn't require debugging info, in C we can omit that function. Putting it all into C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2; scanf(\"%d %d % d % d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2); if (x1 == x2) {\n        int dif = abs(y1 - y2);\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2);\n    } else if (y1 == y2) {\n        int dif = abs(x1 - x2);\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif);\n    } else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) {\n        printf(\"%d %d % d %d\\n\", x1, y2, x2, y1);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but in C, the functions must be in correct order. Also, checking for the conditions. Wait also, in the second condition, the code in Java does:\n\npw.println(x1 + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + x2 + \" \" + (y2 + dif)); So the first point is (x1, y1 + dif) and the second point is (x2, y2 + dif). So that's exactly what the C code has. Okay, that should work. Let me test possible cases. First case where x1 equals x2: Test 1: Input: 1 2 1 5\n\nHere, dif is |2-5| = 3. Output should be 1+3=4 for X, so 4 2 and 4 5. So output 4 2 4 5. Which is correct. Another case y1 == y2:\n\nTest 2: Input: 3 4 6 4\n\ndif is 3 (difference between 3 and 6). So output x1 is 3, y1 + dif = 4+3 =7. So 3 7, then x2 (6) and y2 + 3 = 7. So 6 7. The output is 3 7 6 7. Third case:\n\nTest 3:\n\nx1=1,y1=1, x2=3,y2=3. Absolute differences 2 and 2. So condition 3 applies. Output 1 3 and 3 1. Which is correct? Yes, so the code would output those. Fourth case:\n\nInput 1 1 2 3. The differences in x is 1, y is 2. Since they are not equal (1 !=2), then check if other conditions are met. Since x1 !=x2, and y1 != y2, then check (abs(x) vs abs(y) difference). So 1 vs 2, so not equal. So output -1. So code should print -1. Yes. Therefore the code seems correct. Wait one possible error: in the first condition, the code assumes that the direction is to move in the positive x-direction. For example, if y1 is higher than y2, the difference is y1-y2? Wait no, since it is absolute. Suppose y1=5, y2=2: dif is 3. Then adding to x1 would be x1 +3. Wait regardless of direction.",

The structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h> // for abs?\n\nWait, do we need to include abs in C? In C, the standard function is abs for integers, but it's in stdlib.h. So we need to include it.\n\nWait, the original Java uses Math.abs, so in C, I have to use abs(), which requires including stdlib.h.\n\nThe variables x1, y1, x2, y2: in Java they are read via Scanner, in C, read via scanf.\n\nStructure:\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n    ... code here ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nNow the condition checking.\n\nFirst check if x1 == x2:\nif (x1 == x2) {\n    int dif = abs(y1 - y2);\n    printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2);\n}\n\nWait the printf must have the correct format. Wait the Java code's println is:\n\n(x1 + dif) + \" \" + y1 + \" \" + (x1 + dif) + \" \" + y2;\n\nYes, so the four numbers would be (x1 + dif) (the first two), then same x1 + dif, then y2. So the parameters are: (x1 + dif, y1), (x1 + dif, y2). Similarly.\n\nElse if y1 == y2.\n\nThen:\n\nelse if (y1 == y2) {\n    int dif = abs(x1 - x2);\n    printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif);\n}\n\nWait in the Java code, the first two terms are x1 and y1 + dif, and the last two are x2 and y2 + dif. So that's correct.\n\nThird condition: else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) )\n\nthen:\n\nprintf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1, y2, x2, y1);\n\nWait, the Java code does x1 + \" \" + y2 + \" \" +x2 + \" \" + y1, so yes.\n\nElse, print -1.\n\nBut in C, outputting -1 with printf is done via printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait the Java code uses Math.abs, so in C, ensure that.\n\nBut wait, what about if the difference is negative? Taking absolute value.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nAlso, note that in Java, variables are declared with types and initialized in the same line. In C, declarations must be at the start of the block or within braces where they are needed. So since the variables x1, y1 etc. are read at the start, they are declared first.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nThe structure seems straightforward, but what about negative numbers?\n\nWait the problem doesn't specify input constraints, but the code does use absolute values, so it's okay.\n\nWait, also when x1 == x2, but difference could be zero? Wait if the input is two same points, like (1,2 1,2). Then in that case, the first condition would be true, then dif would be zero. Then the output would be (x1, y1, same point again? So x1 + dif is same as x1. Then the output would be the same as the input points? But the problem may require some condition where the output must form some specific shape, but perhaps in problem, that is allowed. Not sure. However, code as given would process that case.\n\nNow, putting the code together.\n\nWait in the third condition, the check is for the absolute difference in x and y being equal. So in C:\n\nabs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)\n\nBecause the variables are integers, so the absolute values are computed as integers.\n\nBut C's abs is fine here.\n\nNow, the debug function in Java is present but not used here. Since the problem doesn't require debugging info, in C we can omit that function.\n\nPutting it all into C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x1, y1, x2, y2;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);\n\n    if (x1 == x2) {\n        int dif = abs(y1 - y2);\n        printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2);\n    } else if (y1 == y2) {\n        int dif = abs(x1 - x2);\n        printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif);\n    } else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) {\n        printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", x1, y2, x2, y1);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the functions must be in correct order. Also, checking for the conditions.\n\nWait also, in the second condition, the code in Java does:\n\npw.println(x1 + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + x2 + \" \" + (y2 + dif));\n\nSo the first point is (x1, y1 + dif) and the second point is (x2, y2 + dif). So that's exactly what the C code has.\n\nOkay, that should work.\n\nLet me test possible cases.\n\nFirst case where x1 equals x2:\n\nTest 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 1 5\n\nHere, dif is |2-5| = 3.\n\nOutput should be 1+3=4 for X, so 4 2 and 4 5. So output 4 2 4 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case y1 == y2:\n\nTest 2:\n\nInput: 3 4 6 4\n\ndif is 3 (difference between 3 and 6).\n\nSo output x1 is 3, y1 + dif = 4+3 =7. So 3 7, then x2 (6) and y2 + 3 = 7. So 6 7. The output is 3 7 6 7.\n\nThird case:\n\nTest 3:\n\nx1=1,y1=1, x2=3,y2=3. Absolute differences 2 and 2. So condition 3 applies.\n\nOutput 1 3 and 3 1. Which is correct?\n\nYes, so the code would output those.\n\nFourth case:\n\nInput 1 1 2 3.\n\nThe differences in x is 1, y is 2. Since they are not equal (1 !=2), then check if other conditions are met. Since x1 !=x2, and y1 != y2, then check (abs(x) vs abs(y) difference). So 1 vs 2, so not equal. So output -1.\n\nSo code should print -1. \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore the code seems correct.\n\nWait one possible error: in the first condition, the code assumes that the direction is to move in the positive x-direction. For example, if y1 is higher than y2, the difference is y1-y2? Wait no, since it is absolute. Suppose y1=5, y2=2: dif is 3. Then adding to x1 would be x1 +3.\n\nWait regardless of direction. The code is moving in x direction. So the first and third points are shifted to the right (assuming positive) by the difference in y. That's okay as per problem logic.\n\nWait why adding to x? Maybe the problem requires a specific shape. But since the Java code does so, we just translate verbatim.\n\nHence the code in C should be correct.\n\nWait also, in the third condition, the condition is written as abs(x1 -x2) == abs(y1 - y2). So exactly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nHmm. The code seems okay. Now, check for possible mistakes in the code structure.\n\nWait in C's main function, the variables are declared at the start. So the code is okay.\n\nAlso, in the first if condition, declaring int dif inside the if is okay, since in C99, declarations can be inside the block. But older C may require variables to be at the top, but assuming the code is written for a C99 compiler.\n\nAlternatively, to make it compatible with older C, you might move variable declarations to the top. But probably best as per original code.\n\nAlternatively, in the first condition's block, declare dif first. Like:\n\nint dif = abs(y1 - y2);\n\nWhich is okay.\n\nHmm, all seems good. So the final code should be as written."
