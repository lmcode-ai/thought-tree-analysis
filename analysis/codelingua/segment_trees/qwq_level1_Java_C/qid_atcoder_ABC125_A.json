    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me look at the Java code first. The problem is about calculating some number based on inputs. Let me see the steps here.\n\nThe Java code starts by importing Scanner, then reads three integers: sec, per_num, and max_sec (with a 0.5 added as a double). Then there's a loop that increments i from sec to max_sec in steps of sec, adding per_num each time to ans_num. Finally, it prints ans_num.\n\nHmm, translating to C. First, C doesn't have a Scanner class. So we'll need to use standard input functions like scanf. Let's outline the steps.\n\nThe variables in Java are:\n\n- sec: an integer.\n- per_num: integer.\n- max_sec is read as a double with 0.5 added. Wait, looking back, the third input is read as a double and then 0.5 is added? Wait no, the Java code says (double) sc.nextInt() + 0.5. Let me check: sc.nextInt() gets the third input as an integer, then cast to double and add 0.5. So that's converting the third input to a double, then adding 0.5. So the max_sec is (the third integer + 0.5). Wait no: (double)(third integer) plus 0.5. So for example if the third input is 5, it becomes 5.0 + 0.5 =5.5. So maybe the third input is intended to be a number where we take its value and add half a second? Or perhaps the problem requires some kind of ceiling? Not sure, but the code as written does that.\n\nIn C, variables: Let's see. The loop runs while i < max_sec. But since in Java, i is initialized to sec (an int), and max_sec is a double. So i is an int, but being compared to a double. Hmm. Wait, in the loop condition: the i is an integer, but max_sec is a double, so in C, maybe I need to handle that correctly.\n\nBut in C, variables must have types. So how do I represent max_sec? As a double. The loop variable i can be an integer. Let's see.\n\nSo in the for loop in C:\n\nfor (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) { ans_num += per_num; }\n\nWait, but in C, loop variables can be declared in the initialization part.\n\nSo first, the inputs:\n\nWe need to read three integers from input. The third is converted to double, then 0.5 added. So in C, we can read the third input as an integer, then perform (double)third + 0.5.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead three integers: sec, per_num, third (for the max calculation). Then compute max_sec as (double) third + 0.5.\n\nNow, in C, how to code this?\n\nStart with including necessary headers.\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nThen the main function returns int, so:\n\nint main() {\n\nThen variables:\n\nint sec, per_num, third;\ndouble max_sec;\nscanf(\"%d %d %d\", &sec, &per_num, &third);\nmax_sec = (double)third + 0.5;\n\nThen initialize ans_num to 0.\n\nint ans_num = 0;\n\nThen the loop: for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) {\n\nEach iteration adds per_num to ans_num.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) {\n    ans_num += per_num;\n}\n\nThen print the ans_num with printf(\"%d\\n\", ans_num);\n\nWait, but what about possible issues with floating point comparisons? Since i is an integer and max_sec is a double, but since i starts at sec (an integer), and increments by sec each step, which is also an integer, then the comparison i < max_sec is okay. Since even if max_sec is a fractional value, as long as i is less than that, the loop continues.\n\nWait let me think of an example. Suppose sec is 2, third value is 5. So max_sec is 5.0 +0.5 =5.5. Then the loop starts at i=2. Then 2, 4, 6. Wait, 6 would be 2+2*2=6? Wait no, 2 increments by 2 each time: 2, then 4, then 6. Wait, 2 is less than 5.5, so yes. Then 4 is less than 5.5, so again yes. Then 6 is 6>5.5, so loop stops. So in the loop, when i reaches 6, it's not less than 5.5, so the loop stops. So in this case, the loop runs for 2 and4, so two iterations: adds per_num twice. The total would be per_num * 2.\n\nWait let's see. Let's see the original Java code: The loop runs for i starting at 'sec' (e.g. 2) and while i < max_sec (5.5 in this case), each time adding sec (so 2+2=4, then adding 2 again gives 6, but that's not less than 5.5, so only 2 and 4 are included. So two loops, adding 2 times per_num.\n\nNow when writing in C, the same logic should hold. Since the variables are same types, the code should translate properly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In C, variables must be declared before they're used. So in the for loop's initialization, i is declared there, which should be okay.\n\nTesting for edge cases: like when sec is zero? Wait, but in problem constraints, I'm not sure. Maybe in the problem assumptions, sec is positive? Because otherwise division by zero might occur, but in the code, if sec is 0 then the loop will never run (since adding zero each time). But assuming that the input is correct as per the problem's constraints.\n\nAnother point: the code uses sc.nextInt() three times. So the inputs are three integers. So in C's scanf, we need to read three integers.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int sec, per_num, third;\n    double max_sec;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &sec, &per_num, &third);\n    max_sec = (double)third + 0.5;\n    int ans_num = 0;\n    for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) {\n        ans_num += per_num;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans_num);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but wait, what if 'sec' is zero? Well, the problem may not require handling that case, but in code it would loop infinitely if sec is zero, but perhaps the problem's constraints prevent that. So the code as written should be correct.\n\nLet me double-check the loop. The original Java code's for loop starts at i=sec, and on each iteration adds sec to i.\n\nWait the Java loop is written as for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) { ... so same as C's loop.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's all. The rest is just direct translation with the appropriate types and functions."
