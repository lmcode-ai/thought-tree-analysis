Therefore the code can be done with standard scanf/printf. Therefore the C code would be the simple version above. But in the user's instruction, they said \"translate the Java code below to C\".

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's start by looking at what the Java code does. The main part is reading three numbers: an integer r, an integer d, and a long x. Then it calculates x = r * x - d ten times and prints each result. The bulk of the code is a custom scanner class called SimpleScanner, which handles input.\n\nIn C, we don't have classes and objects, so I need to reimplement the scanner functionality using standard C functions. The main steps would be:\n\nFirst, process the input. The main function in C will read from stdin. Since the Java code uses a custom scanner that can read integers and longs, I need to parse those from input in C. The standard way in C is to use scanf, but since the problem might require reading multiple numbers from a line, perhaps I need to read the entire line first.\n\nWait, the Java scanner's nextInt and nextLong might be parsing the next token, so maybe the input is given in three space-separated integers. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the main code: in Java's main, it does scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextLong(). So the input is three numbers on a single line, probably. So the C program can read three numbers with scanf, but when using scanf, the order and formats need to be correct.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the SimpleScanner's next* functions read the next token, which is the standard way of input handling. So the first line of input contains three numbers: r, d, x. So in C, the equivalent code can be done with scanf:\n\nint r, d;\nlong long x;\nscanf(\"%d %d %lld\", &r, &d, &x);\nThen loop 10 times, compute x = r*x -d and print each result.\n\nWait that seems straightforward. But the problem here is maybe the actual code is a bit more complicated? Because the provided Java code includes a custom scanner class, perhaps for efficiency or handling larger inputs? But maybe for the problem's context here, it's simple since the input is exactly three numbers. So the C code can be written simply with scanf and printf loops.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The Java code is for a programming competition problem (AtCoder ABC127 B). So the problem might have input as three integers on a single line. The actual code's loop calculates the next x as r*x -d for 10 steps and outputs each. So the core part is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the main code in C is as simple as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int r, d;\n    long long x;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %lld\", &r, &d, &x);\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        x = r * x - d;\n        printf(\"%lld\\n\", x);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait is that right? Oh that might be all. But the problem here is, why did the Java code use a custom scanner? Perhaps the problem requires reading from a potentially large input, but in this case, it's just three numbers. So perhaps that's the key here. The user's Java code uses a custom scanner, so maybe the C code just needs to replicate that input reading mechanism?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem, the input is three numbers on a single line, so the C code can handle that with scanf as above.\n\nWait the problem's title is B from ABC127. Let me check what problem B was. Oh maybe I can quickly recall or search. Alternatively, maybe the problem is as stated: given r, d, x, compute the next x 10 times with x_{n+1} = r*x_n -d. So the problem doesn't have large input that would need a fast scanner. Therefore the code can be done with standard scanf/printf.\n\nTherefore the C code would be the simple version above. But in the user's instruction, they said \"translate the Java code below to C\". So perhaps they want a direct translation, including reimplementing the scanner functionality in C style, even if in practice the scanf version is sufficient?\n\nHmm that's tricky. The user might expect the C code to handle the input the same way, but in C's terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SimpleScanner is just for efficiency in Java, but in C, we can use standard methods. Therefore, the sample code in C would not need the same overhead of a custom scanner, and can use scanf as the main solution.\n\nThe user might have included the SimpleScanner to show it's part of the code to translate, but perhaps for C, using scanf is acceptable here.\n\nThus, the minimal correct C code is the concise version I suggested. But to ensure correctness:\n\nLet me recheck the code step by step.\n\nThe Java version does:\n\n- Read r as nextInt, then d as nextInt, then x as nextLong. So first two are integers, third is long (since in Java long is 64-bit, same as C's long long).\n\nSo in C, to read the third as a long long, using %lld in scanf is correct.\n\nThen the loop runs 10 times, each time x is updated as r*x -d, then printed.\n\nThus the code in C should be exactly the above. Let me write that and see. The problem then is probably straightforward. The user might expect that.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have a hidden requirement. For example, in Java's SimpleScanner, there is some way of handling input which could handle large inputs efficiently. But unless the problem specifies that the input can be large, which is not likely here, it's okay to use standard scanf.\n\nTherefore, the correct C code is as I wrote above.\n\nWait let me test with sample input.\n\nSuppose an input is:\n\n2 3 5\n\nThen the first iteration:\n\nx = 2 *5 -3 =7 \u2192 then 2*7-3= 11, etc. So 10 iterations would output 7,11,19,35,67,131,259,515,1027, 2051.\n\nWait let me check with code:\n\nYes. So the main code's core is exactly that.\n\nTherefore the answer is the simple C code using scanf, without needing to reimplement the SimpleScanner in C, unless required. Since the user's instruction is to translate the given Java code to C, perhaps they expect that the entire code (including the scanner implementation) be translated to C, but that would be a more complex undertaking.\n\nWait the Java code has a custom scanner to read from input, so perhaps the translation requires handling input in C in a similar way?\n\nHmm that complicates things. So if I need to translate all the code, including the SimpleScanner, into C, then I have to reimplement a similar input handling mechanism in C.\n\nIn Java, the SimpleScanner is a class to read tokens efficiently. Since Java's Scanner can be slow for large inputs, hence the custom scanner.\n\nIn C, since we're reading just three values, the standard scanf is sufficient, but if the problem required reading from a large stream, perhaps with a buffer, we might have to write a buffer in C.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to port the SimpleScanner code in C, but since the code is provided, but the main logic is straightforward, perhaps they're okay with the simple solution.\n\nWait the question says \"translate the Java code below to C\". So the entire code, including the scanner, must be translated? That would be the case. Because the provided Java code includes the SimpleScanner class, which is necessary for the code to run.\n\nThe C code will need a way to read the three inputs, so we can replicate a scanner-like structure in C, maybe using a reader function.\n\nAlternatively, since in C, there's no object system, but we can write functions. Let's see.\n\nThe main code in Java uses a SimpleScanner to read the three numbers. Translating that, in C, the SimpleScanner's functionality needs to be implemented. But perhaps that is not necessary if we can use standard C functions to read the input directly. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SimpleScanner is over-engineered for this problem, since in C it's possible to read with the standard way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the code to have similar logic. Let me see.\n\nThe provided Java's SimpleScanner reads characters in buffer. Since in C, perhaps we need to read data from stdin, but using standard functions. The problem is that the Java code's way of reading is somewhat more complicated than needed, so if the C code is to mimic that, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using getchar() for reading character by character, but in the Java code, the SimpleScanner reads a chunk of data into the buffer. In C, using getchar_unlocked or similar (but that's C specifics, perhaps non-standard).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to use scanf as I described before.\n\nWait but the problem requires translating all code. So the code includes the scanner. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the SimpleScanner's logic: it reads input into a CharBuffer, but since in Java, streams can sometimes be slow. In C, the code might need to handle buffered input similarly? However, for small input like 3 numbers, that's unnecessary, but if the problem's inputs are large, buffering is needed.\n\nBut the problem here is that the code may not be required for standard input handling beyond reading three numbers. So, perhaps the minimal approach is best here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed where input could be anything, so that the code must be robust. Therefore, to replicate the SimpleScanner.\n\nBut in C, reading a line and parsing tokens would be needed. Let me try to think of a way.\n\nAlternatively, the core issue is that the SimpleScanner's nextInt and nextLong just read token and convert to numbers. In C, perhaps we can read the entire line at once, then use sscanf to parse the numbers. Let's see.\n\nIn main:\n\nRead the line using fgets. Then parse using sscanf.\n\nBut the line can be read as, for example:\n\nchar line[1024];\nfgets(line, sizeof line, stdin);\nsscanf(line, \"%d %d %lld\", &r, &d, &x);\n\nBut that would work if the three numbers are on the first line. Which they are, per the original problem's input.\n\nHence this would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using scanf without the line buffer is okay as before.\n\nThe original Java code uses nextInt which skips whitespace and reads until a non-digit, so the C code's scanf will do similarly.\n\nHowever, in C, scanf may require three entries on the same line, which matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal C code would work fine.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is the simple C code as before.\n\nNow, to write that code precisely:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int r, d;\n    long long x;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d %lld\", &r, &d, &x) != 3) { \n        // handle error? Probably not required for programming competition code\n    }\n    for(int i =0; i<10; i++) {\n        x = r *x -d;\n        printf(\"%lld\\n\", x);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct code.\n\nWait but in the Java code, the scanner is reading from System.in. The C code uses stdin, which is exactly what scanf expects.\n\nHence, this should work.\n\nSo the answer is the code above. The user might have included the entire Java code including the scanner to show the code's structure, but the main logic is straightforward. Since the problem is from AtCoder, the input is probably given as three space-separated integers on one line, so the code is correct."
