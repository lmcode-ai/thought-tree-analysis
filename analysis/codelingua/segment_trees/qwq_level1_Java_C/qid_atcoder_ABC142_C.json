That is, for the current A value, store the current index in the position A's value. For example, if the first input A is 3, then at array[3] = 1. Then the next A is 1, so array[1] =2, etc.\n3. Then, iterate from k=1 to N, and print the array[k], each separated by space. Wait, yes, that's exactly how the Java code uses the map. Since A's are unique and between 1 and N, the array will have exactly one entry for each key from 1 to N, so each array[k] will have an index i such that A_i=k. Therefore in C, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read N.\n- Allocate an array of size N+1 (since the maximum A is N). Let's say int arr[N+1]; (but in C, we can't have variable-sized arrays unless it's at a point where the compiler knows N is known. So perhaps using dynamically allocated array via malloc would be better? But for the problem constraints, maybe N can be reasonably up to, say, 1e5 or something; but given that AtCoder problems often have constraints, probably manageable. So steps in code:\n\nInitialize an array (let's say arr of size N+1). Initialize all elements to zero or whatever, but then overwrite them as we go. Loop through each of the N A values. For each i from 1 to N:\n\nRead the A value. Then, set arr[A] =i.\n\nOnce that's done, loop from k=1 to N, and print arr[k] followed by space. Also need to take care of trailing space after last element? But in the Java code, the code does print a space after each, so in C, maybe the output will have a trailing space. The problem's sample inputs might expect that, but perhaps not. Well, let's see. Looking at the sample input:\n\nSuppose input is 3, and then 3 1 2.",

Wait no, in the code presented, it's all print statements. It would be better to add a new line at the end. Alternatively, in the C code, after the for loop, add printf(\"\\n\"); so that the output has a trailing newline. Because the absence of which might cause a wrong answer. Alternatively, perhaps in Java, the code actually does print a new line. Wait the Java code doesn't have anything after the for loop; the main terminates. So the output would not include a newline. Oh but maybe the problem requires that the output is exactly N elements separated by space with no trailing space, but that's a possibility. So perhaps the Java code is incorrect in the trailing space, but the user wants to translate it regardless. Alternatively, the Java code might have used a loop different than for i=1..N? Let me see the Java code's output loop:\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {\n    print value then \" \". So that's N elements, each with a space. So the total has N spaces. But the correct output would be N numbers separated by space, so total N numbers with N-1 spaces. So this code is incorrect in that aspect. So the trailing space might be a problem. Wait yes, that's a problem. The original Java code is wrong here. Let me check. The code in Java is looping from 1 to N, and for each, it does print the value followed by a space. So for N=3, it's 2 followed by space, then 3 and space, then 1 plus space. So the total output is \"2 3 1 \" with a final space. But the desired output is \"2 3 1 \" without the space?",

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the C code is as written. Now, think about possible edge cases. For example N=1: input is 1, then after processing, arr[1] is 1. Output is 1 followed by a space.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into C. Hmm. Let's see. The Java code reads some input and then does something with a map. Let me first understand what the Java code does step by step.\n\nThe code starts by importing java.util.*, which in Java is common for using Scanner and other utilities. Then there's a class called atcoder_ABC142_C. Inside, there's a main method. The main gets a Scanner from System.in. It reads N, which is probably the number of elements. Then, it creates a Map called idorder, which maps integers to integers. Then, for each i from 1 to N, it reads an A (so N times). Each A is stored in the map with the key as A and the value as the current i. So after all elements are read, the map's key is the A value, and the value is the index (1-based) where that A was placed. Then, the code loops from 1 to N again, and for each i, it gets the value from the map (so the original index where A = i) and prints it, separated by spaces.\n\nSo the goal of this code is, given a list of A's where each A is a unique number from 1 to N (since they are keys?), to output the indices in the order of the A's sorted by their value. Wait, or perhaps the problem is to, for each position 1 to N, find which original index had that A. Let me think: when you input the A's, each A corresponds to a position. For example, if N is 3, and the inputs for A are 3,1,2, then the map would have entries like 3:1 (since first A is 3, so when the key is 3, the value is 1), 1:2, and 2:3. Then when you loop i from 1 to 3, you get the value for key 1 (which is 2), then key 2 (which is 3), then key 3 (which is 1). So the output is 2 3 1.\n\nSo the problem is, given N integers A_1, A_2,...A_N, where each A_i is unique and between 1 and N, output the numbers from 1 to N in the order of their inverse: for each k from 1 to N, find the index i where A_i =k, and output those indices in order of k.\n\nSo the C code needs to do the same. Since C doesn't have a built-in hash map, we need an alternative. Since the keys are from 1 to N, perhaps we can use an array. Because the keys are integers starting at 1 up to N. So the maximum possible key is N, so we can create an array of size N+1 (indexes from 0 to N, but we'll use 1-based here). So for each A, we can store its index in the array. That's probably the right approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps for C:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Read N integers A_1 through A_N. For each i (starting at 1), store the index i (1-based) in an array. That is, for the current A value, store the current index in the position A's value. For example, if the first input A is 3, then at array[3] = 1. Then the next A is 1, so array[1] =2, etc.\n3. Then, iterate from k=1 to N, and print the array[k], each separated by space.\n\nWait, yes, that's exactly how the Java code uses the map. Since A's are unique and between 1 and N, the array will have exactly one entry for each key from 1 to N, so each array[k] will have an index i such that A_i=k.\n\nTherefore in C, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read N.\n- Allocate an array of size N+1 (since the maximum A is N). Let's say int arr[N+1]; (but in C, we can't have variable-sized arrays unless it's at a point where the compiler knows N is known. So perhaps using dynamically allocated array via malloc would be better? But for the problem constraints, maybe N can be reasonably up to, say, 1e5 or something; but given that AtCoder problems often have constraints, probably manageable.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nInitialize an array (let's say arr of size N+1). Initialize all elements to zero or whatever, but then overwrite them as we go.\n\nLoop through each of the N A values. For each i from 1 to N:\n\nRead the A value. Then, set arr[A] =i.\n\nOnce that's done, loop from k=1 to N, and print arr[k] followed by space. Also need to take care of trailing space after last element? But in the Java code, the code does print a space after each, so in C, maybe the output will have a trailing space. The problem's sample inputs might expect that, but perhaps not. Well, let's see.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSuppose input is 3, and then 3 1 2. The code would output 2 3 1 followed by a space. But when printed, does the Java code print a trailing space? In the code, yes. Let me check: the code does System.out.print(\" \") each iteration, which includes after the last one. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe loop in Java is:\n\nfor (i from 1 to N), then:\n\nprint the value, then print a space. So for N=3, the first i=1: it prints idorder.get(1) (which is 2) followed by a space, then next i=2: 3 and space, and i=3: 1 followed by a space. So the total is \"2 3 1 \", with an extra space at the end. But in some programming competition problems, that trailing space might be allowed, but sometimes not. But according to the problem statement for ABC142 C (assuming this code is for that problem), we have to check what the output expects. Well, the original code would have that trailing space, so the translation must replicate that, but maybe the problem accepts that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the output is the numbers separated by spaces without a trailing space. But since the original code includes the trailing space, better to match it unless it's a problem. So in C code, do the same.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nInclude necessary headers. We'll need to read from stdin. So include <stdio.h>.\n\nThen, in main function:\n\nRead N. Then, read N integers. So perhaps:\n\nint N;\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nThen, allocate the array. Since in C, arrays must be declared with a size known at compile time unless using dynamic allocation. Since N can be up to whatever (for the problem), but in programming competition problems, it's often up to 1e5 or even 1e6. So using a dynamic array may be better. Alternatively, use a maximum size array. But variable length arrays (VLA) are allowed in C99. So perhaps we can write:\n\nint arr[N +1]; // since array indices start at 1.\n\nThen, initialize all elements to 0 or whatever, but since we process all A values in order, and each A is between 1 and N, and unique, so each exactly once. So no need for initialization. But perhaps better to set them to 0 first? Not needed since every A will be processed.\n\nWait, but in the loop, for each of the N elements, you read A_i (the first A is A_1?), then for each i (the index in 1-based) you set arr[A] = i. So the code.\n\nWait, the loop over the A's:\n\nfor (int i =1; i<=N; i++){\n\n   int A;\n   scanf(\"%d\", &A);\n\n   arr[A] =i;\n}\n\nThen, after that, print the elements of the array from 1 to N:\n\nfor (int k=1; k<=N; k++){\n\n   printf(\"%d \", arr[k]);\n\n}\n\nWhich will indeed add a space after each, including the last one. However, the problem might expect no trailing space, but perhaps in the Java code, it's allowed. Anyway, the code must replicate the original Java's behavior.\n\nNow, let me code this:\n\nWait, the code would look like this:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int arr[N+1]; // size N+1, indices 0..N. 0 unused.\n    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {\n        int A;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A);\n        arr[A] = i;\n    }\n    for (int k=1; k<=N; k++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[k]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\"); // maybe missing in Java? The Java code doesn't do a newline, but let me check.\n}\n\nWait the Java code does System.out.print(\" \") each time, but does not add a new line. Wait, in Java code, the output loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n    System.out.print(idorder.get(i));\n    System.out.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo after the last element, it prints the number followed by a space, but no newline. However, in some online judges, it might require the output to have a newline. The original code in Java doesn't print a newline, so perhaps the problem allows it? Or perhaps the problem requires a trailing newline.\n\nBut let's see, the C code, in order to match the Java code's output, should not have a new line? Wait, no, because the Java code's System.out.print doesn't add a new line. However, in practice, sometimes the Java code would end with a new line automatically? No, only if there is a System.out.println.\n\nWait that code won't have a new line. So in C code, the final output from the loop won't have a new line. So the code would output the numbers followed by a space, but no new line. However, in many programming problems, the output is expected to end with a new line. So perhaps the code should add a new line at the end.\n\nWait the problem might state that. Since I can't check the problem, I have to assume the code is correct as per the user's original code. So if the Java code does not print a new line, then the C code should also not, but that could be a problem in some cases. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the Java code's final output:\n\nSuppose N=3 and the inputs give 2 3 1 as output, the code would print \"2 3 1 \" without a new line. In some online judges, this might be marked as incorrect because of the trailing space, or because it expects a new line. But perhaps the problem allows it; perhaps the actual problem requires the space-separated numbers with nothing else. Alternatively, maybe the Java code has a System.out.println for the loop? Wait no, in the code presented, it's all print statements. It would be better to add a new line at the end.\n\nAlternatively, in the C code, after the for loop, add printf(\"\\n\"); so that the output has a trailing newline. Because the absence of which might cause a wrong answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Java, the code actually does print a new line. Wait the Java code doesn't have anything after the for loop; the main terminates. So the output would not include a newline. Oh but maybe the problem requires that the output is exactly N elements separated by space with no trailing space, but that's a possibility. So perhaps the Java code is incorrect in the trailing space, but the user wants to translate it regardless.\n\nAlternatively, the Java code might have used a loop different than for i=1..N? Let me see the Java code's output loop:\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {\n    print value then \" \". So that's N elements, each with a space. So the total has N spaces. But the correct output would be N numbers separated by space, so total N numbers with N-1 spaces. So this code is incorrect in that aspect. So the trailing space might be a problem.\n\nWait yes, that's a problem. The original Java code is wrong here. Let me check.\n\nThe code in Java is looping from 1 to N, and for each, it does print the value followed by a space. So for N=3, it's 2 followed by space, then 3 and space, then 1 plus space. So the total output is \"2 3 1 \" with a final space. But the desired output is \"2 3 1 \" without the space? Or wait the correct output should have no trailing space. So the Java code is wrong in this aspect. Hmm. But the user wants to translate this code as given. So I should translate it as written.\n\nThus, the C code should produce the same output as the Java code (including the trailing space). So the code in C should have the same issue.\n\nTherefore, proceed.\n\nNow, in C, the code would be as above. Let me structure the code properly.\n\nWait also note that in C, the input can be read with scanf, but we have to read all the A's properly.\n\nAnother thing to note is variable scope for C. In the loop, the for loop declarations are okay in C99, but if using older compilers, maybe need different syntax. But assuming modern compiler.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    int arr[N+1]; // indices 0..N, so N+1 elements. Only 1..N used.\n\n    // Initialize the array? Not necessary, but zero might be default?\n    // Not necessary as all A's are processed and stored.\n\n    for (int i =1; i<=N; i++) {\n        int A;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A);\n        arr[A] = i;\n    }\n\n    // Output the entries from 1 to N.\n\n    for (int k =1; k<=N; k++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[k]);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but wait, what about the possibility that the A values are not exactly 1-based? Like in the problem, the problem probably states that each A_i is unique and between 1 and N. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if an A is out of that range? Then the code might access an invalid index in the array. However, such cases are probably not within the problem's constraints, so we can proceed.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation. Let me double-check.\n\nJava code:\n\nRead N.\n\nFor i from 1 to N:\n\nRead A (which must be between 1 and N), store idorder[A] =i.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to N, print the value at idorder[i], followed by a space.\n\nThe C code does exactly that with an array. The keys (i) are 1 to N, and the array holds the i-th index.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the C code is as written.\n\nNow, think about possible edge cases. For example N=1: input is 1, then after processing, arr[1] is 1. Output is 1 followed by a space.\n\nBut that would be okay according to the code's logic. The code does what the original Java does.\n\nTherefore the correct C code is as above."
