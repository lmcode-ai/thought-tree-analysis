Because some platforms may have longer lines, even though in this problem it's unlikely. So the final C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char line[1024];\n    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n    int Sheep, Wolve;\n    sscanf(line, \"%d %d\", &Sheep, &Wolve); if (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n        printf(\"unsafe\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"safe\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in the Java code, the input is read until an error (like exception thrown when no more lines).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads input lines until an exception occurs, which probably means until EOF. Then it splits the first line into two integers, Sheep and Wolve. If wolves are >= sheep, it prints \"unsafe\", else \"safe\".\n\nHmm, in C, there's no Scanner or ArrayList. So I need to handle input differently. Let's think about how to read lines until EOF. Since C doesn't have try-catch, maybe we can read until fgets returns NULL. But since it's command line input, perhaps the input is a single line, but the Java code seems to read multiple lines until error. Wait, looking at the Java code's loop: for (int i=0; i>=0; i++) it adds each line until an exception. But in practice, when there's no more input, nextLine throws an exception, so the loop stops. So scList will hold all input lines.\n\nBut in the problem, the code is using the first line's split parts. So maybe the input is just a single line with two numbers. Because the problem is from AtCoder ABC164 A, maybe the actual problem requires reading two integers from a single line. Otherwise, if there are multiple lines, but only the first line is used, perhaps the code is overcomplicating. But the user's code is what it is; need to translate as per code's structure.\n\nWait, in C, we can read all input lines into an array, but we need to know how much to read. Alternatively, the code in Java is reading all lines until failure, then taking first line's split. But perhaps, in the problem's context, the input is just one line. Let me think the problem requires reading just one line, two numbers. Let me check the AtCoder problem ABC164 A. Wait, I can't access that right now, but maybe the code's logic implies that only the first line's two numbers matter. So in the Java code, even if multiple lines are read, only the first line is processed. So the C code can read a single line.\n\nAlternatively, the code is reading all lines but only the first is used. Let's proceed.\n\nIn C, the approach would be:\n\n- Read input line from stdin. Let's use fgets. The problem is to read the first line's two integers.\n\nWait, but the Java code reads all lines until an exception (so until EOF), then takes first line. So in C, perhaps we just read the first line and split the two numbers, since that's all that matters here. The loop in the original Java is perhaps to read until EOF, but in the end, only the first line's numbers are used. So maybe the problem's input is a single line with two integers, so in C code, we can read that line once.\n\nTherefore, the steps for the C code would be:\n\n1. Read a line from stdin (the first line, which is the only needed one).\n\n2. Split the line into two integers, Sheep and Wolve.\n\n3. Compare and print \"unsafe\" or \"safe\".\n\nNow, let's think about C code structure. The program can be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[100]; // Assuming input line is not too long.\n    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) {\n        // handle error but probably not needed as per problem\n    }\n    // Split into two integers\n    int Sheep, Wolve;\n    sscanf(buffer, \"%d %d\", &Sheep, &Wolve);\n    if (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n        printf(\"unsafe\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"safe\");\n    }\n    // Add new line? The Java code might have had system.out.println, which adds newline. So in C, printf with newline?\n    printf( \"safe\\n\" or \"unsafe\\n\");\n}\n\nWait, the Java code uses System.out.println, so it adds a newline. So the C code should also print with a new line.\n\nWait in the Java sample code, the print statements are System.out.println, which adds a new line. Therefore, in C, the equivalent would be to have a \\n at the end of the string.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\n...\n\nif (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n    printf(\"unsafe\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"safe\\n\");\n}\n\nThe buffer. Since the line can be up to some length. Maybe reading a line with, say, 100 characters is sufficient. However, it's better to use a dynamic approach but perhaps for the problem's constraints, a fixed size is enough.\n\nSo the code would be something like that.\n\nWait the Java code uses ArrayList to collect all lines. But in our case, only first line's parts are needed. So in C, no need to collect anything else. Just read the first line.\n\nWhat about errors? The Java stops on exception, but in C, perhaps the file is just read until the first line, but in case of invalid input, perhaps it's okay (since the problem probably gives valid input as per competition standards). So we can assume input is correct.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, splitting by space. Using sscanf with \"%d %d\" will do the same.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Leading or trailing spaces? But sscanf with %d skips whitespace so even if there are more spaces it's okay.\n\nThus, the C code would look like the following.\n\nWait, let me also check the original code:\n\nThe Java code's loop reads lines until an exception. But then the first element is used. So even if the input is multiple lines, the first line is used. So the first line is the one with the numbers. So in C, even if multiple lines are entered, as long as the first line has two integers, the code will process correctly. The buffer in C will read the first line, which is okay.\n\nThus, the code would be as I described.\n\nNow let's code this properly.\n\nThe code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char line[100];\n    if (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) == NULL) {\n        return 1; // error\n    }\n\n    int sheep, wolf;\n    if (sscanf(line, \"%d %d\", &sheep, &wolf) != 2) {\n        // invalid input, but according to problem's constraints, input is correct\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (wolf >= sheep) {\n        printf(\"unsafe\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"safe\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, the variable names in the Java code are Sheep and Wolve, but the problem's actual names? Probably doesn't matter, but in C we can name the variables similarly. The code uses Wolve, not Wolf. Hmm. So in C, 'wolf' or 'wolve'?\n\nThe code variables are:\n\nint Sheep = ... ; // the count\nint Wolve = ...;\n\nWait in the code:\n\nnumlist[0] is Sheep (split first part) and numlist[1] is Wolve (the second part).\n\nThus, in C, variable names would be sheep and wolve, but in C I used wolf. Wait that might be a problem. Wolve is the variable name in Java, perhaps it's a typo for wolf. Probably, but in the problem's code, the count is of wolves, so the correct variable name is Wolf, but in the given java code it's Wolve. Wait maybe a typo.\n\nWait the original Java code has:\n\nint Sheep = ...;\n\nint Wolve = ...;\n\nWait \"wolve\" is possible a typo for \"wolf\", but in code it's correct. So in C, we need to use the same variable names? Not necessary, but to follow the code's logic, perhaps keep the names as per the logic.\n\nSo in the C code:\n\nint Sheep, Wolve;\n\nBut in C variable names are fine.\n\nBut the code's logic is:\n\nif (Wolve >= Sheep) print unsafe else safe.\n\nWait that makes sense: if wolves are >= sheep, then unsafe.\n\nWait in the code's variables, \"Wolve\" is the number of wolves. So in the code, the variable name is Wolve. So maybe I should use 'Wolve' for clarity? Although wolf would be better, but the user's code uses Wolve so perhaps follow the same names.\n\nWait in the Java code, the variable is named Wolve. Let me check the user-provided code:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC164_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n        ArrayList<String> scList = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {\n            try {\n                scList.add(scan.nextLine());\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        String[] numlist = scList.get(0).split(\" \");\n        int Sheep = Integer.parseInt(numlist[0]);\n        int Wolve = Integer.parseInt(numlist[1]);\n        if (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n            System.out.println(\"unsafe\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"safe\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYes, the variables are Sheep (with capital S) and Wolve (with v). So when translating to C, variables are named Sheep and Wolve. In C, variable names are case-sensitive and lowercase is typical. But the names can be in Java style. So can use int Sheep, Wolve;\n\nBut in C, the variables can be in camel case? Yes, but more common to use lowercase. But following the original variables' names may be important for the user, so perhaps keep the variable names as in Java.\n\nThus, the code would have:\n\nint Sheep, Wolve;\n\nThen:\n\nsscanf(..., &Sheep, &Wolve);\n\nThen the condition is as in Java.\n\nThus, the C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char line[100];\n    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n    int Sheep, Wolve;\n    sscanf(line, \"%d %d\", &Sheep, &Wolve);\n\n    if (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n        printf(\"unsafe\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"safe\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the input collection loop uses an exception to break when there is no more input. However, in C, using fgets would read the first line. So if the input is coming from a file with multiple lines, but the first one has the correct numbers, the code would still work. If the input comes line by line from standard input, but the first line is given first, the code is okay.\n\nAnother point: the Java code is getting the first element of the list (scList.get(0)) \u2014 meaning the first line entered. Which is exactly what the C code is doing.\n\nTherefore, this should work.\n\nBut perhaps there's an issue with the line length. For example, if the first line is longer than 99 characters (since the buffer is 100 characters), then using fgets may not read the entire line, but in the context of the problem, perhaps that's acceptable. For example, the problem's input's first line is two integers separated by space, so the buffer size should be more than enough. Let's pick a reasonable size like 1024.\n\nAlternatively, to make the code robust, perhaps using a bigger buffer, like 1024.\n\nSo changing the code:\n\nchar line[1024];\n\nBetter. Because some platforms may have longer lines, even though in this problem it's unlikely.\n\nSo the final C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char line[1024];\n    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n    int Sheep, Wolve;\n    sscanf(line, \"%d %d\", &Sheep, &Wolve);\n\n    if (Wolve >= Sheep) {\n        printf(\"unsafe\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"safe\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in the Java code, the input is read until an error (like exception thrown when no more lines). But since in C, the code reads the first line, which is exactly what the Java code uses, this should be equivalent.\n\nAnother thing to test: in the Java code, the split on space, which in C the %d consumes whitespace, so even if multiple spaces, it is okay.\n\nEdge cases: suppose Sheep is 0. But according to the problem's constraints, maybe Sheep is non-zero, but the code would handle per the problem's logic.\n\nSo this should work."
