    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me look through the Java code first.\n\nHmm, the Java code seems to handle some graph traversal, maybe BFS or DFS. It's using a Point class with friends stored in a HashMap. The main method reads input for nodes and edges, then does a DFS to assign colors based on the path length parity. The colors are 0 or 1 depending on whether the accumulated length is even or odd. \n\nTranslating that to C... C doesn't have classes or objects, so I need to represent the Point structure with structs and manage linked lists for friends. Since Java uses HashMaps for friends, in C maybe an adjacency list using a linked list would work better. Also, the DFS function in Java is recursive, so in C I should use recursion too, but I have to be careful with stack depth. Since it's a tree (since n-1 edges), there's no cycles, so recursion depth doesn't hit limits.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. Main variables:\n\n- n is the number of nodes, m edges since it's n-1 edges (a tree).\n- colors array. Each entry is 0,1 or -1 for unvisited. Wait, in C, arrays are 0-based, so same as Java here. So colors is an array of integers.\n\nThe Point class has 'name' (which is the node index) and friends as a map. In C, each Point struct would need to have a list of edges. Since in a tree, but the edges are undirected, so each node's friends list contains other nodes and their edge length. \n\nSo perhaps a Point struct can have an array of edges? Wait, but the number of edges varies. So better to have a linked list or array list for friends. Hmm, in C, perhaps each friend is represented as a struct, and linked in a list. Alternatively, use dynamic arrays with realloc. \n\nAlternatively, we can represent the friends as an adjacency list. Since the graph is a tree, it's manageable. So for each node, we can store a list of connected nodes along with the edge length.\n\nLet me think. Let's see how the Java code's Point.friends is used. Each entry has another Point (the friend) and an integer (the distance between them). So in C, each node (struct) will have a list of edges, where each edge is a pair (other node, length). Since nodes are identified by their \"name\" (index), perhaps we can store the list as a struct with node ID and length. \n\nAlternatively, since nodes are 0-based, using an array of linked lists. Let me plan the structs:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int neighbor;\n    int length;\n} Edge;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    Edge edges[];\n} Node;\n\nWait, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, each node can have an array of pointers to Edge structs.\n\nAlternatively, using adjacency lists via an array of lists. Since n can be up to... well, looking at the problem (probably from AtCoder, the code's name suggests it's for problem D of ABC126). Maybe n is up to 1e5? Not sure but in code, perhaps. Hmm, but for the code's sake, let's go for dynamic structure.\n\nAlternatively, in C, since it's a tree, we can represent each node's neighbors with a linked list. Each Edge is stored in a list. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, colors is an array of integers initialized to -1. The initial color is 0 (start at node 0 with 0 length). The DFS function does:\n\nCheck if the current node is already colored. If so, return. Else, set its color based on length parity. Then proceed recursively to all neighbors, adding their edge lengths to the current length.\n\nSo, in C:\n\n- The colors array is an int array size n. Initialize to -1.\n\n- The adjacency list: nodes are numbered 0..n-1. For each node, have an adjacency list of edges. Each edge has the neighbor node and edge length.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nWe can have an array of adjacency lists. Since in C, using array of pointers to arrays.\n\nWait, but maybe use a linked list approach. Alternatively, in C, it's common to use struct Edge:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int to; // the connected node's index\n    int length;\n    struct Edge *next;\n};\n\nThen, for each node, we'll have a pointer to the head of their edges. An array of Edge pointers for all nodes. Since each insertion would be adding to the head, but for traversal order doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, using dynamic arrays (like vectors in C) but that's more complex.\n\nLet me think of the approach:\n\n1. Read n, read m = n-1 edges. Each edge connects two nodes, and has a length. The graph is undirected, so for each edge between a and b, add to a's adjacency list to pointing to b with length, and vice versa.\n\n2. Then, perform DFS starting from node 0 with 0 length.\n\n3. For each node, when processing it, assign color based on current total length %2 (since even or odd).\n\nSo translating the DFS function in C.\n\nNow, let me tackle the data structures.\n\nFirst, in C, arrays are fixed size, so we need to:\n\nInitialize arrays for adjacency lists. Let's consider making an array of linked lists. So:\n\nDefine Edge struct:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int to;\n    int len;\n    struct Edge *next;\n} Edge;\n\nThen, an array of Edge pointers to point to each node's edge list. So Edge *adj[nodes]. \n\nAlso, variables:\n\n- int colors[n]; (but n is variable here, so we need to malloc that)\n\nWait, in the Java code, n is read from input first, so in C, we can first read n, then allocate arrays accordingly.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nInitialize colors as an array of size n, all set to -1. (using memset?)\n\nAdjacency lists: for each of the n nodes, have a linked list. So:\n\nEdge **adj;\nadj = malloc(n * sizeof(Edge *));\nThen for each node, adj[i] is initialized as NULL.\n\nThen when adding edges, for each edge between a and b and length l:\n\nInsert into adj[a] a new Edge with to = b, len = l, and next set to previous head.\n\nSame for adj[b].\n\nWait, but how to create nodes and edges? \n\nWait, in the code for adding edges in Java, it's done with:\n\npoints[me].becomeFriend(points[you], length);\npoints[you].becomeFriend(points[me], length);\n\nSo in Java, each Point has a map called friends which holds the other points and their edge lengths, so each undirected edge is stored both ways. In C, the adjacency list approach would store each edge in both directions.\n\nSo in C, after reading an edge, we need to add to both adjacency lists.\n\nOnce the input is read, we perform the DFS starting from node 0 and length 0.\n\nImplementing the DFS function:\n\nWe need to pass the current node (its index), the accumulated length. Wait, but in the Java code, the DFS function took a Point p. But in C, since we have an adjacency list, we can just pass the index of the node, and the current length.\n\nWait yes, because the adjacency list is of index (the \"name\" in the original code). \n\nSo the function might be:\n\nvoid dfs(int node, int length) {\n\nThen inside the function:\n\nCheck if colors[node] != -1. If yes, return.\n\nElse, set color based on even or odd.\n\nThen for each edge in adj[node], we can loop through all edges and call: next_edge's to and add length + edge->len.\n\nWait, so:\n\nfor each edge in adj[node]:\n\n    int next = edge->to;\n\n    int new_len = length + edge->len;\n\n    // proceed to dfs on next with new_len.\n\nThus, in the C code:\n\nThe function would look something like this:\n\nvoid dfs(int u, int current_length) {\n    if (colors[u] != -1) return;\n    colors[u] = (current_length % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1;\n    Edge* e = adj[u]; // e points to first Edge in list\n    while(e) {\n        int v = e->to;\n        int len = e->len;\n        dfs(v, current_length + len);\n        e = e->next;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, no: current_length is what has been built up so far. The length to the next node is added before passing along.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, first, the code structure:\n\nWe need to read n, then n-1 edges, build adjacency lists. Then call dfs on node 0 with 0 as starting length. \n\nThe DFS function has to be called recursively as in Java.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- What about when n is 1? Then m =0, and the only node's color is 0. \n\nNow, the steps for C:\n\nFirst, the code skeleton:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nThen the Edge struct as above.\n\nThen in main:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize colors array with n elements set to -1. colors can be allocated with malloc(n * sizeof(int)), initialized with memset.\n\nThe adjacency array adj is an array of pointers, each pointing to an Edge list. Start each to NULL.\n\nThen read the edges:\n\nfor (each of m = n-1 edges):\n\n    read a and b (but they are 1-based in input? Because in Java code, they do me = sc.nextInt() -1;. So the input is 1-based for nodes, we need to subtract 1 to get 0-based.\n\nThen read the length.\n\nThen for node a_me (a -1), and a_you (b-1).\n\nAdd edge from a_me to a_you with the length, and vice versa.\n\nAdding edges: to append to the list. Wait, the insertion can be done as adding a new Edge node.\n\nAlternatively, prepend to the list. So each Edge is created, and its next points to the current head, then the head is set to the new Edge.\n\nThis way:\n\nint me = a - 1;\n\nint you = b -1;\n\nint len = sc.nextInt();\n\nSo, when adding to adj[me]:\n\nEdge *new_edge = (Edge*)malloc(sizeof(Edge));\nnew_edge->to = you;\nnew_edge->len = len;\nnew_edge->next = adj[me];\nadj[me] = new_edge;\n\nThen do the same for adj[you].\n\nWait, but for each edge, you add two entries. One for me's adj and you's adj.\n\nThus, the code for adding each edge would be:\n\nAfter getting me, you, length:\n\nAdd entry to me's adjacency list pointing to you.\n\nAdd entry to you's adjacency list pointing to me with same length.\n\nThus, same as the Java code's addFriend twice.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow writing the actual code step by step.\n\nVariables:\n\nWill use pointers:\n\nIn main:\n\nint n, m;\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\nm = n-1;\n\nThen:\n\n// Allocate colors\nint *colors = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\nmemset(colors, -1, n * sizeof(int)); \n\nBut wait, in C, setting it with memset. Let me see.\n\nWait, since sizeof(int) is 4 bytes (assuming), the value -1 in each is 0xFFFFFFFF. But in memory, if the initial value is -1, then all bits are one. So perhaps better to loop through:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < n; i++) colors[i] = -1;\n\nAlternatively, since memset() sets the first byte for each int to -1. Wait no, because -1 in 32 bits is 0xFFFFFFFF, but if we memset to -1, which is all bits set to 1, then yes, it would set 0xFFFFFFFF for each int, which is equivalent to -1. So yes, that works.\n\nThen the adj:\n\nEdge **adj = malloc(n * sizeof(Edge *));\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    adj[i] = NULL;\n}\n\nThen read m edges (n-1 edges):\n\nfor (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n\n    int me, you, length;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &me, &you, &length);\n    me--;\n    you--;\n    // add doubly edges.\n    \n    Edge *new_edge = malloc(sizeof(Edge));\n    new_edge->to = you;\n    new_edge->len = length;\n    new_edge->next = adj[me]; // prepend\n    adj[me] = new_edge;\n    \n    new_edge = malloc( sizeof(Edge) );\n    new_edge->to = me;\n    new_edge->len = length;\n    new_edge->next = adj[you];\n    adj[you] = new_edge;\n}\n\nWait, that's the way to add them. \n\nThen proceed with tracing:\n\nThen call dfs(0, 0);\n\nWait, the Java code's dfs is called with the 0th node (starting node) and 0 length. \n\nThen, after the dfs, print out each colors array element.\n\nAfter that, free all allocated memory.\n\nWait, in C, we need to free all edges. So after printing, we have to traverse each adjacency list, free each edge.\n\nHmm, but perhaps in the code for the problem, this might be neglected for submission purposes (since it's a problem-solving code), but it's good practice to include.\n\nBut for the translation, perhaps the code can ignore freeing to keep it shorter, but better to manage it.\n\nBut let's focus on the core code first.\n\nThe dfs function:\n\nvoid dfs(int current_node, int current_length) {\n\n    if (colors[current_node] != -1)\n        return;\n    \n    colors[current_node] = (current_length %2 == 0 ? 0 :1);\n    \n    // loop through all edges in adj[current_node]\n    Edge *edge = adj[current_node];\n    \n    while (edge != NULL) {\n        int neighbor = edge->to;\n        int len = edge->len;\n        \n        dfs(neighbor, current_length + len);\n        edge = edge->next;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, yes, but the edge->len is the length from current_node to neighbor, so when moving to neighbor, the accumulated length should be current_length + edge->len. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, in Java code, for each entry in Entry<Point, Integer> entry, they have length2 = entry.getValue, which is the edge length. The next color is passing length+ length2. \n\nYes, so in the code above, when going to neighbor, it's:\n\ndfs(neighbor, current_length + (length from current to neighbor)).\n\nWait exactly.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\ntypedef struct Edge {\n    int to;\n    int len;\n    struct Edge *next;\n} Edge;\n\nvoid dfs(int current_node, int current_length, Edge **adj, int *colors);\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int m = n - 1;\n\n    int *colors = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    if (colors == NULL) {\n        // Error handling, but probably not needed here\n    }\n    memset(colors, -1, n * sizeof(int));\n\n    Edge **adj = (Edge **)malloc(n * sizeof(Edge *));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        adj[i] = NULL;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        int me, you, length;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &me, &you, &length);\n        me--;\n        you--;\n        // Add to adj[me]\n        Edge *new_edge = (Edge *)malloc(sizeof(Edge));\n        new_edge->to = you;\n        new_edge->len = length;\n        new_edge->next = adj[me];\n        adj[me] = new_edge;\n        // Add to adj[you]\n        new_edge = (Edge *)malloc(sizeof(Edge));\n        new_edge->to = me;\n        new_edge->len = length;\n        new_edge->next = adj[you];\n        adj[you] = new_edge;\n    }\n\n    dfs(0, 0, adj, colors);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", colors[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Free allocated memory\n    // First free edges in adjacency list.\n    for (int i =0; i<n; i++) {\n        Edge *current = adj[i];\n        while(current != NULL) {\n            Edge *next = current->next;\n            free(current);\n            current = next;\n        }\n    }\n    free(adj);\n    free(colors);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid dfs(int current_node, int current_length, Edge **adj, int *colors) {\n    if (colors[current_node] != -1) {\n        return;\n    }\n    colors[current_node] = (current_length % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1;\n    Edge *edge = adj[current_node];\n    while(edge != NULL) {\n        int neighbor = edge->to;\n        dfs(neighbor, current_length + edge->len, adj, colors); // pass parameters\n        edge = edge->next;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the 'colors' and 'adj' arrays need to be available in the function. Since the original Java code uses static variables, but in C, they are local to main, so need to pass them as parameters.\n\nAh right! So in the Java code, the 'colors' array is a static variable in the class. But in C, for the main function variables, to pass into the DFS function, they need to be passed through parameters.\n\nSo the dfs function has to have parameters for adj and colors, so in main, we call dfs(0, 0, adj, colors).\n\nYes, so the function definition and parameters are adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, in the code above, I defined dfs as taking the Edge** adj and the int* colors, which is correct.\n\nNow, in C function definitions, the arguments must be there. Hence the function is declared before main or defined after.\n\nAlternatively, in main, perhaps the function can be enclosed, but better to have function prototypes.\n\nYes, since main is in the code above, we can first declare the function:\n\nvoid dfs(int current_node, int current_length, Edge **adj, int *colors);\n\nThe code seems okay.\n\nNow, test possible issues:\n\nWhat about memory allocation for Edge?\n\nEach Edge gets allocated and added twice for each edge.\n\nTesting edge count:\n\nFor each edge entry added in both directions, the code handles that.\n\nThe main steps seem okay.\n\nAnother point: the current_length starts at 0, so node 0 is colored 0 correctly.\n\nSo when the first call to dfs(0, 0) is made. The colors are initialized as -1. So node 0's colors is set to 0, then edges are traversed.\n\nAnother possible issue is the Edge pointers in the DFS function. Since adj is an array of Edge*, passed as Edge **, the function can access it.\n\nNow, main differences from Java:\n\n- No object orientation, using structs and raw pointers.\n\n- The adjacency list is built with linked lists.\n\n- Handling of variables by passing pointers where needed.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nTest with n=1:\n\nThen m is 0 loops, so no edges read. The colors is [0], so output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nSuppose edges:\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2 with length 1, and 2-3 with length 2.\n\nWait nodes are input are 1-based in code.\n\nIf edges input like:\n\ninput lines:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3 4\n\nWait m is 2 (n-1 for n=3 m is 2). \n\nThen the structure would be built as such. The code should compute colors correctly.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe path:\n\nnode0 (0) has edges to 1 (from the first edge: 1 (input) converted to me=0, you=1, length3.\n\nWait, for first edge input of 1 2 3:\n\nme becomes 0, you becomes 1.\n\nAdding edge 0 <-> 1, length3.\n\nSecond edge is 2 and 3 (input 2 3 4). \n\nWait, nodes 2-3 here would be input as numbers. For m being 2 edges:\n\nWait perhaps another example is better.\n\nBut in any case, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible mistake: I have 'Edge **adj' as parameter to the dfs function. Since adj is a pointer to array of Edge* (the adjacency list), the function needs that to access each node's edges.\n\nThus the code should be correct.\n\nAnother mistake check: in the DFS code, the calling of neighbor's length is current_length, plus the edge's length. So that the accumulated length is passed correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nLooking at the Java code's 'length + length2' is exactly the same as 'current_length + edge->len'.\n\nThus, it should be correct.\n\nOverall, I think the code is correctly translated.\n\nNow, compiling may have some warnings if variables not initialized, but the code structure is correct."
