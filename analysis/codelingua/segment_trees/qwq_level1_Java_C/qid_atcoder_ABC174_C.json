We require N mod K ==0 \u2192 (10^{n} -1)/3 mod (K/(gcd(3,K))) ? Not sure.",

Wait wait wait, the code is returning ans as the solution for this scenario. So why would n=1 be acceptable when 3 divides by K=7? Yes, in the problem's original question. Wait the problem is K is the input. So in the problem where input was K=7, we need to find the minimal number made of 3's divisible by7. Which required n=6 (333333). But according to the code's logic, after processing K=7:\n\nThey divide by7 \u2192 K=1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 K=9. The code then finds n where 10^n \u22611 mod9, which is n=1, since 10 mod9=1 \u21d210^1 mod9 is 1. So 10^1 mod9 ==1 \u2192 the loop stops at ans=1. But the original problem required n such that 333... (n times) mod7 is0. But according to the code, it's returning 1 (which corresponds to n=1, but 3 mod7 is3 not divisible by7). This is a discrepancy. So perhaps the code is incorrect, or my analysis is wrong. Wait maybe I need to re-examine the code's approach. Wait in the code, after dividing K by7 (when divisible by7), then multiplied by9, let's think that K' = K *9 / something. Wait let's see:\n\nThe problem requires 10^n \u2261 1 mod (3*K) ? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again what the code is computing. Suppose the code is trying to find n where 3...3 (n digits) is divisible by K. The number 3..3 can be expressed as S(n) = 3*(10^{n}-1)/9. So,\n\nS(n) mod K = 0 \u2192 (10^{n}-1)/3 mod (K/(gcd(3, K))) should be 0, assuming K and 3? But this is getting complicated.

But actual answer should be 1. So again discrepancy. Hmm. This is getting me confused, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the code. Wait code's approach: after multiplying K by9, the new K is (K divided by7 if divisible) \u00d79 \u2192 let's see for K=3, then K'=3*9=27. The desired condition for the algorithm is to find n such that 10^n \u22611 mod27. The minimal such n is 3 (since 10^3 mod27=1), but the correct answer for the problem is \n\n1: because 3 is divisible by3. So clearly, the code's approach is giving wrong answer here, which indicates there's a mistake. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the code's logic. So what's going on? Maybe the code's formula is slightly off. Wait perhaps the code is seeking n such that 10^{n} ==1 mod (K\u653e\u677e something like it. Wait perhaps the K in the end should be (K\u4e58\u4ee5 some factors). Wait the problem requires S =33...3 (n digits) divisible by K \u2192 S = (10^n-1)*3/9 \u2192 (10^n-1)/3. So S must be divisible by K \u2192 10^n\u22121 \u22610 mod (3K) \u219210^n \u22611 mod (3K)\n\nProvided that GCD(10^n, 3K) divides 10^n \u22121. But we need the minimal n such that10^\u63a5\u53e3 mod(3K) is1. So the code's approach is to use modulus 3K? But then in that case, for K=7:\n\n3K =21.

The multiplicative order must divide \u03c6(21)=\u03c6(3)\u03c6(7)=2\u00d76=12. So possible divisors are 1,2,3,4,6, 12. Check 10^1 mod21=10, no.\n\n10^2 mod21=16, no.\n\n3: mod21=1 \u2192 no (earlier calculation said 10^3 mod21 was13. Did I compute that correctly?)

So the code's modulus is9, but the correct modulus here should be3*7=21. So the transformed K was made as (K has been divided by7 \u21929 is9\uff0c not 21. So it is. Because the code first divided by7, so if K=7 \u2192then divided by7 \u21921 \u2192 multiplied by9 \u2192 new K is9. So modulus 9.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me start by understanding what the code does.\n\nThe Java program is solving a problem where, given an integer K, it calculates the number of digits in the smallest number consisting of all 3's (like 3, 33, 333, etc.) that is divisible by K. If K is even or divisible by 5, it returns -1 because such numbers can't be formed by 3's in that case. The algorithm uses some modular arithmetic to find the minimal length.\n\nSo translating this to C. Let me think about each part.\n\nFirst, handling input and output. Java uses BufferedReader and PrintWriter, but in C, standard input and output will be through stdin and stdout, using functions like printf and scanf. But since this code reads tokens from the input efficiently, similar to Java's StringTokenizer, I might need to read the entire line and split it into tokens manually. Alternatively, using fscanf with stdin, but need to handle multiple tokens correctly.\n\nLooking at the readInt method in Java. It uses a StringTokenizer. But in C, perhaps the input is read line by line, and tokens are split on whitespace. The readInt function is designed to read integers one by one, reusing a string tokenizer. So perhaps in C, I can read a line into a string, split it into parts (maybe using strtok), and keep a global variable for the next token. Hmm, but since C doesn't have strings as easily handled as Java, this might require some setup.\n\nLet me consider the functions:\n\nIn Java:\n\nThe main function calls solve(), which does:\n\n- Check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen if divisible by 7, it divides by 7.\n\nThen K is multiplied by 9 (Wait why? Let me see. The logic in the solve function: Wait, K is divided by 7 first. Then multiplied by 9.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mathematical approach here. The problem requires finding the minimal n where 333...3 (n times) is divisible by K. The number 333...3 is equal to (10^n -1)/3 * 3? Or maybe 3*(10^{n} -1)/9, so it's (10^n -1)/3. Wait, to have that divisible by K, maybe after some factorization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is following a certain algorithm. Let me see:\n\nThe problem requires that 333...3 (with n digits) is divisible by K. Let's represent that number as N = 3 * (10^{n} - 1)/9. So N must be divisible by K.\n\nSo 3*(10^n -1)/9 divisible by K => 10^n \u2261 1 mod (anything? Let's think modulo (K* something). Maybe the code has a different approach here.\n\nWait the code's solve function seems to process K by first checking if it's even or divisible by 5 \u2192 returns -1 because such K can't divide a number made of 3's since those numbers don't end with even/0 or 5.\n\nThen, if divisible by 7, divide K by 7. Then multiply by 9. Hmm, why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code handles the case where K must have to satisfy certain conditions. Let me think:\n\nThe code explanation:\n\nSuppose K is not even or divisible by 5. Then, after dividing by 7 (if needed?), and then set K' = K *9 ?\n\nWait the logic in code:\n\nWait original code's logic:\n\n1. K is read.\n\n2. If K mod 2 ==0 or mod5 ==0 \u2192 output -1.\n\n3. If K mod 7 is 0 \u2192 K is divided by 7 (so K becomes K/7).\n\nWait why? Because 333 is divisible by 7, perhaps. For example, 333 divided by 7 \u2192 333%7 is 333/7 is 47. So 333 mod7 is 333-47*7= 333 - 329=4 \u2192 4. Not sure why dividing by 7. Maybe the code's logic is addressing some step.\n\nWait the code then after possibly dividing by7, multiplies K by9 to get new K*M? Not sure. Let me see the rest:\n\nThe next steps are:\n\nans initialized to 1.\n\nremainder starts as 10 mod K \u2192 remainder = (10%K). Then, loops until remainder is 1. Every time, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K. The loop stops when remainder is 1, returning the ans.\n\nWait, so the loop is looking for the minimal n where 10^n mod (new K) \u22611?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The code does:\n\nOld comments:\n\nThe solve() function:\n\nAfter K is divided by 7 (if it was divisible by7 first), then multiplied by 9? Wait no: in the code, after checking if K is divisible by7, it divides by7. Then code does K *=9? So:\n\nWait original code:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7;   (K divided by7)\n\nThen K *=9. So the new K is (original K divided by7 if needed) multiplied by9. Wait that might be part of the mathematical process here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's solution is to find the minimal n where 333...3 is divisible by K.\n\nSo the number N is 3*(10^{n} -1)/9 \u2192 333...3 (n times).\n\nSo this N must be divisible by K \u2192 so (10^n -1)/9 must be divisible by K/3 (since N = 3 * (...)), so if 3 divides K, then K/3 must divide (10^n-1)/9. Wait, but this requires the problem's constraints, which perhaps the code is handling.\n\nAlternatively, the modular condition.\n\nWait the code's method after multiplicative steps:\n\nThey have an equation: 333...3 (n times) = 3*K*M \u2192 but perhaps the approach is to find n where 10^n \u22611 mod (something).\n\nWait maybe the code uses modular inverses. The code's solve function seems to be trying to find the smallest n where 10^n \u22611 mod (K_new), where K_new is (K*9) after some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K', where K' is (something).\n\nLet me see the code's steps again:\n\nThe code first checks that K isn't even or divisible by5. So K has factors only 3,7, etc. (since 3*7=21, but maybe other primes not 2 or 5).\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, they divide it by7. Then K is multiplied by9. Let me think why.\n\nMaybe K becomes newK = (K *9)/7? Not sure, but I think the algorithm requires setting up some terms so that the answer is the minimal n where (10^(n) \u22611 mod newK).\n\nBecause then the remainder = 10 mod newK, then after multiplying by 10 each step, remainder cycles until it loops back to 1. The number of steps is the n to return.\n\nWait let me see the steps with example values. Let's take a test case where K is 7. Let's see:\n\nInput K=7. So, K is not even or divisible by5 \u2192 proceed.\n\nCheck K %7 ==0 \u2192 yes, so K becomes 1.\n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 new K is 9. Wait so new K=7*? Wait original K was divided by7, so 7 \u2192 divide by7=>1, then multiplied by9 becomes 9.\n\nThen the code computes remainder=10 mod 9 is 1? Because 10 mod9 is 1. So ans starts at 1, because immediately remainder is 1. So ans is 1, which is correct. The number is 3 (digits 1) \u2192 3 divisible by7? 3/7 is not. Wait that's a problem. Wait perhaps my analysis is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think: if K is 7,\n\nThe code processes:\n\nInput K=7 \u2192 not divisible by2 or5.\n\nCheck K%7 ==0 \u2192 yes. K becomes 7/7 =1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThe code then computes remainder=10 mod9 \u21921. Since remainder ==1, ans is 1. But the minimal n for which 3 (the 1-digit number) is divisible by 7? 3/7 is 0.428... so no. Wait that's an issue. But 3 is not divisible by 7, but according to the code's logic, it's returning 1, which is wrong? So perhaps I misunderstood the algorithm here.\n\nHmm maybe I made an error. Let me take a concrete example where the correct n should be?\n\nFor K=7: the problem is find the smallest n where 33...3 (n times) is divisible by 7.\n\n3 \u21923 mod7? 3.\n\n33 \u219233 mod7 \u2192 33/7 is 4.714, 4*7=28 \u2192 rem is5.\n\n333 \u2192333 mod7 \u2192333-7*47 =333- 329=4.\n\n3333 \u21923333 mod7: 3333 =7*476= 3332 \u2192 rem 1. Not.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n3 \u2192 3 mod7 \u21923\n\n33 \u2192 33 mod7 \u2192 33 mod7: 7*4=28 \u219233-28=5.\n\n333 mod7: 5*10 +3 =53 mod7: 53-7*7=53-49=4 \u2192 53 mod7 is4 \u2192 so 333 \u21924 mod7.\n\nAdding another digit: 533 (3333?) Wait let me think step by step:\n\nWait n=4 \u21923 3 3 3 \u2192 3333 mod7:\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nThe number is 3 (digit 1) \u21923 mod7 \u21923.\n\nAdding next digit: 33 \u2192 (3*10 +3) mod7 \u2192 (30+3)=33 mod7 \u21925.\n\nAdding next digit \u2192 (33 *10 +3) mod7 \u21925*10+3=50+3=53 mod7 \u219253 mod7. 7*7=49, so 53-49=4 \u21924 mod7.\n\nFourth digit: (4 *10 +3) mod7 \u219240+3=43 mod7 \u219243 - 6*7= 43-42=1 \u21921 mod7. So 3333 mod7 is 1 mod7 \u2192 not 0. So remainder 1, but n=4.\n\nWait looking for remainder of the number mod7 equal to 0.\n\nWait the code is trying to get remainder 1 for the modulus (newK) which is 9 (since K was divided by7 then multiplied by9, leading to 9). Wait, but the problem here with K=7:\n\nThe code returned 1, but the actual n for K=7 is?\n\nLet me check when 33...3 is divisible by7. Trying n=6: let me compute 333333 mod7. Let's compute step by step:\n\n1. n=1 \u21923 mod7 \u21923 \u2192 not 0.\n\nn=2 \u219233 mod7 =5 \u2192 no.\n\nn=3 \u2192333 mod7 is4 \u2192No.\n\nn=4 \u21923333 \u2192 mod7 is1 \u2192 no.\n\nn=5: (1*10 +3)=13 mod7 \u2192 remainder 6 \u2192 So after n=5, the number mod7 is6?\n\nWait let me recompute for n=4, which gave remainder 1:\n\nThen for n=5:\n\nThe remainder when building the number mod7:\n\nAt step 4, remainder was 1 mod7 (the number is3333). Adding another 3 would be (1 *10 +3) \u219213 mod7 is6.\n\nSo mod7: the number after 5 digits is 6 mod7.\n\nn=6: (6*10 +3) mod7 \u219263 mod7 \u219263 is 7*9 \u2192 0 mod7. So 6digits:333333 mod7 is0. So n=6. Wait so the correct answer is 6 for K=7, but according to the code, when K=7:\n\nLet me walk through the code step by step here:\n\nStarting K is7.\n\nFirst condition (if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 no.\n\nThen, since K %7==0, divide K by7 \u21921. Then K *=9: \u2192 9.\n\nThe code now processes K=9.\n\nThe loop starts:\n\nans=1, remainder=10 mod9 \u21921. Because 10 mod9 is1.\n\nSo remainder is already 1, so the loop exits \u2192ans is 1, which is wrong. So that suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the code's algorithm.\n\nBut that contradicts the example. Wait the actual correct answer for K=7 is 6, but according to code's logic here, the code would return 1, which is wrong. So my analysis must be wrong.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I misunderstood why the code is doing what it does.\n\nWait maybe I made an error in converting the problem's K to some other K'.\n\nLet me re-express the problem's mathematical formulation again. The problem wants the minimal n where 3*(10^{n} -1)/9 is divisible by K. Let me denote that as:\n\nLet N = 3*(10^n -1)/9.\n\nWe require N mod K ==0 \u2192 (10^{n} -1)/3 mod (K/(gcd(3,K))) ? Not sure. Alternatively, rearranged:\n\nN is divisible by K \u21923*(10^n-1)/9 divisible by K \u2192 (10^n-1)/3 divisible by K \u219210^n \u22611 mod 3K? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps to make it divisible by K, (10^n -1) must be divisible by 3*K / gcd(3,K).\n\nAlternatively, 10^n \u22611 mod (some multiple). Hmm, the code's variable K' after processing is:\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn code:\n\nThe code checks if K is divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 returns -1.\n\nThen, if K divisible by 7 \u2192 K = K /7.\n\nThen, K *=9.\n\nWait, perhaps the final K' used in the modulo is (K * 9), where K was divided by7 first.\n\nWait in the first case K =7:\n\nAfter divide by7 \u2192 K becomes1. After multiply by9 \u2192 K is9.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the smallest n where 10^n \u22611 mod (K=9). Because the remainder is remainder =10 mod (9)=1, which is already present. So in the loop, remainder ==1 \u2192ans is1.\n\nThe answer here would be 1. But in reality, for K=7 the actual answer is 6, which makes me think perhaps the code is wrong, or my understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait wait wait, the code is returning ans as the solution for this scenario. So why would n=1 be acceptable when 3 divides by K=7? Yes, in the problem's original question.\n\nWait the problem is K is the input. So in the problem where input was K=7, we need to find the minimal number made of 3's divisible by7. Which required n=6 (333333). But according to the code's logic, after processing K=7:\n\nThey divide by7 \u2192 K=1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 K=9. The code then finds n where 10^n \u22611 mod9, which is n=1, since 10 mod9=1 \u21d210^1 mod9 is 1.\n\nSo 10^1 mod9 ==1 \u2192 the loop stops at ans=1.\n\nBut the original problem required n such that 333... (n times) mod7 is0. But according to the code, it's returning 1 (which corresponds to n=1, but 3 mod7 is3 not divisible by7). This is a discrepancy. So perhaps the code is incorrect, or my analysis is wrong.\n\nWait maybe I need to re-examine the code's approach.\n\nWait in the code, after dividing K by7 (when divisible by7), then multiplied by9, let's think that K' = K *9 / something.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe problem requires 10^n \u2261 1 mod (3*K) ?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me think again what the code is computing.\n\nSuppose the code is trying to find n where 3...3 (n digits) is divisible by K. The number 3..3 can be expressed as S(n) = 3*(10^{n}-1)/9.\n\nSo,\n\nS(n) mod K = 0 \u2192 (10^{n}-1)/3 mod (K/(gcd(3, K))) should be 0, assuming K and 3?\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Perhaps the code uses some transformation.\n\nThe code first checks whether K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 returns -1 since any such number can\u2019t end with even digits or zero/divisible by5 (since all 3's). So that part is correct.\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, divide it by 7. Wait why?\n\nWait in the problem statement, perhaps if the original problem allows when K has a factor which requires more steps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct and my earlier example was wrong.\n\nWait when K=7:\n\nThe code returns 1, implying the number 3 is divisible by7? Which it's not. So the code must be wrong?\n\nThat can\u2019t be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the code's steps.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait let me see the code's solve function again:\n\nThe code has:\n\nAfter K is divided by7 (if needed), then multiplies by9.\n\nWait let me re-express the code steps:\n\nOriginal K is 7.\n\nAfter division by7: becomes 1.\n\nThen K *=9 \u21929.\n\nThe remainder is 10 mod9 \u21921. Since remainder is already 1, so loop ends, return ans=1.\n\nThus the code would return 1 for input K=7. But the correct answer is 6. So that's a problem. So perhaps the code is incorrect?\n\nWait, but perhaps there's confusion between K and the transformed K. Let me see:\n\nThe remainder is initialized to 10 mod K (transformed K).\n\nSo transformed K here is9. The remainder is 10 mod9 \u21921 mod9 is1. So n is1.\n\nBut in this case, the result is that the code is wrong. Or perhaps the code is correct but my understanding of the code is incorrect?\n\nMaybe I have the problem statement wrong. The problem says the minimal n where the number with n 3's is divisible by K. For K=7, the correct minimal n is 6. The code computes 1 which is wrong. So why?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is actually computing something else. Let me think of correcting the code's steps.\n\nWait perhaps the code's variable ans counts one less? Or the K transformation is wrong.\n\nWait let me see the algorithm:\n\nThe code's loop starts with ans=1 and remainder = 10 mod K.\n\nEach iteration:\n\nans increases by 1?\n\nWait no. Let's look:\n\nThe code:\n\nremainder is initialized to 10 mod K.\n\nThen while (remainder !=1 ):\n\n   ans++;\n\n   remainder = (remainder *10 ) % K.\n\nWait the loop continues until remainder is 1.\n\nThe loop increases ans each time until the remainder is 1. The initial ans is 1, and if the first remainder is 1, then ans remains 1.\n\nWait so for K'=9:\n\nremainder starts at1 \u2192 loop condition is false \u2192 so ans is1.\n\nThe code would output 1 as answer. But according to the problem's scenario, this is wrong for K=7.\n\nSo this suggests that either the code is wrong or my translation is incorrect, but since I'm supposed to translate the code given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I made a mistake.\n\nWait wait wait, let me think of the transformed K.\n\nThe transformed K is 7 divided by7 \u21921 \u2192 then multiplied by9 \u21929.\n\nSo, the code reduces the problem to finding n such that 10^n \u22611 mod K' (where K' is9). Here, K'=9. The minimal n here is 1, since 10^1 mod9 equals1. But the actual K was 7. So the algorithm must relate to this K' such that if this holds, then the original number of 3's is divisible by K?\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe transformed K' (after dividing by7 and mult by9) is9. Then the answer is n=1.\n\nSo what is the original number here?\n\nThe original K is7, so the code returns1 and expects that the number made with 1 '3's (3) is divisible by7 \u2192 but it's not.\n\nHmm. So this indicates a problem with the code. Or perhaps the code is based on a different approach.\n\nAlternatively maybe I'm misunderstanding the mathematical relation.\n\nLet me look back at the code: solve function.\n\nVariables:\n\nans starts at1, remainder is 10 mod K (where K is the new K after dividing by7 and multiplied by9?)\n\nSo perhaps the variable K after processing is used to compute for 10^{n} mod (newK) ==1 ?\n\nBut what's the relationship between the old K and that?\n\nWait let me think of the number 3*\u2026*3 n times: which is S = 3*(10^n -1)/9.\n\nThe code wants to find the smallest n such that S mod K ==0.\n\nWhich is equivalent to (10^n -1)/3 mod (K / gcd(3,K)) must be divisible by (K/gcd(3,K)).\n\nAlternatively, 10^n \u2261 1 mod 3K\u2019 (if we factor out the 3).\n\nSo if K and3 are coprime, then 3 divides S \u2192 but it already does.\n\nWait perhaps the idea is to rewrite the congruence condition.\n\nLet me suppose that S = (10^n -1)/3 * 3 = (10^n -1) * 1.\n\nWait, S = 3 * ( (10)^n -1 )/9 \u2192 S = (10^n -1)/3.\n\nSo for S divisible by K \u2192 (10^n -1)/3 must be divisible by K \u2192 so 10^n \u22611 mod (3*K).\n\nExcept if 3 divides K in a certain way.\n\nWait maybe 10^m \u22611 mod 3*K, but need to see:\n\nSuppose that K and 3 are coprime (since if not, then 3 divides K, so the equation is 10^n \u22611 mod K s*3, but perhaps not). This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively the code's approach is to compute for the transformed K', which is K divided by7 then multiplied by9, and the required n found through their modular computation.\n\nWait the code's K transformation is:\n\noriginal K \u2192 K divided by7 (if divisible by7, then done), then multiplied by9.\n\nThe resulting K' is the modulus for the multiplicative order of 10.\n\nWait in the case K=7 \u2192 K becomes 7//7 *9 = 9. So the modular order of 10 mod9 is indeed 1. But in the original problem, the number with 1 digit is 3 \u2192 not divisible by7. Hmm. \n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the multiplication by 9 is divided by something else. Like the code has K /=7 and then K *=9, but the transformation should be different.\n\nAh! in code: \n\nThe code does:\n\nif( K %7 ==0 ) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nWait that's the value of K now. So, the new modulus is K': = (K divided by7 if divisible by7) * 9.\n\nThe answer found is the minimal n where 10^n mod (newK) == 1. And suppose that:\n\nnewK = (K / (any factors of 7? No\u2014divided once if divisible by7)) *9\n\nThis seems to be part of the logic not directly evident.\n\nPerhaps the code is attempting to find n such that 3*(10^n-1)/9 mod K =0 \u2192 so 10^n -1 divisible by 3K \u2192 10^n \u22611 mod 3K.\n\nSo we are to find the smallest n where 10^n \u22611 mod (3*K).\n\nUnless there are common factors.\n\nWait, but 3 and K may share factors.\n\nWait, for example, K might be divisible by 3, let's say: suppose K is3, then we want 10^n \u22611 mod 9 \u2192 but 10 mod9 =1, so 1^anything is 1 mod9: so n=1 is the solution. Original problem: 3 mod3 =0. So the answer would be 1. Which is correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the required condition is 10^n \u22611 mod (3*K /GCD(3,K) ? Not sure. Wait let me check this case.\n\nExample K=3:\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal n where 3's repeated n times is divisible by3. The smallest is 1 (since 3 is divisible by3. So yes. The code should return1. Let see with code:\n\nK=3 \u2192 no even or divisible by5 \u2192 continue.\n\nCheck for divisible by7? No. So K stays 3 \u2192 multiply by9 \u2192 K' =3*9=27.\n\nThe new K'=27 \u2192 find n where 10^n mod27 ==1.\n\nWhat is 10 mod27 \u219210, 10^2 mod27 is 19, 10^3 \u2192190 mod27: 27*7=189 \u21921 \u2192 10^3 mod27 is1. So n=3?\n\nWait code would return ans=3. But actual answer should be 1. So again discrepancy.\n\nHmm. This is getting me confused, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the code.\n\nWait code's approach: after multiplying K by9, the new K is (K divided by7 if divisible) \u00d79 \u2192 let's see for K=3, then K'=3*9=27.\n\nThe desired condition for the algorithm is to find n such that 10^n \u22611 mod27.\n\nThe minimal such n is 3 (since 10^3 mod27=1), but the correct answer for the problem is \n\n1: because 3 is divisible by3. So clearly, the code's approach is giving wrong answer here, which indicates there's a mistake.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I misunderstood the code's logic. So what's going on?\n\nMaybe the code's formula is slightly off. \n\nWait perhaps the code is seeking n such that 10^{n} ==1 mod (K\u653e\u677e something like it. Wait perhaps the K in the end should be (K\u4e58\u4ee5 some factors).\n\nWait the problem requires S =33...3 (n digits) divisible by K \u2192 S = (10^n-1)*3/9 \u2192 (10^n-1)/3.\n\nSo S must be divisible by K \u2192 10^n\u22121 \u22610 mod (3K) \u219210^n \u22611 mod (3K)\n\nProvided that GCD(10^n, 3K) divides 10^n \u22121.\n\nBut we need the minimal n such that10^\u63a5\u53e3 mod(3K) is1. \n\nSo the code's approach is to use modulus 3K?\n\nBut then in that case, for K=7:\n\n3K =21. So we need the minimal n where10^n mod21 ==1.\n\n10 mod21 is10. 10^2 mod21 is 100 mod21 \u2192 100-4*21=100-84=16.\n\n10^3 mod21 is 16*10 mod21 \u2192160 mod21 = 160-7*21=160-147=13.\n\n10^4: 13*10 mod21 \u2192130 mod21 \u2192130-6*21=8 \u2192 8 mod21\n\n10^5 \u219280 mod21 \u219280-3*21= 80-63=17 mod21.\n\n10^6 \u2192 mod21 \u2192170 mod21: 170 - 8\u00d721=170 - 168=2 mod21.\n\n10^7 mod21 \u21922*10 mod21 \u219220 mod21.\n\n10^8 \u2192200 mod21 \u2192 200 mod21 = 200-9\u00d721 \u2192200-189=11.\n\n10^9 mod21 11\u00d710=110 mod21 \u2192110-5\u00d721=110-105=5 mod21.\n\n10^10 \u219250 mod21 \u219250 mod21=8.\n\nContinuing until 10^25... Wait this takes time. Or perhaps there is a better way.\n\nAlternatively\uff0c the multiplicative order of 10 mod21.\n\nThe multiplicative order must divide \u03c6(21)=\u03c6(3)\u03c6(7)=2\u00d76=12. So possible divisors are 1,2,3,4,6, 12.\n\nCheck 10^1 mod21=10, no.\n\n10^2 mod21=16, no.\n\n3: mod21=1 \u2192 no (earlier calculation said 10^3 mod21 was13. Did I compute that correctly?)\n\nYes: 10^3: 10\u00d710\u00d710 =1000 \u2192 but mod21: 10\u00d710 mod21 first \u219210^2 mod21 is16. Then 16 \u00d710 mod21 =160 \u2192160 mod21 \u2192160-147 (7\u00d721) \u219213 \u2192 yes. So 10^3 mod21=13, not 1.\n\nSo try at 6 steps:\n\n10^4's mod is8.\n\n10^6 \u2192 2 mod21.\n\nLooking for the first time to hit1.\n\n10^ 6 \u21922 mod21.\n\n10^5 \u2192 let me compute for n=6, what's 10^6 mod21 = 10^(5) \u00d710 mod21 \u219210^5 was 17 \u219217*10=170 mod21 \u2192 170-8\u00d721=170-168=2. So that'\u5219 standard.\n\nNow 10^10 is:\n\nLet me see n=26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is 6 mod 21? No.\n\nHmm. This implies that for K=7 \u2192 desired n is the multiplicative order of10 mod3*K (21) \u2192 which is perhaps 6? Or perhaps 6?\n\nWait let's compute 10^6 mod21: 10^6 mod21 equals 10 mod21 repeatedly ^6:\n\nBut earlier step gave 10^6 mod21 is2 \u2192 no. Perhaps the order doesn't exist here?\n\nThat would mean it's impossible, but in reality, for K=7, the answer must exist since333333 is divisible by7.\n\nBut 333333 mod21 \u2192 333333 is divisible by7, but 21's factors include3. \n\n333333 divided by3 \u2192111111 \u2192 divisible by7? 333333/7=47619, so yes. \n\nSo333333 mod21 is0, which is 10^6 mod21 \u22612 mod21 \u2192 wait no, the code's required condition would be 10^6 \u22611 mod21, but it gives2, so that condition would not hold. \n\nBut the actual required condition for the original problem is 10^6 \u22611 mod3K.\n\nFor the original problem to have n=6 \u219210^6 \u22611 mod21?\n\nBut according to calculation it's 2 mod21.\n\nWait does 10^6 mod21 \u2261 10\u76846\u6b21 mod21 equals?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n10^1 mod21=10\n\n10^2=100 mod21 \u2192100-4\u00d721=100-84=16.\n\n10^3:16\u00d710=160 mod21 \u2192 160-7\u00d721=160-147=13. \n\n10^4:13\u00d710=130 mod21 \u2192130-6\u00d721=130-126=4.\n\n10^5:4\u00d710=40 mod21 \u219240-2\u00d721=40-42\u2192 -2 \u2192mod21 \u219219?\n\nAh sorry, 40 mod21 is40-2*21=40-42= -2 \u2192 mod21, that's 19?\n\nWait 21\u00d71 is 21. 40-21=19 \u2192 yes \u2192 mod21 is19 \u2192\u9519\u8bef\u4e4b\u524d\u3002 \n\nThen:\n\n10^5 mod21 =19.\n\n10^6 mod21:19\u00d710 mod21 \u2192190 mod21. \n\n21*9=189 \u2192190-189=1 \u2192 yes! \n\nAh I made a mistake earlier. \n\nYes: 10^5 mod21 is (10^4's mod21 is4, then 4 \u00d710 =40 mod21 =19.\n\nThen 10^6 is19*10 mod21 =190 mod21 \u2192190-9\u00d721\u2192190-189=1 mod21. \n\nSo indeed. The multiplicative order is6. So for K=7 (the initial K) the code would compute the transformed K as (7/7)*9=9. But the code uses K\u4e58\u4ee5 to9. So the code's modulus is9, but the correct modulus here should be3*7=21. So the transformed K was made as (K has been divided by7 \u21929 is9\uff0c not 21. So it is.\n\n\nBecause the code first divided by7, so if K=7 \u2192then divided by7 \u21921 \u2192 multiplied by9 \u2192 new K is9. So modulus 9. So the multiplicative order of10 mod9 is1\uff0c since10 mod9=1. so the code loops stops with ans=1. So the code returns1. But the actual correct n is6. \n\n\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u3002 \n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding. Maybe the problem requires that K cannot be even or divisible by5, which the code does check. In this K=7 case, it returns1, which is wrong, but this suggests the code is incorrect. But maybe in the original problem, the code is correct and my test case is wrong?\n\n\u6216\u8005 perhaps I misunderstand the code\u3002 Let me see the code: the final return is ans , so in K=7\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c code\u8fd4\u56de1, which the problem wants the count of \"3\"\u7684 digits is n=1, which is3 mod7 nonzero. So this is wrong. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the code is incorrect. But since the user asked to translate the code, I have to proceed even if there is a possible mistake.\n\nNow, coming back to the task: translating the given Java code to C.\n\nThe major task is to \n\n1. Implement the reading of integers efficiently.\n\n2. Replicate the solve function's logic in C.\n\nIn C:\n\nThe code structure will be different. Need to read from stdin, process it, and return the solution.\n\nFirst, the main function will read K integer, compute the solve function\u8fd4\u56de\u503c, print it.\n\nImplementing readInt function: the Java code uses a static tokenizer which might have been designed for multiple token accesses. Perhaps in C, we can read the entire line into buffer, then use sscanf etc.\n\nAlternatively, using sscanf\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bfb\u4e00\u4e2a number, but in this scenario, the code only reads one integer per line. The solve function reads K via readInt() once.\n\nThe main part is the solve function:\n\nThe solve\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n- \u8bfb\u53d6\u4e00\u4e2a K\u7684\u503c.\n\n- \u5982\u679cK is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\n- \u5982\u679c K is divisible by7 \u2192 divide it by7.\n\n- multiply by9 \u2192 new K is K assigned as K /=7 then multiplied by9.\n\n-\u7136\u540e, compute the minimal n where remainder of multiplying 10 mod\u65b0K\u5faa \u7ef4 1.\n\nThe loop is:\n\nans starts at1.\n\nremainder is 10%K' newK. \n\nwhile remainder !=1:\n\n    ans ++\n\n    remainder = (remainder *10) % newK\n\nLoop ends,\u8fd4\u56de ans.\n\nNow, the data types. The K can be up to what? Well, as the problem is acm programming problem, perhaps K is up to 1e9 f type, so as long as C's int can handle it. \n\nBut in the code's \"solve\" function:\n\n\u4e58\u4ee59 may make it higher. Suppose K could be up to 1e9, then 3e9 would exceed 2^31-1 (int in C). Thus may need to use long long (64-bit).\n\nSo in C, we need to ensure the data types are sufficient. Probably using \n\nint64_t.\n\nThe code:\n\nNow, the steps in C:\n\nImplement:\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c the readInt function is needed. In java, read from a \" ()\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bfb\u53d6\u6574\u4e2a\u884c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u62c6\u5206\u6210 token. \u56e0\u4e3a the input is only one integer in this case (the main function reads K once), the readInt() will be called once, so maybe in C, we can simply use scanf.\n\nWait, in the Java's code, the readInt() is optimized to pre-parse tokens. So in this case, the problem has the main function only reads one integer K.\n\nThus, in C, we can just use:\n\nint k = scanf, but code will be:\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\n    int k;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", solve(k));\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nBut the solve function's code:\n\nSo the problem is mainly in coding the solve function.\n\nBut also the initialization of K.\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nfunction\u8fd4\u56de an int, but K could be up to large values?\n\nThe steps:\n\nInside solve function (taking K as an argument):\n\n int solve(int K) {\n\n    if (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0)\n\n        return -1;\n\n    if (K%7 ==0) {\n\n        K /=7;\n\n    }\n\n    K *=9;\n\n    int ans=1;\n\n    int remainder = (10 % K);\n\n    while(remainder !=1){\n\n        ans++;\n\n        remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait wait. That's the code's logic translated to C.\n\nWait converting the Java code's solve method into a C function.\n\nWait, in the original code:\n\nThe K is manipulated by division and multiplication in place. So the K variable is modified in function's scope. So in the C function, when passed as a parameter, we should make local copies.\n\nYes.\n\nWait the function:\n\nint solve(int k_input) {\n\n    int K =k_input;\n\n    if (....) etc.\n\n}\n\nSo in C:\n\nThe function signature will be:\n\nint solve(int K_input) {\n\n   int K = K_input;\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nAlternatively, using ptr, but perhaps straightforward.\n\nThus, the code translation is almost direct except for the handling of the input.\n\nThus the full C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint solve(int K_input) {\n\n    int K = K_input;\n\n    if (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\n    if (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\n    K *=9;\n\n    int ans =1;\n\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n\n    while (remainder !=1) {\n\n        ans++;\n\n        remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    int K;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", solve(K));\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait but wait: in the Java code, the readInt\u51fd\u6570 \u662f:\n\nIt reads a token each time. But in this case, the code only requires reading once. The C code is straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires reading from a stream with multiple tokens, but for this problem's case (the solve function iscalled once with single K, yes, So the above C code should work.\n\nTesting the test case where K is7:\n\nThe code's solve function would return1. \u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d, correct answer should be6. \n\nHowever, this is the\u4ea4\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5373 they asked to translate the Java code into C, so even if the original code has mistakes, the task is to translate it.\n\nThus the above C code is correct translation of the given Java code.\n\nWait, but in\u4ee3\u7801\u7684solve\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c \u662fK\u8f93\u5165\uff1a\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8eK=7:\n\nsolve(7)\uff1a\n\n\u6b65\u9aa4:\n\nK is7.\n\n\u68c0\u67e5 whether even or divisible by5 \u2192 no.\n\n\u68c0\u67e5 if divisible by7 \u2192\u662f\u7684\u3002 so K divided by7 \u21921.\n\n\u7136\u540e multiply by9 \u2192 becomes9.\n\n the remainder is 10%9 \u21921.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5 the loop is not executed, return ans is1.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5 the\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684 C\u4ee3\u7801 is correct as per the Java's logic.\n\nEven though that leads to incorrect answer for the case K=7, but that's the original code's logic.\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c the desired\u7ffb\u8bd1 is the above C\u4ee3\u7801."
