So we can do:\n\n        character(len=n) :: s\n        read(*,*) s\n\n   Then we have the first n characters of the token? But if the token is exactly n, then we get the whole token.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The first Java program (codeforces_632_B) does:\n   - Reads an integer `n`\n   - Reads an array `a` of `n` integers\n   - Reads a string `s` of length `n`\n   - Computes an initial sum `sum` for which the character in `s` is 'B'\n   - Then does two passes (forward and backward) to compute a maximum value `ans`\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_ABC170_A) does:\n   - Reads a line of space-separated strings\n   - Counts the position (1-indexed) of the first occurrence of \"0\" and outputs that position.\n\n However, note that the second program does not use the output of the first program.\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let's analyze the outputs and inputs:\n   - The first program outputs a single integer (ans).\n   - The second program expects a line of space-separated strings.\n\n This suggests that the output of the first program (a single integer) becomes the input to the second program.\n The second program expects a line of space-separated strings. However, the first program outputs just one integer.\n\n How to reconcile?\n The second program counts the position of the first \"0\" in the input array of strings.\n\n But note: the output of the first program is a single integer. So the second program will read a single string (that integer) and then break immediately because it will see that the string is not \"0\", but then it will break only when it finds \"0\". Actually, the second program is written to break when it finds a \"0\", and then output the count (which is the 1-indexed position).\n\n However, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a single integer. So the array of strings in the second program will be one string: the string representation of that integer.\n\n Example: if the first program outputs 10, then the second program will read the string \"10\". Then it will split and get an array of one element: [\"10\"]. Then it iterates:\n   result = 0\n   first element: result becomes 1, then check if \"10\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> continue? but there's only one element.\n   Then it breaks the loop? Actually, the break only happens when it finds \"0\". Since it doesn't find \"0\", it will just count the number of elements? Then output 1? \n\n But that's not what the second program is intended to do. The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) is intended to solve:\n   \"You are given five integers. Find the index (1-indexed) of the first zero.\"\n\n However, in the chain, the input to the second program is a single integer. So we have a mismatch.\n\n But note the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n How should we interpret the chain?\n   Step 1: The first program reads an input (n, then array a of n integers, then string s of n characters).\n   Step 2: The first program outputs a single integer (ans).\n   Step 3: The second program reads a line of space-separated integers (but in this chain, the input is the output of the first program, which is one integer). Then the second program outputs the position of the first zero in that line.\n\n However, the second program in the original (if run standalone) would read 5 integers? But in the chain, it reads one integer.\n\n This suggests that the chain is not consistent. But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n We have two possibilities:\n   1. The chain is as described: first program runs and outputs one integer, then that integer is the entire input to the second program.\n   2. The problem might have intended the second program to be run with the original input that the first program had? But that is not stated.\n\n Since the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\", we must consider the actual flow of data.\n\n However, the two programs are independent? The second program does not use the output of the first? Actually, it does: the second program reads from standard input, which in the chain is the standard output of the first.\n\n Therefore, the chain would be:\n\n   Input for the first program: \n        n\n        a0 a1 ... a_{n-1}\n        s (string of n characters)\n\n   Output of the first program: an integer (say, X)\n\n   Then the second program is run with input: X (a single integer on one line)\n\n   The second program: \n        reads a line and splits into tokens -> one token: [str] where str is the string of X.\n        Then it iterates over the tokens:\n            token1: count=1 -> if token1 is \"0\", break and output 1; else next token? but there is none -> then output 1? \n\n   So the second program will always output 1? Because there is one token and it is not \"0\", so it breaks the loop only when it finds \"0\", which it doesn't, so it just outputs 1? \n\n But wait, the second program does:\n        result = 0\n        for each string in the array:\n            result += 1\n            if string equals \"0\", break.\n\n        Then output result.\n\n   So if the token is not \"0\", it will output the total number of tokens? Actually, no: because it breaks the loop only when it finds \"0\". Without break, it will go through all tokens and then output the count of tokens? \n\n   But note: the break is only when \"0\" is found. If not found, it will count the entire array. The array has one token -> output 1.\n\n   Therefore, regardless of the value of X, the second program outputs 1.\n\n This is clearly not the intended behavior of the second program in its original context, but in the chain that's what happens.\n\n However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So the entire chain should output 1? \n\n But that doesn't make sense because the first program does a computation that depends on the input and then the second program always outputs 1.\n\n Alternatively, we might have misunderstood the chain. The problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n There are two programs. The output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n Therefore, the entire system is:\n\n   Input: the input for the first program (n, array a, string s)\n   Output: the output of the second program (which, as argued, is 1)\n\n However, that would mean the entire computation of the first program is irrelevant? Because the second program always outputs 1.\n\n This seems odd. Let me check the second program again:\n\n   The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) is from AtCoder ABC170 A. The problem for that is:\n        \"You are given five integers x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. Find the index i such that xi=0.\"\n\n   So the input is five integers? But in the chain, the input to the second program is a single integer.\n\n   Therefore, the chain as described is broken.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I suspect that the problem intended the second program to be run with the same input that the first program had? But that is not what the problem says.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have provided two independent programs and we are to chain them? But the input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\n After re-examining the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So we must design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input that the first program reads (n, array a, string s)\n   Step 2: Compute the value `ans` as in the first program.\n   Step 3: Then use `ans` as the input to the second program.\n\n   The second program: \n        It expects a line of space-separated tokens. We have one token: the string representation of `ans`.\n        Then the second program counts the tokens until it finds a \"0\", and outputs the index (if found) or the total count if not? But note: the second program breaks when it finds a \"0\", so if it doesn't find a zero, it will output the total count of tokens? \n\n        However, the code in the second program:\n\n            String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n            int result = 0;\n            for (String str : input_array) {\n                result += 1;\n                if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n            }\n\n        So if the token is not \"0\", then after the first token, result becomes 1 and then the loop ends because there are no more tokens? Then it outputs 1.\n\n        Therefore, the entire program will output 1.\n\n   So the final output is always 1? \n\n This seems to be the case.\n\n However, let's test with an example for the first program:\n\n   Example: \n        n=3\n        a = [1, 2, 3]\n        s = \"BAB\"\n\n   Step in first program:\n        Initial sum: for indices with 'B': index0: 'B' -> 1, index1: 'A' -> skip, index2: 'B' -> 3 -> sum = 1+3 = 4.\n\n        Forward pass:\n            i0: 'B' -> becomes subtract: 4 - 1 = 3 -> ans = max(4,3)=4\n            i1: 'A' -> 3 + 2 = 5 -> ans = max(4,5)=5\n            i2: 'B' -> 5 - 3 = 2 -> ans = 5\n\n        Backward pass:\n            i2: 'B' -> 4 - 3 = 1 -> ans still 5\n            i1: 'A' -> 1 + 2 = 3 -> max(5,3)=5\n            i0: 'B' -> 3 - 1 = 2 -> ans=5\n\n        Output: 5.\n\n   Then the second program gets the string \"5\". It splits into [\"5\"]. Then:\n        result=0\n        first token: result=1, then check \"5\"==\"0\"? -> no -> loop ends (no more tokens) -> output 1.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n But note: the second program in the original (if run standalone) would have read 5 integers. But in the chain it reads one integer.\n\n So the Fortran program must:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, then the array a of n integers, then the string s of n characters.\n   Step 2: Compute the value `ans` as in the first program.\n   Step 3: Then, without any intermediate I/O, we simulate the second program: \n        We have one integer: `ans` (which we already computed). We convert it to a string? But note: the second program expects a line of tokens. We have one token: the string representation of `ans`.\n        Then we split that string? Actually, we don't need to split because we know there's only one token.\n\n        The second program's logic: \n            It counts the tokens until it finds a \"0\". Since we have one token and it is not \"0\", the count becomes 1 and then we break out of the loop? Actually, we don't break because the condition is not met, but the loop ends because there's only one token. Then we output 1.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program should output 1.\n\n However, wait: the second program breaks only when it finds a zero. In our case, we have one token and it is not zero, so we don't break, we just finish the loop. Then the result is 1.\n\n So the entire Fortran program should output 1.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n Therefore, we design:\n\n   Read the input for the first program: n, array a, string s.\n\n   Compute the value `ans` (as in the first Java program).\n\n   Then, for the second program: we are going to simulate the second program on the input that is the string representation of `ans`. But note: the second program expects a line of space-separated tokens. Since we are not actually reading from stdin at this point, we can represent the token as the string of `ans`.\n\n   Then we count: \n        token_count = 1\n        and we check if the token is \"0\" -> if yes, then we break and output token_count (which is 1) immediately. Otherwise, we finish the loop (which has only one token) and output token_count (which is 1).\n\n   So we don't need to do any splitting: we know we have one token.\n\n   Therefore, the final output is 1.\n\n However, note: the second program does not output the token count if it doesn't break? It outputs the current count at the moment it breaks, or if it doesn't break, it outputs the count of tokens processed? Actually, it outputs the count of tokens processed until the break, or the entire count if no break? But in the loop, we are counting every token. And we break only when we find a zero. In our case, we have one token and it is not zero -> we output 1.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program:\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read n.\n     2. Read an array a of n integers.\n     3. Read a string s of length n (without spaces? the Java program uses next(), which reads next token. So the string is one token).\n\n     4. Compute the initial sum: for each i, if s(i:i)=='B', then add a(i).\n     5. Then do two passes (forward and backward) to update the maximum value (ans).\n\n     6. Now, for the second program: we have the integer `ans`. We don't need to output it, but we need to simulate the second program with the input being the string representation of `ans`.\n\n        However, note: the second program splits the input line by spaces. We are going to have one token: the entire string of `ans`.\n\n        Then we set:\n            result = 0\n            For each token (we have only one) we do:\n                result = result + 1\n                if token == \"0\" then break\n\n            Then output result.\n\n        Since we have one token, we do:\n            result = 1\n            and if `ans` is 0, we break (but we still set result=1) and output 1? Actually, if `ans` is 0, then we break after the first token and output 1.\n\n        Therefore, regardless of `ans`, the output is 1.\n\n   So we can simply output 1?\n\n But wait: what if the second program had multiple tokens? But in our chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is one integer. So there is exactly one token.\n\n   Therefore, the entire Fortran program can be:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i\n        integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s   ! We'll read a string of length n\n        integer(kind=8) :: total, total1, ans  ! using kind=8 for long in Java\n        integer :: pos\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n, then array a of n integers, then string s\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(a(n))\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a(i)\n        end do\n        read(*,*) s   ! This reads the next token as a string\n\n        ! Check: the string s should be of length n? The Java program uses next() so it reads one token without spaces.\n        ! But note: the Java program then uses s.length() which is the length of the string. We assume the string has exactly n characters.\n\n        ! Step 2: Compute initial total for 'B'\n        total = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n                total = total + a(i)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ans = total\n\n        ! Forward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Backward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = n, 1, -1\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, we have the integer `ans` from the first program.\n\n        ! Step 3: Simulate the second program with input = the string representation of `ans`\n        ! But note: the second program expects a line of tokens. We have one token: the integer `ans` converted to string.\n        ! We don't actually need to convert to string because we know we have one token and we are going to output 1.\n\n        ! However, we must note: what if `ans` is 0? Then the second program would break at the first token and output 1? \n        ! But even if it is not zero, we output 1 because we have one token.\n\n        ! Therefore, the final output is 1.\n        write(*,*) 1\n\n        deallocate(a)\n        end program\n\n But wait: what if the second program had multiple tokens? In our chain, the input to the second program is a single integer, so one token. But what if the integer is negative? Then the string would have a minus sign? The second program would split and still get one token.\n\n        Example: ans = -5 -> token: \"-5\"\n\n        Then the second program: \n            token = \"-5\", which is not \"0\", so we set result=1 and then the loop ends -> output 1.\n\n        Therefore, always 1.\n\n So we can simply output 1.\n\n However, note: the second program in the original code (atcoder_ABC170_A) is designed for a fixed input of 5 integers. But in the chain, it is getting a single integer. So the behavior is fixed: one token -> output 1.\n\n Therefore, the entire Fortran program is as above, and we output 1.\n\n But is that what the chain does? Yes, as we tested.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we are reproducing the chain: the chain always outputs 1.\n\n But let me run the chain in Java:\n\n   First program: \n        Input: \n            3\n            1 2 3\n            BAB\n        Output: 5\n\n   Then run the second program with input \"5\":\n        It reads the string \"5\", splits -> [\"5\"]\n        Then: \n            result=0\n            first token: result=1, then check \"5\"==\"0\"? -> false -> no break -> loop ends (only one element) -> then prints 1.\n\n   So the chain outputs 1.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program must output 1.\n\n However, note: what if the first program outputs 0? Then the second program would break at the first token and output 1? Still 1.\n\n So the Fortran program:\n\n        ... (compute ans) ...\n        write(*,*) 1\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are writing 1 at the end.\n\n However, we must note: the second program does not output 1 in all contexts? It outputs the 1-indexed position of the first zero. But in our chain, the input is always one token and that token is the string of `ans`, which is non-empty and we are not breaking only if we find zero. But we break when we find zero? Actually, we break when we find a token that is exactly \"0\". So if `ans` is 0, then the token is \"0\", and we break at the first token and output 1. If `ans` is not zero, we don't break and the loop runs for one token and we output 1.\n\n So in all cases, the second program outputs 1.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program is:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i\n        integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s   ! We'll read a string of length n\n        integer(kind=8) :: total, total1, ans  ! using kind=8 for long in Java\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n, then array a of n integers, then string s\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(a(n))\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a(i)\n        end do\n        read(*,*) s   ! This reads the string token\n\n        ! We assume the string s has length n. But what if the string has spaces? The Java program uses next() which is space separated.\n        ! So the string s is without spaces and of length n.\n\n        ! Step 2: Compute initial total for 'B'\n        total = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n                total = total + a(i)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ans = total\n\n        ! Forward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Backward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = n, 1, -1\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, we have the integer `ans` from the first program.\n\n        ! Step 3: The second program: we are going to output 1.\n        write(*,*) 1\n\n        deallocate(a)\n        end program\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain is not using the value of `ans` at all? It only uses the fact that there is one token. So we don't need to use `ans` beyond the first part? \n\n But wait: the first program does a computation that might be necessary for the chain? But the second program ignores it? Then why do we compute `ans`? \n\n The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must compute `ans` because the first program does, even if the second program ignores it? \n\n But note: the chain is two programs. The first program does I/O and computation, then outputs `ans`. Then the second program uses that output as input. We are simulating the entire chain, so we must compute `ans` because it might affect the second program? But in this case, the second program only cares about the number of tokens? \n\n However, the second program does not get the value of `ans` as a number, it gets the string representation. But we are not using the value of `ans` to determine the output of the second program? Because regardless of the string (as long as it is one token) the output is 1.\n\n Therefore, we can skip the entire computation of `ans`? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The first program has side effects? Only computation and output. But we are not outputting `ans` in the Fortran program? We are only outputting 1 at the end.\n\n However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we cannot output `ans` and then read it again? We are not doing that. We are computing `ans` and then using it to determine the input for the second program? But in this case, the input for the second program is always one token? \n\n But note: the token is the string of `ans`. What if `ans` is a very large number that has spaces? Actually, no: the first program outputs a single integer without any spaces. So the token is one.\n\n Therefore, we can skip the computation of `ans`? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The first program might have different running time if n is large? But we are required to reproduce the same behavior, meaning same output and same side effects? \n\n Since the problem does not specify performance, and the output is always 1, we could in principle skip the entire first program? \n\n But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must include the computations of both programs? \n\n However, note: the first program might have side effects? It allocates memory and does loops. But the problem does not specify that we can skip. \n\n Therefore, to be safe, we do the entire computation of the first program and then output 1.\n\n But wait: what if the first program had an exception? For example, if n is negative? But the problem does not specify constraints. We assume the input is valid.\n\n So we write the Fortran program as above.\n\n One more note: the string `s` in Fortran: when we read with `read(*,*) s`, it reads a token. The token is stored without leading/trailing spaces. Then we use s(i:i) for i from 1 to n. But what if the string we read has length not equal to n? \n\n The Java program: \n        n = sc.nextInt();\n        a = new int[n];\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) a[i] = sc.nextInt();\n        s = sc.next();\n\n   Then s.length() is the length of the token. The problem says the string s has length n? \n\n   Example input: \n        3\n        1 2 3\n        BAB\n\n   Then s = \"BAB\", which has length 3 -> n.\n\n   But what if the input for the string is \"B A B\"? Then sc.next() would read \"B\", then we have two more tokens? That would break because the array a is of size 3 and we read three integers, then the string would be \"B\", and then the next tokens would be missing? \n\n   The problem does not specify. We assume the input is as expected: the string is a single token of n characters.\n\n   So in Fortran, we read the string as a token. Then we check the length of the token? \n\n   How to handle? We can read the string and then check that the length is n. If not, we cannot proceed? \n\n   But the problem says: behaves identically. The Java program would read the next token and use it as s. If the token has length != n, then the Java program would use it anyway? Then we do the same.\n\n   In Fortran, we can do:\n\n        character(len=100000) :: temp   ! assuming n <= 100000, or we can use allocatable\n\n   But the problem does not specify n. We can use:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n        read(*,*) temp   ! read into a long enough character variable, then set s?\n        ! But we don't know the length in advance.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the token and then get its length.\n\n   How about:\n\n        character(len=1000000) :: line   ! large enough\n        read(*,'(A)') line   ! This reads the entire line? But the string is the next token.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        read(*,*) s   ! This will read the next token and store it in s, but we need to declare s as variable length.\n\n   In Fortran 2003, we can do:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n        read(*,*) s\n\n   Then s will be allocated to the length of the token.\n\n   But then we have to make sure that the token has at least n characters? Actually, the Java program uses the token and then uses indices from 0 to n-1. If the token has length L < n, then we will access beyond the string? \n\n   Similarly, if L > n, then we only use the first n characters? \n\n   The Java program: \n        for (int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) ... \n        but note: the array a has length n, and the string s has length n? The problem says: the string s is the next token and then the program uses s.length() which is n? \n\n   Actually, the input specification for the first program: \n        The first line contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u226410^5)\n        The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n        The third line contains a string s of length n\n\n   So we can assume the string has exactly n characters.\n\n   Therefore, we can read the string and then check its length? But the problem says: the string is of length n.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        read(*,*) s\n        if (len(s) /= n) then\n            ! But the problem says it is of length n, so we assume it is.\n            ! Otherwise, we might need to adjust? We'll assume n is the length.\n\n   Actually, the Java program does:\n\n        s = sc.next();   // reads next token\n        // then uses s.length() which is the actual length of the token.\n\n        But note: the problem says the string s of length n. So we can assume the token has length n.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: s)   ! This is fixed length n? But we don't know the token might be longer? \n\n   Alternatively, we read the token and then we take the first n characters? \n\n   But the Java program uses the entire token. And the token is supposed to be of length n.\n\n   So we read the token and then we check that it has exactly n characters? \n\n   How to read a token of exactly n characters? \n\n        read(*,*) s   ! reads a token, but the token might be shorter? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        character(len=100000) :: s_temp\n        read(*,*) s_temp\n        s = s_temp(1:n)   ! but if the token is shorter than n, then we pad with spaces? \n\n   But the Java program would use the entire token. And if the token has length L, then the loop runs for L, but the array a has n elements. So if L != n, we have an index out of bounds? \n\n   Therefore, we must assume the token has exactly n non-space characters.\n\n   The problem states: the third line contains a string s of length n.\n\n   So we can read the entire line? But the string s might be the only token on the line? \n\n        read(*,'(A)') line   ! read the entire line\n        s = trim(adjustl(line))   ? but that trims and adjusts, and then we take the first n characters? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the string s of length n. So we can read exactly n characters? \n\n        character(len=n) :: s\n        read(*,*) s   ! This might read only the first token, which might be less than n? \n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then take the first n non-space characters? But the problem says the string is of length n and consists of characters 'A' and 'B'. And the input specification says: the third line contains a string s of length n.\n\n   So we can read the next n characters? \n\n        read(*,'(A)') s   ! if we declared s as character(len=n)\n\n   But what if the line has more than n characters? Then we take the first n.\n\n   However, the problem says: the string s of length n. So we can do:\n\n        character(len=n) :: s\n        read(*,*) s   ! This reads the next token, which might be less than n? \n\n   We want to read exactly n characters? The problem says the entire third line is the string of n characters? \n\n   Then we can do:\n\n        read(*,'(A)') s   ! read the entire line, but if the line has more than n characters, we take the first n? \n\n   But the specification says: the third line contains the string s. So we can read the entire line and then take the first n characters? \n\n   However, the Java program uses `sc.next()`, which reads tokens. So if the string has spaces, then it would only read the first token? \n\n   But the problem says: the string s of length n and consists only of 'A' and 'B'. So no spaces? \n\n   Therefore, we can read the next token and assign it to s, and then we know it has no spaces and is of length n.\n\n   So in Fortran, we can do:\n\n        character(len=100000) :: temp\n        read(*,*) temp\n        ! Then we set s = temp(1:n) ? But what if the token is longer than n? \n        ! The problem says the string is of length n, so we take the first n characters? \n\n   But the Java program uses the entire token. If the token is longer than n, then the Java program would use more than n characters? And then the array a has only n elements -> index out of bounds.\n\n   Therefore, we assume the token has exactly n characters.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        character(len=n) :: s\n        read(*,*) s   ! This will read a token and then if the token is longer than n, it will store the first n characters? and the rest remains? But then the next read would be messed up? \n\n   Actually, using list-directed input (read(*,*) for a string) reads the next token and stores it in the variable. If the variable is of length n, then:\n        - If the token has m characters and m<=n, then the variable is padded with spaces on the right.\n        - If m>n, then the token is truncated to n.\n\n   But the problem says the token has length n. So we can do:\n\n        character(len=n) :: s\n        read(*,*) s\n\n   Then we have the first n characters of the token? But if the token is exactly n, then we get the whole token.\n\n   So we'll do that.\n\n   Revised code:\n\n        program main\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i\n        integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: s   ! But we want fixed length n? \n        ! Alternatively, we can do:\n        character(len=100000) :: s_temp   ! maximum n up to 100000? \n        integer(kind=8) :: total, total1, ans\n\n        ! Read n\n        read(*,*) n\n\n        ! Allocate a\n        allocate(a(n))\n\n        ! Read array a\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a(i)\n        end do\n\n        ! Read string s: we know it should be of length n. We'll read into a buffer and then take the first n characters?\n        ! But we can declare s as a variable of length n.\n        ! Since n can be up to 10^5, we can do:\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n        read(*,*) s   ! This will read the next token and put the first n characters into s.\n\n        ! Step 2: Compute initial total for 'B'\n        total = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n                total = total + a(i)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ans = total\n\n        ! Forward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Backward pass\n        total1 = total\n        do i = n, 1, -1\n            if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n                total1 = total1 + a(i)\n            else\n                total1 = total1 - a(i)\n            end if\n            if (total1 > ans) ans = total1\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 3: Output 1 for the second program.\n        write(*,*) 1\n\n        deallocate(a)\n        deallocate(s)\n        end program\n\n But note: what if the token for s is shorter than n? Then the rest of s is filled with spaces. Then in the loop, we check for 'B' or 'A', but space is neither. So we skip. That matches the Java program? \n\n   In Java, if the token is shorter than n, then for indices beyond the token length, s.charAt(i) would be ... but the token has length n? So we assume it is n.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n Let me test with n=3, a = [1,2,3], s = \"BAB\"\n\n   We read s as \"BAB\" (stored in a string of length 3) -> s(1:1)='B', s(2:2)='A', s(3:3)='B'\n\n   Then the computation is as expected.\n\n   Output: 1.\n\n Therefore, the program is complete.\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain always outputs 1. But what if the chain had more programs? But there are only two.\n\n So we output 1.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". There are two programs. We have done.\n\n We write the Fortran program accordingly."
