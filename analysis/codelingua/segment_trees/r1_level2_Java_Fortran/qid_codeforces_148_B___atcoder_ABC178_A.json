    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (codeforces_148_B) reads 5 doubles and computes an integer answer. The second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) reads an integer and outputs 1 if the input is 0, and 0 if the input is 1? Actually, let me clarify:\n\nSecond program:\n  It reads an integer `x`.\n  Then sets `bool = (x == 1)`\n  Then sets `result = (!bool) ? 1 : 0` which is equivalent to:\n      if x != 1 then result = 1, else result = 0.\n\nBut note: the second program is designed to take one integer as input and output either 0 or 1.\n\nHowever, the entire sequence means:\n  - The input to the first program is the original input (five integers: VP, VD, T, F, C).\n  - The output of the first program is an integer (the number of times the princess is caught? or the number of additional bijous?).\n  - Then the second program takes that integer as its input and outputs either 0 or 1.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects an integer. The first program outputs either 0, 1, 2, ... etc.\n\nHowever, note that the second program's behavior:\n  Input x:\n    if x is 1 -> output 0\n    otherwise -> output 1\n\nBut note: the second program also outputs 1 for x=0? Indeed.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. So we have:\n\nOriginal input: five numbers (VP, VD, T, F, C) for the first program.\n\nThen the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input to the second program.\n\nThen the second program outputs either 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence output is the output of the second program.\n\nHowever, note that the first program outputs an integer (using System.out.println) and the second program reads that integer.\n\nBut in Fortran, we are to write a single program that does:\n\n1. Read the five numbers (VP, VD, T, F, C) from input (only once at the beginning).\n2. Process the first program's logic to compute an integer (let's call it `ans1`).\n3. Then process the second program's logic: \n      if `ans1` is 1 then output 0, else output 1.\n\nBut wait: the second program actually does:\n      bool = (x == 1)   -> if x is 1 then bool is true, else false.\n      result = (bool is false) then 1, else 0.\n\nSo: \n      if `ans1` is 1 -> output 0\n      else (any other value, including 0, 2, 3, ...) -> output 1.\n\nHowever, note the first program only outputs nonnegative integers. And the first program outputs 0 when VD<=VP, or when the princess doesn't get caught enough times to drop bijous beyond C.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence output is 0 only when the first program outputs 1, and 1 otherwise.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs 0, 1, 2, ... So:\n\n  If the first program outputs 1 -> then the second program outputs 0.\n  If the first program outputs 0 -> then the second program outputs 1.\n  If the first program outputs 2 -> then the second program outputs 1.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Read the five numbers: VP, VD, T, F, C (as integers? the Java code uses nextInt, so integers, but then stored in doubles. In Fortran, we can read as integers and convert to real? Or read as real? The problem says same behavior. The Java program reads integers but stores in doubles. So we can read as integers and convert to real? Or just read as real? Since they are integers, it doesn't matter.\n\n  Step 2: Compute the first program's answer (ans1) as an integer.\n\n  Step 3: Then, if ans1 == 1, then output 0; else output 1.\n\nBut note: the second program only reads one integer. So we don't output the intermediate ans1, we just use it to compute the final output.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n  - Read five integers (or real numbers? but the input is integers) as real variables? Because the first Java program uses doubles for computation. So we can use real variables in Fortran.\n\n  - Then, if VD <= VP, set ans1 = 0 (and then the second program will output 1).\n\n  - Otherwise, simulate the loop.\n\n  - Then, after having ans1 (the integer from the first program), set:\n          if (ans1 == 1) then\n              result = 0\n          else\n              result = 1\n          endif\n\n  - Then output result.\n\nBut note: the first program uses integer arithmetic? Actually, it uses doubles but the answer is an integer. The variable `answer` is an integer, and we increment by one each time. So we can store ans1 as integer.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Variables for first program: VP, VD, T, F, C: real (or double precision)\n  ans1: integer\n\n  Then we do:\n\n      if (VD <= VP) then\n          ans1 = 0\n      else\n          ... while loop as in the first program ...\n\n  Then:\n\n      if (ans1 == 1) then\n          write(*,*) 0\n      else\n          write(*,*) 1\n      endif\n\nBut wait: the second program outputs 1 for any value of ans1 that is not 1? Including 0? So:\n\n      if (ans1 == 1) then\n          final = 0\n      else\n          final = 1\n      endif\n\n  Then output final.\n\nHowever, note: the second program outputs a single integer.\n\nBut the problem says: only the last block produces output.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Read the five numbers (as real? because they are integers but stored in doubles, so we can read as real or double precision. Let's use double precision for accuracy).\n\n  Then compute ans1 as integer.\n\n  Then compute the final result (an integer: either 0 or 1).\n\n  Then output that final result.\n\nLet's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nImportant: In the first program, the condition in the loop is:\n\n      double x = start * VP / (VD - VP);\n      if ((start + x) * VP >= C) {\n          break;\n      }\n\nBut note: start is initially T (the time the dragon starts after the princess). Then in the loop, we do:\n\n      start += 2 * x + F;\n\nAnd we increment answer by one each time.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n      start = T\n      ans1 = 0\n      do while (.true.)\n          x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n          ! The princess has been traveling for (start + x) time -> distance = (start+x)*VP\n          if ((start + x) * VP >= C) then\n              exit\n          end if\n          ans1 = ans1 + 1\n          start = start + 2*x + F\n      end do\n\nBut note: the condition for breaking is when the princess reaches or exceeds the cave (C) during the time the dragon catches her? Actually, the condition is: if after the time x (which is the time the dragon takes to catch the princess) the princess's total travel time is start+x and then the distance is (start+x)*VP, and if that distance is >= C, then we break (meaning she reached the cave without needing to drop another bijou?).\n\nAlso note: we have the initial condition: if VD<=VP, then we break immediately and set ans1=0.\n\nBut in the else branch, we set ans1=0 initially and then increment in the loop.\n\nBut note: the first program sets answer=0 and then increments in the loop. And the loop condition is checked at the beginning of the loop.\n\nSo we can code accordingly.\n\nLet me use:\n\n  double precision :: VP, VD, T, F, C, start, x\n  integer :: ans1\n\nBut note: we are reading integers? The input is integers. But we are storing in double precision. So we can read as integers and convert? Or read as double precision? Since the input is integers, we can read as integers and assign to double precision? Or we can read as double precision.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read integers and assign to real variables? The compiler will convert. But let's read as real (double precision) to match the Java.\n\nAlternatively, we can read as integers and then convert to double precision? But the problem says the same behavior. Since the input is integers, we can read as integers and then assign to double precision variables? Or read as double precision? Either way.\n\nI'll read as double precision.\n\nCode structure:\n\n  program combined\n      implicit none\n      double precision :: VP, VD, T, F, C\n      double precision :: start, x\n      integer :: ans1, final_result\n\n      ! Read the five numbers\n      read(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\n      ! First program logic\n      if (VD <= VP) then\n          ans1 = 0\n      else\n          ans1 = 0\n          start = T\n          do\n              x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n              ! Condition: (start + x) * VP >= C -> break\n              if ((start + x) * VP >= C) then\n                  exit\n              end if\n              ans1 = ans1 + 1\n              start = start + 2*x + F\n          end do\n      end if\n\n      ! Now, the second program logic: \n      if (ans1 == 1) then\n          final_result = 0\n      else\n          final_result = 1\n      end if\n\n      ! Output the final result (only one integer)\n      write(*,*) final_result\n\n  end program combined\n\nBut note: the Java first program uses doubles for the computation. We are using double precision in Fortran, which should be similar.\n\nHowever, let me check the loop condition: in the first program, the condition is:\n\n      if ((start + x) * VP >= C) break;\n\nWe do the same.\n\nAlso, the initial condition: if VD<=VP, we set ans1=0.\n\nBut note: the first program returns 0 immediately. So we skip the loop.\n\nIn the else branch, we set ans1=0 and then enter the loop. The loop may break immediately? Let's see: if (start+x)*VP >= C at the first iteration, then we break without incrementing ans1. So ans1 remains 0.\n\nThat matches the first program.\n\nNow, the second program: we have ans1 (an integer) and then set final_result = 0 if ans1==1, else 1.\n\nThen output.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs without any extra spaces? The Java program uses println, which prints the integer and then a newline.\n\nIn Fortran, we use `write(*,*)` which by default adds a space and a newline? But the problem does not specify the formatting. Since the original output is just the integer and then a newline, and Fortran's `write(*,*)` does that (with a space at the beginning?).\n\nWe can use `write(*,'(I0)') final_result` to avoid the space? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The output should be the same integer value. The space is acceptable? Or we can use formatted output to avoid the space.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      print *, final_result\n\nBut that also adds a space.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the integer without any formatting (e.g., just the digits). The second program outputs the same.\n\nIn the combined output, we are outputting either 0 or 1. So we can do:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result\n\nThis writes the integer without any leading or trailing spaces, and then a newline? Actually, I0 is the minimum width. And by default, it will output without extra spaces and then a newline? Actually, when using `write(*, '(I0)')` it writes the integer and then the next output would be on a new line? But we are only writing one value.\n\nSo:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result\n\nThis will output the integer in the minimal representation and then a newline? Actually, no: the format I0 writes the integer without leading spaces, and then the record ends? But when we do a write, it by default ends with a newline? Actually, the format doesn't include the newline? We have to add it? Or use:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result   ! This writes without extra spaces and without a newline?\n\nActually, we should include a newline. In Fortran, if we do:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result\n\nit will write the integer and then stop, but the next write would be on the same line? We need to output a newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n      write(*, *) final_result   ! which writes with a space and a newline.\n\nBut the original output is just the integer and then a newline. The space is acceptable? The problem says \"behaves identically\" meaning same value? The value is the same. But if the problem expects no space, then we should avoid it.\n\nSince the second program in Java uses `out.println(result);`, which outputs the integer and then a newline. The integer is output as a string of digits without any space.\n\nTo be safe, we can output without any extra spaces:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result\n\nBut note: the Fortran standard says that the format I0 will output the integer without leading spaces and without trailing spaces, and then the record is advanced? Actually, the record (line) is advanced only if we don't use the non-advancing I/O. The default is to advance the record. So:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result   ! This will output the integer and then a newline.\n\nBut let me test: in Fortran, if I write:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') 1\n\nit outputs \"1\" and then a newline? Actually, no. The format I0 writes the integer in the minimal width. Then the write statement by default writes a newline after the entire record? Actually, the entire record is the format string. The format string is processed and then the record is finished and a newline is written? \n\nActually, the format specification in Fortran does not include the newline. We have to explicitly add it? Or the default is to write a newline at the end? \n\nWe can do:\n\n      write(*, '(I0, /)') final_result   ! This would output the integer and then a newline? Actually, the / is a newline.\n\nBut that would output two newlines? Because the write statement by default ends with a newline? Actually, the default record ends with a newline. So without any control, the entire record is written and then a newline is added? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\nThis will output the integer and then a newline? Yes, because the print statement automatically appends a newline.\n\nSo:\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\nThis will output the integer without any spaces and then a newline.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"only the last block should handle producing output\". And we are outputting one integer.\n\nSo let's use:\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result   ! and this also by default adds a newline? \n\nActually, in Fortran, when you use a formatted write with a format string, the write does not automatically add a newline. It writes exactly as specified. So:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result   -> writes the integer without any spaces, and then the record is ended? and then the next write would start on a new line? But the record is the entire line? Actually, the system may not output a newline until the next write? Or at the end of the program? \n\nTo be safe, we can explicitly add a newline:\n\n      write(*, '(I0)') final_result\n      ! Then we need to flush? But the program ends.\n\nBut the problem: we output one integer and then the program ends. The operating system will flush the output. But to be safe, we can use:\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\nwhich is simpler and will output the integer and then a newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      write(*, '(I0, /)') final_result   -> this writes the integer and then a newline? Actually, the / is a newline, so it writes two newlines? \n\nNo: the format string '(I0, /)' means: write the integer with no leading spaces, then write a newline (which ends the current record and starts a new one). Then the write statement completes? And then the program ends. So we have:\n\n      [integer]\\n\n\nBut that is one newline? Actually, the / in the format writes a newline. Then the write statement also by default ends the record? So we get two newlines? Actually, the / writes a newline and then the write statement does not add an extra one? I think we only get one.\n\nBut let me avoid confusion: use:\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\nThis is simple and outputs the integer and one newline.\n\nSo the complete code:\n\n  program combined\n      implicit none\n      double precision :: VP, VD, T, F, C\n      double precision :: start, x\n      integer :: ans1, final_result\n\n      read(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\n      if (VD <= VP) then\n          ans1 = 0\n      else\n          ans1 = 0\n          start = T\n          do\n              x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n              if ((start + x) * VP >= C) exit\n              ans1 = ans1 + 1\n              start = start + 2*x + F\n          end do\n      end if\n\n      if (ans1 == 1) then\n          final_result = 0\n      else\n          final_result = 1\n      end if\n\n      print '(I0)', final_result\n\n  end program combined\n\nBut note: the first program uses doubles. We are using double precision, which is usually 64-bit, same as Java double.\n\nAlso, the condition (VD<=VP) might be subject to floating point issues? But the input are integers. So we can compare without tolerance? Because integers are represented exactly.\n\nSimilarly, the computations: the input are integers, but the operations (like division) might introduce rounding? We are using the same algorithm as the Java program, so it should be the same.\n\nHowever, note: the condition in the loop: (start+x)*VP >= C. This might be subject to floating point inaccuracies. But the Java program does the same.\n\nSo we are matching the behavior.\n\nLet me test with the example from the problem? But the problem does not give examples. But we are following the same steps.\n\nOne more thing: the variables are declared as double precision. We read five double precision numbers? But the input is integers. So we can read as integers and assign to double precision? Or read as double precision? The read(*,*) will work for integers and assign to double precision? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can read as integers and then convert? But we don't need to. The read will convert the tokens to the type of the variables.\n\nSo the above code should work.\n\nBut note: the first program reads integers (using nextInt) and then stores as doubles. So the read in Fortran will work similarly.\n\nTherefore, we output the Fortran code as below."
