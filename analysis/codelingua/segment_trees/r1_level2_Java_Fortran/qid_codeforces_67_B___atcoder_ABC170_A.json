Then we can be sure that if the first program would have crashed (like an array index out of bounds) we crash too? But in Fortran we can check bounds? How does the first program work? We have an array aa of size n, initially zeros? (but in Java, integers are initialized to 0). Then:\n\n        m = 0\n        for a from n-1 down to 0:\n            j = 0\n            while (bb[a] > 0) {\n                if (aa[j] >= a + k) then bb[a]--\n                j++\n            }\n            then we shift the elements in aa from j to m-1 to the right by one, and set aa[j] = a, and then m++. This algorithm is known as \"reconstruction\" of a permutation from an inversion-like array? We must simulate this to be safe? Because if the input bb is invalid, the while loop might run forever? For example, if bb[a] is too large? But the constraints say bb[i] is between 0 and n-1. And the algorithm is designed for that. Therefore, we do:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, k, and bb(1..n)",

But note: the read statement: we read the integers for bb. We can read them in a loop for i=0 to n-1. Example input:\n\n        n=3, k=0, bb = [0,0,0]\n\n   Then the algorithm:\n\n        a = 2 (n-1=2): \n            j=0\n            while (bb(2)>0) -> false, so skip. then shift: m=0 -> j=0: we don't shift? Then set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1:\n            j=0\n            while (bb(1)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: now m=1, j=0: we shift from m=1 down to j+1=1: so j_=1: then aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=2, then set aa(0)=1. m=2.\n\n        a=0:\n            j=0\n            while (bb(0)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: m=2, j=0: shift from m=2 down to 1: \n                aa(2)=aa(1) -> aa(2)=2\n                aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=1\n            then set aa(0)=0, m=3. Then the first program would output: \n            aa[0]+1 = 1, aa[1]+1=2, aa[2]+1=3 -> \"1 2 3 \"\n\n        The second program: tokens = [1,2,3] -> count until zero: not found, so count=3 -> output 3. Our program outputs 3. Another example: n=3, k=1, bb = [0,0,0]\n\n        a=2: \n            j=0 -> skip while. set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1:\n            j=0: while (bb(1)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: aa(1)=aa(0)=2, then set aa(0)=1 -> aa(0)=1, aa(1)=2, m=2. a=0:\n            j=0: while (bb(0)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: aa(2)=aa(1)=2, aa(1)=aa(0)=1, set aa(0)=0 -> aa=[0,1,2]\n            output: 1,2,3 -> same as above. Then output 3. But what if bb is not zero? Example: n=3, k=1, bb=[0,1,0]\n\n        a=2 (which is the last element, index2): \n            bb(2)=0 -> skip while. Then set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1 (index1): \n            bb(1)=1>0 -> enter while.\n                j=0: aa(0)=2. Check: 2>=1+1 -> 2>=2 -> true -> so bb(1) becomes 0, then j becomes 1 -> break while. Then we shift: from m=1 (current elements at index0) to j+1=2? Actually, we are going to shift from m=1 down to j+1? j=1: j+1=2 -> but m=1, so the loop: j_ from 1 down to 2? step is -1: so if 1>=2? no -> skip. Then set aa(j)=aa(1)=? -> we set aa(1)=1. Then m=2. Now aa(0)=2, aa(1)=1.\n\n        a=0 (index0): \n            bb(0)=0 -> skip.\n            shift: j=0 -> shift from m=2 down to j+1=1: \n                j_=2: aa(2)=aa(1)=1\n                j_=1: then we would do? but we stop at j+1=1? so we do j_=2 and then j_=1? condition: j_ from 2 to 1 step -1: so we do j_=2 and then j_=1? But note: the loop: \n                    do j_ = m, j+1, -1   -> m=2, j+1=1 -> so j_=2, then 1? So: \n                    aa(2)=aa(1) -> aa(2)=1\n                    aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=2\n                Then set aa(0)=0 -> aa(0)=0, aa(1)=2, aa(2)=1. Then output: 1, 3, 2. The second program: tokens = [1,3,2] -> no zero, so output 3. Our program outputs 3. Therefore, we write the Fortran program as described. However, note: the shifting loop: \n\n        do j_ = m, j+1, -1 But m is the current size (the next free index is at m). We are shifting from m down to j+1? Example: if j=0 and m=1: then we do j_ from 1 down to 1? so we do j_=1: then aa(1)=aa(0). Then set aa(0)=a.\n\n        That matches. Code: We use free form Fortran. Note: The array indices: we use 0-indexed. We assume n<=1000? But we allocate dynamically. We read from standard input. We output n at the end. Let's write the code accordingly.",

But the while loop uses the current values of aa(j) for j from 0 to m-1? And initially m=0, so the while loop for the first a (a=n-1) will not enter the while loop (because initially m=0, so j=0 and then we break the while loop without any iteration? because j is 0 and then we do the shift for j=0: then set aa(0)=a. Then m becomes 1. Then next a = n-2: then we start with j=0, and then we check bb(a) (which is the original bb(n-2) modified? Actually, in the while loop we decrement bb(a) only when we see an element in aa that is >= a+k. But note: we are modifying bb(a) during the while loop.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n The first Java program (codeforces_67_B) does:\n   Reads n, k, and an array bb of n integers.\n   Then it constructs an array aa of n integers by processing from the end of bb.\n   Finally, it prints the array aa (each element incremented by 1) as space separated.\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_ABC170_A) does:\n   Reads a line of space separated strings and finds the first occurrence of \"0\" and returns the 1-indexed position.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program is used as input to the second.\n\n But note: the first program outputs a string of space separated integers (each is aa[i]+1) and then a newline.\n\n The second program expects a line of space separated strings and then it breaks at the first \"0\".\n\n So the chain is:\n   Input to the entire sequence: the input of the first program (n, k, and the array bb).\n   Then the first program produces a string of numbers (each aa[i]+1) separated by spaces and a newline.\n   This string is the input to the second program.\n\n The second program then reads that string and splits by space. Then it counts the position (starting at 1) until it finds the string \"0\", and outputs that position.\n\n However, note: the first program does not output the number 0 necessarily. It outputs the array aa where each element is an index (0-indexed) in the original array? Then it adds 1. So the numbers are at least 1.\n\n But the second program breaks when it finds the string \"0\". So if the first program's output does not contain \"0\", then the second program would output the total count of numbers? Actually, the second program breaks the loop when it finds \"0\", so if there is no \"0\", then it will output the total number of tokens? Let's see:\n\n   Example: input to second program: \"1 2 3 4\"\n        result = 0\n        token1: \"1\" -> result becomes 1, then check if \"1\" equals \"0\" -> no.\n        token2: \"2\" -> result becomes 2, then check -> no.\n        token3: \"3\" -> result becomes 3 -> no.\n        token4: \"4\" -> result becomes 4 -> no.\n        Then it breaks out of the loop? Actually, no: the loop iterates over all tokens. It breaks only when it finds \"0\". So it will set result to 4 and then break? No, the break is inside the condition of finding \"0\". So without \"0\", it will set result to the number of tokens (because it counts each token by incrementing by one for each token). So the output is the total number of tokens.\n\n But note: the first program outputs n numbers (each at least 1) and then a newline. There is no zero. So the second program will output n.\n\n However, that does not match the intended behavior of the second program? The second program is from ABC170_A which is \"Five Variables\", which has five integers and one of them is zero. But here the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a permutation of [1, n] (each element is aa[i]+1, and aa is a permutation of [0, n-1] so the numbers are 1..n). There is no zero. So the second program would output n.\n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs a zero? The first program: aa[j] = a (which is from 0 to n-1), then when we print aa[i]+1, we get numbers from 1 to n. So no zero.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain: \n   Input: n, k, and an array bb of n integers (each nonnegative? and satisfying constraints of the problem).\n   First program: computes a permutation aa of [0, n-1] and then outputs the array of aa[i]+1 (so 1-indexed permutation of 1..n).\n   Second program: reads the tokens and counts until it finds a \"0\", which it never does, so it counts all tokens (which is n) and outputs n.\n\n However, that seems trivial. But note the problem says: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\n But the first program outputs a string of n numbers (each between 1 and n) and a newline. The second program then splits that string and gets n tokens. Then it counts each token until it finds a \"0\". Since there is none, it counts all tokens and outputs n.\n\n So the entire chain: \n   Input: n, k, and an array bb of n integers.\n   Output: n.\n\n However, that seems too simple. But that is what the chain does.\n\n But wait: the second program does:\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n\n So it breaks only when it finds the string \"0\". Since the first program outputs numbers from 1 to n, there is no \"0\". Therefore, the second program will count the number of tokens and output that number.\n\n How many tokens? The first program outputs n tokens. So the output is n.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain is equivalent to: read n, k, and an array of n integers, then output n.\n\n However, that would be the case if the first program always outputs n tokens without a zero. But note: the first program's output is a permutation of 1..n, so no zero. And the number of tokens is n.\n\n So we can just do:\n   read n, k, and the array bb (of n integers)\n   then write n\n\n But wait: what if the first program fails? We have to simulate the first program because the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n But note: the first program does some computation and produces a string. Then the second program reads that string and outputs the count until it finds a zero (which it doesn't) so the output is the total count.\n\n Therefore, the output is always n.\n\n However, let's check the first program:\n\n   It reads n, k, and an array bb of n integers.\n\n   Then it constructs an array aa of n integers by:\n\n        for (int a = n - 1; a >= 0; a--) {\n            int j = 0;\n            while (bb[a] > 0) {\n                if (aa[j] >= a + k) bb[a]--;\n                j++;\n            }\n            for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n            aa[j] = a;\n        }\n\n   Then it prints aa[i] + 1 for each i.\n\n   The array aa is a permutation of [0, n-1]. So the output is n numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the second program will output n.\n\n So we can write a Fortran program that:\n\n   - Reads n, k, and an array bb of n integers.\n   - Then outputs n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". We are not allowed to skip the computation of the first program if it doesn't affect the output? Actually, it does affect: the first program does a complex permutation, but the second program only counts the tokens and ignores the values. So we can skip the permutation?\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program might have side effects? But in Fortran, we are to write a program that does the same. Since the second program only counts the tokens, and the first program always outputs n tokens (without zero), the output is n.\n\n But what if the first program crashes for some input? We are not told that the input is valid. But the original chain runs the first program and then the second. So we must run the first program? Actually, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the first program fails (like an exception) then we should fail too. But the problem doesn't specify that. We assume valid input.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". Therefore, we must simulate the entire computation? But note: the second program only depends on the number of tokens and the presence of \"0\". Since we know the first program outputs n tokens without zero, we can avoid the heavy computation? But the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\", meaning we are not to write the intermediate string. But we are allowed to compute the intermediate result and then use it? Actually, we can avoid building the string because we know the second program only counts tokens? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" meaning we are not to write and then read the string. But we can simulate the entire process without building the string.\n\n But note: the second program does not require the actual tokens, only the count and the fact that there is no zero. Since we know the first program outputs n tokens and no zero, we can just output n.\n\n However, the problem does not say we can optimize. It says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program might be important for the correctness? For example, if the first program had an infinite loop, we must have an infinite loop? But we are not told that the input is always valid. But the problem says \"on the same input\".\n\n Therefore, to be safe, we must run the algorithm of the first program? Because if the input causes the first program to crash, we must crash too? But Fortran doesn't have exceptions. We can use error stops? But the original Java program uses Scanner which might throw on invalid input? We are to assume the input is valid? The problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem says \"on the same input\", we assume the input is valid and the first program runs to completion.\n\n But note: the first program might have logic that depends on the input. For example, what if k is negative? Then the condition `aa[j] >= a + k` might be always true? But we are not told the constraints. The original problem for which the first program was written (codeforces 67_B) has constraints: 1<=n<=1000, 0<=k<=n, and bb[i] is between 0 and n-1. So we assume valid input.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k, and the array bb of n integers.\n\n   Step 2: Simulate the algorithm of the first program to compute the array aa. But note: we don't need to build the string? The second program only uses the output string to count tokens and check for \"0\". Since we know the output string has n tokens and no token is \"0\", we can skip building the string? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must compute the intermediate result (the array aa) because the problem does not allow us to skip the computation? Even though the second program doesn't use the values? \n\n   But note: the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior includes the time and memory? We are not required to match performance? But we must compute the same intermediate state? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not require to output the intermediate string. The final output is the output of the second program, which is n. So we can avoid building the string and just output n.\n\n   However, what if the first program has side effects that we are not aware of? For example, if the first program modifies bb? Then we must do that? But the second program doesn't use bb. But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must run the first program exactly as it is? \n\n   Therefore, to be safe, we must:\n\n        - Read n, k, and the array bb.\n        - Run the algorithm of the first program to compute the array aa (so we must do the same loops and array manipulations).\n        - Then, without printing, we know that the second program would see n tokens and no zero, so we output n.\n\n   But note: the first program might not complete for some inputs? But we assume valid inputs.\n\n   Alternatively, we note that the first program does not have any side effects that affect the output of the second program (other than the string it outputs). Since we are not going to output the string, but we know the string has n tokens and no zero, we can just output n.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must compute the intermediate steps without I/O. That means we must compute the array aa as in the first program? But we don't use it for anything else? \n\n   But what if the first program has a bug that causes it to output a different number of tokens? For example, if the first program outputs n-1 tokens? Then the second program would output n-1. But the first program always outputs n tokens? \n\n   How is the output of the first program built?\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) print(aa[i] + 1 + \" \");\n\n        This prints n tokens: each aa[i]+1 as a string, and then a space. Then a newline.\n\n        The second program reads a line and splits by space. The split will produce an array of tokens. The last token might have a trailing space? Actually, the print prints: \"aa[0]+1 aa[1]+1 ... aa[n-1]+1 \" (with a trailing space). Then the split will produce an array of n+1 tokens? Because the trailing space? Let me check in Java:\n\n          String s = \"1 2 3 \";\n          String[] tokens = s.split(\" \"); \n          tokens: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"] -> note: trailing spaces are ignored? Actually, split with one space as delimiter in Java: the trailing empty strings are discarded? \n\n        From the documentation: split(\" \") will remove trailing empty strings.\n\n        So the tokens are exactly n.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will output n.\n\n   So regardless of the first program's computation, the number of tokens is n.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain outputs n.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, k, i\n          integer, allocatable :: bb(:)\n          read *, n, k\n          allocate(bb(n))\n          do i = 1, n\n            read *, bb(i)\n          end do\n          ! We don't need to compute the permutation because the output of the chain is always n.\n          print *, n\n        end program\n\n   But is that acceptable? The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are skipping the computation of the first program. What if the first program has an infinite loop? Then we must have an infinite loop? But the problem says \"on the same input\", and we assume the input is valid. The constraints of the first program are known? And the algorithm is known to terminate? \n\n   However, the problem requires to translate the entire sequence. So we must include the computation of the first program? Even if it is not used? Because the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\", meaning we are not to output and then input the intermediate string. But we are allowed to compute the intermediate state (the array aa) without printing it? Then we can use the fact that the second program's output is n? \n\n   But note: what if the first program outputs a zero? We said it doesn't. But what if due to a bug it does? Then the second program would break early. But the first program is known to output numbers from 1 to n. So no zero.\n\n   Therefore, we can avoid the computation.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program might be to crash for some inputs? But we assume valid inputs? The problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem says \"on the same input\", and the input is the same, we must do the same steps? \n\n   Considering the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\", it is safer to compute the first program's aa array. Then we can be sure that if the first program would have crashed (like an array index out of bounds) we crash too? But in Fortran we can check bounds? \n\n   How does the first program work?\n\n        We have an array aa of size n, initially zeros? (but in Java, integers are initialized to 0). Then:\n\n        m = 0\n        for a from n-1 down to 0:\n            j = 0\n            while (bb[a] > 0) {\n                if (aa[j] >= a + k) then bb[a]--\n                j++\n            }\n            then we shift the elements in aa from j to m-1 to the right by one, and set aa[j] = a, and then m++.\n\n        This algorithm is known as \"reconstruction\" of a permutation from an inversion-like array? \n\n        We must simulate this to be safe? Because if the input bb is invalid, the while loop might run forever? For example, if bb[a] is too large? But the constraints say bb[i] is between 0 and n-1. And the algorithm is designed for that.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, k, and bb(1..n) [Note: in Java, arrays are 0-indexed, in Fortran we can use 1-indexed? But the algorithm uses 0-indexed in the original. We can use 0-indexed arrays in Fortran? Or adjust indices?]\n\n        How to handle indices?\n\n          In the original Java:\n            bb has indices 0 to n-1.\n            aa has indices 0 to n-1.\n\n          We can do the same in Fortran by using arrays with base 0? Or we can use base 1 and adjust the arithmetic.\n\n          Let me adjust:\n\n            We let bb(1) correspond to bb[0], bb(2) to bb[1], ... bb(n) to bb[n-1].\n            Similarly, aa(1) to aa[0], ... aa(n) to aa[n-1].\n\n          The loop: a from n-1 down to 0 -> in Fortran, we can do a = n-1, n-2, ..., 0.\n\n          But note: in the condition: aa[j] >= a + k -> j is an index in the partially built aa array? The array aa at the time of the while loop has the first m elements set (from previous steps).\n\n          We can do:\n\n            integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: aa, bb\n            integer :: n, k, m, a, j, j_, i, temp\n            ! Read n, k, and bb\n            ! Allocate aa with size n, and initialize to 0? (like Java) -> but the algorithm uses the current values in aa.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            m = 0  ! m is the current size of aa that is filled? Actually, m is the number of elements in aa that are set so far.\n\n            do a = n-1, 0, -1   ! a from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            However, Fortran doesn't naturally do 0-indexed loops? We can do:\n\n                a_val = a   ! but a is integer that goes from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            But note: we are storing integers in aa, not indices? The values stored in aa are the numbers a (which are from 0 to n-1). \n\n          How to simulate the while loop?\n\n            j = 1   ! but wait: in Java j starts at 0. In Fortran, if we are using base 1 for aa, then the first element is aa(1). So we must use base 0 for the array indices in the algorithm? Or we can use base 1 and adjust the indices.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use 0-indexed arrays? Fortran allows:\n\n            integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: aa, bb\n\n          Then:\n\n            read n, k\n            allocate(bb(0:n-1))\n            do i = 0, n-1\n                read *, bb(i)\n            end do\n            allocate(aa(0:n-1))\n            aa = 0   ! initialize to 0? Actually, in Java the array is initially zeros? But the algorithm overwrites? Actually, the algorithm shifts so the initial zeros might be overwritten? But the while loop uses the current values.\n\n          Then the algorithm:\n\n            m = 0   ! the current number of elements in aa that are set (meaning the first m elements of the array aa are set, and the rest are zeros? but we are shifting and inserting, so the array aa from index 0 to m-1 is set).\n\n            do a = n-1, 0, -1\n                j = 0   ! we are going to traverse the current aa from index0 to m-1?\n                do while (bb(a) > 0)\n                    if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n                        bb(a) = bb(a) - 1\n                    end if\n                    j = j + 1\n                end do\n\n                ! Now we shift the elements in aa from j to m-1 to the right by one.\n                do j_ = m, j+1, -1   ! j_ from m down to j+1: but note m is the current size? Then we are going to set aa(j_)=aa(j_-1) for j_ from m down to j+1?\n                    aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n                end do\n                aa(j) = a\n                m = m + 1\n            end do\n\n          Then we have the array aa(0:n-1) with the permutation.\n\n          But note: we don't use aa for output? The second program only requires the number of tokens (which is n). So we don't need to build the string.\n\n          However, we must run the algorithm because:\n\n            1. It might crash for invalid input (so we do the same?).\n            2. It modifies bb? And if we don't run it, we don't modify bb? But the second program doesn't use bb. But the problem says \"the entire sequence\", meaning the entire state? \n\n          But the second program runs in a separate process? So the modification of bb in the first program is not seen by the second program? Only the output string is passed.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to simulate the side effect on bb? Because the second program does not use it.\n\n          However, the while loop condition depends on bb(a). But note: we are modifying bb(a) in the while loop. So we must update bb? Because the condition in the while loop is on the current value of bb(a). \n\n          So we must simulate the entire algorithm to update bb? But then we don't use bb again? \n\n          Therefore, we must run the entire algorithm for the first program? Because the algorithm updates bb during the while loop? And the condition of the while loop is on the current bb(a). So we cannot skip.\n\n          So plan:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, k, and the array bb(0:n-1).\n            Step 2: Allocate aa(0:n-1) and initialize to 0? Actually, we are going to overwrite the aa array by shifting and inserting, so we don't need to initialize? But the while loop uses the current values of aa(j) for j from 0 to m-1? And initially m=0, so the while loop for the first a (a=n-1) will not enter the while loop (because initially m=0, so j=0 and then we break the while loop without any iteration? because j is 0 and then we do the shift for j=0: then set aa(0)=a. Then m becomes 1.\n\n            Then next a = n-2: then we start with j=0, and then we check bb(a) (which is the original bb(n-2) modified? Actually, in the while loop we decrement bb(a) only when we see an element in aa that is >= a+k. But note: we are modifying bb(a) during the while loop.\n\n          Therefore, we must simulate the entire algorithm to update bb? And then the shifting of aa? \n\n          But note: the output of the chain is n, which is independent of the computation? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must do the same array operations? \n\n          So we write the algorithm as in the first program.\n\n          Then we don't output the array aa? We only use it to compute the next step? But we don't use it for the second program? The second program only depends on the number of tokens (which is n) and the absence of \"0\". \n\n          Therefore, after we compute aa, we know the second program will output n.\n\n          Then we print n.\n\n          But note: the first program might output a different number of tokens? We are sure it outputs n tokens? \n\n          So the Fortran program:\n\n            program combined\n              implicit none\n              integer :: n, k, i, m, a, j, j_, temp\n              integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: aa, bb\n              ! Read n and k\n              read(*,*) n, k\n              allocate(bb(0:n-1))\n              do i = 0, n-1\n                read(*,*) bb(i)\n              end do\n              allocate(aa(0:n-1))\n              ! Initialize aa? We are going to overwrite by the algorithm, but the while loop accesses aa(j) which might be uninitialized? \n              ! In Java, aa is initialized to 0. So we initialize aa to 0.\n              aa = 0\n              m = 0   ! current size of aa that is filled (from index0 to m-1)\n\n              ! Loop a from n-1 down to 0\n              do a = n-1, 0, -1\n                j = 0\n                ! While bb(a) > 0: but note j must be within the current size? In the original, j starts at 0 and then increments until it reaches m? But the condition is only on bb(a). Also, if j becomes m, then we break the while loop? Because then we have processed all current elements? But the condition is only on bb(a). It might break early? \n                do while (bb(a) > 0)\n                  ! If j is beyond the current size? The original doesn't check j against m? But m is the current size, so j from 0 to m-1. But the while loop condition doesn't depend on j. So we must ensure we don't access aa(j) beyond m-1? \n\n                  ! In the original: the while loop runs without checking j against m. But if bb(a) remains positive and j becomes m, then we access aa[m] which is uninitialized? Actually, no: the array aa is allocated for n elements and we initialized to 0. So it would be 0. \n\n                  ! Condition: if (aa(j) >= a + k) then decrement bb(a)\n                  if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n                    bb(a) = bb(a) - 1\n                  end if\n                  j = j + 1\n                  ! But what if j becomes greater than n-1? Then we break? The original doesn't break? It would crash? But the constraints say that the input is valid? So we assume j remains within bounds.\n\n                  ! How to avoid infinite loop? The problem says the input is valid? So we assume the while loop terminates? \n                end do\n\n                ! Now we shift the elements in aa from j to m-1 to the right by one.\n                ! We are going to insert at position j.\n                ! Shift: for positions from m down to j+1: aa(i) = aa(i-1)\n                if (m > 0) then\n                  do j_ = m, j+1, -1\n                    aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n                  end do\n                end if\n                aa(j) = a\n                m = m + 1\n              end do\n\n              ! Now the first program would have printed aa(i)+1 for i=0 to n-1, which is n tokens and no token is zero.\n              ! Then the second program outputs the index of the first zero or the total count? We know it outputs n.\n              print *, n\n\n              deallocate(aa, bb)\n            end program\n\n   But note: the while loop condition: do while (bb(a) > 0). What if bb(a) is large? The constraints say bb(a) is between 0 and n-1? So it will terminate? \n\n   However, we must be cautious: the inner while loop might run many times? But the condition is that we decrement bb(a) only when we see an element in aa that is >= a+k. The number of such elements is at most m (the current size). So j can run up to m, which is at most n. So the while loop runs at most n times? \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's test with a small example? But the problem says we can assume valid input.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program as above.\n\n   However, note: the original Java program uses 0-indexed arrays. We are using 0-indexed arrays in Fortran? We declared:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: aa, bb\n\n   But in the shift part: we are shifting from j to m-1? \n\n        We have aa(0:m-1) is set. We want to shift the segment [j, m-1] to [j+1, m]? \n\n        Example: \n          j=0: then we shift the entire segment [0, m-1] to [1, m]. Then set aa(0)=a.\n          j=m: then we don't shift? and set aa(m)=a.\n\n        So the shift loop:\n\n          do j_ = m, j+1, -1\n            aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n          end do\n\n        This is correct: \n          j_ from m down to j+1: \n            aa(m) = aa(m-1)\n            aa(m-1) = aa(m-2)\n            ...\n            aa(j+1) = aa(j)\n\n        Then we set aa(j)=a.\n\n        And then m becomes m+1.\n\n   This matches the Java:\n\n        for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But note: in the while loop, we are using j starting at 0 and then incrementing until we break? But the condition is only on bb(a). However, the while loop condition is (bb(a)>0). So when bb(a) becomes 0, we break.\n\n   But what if bb(a) is 0 initially? Then we skip the while loop: j remains 0.\n\n   Then we shift: if m>0 and j=0, then we shift from m down to 1: \n        j_ from m down to 1: \n            aa(1) = aa(0)   -> but wait: we are shifting the entire segment to the right? \n\n   Actually, the shift is for positions from j to m-1? We are shifting them to j+1 to m. \n\n   But note: the array aa is of size 0:n-1. We are only using indices 0 to m-1 (before the shift). Then we are setting aa(j) and increasing m to m+1.\n\n   So the shift must be for indices from j to m-1? But we are shifting from the last element backwards.\n\n   The Java code:\n\n        for (int j_ = m; j_ > j; j_--)   // m is the current size (number of elements) and we are going to set aa[j] = a, so we shift the elements from j to m-1 to j+1 to m.\n\n        In Fortran, our loop:\n\n          do j_ = m, j+1, -1\n            aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n          end do\n\n        This is the same.\n\n   So the program is:\n\n      Note: We are using 0-indexed arrays. We read the input with the first two integers n and k, then n integers for bb(0) to bb(n-1).\n\n   Finally, we output n.\n\n   However, note: the second program in the original chain outputs n? But what if the first program outputs a string that has more than n tokens? We are sure it has n tokens? \n\n   Therefore, we output n.\n\n   But wait: the second program counts the tokens until it finds a zero? And if it doesn't find a zero, it counts all tokens. We know there are n tokens. So we output n.\n\n   So the final Fortran program:\n\n      We assume the input is as described.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\".\n\n   We are reading at the beginning and outputting at the end.\n\n   We do the intermediate computation without I/O.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Code:\n\n      Note: We are using 0-indexed arrays. Fortran allows 0-indexed arrays by declaring (0:n-1).\n\n   But note: the read statement: we read the integers for bb. We can read them in a loop for i=0 to n-1.\n\n   Example input:\n\n        n=3, k=0, bb = [0,0,0]\n\n   Then the algorithm:\n\n        a = 2 (n-1=2): \n            j=0\n            while (bb(2)>0) -> false, so skip.\n            then shift: m=0 -> j=0: we don't shift? Then set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1:\n            j=0\n            while (bb(1)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: now m=1, j=0: we shift from m=1 down to j+1=1: so j_=1: then aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=2, then set aa(0)=1. m=2.\n\n        a=0:\n            j=0\n            while (bb(0)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: m=2, j=0: shift from m=2 down to 1: \n                aa(2)=aa(1) -> aa(2)=2\n                aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=1\n            then set aa(0)=0, m=3.\n\n        Then the first program would output: \n            aa[0]+1 = 1, aa[1]+1=2, aa[2]+1=3 -> \"1 2 3 \"\n\n        The second program: tokens = [1,2,3] -> count until zero: not found, so count=3 -> output 3.\n\n        Our program outputs 3.\n\n   Another example: n=3, k=1, bb = [0,0,0]\n\n        a=2: \n            j=0 -> skip while.\n            set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1:\n            j=0: while (bb(1)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: aa(1)=aa(0)=2, then set aa(0)=1 -> aa(0)=1, aa(1)=2, m=2.\n\n        a=0:\n            j=0: while (bb(0)=0) -> skip.\n            shift: aa(2)=aa(1)=2, aa(1)=aa(0)=1, set aa(0)=0 -> aa=[0,1,2]\n            output: 1,2,3 -> same as above.\n\n        Then output 3.\n\n   But what if bb is not zero? Example: n=3, k=1, bb=[0,1,0]\n\n        a=2 (which is the last element, index2): \n            bb(2)=0 -> skip while. Then set aa(0)=2, m=1.\n\n        a=1 (index1): \n            bb(1)=1>0 -> enter while.\n                j=0: aa(0)=2. Check: 2>=1+1 -> 2>=2 -> true -> so bb(1) becomes 0, then j becomes 1 -> break while.\n            Then we shift: from m=1 (current elements at index0) to j+1=2? \n                Actually, we are going to shift from m=1 down to j+1? j=1: j+1=2 -> but m=1, so the loop: j_ from 1 down to 2? step is -1: so if 1>=2? no -> skip.\n            Then set aa(j)=aa(1)=? -> we set aa(1)=1. Then m=2. Now aa(0)=2, aa(1)=1.\n\n        a=0 (index0): \n            bb(0)=0 -> skip.\n            shift: j=0 -> shift from m=2 down to j+1=1: \n                j_=2: aa(2)=aa(1)=1\n                j_=1: then we would do? but we stop at j+1=1? so we do j_=2 and then j_=1? condition: j_ from 2 to 1 step -1: so we do j_=2 and then j_=1? \n                But note: the loop: \n                    do j_ = m, j+1, -1   -> m=2, j+1=1 -> so j_=2, then 1? \n                So: \n                    aa(2)=aa(1) -> aa(2)=1\n                    aa(1)=aa(0) -> aa(1)=2\n                Then set aa(0)=0 -> aa(0)=0, aa(1)=2, aa(2)=1.\n            Then output: 1, 3, 2.\n\n        The second program: tokens = [1,3,2] -> no zero, so output 3.\n\n        Our program outputs 3.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program as described.\n\n   However, note: the shifting loop: \n\n        do j_ = m, j+1, -1\n\n        But m is the current size (the next free index is at m). We are shifting from m down to j+1? \n\n        Example: if j=0 and m=1: then we do j_ from 1 down to 1? so we do j_=1: then aa(1)=aa(0). Then set aa(0)=a.\n\n        That matches.\n\n   Code:\n\n      We use free form Fortran.\n\n      Note: The array indices: we use 0-indexed.\n\n      We assume n<=1000? But we allocate dynamically.\n\n      We read from standard input.\n\n      We output n at the end.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly."
