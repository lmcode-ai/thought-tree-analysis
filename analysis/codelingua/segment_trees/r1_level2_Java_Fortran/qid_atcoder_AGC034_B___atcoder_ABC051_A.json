Therefore, the Fortran program can be:\n\n  - Read the input string (as a token, i.e., a word). - Process the string: replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". We can do this by scanning the string and building a new string. Note: the original replacement is global and non-overlapping. We can do:\n        new_string = ''\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= len_trim(input)) if (i < len_trim(input) and input(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                new_string = trim(new_string) // 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                new_string = trim(new_string) // input(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n  - Then, traverse the new_string and do the counting.\n\n  But note: the original Java program uses `replaceAll` which uses regex and replaces all occurrences. We must do the same: non-overlapping and left-to-right. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = trim(input)\n        do while (index(s, \"BC\") > 0)\n            pos = index(s, \"BC\")\n            ! Replace the \"BC\" at position pos to pos+1 with 'D'\n            s = s(1:pos-1) // 'D' // s(pos+2:)\n        end do But that might be inefficient for long strings. But the problem constraints?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_AGC034_B) processes a string and outputs a long integer. The second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces commas with spaces.\n\nHowever, note the sequence: \n  Input -> Program 1 (outputs a long integer) -> Program 2 (which expects a string and replaces commas with spaces)\n\nBut wait: the output of Program 1 is a long integer (as a string without commas) and the input to Program 2 is that integer as a string? Then Program 2 would replace commas in that string. However, the integer string does not contain commas, so replacing commas would have no effect. Then it just outputs the same integer string? \n\nBut let's look at the original Java programs:\n\nProgram 1 (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n  - Reads a string (for example, it could be \"ABCBC\").\n  - Replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". So \"ABCBC\" becomes \"ADDC\"? Actually: \n      Original: \"ABCBC\" -> \n          First \"BC\" becomes D: so \"A\" + \"D\" and then the next two? Actually, the string \"ABCBC\": \n          The first two characters are 'A' and then 'B' -> but then we have \"BC\" at index1-2? \n          Actually, the example: \n            Input: \"ABCBC\" -> replace \"BC\" with \"D\": so the first \"BC\" is at positions 1 and 2 (0-indexed: index1 and index2). Then the next \"BC\" would be at positions 3 and 4? But after replacing the first \"BC\" we get \"AD\" and then \"BC\" becomes at positions 2 and 3? Actually, the replacement is done on the entire string at once? In Java, replaceAll uses regex and replaces all non-overlapping occurrences. So \"ABCBC\" becomes \"ADC\" (because the first \"BC\" is replaced by \"D\", then we have \"B\" and \"C\" left? but note: the replacement is done on the entire string, and the next \"BC\" is not overlapping? Actually, after replacing the first \"BC\", the string becomes \"ADC\", because the second \"BC\" is now gone? Actually, wait: \n            Original: \"ABCBC\" \n            Step: Replace \"BC\" with \"D\": \n                The first two characters are 'A' and then the next two form \"BC\" -> replace that -> \"A\" + \"D\" and then the rest is \"BC\"? \n                But then the next two are \"BC\" again? So the entire string becomes \"ADC\" -> no, because the replacement is global and non-overlapping. The two replacements would occur? Actually, the string \"ABCBC\" has two non-overlapping \"BC\": \n                    [0]='A', [1]='B', [2]='C', [3]='B', [4]='C'\n                The first \"BC\" is at indices 1-2, then the next at 3-4. So after replacement we get \"A\" + \"D\" + \"D\" -> \"ADD\". \n\n  Then the program counts: \n      tmp = 0\n      for each char in the string:\n        if char == 'A', then tmp++\n        else if char == 'D', then cnt += tmp\n        else (meaning if it's 'B' or 'C') then tmp = 0\n\n  So in \"ADD\": \n      i0: 'A' -> tmp=1\n      i1: 'D' -> cnt += tmp (so cnt=1)\n      i2: 'D' -> cnt += tmp (so cnt=2)\n\n  Then output is 2.\n\nProgram 2: \n  Reads a line and replaces every comma with a space. Then prints.\n\nBut note: the output of Program1 is the integer 2 (without commas). So the input to Program2 is the string \"2\". There are no commas, so it becomes \"2\" and is printed.\n\nSo the entire sequence: \n  Input: a string (like \"ABCBC\")\n  Output: the integer 2 (as a string without commas)\n\nBut wait: the second program replaces commas. Why would we need that? Actually, the second program is designed to process a string that might have commas. However, the output of the first program is a number without commas. So the second program doesn't change it.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. So we have to combine both.\n\nHowever, note the second program is named atcoder_ABC051_A and it is a completely different problem. It seems that the two programs are independent and we are chaining them arbitrarily.\n\nBut the instruction says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nSo the chain is:\n  Input (string) -> Program1 (which outputs an integer) -> Program2 (which expects a string and replaces commas by spaces) -> Output\n\nBut the output of Program1 is an integer (as a string without commas) and Program2 will just output the same string? \n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to: \n  Read a string S.\n  Process S as in Program1 to get an integer N.\n  Convert N to a string and output it (without any change, because there are no commas).\n\nBut wait: what if the integer N is large and has commas? Actually, in the first program, the output is via `out.println(cnt)`, which prints the number without any formatting (no commas). So the string representation of the number does not contain commas.\n\nTherefore, the second program is effectively a no-op? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we have to do:\n\n  Step1: Read the initial string.\n  Step2: Process as in Program1 (replace \"BC\" by \"D\", then count the operations) to get a long integer.\n  Step3: Convert that long integer to a string (without commas) and then output that string.\n\nHowever, note that the second program is reading a whole line and then replacing commas. But the output of the first program is a single integer and then a newline? So when the second program reads a line, it gets the integer as a string (without commas) and then replaces commas (which does nothing) and then prints the same string.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to: \n  Read a string S (without newline? Actually, the first program uses `in.next()` which reads tokens, so it might not read the entire line? But the input is one token? The problem doesn't specify. However, the second program uses `readLine()` so it would read the entire line. \n\nBut note: the first program outputs a single integer and then a newline (because of `println`). The second program reads a line (so the entire line including the newline? Actually, `readLine()` in Java does not include the newline). Then it replaces commas in that line? So the line is the string of the integer without commas and without trailing newline? Then it appends that replaced string to a StringBuilder and prints it? So it prints the integer string without commas and without any extra spaces? Then it adds a newline? Actually, the second program does `System.out.println(sb)`, which prints the string and then a newline.\n\nBut note: the first program already printed a newline? And then the second program reads that entire line (without the newline) and then prints the same string and then a newline? So the output is the same integer string but with a newline? Actually, the first program's output is the integer and a newline. The second program reads the integer without the newline? (because `readLine()` removes the newline) and then prints the integer string and a newline. So the output is the same? \n\nSo the entire chain: the output is the integer and a newline.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should:\n  - Read a string (the initial input, which is one token? or one line? The first program uses `in.next()`, which reads until whitespace. But the problem does not specify. However, the sample input might be a string without spaces. We'll assume the input is one line? But the problem says: the entire sequence. \n\nBut note: the first program uses `in.next()`, which is a token. The second program reads a whole line. However, the output of the first program is one token (the integer) and then a newline. The second program reads a whole line and gets the integer without the newline? \n\nBut to be safe, we must note: the input to the first program is a single token? So we can read a token in Fortran? Or we can read the entire line? \n\nThe problem says: \"behaves identically\". The input to the first program is a token (without spaces). So we can read a token (using Fortran's read without advancing? or just read a word). \n\nBut the problem does not specify the input. However, the typical input for the first program is a string of A, B, and C. It doesn't have spaces. So we can read the entire line? \n\nAlternatively, we can read a single word. \n\nBut in Fortran, if we read a character variable with `read(*,*) input`, it will read a token (until space). So that matches the first program.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  1. Read a string (token) from standard input.\n  2. Replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\" in that string. But note: in Fortran, we cannot change the length of the string arbitrarily. We can create a new string? Or we can process without replacement? Actually, the original program replaced \"BC\" with \"D\", which shortens the string. We can create a new string by scanning and building.\n\n  3. Then, traverse the new string and count:\n        tmp = 0\n        cnt = 0\n        for each character in the string:\n            if character == 'A', then tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if character == 'D', then cnt = cnt + tmp\n            else (meaning 'B' or 'C' or any other? but the original string only has A, B, C and we replaced BC by D, so we only have A, D, and then leftover B and C? Actually, after replacement, we have:\n                The replacement is done globally, so we don't have \"BC\" anymore, but we might have 'B' or 'C' that are not part of \"BC\". So the else branch is for any character that is not 'A' and not 'D'. In the original, the else branch sets tmp=0.\n\n  4. Then we have the integer cnt.\n\n  5. Then we output the integer cnt (without any commas) and then a newline.\n\nBut wait: the second program in the chain is redundant? Because it only replaces commas and the integer doesn't have commas. So we can skip the second program? \n\nBut the problem says: translate the entire sequence. However, the second program does nothing. So we can simply output the integer as a string without any processing? \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be:\n\n  - Read the input string (as a token, i.e., a word).\n  - Process the string: replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". We can do this by scanning the string and building a new string. Note: the original replacement is global and non-overlapping. We can do:\n        new_string = ''\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= len_trim(input))\n            if (i < len_trim(input) and input(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                new_string = trim(new_string) // 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                new_string = trim(new_string) // input(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n  - Then, traverse the new_string and do the counting.\n\n  But note: the original Java program uses `replaceAll` which uses regex and replaces all occurrences. We must do the same: non-overlapping and left-to-right.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = trim(input)\n        do while (index(s, \"BC\") > 0)\n            pos = index(s, \"BC\")\n            ! Replace the \"BC\" at position pos to pos+1 with 'D'\n            s = s(1:pos-1) // 'D' // s(pos+2:)\n        end do\n\n  But that might be inefficient for long strings. But the problem constraints? We don't know. We can do a one-pass scanning to build the new string.\n\n  Let me do:\n\n        character(len=200000) :: s, t\n        integer :: i, n\n\n        read(*,*) s   ! read the token\n        n = len_trim(s)\n        t = ''        ! but we need to build t\n\n        i = 1\n        do while (i <= n)\n            if (i <= n-1 .and. s(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                t = trim(t) // 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                t = trim(t) // s(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n  But note: the length of t may be shorter. We don't know the exact length. We can preallocate t to the same length as s? But then we can use an integer index to build without trim which is inefficient.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        character(len=200000) :: s, t\n        integer :: i, j, n\n\n        read(*,*) s\n        n = len_trim(s)\n        t = ''   ! initialize to empty\n\n        i = 1\n        j = 0\n        do while (i <= n)\n            if (i < n .and. s(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                ! We are going to put a 'D'\n                j = j + 1\n                t(j:j) = 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n            else\n                j = j + 1\n                t(j:j) = s(i:i)\n                i = i + 1\n            endif\n        end do\n\n        ! Now t(1:j) is the new string\n\n  But we have to set the length of t? Actually, we can use j as the effective length.\n\n  Then we do:\n\n        tmp = 0\n        cnt = 0\n        do i = 1, j\n            if (t(i:i) == 'A') then\n                tmp = tmp + 1\n            else if (t(i:i) == 'D') then\n                cnt = cnt + tmp\n            else\n                tmp = 0\n            endif\n        end do\n\n  6. Then write the integer cnt to stdout.\n\nHowever, note: the second program in the chain would output the integer without commas and then a newline. So we can simply write:\n\n        write(*,*) cnt\n\n  But Fortran by default writes integers with a space at the beginning? And also, if the number is large, it might break into lines? We don't want that.\n\n  We can use:\n\n        write(*,'(I0)') cnt\n\n  This writes the integer without any leading/trailing spaces and without commas.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without formatting? But the default might add a space. We want exactly the digits and then a newline.\n\n  The problem: the second program outputs the integer as a string without commas and then a newline. So we do the same.\n\nBut note: the original first program outputs a long integer. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) if necessary? The Java program uses `long cnt`. So we should use a 64-bit integer.\n\nSo:\n\n        integer(kind=8) :: tmp, cnt\n\n  However, the input string length? The problem doesn't specify. But the counting might be large? So we use integer(kind=8) for tmp and cnt.\n\nSteps:\n\n  1. Read the input string (we assume maximum length 200000? but the problem doesn't specify. We can use a large enough length).\n  2. Build the new string t by replacing every \"BC\" with \"D\". We traverse the original string and build the new one without the \"B\" in \"BC\" and replacing both with a single 'D'. We use an index j for the new string.\n  3. Traverse the new string (from 1 to j) and do the counting.\n  4. Write the integer cnt without any formatting (using I0 format) to avoid extra spaces.\n\nBut note: the input string might be long. We have to set the character variable length to a maximum. The problem doesn't specify, but we can set it to 200000.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nImportant: We must not do any I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program:\n\n```fortran\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200000) :: s, t\n    integer :: i, j, n\n    integer(kind=8) :: tmp, cnt  ! to match Java's long\n\n    ! Read the input string (as a single token, which is the entire word)\n    read(*,*) s\n    n = len_trim(s)\n\n    ! Build the new string t by replacing \"BC\" with \"D\"\n    t = ''  ! Initialize to blanks? Actually, we are going to assign by index, so we can set to blanks and then assign.\n    j = 0\n    i = 1\n    do while (i <= n)\n        if (i < n) then\n            if (s(i:i+1) == \"BC\") then\n                j = j + 1\n                t(j:j) = 'D'\n                i = i + 2\n                cycle\n            end if\n        end if\n        ! If we are here, we take one character\n        j = j + 1\n        t(j:j) = s(i:i)\n        i = i + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Now traverse t(1:j) to compute cnt\n    tmp = 0\n    cnt = 0\n    do i = 1, j\n        if (t(i:i) == 'A') then\n            tmp = tmp + 1\n        else if (t(i:i) == 'D') then\n            cnt = cnt + tmp\n        else\n            tmp = 0\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the integer without any extra spaces and a newline\n    write(*,'(I0)') cnt\n\nend program main\n```\n\nBut note: what if the string is empty? Then j=0, and the loop for t is from 1 to 0? That's okay in Fortran? Actually, the loop will not run.\n\nLet me test with the example: \"ABCBC\" -> becomes \"ADD\" (with j=3). Then:\n  i=1: 'A' -> tmp=1\n  i=2: 'D' -> cnt += 1 -> cnt=1\n  i=3: 'D' -> cnt += 1 -> cnt=2\n\nOutput: 2.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut note: the replacement must be non-overlapping and left-to-right. Our loop does that: it starts at the beginning and when it finds \"BC\", it replaces and skips two. Otherwise, it takes one.\n\nBut what about \"BABC\"? \n  Original: \"BABC\" \n  Step1: \n      i=1: 'B' -> not \"BC\", so t(1)='B', j=1, i=2.\n      i=2: 'A' -> t(2)='A', j=2, i=3.\n      i=3: then i=3 and n=4 -> check s(3:4)=\"BC\" -> replace with 'D', so t(3)='D', j=3, i=5 -> done.\n  Then t = \"BAD\" (but only the first 3 characters).\n  Then counting:\n      i=1: 'B' -> tmp=0 (because not 'A' and not 'D'? Actually, it's else: set tmp=0)\n      i=2: 'A' -> tmp=1\n      i=3: 'D' -> cnt += tmp -> cnt=1\n\n  So output 1.\n\nIn the original program: \n  s = \"BABC\".replaceAll(\"BC\",\"D\") -> \"BABC\" becomes \"BAD\" (because the last two are \"BC\" -> replaced by 'D'). Then counting: \n      i0: 'B' -> tmp=0\n      i1: 'A' -> tmp=1\n      i2: 'D' -> cnt=1\n\nSo it matches.\n\nEdge: \"BC\" -> becomes \"D\", then counting: \n      i0: 'D' -> cnt += tmp (which is 0) -> cnt=0.\n\nAnother: \"A\" -> remains \"A\", then tmp=1, then no D -> cnt=0.\n\nBut note: the original program: \n  for \"A\": \n      tmp=1 -> then no D -> output 0.\n\nBut what about \"AB\"? \n  becomes \"AB\" (no replacement) -> \n      i0: 'A' -> tmp=1\n      i1: 'B' -> else: tmp=0 -> then output 0.\n\nIt matches.\n\nTherefore, the program should be as above.\n\nHowever, note: the second program in the chain is redundant? But we are skipping it because it doesn't change the output? So we are effectively doing the same as the chain? \n\nYes, because the output of the first program is the integer without commas and the second program leaves it unchanged. So we can output the integer directly.\n\nSo the above Fortran program is the entire sequence.\n\nBut note: the original first program uses `in.next()`, which stops at whitespace. Our Fortran read(*,*) s also stops at whitespace. So we are reading one token.\n\nWe assume the input has no spaces? The problem doesn't specify, but the context is a string of A, B, C.\n\nWe'll write the program accordingly.\n\nOne more note: the maximum length of the input string. We set 200000. If the problem requires more, we must adjust. But the problem doesn't specify. We'll use 200000.\n\nAlternatively, we can use allocatable characters? But the problem doesn't specify the constraints. However, for online judges, 200000 is typical.\n\nFinal code:"
